Proper optimization for the <b>aqueous</b> based film <b>coating</b> formulation was undertaken primarily employing plasticizers like polyethylene glycol (PEG) 400 and propylene glycol (PG). The defect free selected formulations were further subjected for studying the effects of surfactants like sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) and Tween- 80 along with the plasticizers. The quality of the <b>aqueous</b> film <b>coats</b> or the plasticizer efficiency in case of PEG- 400 is in the order 1. 5 > 0. 5 > 1. 0 % and for PG 1 > 4 > 3 % which can be stated on the basis of less incidence of major coat defects like chipping, cracking, orange peel, roughness, blistering, blooming, picking. The quality of <b>aqueous</b> film <b>coat</b> or the surfactant efficiency in case of SLS+PEG- 400 is in the order 0. 3 < 0. 5 < 0. 1 % and SLS+PG is in the order 0. 5 < 0. 1 < 0. 3 %.

We have examined the film forming and coating properties of heat-treated fibroin, SF solution having different amounts of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) cross-linked SF. Heat-treated SF material possessed a brittle structure, which resulted in poor film forming and coating properties. The optimum PEG amount in SF solution was determined as 17 % (by weight) for an acceptable film forming and zero order release profile. EDC cross-linked SF has shown a very good film forming and coating property with a potential for sustaining the drug release from coated theophylline tablets. Dissolution data for coated theophylline tablets were analyzed using Ritger and Peppas equation to describe the mechanism of drug release.

40|$|Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), {{which is}} {{available}} in different degrees of substitution and viscosity designations, {{is one of the}} most commonly used cellulosic polymers in <b>aqueous</b> film <b>coating.</b> It is relatively easy to process due to its non-tacky nature and has been known to produce smooth and clear films. For <b>aqueous</b> film <b>coating,</b> it is cost effective to use a coating formulation containing a high concentration of polymer without affecting the viscosity or spray rate and compromising on the quality of the film coat. Hence, it is ideal to use a polymer of low viscosity grade. The rheological properties of HPMC with various viscosity grades were determined. It was found that HPMC Methocel E 3 had the lowest viscosity and was the least affected by the increase in polymer concentration. Additives can modify the film properties, including the glass transition temperature of the coating polymer. Glass transition temperature influences the viscosity of the coating solution and the mechanical properties, adhesion and permeability of the film coat. Various concentrations of different additives were incorporated in HPMC formulations to study the effect on these properties. Some long-chain fatty acids were included in the study to investigate if their hydrophobic carbon chains could retard moisture permeation of HPMC films. It was observed that HPMC films containing water-soluble additives produce films with clarity similar to those without additives, whereas those with hydrophobic additives tend to be patchy or hazy in appearance. A vinyl pyrrolidone / vinyl acetate copolymer (S 630) was investigated for its influence on HPMC films, comparing the results with a commonly used plasticizer, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and another copolymer, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Intrinsic properties of the solutions, such as viscosity and glass transition temperature, were evaluated. The effect of S 630 on the film properties, such as physical appearance, surface roughness, moisture permeation and mechanical properties, as well as its ability to promote better adhesion of the film coat to the core surface, were compared. S 630 was found to be effective both as a film-former and plasticizer, reducing the glass transition temperature and viscosity, but enhancing the tensile strength, elongation and work of failure of the cast film. The water vapour permeability was slightly increased but not to the same extent as with polyethylene glycol PEG). A 10 % concentration of this copolymer increased the adhesive strength and toughness of the HPMC film <b>coat.</b> <b>Aqueous</b> film <b>coating</b> was carried out in the ultra-coater, using HPMC coating formulations containing 8 % w/w of solids, without or with 10 % concentration (based on dry weight of total solids) of the additives, PEG, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and S 630, for coating the tablets. Capsule-shaped lactose tablet cores of specific surface area, hardness, weight, friability and disintegration time were used to study the process variables. Process variables, including air flow rate, temperature and humidity, coating application rate or pump flow rate, atomising air pressure and speed of the rotating disk, were investigated in order to obtain the optimum operating conditions for these solutions.

40|$|In this study, {{an attempt}} was made to improve the packing density of calcium {{phosphate}} (CaP) coating on a magnesium alloy by tailoring the coating solution for enhanced degradation resistance of the alloy for implant applications. An organic solvent, ethanol, was added to the coating solution to decrease the conductivity of the coating solution so that hydrogen bubble formation/bursting reduces during the CaP coating process. Experimental results confirmed that ethanol addition to the coating solution reduces the conductivity of the solution and also decreases the hydrogen evolution/bubble bursting. In vitro electrochemical experiments, that is, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and potentiodynamic polarization showed that CaP coating produced in 30 % (v/v) ethanol containing coating solution (3 E) exhibits significantly higher degradation resistance (i. e., ~ 50 % higher polarization resistance and ~ 60 % lower corrosion current) than the aqueous solution coating. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis of the coatings revealed that the packing of 3 E coating was denser than that of <b>aqueous</b> <b>coating,</b> which {{can be attributed to the}} lower hydrogen evolution in the former than in the latter.

Near infrared (nIR) absorption spectra, photomicrographs, and some physicochemical properties of the coated tablets were evaluated.

40|$|During {{the past}} 50 years, {{pharmaceutical}} coating {{has gone through}} the transition from sugar coating to organic solvent coating and <b>aqueous</b> <b>coating.</b> Since the 1990 s, <b>aqueous</b> <b>coating</b> has largely phased out organic solvent coating as the dominate coating method for pharmaceutical dosage forms due to the toxicity and environmental related concerns caused by the organic solvents. On the other hand, although prevailing, <b>aqueous</b> <b>coating</b> has other major limitations such as higher energy consumption and longer processing time than the solvent coating. Powder coating has the benefits of both, being environmentally friendly, energy efficient and short processing time, while equally effective in modifying drug release profiles. Consequently, powder coating is pointing to the future as the next breakthrough in pharmaceutical coating. Involving three steps including preheating of the dosage forms, electrostatic deposition of coating powders and film formation (curing), powder coating has been studied to tablet coating with easily coated polymers. The objectives {{of the present study}} are to expand powder coating to more difficult coating materials such as ethylcellulose and cellulose acetate, as well as more difficult dosage forms including small pellets, and in particular, osmotic controlled release tablets. As a water-insoluble polymer, ethylcellulose (EC) is a commonly used coating material for sustained drug release. However, {{it is very difficult to}} coat by powder coating due to its high glass transition temperature (Tg). The present study was successful to coat tablets with fine particles of EC in a rotatable pan coater. With the proper addition of plasticizers, a continuous and uniform coating film was formed. Pore forming agent was added in the coating formulation to adjust the permeability of the coating film to allow a more controlled drug release rate. Currently, small pellets are coated by solvent coating or <b>aqueous</b> <b>coating</b> in a fluidized bed with a larger amount of fluidizing hot air than a pan coater, leading to an extremely high energy consumption. The present study utilized the pan coater instead of a fluidized bed to coat small pellets with powder coating, leading to a significant energy savings by avoiding the use of large amount of fluidizing hot air required to fluidize those pellets and to evaporate the organic solvent or water. Three different coating formulations containing Eudragit® EPO, Eudragit® RS/RL and Acryl EZE were developed to achieve immediate release, sustained release and delayed release, respectively. Particularly, as the only oral drug delivery system capable of achieving constant drug release rate, osmotic drug delivery system (ODDS) is considered as the ultimate ideal drug delivery system. However, only organic solvent coating can be currently used to coat ODDS due to the high Tg of the coating materials. The present study successfully applied powder coating to coat ODDS with cellulose acetate (CA), resulting in a continuous, uniform and functionally acceptable coating film. Both elementary and porosity ODDS were achieved by using this powder coating. Following zero order drug release kinetics, drug release rate from powder coated ODDS varied with different coating levels while was independent with other factors such as drug delivery orifice diameter, pH vale of the release media and agitation speed. Considering that ODDS is the most promising controlled drug release system, the success of powder coating ODDS is a big breakthrough in pharma coating. To fully illustrate the powder coating process, in-depth characterization was carried out to investigate the coating powder deposition and film formation, and their influence factors. Positively related to the coating efficiency, powder deposition was found to be the key of the whole process, which can be promoted by preheating the dosage forms, spraying suitable liquid plasticizer and applying electrostatics for the powder spray. A curing step is necessary after coating powder adhesion to allow deposited particles to coalesce and form a continuous coating film. Finer coating powders, higher curing temperature and longer curing time would lead to a more uniform and smoother coating film...|$|E

Results: The film coated tablets were completely disintegrated within 10 minutes in water media, it was also completely dissolved (more than 85 % of the drug was released) within 30 minutes in pH 6. 8 buffersolutions. The film coated tablets were studied under both long term and accelerated stability study and the results showed no significant variation in physical characteristics, color, hardness, no obvious defects or signs of peeling or chipping. These results reflect that the film coated system Opadry-OY-B- 28920 can be successfully used in order to produce AtC film coated tablet that is protected from environmental conditions such as light and humidity. Conclusion: These findings suggest that aqueous film coating with Opadry-OY-B- 28920 system is an easy and economical approach for preparing stable film coated AtC tablet of immediate release...|$|E
30|$|Choi et al. [10] {{reported}} {{the use of}} porous SiNWs as electrode for supercapacitor in such devices but with Li+ containing electrolyte. Their capacitance is expressed only in force per gram, so no accurate comparison with our results is possible. Desplobain et al. [12] have obtained devices with 320 μF cm− 2 capacitance by using gold-coated porous silicon but in <b>aqueous</b> electrolyte. SiNWs <b>coated</b> with NiO [13, 14] or SiC [15] shows promising performances and cycling ability, but silicon is not the active material and their performances have not been evaluated in the two electrodes devices.|$|R
40|$|The {{anticorrosive}} {{effect of}} protective organic coatings {{is determined by}} the barrier effect of the coating, by the metal/coating interface reactions in the presence of inhibitors or active anticorrosive pigments, and by the adhesion of coatings to the metallic substrates. Optimum anticorrosive effects cannot be achieved unless through complex interaction of these factors. Measures which selectively influence adhesion and inhibition {{in the area of the}} metallic substrate/coating interface are investigated. Emphasis is placed on silane adhesives for improvement of the adhesive strength and of the wet adhesive strength, and on silane adhesives combined with flame treatment processes based on the dental silicoater method. At the sametime, inhibition effects of the silane adhesives and their interaction with other inhibitors are investigated. The studies under review focus on water-dilutable coating systems which are of increasing ecological importance. Comparatively little is known about the characteristics and practical features of <b>aqueous</b> anticorrosive <b>coating</b> systems. (orig.)

40|$|Sol-gel reactions, in general, have to {{take place}} in organic {{solvents}} in order to control the hydrolysis and condensation reaction. This leads to drawbacks in applications, since the organic solvent vapor concnetration has to be controlled for example in ocoating applications for environmental, health or security reasons. For this reason, a reaction route has been developed to produce coating precursors stable against water as solvent. To achieve this, conventional electrostatically stabilized sols obtained either by hydrolysis and condensation or commercially availabe sols (e. g. SiO 2 sols) have been surface modified to reduce the particle-to-particle interaction and electrosterically stabilized precursors compatible to water have been obtained. By use of alkoxy silanes as surface modifiers, water-dispersable nanoparticulate liquid coating systems have been prepared, for example, with boehmite, SiO 2 or TiO 2 as nanoparticles to be crosslinked after coating thermally by inorganic condensation and organic condensation or polymerization reactions. Thus, <b>aqueous</b> sol-gel <b>coating</b> systems have been prepared with EtOH contents below 5 %. In the paper, the basic reaction as well as material properties will be discussed...|$|R
