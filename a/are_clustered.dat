It may be that this represents the remnants of another such monument which has had its stones removed or buried. Several large sarsens south of the Coldrums might represent the remnants of a further such tomb, since destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Homologous {{sequences}} are paralogous if {{they were}} created by a duplication event within the genome. For gene duplication events, if a gene in an organism is duplicated to occupy two different positions in the same genome, then the two copies are paralogous. Paralogous genes often {{belong to the same}} species. They can shape the structure of whole genomes and thus explain genome evolution to a large extent. Examples include the Homeobox (Hox) genes in animals. These genes not only underwent gene duplications within chromosomes but also whole genome duplications. As a result, Hox genes in most vertebrates <b>are</b> <b>clustered</b> across multiple chromosomes with the HoxA-D clusters being the best studied.|$|E

5|$|The Wells Gray-Clearwater {{volcanic}} {{field is}} one of the 10 volcanic areas in Canada associated with recent seismic activity; the others are Castle Rock, Mount Edziza, Mount Cayley, Hoodoo Mountain, The Volcano, Crow Lagoon, Mount Meager, Mount Garibaldi and Nazko Cone. Seismic data suggests that these volcanoes still contain living magma plumbing systems, indicating possible future eruptive activity. Although the available data does not allow a clear conclusion, these observations are further indications that some of Canada's volcanoes are potentially active, and that their associated hazards may be significant. Beneath areas of monogenetic cinder cone activity, such as the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field, the seismicity appears to be more dispersed. In a few cases earthquakes <b>are</b> <b>clustered</b> in time and space, suggestive of volcanic earthquake swarms.|$|E
5|$|The spores are {{spindle-shaped}} to elliptical, have {{a smooth}} surface, and dimensions of 8–11 to 3–4µm. There are both two- and four-spored basidia (spore-bearing cells), {{and they are}} club-shaped, hyaline (translucent), with dimensions of 28–36 by 10–12µm. Cystidia are plentiful, and are found in bundles lined along the tube mouths (as cheilocystidia), or more commonly, singly {{along the sides of}} the tubes (as pleurocystidia). These structures are thin-walled, cylindrical, and measure 48–60 by 7–9µm. The scales on the cap surface comprise more or less erect hyphae with tips that <b>are</b> <b>clustered</b> together. Clamp connections are rare in the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|Chorioactis geaster has a disjunct distribution, and {{has only}} been {{collected}} from Texas and Japan. The first reported collection in Japan was in Kyushu in 1937, {{and then it was}} not collected again in that location until thirty-six years later. In 2006, it was observed in a humid forest near Kawakami, Nara Prefecture. The fungus's natural habitat in Japan is disappearing because of the practice of deforestation and replanting with Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica). This rare mushroom has been put on the list of threatened species in Japan. In Texas, the fungus has been reported in Collin, Hays, Travis, Dallas, Denton, Guadalupe, Tarrant and Hunt counties. Travis, Hays, and Guadalupe counties are in central Texas, while the remainder <b>are</b> <b>clustered</b> together in the northeastern part of the state. Although the species is considered rare due to its globally restricted distribution, it may be locally abundant.|$|E
40|$|Many {{real-world}} datasets can <b>be</b> <b>clustered</b> along multiple dimensions.

Unfortunately, traditional clustering algorithms produce only a single clustering of a dataset, effectively providing a user with just a single view of the data. In this paper, we propose a new clustering algorithm that can discover in an unsupervised manner each clustering dimension along which a dataset can <b>be</b> meaningfully <b>clustered.</b> Its ability to reveal the important clustering dimensions of a dataset in an unsupervised manner is particularly appealing for those users who have no idea of how a dataset can possibly <b>be</b> <b>clustered.</b> We demonstrate its viability on several challenging text classification tasks. 1...|$|R

5|$|Some of the city's {{earliest}} still-standing buildings {{date back}} to the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Although most <b>are</b> <b>clustered</b> around the Old Montreal area, such as the Sulpician Seminary adjacent to Notre Dame Basilica that dates back to 1687, and Château Ramezay, which was built in 1705, examples of early colonial architecture are dotted throughout the city. Situated in Lachine, the Le Ber-Le Moyne House is the oldest complete building in the city. In Point St. Charles visitors can see the Maison Saint-Gabriel, which can trace its history back to 1698. There are many historic buildings in Old Montreal in their original form: Notre Dame of Montreal Basilica, Bonsecours Market, and the 19th‑century headquarters of all major Canadian banks on St. James Street (French: Rue Saint Jacques). Montreal's earliest buildings are characterized by their uniquely French influence and grey stone construction.|$|E
5|$|There are 90 Grade I listed {{buildings}} in Mendip.

The greatest concentrations of Grade I listed buildings are in Wells and Glastonbury. In Wells these <b>are</b> <b>clustered</b> around the 10th-century Cathedral Church of St Andrew, better known as Wells Cathedral, and the 13th-century Bishop's Palace. Glastonbury is the site of the Abbey, where construction started in the 7th century, and its associated buildings. The ruined St Michael's church, damaged in an earthquake of 1275, stands on Glastonbury Tor, where the site shows evidence of occupation from Neolithic times and the Dark Ages. The Chalice Well has been in use since Pre-Christian times. Glastonbury Abbey had a wider influence outside the town: tithe barns were built at Pilton and West Bradley to hold tithes, and a Fish House was built at Meare along with a summer residence for the Abbot (now Manor Farmhouse).|$|E
