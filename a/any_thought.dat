5|$|Farrar {{admitted}} that the marriage was never ideal. He later said that neither had expressed their love to each other, even at {{the early stages of}} marriage. Farrar recounted that Green seemed to lack the coping skills most adults bring to bear in challenging times; when she went into a rage, she sometimes harmed herself or broke things, and rarely gave <b>any</b> <b>thought</b> to whether she was in private or in public during these episodes. By the early 1990s, Farrar worked long hours away from the home to avoid arguments and what he perceived as his wife's shortcomings as a homemaker. When the couple fought, Green responded by treating the children, especially Tim, as small adults and telling them about what their father had done wrong. Swayed by their mother's opinions about their father, the children began to resent and disobey Farrar, to the point where Timothy and Farrar had physical altercations.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} in this hearing was Oppenheimer's earliest testimony about George Eltenton's approach to various Los Alamos scientists, a story that Oppenheimer confessed he had fabricated to protect his friend Haakon Chevalier. Unknown to Oppenheimer, both versions were recorded during his interrogations of a decade before. He was surprised {{on the witness stand}} with transcripts of these, which he had not been given a chance to review. In fact, Oppenheimer had never told Chevalier that he had finally named him, and the testimony had cost Chevalier his job. Both Chevalier and Eltenton confirmed mentioning that they had a way to get information to the Soviets, Eltenton admitting he said this to Chevalier and Chevalier admitting he mentioned it to Oppenheimer, but both put the matter in terms of gossip and denied <b>any</b> <b>thought</b> or suggestion of treason or thoughts of espionage, either in planning or in deed. Neither was ever convicted of any crime.|$|E

25|$|In practice, however, no dispute from Tokelau {{has ever}} been litigated outside Tokelau. There has been a strong {{community}} feeling that disputes are matters for {{the community and the}} community alone. This has meant that, to date, community thinking has been opposed to <b>any</b> <b>thought</b> of having a case decided in another village, let alone outside Tokelau.|$|E
25|$|Rarely was <b>any</b> <b>thought</b> {{given to}} the artistic {{heritage}} of these cities in 1566, though families were sometimes able to protect the church monuments of their ancestors, and in Delft the syndics of the painters' Guild of Saint Luke were able to rescue the altarpiece by Maarten van Heemskerck, which the guild had commissioned only 15 years earlier.|$|E
25|$|Ludwik Fleck {{establishes}} scientific constructivism {{by introducing}} {{the notions of}} thought collective (Denkkollektiv), and thought style (Denkstil), through which the evolution of science is much more understandable, because the research objects {{can be described in}} terms of the assumptions (thought style) that are shared for practical but also inherently social reasons, or just because <b>any</b> <b>thought</b> collective tends to preserve itself. These notions have been drawn upon by Thomas Kuhn.|$|E

25|$|This was {{followed}} by a triangular series, played at the Antigua Recreation Ground in St. John's, Antigua, which saw Bermuda play Bangladesh and Canada. Their opening match was against Bangladesh where they posted 205/8 in their 50 overs, Lionel Cann top scoring with 33 off just 23 balls, however Bangladeshi opener Shahriar Nafees quickly silenced <b>any</b> <b>thought</b> of Bermuda pulling off a win, posting 104 not out and guiding Bangladesh home to an 8 wicket win.|$|E
25|$|Judgments are, for Kant, the {{preconditions}} of <b>any</b> <b>thought.</b> Man thinks via judgments, so {{all possible}} judgments must be listed and the perceptions connected within them put aside, {{so as to}} make it possible to examine the moments when the understanding is engaged in constructing judgments. For the categories are equivalent to these moments, in that they are concepts of intuitions in general, so far as they are determined by these moments universally and necessarily. Thus by listing all the moments, one can deduce from them all of the categories.|$|E
25|$|His {{first book}} was In the Ranks of the C.I.V., {{an account of}} his {{experiences}} in the Boer War, but he wrote it without <b>any</b> <b>thought</b> of publication: while serving with the Honourable Artillery Company in South Africa he composed many long, descriptive letters about his experiences to his two sisters, Dulcibella and Constance. They and a family friend, Elizabeth Thompson, daughter of George Smith of the publishing house Smith, Elder, edited the letters into book form. The print proofs were waiting for Childers to approve on his return {{from the war in}} October 1900 and Smith, Elder published the work in November. It was well-timed to catch the public's interest in the war, which continued until May 1902, and it sold in substantial numbers.|$|E

25|$|Marcianople fell {{immediately}} to the Huns, who destroyed it; the city then lay desolate until the Emperor Justinian restored it one hundred years later. Even worse, Constantinople, {{the capital of the}} eastern half of the Roman empire, was under the grave threat of the Huns, as its walls had been ruined during an earthquake in January 447 and its population suffered from the ensuing plague. However, the Praetorian prefect of the East Constantinus managed to repair the walls in just two months by mobilizing the city's manpower, {{with the help of the}} Circus factions. These hasty repairs, combined with the urgent transfer of a body of Isaurian soldiers into the city, and the heavy losses incurred to the Huns' army in the Battle of Utus, forced Attila to abandon <b>any</b> <b>thought</b> of besieging the capital.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1950s Don Javier firmly {{abandoned}} <b>any</b> <b>thought</b> of reconciliation with the Alfonsinos and instructed harsh measures versus those who approached them; however, he remained respectful towards Don Juan and avoided open challenge, still falling short of explicitly claiming the title. He supported Valiente – his position gradually reinforced formally {{up to new}} Jefe Delegado in 1958-1960 - in attempts to eradicate internal focos of rebellion against collaboration and to combat new openly secessionist anti-collaborative groups. Though 20 years earlier he expelled from the Comunión those who had accepted seats in the Francoist structures, {{at the turn of}} the decades Don Javier viewed the appointment of 5 Carlists to the Cortes as success of the collaborationist policy, especially that the regime permitted new Carlist legal outposts and the movement seemed visibly reinvigorated, now openly present in the public discourse.|$|E
25|$|After {{his defeat}} at the Battle of Eckmühl on 21 and 22 April 1809, Archduke Charles withdrew {{to the north}} bank of the Danube with 92,000 troops. Of these, the I Armeekorps {{numbered}} 28,000, the II counted 20,000, the III had 13,000, the IV included 15,000, the I Reserve mustered 12,000, and General-major Josef Mayer's V Armeekorps brigade had 4,000. Charles regrouped his army at Cham, which is {{just west of the}} Bohemian frontier. Convinced that his army was demoralized by its defeat, Charles gave up <b>any</b> <b>thought</b> of counterattacking Napoleon. Instead, he intended to retreat from Cham to Vienna via České Budějovice (Budweis). For his part, Napoleon made up his mind to plunge forward on the south bank toward Austria's capital, Vienna. Consequently, the French emperor called off the brief pursuit by Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout's III Corps and allowed Charles an untroubled retreat.|$|E

25|$|A {{principal}} {{source for}} the items in Illich-Svitych's dictionary was the earlier work of Alfredo Trombetti (1866–1929), an Italian linguist who had developed a classification scheme for all the world's languages, widely reviled {{at the time and}} subsequently ignored by almost all linguists. In Trombetti's time, a widely held view on classifying languages was that similarity in inflections is the surest proof of genetic relationship. In the interim, the view had taken hold that the comparative method—previously used as a means of studying languages already known to be related and without <b>any</b> <b>thought</b> of classification—is the most effective means to establish genetic relationship, eventually hardening into the conviction that it is the only legitimate means to do so. This view was basic to the outlook of the new Nostraticists. Although Illich-Svitych adopted many of Trombetti's etymologies, he sought to validate them by a systematic comparison of the sound systems of the languages concerned.|$|E
25|$|Renpō Niwa, {{a former}} abbot of Eihei-ji, divides the texts into five parts. The first {{part is the}} preface in which Dōgen {{emphasizes}} the importance of the work of the tenzo, or head cook. He asserts that the position is only suitable for experienced monks with a certain deep degree of understanding of zen practice. The next section describes the actual work the tenzo must carry out, as well as the attitude with which it should be undertaken. The third part includes instructions for serving, as well as an account of Dōgen's famous encounters with two monks serving as tenzo while he was visiting China. He acknowledges that these meetings had a deep and lasting impact on his understanding of Buddhism, and they thus ultimately helped shape Sōtō Zen in Japan. Next, Dōgen focuses on the need for the tenzo to act without <b>any</b> <b>thought</b> of discrimination or duality. In the last section, the discussion of the tenzo's attitude is concluded with a discussion of the Three Minds (Sanshin, 三心), a set of three ideals for Zen practice.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{pressure}} from his captains to sail immediately for Boston to make repairs, Admiral d'Estaing instead sailed for Newport {{to inform the}} Americans he {{would be unable to}} assist them. Upon his arrival on 20 August he informed Sullivan, and rejected entreaties that the British could be compelled to surrender in just one or two days with their help. Of the decision, d'Estaing wrote: [...] "It was [...] difficult to persuade oneself that about six thousand men well entrenched and with a fort before which they had dug trenches could be taken either in twenty-four hours or in two days". <b>Any</b> <b>thought</b> of the French fleet remaining at Newport was also opposed by d'Estaing's captains, with whom he had a difficult relationship because of his arrival in the navy at a high rank after service in the French army. D'Estaing sailed for Boston on 22 August.|$|E
500|$|Emilia Aylmer Blake wrote {{perhaps the}} first poem about Ayres, titled , which she recited at a social {{gathering}} in June 1885. Sir Francis Hastings Doyle also wrote a well-received poem in honour of Ayres, as did leading social reformer and women's rights campaigner Laura Ormiston Chant. By the late 1880s Ayres was coming {{to be seen as}} a model of British devotion to duty, and her story was told in collections of heroic and inspirational stories for children, including as the first story in F. J. Cross's influential Beneath the Banner, in which Cross remarked that: [...] "She had tried to do her best always. Her loving tenderness to the children committed to her care and her pure gentle life were remarked by those around her before there was <b>any</b> <b>thought</b> of her dying a heroic death. So, when the great trial came, she was prepared; and what seems to us Divine unselfishness appeared to her but simple duty." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{lack of an}} heir {{who could}} feasibly provide a new {{direction}} for the nation also diminished the long-term prospects for continuation of the Brazilian monarchy. The Emperor loved his daughter Isabel, and respected her strong character. However, he considered {{the idea of a}} female successor as antithetical to the role required of Brazil's ruler. [...] "Destiny had spoken in the loss of his two male heirs and the lack, after their death, of any more sons." [...] That view was also shared by the political establishment, who continued to harbor reservations when it came to <b>any</b> <b>thought</b> of accepting a female ruler. Isabel's children were also discounted as heirs. Pedro II had not raised them as possible successors to the throne, but rather in hopes that they would become worthy citizens. The consensus was that a suitable successor [...] "had to be a man", that is, a male of the Braganza line.|$|E
