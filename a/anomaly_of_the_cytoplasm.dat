40|$|Abstract—The {{automated}} {{interpretation of}} Pap smear images is a challenging issue with several aspects. <b>The</b> accurate segmenta-tion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structuring elements <b>of</b> each cell {{is a crucial}} procedure which entails in <b>the</b> correct identification <b>of</b> pathological situa-tions. However, the extended cell overlapping in Pap smear slides complicates <b>the</b> automated analysis <b>of</b> these cytological images. In this work, we propose an efficient algorithm for <b>the</b> separation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> area <b>of</b> overlapping cells. <b>The</b> proposed method {{is based on the}} fact that in isolated cells <b>the</b> pixels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> exhibit similar features and <b>the</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> area is homogeneous. Thus, <b>the</b> observation <b>of</b> intensity changes in extended subareas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> indicates <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> overlapping cells. In <b>the</b> first step <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proposed method, the image is tesselated into perceptually meaningful individual regions using a superpixel algorithm. In a second step, these areas are merged into regions exhibiting the same characteristics, resulting in <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> each <b>cytoplasm</b> area and <b>the</b> corresponding nuclei. <b>The</b> area <b>of</b> overlap is then detected using an algorithm that specifies faint changes in <b>the</b> intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> <b>of</b> each cell. <b>The</b> method has been evaluated on cytological images of conventional Pap smears, and the results are very promising.

40|$|SummaryThe {{physical}} nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bacterial <b>cytoplasm</b> is poorly understood {{even though it}} determines cytoplasmic dynamics and hence cellular physiology and behavior. Through single-particle tracking of protein filaments, plasmids, storage granules, and foreign particles of different sizes, we find that <b>the</b> bacterial <b>cytoplasm</b> displays properties that are characteristic of glass-forming liquids and changes from liquid-like to solid-like in a component size-dependent fashion. As a result, <b>the</b> motion <b>of</b> cytoplasmic components becomes disproportionally constrained with increasing size. Remarkably, cellular metabolism fluidizes <b>the</b> <b>cytoplasm,</b> allowing larger components to escape their local environment and explore larger regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cytoplasm.</b> Consequently, cytoplasmic fluidity and dynamics dramatically change as cells shift between metabolically active and dormant states in response to fluctuating environments. Our findings provide insight into bacterial dormancy and have broad implications {{to our understanding of}} bacterial physiology, as <b>the</b> glassy behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cytoplasm</b> impacts all intracellular processes involving large components...|$|R
