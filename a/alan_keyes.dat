30|$|In {{launching}} {{this new}} journal, it is timely to acknowledge distinguished {{scholars such as}} Marie Jahoda, Norman Bradburn, Angus Campbell and Ed Diener for their commitment to well-being and positive mental health research despite a climate that did not favour or readily publish studies on such topics. Their foundational work {{has been instrumental in}} understanding the factors that are associated with well-being. For example, we now have considerable insight into the role of personality and sociodemographic factors in influencing various components of well-being and we are clearer about the important constituents of psychological well-being (e.g., positive relations, purpose in life, autonomy). We have also operationalised key terms like subjective and psychological well-being, meaning, flow and strengths and have developed a range of corresponding measures. Based on the outstanding work of authors such as <b>Alan</b> Waterman, Corey <b>Keyes,</b> Felicia Huppert, Sonja Lyubomirsky, Ken Sheldon and so many others, we now know more about the various types of well-being (reflecting hedonic and eudaimonic elements) and the strategies for deliberately enhancing individual and community-level well-being. We also commend the efforts of psychologists such as Richard Davidson and Carol Ryff and their teams, who have begun to uncover neurobiological markers of well-being. The accomplishments to date have been substantial and there is promise of ongoing and even more innovative progress with the high calibre of scholars currently dedicated to well-being research, many of whom we are fortunate to have on our editorial board.|$|R

25|$|With Obama facing nearly certain {{victory in}} his U.S. Senate race against <b>Alan</b> <b>Keyes</b> {{at the time}} {{combined}} with an overwhelmingly positive reaction to his address, speculation grew {{about the possibility of}} a potential Obama candidacy for President of the United States in 2008 or later. Following the speech, Chris Mathews even went as far as predicting that Obama would become the first African-American president.|$|E

25|$|In the Presidential primary {{elections}} of February 5, 2008, Sen.

25|$|Six weeks later, the Illinois Republican State Central Committee chose former Diplomat <b>Alan</b> <b>Keyes</b> {{to replace}} Ryan as the Republican candidate. The {{election}} {{was the first}} for the U.S. Senate in which both major party candidates were African American. Obama's 43% margin of victory was {{the largest in the}} state history of U.S. Senate elections. The inequality in the candidates spending for the fall elections – $14,244,768 by Obama and $2,545,325 by Keyes – is also among the largest in history in both absolute and relative terms.|$|E
25|$|After easily {{defeating}} <b>Alan</b> <b>Keyes</b> {{to win his}} Senate {{seat and}} being sworn into office on January 4, 2005, Obama wrote The Audacity of Hope, which was released in October 2006.

On November 6, 2012, Obama was reelected to a second term as President of the United States, defeating former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney.|$|E
25|$|Coburn {{endorsed}} conservative {{activist and}} former diplomat <b>Alan</b> <b>Keyes</b> in the 2000 Republican presidential primaries. Coburn retired from Congress in 2001, fulfilling his pledge to serve {{no more than}} three terms in the House. His congressional district returned to the Democratic fold, as attorney Brad Carson defeated a Republican endorsed by Coburn. After leaving the House and returning to private medical practice, Coburn wrote Breach of Trust, with ghostwriter John Hart, about his experiences in Congress. The book detailed Coburn's perspective on the internal Republican Party debates over the Contract With America and displayed his disdain for career politicians. Some of the figures he criticized (such as Gingrich) were already out of office {{at the time of the}} book's publishing, but others (such as former House Speaker Dennis Hastert) remained influential in Congress, which resulted in speculation that some congressional Republicans wanted no part of Coburn's return to politics.|$|E
25|$|Irving Kristol and Leo Strauss were {{founders of}} the movement. The {{magazines}} Commentary and Public Interest were their key outlets, as well as op-ed articles for major newspapers and position papers for think tanks. Activists around Democratic senator Henry Jackson became deeply involved as well. Prominent spokesmen include Gertrude Himmelfarb, Bill Kristol, Paul Wolfowitz, Lewis Libby, Norman Podhoretz, Richard Pipes, David Horowitz, Charles Krauthammer, Richard Perle, Robert Kagan, Elliott Abrams and Ben Wattenberg. Meanwhile, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan was highly sympathetic but remained a Democrat. Some of Strauss' influential neoconservative disciples included Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, Paul Wolfowitz (who became Deputy Secretary of Defense), <b>Alan</b> <b>Keyes</b> (who became Assistant Secretary of State), William Bennett (who became Secretary of Education), Weekly Standard editor William Kristol, political philosopher Allan Bloom, writer John Podhoretz, college president John Agresto, political scientist Harry V. Jaffa and novelist Saul Bellow.|$|E
25|$|With Vice President Dick Cheney {{choosing}} not to {{seek the}} nomination and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice ruling herself out, {{the race for the}} 2008 presidential nomination was wide open. It officially began in March 2006 when John H. Cox became the first candidate to enter the 2008 race. The Democratic takeover of both houses of Congress and President Bush's unpopularity were strong issues for the GOP field. At the beginning of 2007, the announced Republican field was former Governor of Wisconsin and Cabinet member Tommy Thompson, former Governor of Virginia Jim Gilmore, and Senator of Kansas Sam Brownback. Former senator of Virginia George Allen was considered a top contender until his loss in the midterm elections. He announced on December 10, 2006 that he would not seek the 2008 nomination. In early January former Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney announced he was forming an exploratory committee. Afterwards several others announced they were running, including U.S.Congressman Ron Paul, Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, Rudy Giuliani of New York City, U.S. Senator John McCain, U.S. Congressman Duncan Hunter, and U.S. Congressman Tom Tancredo. A poll released in early February had Giuliani leading with 32% and John McCain second with 18%. By early March, Giuliani had become the frontrunner. <b>Alan</b> <b>Keyes</b> and former Senator and actor Fred Thompson entered the race later in September.|$|E
25|$|Obama, {{having a}} Caucasian mother and Kenyan {{father of the}} Luo ethnic group, became the first African American {{as well as the}} first bi-racial {{president}}. Although he may have been the first black president to win an election, Obama was not the first African American to run for president. Shirley Chisolm, Jesse Jackson, Lenora Fulani, Carol Moseley Braun, <b>Alan</b> <b>Keyes,</b> and Al Sharpton all at some point were in the process for presidential nomination. The Obama-Biden ticket was also the first winning ticket in American history on which neither candidate was a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant; Biden is Roman Catholic and is the first Roman Catholic to be elected Vice President; all other tickets with Catholic vice presidential candidates had been defeated (1964, 1972, 1984). Obama and Biden were the first President and Vice President elected from the Senate since 1960 (John F. Kennedy/Lyndon B. Johnson) (in the previous election cycle (2004) Democrats also nominated two sitting Senators, John Kerry of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina, but they lost to incumbents Bush and Cheney), Obama became the first Northern Democratic president since Kennedy, and the Obama-Biden ticket was the first winning Democratic ticket to feature two Northerners since 1940 (Franklin D. Roosevelt/Henry A. Wallace). Also, Obama became the first Democratic candidate to win a majority of the popular vote since Jimmy Carter in 1976, the first to win a majority of both votes and states since Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and the first Northern Democrat to win a majority of both votes and states since Franklin Roosevelt in 1944. This was the first presidential election since 1952 in which neither of the major party candidates was either the incumbent President or Vice-President.|$|E
500|$|Fuck {{begins with}} a segment from the 1965 {{propaganda}} film Perversion for Profit, followed by a clip from SpongeBob SquarePants which states that the word {{can be used as}} a [...] "sentence enhancer".

500|$|Baldwin {{announced}} on April 10, 2008 {{that he would}} seek the Constitution Party presidential nomination at the party's April 23–26 convention in Kansas City, Missouri. [...] His run was believed to have arisen from draft efforts within the Constitution Party, who feared the party would nominate a pro-Iraq War candidate like <b>Alan</b> <b>Keyes.</b> [...] Until the convention, Baldwin did not campaign and in an April 17 interview with Miller Politics, he stated that he was [...] "not running" [...] but merely placing his name into consideration, [...] "trusting that God will reveal His will accordingly." ...|$|E
500|$|The Chuck Baldwin presidential {{campaign}} of 2008 began April 10, 2008 as pastor and radio host Chuck Baldwin of Florida announced his candidacy for the Constitution Party presidential nomination. [...] He previously {{served as the}} party's vice-presidential nominee in 2004. Baldwin's main opposition for the nomination was former ambassador <b>Alan</b> <b>Keyes,</b> who had just left the Republican Party. After a campaign touting his stands on civil liberties, foreign affairs, and religion, Baldwin won the nomination at the April 26 Constitution Party National Convention. Attorney Darrell Castle was selected as his running mate.|$|E
500|$|Bush avoided {{most of the}} {{scheduled}} Republican Party debates during 1999, including one held on November 21 at Arizona State University in McCain's home state. [...] There McCain debated second-tier candidates <b>Alan</b> <b>Keyes,</b> Orrin Hatch, and Steve Forbes instead. [...] Bush finally did participate in the December6 debate from the Orpheum Theatre in Phoenix, by which time McCain was so busy campaigning in New Hampshire {{that he had to}} join via a video linkup. [...] There McCain's signature push for campaign finance reform led to one of the few lively exchanges in an otherwise placid event.|$|E
500|$|During a March 25, 2008 {{interview}} with Miller Politics, {{two weeks before}} Baldwin officially entered the race, he commended <b>Alan</b> <b>Keyes</b> as a possible Constitution Party candidate but stated that he [...] "needs to clarify his foreign policy positions for the party." [...] He described Libertarian Party candidate Bob Barr as a [...] "very attractive candidate" [...] whom he [...] "like...very much." [...] When asked about his own presidential aspirations, he responded by saying that [...] "There are many great people in our party that, in my opinion, are much more qualified [...] than I am. I have always tried {{to be open to}} God's will. At this time, however, I have no inclination that this is God's will for me." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 5, 2007, We Need <b>Alan</b> <b>Keyes</b> for President {{was formed}} as a {{political}} action committee to encourage Keyes to enter the 2008 presidential election. On September 14, 2007, Keyes officially announced his candidacy {{in an interview with}} radio show host Janet Parshall. On September 17, 2007, Keyes participated in the Values Voter Debate streamed live on Sky Angel, the Values Voter website, and radio. In a straw poll of the attending audience, Keyes placed third among the invited candidates, after Mike Huckabee and Ron Paul. Keyes was excluded from the Republican CNN/YouTube debate on November 28, 2007. Keyes's campaign called the exclusion [...] "arbitrary, unfair, and presumptuous," [...] arguing that CNN was playing the role of [...] "gatekeeper" [...] for the presidential election.|$|E
500|$|While {{considering}} {{a run for}} president, during an October 2006 interview with The Conservative President 2008 website, Baldwin expressed his frustration with the Republican Party, which he believed was on a course of [...] "self-destruction" [...] and that was only kept afloat by the [...] "absurd liberalism of Democrats." [...] He praised Congressmen Tom Tancredo and Ron Paul as well as activists Pat Buchanan and [...] <b>Alan</b> <b>Keyes,</b> but stated that the Republican Party had steered {{too far to the}} left for him to support any of their candidates for president. When asked if he would run for president in 2008 he stated that he had [...] "no desire to run" [...] but that he was [...] "always open to God's will." [...] Baldwin endorsed Ron Paul for the Republican presidential nomination in a message posted to YouTube on December 19, 2007.|$|E
500|$|During the trip, Borat acquires a Baywatch booklet at a {{yard sale}} and {{continues}} gathering footage for his documentary. He meets gay pride parade participants, politicians <b>Alan</b> <b>Keyes</b> and Bob Barr, and African American youths. Borat is also interviewed on live television and disrupts the weather report. Visiting a rodeo, Borat excites the crowd with jingoistic American remarks, but then sings a fictional Kazakhstani national anthem {{to the tune of}} [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner", receiving a strong negative reaction. Staying at a bed-and-breakfast, Borat and Azamat are stunned to learn their hosts are Jewish. Fearful at the hands of their hosts, the two escape after throwing money at two woodlice, believing they are their Jewish hosts transformed. Borat attempts to buy a handgun to defend himself, but is turned away because he is not an American citizen; consequentially, Borat purchases a bear for protection.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, he {{hosted a}} live {{television}} commentary show, <b>Alan</b> <b>Keyes</b> Is Making Sense, on the MSNBC cable news channel. The network canceled {{the show in}} July, citing poor ratings. The cancellation triggered a currently ongoing boycott led by Jewish education website Mesora.org whose reach numbers more than 72,000 email subscribers. The show was unsympathetic to supporters of the al-Aqsa Intifadah—whom Keyes frequently debated on the program—and supported the Israeli crackdown on Palestinians. The show also featured critical discussion of homosexuality and of priests accused in the Catholic Church sex abuse scandals. The last episode was broadcast on June 27, 2002. As a result of Keyes's strong advocacy of Israel on his MSNBC show, in July 2002 the state of Israel awarded him a special honor [...] "in appreciation of his journalistic endeavors and his integrity in reporting" [...] and flew him in to meet Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.|$|E
500|$|In August, Barr {{spoke at}} the Minuteman Civil Defense Corps' protest during the Democratic National Convention in Denver. Approximately a dozen {{individuals}} were in attendance at the event. Former Republican candidates Tom Tancredo and <b>Alan</b> <b>Keyes</b> also attended the event, which organizers called a success. Barr presented a [...] "common sense" [...] approach to the issue by promising {{to put an end}} to birthright citizenship and public education for illegal immigrants, while supporting an increase in green cards. Claremont McKenna College professor John Pitney argued that the candidate was sending mixed messages since [...] "the Libertarian Party essentially supports open borders," [...] and was unlikely to gain the support of anti-immigration activists. A Zogby poll released on August 15, 2008 indicated that most Republicans and Democrats wanted Barr included in the presidential debates. The poll also indicated that nearly 70% of independent voters would have liked to see him included.|$|E
500|$|On August 8, 2004—with 86days to {{go before}} the general election—the Illinois Republican Party drafted <b>Alan</b> <b>Keyes</b> to run against Democratic state senator Barack Obama for the U.S. Senate, after the Republican nominee, Jack Ryan, withdrew due to a sex scandal, and other {{potential}} draftees (most notably former Illinois governor Jim Edgar and former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka) declined to run. The Washington Post called Keyes a [...] "carpetbagger" [...] since he [...] "had never lived in Illinois." [...] When asked to answer charges of carpetbagging in the context of his earlier criticism of Hillary Clinton, he called her campaign [...] "pure and planned selfish ambition", but stated that in his case he felt a moral obligation to run after being asked to by the Illinois Republican Party. [...] "You are doing what you believe to be required by your respect for God's will, and I think that that's what I'm doing in Illinois".|$|E
