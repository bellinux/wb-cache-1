40|$|Systems, {{methods and}} {{apparatus}} are provided through {{which in some}} implementations determine the amplitude of an <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulated</b> signal, modulated by the position of an object being sensed. In some aspects, the apparatus accepts an excitation signal and the <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulated</b> signal and divides the <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulated</b> by the excitation signal to produce an output signal that {{is proportional to the}} position of the object being sensed. In other aspects, the division is performed only when the excitation signal is non-zero, such as close to the peaks in the excitation signal. In other aspects, the excitation signal and <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulated</b> signal are degraded due to an air gap and the degraded signals are used to correct for amplitude fluctuations due to the air gap, and produce an output signal, tolerant of the air gaps, that is proportional to the position of the object being sensed...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 In recent years, studies {{indicate}} that the second formant of normal speech contains {{the majority of the}} information necessary for speech intelligibility. This thesis presents a system to translate the second formant frequencies to within a more adequate hearing range of the partially deaf. The digital speech translator, DISTRAN, utilizes pulse amplitude modulation of an input audio signal. The pulse <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulated</b> signal is gated into a series of storage circuits in synchronism with a first digital signal whose frequency constitutes the desired sample rate. The contents of the storage circuits are then sequentially read out at a second, altered frequency so as to construct a second pulse <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulated</b> signal whose basic frequency is altered from that of the first. Redundant segments of speech are discarded or added so that the time interval of the processed speech is that of the original. The second pulse <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulated</b> signal is then demodulated, which converts the second pulse <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulated</b> signal into an output audio signal, altered in frequency from the input...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of the displacement {{of the position of}} the pressure, intensity and acoustic radiation force maxima along the axis of focused acoustic beams under increasing driving amplitudes (nonlinear focal shift) is studied for the case of a moderately focused beam excited with continuous and 25 kHz <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulated</b> signals, both in water and tissue. We prove that in <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulated</b> beams the linear and nonlinear propagation effects coexist in a semi-period of modulation, giving place to a complex dynamic behaviour, where the singular points of the beam (peak pressure, rarefaction, intensity and acoustic radiation force) locate at different points on axis as a function of time. These entire phenomena are explained in terms of harmonic generation and absorption during the propagation in a lossy nonlinear medium both, for a continuous and an <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulated</b> beam. One of the possible applications of the acoustic radiation force displacement is the generation of shear waves at different locations by using a focused mono-element transducer excited with an <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulated</b> signal...|$|R

50|$|Like all {{modulation}} schemes, QAM conveys data {{by changing}} {{some aspect of}} a carrier signal, or the carrier wave, (usually a sinusoid) {{in response to a}} data signal. In the case of QAM, the amplitude of two waves of the same frequency, 90° out-of-phase with each other (in quadrature) are changed (modulated or keyed) to represent the data signal. <b>Amplitude</b> <b>modulating</b> two carriers in quadrature can be equivalently viewed as both <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulating</b> and phase modulating a single carrier.|$|R

50|$|If the {{stimulus}} used is not abrupt but periodic then ongoing ITDs are measured. This {{is where the}} waveforms reaching both ears can be shifted in time until they perfectly match up {{and the size of}} this shift is recorded as the ITD.

50|$|The VOR encodes azimuth (direction {{from the}} station) as the phase {{relationship}} between a reference signal and a variable signal. The omnidirectional signal contains a modulated continuous wave (MCW) 7 wpm Morse code station identifier, and usually contains an <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulated</b> (AM) voice channel. The conventional 30 Hz reference signal is frequency modulated (FM) on a 9,960 Hz subcarrier. The variable <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulated</b> (AM) signal is conventionally derived from the lighthouse-like rotation of a directional antenna array 30 times per second. Although older antennas were mechanically rotated, current installations scan electronically to achieve an equivalent result with no moving parts. This is achieved by a circular array of typically 60 directional antennas, the signal to each one being <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulated</b> by the 30 Hz reference signal delayed in phase to match the azimuthal position of each individual antenna. When the composite signal is received in the aircraft, the AM and FM 30 Hz components are detected and then compared to determine the phase angle between them.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Lamb modes {{exhibit a}} {{resonant}} behavior at frequencies where the group velocity vanishes while the phase velocity remains finite. This type of zero group velocity (ZGV) point exists in most isotropic materials at the minimum frequency-thickness {{product of the}} first order symmetric (S 1) Lamb mode. Laser sources couple efficiently into this resonance and a sharp peak is observed with source and receiver on epicentre. A model for the laser generation of ultrasound in thin plates using an <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulated</b> laser source is presented. Lamb wave displacement spectra are measured using an <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulated</b> laser source for excitation and a Michelson interferometer coupled to an RF lockin amplifier for detection. The displacement spectra of Lamb waves generated in micron scale plates show good agreement with theoretical predictions. Experimental results are presented demonstrating excitation of the S 1 ZGV resonance in a 4 μm thick membrane using a high frequency (700 MHz) <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulated</b> laser source.

Different competitive learning algorithms for the RBF-NN centres determination are discussed. A new competitive learning algorithm is introduced, the rival penalized competitive learning, which rewards the winner and penalizes its first rival. The results of simulations performed in different conditions, are presented showing that the performance of the RBF-NN equalizer, which is based on this new algorithm, is better if compared with other competitive algorithms.

40|$|Time-of-flight {{range imaging}} systems {{utilizing}} the <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulated</b> continuous wave (AMCW) technique often suffer from measurement nonlinearity {{due to the}} presence of aliased harmonics within the amplitude modulation signals. Typically a calibration is performed to correct these errors. We demonstrate an alternative phase encoding approach that attenuates the harmonics during the sampling process, thereby improving measurement linearity in the raw measurements. This mitigates the need to measure the system’s response or calibrate for environmental changes. In conjunction with improved linearity, we demonstrate that measurement precision can also be increased by reducing the duty cycle of the <b>amplitude</b> <b>modulated</b> illumination source (while maintaining overall illumination power) ...|$|R
