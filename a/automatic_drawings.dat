40|$|The <b>automatic</b> {{generation}} of <b>drawings</b> of metabolic pathways is a challenging problem that depends intimately on exactly what {{information has been}} recorded for each pathway, and on how that information is encoded. The chief contributions of the paper are a minimized representation for biochemical pathways called the predecessor list, and inference procedures for converting the predecessor list into a pathway-graph representation that can serve as input to a pathway-drawing algorithm. The predecessor list has several advantages over the pathway graph, including its compactness and its lack of redundancy. The conversion between the two representations can be formulated as both a constraintsatisfaction problem and a logical inference problem, whose goal is to assign directions to reactions, and to determine which are the main chemical compounds in the reaction. We describe a set of production rules that solves this inference problem. We also present heuristics for inferring whether the exte [...] ...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: This study aims at {{evaluating}} two automatic {{contour detection}} techniques especially developed for dermoscopic images. METHODS: Twenty-five images of lesions with a fuzzy boundary have been randomly selected. Five dermatologists experienced in dermoscopy have manually drawn {{the border of}} all the lesions and repeated the procedure after two and four weeks. The ability of a dermatologist to reproduce its own results was evaluated by measuring the non-overlapping area enclosed by its three successive contours. The interobserver variability evaluated the contour accuracy when using <b>automatic</b> or manual <b>drawings.</b> The mean probability that a pixel has been misclassified was computed for every observer and automatic technique. RESULTS: Experts in dermoscopy {{are not able to}} reproduce measurements precisely and the two automatic techniques had a lower misclassification probability than those obtained by each dermatologist. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a single dermatologist should not be used as a reference, and subjective validation of lesion contour is inaccurate outside an experts's group. It is argued that image processing techniques for computer-aided diagnosis must show the best compromise within such a group...|$|R

This is perhaps a more pure form of automatic drawing since it can be almost entirely involuntary - to develop a representational form requires the conscious mind to take over the process of drawing, unless it is entirely accidental and thus incidental.

He works to ensure they do not resemble the original piece, that he opens himself to randomness, chance, the subconscious, where new layers of meaning emerge. Transforming one panel at a time, individual sections become both contained compositions and elements of a larger one. Once complete, he titles the piece based on thematic threads, or patterns, that have revealed themselves in the process. This interplay between structure and flow state, of finding resolution in shape, form, and thought, are a hallmark of Horner’s practice and body of work.|$|E

Spare would self-publish it in an edition of 100 copies from his sister's house in Goodmayes, Essex, in 1927. That year he also produced a series of six pictures, each depicting a female head in a different pose, which biographer Phil Baker thought were particularly good; Baker remarked that, during the late 1920s, Spare was actually producing [...] "some of his finest drawing", reminiscent in many respects of the work of the Pre-Raphaelites.|$|E

40|$|Small Screens and Large Graphs: Area-Efficient Drawings of Planar Combinatorial Structures Fabrizio Frati Dipartimento di Informatica e Automazione - Roma Tre University Abstract Graphs are {{the most}} widely used data {{structures}} to represent relationships among objects. Maps, networks, circuits, molecules, compounds are a few examples of structures that are commonly represented by graphs. The clearest way to express the information conveyed in a graph is to visualize it. Namely, a drawing of a graph represents each object (in the graph terminology: vertex) of the graph as a point in the plane and each relationship (in the graph terminology: edge) between two objects as a line connecting the corresponding points. However, not every drawing can be regarded as a good representation of the graph. In fact, a drawing should be readable, that is, the human eye should be able to easily identify the relationships among the objects in the graph at the first glance to the drawing. Clearly, this is not a formal definition of what differentiates a good drawing from a bad drawing. However, a few topological and geometric features have been recognized and accepted as the criteria a drawing should satisfy in order to be readable. Planarity is probably the best characteristic a drawing can have. The absence of intersections between the edges of the graph allows a viewer to easily distinguish the line representing any edge and hence to immediately understand which are the vertices connected by the edge. From a geometric perspective, it would be preferable that edges are drawn as straight-lines, namely edges bending and repeatedly changing direction are detrimental for the readability of the drawing. When the straight-line requirement can not be met, it would be still desiderable to have edges drawn as poly-lines bending {{only a limited number of}} times. When the size of the graph to be represented is too large in order for the drawing to be constructed manually, there is a need for an algorithm automatically constructing such a drawing. Graph Drawing deals with the design of algorithms to automatically construct drawings of graphs. Usually a Graph Drawing algorithm takes as an input a graph, a set of requirements the drawing must satisfy (as being planar or having straight-line edges), and a set of aesthetics the drawing should satisfy as much as possible. The most important aesthetic a drawing should satisfy is probably the one of having a small area. In fact, <b>automatic</b> <b>drawings</b> usually have to be displayed on a computer screen of bounded size, hence they have to fit in the space available on the screen. The study of graph drawings in small area has been first motivated by the design of VLSI circuits and has attracted intense research efforts for almost thirty years now. In this thesis we deal with algorithms and bounds for drawing graphs in small area. We mainly deal with planar graphs (Part I of the thesis), series-parallel graphs and outerplanar graphs (Part II), trees (Part III), and clustered graphs (Part IV), and for each of these graph classes we consider the problem of obtaining drawings in small area under a large number of drawing conventions (e. g., straight-line, poly-line, orthogonal, upward). We design several algorithms for the construction of graph drawings in small area and we obtain lower bounds for the area requirements of several drawing styles. The graph classes and the drawing conventions we consider are among the most commonly used for applications. Nevertheless, the beauty of some combinatorial, topological, and geometric problems concerning the construction of graph drawings in small area justifies their study even when looking at them from a purely theoretical point of view. ...|$|E
40|$|Words as I {{have known}} them are {{evolving}} concepts {{in the landscape}} of human language, where the meanings of words are interwoven with layers of history and culture. The boundaries of language are defined by words, and around the edges are instinctive sounds that precede and exceed meaning. These sounds are an interrupting force that unsettles the linguistic structure. We often use them for expression {{in the form of}} sobs, grunts, moans, murmurs, chants, obscenities and exclamations. They appear in times of spontaneous emotion that words cannot convey. They can also be used purposely, poetically, “…to shatter [one’s] judging consciousness in order to grant passage through it to this rhythmic drive…and, once filtered by language and its meaning, experienced as jouissance. 2 ̆ 2 I think of jouissance as a subversively sensual, mental, emotional, physical experience that disrupts consciousness. It flows in waves, like sound. It carries one beyond meaning to a bodily experience that cannot be contained by words. For codified language holds constructed ideologies, and we use it to describe ourselves to one another – to construct an identity. Language becomes flat, rigid and predictable when it stays within the boundaries of established ideologies. Therefore, it is vital to keep it alive by allowing it to be unsettled, to allow room for meaning to change. I explore this concept of disruption through journals that transform into drawings evoking rhythmic sound, natural forms and decorative motifs. I begin with words dissolving into matter in pages of personal journals. The paper is tattered through the process of writing with flammable liquids and then stitching the fragments together. As words fall away, lines of thread and color take their place. The threads consume the paper and ash, and it becomes a new material. The fibers of text dissolve, or they are trapped in the layers of thread, and they become palimpsests containing the history of what they were within the actuality of what they are. This physical history is embedded in the fibers, replacing the symbolic meaning of words with a material otherness. The repetitive lines of thread form a new structure containing linear drawings. Now, the line of thought is visible as one image. The drawings were etched and printed on silk, and they reference the thread lines that emerge from the ashes of the pages. A single line loops in and around itself in a cyclical path that begins at one point and accretes layers of repetitive spirals and spikes. The line is driven by a rhythmic sense of disorder, unbalance, and asymmetry. As expressive energy, the lines resemble plants, birds, insects and fossils, although they are not any of these things. The organic forms reflect the inherent principles of design that govern natural growth, including ourselves: “We spin into life in the womb as a spiral embryo. We are conscious energy systems that whirl into configuration as other natural energies do along spiral lines of force, unfurling into life along an endless path of spiral transformation. ” 2 There is a tension between order and disorder, creation and destruction in how the material shifts from woven to unraveling matter. The process of making these drawings is a meditative one. I use a library of spiraling gestures in both deliberate and spontaneous formats. I react to intuition by intentionally drawing in one mode, but I also impulsively interrupt the designs by changing the rhythm or direction of the line. It is a dance between the hand and mind guided by inner sounds or vibrations; an emotive stream of consciousness manifest in a physical format. This process of drawing is analogous to the journaling from which it stems, for both practices make space for interior dialogue. It is a dialogue with the influences in my life. I see the influence of nature and music, as well as the decorative patterns and methods of sewing that I inherit from my mother. Some of my earliest memories are of sewing cross-stitch with her. She would push the needle in and I would pull it through. This physical interaction between us made an image on the fabric. It was a conversation between two hands. I return to that conversation, and of finding a feminine perspective by sewing away the fragments of paper to construct a material of line and thread. There is a long tradition in art history of turning inward for wordless expression. Wassily Kandinsky emphasized music in his non-objective art, the Abstract Expressionists sought interior psychological truths, and Surrealists employed <b>automatic</b> <b>drawings</b> to unveil the inner psyche. I want to link this idea to the thought of the body as a source of knowing – of “embodied knowledge,” as artist Ann Hamilton explains it. I also feel that many unnamed individuals draw from this inner source through “mere” decoration – I think of the women in India who daily paint patterns outside their homes in the earth as ephemeral rituals of time passed from day to day, as well as to mark milestones like birth, adolescence and marriage. They reflect the passage of time, decay and regeneration, and the perpetual cycles of these processes. There is an undercurrent of wordless energy that I try to know in the physical, bodily sense of knowing, and I try to convey that energy through a sensory experience. I hope for the viewer to find his or her own introspection within this work, perhaps a wave of jouissance. Advisor: Karen Kun...|$|E
