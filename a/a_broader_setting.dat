Its use of groups of experts ensures a number of opinions worth considering when calculating probabilities of events. The level of mathematics in calculating probabilities ensures that the results are as accurate as a researcher can make them. In addition, when used on consort with other analytic techniques, this type of cross-impact analysiscan give greater quantitative results to an otherwise qualitative analysis. The relative conformity of methods ensures that analysts using different methods or simulations can come to similar results, making the results testable in <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> <b>setting.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{certain types}} of discretization schemes for differ-ential equations with quadratic nonlinearities, which were introduced by Kahan, and considered in <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> <b>setting</b> by Mickens. These methods have the property that they preserve important structural features of the original systems, such as the behaviour of solutions near to fixed points, and also, where appropriate (e. g. for certain mechanical systems), the property of being volume-preserving, or preserving a symplectic/Poisson structure. Here {{we focus on the}} application of Kahan’s method to models of biological systems, in particular to reaction kinetics governed by the Law of Mass Action, and present a general approach to birational dis-cretization, which is applied to population dynamics of Lotka-Volterra type. ...|$|E

40|$|Following {{an insight}} of Kontsevich, we {{prove that the}} {{quotient}} of Voevodsky's category of geometric mixed motives DM by the endofunctor -Q(1) [2] embeds fully-faithfully into Kontsevich's category of noncommutative mixed motives KMM.

As an application, we obtain a precise relation between the Picard groups Pic(-), the Grothendieck groups, the Schur-finitenss, and the Kimura-finitenss of the categories DM and KMM. In particular, the quotient of Pic(DM) by the subgroup of Tate twists Q(i) [2 i] injects into Pic(KMM). Along the way, we relate KMM with Morel-Voevodsky's stable A 1 -homotopy category, recover the twisted algebraic K-theory of Kahn-Levine from KMM, and extend Elmendorf-Mandell's foundational work on multicategories to <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> <b>setting.</b> Comment: This paper has been withdrawn for further analysi...|$|E
