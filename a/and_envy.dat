During his exile in Figeac, Champollion spent his time revising the grammar and doing local archeological work, being for a time cut off from being able to continue his research.|$|E
5|$|The conquistadors {{were all}} volunteers, the {{majority}} of whom did not receive a fixed salary but instead {{a portion of the}} spoils of victory, in the form of precious metals, land grants and provision of native labour. Many of the Spanish were already experienced soldiers who had previously campaigned in Europe. A sizeable portion of the Spanish conquistadors were from the southwestern regions of Spain, with their origins in Andalusia and Extremadura. Up to 1519, according to licenses issued in Spain, over half were from these two regions. From 1520 to 1539, this fell to just under half of all conquistadors leaving Spain. The conquest of the Central American isthmus was launched from three directions; Mexico, Panama, and the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. Relations between rival conquistadors were dominated by mutual distrust, greed, <b>and</b> <b>envy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alphonse {{is guided}} by the homunculus Wrath to the {{underground}} city beneath Amestris' Central City to reopen the Gate of Alchemy. There, they are attacked by the homunculus Gluttony, who fights and mortally wounds Wrath. At Wrath's insistence, Alphonse transmutes and sacrifices the two homunculi to use as material to open the Gate. Meanwhile, in Munich, the Thule Society persuades Noah into guiding them on how to correctly open the Gate based on what she had learned from reading Edward's mind. Edward learns from Lang that the Thule Society {{plans to use the}} weapons from his world to help Adolf Hitler in his attempt to start a revolution, and heads to stop them. Hohenheim <b>and</b> <b>Envy</b> are both transmuted {{at the same time that}} Alphonse transmutes Gluttony and Wrath. With the Gate opened, Eckhart leads a fleet into the other world, where she gains the ability to use alchemy. However, she begins to go mad with power and fear of her new surroundings and launches an attack on Central City. Alfons launches Edward in a rocket-powered plane to return him to his world before being gunned down.|$|E

5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{is given}} Michael's client list as a going-away present, {{much to the}} shock <b>and</b> <b>envy</b> of the other salesmen, and after losing one, {{requests}} the help of Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) to retain them. Vickers nearly ruins {{a relationship with a}} client but Andy gains enough confidence to salvage the sale. Along the way, Vickers reveals that he was not hired for his business experience, but because he helped prevent the theft of one of Sabre CEO Jo Bennett's dogs. Meanwhile, Dwight (Rainn Wilson) is antagonistic towards Michael, still bitter over Michael not recommending him for a manager position, despite Michael's attempts to reconcile. He initially expresses disdain for Michael's going-away present, a recommendation letter, but appears touched as he reads further. He also discovers a card challenging him to a paintball match, and the two play behind the building.|$|E
5|$|To English-speaking audiences, Mühe was {{probably}} {{best known for}} portraying Hauptmann (Captain) Gerd Wiesler in Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's Das Leben der Anderen (The Lives of Others, 2006), which won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2007. The film {{is set in the}} mid-1980s, and Wiesler is a Stasi agent who is assigned to bug and conduct surveillance of the apartment of an East German playwright, Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), and his girlfriend, the actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). However, he becomes disillusioned about the necessity of monitoring the couple for national security reasons after discovering that the government minister who ordered the surveillance did so for sexual rather than political motives. Gradually, Wiesler's heart moves from contempt <b>and</b> <b>envy</b> to compassion. For his performance, in 2006 Mühe received, among other things, the Beste darstellerische Leistung – Männliche Hauptrolle (Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role), Gold, at Germany's most prestigious film awards, the Deutscher Filmpreis (German Film Awards); and the Best Actor Award at the European Film Awards.|$|E

25|$|Cupid and Psyche {{has been}} {{analyzed}} from a feminist perspective as a paradigm {{of how the}} gender unity of women is disintegrated through rivalry <b>and</b> <b>envy,</b> replacing the bonds of sisterhood with an ideal of heterosexual love.

25|$|Guatemala is {{probably}} the country where Gómez Carrillo is least known, and where the few that do know about his work, are those who criticize it the most. Official cultura curriculum has ignored him, neglecting both his persona and his work. Luis Cardoza y Aragón, the spiritual guide of the Guatemalan leftists, has been the direct culprit of this; in both of his memoirs -which have become actual bibles for his followers- Cardoza y Aragón wrote complete chapters about Gómez Carrillo where he attacks the writer mercilessly. Cardozas criticism, howewer, cannot completely hide his resentment <b>and</b> <b>envy</b> toward the writer who visited him in Paris in his youth, and to whom he dedicated his very first poems book.|$|E
25|$|Father Time, a Saturn-like image, is a {{reminder}} of the tragedy of death and loss, yet the next sunrise comes, bringing with it hope of a new day. In the first cycle of creation, evil is external (the devil). In the second cycle, we see the beginnings of family hatred, bad behavior, and evil permeating human nature. Shāh Fereydūn's two eldest sons feel greed <b>and</b> <b>envy</b> toward their innocent younger brother and, thinking their father favors him, they murder him. The murdered prince's son avenges the murder, and all are immersed in the cycle of murder and revenge, blood and more blood. In the third cycle, we encounter a series of flawed shahs. There is a Phaedra-like story of Shāh Kay Kāvus, his wife Sūdābeh, and her passion for and rejection by her stepson, Sīyāvash.|$|E
25|$|In 1498 the 40-year-old Jakob Fugger married Sybille Arzt (also: Artzt) Grand Burgheress of Augsburg, the 18-year-old {{daughter}} of an eminent Augsburg Grand Burgher. This marriage opened the opportunity for Jakob to elevate to Grand Burgher of Augsburg (German Großbürger zu Augsburg) and later finally giving Jakob Fugger the long-awaited aspiration of {{a seat on the}} city council (German Stadtrat) of Augsburg. Four years after the wedding, Jakob Fugger bought for his young wife 40.000 guilders worth of jewels from the treasure of Burgundy. Jakob wanted to demonstrate that he is after all equal to the Habsburgs, at least financially. However the jewels were left in a chest in the basement of his house for fear of theft <b>and</b> <b>envy.</b> The couple had no children. Seven weeks after her husband died Sybille Arzt married a business partner of Jakob and converted to the Protestant faith.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{after the}} {{catastrophe}} of 1391 the Jews began again {{to settle on}} the island, and on Jan. 21, 1393, the governor issued an edict for their protection, providing that a citizen who should injure a Jew should be hanged, and that a knight for the same offense should be subjected to the strappado. The advantageous position of the islands, the tradingpoint midway between Catalonia, Provence, and Sicily, attracted thither many of the Jews of Provence and Sicily, besides some from Tunis, Algiers, and other African cities. In the height of their prosperity there were in Majorca {{more than a thousand}} Jewish families. Among those who settled {{there were a number of}} people of treacherous character, who acted as informers against their fellow-Jews, and, through malice <b>and</b> <b>envy</b> or to extort money, bore false witness against men of blameless reputation, until, at the request of the community, they were expelled from the island.|$|E
25|$|Women {{participating}} in polygynous marriages share common marital problems {{with women in}} a monogamous marriage; however, there are issues uniquely related to polygyny which affects their overall life satisfaction and have severe implications for women's health. Women practicing polygyny are susceptible to sexually transmitted diseases, infertility, and mental health complications. Among the Logoli of Kenya, the fear of AIDS or becoming infected with the HIV virus has informed women's decisions about entering polygynous marriages. Some view polygyny {{as a means to}} prevent men from taking random sexual partners and potentially introducing STDs into relationships. Interviews conducted with some of the Logoli tribe in Kenya suggested they feared polygynous marriages because of what they have witnessed in the lives of other women who are currently in such relationships. The observed experiences of some of the women in polygynous unions tend to be characterized by frequent jealousy, conflicts, competition, tensions, and psychological stresses. Some of the husbands fail to share love and other resources equally; <b>and</b> <b>envy</b> and hatred, and sometimes violent physical confrontations become {{the order of the day}} among co-wives and their children. This discourages women from entering a polygynous marriage. Research shows that competition and conflict can intensify to unbearable level for co- wives causing women to commit suicide due to psychological distress. Findings show that the wife order can affect life satisfaction. According to Bove and Valeggia, women who are senior wives often misuse their position to obtain healthcare benefits in countries one wife can become a recipient. The conflict between co-wives can attribute to the higher rates of mental health disorders such as anxiety, depression, and paranoia.|$|E
