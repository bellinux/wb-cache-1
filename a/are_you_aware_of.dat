2500|$|On Monday, July 16, 1973, {{during the}} {{televised}} hearings, Thompson publicly asked: [...] "Mr. Butterfield, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> {{the installation of}} any listening devices in the Oval Office of the president?" [...] The revelation of cover-up on the taping system in the Oval Office led the House Judiciary Committee to submit three articles of impeachment for obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and contempt of congress. When the final article was approved July 30, 1974, Richard Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974.|$|E

2500|$|Three {{days after}} Sanders's discovery, at a public, {{televised}} committee hearing, Thompson asked former White House aide Alexander Butterfield the famous question, [...] "Mr. Butterfield, <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> {{the existence of}} any listening devices in the Oval Office of the President?" [...] thereby publicly revealing the existence of tape recordings of conversations within the White House. National Public Radio later called that session and {{the discovery of the}} Watergate tapes [...] "a turning point in the investigation." ...|$|R

40|$|Unless you’ve {{been living}} under a rock, chances <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the {{impending}} EU referendum on 23 June. A key Brexit slogan is ‘we don’t want Brussels to dictate which laws the UK should pass’. This argument has gained traction with the public, {{thanks in part}} to the press reports on curly cucumbers and the ‘abolition’ of pounds and ounces. But many of the laws ‘imposed’ by the EU are to the benefit of millions of workers and employees, which, naturally, benefits our society...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir Percy, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> {{the fact}} that unless you listen to what I have to say, your wife will be dragged before the Committee of Public Safety in Paris within the next twenty-four hours?" [...] said Chauvelin firmly.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she said; [...] "I see {{you are not}} in the humour for loving me. You are in one of your sunless, inclement moods, {{when one}} feels a fellow-creature's {{presence}} is not welcome to you. You have such moods. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Wybrow went on. [...] "Will you {{pardon me}} if I venture on an indiscreet question? When you are {{acquainted with the}} circumstances, I am sure you will {{understand}} and excuse me. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> any--what shall I call it?--any romantic incident in Mr. Winterfield's past life?" ...|$|E

[...] "Now I {{know what}} you wanted with those gold and silver plates that came to you from London. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> what a {{character}} you have got here? There are some of us who suspect you of coining false money!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} mistaken," [...] I replied. [...] "I am only doubting whether your plan for {{relieving}} Mr. Van Brandt of his embarrassments is quite so simple as you suppose. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the delays {{that are likely}} to take place before {{it will be possible to}} borrow money on your policy of insurance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is an extraordinary, {{and not a}} very {{probable}} tale, young woman," [...] resumed Mr. Staunton. [...] "Here has been, {{according to}} your account, a great violence committed without any adequate motive. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the law of this country--that if you lodge this charge, you will be bound over to prosecute this gang?" ...|$|E

40|$|According to {{a common}} thesis about {{normative}} reasons for action, you {{have a reason to}} perform a given action only if you can act for that reason. This thesis has long had broad appeal and is intended to capture the practical character of practical reasons. I’ll call it the ‘Practicality Thesis’. Recently, however, various writers have developed subtly different objections to it, each designed to show that there can <b>be</b> actions <b>you</b> have a reason to perform even though you could not act for that reason––because, <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the reason-giving facts in the ways needed to act for the reason, it would no longer be a reason for you to so act. This article defends the Practicality Thesis against such objections. It considers some extant defenses but shows that these are inadequate. It then advances an alternative approach designed to counter any structurally similar objection...|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Keller spoke. His kindly {{instinct}} {{warned him}} not to refer to Minna, in alluding to the persons from whom he had derived his information.

6000|$|... "Are {{you sure}}," [...] said Uncle Chris seriously, [...] "that {{it is only}} that?

"In {{these cases}} - <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> this, Steam? - the plating at the bows, and {{particularly}} at the stern - we would also mention the floors beneath us - help us to resist any tendency to spring." [...] The frames spoke, in the solemn awed voice which people use when they have just come across something entirely new {{for the very first}} time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Such a {{thing would}} be quite {{impossible}} for many reasons, but I need only repeat you one that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> already <b>aware</b> <b>of.</b> I am engaged to Mr. Heigham." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, certainly! I {{think the}} best course now would be {{to speak to me}} frankly {{respecting}} Von Konigstein; and, if <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> anything which has passed in England of a nature--" ...|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Hardy {{then went}} on, {{addressing}} {{himself to the}} others: 'Of course this fire was lit with the especial intent of throwing us off the scent.

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] conceded Decoud, [...] "it's a {{wonderful}} thing to say with the sight of the San Tome mine, the greatest fact in the whole of South America, perhaps, before our very eyes. But look even at that, he has idealized this fact to a point--" [...] He paused. [...] "Mrs. Gould, are you aware to what point he has idealized the existence, the worth, the meaning of the San Tome mine? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Will {{you please}} answer my question? Am I to be a mere catspaw in your intrigues, in this miserable {{masquerade}} before the servants?

Are you aware that Ada has been hammering at your door every half-hour of your absence? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> that? How much,' she continued in a low, bitter voice, 'how much should I offer for her discretion?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, then," [...] counsel said, [...] "we come to this. You deputed Rowan to {{see what}} he could do with Sinclair. Do you realize your {{responsibility}} in this matter? <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> what happened?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall I indeed? Do {{you really}} desire it? But <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the consequences; it will involve {{you in a}} very cruel embarrassment, and {{certainly}} bring on a disagreement between us.|$|R

6000|$|... 'In Ipswich.' 'In Ipswich, ma'am! A duel in Ipswich!' {{said the}} magistrate, {{perfectly}} aghast at the notion. 'Impossible, ma'am; {{nothing of the}} kind can be contemplated in this town, I am persuaded. Bless my soul, ma'am, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the activity of our local magistracy? Do you happen to have heard, ma'am, that I rushed into a prize-ring on the fourth of May last, attended by only sixty special constables; and, at the hazard of falling a sacrifice to the angry passions of an infuriated multitude, prohibited a pugilistic contest between the Middlesex Dumpling and the Suffolk Bantam? A duel in Ipswich, ma'am?

6000|$|... 'Be {{honest with}} yourself,' it said. 'You aren't often. No man is. Look at the matter {{absolutely}} fairly.

What do you know about her except that she is a beauty? I grant you she's that, but <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the infinitesimal part looks play in married life? My dear chap, better is it for a man that he marry a sympathetic gargoyle than a Venus with a streak of hardness in her. You know--and you would admit it if you were honest with yourself--that this girl is hard. She's got a chilled-steel soul.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mary," [...] said Mr Mason solemnly, as he seated {{himself at}} the table and looked earnestly in the widow's face. [...] "Your {{knowledge}} of this man and your manner of speaking about him surprises me. I have long thought that you were not acting wisely in permitting Gascoyne to be so intimate; for, whatever he may in reality be, he is a suspicious character, to say the best of him; and although I know that you think you are right in encouraging his visits, other people do not know that; they may judge you harshly. I do not wish to pry into secrets--but you have sought to comfort me by bidding me have perfect confidence in this man. I must ask what knowledge you have of him. How far <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> his character and employment? How do you know that he is so trustworthy?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Continue despite problems.

50|$|Do {{not think}} of any good or evil whatsoever. Whenever a thought occurs, be <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> it; as soon as <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> it, it will vanish. If you remain {{for a long period}} forgetful of objects, you will {{naturally}} become unified.|$|R
6000|$|Margaret Duffe {{shot him}} a cold glance. [...] "You sent out the {{emergency}} order to force my hand. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> fully <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> what <b>you</b> <b>were</b> doing. <b>You</b> knew once the order was out there'd be no stopping things." ...|$|R
