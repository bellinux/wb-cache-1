The protocol provides mutual authentication and message origin authentication, via protection applied to (1) the integrity of URL, Method, and core HTTP headers, (2) the integrity of the message body, (3) message sequence, and (4) message replays. It optionally provides message body encryption. It does not provide header confidentiality (as messages would no longer be HTTP if their header fields were encrypted) or integrity protection applied to secondary headers (which may be legitimately altered by proxies).|$|R
40|$|The Internet is {{becoming}} a widely used medium for communications and electronic commerce. However, in {{the current state of}} the Internet, user applications need to be installed to ensure that these kinds of communications are kept confidential and private. The long term solution is to use IPv 6, the new Internet Protocol, which incorporates authentication and encryption in the lower part of the network layers, but until then there are higher level protocol such as SSL and SSH, to name a few. In this thesis, a general problem that can be used to "hack" into computer systems is outlined. This is usually a first step before packet sniffing is used to collect more passwords from other communications. The IPv 6 <b>authentication</b> <b>headers</b> and encapsulating security payload are introduced as the long term solution to combat both of the above problems. Finally, two current protocols are described that can authenticate and encrypt packets during communications on the Internet in the TCP/IP protocol without the need of the security features in IP (versions 4 and 6) ...|$|R

40|$|Clusters play a {{major role}} in {{scientific}} comput-ing. They eliminate the need of supercomput-ers. Communication protocols for cluster com-puting define efficiency and performance mea-sures for overall system design. Using IPv 6 as a protocol for cluster computing gives benefits such as • Network load balancing can make use of IPv 6 Congestion/Non-Congestion traffic mechanisms (e. g. for handling real-time data requests on clusters). • Geographically distributed cluster system can make use of embedded IPv 6 route op-timizations. • IP Anycast service has the ability to choose the topologically closest server available for handling the request. So it can be used to effectively load balance the network traffic. • IPv 6 <b>Authentication</b> <b>Headers</b> (AH) can be used to define what workstations are al-lowed to join the cluster. Moreover, Mobile IPv 6 [5] allows transpar-ent geographic mobility without affecting the present connections. This behaviour may be useful in building a clustered environment con-sisting of mobile agents in which a mobile de-vice (cellphones, PDA’s, etc.) submits a com-putation request to be performed on some local cluster accessible by the Internet. The uses for mobile cluster computing (MCC) can be deter-mining a person’s geographical location, mo-bile business operations (shopping via a cell-phone), handling a distributed robot by some mobile device, observing weather information by means of mobile nodes and sending the data to the cluster for future weather prediction (like predicting tornadoes), etc. Issues like timeli-ness could be better solved by using Mobile IPv 6. This paper covers IPv 6, its extension header mechanism, QoS, security, existing network transition, use of IPv 6 for cluster computing and mobile cluster computing using IPv 6 and its possible *nix 1 implementations. ...|$|R

50|$|IPsec is {{designed}} to protect TCP/IP communication in a secure manner. It {{is a set of}} security extensions developed by the Internet Task Force (IETF). It provides security and authentication at the IP layer by transforming data using encryption. Two main types of transformation that form the basis of IPsec: the <b>Authentication</b> <b>Header</b> (AH) and ESP. These two protocols provide data integrity, data origin authentication, and anti-replay service. These protocols can be used alone or in combination to provide the desired set of security services for the Internet Protocol (IP) layer.|$|E
50|$|The IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) was {{researched}} at the Naval Research Laboratory {{starting in}} 1992 {{as part of}} a DARPA-sponsored research project, and was openly published by IETF SIPP Working Group drafted in December 1993 as a security extension for SIPP. This ESP was originally derived from the US Department of Defense SP3D protocol, rather than being derived from the ISO Network-Layer Security Protocol (NLSP). The SP3D protocol specification was published by NIST in the late 1980s, but designed by the Secure Data Network System project of the US Department of Defense. The Security <b>Authentication</b> <b>Header</b> (AH) is derived partially from previous IETF standards work for authentication of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) version 2.|$|E
50|$|Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) is {{a member}} of the IPsec {{protocol}} suite. In IPsec it provides origin authenticity, integrity and confidentiality protection of packets. ESP also supports encryption-only and authentication-only configurations, but using encryption without authentication is strongly discouraged because it is insecure. Unlike <b>Authentication</b> <b>Header</b> (AH), ESP in transport mode does not provide integrity and authentication for the entire IP packet. However, in Tunnel Mode, where the entire original IP packet is encapsulated with a new packet header added, ESP protection is afforded to the whole inner IP packet (including the inner header) while the outer header (including any outer IPv4 options or IPv6 extension headers) remains unprotected. ESP operates directly on top of IP, using IP protocol number 50.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Real-world {{deployments}} {{of wireless}} sensor networks (WSNs) require secure communication. Recently, WSNs and traditional IP networks are more tightly integrated using IPv 6 and 6 LoWPAN. Available IPv 6 protocol stacks can use IPsec to secure data exchange. Thus, it is desirable to extend 6 LoWPAN such that IPsec communication with IPv 6 nodes is possible. It is beneficial to use IPsec because the existing end-points on the Internet {{do not need to}} be modified to communicate securely with the WSN. We propose a 6 LoWPAN extension for IPsec.
