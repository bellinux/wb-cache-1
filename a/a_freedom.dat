5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{publicity}} the correspondence created, <b>a</b> <b>freedom</b> of information request was lodged concerning Project A119. It was only then that A Study of Lunar Research Flights– Volume I was made public, over forty years after its inception. A search for the other volumes of documentation revealed that other reports were destroyed in the 1980s by the Illinois Institute of Technology.|$|E

5|$|Global News {{reporter}} Jennifer Tryon {{attempted to}} file <b>a</b> <b>Freedom</b> of Information {{request for documents}} on June 29, but was refused; an employee came out {{from the back of}} the offices, and turned the City Clerk's chair around, so that they couldn't respond. City officials then called the OPP. After the request, the city issued a two line statement that documents are now part of investigations. OPP noted that the documents are still available through Freedom of Information requests, and that the situation likely didn't warrant an emergency call to police. The reporter was provided a FOI application on police arrival, and told to ignore instructions from their superiors on calling police. Tryon, producer Kieron O'Dea and cameraman Trevor Owens would later receive a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Breaking National News Reportage at the 1st Canadian Screen Awards.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Dooley {{was invented}} by Dunne to replace a similar {{character}} whose real-life analogue had objected. By having the garrulous bartender speak in dialect and live in an unfashionable area of Chicago Dunne gained <b>a</b> <b>freedom</b> of expression he often did not have in standard English. The first four years of the weekly column made Mr. Dooley popular in Chicago, but little noticed elsewhere. Dunne was a rapidly rising newspaperman, and the pieces mainly appeared in the Chicago paper which he worked for. During that time, Dunne detailed the daily life of Bridgeport through Dooley's lips, painting a portrait of ethnic urban life unparalleled in 19th-century American literature.|$|E
5|$|On July 26, 2015, the Argus Leader, {{the daily}} {{newspaper}} in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, {{published an article}} detailing the extensive files on McGovern compiled through the years by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, including letters and notations from FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, revealing that Hoover had a direct interest in the FBI monitoring of McGovern. The newspaper also published the complete FBI file on McGovern, obtained through <b>a</b> <b>Freedom</b> of Information Act request filed shortly after McGovern's death.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} major {{operations}} in which the ships were involved was Operation Eagle Claw launched by USS Nimitz in 1980 after she had deployed to the Indian Ocean {{in response to the}} taking of hostages in the U.S. embassy in Tehran. Although initially part of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, Eisenhower relieved Nimitz in this operation after her service in the Mediterranean Sea. Nimitz conducted <b>a</b> <b>Freedom</b> of Navigation exercise alongside the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal in August 1981 in the Gulf of Sidra, near Libya. During this exercise, two of the ship's F-14 Tomcats shot down two Libyan aircraft in {{what became known as the}} Gulf of Sidra incident. In 1987, Vinson participated in the first U.S. carrier deployment in the Bering Sea, and Nimitz provided security during the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{represents}} a Muslim-American who was detained but never {{accused of a}} crime in Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, a civil suit against former Attorney General John Ashcroft. In January 2010, the American military released the names of 645 detainees held at the Bagram Theater Internment Facility in Afghanistan, modifying its long-held position against publicizing such information. This list was prompted by <b>a</b> <b>Freedom</b> of Information Act lawsuit filed in September 2009 by the ACLU, whose lawyers had also requested detailed information about conditions, rules and regulations.|$|E
5|$|The {{project has}} been criticised for its delayed {{completion}} date; in 2009 the Department for Transport confirmed that Network Rail was developing High Level Output Specification options for the station, with an estimated date for the re-opening of the platforms of 2014, seven years after their closure. The cost of maintaining the disused platforms up to late 2010 was found via <b>a</b> <b>Freedom</b> of Information request to have been £4.1million. South West Trains subsequently confirmed that platform 20 would be brought back into use in 2014, hosting certain services to and from Reading, Windsor, Staines and Hounslow. These would be 10-car trains newly formed from refurbished SWT and former Gatwick Express rolling stock. Platform 20 reopened in May, with access via platform 19, and platforms 21 and 22 in October after steps were constructed over the former Eurostar entrance to access the platforms.|$|E

5|$|Zenobia has {{inspired}} scholars, academics, musicians and actors; her fame has {{lingered in the}} West, and is supreme in the Middle East. As a heroic queen with a tragic end, she stands alongside Cleopatra and Boudica. The queen's legend turned her into an idol, that can be reinterpreted to accommodate the needs of writers and historians; thus, Zenobia has been by turns <b>a</b> <b>freedom</b> fighter, a hero of the oppressed and a national symbol. The queen is a female role model; according to historian Michael Rostovtzeff, Catherine the Great liked to compare herself to Zenobia {{as a woman who}} created military might and an intellectual court. During the 1930s, thanks to an Egyptian-based feminist press, Zenobia became an icon for women's-magazine readers in the Arabic-speaking world as a strong, nationalistic female leader.|$|E
5|$|The unnamed Narrator is a {{traveling}} automobile recall specialist {{who suffers from}} insomnia. When he is unsuccessful at receiving medical assistance for it, the admonishing doctor suggests he realize his relatively small amount of suffering by visiting {{a support group for}} testicular cancer victims. The group assumes that he, too, is affected like they are, and he spontaneously weeps into the nurturing arms of another man, finding <b>a</b> <b>freedom</b> from the catharsis that relieves his insomnia. He decides to participate in support groups of various kinds, always allowing the groups to assume that he suffers what they do. However, he begins to notice another impostor, Marla Singer, whose presence reminds him that he is attending these groups dishonestly, and this disturbs his bliss. The two negotiate to avoid their attending the same groups, but, before going their separate ways, Marla gives him her phone number.|$|E
