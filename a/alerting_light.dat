50|$|The {{riders in}} each car are {{restrained}} {{by a single}} solid lap bar that is locked across {{the body of the}} car, making the ride unsuitable for young children or people of short stature. The bar must be manually locked or unlocked, and only locks in one position. Lights and music are also controlled by the operator, which (as the name suggests) contribute heavily to the ride experience. After a certain amount of rotations or minutes, the ride operator will be alerted by the control box that the speed is going to increase, usually by a light on the box. At that time the operator will speak on a microphone asking the riders if they would like to go faster. Sometimes the ride operator can do this earlier than the <b>alert</b> <b>light</b> to build suspense. After a minute or two of faster speed, the ride will then slow down, and the operator can then ask the riders if they would like to go backwards.

40|$|Study Objectives: Light can induce {{an acute}} {{alerting}} response in humans; however, {{it is unknown}} whether {{the magnitude of this}} response is simply a function of the absolute illuminance of the light itself, or whether it depends on illuminance history preceding the stimulus. Here, we compared the effects of illuminance history on the alerting response to a subsequent light stimulus. Design: A randomized, crossover design was used to compare the effect of two illuminance histories (1 lux vs. 90 lux) on the alerting response to a 6. 5 -h 90 -lux light stimulus during the biological night. Setting: Intensive Physiologic Monitoring Unit, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA. Participants: Fourteen healthy young adults (6 F; 23. 5 ± 2. 9 years). Interventions: Participants were administered two 6. 5 -h light exposures (LE) of 90 lux during the biological night. For 3 days prior to each LE, participants were exposed to either 1 lux or 90 lux during the wake episode. Measurements and Results: The <b>alerting</b> response to <b>light</b> was assessed using subjective sleepiness ratings, lapses of attention, and reaction times as measured with an auditory psychomotor vigilance task, as well as power density in the delta/theta range of the waking EEG. The <b>alerting</b> response to <b>light</b> was greater and lasted longer when the LE followed exposure to 1 lux compared to 90 lux light.

40|$|We tested whether evening {{exposure}} to unilateral photic stimulation has repercussions on interhemispheric EEG asymmetries during wakefulness and later sleep. Because <b>light</b> exerts an <b>alerting</b> response in humans, which correlates with {{a decrease in}} waking EEG theta/alpha-activity {{and a reduction in}} sleep EEG delta activity, we hypothesized that EEG activity in these frequency bands show interhemispheric asymmetries after unilateral bright light (1, 500 lux) exposure. A 2 -h hemi-field light exposure acutely suppressed occipital EEG alpha activity in the ipsilateral hemisphere activated by light. Subjects felt more <b>alert</b> during bright <b>light</b> than dim light, an effect that was significantly more pronounced during activation of the right than the left visual cortex. During subsequent sleep, occipital EEG activity in the delta and theta range was significantly reduced after activation of the right visual cortex but not after stimulation of the left visual cortex. Furthermore, hemivisual field light exposure was able to shift the left predominance in occipital spindle EEG activity toward the stimulated hemisphere. Time course analysis revealed that this spindle shift remained significant during the first two sleep cycles. Our results reflect rather a hemispheric asymmetry in the <b>alerting</b> action of <b>light</b> than a use-dependent recovery function of sleep in response to the visual stimulation during prior waking. However, the observed shift in the spindle hemispheric dominance in the occipital cortex may still represent subtle local use-dependent recovery functions during sleep in a frequency range different from the delta range...|$|R

40|$|CONTEXT: Light exposure, {{particularly}} at the short-wavelength range, triggers several nonvisual responses in humans. However, {{the extent to which}} the melatonin-suppressing and <b>alerting</b> effect of <b>light</b> differs among individuals remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: Here we investigated whether blue-enriched polychromatic light impacts differentially on melatonin and subjective and objective alertness in healthy participants genotyped for the PERIOD 3 (PER 3) variable-number, tandem-repeat polymorphism. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen healthy young men homozygous for the PER 3 polymorphism (PER 3 (5 / 5) and PER 3 (4 / 4)) underwent a balanced crossover design during the winter season, with light exposure to compact fluorescent lamps of 40 lux at 6500 K and at 2500 K during 2 h in the evening. RESULTS: In comparison to light at 2500 K, blue-enriched light at 6500 K induced a significant suppression of the evening rise in endogenous melatonin levels in PER 3 (5 / 5) individuals but not in PER 3 (4 / 4). Likewise, PER 3 (5 / 5) individuals exhibited a more pronounced <b>alerting</b> response to <b>light</b> at 6500 K than PER 3 (4 / 4) volunteers. Waking electroencephalographic activity in the theta range (5 - 7 Hz), a putative correlate of sleepiness, was drastically attenuated during light exposure at 6500 K in PER 3 (5 / 5) individuals as compared with PER 3 (4 / 4). CONCLUSIONS: We provide first evidence that humans homozygous for the PER 3 5 / 5 allele are particularly sensitive to blue-enriched light, as indexed by the suppression of endogenous melatonin and waking theta activity. Light sensitivity in humans may be modulated by a clock gene polymorphism implicated in the sleep-wake regulation. Peer reviewe...|$|R

2500|$|Allied {{concerns}} over the Combined Fleet's presence at Singapore eased considerably during March when it was learned that the ships there were being put through a maintenance program and the Japanese {{did not intend to}} undertake major operations in the Indian Ocean area. Allied military commanders believed that the March 1944 emergency had some beneficial effects. Rear-Admiral Christie judged that military personnel and civilians in Western Australia had become complacent before the emergency, and the mobilisation had gone some way to addressing this. The RAAF and USAAF also regarded the transfer of forces to Western Australia as having provided useful experience in rapidly redeploying combat units. An editorial published in the newspaper The West Australian on 13 March also judged that the air raid alert on 10 March had given Perth's population a reminder of the potential threat posed by [...] "hit and run" [...] raids, but was highly critical of the lack of information which had been released on the cause of the <b>alert,</b> especially in <b>light</b> of the rumours which were sweeping the city.|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} aim of today's lighting {{research is}} defining and quantifying the optimal parameters of <b>light</b> for maximal <b>alerting</b> response. They {{would be useful}} in various clinical and non-clinical applications. The debate has covered the light intensity, the spectral distribution, {{the duration of the}} light exposure, and the circadian phase in which the light is administered. However, no consensus over the optimal parameters has been found. The thesis claims that the lack of consensus is due to three things. First, the terminology around alertness is confounding and alertness has not been defined properly. Second, the methods used to study light-induced alertness are not always optimal, because they do not consider the delicacy of the light stimulus nor are they based on the physiology of alertness. Third, the research has concentrated too much on effects instead of causes and therefore the mechanisms behind the <b>alerting</b> effects of <b>light</b> are not yet fully known. The thesis addresses these problems. It begins by discussing the physiology and the terminology behind the term "alertness". On the basis of the discussion, it defines alertness as an activation state of the brain that is induced by stimuli and reduced by the lack of them. The thesis continues with an evaluation of the methods used to study light-induced alertness. First the methods are assessed theoretically and after that the practical testing of heart rate, skin conductance, pupil size and subjective sleepiness is reported. Together, the evaluations show that the methods based on the autonomic nervous system activity are good for detecting the effects. For investigating the causes behind these effects monitoring the central nervous system should be used. Brain imaging is highly recommended. Further on the thesis discusses the neurophysiological mechanisms behind the light-induced alertness in daytime, which are less known than the night-time mechanisms. A new model of two separate pathways from the retina to the activation system is suggested. The new model links emotions to the <b>alerting</b> effects of <b>light.</b> The correlation of subjective mood and alertness is verified with a practical study. A test protocol to study the causal relationship of light, emotions and alertness objectively is also suggested. In addition to the objectives, a few interesting observations from the practical studies are reported. First, exposure to blue-enriched white light was shown to help students to retain their alertness during the natural dip time in the afternoon in the autumn compared to exposure to normal white light. Second, changes in the light exposure were shown to induce greater alerting effects than a constant light exposure. These observations contribute to the search for the optimal parameters of light exposure...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the effect of methods of photoactivation and {{insertion}} on the Knoop hardness of the Z 100 and Alert composite resins. The specimens were confected in cavities measuring 4 x 4 mm. The insertion of material was carried out by means of two methods: single-portion technique and insertion of two 2 -mm-thick layers. When inserted in a single portion, the resin was compressed with a static load of 1 kgf on a glass slab recovered with a polyester strip, in order to remove the excess of material. After the removal of the glass slab and polyester strip, the materials were photoactivated by means of continuous light emitted by a XL 3000 unit with a light intensity of 520 mW/cm 2 for 40 seconds; double pulse, with light emission of 150 mW/cm 2 for 10 seconds, plus 30 seconds with light intensity of 520 mW/cm 2 emitted by a XL 3000 unit; and pulsatile light of 520 mW/cm emitted by the Optilux 400 unit, turned on for 2 seconds and off for 2 seconds, during 60 seconds. The two layers of the material submitted to double insertion were photoactivated in the same conditions as the bulk-inserted material, and the excess of material was also removed from the second layer. After storage in a stove at 37 C and 100 % relative humidity for 24 hours, the specimens were embedded in polyester resin, trimmed and polished with sandpaper and diamond slurry. Knoop hardness was assessed in 4 depths with a HMV Shimadzu penetrometer under the load of 50 g during 30 seconds. The data submitted to ANOVA and Tukey's test revealed that Z 100 presented greater hardness values; double insertion was better than single insertion; the hardness at the surface was smaller than that at the bottom of the specimen, regardless of other factors. For Z 100, all activation methods produced smaller hardness values when double insertion was carried out. Meanwhile, for <b>Alert,</b> continuous <b>light</b> promoted statistical similarity between the insertion techniques. For Z 100, there was statistical similarity between the activation methods only when the double-insertion technique was employed.

The orbital intensity profile created with the Swift Burst <b>Alert</b> Telescope (Swift–BAT) <b>light</b> curve shows an indication of IGR J 16393 – 4643 being an eclipsing system with a short eclipse semi-angle θE ∼ 17 °.

Pulse profiles created for different energy bands have complex morphology, which shows some energy dependence and increases in pulse fraction with energy. We have also investigated broad-band spectral characteristics, phase-averaged spectra and resolving the pulse phase into peak and trough phases.
