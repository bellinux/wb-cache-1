5|$|On 4 October 1943, Smith {{took off}} from Idku at dawn in a Hurricane Mk IIC to escort a {{shipping}} convoy. Light was extremely poor, and Smith's throttle malfunctioned; he failed to take off quickly enough to clear a blast wall {{at the end of}} the runway. The undercarriage of the aircraft scraped against some sandbags on the wall, causing Smith to lose control of the plane and crash. The shoulder straps on his harness, built to withstand stress of up to , snapped, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> smashed against the Hurricane's gyrosight. Smith suffered serious facial injuries, and broke his jaw, a leg and a shoulder. Doctors thought at first that his back had also been broken, but it had only been buckled.|$|E
500|$|The first Belle Vue Circus {{took place}} in 1922, {{but it was not}} {{considered}} a success. The next was staged in 1929, after the company negotiated a deal with the Blackpool Tower Company to provide acts and equipment for what subsequently became a regular Christmas event held in the Kings Hall. One of the first arrivals from Blackpool was ringmaster George Lockhart, known as [...] "the prince of ringmasters". Lockhart became synonymous with the Belle Vue Circus, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> used on many advertising posters. Zoo superintendent Gerald Iles included some of the zoo's animals in the circus, in a feature called Noah's Ark.|$|E
500|$|Ruth {{made one}} final trip {{on behalf of}} American Legion Baseball, then entered Memorial Hospital, where he would die. He was never told he had cancer, but before his death, had surmised it. He was able to leave the {{hospital}} for a few short trips, including a final visit to Baltimore. On July 26, 1948, Ruth left the hospital to attend the premiere of the film The Babe Ruth Story. Shortly thereafter, Ruth returned to the hospital for the final time. He was barely able to speak. Ruth's condition gradually grew worse; only a few visitors were allowed to see him, one of whom was National League president and future Commissioner of Baseball Ford Frick. [...] "Ruth was so thin it was unbelievable. He had been such a big man and his arms were just skinny little bones, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> so haggard", Frick said years later.|$|E

500|$|After {{publishing}} two novels, Dead Men Tell No Tales in 1899 and Peccavi in 1900, Hornung {{published a}} second collection of Raffles stories, The Black Mask, in 1901. The nearly broke Manders is told {{to apply for}} the post of a nurse to an elderly invalid, who then reveals himself to be Raffles, who, as Manders describes, had [...] "aged twenty years; he looked fifty at the very least. His hair was white; there was no trick about that; <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> another white. The lines about the corners of the eyes and mouth were both many and deep". In the final story of the collection, [...] "The Knees of the Gods", Raffles and Manders enlist in the army to fight in the Second Boer War; the story closes with Manders wounded and Raffles killed. The critics again complained about the criminal aspect; The Spectator declared [...] "this sort of book presents crime in a form too entertaining and attractive to be moral", while the reviewer for The Illustrated London News thought that Hornung's [...] "invention has obviously flagged... It is laughable, in a sense which the author never intended, to hear these burglars rant about the honour of Old England. It is a pity that the man who wrote Peccavi should stoop to this".|$|E
2500|$|Eventually, Menelik acquiesced to the {{superior}} position of Yohannes and, on 20 March 1878, Menelik [...] "approached Yohannes on foot. He {{was carrying a}} rock on his neck <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> down in the traditional form of submission." [...] Very aware of how precarious his own position was, Yohannes recognized Menelik as Negus of Shewa and gave him numerous presents which included four cannons, several hundred modern Remington rifles, and ammunition for both. Menelik's submission to Yohannes brought twin policies into play: to gain the imperial throne, Menelik had to increase his revenue {{for the purchase of}} expensive and modern weapons, and in the meantime he had to maintain peace with the emperor and accede to his demands.|$|E
2500|$|Túrin {{is said to}} {{have been}} greatly {{affected}} by the deaths of his friends; thus after overcoming pestilence himself and the death of Lalaith, Túrin's character was hardened and he became even more reserved. Tolkien also stated that Túrin ever after [...] "sought in all faces of women the face of Lalaith," [...] that he did not love Finduilas because [...] "his mind and heart were elsewhere, by rivers in springs long past," [...] and that Túrin did fall in love with Níniel because she reminded him of Lalaith. The grief that he had slain Beleg [...] "was graven on the face of Túrin and never faded"; early Tolkien's writings add that after this time [...] "wild and black was his hair yet streaked with grey, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> pale and marked as with deep sorrows of the past." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 12, 1897, London (age 21) and his sister's husband Captain Shepard {{sailed to}} join the Klondike Gold Rush. This was the setting for some of his first {{successful}} stories. London's time in the harsh Klondike, however, was detrimental to his health. Like so many other men who were malnourished in the goldfields, London developed scurvy. His gums became swollen, leading {{to the loss of}} his four front teeth. A constant gnawing pain affected his hip and leg muscles, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> stricken with marks that always reminded him of the struggles he faced in the Klondike. Father William Judge, [...] "The Saint of Dawson", had a facility in Dawson that provided shelter, food and any available medicine to London and others. His struggles there inspired London's short story, [...] "To Build a Fire" [...] (1902, revised in 1908), which many critics assess as his best.|$|E
2500|$|One {{of these}} {{teachers}} (Miss Allen of Illinois), whose school was at Cotton Gin Port in Monroe County, was visited ... {{between one and}} {{two o'clock in the}} morning on March 1871, by about fifty men mounted and disguised. Each man wore a long white robe <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> covered by a loose mask with scarlet stripes. She was ordered to get up and dress which she did at once and then admitted to her room the captain and lieutenant who in addition to the usual disguise had long horns on their heads and a sort of device in front. The lieutenant had a pistol in his hand and he and the captain sat down while eight or ten men stood inside the door and the porch was full. They treated her [...] "gentlemanly and quietly" [...] but complained of the heavy school-tax, said she must stop teaching and go away and warned her that they never gave a second notice. She heeded the warning and left the county.|$|E
2500|$|Most often, kobolds remain {{completely}} invisible. Although King Goldemar (or Goldmar), {{a famous}} kobold from Castle Hardenstein, had hands [...] "thin {{like those of}} a frog, cold and soft to the feel", he never showed himself. The master of Hundermühlen Castle, where Heinzelmann lived, convinced the kobold to let him touch him one night. The kobold's fingers were childlike, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> like a skull, without body heat. One legend tells of a female servant taking a fancy to her house's kobold and asking to see him. The kobold refuses, claiming that to look upon him would be terrifying. Undeterred, the maid insists, and the kobold tells her to meet him later—and to bring along a pail of cold water. The kobold waits for the maid, nude and with a butcher knife in his back. The maid faints at the sight, and the kobold wakes her with the cold water. In one variant, the maid sees a dead baby floating in a cask full of blood; years before, the woman had born a bastard child, killed it, and hidden it in such a cask. Legends tell of those who try to trick a kobold into showing itself being punished for the misdeed. For example, Heinzelmann tricked a nobleman into thinking that the kobold was hiding in a jug. When the nobleman covered the jug's mouth to trap the creature, the kobold chided him: ...|$|E

2500|$|McCreight next saw the Colonel in {{the main}} {{dining room of the}} Bellevue-Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at the close of his 1915 season. Cody was having breakfast with his wife and McCreight joined them for a chat. McCreight was {{surprised}} at the Colonel’s appearance. He had aged greatly since their last meeting. His hair was a mass of straggling, wispy white <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>was</b> deeply wrinkled. “We talked about Iron Tail's death, and Cody almost wept in his grief. He keenly regretted not receiving my wire, believing as I did that the ailing chief might have recovered among friends at The Wigwam. Tactfully I changed the subject.” “He said that he would go out again for the 1916 season, and hoped to see us at the Wigwam on that roundup. But the old Colonel was about {{at the end of the}} long trail.” [...] McCreight’s last meeting with Buffalo Bill was in 1916. “He went out as promised at the start of the 1916 campaign and I saw him at the end of the last performance. Going to his tent at the rear of the show-grounds, I found him lying on his blankets, with his snowy head resting on his saddle. He was asleep, but roused at once at my greeting. He arose, shook hands, and immediately spoke of Iron Tail. With deep emotion, he said he was going to put a granite stone on the chief's grave, with a replica of the Buffalo nickel (for which Iron Tail had posed) carved on it as a memento. Cody's voice trembled as he again expressed his great regret at not receiving my telegram that might have saved Iron Tail's life. I was shocked and saddened to observe how feeble he was. I helped him to his feet, guided him to his private car and saw him to his berth. I shook hands with him for the last time. Not long after, Buffalo Bill went to his last long sleep.” [...] Col. Cody died on January 10, 1917, just six months after Chief Iron Tail's death. In a ceremony at Buffalo Bill's grave on Lookout Mountain, west of Denver, Colorado, Chief Flying Hawk laid his war staff of eagle feathers on the grave. Each of the veteran Show Indians placed a Buffalo nickel on the imposing stone as a symbol of the Indian, the buffalo, and the scout, figures since the 1880s that were symbolic of the early history of the American West. Chief Flying Hawk's dear friends Buffalo Bill and Chief Iron Tail had gone to the Sand Hills.|$|E
