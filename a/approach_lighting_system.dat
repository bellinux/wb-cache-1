25|$|The {{investigation}} commission {{found no}} fault of the pilot or air traffic control, instead focusing on short-cuts being taken by the Swedish Air Force and the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) to not configure military airports in line with civilian regulations. The finding caused a surge of funding which subsequently caused military airports to change their instrument landing system and <b>approach</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>system</b> to meet civilian requirements.|$|E
25|$|Pan Am Flight 845, a Boeing 747, on 30 July 1971. When {{taking off}} from San Francisco International Airport, the plane struck the <b>approach</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>system</b> after taxiing onto a much too short runway. After the impact, the plane {{continued}} into the takeoff roll, though its fuselage, landing gear, and 3 out of 4 hydraulic systems were badly damaged. After making a full circle over the Pacific Ocean {{for an hour and}} 42 minutes and dumping fuel, the plane made a hard emergency landing at San Francisco, ending on its tail. All 218 passengers survived with just a few minor injuries.|$|E
25|$|When {{the airport}} opened, {{it had not}} yet had its landing fees {{approved}} of by the authorities, {{and use of the}} airport was at first free. The airport did not have any scheduled flights, but Norsk Hydro operated a number of charter flights, mostly to Oslo, operated by Coast Aero Center. At first, the airport did not have any employees, so the snow clearance was done by the municipality. In early 1986, the airport's two first employees were hired, both working with flight information service. The airport had no rights for any state grants, so the company had to raise additional capital to cover operating expenses and pay the NOK2.5 million the instrument landing system cost. In March 1986 the airport was granted NOK1.5 from the Ministry of Finance to cover parts of the cost. The airport was set up with Category II, but lacked pulsating light approach slope indicator and <b>approach</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

500|$|Dubious {{about the}} {{prospects}} for advancement in the post-war military, Lerew applied for a role in the recently established Provisional International Civil Aviation Organisation (PICAO) in March 1946, while still Director of Flying Safety in the RAAF. He had just been appointed Air Officer Commanding North-Western Area in Darwin on 7October 1946 when PICAO offered him the position of Technical Officer, which he accepted. He left the RAAF on 8November 1946, emigrating to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to take up his new employment with PICAO, which became ICAO in 1947. Appointed Chief of Aerodromes, Air Routes and Ground Aids Section in January 1951, he conducted assessments of airfields throughout the world, and led the team that recommended Hellinikon be developed as Athens' international airport. Lerew received credit for several of ICAO's accomplishments over the next decade, including various administrative reforms within the organisation and finalising a standard runway <b>approach</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>system</b> in 1953 following five years of disagreement among members. A colleague remembered him as having [...] "that very fortunate duality of personality, being serious, efficient and knowledgeable in his official capacity, with an equally inherent twin ability to really liven things up off-duty".|$|E
2500|$|The {{flight was}} en route from Stockholm to Ängelholm, but bad weather caused it to skip stopovers at Hultsfred and Halmstad. There was less than [...] {{visibility}} and a low cloud base at Ängelholm, so air traffic control lit its <b>approach</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>system.</b> As the civilian sector at Swedish Air Force base F10 Ängelholm, the airport had a military configuration and did not follow normal civilian configuration. This caused a pilot error in the navigation and the aircraft landed [...] before the runway threshold. The aircraft inverted while sliding after impact. Despite the death toll, three people walked uninjured from the crash.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970 the Capital Region Airport Authority {{was created}} {{pursuant}} to Michigan Public Act Number 73. [...] The following year jurisdiction of Capital City Airport was {{transferred from the}} State of Michigan to the Airport Authority. [...] The airport's first surveillance radar was installed in 1973. [...] By 1977 the <b>approach</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>system</b> and instrument landing system for runway 10R was activated. [...] The same year Mason Jewett Field was purchased as a reliever airfield for Capital City Airport. [...] A Michigan historical marker was erected at the terminal for local aviator Philip Orin Parmelee in 1978. From 1978 to 1991 fixed-base operator and aerial photography company White Star Photography purchased and operated from the Francis Aviation Complex.|$|E

50|$|July 21, 1961: Flight 779, a Douglas DC-6A (N6118C) {{operating}} Seattle-Shemya crashed {{short of}} the runway, killing the six crew. The cause of the crash {{was due to the}} fact that the power to the runway and <b>approach</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>systems</b> had been cut off two days earlier, and the control tower neglected to inform the pilots as they made their approach in the dark.|$|R
2500|$|The Polish {{report also}} found three {{deficiencies}} regarding the Smolensk airport which {{contributed to the}} crash. One was {{a large number of}} obstacles (mostly tall trees) in the area before the runway which should have been removed to keep the protected approach airspace clear of obstructions. The second deficiency was with the <b>approach</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>system,</b> which was charted incorrectly and not well maintained. Many bulbs were burned out, several others were missing their lenses, and others were obscured by shrubbery. The third concern was with the airport information received by Poland, which contained incorrect information.

2500|$|Mariehamn Airport {{used two}} radio {{transmitters}} for contacting airplanes: the [...] "MAR" [...] and [...] "Locator S" [...] beacons. The airport was not {{equipped with an}} instrument landing system (ILS) or a radar; while ILS equipment had been purchased for the airport {{two years before the}} accident, local land disputes postponed their installation. A low-power <b>approach</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>system</b> stretched from 1020 meters before the runway and was powered from the same source as [...] "Locator S" [...] which could mean turning on the lights may have reduced the voltage to the beacon. The area around the beacon, which had the highest obstacle profile, did not have any lights. Contemporary press even went to call the landing equipment of the airport a [...] "death trap" [...] after the accident.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the flight}} was [...] from runway 34 and at an {{altitude}} of , air traffic control instructed the crew to continue the approach and report as soon as they had established visual contact with the runway. The crew acknowledged the call and prepared the aircraft for landing, deploying the landing gear and extending the flaps. Continuing to descend, the aircraft reached its minimum descent altitude (MDA) of [...] – the lowest altitude to which descent is authorized on final approach or during circle-to-land maneuvering in execution of a standard instrument approach procedure where no electronic glideslope is provided (the airport was not equipped with an instrument landing system) – but both pilots said that they still had no visual reference to the runway or its <b>approach</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>system</b> because of the thick fog. One pilot discerned some lights in the distance but was not sure what exactly they belonged to.|$|E
50|$|Depth {{perception}} is inoperative at the distances usually involved in flying aircraft, {{and so the}} position and distance of a runway with respect to an aircraft must be judged by a pilot using only two-dimensional cues such as perspective, as well as angular size and movement within the visual field. <b>Approach</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>systems</b> provide additional cues that bear a known relationship to the runway itself and help pilots to judge distance and alignment for landing.|$|R

BUA (Channel Islands) Douglas C-47B-20-DK (registration: G-ANTB) was operating a scheduled international passenger flight from Paris Orly to Jersey. Despite the deteriorating weather conditions at Jersey's States Airport, the crew decided to continue its approach to runway 27.

Initially, 126.59 acres of land for second runway was handed over to Airports Authority of India (AAI). In March 2011, by acquiring 136 acres of land from the state government, AAI completed extension of the 2,035 m secondary runway by 1,400m, whose commissioning, initially planned to be by November 2011, has been delayed as the <b>approach</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>system</b> has not been installed. While the cost of extending the runway was projected to be about [...] 240 crore, that of the bridge is almost [...] 230 crore. A bridge has been constructed across the Adyar river to extend the secondary runway by a length of 1,400m to a total length of 3,445m, including 835m on the northern side of the river. The bridge accommodates the runway and a taxiway, making Chennai Airport the only international airport in India to have a runway across a river. In Mumbai, only an end of the runway is over Mithi river. When the Airports Authority of India (AAI) recommissions the secondary runway, Chennai airport will join the league of airports with a functional runway across a river.|$|E

40|$|Synthetic {{vision is}} a computer-generated {{image of the}} {{external}} scene topography that is generated from aircraft attitude, high-precision navigation information, and data of the terrain, obstacles, cultural features, and other required flight information. A synthetic vision system (SVS) enhances this basic functionality with real-time integrity to ensure {{the validity of the}} databases, perform obstacle detection and independent navigation accuracy verification, and provide traffic surveillance. Over the last five years, NASA and its industry partners have developed and deployed SVS technologies for commercial, business, and general aviation aircraft which have been shown to provide significant improvements in terrain awareness and reductions in the potential for Controlled-Flight-Into-Terrain incidents/accidents compared to current generation cockpit technologies. It has been hypothesized that SVS displays can greatly improve the safety and operational flexibility of flight in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) to a level comparable to clear-day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC), regardless of actual weather conditions or time of day. An experiment was conducted to evaluate SVS and SVS-related technologies as well as the influence of where the information is provided to the pilot (e. g., on a Head-Up or Head-Down Display) for consideration in defining landing minima based upon aircraft and airport equipage. The "operational considerations" evaluated under this effort included reduced visibility, decision altitudes, and airport equipage requirements, such as <b>approach</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>systems,</b> for SVS-equipped aircraft. Subjective results from the present study suggest that synthetic vision imagery on both head-up and head-down displays may offer benefits in situation awareness; workload; and approach and landing performance in the visibility levels, <b>approach</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>systems,</b> and decision altitudes tested...|$|R

50|$|<b>Approach</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>systems</b> are {{designed}} to allow the pilot to quickly and positively identify visibility distances in Instrument meteorological conditions. For example, if the aircraft is at the middle marker, and the middle marker is located 3600 feet from the threshold, the Decision Bar is 2600 feet ahead. If the procedure calls for {{at least half a}} statute mile flight visibility (roughly 2600 feet), spotting the Decision Bar at the marker would indicate enough flight visibility to continue the procedure. In addition, the shorter bars before and after the Decision Bar are spaced either 100 feet or 200 feet apart, depending on the ALS type. The number of short bars the pilot can see can be used to determine flight visibility. Approaches with lower minimums use the more precise 100-foot spacing systems for more accurate identification of visibility.|$|R
