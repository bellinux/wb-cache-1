5|$|Officials at {{the court}} of Emperor Ai of Han (r. 7–1 BC) {{attempted}} to implement reforms limiting the amount of land nobles and wealthy landowners could own legally, but were unsuccessful. When Wang Mang {{took control of the}} government in 9 AD, he abolished the purchase and sale of land in a system called King's Fields (王田). This was <b>a</b> <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> well-field system, where the government owned the land and assured every peasant an equal share to cultivate. Within three years, complaints from wealthy landowners and nobles forced Wang Mang to repeal the reform. After Gengshi (r. 23–25 AD) and Guangwu (r. 25–57 AD) restored the Han dynasty, they relied on the service of great landholding families to secure their position in society.

Belt presses are still used today, but they are built on a much larger scale than those of the original design.|$|E
