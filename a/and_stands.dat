5|$|Diddy Kong Racing {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} upon release. The graphics, audio and gameplay {{were the most}} praised aspects of the game, however minor criticism was directed at its repetitiveness. The game has sold 4.8 million copies since release <b>and</b> <b>stands</b> as the Nintendo 64's eighth best-selling game. A cancelled sequel, Donkey Kong Racing, was in development for the GameCube, however it was abandoned after Microsoft's purchase of Rare for £375 million in 2002. An enhanced remake for the Nintendo DS titled Diddy Kong Racing DS was released worldwide in 2007.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of Bradman, generally regarded as the greatest batsman of all time, {{and the fact that}} he had announced that it was his farewell international tour, the Australians were greeted with much fanfare across the country, and many records for match attendances were broken. The record for Test attendance at a match in England was broken three times, in the Second, Third and Fourth Tests, <b>and</b> <b>stands</b> to this day.|$|E
5|$|On 7 April 1967, the {{grandstand}} caught {{fire and the}} entire structure burned down beyond repair. The buildings <b>and</b> <b>stands</b> were subsequently demolished. At the same time, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration proposed that the Fetveien road, which runs {{to the south of}} the stadium, should be moved to run through the stadium, which would have required the stadium to be moved. However, the Public Roads Administration abandoned their plans and a building permit was issued. New changing rooms, club house and terraces were completed in September 1968.|$|E
5|$|Satan preaches from {{a raised}} earth mound and {{is dressed in}} {{clerical}} clothing {{that may be a}} soutane.

5|$|Stela 88 {{may have}} been paired with Stela 62. The {{monument}} has {{the image of a}} queen but her name is unknown. B'olon K'awiil also appears to be mentioned on the stela. It dates to around 751 <b>and</b> <b>stands</b> on the stairway of Structure 13. Stela 91 is another very late monument probably dating to the early 10th century. Like Stela 84, it bears an inscription that is a meaningless imitation of hieroglyphic writing.|$|E
5|$|The Glidden barn is of {{pole and}} beam construction. The second-floor {{interior}} {{is dominated by}} two large transverse wooden beams. It is of the three-bay, English tradition, the west bay containing a space for a stairwell leading to a hayloft and seven stalls. It is constructed of red brick <b>and</b> <b>stands</b> on a foundation of limestone. Glidden's barn took {{full advantage of the}} term vernacular; the brick was locally manufactured and the limestone locally quarried.|$|E

5|$|Tsakalotos is also {{a leading}} member of the Group of 53, a {{prominent}} faction within Syriza. One report names him {{as the leader of}} the Group. The Group was founded in mid-2014 <b>and</b> <b>stands</b> ideologically between the Left Platform and Alexis Tsipras's core backers. After the Left Platform split from Syriza to Popular Unity, the Group of 53 became the most left-wing faction within Syriza.|$|E
5|$|After seeing Tina in a dream, Rahul and {{his family}} go to Anjali's wedding, where Rahul silently confesses to Anjali that he loves her, and watches in tears as she is brought forth for the wedding. Realising this, Anjali is {{hesitant}} {{to go on with}} the marriage, <b>and</b> <b>stands</b> weeping. Aman notices the tears in her eyes and realises that she has always been in love with Rahul. He releases Anjali from the engagement and tells her to marry Rahul. Rahul and Anjali have an emotional hug and as the two marry, little Anjali Khanna sees a vision of Tina, who is smiling and giving her the thumbs up. Rahul and Anjali Sharma get married.|$|E
60|$|She {{passed out}} of the room. Saton went <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> before the low window. Slowly, and with hesitating footsteps, Lois came up the path, lifted the latch of the little gate, <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> in the garden, close to a tall group of hollyhocks.|$|R
5|$|<b>And</b> <b>stood</b> {{the test}} of time.|$|R
30|$|As long as {{sample size}} was > 1 and not {{excessive}} (generally < 30), the number of samples selected from the copula, and averaged to produce the DBH and HT growth estimates, had very little influence on model behavior <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> trajectories (not shown). A single sample produced extremely variable individual tree <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> trajectories. As sample size increased, the variability in individual tree <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> trajectories decreased. For all analyses shown in this paper, we used a sample size of 10 as a compromise between large variations in tree <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> development <b>and</b> smoothing out the variability completely. Sample size had much greater effect on ideotypes at the lowest densities and greatest Dq; however, trends were similar across {{the entire range of}} density and Dq.|$|R
5|$|As {{the singer}} walks through a forest, {{the father is}} shown resorting to {{drinking}} in grief. A funeral scene follows, showing the girl walking up to her mother's wake. When she sees her mother's lips sealed with thread, she runs away from the wake. Madonna walks through a house, where shadows show the girl being scolded and shouted at by the father. Ultimately she walks to the graveyard <b>and</b> <b>stands</b> beside an old man, implying that she herself is the little girl portrayed. The video ends with the little girl dancing {{in front of her}} mother's grave as snow falls around her.|$|E
5|$|As they {{stake out}} their territories and compete for females, males exhibit rivalry. When they clash, they {{face up to}} each other with bent knees and {{exchange}} horn thrusts. Elaborate individual displays are made during their rivalry and they may bellow, snort and dig their horns into the ground. Once dominance has been established, each male attempts to lure the female into his domain. During courtship, urination and low-stretch are common activities and the male soon attempts to mount the female. A receptive female holds her tail to one side <b>and</b> <b>stands</b> still while copulation takes place. Matings may be repeated several times and may take place twice or more times within a minute. The male neither eats nor rests when a female is present in his territory and during this time, the female keeps close to the male, often rubbing {{her head on his}} torso and sniffing his penis. While in season, a female may visit several territories and mate with several different males.|$|E
5|$|Both Mulder and Scully stumble {{down the}} stairs in hope of just getting outside to die. They meet up by the door, both {{crawling}} on the floor, covered in massive amounts of blood. Scully claims he shot her, while Mulder claims she shot him. Mulder realizes that {{that could not have}} happened <b>and</b> <b>stands</b> up. The illusion is broken, and the two leave the house. Maurice and Lyda sit by the fire, holding hands, saying that they almost had the two agents. Meanwhile, at Mulder's apartment, Mulder and Scully exchange gifts, even though they told each other they would not.|$|E

30|$|In studies about {{modeling}} LAI from stand parameters, Kashian et al. (2005) {{reported a}} significant but weak relationship between LAI or BAI <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> density (r 2 [*]<[*] 0.20) at stand ages characterized by canopy closure. DeRose et al. (2010) developed some nonlinear regression equations, which indicated that LAI {{was significantly related}} to relative density, site quality, <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> top height, <b>and</b> concluded that LAI increased nonlinearly with increasing relative density holding stand top height constant. Sidabras and Augustaitis (2015) found indirect relationships between LAI <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> mean diameter <b>and</b> height in a multi-aged mixture of coniferous forest, while they found no significant relationships between LAI <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> sum square basal area. In the same study, the authors found a significant relationship between LAI <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> density <b>and</b> volume of the pure pine forest stands. Dantec et al. (2000) found that there were significant relationships between LAI <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> basal area <b>and</b> number of trees of stands. Özbayram et al. (2015) reported positive correlations between LAI <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> age, mean diameter, top height, green tree height, basal area, and litter in Turkish red pine stands, but negative correlation between LAI <b>and</b> <b>stand</b> age <b>and</b> mean diameter in black pine stands. The ANN models have been used for predicting LAI from remotely sensed data, for example, Bacour et al. (2006), Shoemaker and Cropper (2008), Verger et al. (2008), Omer et al. (2016), and Wang et al. (2017). Beyond these studies about the LAI predictions from the remote sensing data by the ANN models, the present study has underlined that the ANN models may be used alternatively to traditional regression techniques for predicting LAI predictions from terrestrial measurements such as some stand parameters.|$|R
