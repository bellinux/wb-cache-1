5|$|Genetics is {{believed}} {{to be involved in the}} majority of cases, either directly or indirectly. Some epilepsies <b>are</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a single gene defect (1–2%); most <b>are</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors. Each of the single gene defects is rare, with more than 200 in all described. Most genes involved affect ion channels, either directly or indirectly. These include genes for ion channels themselves, enzymes, GABA, and G protein-coupled receptors.|$|E
50|$|A {{review of}} common factors {{research}} in 2008 suggested that 30% to 70% {{of the variance}} in therapy outcome <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> common factors. A summary of research in 2014 suggested that 11.5% of variance in therapy outcome <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the common factor of goal consensus/collaboration, 9% <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> empathy, 7.5% <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> therapeutic alliance, 6.3% <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> positive regard/affirmation, 5.7% <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> congruence/genuineness, and 5% <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> therapist factors; in contrast, treatment method accounted for roughly 1% of outcome variance.|$|R

5|$|Most {{cases of}} SAH <b>are</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> trauma. In 85 {{percent of cases}} of {{spontaneous}} SAH, the cause is rupture of a cerebral aneurysm—a weakness in the wall {{of one of the}} arteries in the brain that becomes enlarged. They tend to be located in the circle of Willis and its branches. While most cases of SAH <b>are</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> bleeding from small aneurysms, larger aneurysms (which are less common) are more likely to rupture. Aspirin also appears to increase the risk.|$|E

5|$|Although 300 {{mutations}} of ATP7B {{have been}} described, in most populations {{the cases of}} Wilson's disease <b>are</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{a small number of}} mutations specific for that population. For instance, in Western populations the H1069Q mutation (replacement of a histidine by a glutamine at position 1069 in the protein) is present in 37–63% of cases, while in China this mutation is very uncommon and R778L (arginine to leucine at 778) is found more often. Relatively {{little is known about the}} relative impact of various mutations, although the H1069Q mutation seems to predict later onset and predominantly neurological problems, according to some studies.|$|E
5|$|Anterior cord syndrome, due {{to damage}} to the front portion of the spinal cord or {{reduction}} in the blood supply from the anterior spinal artery, {{can be caused by}} fractures or dislocations of vertebrae or herniated disks. Below the level of injury, motor function, pain sensation, and temperature sensation are lost, while sense of touch and proprioception (sense of position in space) remain intact. These differences <b>are</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the relative locations of the spinal tracts responsible for each type of function.|$|E

5|$|Any {{blood clot}} forms {{due to an}} {{imbalance}} between coagulation (the formation of the insoluble blood protein fibrin) and fibrinolysis. The three major mechanisms for such an imbalance are enumerated in Virchow's triad: alterations in normal blood flow, injury to the blood vessel wall, and alterations in the constitution of blood (hypercoagulability). Most cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis <b>are</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> hypercoagulability.|$|E
5|$|Armillaria gallica may {{itself be}} parasitized by other soil flora. Several {{species of the}} fungus Trichoderma, {{including}} Trichoderma polysporum, T.harzianum and T.viride, are able to attack and penetrate and the outer tissue of A.gallica rhizomorphs and parasitize the internal hyphae. The infected rhizomorphs become devoid of living hyphae about {{one week after the}} initial infection. Entoloma abortivum is another fungus that can live parasitically upon A.gallica. The whitish-gray malformed fruit bodies that may result <b>are</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the E.abortivum hyphae penetrating the mushroom and disrupting its normal development.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} species of bird lice, Colpocephalum cooki and Ciconiphilus temporalis have been found as ectoparasites. Healthy adult birds have no natural predators, and the only {{recorded}} causes of premature mortality <b>are</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the direct or indirect actions of humans; such as, poisoning, shooting, or electrocution when the birds accidentally fly into overhead electricity wires. Captive birds {{have been found to}} be susceptible to avian influenza (H5N1) and high mortality was noted at a facility in Cambodia, with two-thirds of infected birds dying. The longest recorded life span in captivity was 43 years.|$|E

5|$|Banksia oligantha {{is listed}} as an {{endangered}} species under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), and as rare under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. These rankings <b>are</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> its small and severely fragmented distribution, and the ongoing degradation of its habitat. Threats include grazing by sheep and rabbits, drought, the drift of aerosol chemicals from surrounding farmland, invasion by weeds, and rising salinity. Studies have shown it to be moderately susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback.|$|E

5|$|Brachiopods are shelled {{marine organisms}} that superficially resembled {{bivalves}} {{in that they}} are of similar size and have a hinged shell in two parts. However, brachiopods evolved from a very different ancestral line, and the resemblance to bivalves only arose because of a similar lifestyle. The {{differences between the two groups}} <b>are</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their separate ancestral origins. Different initial structures have been adapted to solve the same problems, a case of convergent evolution. In modern times, brachiopods are not as common as bivalves.|$|E

In newborns, CSF pressure ranges from 8 to 10 cmH2O (4.4–7.3mmHg or 0.78–0.98kPa). Most variations <b>are</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> coughing or internal compression of jugular veins in the neck.

The first two conditions involve a viral infection and are generally milder with respect to symptomatology; the last four <b>are</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> bacterial infection and are usually of greater severity.|$|E
5|$|Extracts of Narcissus have {{demonstrated}} {{a number of}} potentially useful biological properties including antiviral, prophage induction, antibacterial, antifungal, antimalarial, insecticidal, cytotoxic, antitumor, antimitotic, antiplatelet, hypotensive, emetic, acetylcholine esterase inhibitory, antifertility, antinociceptive, chronotropic, pheromone, plant growth inhibitor, and allelopathic. An ethanol extract of Narcissus bulbs was found effective in one mouse model of nociception, para-benzoquinone induced abdominal constriction, but not in another, the hot plate test. Most of these properties <b>are</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> alkaloids, but some are also due to mannosa-binding lectins.
