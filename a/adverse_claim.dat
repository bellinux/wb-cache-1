50|$|In {{questions}} concerning labor law and social justice, Makasiar's opinions for the Court reflected sympathies {{to the common}} man, and would sometimes resort in rebuke to injustices as reflected by {{the facts of the}} case. For example, in Carbonell v. CA, 69 SCRA 99(1976), Makasiar wrote: Hence, Carbonell's prior purchase of the land was made in good faith. Her good faith subsisted and continued to exist when she recorded her <b>adverse</b> <b>claim</b> four (4) days prior to the registration of Infante's deed of sale. Carbonell's good faith did not cease after Poncio told her on January 31, 1955 of his second sale of the same lot to Infante, Because of that information, Carbonell wanted an audience with Infante, which desire underscores Carbonell's good faith. With an aristocratic disdain unworthy of the good breeding of a good Christian and good neighbor, Infante snubbed Carbonell like a leper and refused to see her. So Carbonell did {{the next best thing to}} protect her right — she registered her <b>adverse</b> <b>claim</b> on February 8, 1955. Under the circumstances, this recording of her <b>adverse</b> <b>claim</b> should be deemed to have been done in good faith and should emphasize Infante's bad faith when she registered her deed of sale four (4) days later on February 12, 1955.|$|E

50|$|Second, the Court {{held that}} the plaintiff's title had been {{extinguished}} before the Mexican Cession. To determine this, the Court examined and quoted extensively the specific text of the plaintiff's grants. From this, the Court concluded that the aboriginal title had long been extinguished by abandonment:It thus appears that prior to the cession the Mexican authorities, upon examination, found that the Indians had abandoned the land; that the only <b>adverse</b> <b>claim</b> was vested in the mission of San Diego and made an absolute grant, subject only to the condition of satisfying whatever claims the mission might have.

40|$|The rule is {{that the}} {{necessity}} of a notice to quit is based on the relation of landlord and tenant, and where that relation does not exist, the notice to quit is not necessary. Therefore, it has been held that a mortgagor in possession, is not entitled to notice to quit, as he is 2 ̆ 2 at most a tenant at sufferance, and may be treated either as a tenant or trespasser, at the election of the mortgagee. 2 ̆ 2 And no notice to quit is necessary where one has taken possession under an <b>adverse</b> <b>claim.</b> So, where the tenant going into possession of the premises under the title of the landlord, afterwards disclaims, he has no right to insist on a notice to quit. At common law, a tenant at sufferance was not entitled to notice to quit. But it has been provided by statute in some of the States, that it shall be necessary to serve him with notice to quit. It is so provided in Missouri, where one month 2 ̆ 7 s notice is required, and in Wisconsin. But in Michigan, and in Oregon, the statute requires a notice of three months. This provision, requiring notice to be given to tenants at sufferance, has given rise to some troublesome questions...|$|E
40|$|Virtue ethics {{has been}} a major ethical theory from Antiquity to the present. Despite its {{persistence}} on the philosophical scene, in recent years (especially after the publication of After Virtue in 1981) it has been severely criticized for being open to the charge of relativism. In this thesis, I focus on Rosalind Hursthouse’s reconstruction of Aristotle’s enterprise. In the first chapter I examine her aspiration to explain right action solely in terms of the virtuousness of moral agents. Unless Hursthouse concedes, at least to some extent to the moral relativist, I conclude that {{it is not possible to}} articulate the rightness of action on a virtue-based account. Hursthouse also rejects the very existence of second order rules and principles which guide moral agents when moral virtues and their corresponding v-rules have an <b>adverse</b> <b>claim</b> upon us. I will demonstrate that Hursthouse’s rejection of the codifiability thesis, again, forces her to concede even more to moral relativism. The inability to fill the gap between the virtuousness of a moral agent and the rightness of her action is not the only aspect of Hursthouse’s version of virtue ethics that is open to relativism. She also fails to provide a viable procedure for validating moral virtues. In the second chapter, I concentrate on Hursthouse’s reconstruction of Aristotelian ethical naturalism which is one of the most significant attempts to ground moral virtues independently of any moral rules and principles. I demonstrate that the naturalistic validation of moral virtues is susceptible to the cultural context in which virtues are supposed to be validated. In the framework of ethical naturalism, we are social animals. When normative virtues are presumed to be based on our being, it is inevitable that our sociality, and thus our cultural background, permeates the naturalistic moral virtues...|$|E

40|$|The paper explores {{a problem}} thrown up by LRA 2002 Schedule 6 and the Act's {{provisions}} generally relating to changes concerning the law relating to <b>adverse</b> possession <b>claims</b> against registered titles. Under the LRA 2002 after 10 years adverse {{possession of a}} registered title a claimant for the same can apply to be registered as proprietor of the relevant land. The current registered owner is notified and is afforded the opportunity to object within certain time limits. If objection is made the adverse possessor applicant will only succeed in becoming the new registered proprietor on certain limited grounds. Due to the difficulty in succeeding the authors contend that de facto many adverse possessors of registered land do not bother applying to be registered and remain in adverse possession without making any application. This the authors contend indirectly revives the significance of possessory titles along with the issues relating to their usage, which ironically weakens the all important mirror principle the LRA 2002 was meant to strengthen. Empirical evidence {{is included in the}} paper which bears out the authors' contention in this regard. Law reform recommendations are then made so as to improve the relevant legal rules surrounding <b>adverse</b> possession <b>claims</b> against pre-existing registered titles...|$|R

However, the regulator said that because [...] "the link between human activity and global warming... became settled before March 2007", in parts 1-4 the audience was not [...] "materially misled so as to cause harm or offence".

25|$|The party seeking title by adverse {{possession}} {{may be called}} the disseisor, meaning one who dispossesses the true owner of the property. Although the elements of an <b>adverse</b> possession <b>claim</b> are different in each state, {{adverse possession}} requires at a minimum five basic conditions being met to perfect {{the title of the}} disseisor.
