The 3 GPP forum has however not standardized any MMSC provided supplementary services in relation to MMS. The goal of the thesis {{is to create a}} Front End (FE) prototype which is capable of supporting a given set of MMSC supplementary messaging services for MMS and to develop and test an MMSC. The set of supplementary messaging services to be supported are auto-reply to an MMS message, <b>auto-forwarding,</b> convert an email to a MMS message, and cloning a MMS message. The final results for the project are mixed. The prototype was not implemented entirely mainly due to lack of available software and not having access to an operators MMSC, which would be needed to push the supplementary services to mobile phones. However substantial progress was achieved. All of the supplementary messaging services were implemented and made compatible with Mobile Arts existing system. A testing system was also designed capable of processing simulated incoming MMS messages...|$|E

(If you have a personal account as well, you can set up an <b>auto-forward</b> of email from your University account: see the Help menu in your University mail.) • You should also check your pigeonhole and the Departmental noticeboards outside the General Office. • If you have a disability or long-term learning difficulty, make the University aware of any individual requirements necessary by contacting Academic Support. • Familiarise yourself with deadlines for assessments and assignments in all of the modules you are studying (and check the office opening times). • Notify the department as soon as possible if circumstances affect your ability to complete a module, assignment or assessment (including in-class work).
