40|$|This {{research}} has been performed in order to evaluate four different affinity coefficients with formulas, with the purpose to determine <b>achievement</b> <b>ratios</b> related to the omega grafting applied onto the 41 B, 140 R rootstock of the Red Globe grape variety which is commercially important grape variety in Lakes Region of Turkey. The study was done in Egirdir Fruit Research Station in Isparta city of Turkey. When the affinity values were statistically analyzed according to rootstocks and year, combinations was significantly evaluated and by evaluating 2012 and 2013 year's data consecutively, hopeful combinations were determined. It has been determined that 2013 years affinity coefficients and 140 R rootstock combination were slightly better than 2012 year and 41 B combination. It has been determined that evaluating only with the formulations {{is not sufficient to}} get an exact result by the determination of a good affinity. Therefore it is needed to continue studies in future for a long time growing. The results which were evaluated in this study and next years' studies results must be evaluated together when a stable affinity occurs, a final result and suggestion can be made about combinations.

40|$|Gamification in {{engineering}} {{education has been}} applied with success in the last years. Also, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are recognized as a good strategy to enhance engineering education. Nevertheless, MOOCs have two main weaknesses: first, lack of addressing personal goals; and second, low completion rates {{in comparison to the}} number of registrations to the MOOCs. To improve learning experiences in MOOCs and to strengthen self-regulated personalized learning we propose the application of gamification in MOOCs. Our assumption is that MOOC learners will better succeed in achieving their goals if they can individually personalize and plan their learning paths through gamification. This assumption is based on the implementation intention theory which claims that people who foster their goal intentions with implementation intentions are comparatively more successful in their personal goal achievements. Based on a preliminary literature review this article presents and arguments on our research idea on how to apply gamification to enhance MOOC users’ goal achievement.

40|$|AbstractThe unidirection {{composites}} of jute spun yarn/Polylactic acid were fabricated using compression molding. The reinforcement fibers were paralleled with matrix resin {{fiber and}} {{were used as}} intermediate materials to prepare the unidrection preforms. The parallel yarn was winded onto the metallic frame. The wound paralleled yarns were dried in convection oven before molding. The metallic frame containing the paralleled yarns was placed in heated mold for consolidation to produce the unidirection composite specimens with various molding temperature. The heated mold was cooled by the cooling system of the compression machine. Consolidation process involved three stages. At first, under certain temperature, the solid fibrous matrix materials became softened and then the matrix in the liquid form soaked and infiltrated the reinforcing fibers and finally during cooling stage, the matrix turned into solid form to hold the fibers in a definite position. The molding temperature was affected to the mechanical properties of the unidirection composite. The jute spun yarn/PLA composite were characterized in the term of mechanical properties and the fabrication quality was examined by cross-section observation. The impregnation quality and dispersion of fiber bundle were increased with increasing the molding temperature and <b>achievement</b> <b>ratio</b> of elastic modulus increase. While increasing the molding temperature, the <b>achievement</b> <b>ratio</b> of tensile strength was decreased because of deterioration of jute fiber.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Considerable {{evidence}} exists {{to suggest the}} notion that selected personality traits {{may be related to}} specific aspects of academic achievement. This study was directed toward the investigation of this relationship in the case of non-science majors enrolled in a college course in physical science. Personality was assessed with the California Psychological Inventory (CPI) and academic achievement was defined in terms of the subjects' performance on the examinations regularly administered for grading purposes in the course, i. e., the "midterm" and final examinations. Two aspects of academic achievement were measured by classifying all examination questions as either verbal or numerical. Examination questions were classified as "numerical" whenever the use of mathematics was a necessary requisite in selecting the correct response to an item, and verbal if they were not numerical. The population consisted of the students enrolled in the two sections of General Science 104 at Oregon State University during the fall term of 1966, The population was subdivided into four groups on the basis of sex and lecture section. Two hypotheses were tested {{in each of the four}} population subdivisions. A - There is no significant correlation between verbal achievement and personality; and there is no significant correlation between numerical achievement and personality. B - There is no significant correlation between the <b>ratio</b> of numerical <b>achievement</b> to verbal achievement and personality. In three out of four cases A was rejected, leading to the conclusion that personality and achievement in physical science are related. For males, five CPI scales correlated with achievement in physical science at the. 05 level. Four of them were related to verbal achievement and one was related to numerical achievement. Among the females, eleven significant correlation coefficients occurred between CPI scales and achievement in physical science. Six of them were related to verbal achievement and five to numerical achievement. B was accepted in all four null tests, but further interpretation of the results led to the conclusion that discrepant <b>achievement,</b> the <b>ratio</b> of numerical <b>achievement</b> to verbal achievement, is related to personality. The implications of this study relative to current public school science curricula were discussed. The need for further research based upon a theory of discrepant achievement was considered in light of its relevance to the problem of achievement in physical science...|$|R

We used data from a prospective, population-based UK cohort study, the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS). 5489 children from White ethnic background born at term in 2000 - 2001, attending school in England in 2006, were included in our analyses. Educational achievement was measured using the Foundation Stage Profile (FSP), a statutory assessment undertaken by teachers {{at the end of}} the child's first school year. Breastfeeding duration was ascertained from interviews with the mother when the child was 9 months old. We used modified Poisson's regression to model the association of breastfeeding duration with having reached a good level of achievement overall (≥ 78 overall points and ≥ 6 in 'personal, social and emotional development' and 'communication, language and literacy' points) and in specific areas (≥ 6 points) of development.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} if differences existed in perceptions expressed by selected eighth grade students concerning relations between personal academic achievement and influence of family encouragement and expectation. Three Indiana school corporations were selected to participate in the study. From school records of 1979 - 80 eighth graders, students were classified by specific criteria of intelligence and grade point average into three groups: (1) highly capable academic achievers, (2) average ability academic overachievers, (3) highly capable academic underachievers. Twenty-five students for each group were randomly selected, making a total of seventy-five students. The Questionnaire, developed by combining the. Brookover Scales with modified sections of the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale, was administered to small groups of selected students. Completed Questionnaires were computer processed using an analysis of variance to examine nine null hypotheses. The hypotheses compared expressed perceptions among the three groups concerning Family Encouragement and Expectation, Self-Concept, and Academic <b>Achievement.</b> A <b>ratio</b> of between group sum of squares and within group sum of squares provided an F value to determine significant difference of means between compared groups. Degrees of freedom were 1 and 48, used to determine the. 05 level of confidence. Data showed significant differences in expressed perceptions of personal academic achievement compared between highly capable achievers and average ability overachievers and between highly capable achievers and highly capable underachievers to reject two hypotheses. Seven hypotheses were not rejected. Data analysis showed significant mean differences for two of three groups comparing male and female responses. Highly capable achiever males and females showed no difference in perceptions for any area. Average ability overachiever males showed higher mean scores than females of the group in areas of Academic Achievement, Family Encouragement and Expectation, and Family Encouragement as isolated. Highly capable underachiever females showed higher mean scores than males of the group in areas of Self-Concept, Family Encouragement and Expectation, and Family Encouragement as isolated. Based on data, conclusions are: 1. Grade point average has no bearing on perceptions of students concerning family encouragement and expectation. Highly capable achievers show stronger family expectation than highly capable underachievers show. Average ability overachiever males indicate stronger family encouragement than females of the group. Highly capable underachiever females indicate stronger family encouragement than males of the group. 2. Grade point average is not related to personal self-concept. Within the highly capable underachiever group, females express higher self-concept than males. 3. Average ability overachievers identify with highly capable underachievers in personal academic achievement rather than with highly capable achievers. Within the average ability overachiever group, males feel more capable academically than females of the same group. Recommendations were made based on findings and conclusions: 1.

The study found a consistent and significant benefit of small classes for all students, with the greatest advantages for minority, inner-city students from low SES backgrounds. For grades 4 through 8, the Tennessee Department of Education provided researchers with standardized achievement test scores, which were then matched to the appropriate STAR cohorts and compared for significant differences. Results through grade 8 showed that those students who were in small classes during K- 3 continued to score significantly higher on standardized achievement tests than their peers who had attended regular classes or regular classes with a teacher aide. However, at grade 9 statistically significant results did not emerge, which was attributed to the statewide testing procedures that were {{in place for the}} ninth-graders.

The study examined: (1) small classes of 13 to 17 students per teacher; (2) regular classes of 22 to 25 students per teacher; and (3) regular classes with a teacher's aide. The sample included students from kindergarten through third grade at inner-city, rural, urban, and suburban schools. Results showed achievement benefits for students from small classes over students from the other classes. A Lasting Benefits Study (LBS) is being conducted to determine if these achievement gains are maintained in later grades. This report discusses the LBS findings for fifth grade students. A standardized test battery measured the achievement in reading, language, math, science, and social studies of 4, 649 students {{who had participated in}} Project STAR. Results indicated that students who had been in a Project STAR small class showed statistically significant advantages over students in the other class types on all achievement measures.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 This {{investigation}} {{was designed to}} determine the extent to which students who are completing planned curricula in science education are proficient in aspects of critical thinking, and possess understandings of science consistent with those of the practicing scientist. The effects of science curricula upon the development of these abilities and understandings were examined by comparing group mean test scores of science teacher-candidates to those of (a) freshmen in social science education, (b) science education freshmen, (c) elementary teacher-candidates, (d) social science teacher-candidates, and (e) in-service science teachers represented by Academic Year Institute Participants. Subgroups of science teacher-candidates were compared in order to assess further the effect of science curricula upon the development of critical thinking ability and understanding of science. Criterion tests were the Cornell Critical Thinking Test, Form X, and the Test on Understanding Science, Form W. The study being of a post-test only design, the criterion instruments were administered to the freshmen and in-service teachers at the beginning of Fall Term 1964. Teacher-candidates completed these tests during the term that they were enrolled in their respective special teaching methods courses. Single classification analyses of covariance using CCTT and TOUS group means were employed to statistically test the null hypotheses. Combined verbal and mathematical subtest means on the Scholastic Aptitude Test were applied as covariance controls of scholastic aptitude while group mean accumulative grade point averages were similarly used to control for group differences in academic <b>achievement.</b> F <b>ratios</b> were computed and evaluated to determine whether differences in group means on the criterion instruments were significant. The data were further analyzed to determine correlations among the variables and to assess prevalent misunderstandings of science. FINDINGS The following conclusions were drawn from the data analyzed in this investigation: 1. Both critical thinking abilities and understanding of science by the science teacher-candidates were significantly (five percent level) greater than were those of freshmen in social science education, freshmen in science education, elementary teacher-candidates, and in-service science teachers. 2. Science teacher-candidates did not differ significantly from social science teacher-candidates in either critical thinking ability or in understanding of science. 3. Neither critical thinking ability nor understanding of science, as measured by the criterion tests, were major learning outcomes of the study of college science. This conclusion was based on: a) Negative or non-significant correlations between both CCTT and TOUS scores and the total number of science grade points earned by members of each group. b) Lack of a significant difference in critical thinking ability or in understanding of science between science teacher-candidates and social science teacher-candidates, the latter group having completed half as many credits in science as had the former. c) Failure to find a significant difference in either critical thinking ability or understanding of science between high and low subgroups of science teacher-candidates selected on each of the following bases: 1) Total number of science grade points earned. 2) The biological-physical science ratio of science credits completed. 4. Science teacher-candidates evidenced an understanding of science superior to that of groups of students similar to those which they would be expected to teach. 5. Science teacher-candidates and in-service science teachers evidenced several misconceptions of the nature of science and scientists as did the non-science oriented groups. 6. Although all the groups revealed misunderstandings of the nature of scientific models, hypotheses, theories, and laws, these misunderstandings were significantly more numerous for the groups whose members had studied relatively little college science...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the article}}. The {{aim of the}} article is to develop {{scientific}} and methodic grounds to form motivational constituent of the international ecological policy. The results of the analysis. Directions to improve activity and efficiency of the international ecological policy consist in improvement or change of the existing elements in natural management mechanism, forms and tools of ecopolicy. Therefore motivating mechanism of environmental protection and rational natural management has prior value. One of the main points to form motivating tools system has to be increasing of the economic activity total efficiency in the country. Its <b>achievement</b> depends on <b>ratio</b> between change in efficiency of the ecodestructive and ecologically oriented innovative activity. Authors present graphically and ground possible variants of innovative activity efficiency while using economic motivating tools of its ecologization. Authors also suggest to use curve, which describes inequality of ecodestructive impact distinguish, to determine perspectives for innovative activity ecologization motivating creation in the country. The proposed methodic approach is used only to analyze enterprises ecological compatibility, which has destructive impact on environment. Inequality coefficient is suggested to measure degree of ecodestructive impact distinguish inequality degree. Authors investigated principle scheme to define potential of innovative activity ecologization motivating depending on the received inequality coefficient of the ecodestructive impact distinguish and type of the distinguish curve. In order to avoid subjectivity of ecodestructive impact distinguish curve one suggests to use formalized procedure, which foresees determination of distinguish curve type by results of shifting coefficient calculation. In order to form efficient system of the innovative activity ecologization motivating one proposes to use developed map of the relative socio-ecology-economic efficient to use methods of negative and positive motivating of the innovative activity ecologization of branch, region and country enterprises, investigated by authors. The revealed dependence of motivating methods on these maps depending on inequality curve type of the enterprise ecodestructive impact distinguish and their innovative activity ecologization potential allow to determine prior methods of the ecologization motivating. If positive and negative motivating methods are greatly differ from each other by their use efficiency according to these maps, {{it is necessary to}} give advantage to those ones, which are more efficient. The suggested theoretical and methodic approach to estimate potential of innovative activity ecologization state motivating methods may be also adapted to solve other tasks to control innovative activity ecologization. To determine motivating tools one has to calculate expected results of its conduct. The main orienting point to motivate innovative activity ecologization {{from the point of view}} of state has to be socio-ecology-economic efficiency and proper effect. Conclusions and perspectives for further studies. Integral results of the conducted research are to improve conceptual assumptions to control natural management system in the part of international ecological policy formation, based on motivational approach. Practical value of the received results consists in the fact that owing to suggested scientific and methodic approaches to estimate motivational component in the ecological policy of the country one can increase efficiency of the management system in the natural management sphere and environmental protection. Thus, author’s assumptions allow to investigate theoretical and methodic approach in further studies to estimate negative and positive methods efficiency of the innovative activity ecologization depending on coefficients of the ecodestructive impact distinguish curve shifting and ecodestructive impact distinguish inequality...|$|R
40|$|Diameter class {{distribution}} data, {{as well as}} {{diameter increment}} and increased number of trees, {{provide a basis for}} the simulation of stand development. With advances in computer technology, modelling and stand development research has shown increasing importance. The objective {{of this paper is to}} explore the establishment dynamics of a selection stand structure in mixed beech-fir forest on Papuk. In the past, these forests were managed as even-aged forests. The research was carried out in the Management Unit »Zapadni Papuk Zvečevački«, Kamenska Forest Office. Using the data from forest management plans (plans of 2006, 1996 and 1986), ten stands were selected for which dynamics simulation of conversion into uneven-age stands was performed. The stands were selected on the basis of age, tree diameter distribution, density and mixture. After simulation, sub-compartments 34 b, 42 b and 56 a were selected for display. The data for these stands are shown in Table 1. Theoretical growing stock models for mixed fir and beech stands were designed according to Klepac (1961). Felling dimensions for both species were 60 cm, while the growing stock mixture consisted of 60 % fir and 40 % beech (as set down in the management plan). The theoretical model was designed for both site class combinations: fir II/III – beech II, and fir III – beech II/III, using the original theoretical models by Klepac. To calculate the growing stock, we used local one-entry volume tables by species and site classes from the management plan. Table 2 and 3 show the designed theoretical models. Simulations were carried out with Excel files generated for this purpose. Input data for the simulation consisted of diameter distribution of trees taken from the management plan. Consequently, diameter distribution of trees for all coniferous was displayed as fir and all deciduous trees as beech. Simulation was carried out according to three scenarios, which define the felling volume as follows:Scenario 1 : Felling volume is calculated according to Klepac’s formula. Scenario 2 : Volume of the first three felling is calculated on the basis of maximally allowed felling intensity of 30 % of the growing stock. After this, Scenario 1 is applied. Scenario 3 : Felling volume is calculated as the difference between the actual growing stock before felling and the theoretical growing stock after felling. The simulations were carried out for the time interval of 100 years. The results presented in Fig. 2 show long-lasting establishment of an uneven stand structure in the stands with initially too large growing stock and lack of small diameter trees. In all the three scenarios, the beech approaches the theoretical model more rapidly than the fir, particularly in smaller tree diameter classes. Assumed <b>achievement</b> of mixture <b>ratio</b> to the theoretical one led to the faster decrease of the large firs. According to all the tree scenarios, the growing stock is reduced below the theoretical one (Fig. 3), but after this it begins to increase. In Scenario 1, this decrease is smaller, but longer-lasting than in the other two scenarios, which is the consequence of lower felling intensities in the first 50 years. Scenario 2 assumes the largest reduction in the growing stock, when a total of 30 % of initial growing stock is felled in the first three selection felling cycles. The actual growing stock just before the fourth felling amounts to 87 % of the theoretical one. In our opinion, the growing stock can be reduced so as not to fall below 70 % of the theoretical growing stock. According to Scenario 3, extreme felling intensity in the year 2013 is the consequence of too large growing stock. The mixture ratio approaches more or less linearly the theoretical one. In such stands there should be several intensive fellings, as is the case in Scenario 2, provided that the interval of the actual mixture ratio approaching the theoretical one is longer. This would allow for earlier felling of mature fir trees, especially if the loss of their quality is a matter of concern. This would also intensify the appearance of young trees. According to Scenario 1, a specified volume of the first felling is 151 m 3 /ha, according to Scenario 2 it is 149 m 3 /ha and according to Scenario 3 it amounts to 193 m 3 /ha. For the same stand, Zelić (2003) points out that the felling volume could be 104 m 3 /ha and 107 m 3 /ha, respectively. The ten-year volume increment based on the management plan for this stand is 107 m 3 /ha and the felling quantity is only 73 m 3 /ha (68 % increment), which is 17 % based on the actual growing stock at the moment of measurement. Such low felling volume, if achieved, will cause further decline of the stand structure and slow down the process of its conversion into the selection stand structure. According to the results shown in Fig. 4, the selection stand structure is established much earlier in stands that do not contain too large growing stock and that initially have trees in smaller diameter classes. Considering that the initial growing stock is slightly lower than the theoretical one (Fig. 5), according to Scenario 1 and 3 it begins to rise in proportion with increased felling intensity. Similarly to the stand mentioned above, Scenario 2 leads to a significant reduction in the growing stock in comparison to the theoretical one. For this reason, felling intensity in the fourth felling treatment is significantly lower. Such stands require 2 – 3 more intensive felling treatments in the beginning, as is the case with Scenario 2. This would intensify regeneration and transition of young trees into higher diameter classes. According to the simulation results for sub-compartment 42 b (Fig. 6), the procedure of converting young stands into the selection stand structure is relatively fast. The biggest problem with these stands relates to the low mean diameter of felled trees (about 20 cm for fir and 15 cm for beech). As for the low initial growing stock, it rises in all the three scenarios (Fig. 7). The biggest initial growth is related to Scenario 3 as the consequence of the absence of felling in the year 2015, because the simulated felling volume was less than 0. Scenarios 1 and 3 are appropriate for such stands. The percentage of annual volume increment given in the management plan based on management classes is 2. 76 %, whereas the prescribed ten year felling volume is 20. 2 %. Such low felling volumes will slow down the establishment of the selection stand structure. The results of this research show that the establishment of the selection stand structure is a long process that depends on its initial stage. This is in accordance with earlier results of selection stand simulation in stands with disturbed structure (Čavlović et al. 2006 a, Čavlović et al. 2006 b, Čavlović and Božić 2007 – 08), or in stands which were converted from even-aged (spruce) into uneven-aged stands (Hanewinkel and Pretsch 2000). Relative to the stands on Papuk, Zelić (2003) writes: »a part of the stands intended for selective stand management are over 80 years old; consequently, management of these stands should aim at converting them into selection stand management in short time (30 – 50 years) «. The management plan states that it will take at least 30 years to establish theoretical selection stand structure. The results of this research show that the process will take even longer, which coincides with Šafar’s (1963) writing: »Often it takes more than half a century for a stand to form a new structure. Every conversion from one form into another that occurs too fast is harmful because attempts to rapidly create different structures are detrimental to those trees which provide good increment«. The biggest problem of establishing the selection stand structure in stands that lack small diameter trees is the fact that it takes sometimes more than 40 years for the seedlings to emerge and reach the diameter of 10 cm (see the transition times in Fig. 1). Observing just the part of the stand above 10 cm in diameter with the theoretical model reveals additional degradation of the structure. Considering that the young growth does not occur over the whole area simultaneously, the time needed to achieve the theoretical recruitment is even longer. In order to accelerate the process of natural regeneration, group selection system is recommended wherever possible. Provided that intensive and timely tending treatments are applied in groups of trees below 10 cm diameter, the recruitment will be more intensive (Cestar 1960, Špalj 1962). The size of the tree group depends on site conditions and ecological requirements of particular tree species, especially in terms of their shade tolerance (Šafar 1963, Nyland 1998). We are aware of the fact that, with the passing of time, the actual stand structure in the field will more or less diverge from the simulated and theoretical model, among other things because felling is not predicted for diameter classes with insufficient number of trees. In addition, the prediction of recruitment, particularly for longer periods, is never accurate...|$|R
