6000|$|... "I {{have come}} through it, nevertheless," [...] Malcolm said; [...] "but {{it is a long}} story, colonel, and I would <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>first</b> if the king has learned what Tilly is doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is a question, miss," [...] {{she said}} at last, abruptly, [...] "I should like to <b>ask</b> <b>you.</b> I should have <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> when <b>you</b> <b>first</b> came, if I had been in {{when you came to}} look at the rooms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't deny it. It {{was my idea}} to a tee. But I wouldn't {{have done}} it without <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> <b>first,</b> and seeing how you feel about it, I won't even <b>ask</b> <b>you.</b> But you thought a heap of that mare, and it's pretty hard on you to lose her. I'm sure sorry. And I'm sorry, too, that you won't be riding with me tomorrow. I'll be plumb lost. I won't {{know what to do with}} myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, not yet; I wish to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> {{something}} <b>first.</b> Arthur says he {{will come}} down {{as soon as he}} gets my reply. And--I should like Captain Horton to come with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do {{what you}} like with me,' said the girl, turning to the men again; 'but do what I <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>first,</b> and I ask you to give this message for God Almighty's sake.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>first,</b> Mr. Holmes, {{to glance}} at this rough plan, which {{will give you a}} general idea of the {{position}} of the professor's study and the various points of the case. It will help you in following my investigation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} ready to {{tell you all about}} it, mother; but, as one good turn deserves another, I shall <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>first</b> to answer me a few {{questions}} about the ownership of this house, and cove, and orchard. When you have told your story, I am ready to tell mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By telling me--; but I must <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> my {{question}} <b>first.</b> <b>You</b> and Fanny Clavering are dear friends now. You {{tell each other}} everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No blame can {{possibly}} attach to you, my dear sir," [...] he continued, {{in his most}} amiable manner. [...] "Will it be indiscreet, on my part, if I <b>ask</b> how <b>you</b> <b>first</b> became acquainted with Miss Jethro?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! ha!" [...] laughed Nigel, {{in a sort}} {{of desperate}} amusement, [...] "I--I--Yes, I will <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> Winnie! But <b>first</b> I must explain--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Not altogether, sir. I think I {{could work}} out the {{latitude}} and longitude if I knew something about a quadrant, but I have never seen one, and {{have no idea of}} its use. But what I wanted to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>first</b> of all was the meaning of some of these words which I cannot find in the dictionary.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>first</b> the purport of this interview," [...] said Carroll, curtly, [...] "before I prolong it further. You {{have asked}} me to come here in {{reference}} to certain letters I returned to their rightful owner some months ago. If you seek to reclaim them again, or to refer to a subject which must remain forgotten, I decline to proceed further." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{meal was}} over and the blue cigar smoke curled about us, when I turned to Gordon: [...] "There are two things I should like to <b>ask</b> <b>you.</b> <b>First,</b> and because I know what losses you have had to face, how you raised the money to {{liberate}} me in the generous way you did; and, second, how many acres are left unsown at Crane Valley?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{as little}} {{power to do}} one as I have desire to do the other. I came in great part to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> a question. <b>First,</b> your {{decision}} is irrevocable?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know not}} how to preface what I want to say," [...] Luca began, looking about him confusedly. [...] "May I <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> in the <b>first</b> place, if the work-girl named Nanina was here yesterday?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suggestive, or not," [...] {{interrupted}} John, [...] "we {{are most}} grateful to Monsieur Poirot for elucidating the matter. But for him, {{we should never}} have known of this will. I suppose, I may not <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> monsieur, what <b>first</b> led <b>you</b> to suspect the fact?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The boys {{said you}} {{let me go to}} the Temple all I want to; but I told them the Miracle was different, and I'd have to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>first.</b> I told Mis' Hingston, and I told the boys. Me 'n' Benny got them to come round. Kin I, mother? Mis' Hingston thought may be--may be--you might come yourself. But I told her I didn't believe you would." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My cousin {{asked me}} to bring him, or I shouldn't have taken the liberty. He seemed to want very much to come; you know he's awfully sociable. I told him I wanted to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>first,</b> but he said Mrs. Penniman had invited him. He isn't {{particular}} what he says {{when he wants to}} come somewhere! But Mrs. Penniman seems to think it's all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{this the}} other burst out a-laughing. [...] "Indeed," [...] says he, [...] "you are a cool blade, and a chip {{of the old}} block. But harkee, young gentleman," [...] and here he fell serious again. [...] "This is too weighty a {{business}} to chance any mistake in a name. I believe that you are, as you say, Mr. Barnaby True; but, nevertheless, to make perfectly sure, I must <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>first</b> to show me a note that you have about you and which you are instructed to show to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{matter what}} it involves. <b>You</b> don't <b>ask</b> what the X-ray involves; <b>you</b> <b>ask,</b> <b>first</b> of all, is it a fact? If the girl has these powers, then what? You don't even know what she claims, do you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fairy hell! I {{seen them}} eggs. Gautereaux's his name--a whackin' big, blue-eyed French-Canadian husky. He <b>asked</b> for <b>you</b> <b>first,</b> then {{took me to}} the side and jabbed me {{straight}} to the heart. It was our cornerin' eggs that got him started. He knowed about them three thousan' at Forty Mile an' just went an' got 'em. 'Show 'em to me,' I says. An' he did. There was his dog-teams, an' a couple of Indian drivers, restin' down the bank where they'd just pulled in from Forty Mile. An' on the sleds was soap-boxes--teeny wooden soap-boxes.|$|R
60|$|Two favours I want to <b>ask</b> of <b>you.</b> <b>First,</b> I wish <b>you</b> to get 'Pioneering in New Guinea,' by J. Chalmers. It's {{a missionary}} book, and has less pretensions to be {{literature}} than Spurgeon's sermons. Yet I think even through that, {{you will see}} some of the traits of the hero that wrote it; a man that took me fairly by storm for the most attractive, simple, brave, and interesting man in the whole Pacific. He is away now to go up the Fly River; a desperate venture, it is thought; he is quite a Livingstone card.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! I {{am glad to}} {{find you}} without George," [...] Bob said; [...] "'cause I {{want to talk to}} you. Look here! the men in all the shops have made a {{subscription}} to give you and George a present. Everyone feels that it's your doing that we have not got to idle all this winter, and when someone started the idea there wasn't a man in the two shops that didn't agree with him. I am the treasurer, I am, and it's come to just thirty pounds. Now I don't know what you two boys would like, whether you would like it in money, or whether you would like it in something else, so I thought I would <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>first.</b> I thought you would know what George would like, seeing what friends you are, and then you know it would {{come as a surprise to}} him. Now, what do you say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I've {{something}} to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>first,</b> {{something that may}} take some time." [...] He saw now that her embarrassment had really not been resentful; it had been nervous, tremulous, as the emotion of an unexpected pleasure might have been. [...] "That's really why I determined last night, without asking your leave first to pay you this little visit--that and the intense desire for another bout of horse-play with Sidney. Oh, I've come to see you," [...] Peter Baron went on, [...] "and I won't make any secret {{of the fact that}} I expect you to resign yourself gracefully to the trial and give me all your time. The day's lovely, and I'm ready to declare that the place is as good as the day. Let me drink deep of these things, drain the cup like a man who hasn't been out of London for months and months. Let me walk with you and talk with you and lunch with you--I go back this afternoon. Give me all your hours in short, so that they may live in my memory as one of the sweetest occasions of life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When we met, I said to him:--I have a last favour {{to ask of}} you. When we parted years ago, I {{had high}} hopes and brave resolutions--both are worn out. I then {{believed}} that I could not only rise superior to my misfortune, but could make that very misfortune the motive of my rise. You told me I was too quick of temper, too morbidly sensitive about the slightest reference to my father's death, too fierce and changeable under undeserved trial and disappointment. This might have been true then; but I am altered now: pride and ambition have been persecuted and starved out of me. An obscure, monotonous life, in which thought and spirit may be laid asleep, never to wake again, is the only life I care for. Help me to lead it. I <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> <b>first,</b> as a beggar, to give me from your superfluity, apparel decent enough to bear the daylight. I ask you next, to help me to some occupation which will just give me my bread, my shelter, and my hour or two of solitude in the evening. You have plenty of influence to do this, and you know I am honest. You cannot choose me too humble and obscure an employment; let me descend low enough to be lost to sight beneath the world I have lived in; let me go among {{people who want to}} know that I work honestly for them, and want to know nothing more. Get me a mean hiding-place to conceal myself and my history in for ever, and then neither attempt to see me nor communicate with me again. If former friends chance to ask after me, tell them I am dead, or gone into another country. The wisest life is the life the animals lead: I want, like them, to serve my master for food, shelter, and liberty to lie asleep now and then in the sunshine, without being driven away as a pest or a trespasser. Do you believe in this resolution?--it is my last.|$|E
6000|$|... "Una, my child," [...] he said, fixing {{his eyes}} on mine, [...] "I hardly know whether I can ever make you {{understand}} all that. I must <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> at <b>first</b> at least just simply to believe me. I must <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to trust me and to accept my account. When you rushed upon me as I stood there, all entangled in that hateful apparatus, and unable to move, I didn't know where you had been; I didn't know how you'd come there. But I felt sure you must have heard at least your false father's last words--that he'd stifle me with the chloroform and burn my body up afterwards to ashes with his chemicals. You seized the pistol before I could quite recover {{from the effects of}} the fumes. He lay dead at my feet before I realised what was happening.|$|R
6000|$|... "You needn't {{imply that}} I {{like it to}} be in the dark. I would like to walk with you in broad day past all the houses in Leatherwood. But I don't suppose you'd let me." [...] She did not say anything, and he added, [...] "I'm going to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to the <b>first</b> chance." [...] Still she did not say anything, though her father had fallen behind and left the talk wholly to them.|$|R
6000|$|He came {{straight}} to the point. [...] "Martineau," [...] he said, [...] "I must have those drugs I <b>asked</b> <b>you</b> for when <b>first</b> I came to you now. I must be bolstered up. I can't last out unless I am. I'm {{at the end of}} my energy. I come to you because you will understand. The Commission can't go on now for more than another three weeks. Whatever happens afterwards I must keep going until then." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "In {{respect of}} these standards, and with {{concern for the}} future of the University of KwaZulu-Natal in the worlds of {{scientific}} and humanistic learning and research, we respectfully <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> <b>first,</b> to reconsider the process you have proposed; second, to restate the Universitys commitment to academic freedom, including the rights of academic staff to review, criticize, and debate the policies and directions of their institutions; and, third, to reaffirm the Universitys commitment to standards of university governance consonant with the standards recognized by the UNESCO Statement of 11 November 1997." ...|$|E
40|$|Anthropology Now, {{a general}} {{interest}} peer-refereed publication, is published {{three times a}} year in April, Sep-tember, and December. Each issue contains feature articles about current anthropology research, plus surveys of new research projects, essays, interviews, photo essays, poetry, and book, film, and exhibit reviews {{on a wide range of}} topics of interest to anthropologists, students, and the interested public. SUBMISSIONS All submissions are peer reviewed and processed electronically. We’re looking for essays that are relatively short (3, 000 words), fascinating, addressed to a general audience, and engaged in contemporary problems. There should be minimal jargon, few, if any references, and the essay should be shaped as a narrative. Readers’ attention should be grabbed quickly with a hook—be very clear about what is interesting, important, and un-usual in what you have to say. If you are interested in submitting a manuscript, we <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> <b>first</b> to submit a one-page pitch for your proposed material. Briefly identify the argument you would like to advance, and tell us why it is important for the general public to understand.

6000|$|He fixed {{me for a}} {{long time}} without {{replying}} and then spoke with a weak extravagance and with such pauses between his words as might have represented the slow prompting of an inner voice. [...] "You <b>asked</b> me when <b>you</b> <b>first</b> knew me what I was. 'Nothing,' I said, 'nothing of any consequence.' Nothing I've always supposed myself to be. But I've wronged myself--I'm a great exception. I'm a haunted man!" ...|$|R
40|$|MJ: I’m {{going to}} begin my {{questions}} by <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> about that <b>first</b> letter that Yvonne Johnson wrote introducing herself. In the parts you quote {{in the beginning of}} Stolen Life she asks for help researching her family’s past and her ancestry. In that first letter there is no mention at all about writing her life story. So that’s what I’d like to ask. How did that initial request for help tracing her ancestry change to the writing of her own life story...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't help it--I don't {{want to be}} morbid. Do <b>you</b> {{remember}} my <b>asking</b> <b>you</b> about God?--the <b>first</b> day this began? and whether you had a god? Well, that's the trouble with us all to-day, we haven't any God, we're wanderers, drifters. And now it's just life that's got hold of us, my dear, and swept us away together. That's our justification--if we needed one--it's been too strong for us." [...] She {{leaned back against the}} tree and closed her eyes. [...] "We're like chips in the torrent of it, Hugh."....|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} see you {{yesterday}} evening," [...] he began, [...] "as I was learning from the Governor {{the state of the}} stores here. I should like to have a talk with <b>you.</b> May I <b>ask</b> <b>you,</b> in the <b>first</b> place, how <b>you</b> have so early attained the rank of captain? My aide-de-camp tells me that you said you had attracted the notice of the King of France. It must have been by some singular action, and as I have an hour to spare, before I ride out, I shall be glad if you can tell me some particulars about yourself; unless, indeed, they are of a private nature." ...|$|R
