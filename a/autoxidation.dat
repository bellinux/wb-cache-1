5|$|Although {{dopamine}} {{is normally}} {{broken down by}} an oxidoreductase enzyme, it is also susceptible to oxidation by direct reaction with oxygen, yielding quinones plus various free radicals as products. The rate of oxidation can be increased {{by the presence of}} ferric iron or other factors. Quinones and free radicals produced by <b>autoxidation</b> of dopamine can poison cells, and there is evidence that this mechanism may contribute to the cell loss that occurs in Parkinson's disease and other conditions.|$|E
5|$|In rodents and primates, {{sufficiently}} {{high doses}} of amphetamine cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity, or damage to dopamine neurons, which is characterized by dopamine terminal degeneration and reduced transporter and receptor function. There {{is no evidence that}} amphetamine is directly neurotoxic in humans. However, large doses of amphetamine may indirectly cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity as a result of hyperpyrexia, the excessive formation of reactive oxygen species, and increased <b>autoxidation</b> of dopamine. Animal models of neurotoxicity from high-dose amphetamine exposure indicate that the occurrence of hyperpyrexia (i.e., core body temperature≥40°C) is necessary for the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. Prolonged elevations of brain temperature above 40°C likely promote the development of amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity in laboratory animals by facilitating the production of reactive oxygen species, disrupting cellular protein function, and transiently increasing blood–brain barrier permeability.|$|E

25|$|Cholesterol is {{susceptible}} to oxidation and easily forms oxygenated derivatives known as oxysterols. Three different mechanisms can form these: <b>autoxidation,</b> secondary oxidation to lipid peroxidation, and cholesterol-metabolizing enzyme oxidation. A great interest in oxysterols arose when they were shown to exert inhibitory actions on cholesterol biosynthesis. This finding {{became known as the}} “oxysterol hypothesis”. Additional roles for oxysterols in human physiology include their participation in bile acid biosynthesis, function as transport forms of cholesterol, and regulation of gene transcription.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>autoxidation</b> of {{p-xylene}} {{is known}} to proceed through a free radical process. Mn(III) and Co(III) alone are not strong enough oxidizers to start the radical chain reaction, but instead initiate it by forming bromine radicals from the ions in solution. These bromine radicals then decompose hydroperoxides that are ligated to the metals as well as abstract hydrogens from the methyl groups on p-xylene to form free radicals and propagate the reaction. The following are the proposed initiation, propagation and terminations steps {{for the first of}} four oxidations involved in the auto-oxidation: ...|$|E
2500|$|Apomorphine is {{reported}} to be an inhibitor of amyloid beta protein (Aβ) fiber formation and a potential therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease (AD) under the amyloid hypothesis. [...] Apomorphine and its small molecule relatives are found to promote oligomerization of the Aβ40 group of molecules, but inhibit the more advanced fibril formation from occurring. [...] The mechanism of protection offered by the small molecules is thought to be due to the <b>autoxidation</b> that occurs at the hydroxyl groups. [...] Once this functional group was altered, the inhibitory effect could be seen to decrease, reducing either the indirect or direct interference of the fibril formation.|$|E
2500|$|Today, {{hydrogen}} peroxide is manufactured almost exclusively by the anthraquinone process, which was formalized in 1936 and patented in 1939. It {{begins with the}} reduction of an anthraquinone (such as 2-ethylanthraquinone or the 2-amyl derivative) to the corresponding anthrahydroquinone, typically by hydrogenation on a palladium catalyst; the anthrahydroquinone then undergoes <b>autoxidation</b> to regenerate the starting anthraquinone, with {{hydrogen peroxide}} as a by-product. Most commercial processes achieve oxidation by bubbling compressed air through a solution of the derivatized anthracene, whereby the oxygen present in the air reacts with the labile hydrogen atoms (of the hydroxy groups), giving hydrogen peroxide and regenerating the anthraquinone. Hydrogen peroxide is then extracted, and the anthraquinone derivative is reduced back to the dihydroxy (anthracene) compound using hydrogen gas {{in the presence of}} a metal catalyst. [...] The cycle then repeats itself.|$|E
2500|$|Some nonerythroid cells (i.e., cells {{other than}} the red blood cell line) contain hemoglobin. In the brain, these include the A9 dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, astrocytes in the {{cerebral}} cortex and hippocampus, and in all mature oligodendrocytes. It {{has been suggested that}} brain hemoglobin in these cells may enable the [...] "storage of oxygen to provide a homeostatic mechanism in anoxic conditions, which is especially important for A9 DA neurons that have an elevated metabolism with a high requirement for energy production". It has been noted further that [...] "A9 dopaminergic neurons may be at particular risk since in addition to their high mitochondrial activity they are under intense oxidative stress caused by the production of hydrogen peroxide via <b>autoxidation</b> and/or monoamine oxidase (MAO)-mediated deamination of dopamine and the subsequent reaction of accessible ferrous iron to generate highly toxic hydroxyl radicals". This may explain the risk of these cells for degeneration in Parkinson's disease. The hemoglobin-derived iron in these cells is not the cause of the post-mortem darkness of these cells (origin of the Latin name, substantia nigra), but rather is due to neuromelanin.|$|E

50|$|<b>Autoxidation</b> is a {{free radical}} chain process. Such {{reactions}} {{can be divided into}} three stages: chain initiation, propagation, and termination. In the initiation process, some event causes free radicals to be formed. For example, free radicals can be produced purposefully by the decomposition of a radical initiator, such as benzoyl peroxide. In some cases, initiation occurs by a process that is not well understood but is thought to be the spontaneous reaction of oxygen with a material with a readily abstractable hydrogen. Destructive <b>autoxidation</b> processes also are initiated by pollutants such as those in smog.|$|E
