50|$|The {{solution}} to this problem can <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> a form most suitable for hand calculations. It can <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>in</b> graphical form.

5|$|While bubbles {{can form}} {{anywhere}} in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles. Joint pain ("the bends") accounts for about 60% to 70% of all altitude DCS cases, with the shoulder being the most common site. Neurological symptoms <b>are</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> 10% to 15% of DCS cases with headache and visual disturbances being the most common symptom. Skin manifestations <b>are</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> about 10% to 15% of cases. Pulmonary DCS ("the chokes") is very rare in divers and has been observed much less frequently in aviators since the introduction of oxygen pre-breathing protocols. The table below shows symptoms for different DCS types.|$|E

5|$|A {{striking}} {{feature of}} metabolism is {{the similarity of}} the basic metabolic pathways and components between even vastly different species. For example, the set of carboxylic acids that are {{best known as the}} intermediates in the citric acid cycle <b>are</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> all known organisms, being found in species as diverse as the unicellular bacterium Escherichia coli and huge multicellular organisms like elephants. These striking similarities in metabolic pathways are likely due to their early appearance in evolutionary history, and their retention because of their efficacy.|$|E

5|$|Accompanying {{injuries}} often play a {{key role}} in the outcome. Injuries that may accompany TBI include pulmonary contusion and laceration; and fractures of the sternum, ribs and clavicles. Spinal cord injury, facial trauma, traumatic aortic rupture, injuries to the abdomen, lung, and head <b>are</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> 40–100%. The most common accompanying injury is esophageal perforation or rupture (known as Boerhaave syndrome), which occurs in as many as 43% of the penetrating injuries to the neck that cause tracheal injury.|$|E
5|$|Agaricus hondensis {{mushrooms}} are toxic, and consuming the fruit bodies causes gastroenteritis. Some fruit bodies smell of creosote, an odor that {{becomes even more}} prevalent if the {{mushrooms are}} cooked. Cooking also introduces an unpleasant soapy-metallic flavor. The fruit bodies are used as food by the vagrant shrew (Sorex vagrans) and the American shrew mole (Neurotrichus gibbsii). Relatively high levels of the chemical hydroquinone <b>are</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} stable isotopes, {{which make up}} almost all lead that exists naturally, there are trace {{quantities}} of a few radioactive isotopes. One of them is lead-210; although it has a half-life of only 22.3 years, small quantities occur in nature because lead-210 is produced by a long decay series that starts with uranium-238 (which has been present for billions of years on Earth). Lead-211, -212, and -214 <b>are</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> the decay chains of uranium-235, thorium-232, and uranium-238, respectively, so traces of {{all three of these}} lead isotopes are found naturally. Minute traces of lead-209 arise from the very rare cluster decay of radium-223, one of the daughter products of natural uranium-235. Lead-210 is particularly useful for helping to identify the ages of samples by measuring its ratio to lead-206 (both isotopes <b>are</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> a single decay chain).|$|E

5|$|CSS parsing: A {{number of}} illegal CSS {{statements}} <b>are</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> Acid2 to test error handling. Standards-compliant browsers {{are expected to}} handle these errors as the CSS specification directs.

5|$|Dendritic {{cells are}} {{specialized}} antigen-presenting cells {{that have long}} outgrowths called dendrites, that help to engulf microbes and other invaders. Dendritic cells <b>are</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> the tissues that are {{in contact with the}} external environment, mainly the skin, the inner lining of the nose, the lungs, the stomach, and the intestines. Once activated, they mature and migrate to the lymphoid tissues where they interact with T cells and B cells to initiate and orchestrate the adaptive immune response.|$|E
50|$|T-PLL has the immunophenotype of {{a mature}} (post-thymic) T-lymphocyte, and the {{neoplastic}} cells are typically positive for pan-T antigens CD2, CD3, and CD7 and negative for TdT and CD1a. The immunophenotype CD4+/CD8- <b>is</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> 60% of cases, the CD4+/CD8+ immunophenotype <b>is</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> 25%, and the CD4-/CD8+ immunophenotype <b>is</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> 15% of cases.|$|R

5|$|Heavy metals <b>are</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> {{nearly all}} aspects of modern life. Iron {{may be the most}} common as it {{accounts}} for 90% of all refined metals. Platinum may be the most ubiquitous given it is said to be found in, or used to produce, 20% of all consumer goods.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals are {{relatively}} scarce in the Earth's crust but <b>are</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> {{many aspects of}} modern life. They are used in, for example, golf clubs, cars, antiseptics, self-cleaning ovens, plastics, solar panels, mobile phones, and particle accelerators.|$|E
5|$|Hemorrhagic cystitis, {{characterized}} by {{blood in the}} urine, can occur secondary {{to a number of}} causes including: infections, radiation therapy, underlying cancer, medications and toxins. Medications that commonly cause this problem include the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide with rates of 2 to 40%. Eosinophilic cystitis is a rare condition where eosinophiles <b>are</b> <b>present</b> <b>in</b> the bladder wall. Signs and symptoms are similar to a bladder infection. Its cause is not entirely clear; however, it may be linked to food allergies, infections, and medications among others.|$|E
