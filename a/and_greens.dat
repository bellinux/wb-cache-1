40|$|This study {{proposes a}} new concept, green {{organisational}} ambidexterity, that integrates <b>green</b> exploration learning <b>and</b> <b>green</b> exploitation learning simultaneously. Besides, this study {{argues that the}} antecedents of green organisational ambidexterity are <b>green</b> shared vision <b>and</b> <b>green</b> absorptive capacity <b>and</b> its consequents are green radical innovation performance <b>and</b> <b>green</b> incremental innovation performance. The results demonstrate that green exploration learning partially mediates the positive relationships between green radical innovation performance and its two antecedents—green shared vision <b>and</b> <b>green</b> absorptive capacity. In addition, this study indicates that green exploitation learning partially mediates the positive relationships between green incremental innovation performance and its two antecedents—green shared vision <b>and</b> <b>green</b> absorptive capacity. Hence, firms have to increase their green shared vision, <b>green</b> absorptive capacity, <b>and</b> <b>green</b> organisational ambidexterity to raise their green radical innovation performance <b>and</b> <b>green</b> incremental innovation performance...|$|R

5|$|In 610, Shahrbaraz was {{approaching}} Antioch. But the Persian front {{was not the}} immediate threat: the rebels of Africa were. Having secured control of Egypt, they proceeded to invade Syria and Cyprus while a large fleet under Heraclius the Younger, a son of the exarch, set sail for Constantinople. Supporters from Sicily, Crete and Thessalonica were joining his campaign. The rebels reached Constantinople in October 610. The only forces available to Phocas to defend the city were the Excubitors of his bodyguard and the irregular forces of the Blues <b>and</b> <b>Greens,</b> the city's racing factions. Priscus, {{the commander of the}} Excubitors, chose the moment to reveal his allegiance to Heraclius, having apparently secretly conspired for some time. The Greens also changed sides. Constantinople fell with relative ease.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, another front had opened. The Exarchate of Africa under Heraclius the Elder had revolted against Phocas. The {{situation}} in 609–610 was quickly becoming dire for Domentziolus and all Phocas loyalists. Their {{defense against the}} Sassanids had failed. There were Persian forces in Mesopotamia, Armenia, Syria and the Anatolian provinces. Rebel Byzantine forces held Africa and Egypt. Slavs were occupying northern Illyricum. In Thessalonica and various towns of Anatolia and Syria, the Blues <b>and</b> <b>Greens</b> were settling their differences with open conflict. In areas of Syria, the Jews were revolting and lynching Christians. Even in Constantinople, the crowds taunted Phocas for his love of liquor, implying alcoholism.|$|E

This research employed an empirical study {{by use of}} the questionnaire survey method. The questionnaires were randomly mailed to consumers who {{had the experience of}} purchasing information and Toyotavvti products. The results showed that green brand image, <b>green</b> satisfaction, <b>and</b> <b>green</b> trust are positively related to green brand equity. Furthermore, the positive relationship between <b>green</b> brand image <b>and</b> <b>green</b> brand equity is partially mediated by <b>green</b> satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>green</b> trust.

This measure {{was based on}} the World War I dazzle system modified by observations in the western Pacific; and was applied to most surface ships in the Pacific during 1944 and 1945. Different patterns were devised for classes with large numbers of ships so the pattern would not identify the class of ship.|$|E

5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{is responsible}} for the blues <b>and</b> <b>greens</b> of the feathers of many birds (the bee-eater, kingfisher and roller, for example), as well as many butterfly wings, beetle wing-cases (elytra) and (while rare among flowers) the gloss of buttercup petals. These are often iridescent, as in peacock feathers and nacreous shells such as of pearl oysters (Pteriidae) and Nautilus. This is because the reflected colour depends on the viewing angle, which in turn governs the apparent spacing of the structures responsible. Structural colours can be combined with pigment colours: peacock feathers are pigmented brown with melanin, while buttercup petals have both carotenoid pigments for yellowness and thin films for reflectiveness.|$|E

5|$|Chariot racing {{seems to}} have {{declined}} {{in the course of}} the seventh century, with the losses the Empire suffered at the hands of the Arabs and the decline of the population and economy. The Blues <b>and</b> <b>Greens,</b> deprived of any political power, were relegated to a purely ceremonial role. After the Nika riots, the factions grew less violent as their importance in imperial ceremony increased. In particular, the iconoclast emperor Constantine V (r. 741–775) courted the factions for their support in his campaigns against the monks. They aided the emperor in executing his prisoners and by putting on shows in which monks and nuns held hands while the crowd hissed at them. Constantine V {{seems to have}} given the factions a political role in addition to their traditionally ceremonial role. The two factions continued their activity until the imperial court was moved to Blachernae during the 12th century.|$|E

5|$|The {{different}} styles of Cabernet Sauvignon from different regions can also influence how well the wine matches up with certain foods. Old World wines, such as Bordeaux, have earthier influences and will pair better with mushrooms. Wines from cooler climates that have noticeable vegetal notes can be balanced with vegetables <b>and</b> <b>greens.</b> New World wines, with bolder fruit flavors that may even be perceived as sweet, will pair well with bolder dishes that have lots of different flavor influences. While Cabernet Sauvignon {{has the potential to}} pair well with bitter dark chocolate, it will not pair well with sweeter styles such as milk chocolate. The wine can typically pair well with a variety of cheeses, such as Cheddar, mozzarella and Brie, but full flavored or blue cheeses will typically compete too much with the flavors of Cabernet Sauvignon to be a complementary pairing.|$|E
