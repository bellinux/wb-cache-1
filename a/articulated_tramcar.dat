50|$|The GT4 (from German: Gelenktriebwagen 4-achsig, which {{translates}} as 4-axle <b>articulated</b> <b>tramcar)</b> is a GT4 type tramway vehicle built by Maschinenfabrik Esslingen.|$|E
50|$|LVS-97 (71-147) is a Russian-made six axle tram. LVS denotes «Ленинградский Вагон Сочленёный» (Leningradski Vagon Sochlenyeni) {{which is}} an <b>articulated</b> <b>tramcar,</b> made in St. Petersburg. It was {{produced}} at the Petersburg Tram Mechanical Factory from 1997 (as its name implies by the 97 suffix) through to 2004.|$|E
50|$|In 1943 a large project, never realised, was designed. This project {{planned to}} build large tunnels in {{the centre of}} Marseille. The busiest lines would join into two tunnels.In 1949 a further {{modernisation}} occurred. The first <b>articulated</b> <b>tramcars</b> was designed and built (Algiers tramway possessed <b>articulated</b> SATRAMO <b>tramcars).</b> These were created by joining two older tramcars. These tramcars remained unique until 1985 when Nantes tramway opened.|$|R
2500|$|Tramlink {{operates}} {{with modern}} <b>articulated</b> <b>tramcars</b> of Bombardier low-floor design called CR4000, {{based upon the}} K4000 type of the Cologne Stadtbahn, with the tram units numbered from 2530. [...] This number was the next in sequence from the last London tram, number 2529, withdrawn in 1952.|$|R
50|$|From 1959, <b>articulated</b> <b>tramcars</b> of Type E were {{introduced}} to the Vienna tram network. However, these trams could be operated with trailer cars only with great difficulty, due to their underpowered motors. In view of this problem, it became necessary to order a successor type soon afterwards.|$|R
50|$|In the eighties, it {{was decided}} to produce a higher-capacity tram vehicle. The result was the Tatra KT8D5 <b>articulated</b> <b>tramcar,</b> of which 49 were delivered. All of these were modernized and {{equipped}} with a low-floor section. After the Velvet revolution, the company decided not to continue with the deliveries and instead ordered delivery of 150 standard-length Tatra T6A5 cars. Shortly after these deliveries ended, the traditional producer of trams for Prague, ČKD Tatra, went bankrupt, stopping new tram deliveries for several years.|$|E
50|$|The Tatra K5AR was an <b>articulated</b> <b>tramcar</b> {{built by}} ČKD Tatra. It was unusual {{in that it}} was one of the few tramcars built by ČKD Tatra to be {{exported}} outside of Eastern Europe, and was designed specifically for the city of Cairo, Egypt, which took 200 examples. The K5AR was bi-directional and was fitted with 3 doors in each car, and its electrical equipment was designed to withstand the sub-tropical climate of Egypt. After less than a decade in service, the vast majority of these tramcars were in very poor condition owing to over-loading and poor maintenance, and only a small handful remained in service until the mid-1980s.|$|E
50|$|The Tatra K1 was an {{experimental}} tramcar developed by ČKD Tatra between 1964 and 1965. Previous Tatra units had been concerned primarily with gaining maximum capacity {{in a single}} tramcar, and Tatra sought to correct this {{through the development of}} its first <b>articulated</b> <b>tramcar,</b> the result being the K1. The K1 was based largely on the already established T3, although certain aspects of the electrical equipment were adjusted in the K1. After a short spell on trial in Prague, the two prototype vehicles entered service in Ostrava, where they remained for 3 years until 1968 before being returned to the manufacturer. The test runs had exposed problems with the electronic equipment of the K1, and thus the two prototypes remained the only ones ever produced.|$|E

40|$|Urban rail {{vehicles}} {{can present}} {{many types of}} architecture, definitely {{different from those of}} traditional rail vehicles. When dealing with long <b>articulated</b> <b>tramcars,</b> complex coupling effects between the vertical and lateral dynamics may arise. Making reference to a modern tramcar, the coupling phenomena are investigated in detail by means of numerical simulation, considering the dynamic behaviour during the negotiation of curves with or without superelevation...|$|R
50|$|The oldest {{vehicles}} in active service until 2013 were the <b>articulated</b> <b>tramcars</b> of types GT4d, GT4e and GT4f and the matching trailers of types GB4d, GB4e and GB4f. The vehicles were built between 1973 and 1977 by Wegmann & Co. in Kassel. Of the 61 trams and 57 trailers originally delivered, four GT4f vehicles {{are still in}} service, though limited to driver training purposes and other special occasions. The rest have been scrapped or delivered to Timișoara in Romania.|$|R
50|$|Tatra KT4 is {{the name}} of a four-axle type <b>articulated</b> <b>tramcar</b> {{developed}} by the Czech firm ČKD Tatra. The first pre-production vehicles entered service in Potsdam in 1975, with the first production vehicles in 1977. A total of 1,747 units were built, with initial deliveries to East Germany (DDR) and later to the USSR and SFR Yugoslavia. KT4 variants were built for both standard gauge and metre gauge tramways. Production of the KT4 tramcar was halted in 1991 due to worldwide economic and political changes at the time. Production was briefly resumed in 1997 to construct the last 20 units for Belgrade, Serbia.Since the start of the 1990s, many of the earliest production tramcars have gone through extensive refurbishment and rebuilding, including the replacement of folding doors and the installation of low-floor center sections.|$|E
50|$|The Tatra K2 was {{the first}} {{production}} <b>articulated</b> <b>tramcar</b> built by ČKD Tatra between 1966 and 1983, following {{the failure of the}} experimental K1 which never entered production. It was noted that the main problem with the K1 was with the new electrical equipment, and therefore the same electrical equipment of the T3 was incorporated into the new K2. The prototype entered service in 1966 as Prague tramcar number 7000, where it spent only a short spell before being transferred to Most, and then again moved to Brno. Production of the K2 on a mass scale started the same year, and many examples remain in service to this day, albeit most having been extensively modernised. The modernisation of the K2 fleet in Brno, the biggest customer of the type, included the complete re-modelling of the front end, and the upgrading of their electronic equipment. These modernised examples were labeled K2R, whereby the 'R' stands for 'reconstructed'.|$|E

5000|$|By 1980, {{the launch}} of the city's [...] "Transport concept" [...] ("Verkehrskonzept") {{signaled}} a realisation that oil prices could not be expected to return to 1960s levels: trams were no longer so readily to be written off as yesterday's solutions. There was talk of a new line for the Olympic Village and another for the Reichenau quarter. There was also a plan for reinstating Line 4 which had been replaced by a bus service in 1976 in response to the widening of the Haller Street. To service this expansion new six- and eight-axle <b>articulated</b> <b>tramcars</b> were purchased from Bielefeld, and a large new tram depot would be built.|$|R
50|$|Tramlink {{operates}} {{with modern}} <b>articulated</b> <b>tramcars</b> of Bombardier low-floor design called CR4000, {{based upon the}} K4000 type of the Cologne Stadtbahn, with the tram units numbered from 2530. This number was the next in sequence from the last London tram, number 2529, withdrawn in 1952.Since it opened on 11 May 2000, the 38 km of track have been operated by FirstGroup on behalf of Transport for London on three routes across South London. It features accessible low platforms that match the 350 mm high car floor or tram stops {{at the same height}} as the pavement. Much of the track is dedicated tramway, with some sections shared with other road vehicles, including some of the same roads served by the previous generation of tram. The off-street track includes new rights-of-way, adapted former railway lines and one section running alongside a Network Rail line. Part of the formation between Mitcham and Hackbridge was originally used by the Surrey Iron Railway, the world's first public railway, authorised by Act of Parliament in 1803.|$|R
5000|$|... 33 <b>articulated</b> {{double-ended}} low-floor <b>tramcars</b> (9001-9033) {{were delivered}} in 1990 and 1991 by SOCIMI in Milan. These trams are {{fitted with a}} 2-axle bogie at both front ends, and small wheels in {{the centre of the}} car (wheel arrangement Bo'2'Bo'), thus allowing a 70% low floor. Since SOCIMI went broke 27 of the 60 cars on order were not built at the time, but in 2003 and 2004 eight additional cars (9034-9041) entered service, assembled from spare parts salvaged from the dissolved SOCIMI works.|$|R
