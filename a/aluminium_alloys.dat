5|$|Metallic {{scandium}} {{was produced}} {{for the first}} time in 1937 by electrolysis of a eutectic mixture of potassium, lithium, and scandium chlorides, at 700–800°C. The first pound of 99% pure scandium metal was produced in 1960. Production of <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> began in 1971, following a US patent. Aluminium-scandium alloys were also developed in the USSR.|$|E
5|$|The <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> {{used for}} diving {{cylinders}} are 6061 and 6351. 6351 alloy {{is subject to}} sustained load cracking and cylinders manufactured of this alloy should be periodically eddy current tested according to national legislation and manufacturer's recommendations. 6351 alloy has been superseded for new manufacture, but many old cylinders are still in service.|$|E

5|$|The {{second largest}} {{application}} for manganese is in aluminum alloys. Aluminium with roughly 1.5% manganese has increased {{resistance to corrosion}} through grains that absorb impurities which would lead to galvanic corrosion. The corrosion-resistant <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> 3004 and 3104 (0.8 to 1.5% manganese) are used for most beverage cans. Before year 2000, more than 1.6 million tonnes of those alloys were used; at 1% manganese, this consumed 16,000 tonnes of manganese.|$|E
5|$|While Klein's use of {{aluminium}} for a bicycle frames {{was not entirely}} novel, his use of large diameter tubes was. <b>Aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> have a Young's modulus around a third that of steel, but with thicker tubes {{he was able to}} make a bicycle that weighed around 15% less than a conventional model.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{is used to}} make {{free-machining}} steels and free-machining <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> for {{precision machining}} properties. It has similar effect to lead and improves the chip breaking during machining. The shrinking on solidification in lead {{and the expansion of}} bismuth compensate each other and therefore lead and bismuth are often used in similar quantities. Similarly, alloys containing comparable parts of bismuth and lead exhibit a very small change (on the order 0.01%) upon melting, solidification or aging. Such alloys are used in high-precision casting, e.g. in dentistry, to create models and molds. Bismuth is also used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons and as a thermocouple material.|$|E

40|$|Ni-P-fly ash {{coatings}} {{were produced}} on zincate coated 5083 wrought <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> substrates {{with the aid}} of an electroless deposition technique. Structural and chemical characterization of the produced coatings was performed {{with the aid of}} X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS) techniques. The Ni-P-fly ash coating was found to consist of an amorphous Ni-P matrix with dispersed fly ash particles. The wear resistance of the Ni-P-fly ash coating on zincate treated <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> was observed to be higher than that of the bare <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy,</b> when sliding against a stainless steel counterface. In addition, the adhesion between the Ni-P-fly ash/zincate coating and the <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> substrate was also studied with a scratch testing apparatus. The adhesion strength of Ni-P-fly ash/zincate coating on the <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> substrate was observed to be higher in comparison to the Ni-P/zincate coating on the same <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy.</b> (C) 2009 Elsevier B.

5|$|Scandium {{is present}} {{in most of the}} {{deposits}} of rare-earth and uranium compounds, but it is extracted from these ores in only a few mines worldwide. Because of the low availability and the difficulties in the preparation of metallic scandium, which was first done in 1937, applications for scandium were not developed until the 1970s. The positive effects of scandium on <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> were discovered in the 1970s, and its use in such alloys remains its only major application. The global trade of scandium oxide is about 10 tonnes per year.|$|E
5|$|The {{airframe}} is of semi-monocoque structure constructed {{primarily of}} <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys.</b> High strength steel and titanium alloys are partially adopted in some critical areas. The airframe {{is designed for}} a service life of 4,000 flight hours or 25 years, the first overhaul being due at 1,200 flight hours. Block 2 JF-17s incorporate greater use of composite materials in the airframe to reduce weight. The retractable undercarriage has a tricycle arrangement with a single steerable nose-wheel and two main undercarriages. The hydraulic brakes have an automatic anti-skid system. The position {{and shape of the}} inlets is designed to give the required airflow to the jet engine during manoeuvres involving high angles of attack.|$|E
5|$|The largest use {{of calcium}} is in steelmaking, {{due to its}} strong {{chemical}} affinity for oxygen and sulfur. Its oxides and sulfides, once formed, give liquid lime aluminate and sulfide inclusions in steel which float out; on treatment, these inclusions disperse throughout the steel and became small and spherical, improving castability, cleanliness and general mechanical properties. Calcium is also used in maintenance-free automotive batteries, in which the use of 0.1% calcium–lead alloys {{instead of the usual}} antimony–lead alloys leads to lower water loss and lower self-discharging. Due to the risk of expansion and cracking, aluminium is sometimes also incorporated into these alloys. These lead–calcium alloys are also used in casting, replacing lead–antimony alloys. Calcium is also used to strengthen <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> used for bearings, for the control of graphitic carbon in cast iron, and to remove bismuth impurities from lead. Calcium metal is found in some drain cleaners, where it functions to generate heat and calcium hydroxide that saponifies the fats and liquefies the proteins (for example, those in hair) that block drains. Besides metallurgy, the reactivity of calcium is exploited to remove nitrogen from high-purity argon gas and as a getter for oxygen and nitrogen. It is also used as a reducing agent in the production of chromium, zirconium, thorium, and uranium. It {{can also be used to}} store hydrogen gas, as it reacts with hydrogen to form solid calcium hydride, from which the hydrogen can easily be re-extracted.|$|E
40|$|The {{quasi-static}} flexural {{and impact}} performance, up to projectile impact velocities of about 270 m s− 1, of fibre metal laminates (FMLs), which consist of relatively thin, alternately stacked, layers of an <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> and a thermoset glass fibre epoxy composite, have been investigated. The effects of varying (a) the yield strength, tensile {{strength and ductility}} of the <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> layer, (b) the surface treatment used for the <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> layers and (c) the number of layers present in the FML have been studied. It was found that increasing {{the strength of the}} <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> increases the quasi-static flexural strength of the FML, providing that good adhesion is achieved between the metal and the composite layers. Further, increasing the number of alternating layers of the <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> and fibre composite also somewhat increases the quasi-static flexural properties of the FML. In contrast, increasing the strength of the <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> had relatively little effect on the impact perforation resistance of the FML, but increasing the number of alternating layers of <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloy</b> and fibre composite did significantly increase the impact perforation resistance of the FML. The degree of adhesion achieved between the layers had only a negligible influence on the impact perforation resistance...|$|R

A deliberate heat treatment process of multiple steps was used to control their physical properties.|$|E
25|$|The {{heat-affected zone}} (HAZ) {{is common to}} all welding processes. As {{indicated}} by the name, this region is subjected to a thermal cycle but is not deformed during welding.

In fact, in age-hardened <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> this region commonly exhibits the poorest mechanical properties.|$|E
25|$|Creep {{resistance}} {{is a key}} property of the refractory metals. In metals, the starting of creep correlates with the melting point of the material; the creep in <b>aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> starts at 200°C, while for refractory metals temperatures above 1500°C are necessary. This resistance against deformation at high temperatures makes the refractory metals suitable against strong forces at high temperature, for example in jet engines, or tools used during forging.|$|E

25|$|The {{surface finish}} is {{sometimes}} {{used to measure}} the machinability of a material. Soft, ductile materials tend to form a built up edge. Stainless steel and other materials with a high strain hardening ability also want to form a built up edge. <b>Aluminium</b> <b>alloys,</b> cold worked steels, and free machining steels, as well as materials with a high shear zone don't tend to form built up edges, so these materials would rank as more machinable.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aluminium</b> <b>alloys</b> often {{undergo a}} surface treatment. Electrochemical {{conditions}} in the bath are carefully adjusted so that uniform pores, several nanometers wide, appear in the metal's oxide film. These pores allow the oxide to grow much thicker than passivating conditions would allow. At {{the end of the}} treatment, the pores are allowed to seal, forming a harder-than-usual surface layer. If this coating is scratched, normal passivation processes take over to protect the damaged area.|$|E
