5|$|Securely {{attached}} {{children are}} {{best able to}} explore when they have the knowledge of a secure base (their caregiver) to return to in times of need. When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also, assuming the parent's assistance is helpful, educates the child in {{how to cope with}} the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment {{can be seen as the}} most adaptive attachment style. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the parent is available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring <b>and</b> <b>attentive</b> towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.|$|E

25|$|The {{gap between}} rich and poor is {{enormous}} in a country that was once the most egalitarian nation in the world. In the youth movements, Zionism was seen as the Jewish way of achieving social justice that would encompass the whole world. That ideal has been shattered. Now we have the pretension of being an open <b>and</b> <b>attentive</b> socialist welfare state, but in fact, that message only comes from a single direction. The system only responds to those who shout. Those who are silent remain on the outside. The basic human element has disappeared from the system.|$|E

25|$|By the way, {{would you}} convey my {{compliments}} to the purist who reads your proofs {{and tell him}} or her that I write {{in a sort of}} broken-down patois which is something like the way a Swiss-waiter talks, and that when I split an infinitive, God damn it, I split it so it will remain split, and when I interrupt the velvety smoothness of my more or less literate syntax with a few sudden words of barroom vernacular, this is done with the eyes wide open and the mind relaxed <b>and</b> <b>attentive.</b> The method may not be perfect, but it is all I have.|$|E

As both of his parents were musical, he received singing lesson and learned to play the piano and the violin. Dmitry was a diligent and good student, polite <b>and</b> <b>attentive,</b> capable and kind. He was also very shy and introverted, preferring quiet times reading to more usual pursuits of childhood.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the judges}} commands, {{the dog and}} handler team walks a {{predetermined}} pattern with the dog remaining on the handler's left side and reasonably close <b>and</b> <b>attentive</b> to the handler. The dog also must automatically sit when the judge instructs the team to halt. Each sponsoring organization has different requirements for what must be included in this exercise but generally a heeling pattern must include: a left turn, a right turn, an about turn, a fast and slow section, and a halt. Heeling {{is one of the}} most basic obedience exercises and as such it is often incorporated into other exercises such as the moving stand and the figure 8. It is also how most teams will enter and move about the ring between exercises.|$|E

25|$|Michael Parkinson always sought guests who, {{besides being}} well known, {{had some sort}} of story to relate. He then saw his job as {{allowing}} them to tell it and did so by being open, relaxed <b>and</b> <b>attentive.</b> (He learnt very early on that in order to be an adept interviewer, he had to be a good listener.) He researched his subjects thoroughly, and, in the early shows, always had his list of questions to hand. Having guided them to an area of discussion, he rarely interrupted his guests — except to provide the occasional prompt — instead letting them expand on a particular topic. Sometimes, a person would warm to this style with unpredictable results. For example, he regards his chats with Shirley MacLaine as bordering on flirtatious. In his final programme, broadcast 22 December 2007, Parkinson stated that one of his most memorable interviews was with Jacob Bronowski in 1973.|$|E

500|$|According to the {{economist}} and biographer Robert Skidelsky, Keynes's parents were loving <b>and</b> <b>attentive.</b> They {{remained in the}} same house throughout their lives, where the children were always welcome to return. Keynes would receive considerable support from his father, including expert coaching to help him pass his scholarship exams and financial help both as a young man and when his assets were nearly wiped out at the onset of Great Depression in 1929. Keynes's mother made her children's interests her own, and according to Skidelsky, [...] "because she could grow up with her children, they never outgrew home".|$|E
500|$|An {{audiobook}} {{version of}} The Hunger Games {{was released in}} December 2008. Read by the actress Carolyn McCormick, it has a total running time of eleven hours and fourteen minutes. The magazine AudioFile said: [...] "Carolyn McCormick gives a detailed <b>and</b> <b>attentive</b> narration. However, she may rely {{too much on the}} strength of the prose without providing the drama young adult listeners often enjoy." [...] School Library Journal also praised the audiobook, stating that [...] "McCormick ably voices the action-packed sequences and Katniss's every fear and strength shines through, along with her doomed growing attraction to one of her fellow Tributes." ...|$|E
500|$|The two {{travellers}} {{then turned}} south-east, re-entered Sweden and travelled through Uppsala to Stockholm. Towards {{the end of}} September they crossed the Gulf of Bothnia to Åbo (Turku), the site of Europe's most northerly university, {{in the part of}} Finland then under Swedish sovereignty. They proceeded eastwards to the Russian border, and reached St Petersburg at the end of October. They spent two months in the city; through influential contacts at the British Embassy they visited places generally inaccessible to the public, including Tsar Alexander's private quarters in the Winter Palace. They experienced Muslim worship at first hand, as the city's large Muslim population observed Ramadan; Heber described the crowds gathered for prayer in an improvised mosque as [...] "the most decent <b>and</b> <b>attentive</b> congregation [...] had seen since leaving England".|$|E

500|$|Ginia Bellafante, {{a critic}} for The New York Times, proclaimed the drama gave the {{audience}} [...] "innocent faces and heaving breasts, hyperbolizing the sex that always lurks {{beneath the surface}} of Austen's astringent presence." [...] She went on to say Northanger Abbey was made to be a television movie and commented that it was more fun than the book. The San Francisco Chronicle's David Wiegand wrote [...] "Persuasion is a bigger challenge to try to squeeze into 90 minutes, the real difference between that film and Northanger is the latter's consistency of high-quality performances, a careful <b>and</b> <b>attentive</b> adaptation by Andrew Davies and solid direction by Jon Jones." [...] Writing for The Daily Telegraph, James Walton observed [...] "Northanger Abbey was a perfectly acceptable costume drama – but not one that ever really caught fire." [...] Simon Hoggart, writing for The Spectator, commented that Davies's adaptation of Northanger Abbey [...] "was much bolder and more confident than Mansfield Park the week before." ...|$|E
500|$|Warbrick said of {{his time}} in the British Isles: [...] "My {{impression}} of England and its people during the tour was a very favourable one, more especially does this apply to private individuals. I found them everywhere very kind <b>and</b> <b>attentive</b> and apparently anxious to make one's visit as pleasant as possible". The term [...] "private individuals" [...] may have been used to exclude from praise both the RFU and London press. Following the tour he also criticised the partiality of the English referees, and believed that the English administrators displayed a double standard in their treatment of the Natives; the RFU treated the Native team's motives for touring with suspicion, believing the enterprise to be speculative and criticising them for not upholding the amateur principles the RFU liked to espouse. Yet the RFU continued to select Andrew Stoddart for England, despite him touring with the speculative and unsanctioned 1888 British team that travelled to New Zealand and Australia.|$|E

While the President was recuperating in the hospital after the 1981 assassination attempt, Nancy wrote in her diary, [...] "Nothing can happen to my Ronnie. My life would be over." [...] In a letter to Nancy, Ronald wrote, [...] "whatever I treasure and enjoy... all would be without meaning if I didn't have you." [...] When her husband was afflicted with Alzheimer's disease In 1998, Nancy told Vanity Fair, [...] "Our relationship is very special. We were {{very much in love}} and still are. When I say my life began with Ronnie, well, it's true. It did. I can't imagine life without him." [...] Nancy was known for the focused <b>and</b> <b>attentive</b> look, termed [...] "the Gaze", that she fastened upon her husband during his speeches and appearances.|$|E
