5|$|Edmontosaurus {{has had a}} long <b>and</b> <b>complicated</b> {{history in}} paleontology, having spent decades with various species {{classified}} in other genera. Its taxonomic history intertwines at various points with the genera Agathaumas, Anatosaurus, Anatotitan, Claosaurus, Hadrosaurus, Thespesius, and Trachodon, and references predating the 1980s typically use Anatosaurus, Claosaurus, Thespesius, or Trachodon for edmontosaur fossils (excluding those assigned to E. regalis), depending on author and date. Although Edmontosaurus was only named in 1917, its oldest well-supported species (E. annectens) was named in 1892 as a species of Claosaurus.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAbnormal {{dispersion}} of repolarization {{may contribute to the}} arrhythmogenic physiologic substrate of ventricular arrhythmia. Geographic {{dispersion of}} monophasic action potential duration was determined in steady state (drive cycle lengths 600 and 430 ms) between widely spaced right ventricular endocardial sites (geographic dispersion) in 10 control patients with right ventricular disease <b>and</b> <b>complicating</b> ventricular tachycardia (n = 9), 6 patients with right and left ventricular disease <b>and</b> <b>complicating</b> ventricular tachycardia <b>and</b> 7 patients with ischemic heart disease <b>and</b> <b>complicating</b> ventricular tachycardia. No significant difference in geographic dispersion could be demonstrated among the groups. Difference of monophasic action potential duration at adjacent right ventricular endocardial sites (adjacent dispersion) was determined after ventricular extrastimulation during construction of simultaneous electrical restitution curves in the same patient groups. Maximal adjacent dispersion over the electrical restitution curve was compared between disease and control groups. There was a significant difference in observations of maximal adjacent dispersion in patients with right ventricular disease <b>and</b> <b>complicating</b> ventricular tachycardia (range 5 to 85 ms, median 22. 5; 14 pairs of sites; p < 0. 05) and patients with right and left ventricular disease <b>and</b> <b>complicating</b> ventricular tachycardia (range 5 to 50 ms, median 17. 5; 14 pairs of sites; p < 0. 05) compared with control patients (range 5 to 20 ms, median 10; 15 pairs of sites). This difference was not evident when patients with ischemic heart disease <b>and</b> <b>complicating</b> ventricular tachycardia (range 5 to 25 ms, median 12. 5; 12 pairs of sites) were compared with control patients. Maximal percent monophasic action potential shortening from steady state was significantly greater (p < 0. 001) in both groups with greater adjacent dispersions, and prolongation of activation time at monophasic action potential recording sites after premature extrastimulation tended to be greater in patients with right or right and left ventricular disease <b>and</b> <b>complicating</b> ventricular tachycardia. It is concluded that in disease, exaggeration of monophasic action potential shortening after premature ventricular extrastimulation may contribute to the electrophysiologic arrhythmogenic substrate...|$|R

5|$|According to Ubisoft Toronto founder Jade Raymond, {{the series}} {{had become too}} grueling <b>and</b> <b>complicated</b> for modern gamers, and its {{popularity}} had suffered relative to Ubisoft flagship franchises such as Assassin's Creed and Far Cry. The Toronto studio hoped to introduce the franchise to a broader audience, while remaining tactical and hardcore for long-term series fans. It introduced a perfectionist mode, significantly increasing the game's difficulty by removing some of Fisher's abilities. The team also introduced accessible, action-oriented gameplay segments which would suit new players, crafting open-ended levels which could be reached with different approaches to broaden the variety of play. The developers re-worked the controls to increase gameplay fluidity, allowing players to automatically leap over objects and traverse a simplified environment.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} British law {{relating}} to marriage {{was based on}} the legal doctrine of coverture, in which a woman's legal rights and obligations were subsumed by those of her husband upon their matrimony. By law a woman had no separate legal existence, and all her property became her husband's; divorce initiated by a woman was difficult <b>and</b> <b>complicated.</b> In April 1868 Josephine and fellow suffragist Elizabeth Wolstenholme set up and became joint secretaries of the Married Women's Property Committee to pressure parliament into changing the law. Josephine remained on the committee until the campaign was successful, with the passing into law of the Married Women's Property Act 1882.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{diversity}} of the originally broadly defined Liliaceae (s.l.), many {{attempts have been made to}} form supageneric classification systems, organizing the genera into subfamilies, tribes, or other suprageneric taxa (taxonomic groupings between genus and family). By 1813, Candolle recognised five subdivisions which he called tribes (Asparagées, Trilliacées, Asphodelées, Bromeliées, Tulipacées), all of which Jussieu had made separate families, with the exception of Tulipa, which was a genus within the Liliaceae. By 1845, John Lindley observed that the family had become extremely diverse, ill-defined and unstable, not only by its overall circumscription, but also by its subdivisions. For the 133 genera he included, he described eleven suborders. By the 1870s, as Baker describes in his revision of the family, the taxonomy of Liliaceae had become vast <b>and</b> <b>complicated.</b> His approach was to divide the family into eight tribes.|$|E

5|$|During Godwin's exile, Robert {{is said to}} {{have been}} sent by the king on an errand to William, Duke of Normandy. The reason for the embassy is uncertain. William of Jumièges says that Robert went to tell Duke William that Edward wished William to be his heir. The medieval writer William of Poitiers gives the same reason, but also adds that Robert took with him as hostages Godwin's son Wulfnoth and {{grandson}} Hakon (son of Sweyn). The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is silent on the visit however, so it is uncertain whether Robert visited Normandy or not, or why he did so. The entire history of the various missions which Robert is alleged to have made is confused, <b>and</b> <b>complicated</b> by propaganda claims made by Norman chroniclers after the Norman Conquest in 1066, leaving it unclear if Robert visited Normandy on his way to receive his pallium or after Godwin was in exile, or if he went twice or not at all.|$|E
5|$|Several factors {{explain the}} poor results of XXIBomber Command's {{precision}} bombing campaign. The {{most important of}} these was the weather; the American raiders frequently encountered cloudy conditions and high winds over Japan which made accurate bombing extremely difficult. Moreover, the bomber forces often had to pass through severe weather fronts between the Mariana Islands and Japan, which broke up formations and caused navigation problems. XXIBomber Command's effectiveness was also limited by poor B-29 maintenance practices and over-crowding at its airfields – these factors reduced the number of aircraft which were available for operations <b>and</b> <b>complicated</b> the process of launching and recovering the bombers. By March 1945 the USAAF's commanders were highly concerned about the failure of the campaigns mounted from China and the Mariana Islands, and believed that the results to date made it difficult to justify the high costs of the B-29 program and also threatened their goal of demonstrating the effectiveness of independent air power.|$|E
5|$|The creators' {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Monica was comedian Janeane Garofalo. Cox had {{originally}} been offered the role of Rachel but declined in favor of playing the character's best friend Monica because she was drawn to her strong personality. Meanwhile, the role of Rachel went to actress Jennifer Aniston, Cox's co-star to whom the role of Monica had originally been offered. Before Friends aired, Monica's characterization was greatly debated among writers in regards to the character sleeping with a man on their first date during the pilot. Kauffman in particular greatly defended Monica, arguing with NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer over whether or not this would make the character too promiscuous. Ultimately, the episode aired unchanged after the studio surveyed the audience, the results of which returned in favor of Monica's existing storyline. The character's struggles with childhood obesity, challenges with romantic relationships <b>and</b> <b>complicated</b> relationship with her mother would eventually become popular staples of the show.|$|E

5|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{of the genus}} and the species within has a long <b>and</b> <b>complicated</b> history. Other genera of Oligocene indricotheres, such as Baluchitherium, Indricotherium, and Dzungariotherium, have been named, but no complete specimens exist, making comparison and classification difficult. Most modern scientists consider these genera to be junior synonyms of Paraceratherium, and that it contains at least four discernible species; P. bugtiense (the type species), P. transouralicum, P. prohorovi, and P. orgosensis, although the last may be a distinct genus. The most completely-known species is P. transouralicum, so most reconstructions of the genus are based on it. Differences between P. bugtiense and P. transouralicum {{may be due to}} sexual dimorphism, which would make them the same species.|$|E
5|$|While games such as Street Fighter and Tekken require {{players to}} {{memorize}} relatively lengthy <b>and</b> <b>complicated</b> button-input combinations often specific {{to only a}} particular character, Super Smash Bros. uses the same control combinations to access all moves for all characters. Characters are additionally not limited to only facing opponents, instead being allowed to run around freely on the stage. The game focuses more on aerial and platforming skills than other fighting games, with relatively larger, more-dynamic stages rather than a simple flat platform. Smash Bros. also implements blocking and dodging mechanics. Grabbing and throwing other characters is also possible.|$|E
