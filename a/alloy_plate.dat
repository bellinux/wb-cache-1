These coatings are characterized for their structure, morphology and chemical composition by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). <b>Alloy</b> coatings <b>plated</b> at pH 8 are crystalline, whereas coatings electrodeposited at pH 5 are nanocrystalline in nature. XPS studies have demonstrated that as-deposited <b>alloy</b> <b>plated</b> at pH 8 with DC contain only Co 2 + and W 6 + species, whereas that <b>alloy</b> <b>plated</b> at pH 5 has significant amount of Co- 0 and W- 0 along with Co 2 + and W 6 + species.

Photoinduced functionality {{is provided by the}} photosensitizer of hematoporphyrin (Hp) that initially generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anion radical and singlet oxygen. The photosensitizer with carboxyl group was chemically bonded {{to the surface of the}} Co-Cr <b>alloy</b> <b>plate</b> by esterification reaction. Microstructure and elemental composition of the Co-Cr <b>alloy</b> <b>plate</b> were checked with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS).

The aluminum <b>alloy</b> <b>plate</b> girders were fabricated by welding three plates to form an I-section. A total of 118 numerical data are presented. A non-linear finite element model is developed and verified against experimental results. Geometric and material non-linearities {{were included in the}} finite element model. The welding of the aluminum <b>alloy</b> <b>plate</b> girders and the influence of the heat affected zone (HAZ) are also considered and carefully modeled. A sensitivity analysis on geometric imperfections of the aluminum <b>alloy</b> <b>plate</b> girders was performed. It was shown that the finite element model closely predicted the ultimate loads, web deformations and failure modes of aluminum <b>alloy</b> <b>plate</b> girders. Hence, the model was used for an extensive parametric study of cross-section geometries, and the web slenderness value ranged from 49 to 393. The test results and the shear resistances predicted by the finite element analysis were compared with the design strengths obtained using the European Code and American Specification for aluminum structures. Based on the experimental and numerical results, a design method for shear resistance of aluminum <b>alloy</b> <b>plate</b> girders is proposed in this study.

The effect of pre-existing twins on the mechanical properties of AZ 31 <b>alloy</b> <b>plates</b> at lower elevated temperature was investigated in the current paper. The results revealed that the twinned AZ 31 <b>alloy</b> <b>plates</b> exhibited higher strength at lower elevated temperature than the as-received plates without a large reduction in elongation, especially the yield strength increased by 36, 30 and 21 MPa at {{room temperature}}, 100 °C and 200 °C, respectively. The improved strength is attributed to the grain refinement by pre-existing { 10 – 12 } twin boundaries.
