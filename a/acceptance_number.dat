50|$|Acceptance {{sampling}} uses {{statistical sampling}} {{to determine whether}} to accept or reject a production lot of material. It has been a common quality control technique used in industry. It is usually done as products leaves the factory, {{or in some cases}} even within the factory. Most often a producer supplies a consumer a number of items and a decision to accept or reject the items is made by determining the number of defective items in a sample from the lot. The lot is accepted if the number of defects falls below where the <b>acceptance</b> <b>number</b> or otherwise the lot is rejected.|$|E

40|$|This article {{outlines}} {{the structure of}} a generalized family of three-stage chain sampling plans, extending the concept of two-stage chain sampling plans of Dodge and Stephens (1966) which is an extension of the original work of Dodge (1955). Expressions are derived for the OC curves for several sets of general sets of three-stage chain sampling plans, with cumulative <b>acceptance</b> <b>numbers</b> of (c 1,c 2,c 3) = (0, 1, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 2, 3), (1, 2, 3), (0, 1, 4), (0, 2, 4), (0, 3, 4), (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 4) and (2, 3, 4). In the original work of Dodge (1955) only <b>acceptance</b> <b>numbers</b> of 0, 1 were used and in the extension work of Dodge and Stephens (1966) <b>acceptance</b> <b>numbers</b> of (c 1,c 2) = (0,l), (0, 2), (1, 2), (0, 3), (1, 3), (0, 4) and (1, 4) were used with selected sets of values of k 1 and k 2 (the number of lots considered for cumulation in the first and second stage respectively). In this paper the OC curves are derived more generally for any k 1, k 2 and k 3 (the number of lots considered for cumulation in the first, second and third stages respectively) combination and OC curves of a number of plans are given and comparisons are made with some single sampling, two-stage chain sampling and multiple sampling plans...|$|R

40|$|Food {{additives}} are substances {{added to}} food to preserve flavor or improve its taste and appearance. Some additives {{have been used}} for centuries; for example, preserving food by pickling (with vinegar), salting, as with bacon, or using sulfur dioxide as in some wines. There are generally five main reasons why chemicals must be added to our foods: 1. To improve shelf life or storage time. 2. To make food convenient and easy to prepare. 3. To increase the nutritional value. 4. To improve the flavor of foods. 5. To enhance the attractiveness of food products and improve consumer <b>acceptance.</b> <b>Numbering</b> To regulate these additives, and inform consumers, each additive is assigned a unique number.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of chain sampling is examined through matching of operating characteristics (OC) curves of chain sampling plans (ChSP) with single and double sampling plans.

The operating ratio values reported illustrate the possibilities of matching single and double sampling plans with ChSP. It is shown that chain sampling plans provide improved efficiency over single and double sampling plans having substantially the same operating characteristics...|$|R
