40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of the illegal trade of animals is very complex. Biodiversity at large and many diverse markets, are involved. In the period 2004 - 2007, data have been analyzed on 26, 632 reports/seizures for illegal activities. It {{was found that the}} reports of illegality were made by Forces of Public Order (88 %) or by witnesses (12 %). The data we examined, showed a high incidence of poaching exerted on wildlife (86. 03 %). A high percentage of abuse has been identified in the trade for the food linked to typical gastronomy of "game" (63. 10 %), followed by the repopulation of wild animals (10. 21 %), then the sale of exotic birds (6. 66 %) or for the hobbies and amateur markets (4. 60 %). The true poaching is the smallest percentage (1. 47). Even if dogs and horses are not wild animals, they are significantly represented in the percentages of fighting between them (0. 68 %) and the clandestine racing of horses (0. 26 %), indicating the presence of the barbaric phenomenon in Italy, with consistency over time. the illegal dogs trade is emerging (7 %) and management of kennels (2 %). A lower incidence was due to lawlessness for the illegal slaughter (2 %) and for the breeding of <b>animal</b> <b>species,</b> <b>covered</b> by CITES but illegally held (1. 76 %). A lesser weight is represented by the irregularities related to the livestock (0. 02 %) and to the animal crimes (maltreatment, 0. 08 %; experiments, 0. 17 %) ...|$|E

50|$|The San Dieguito River {{watershed}} has vast areas, over 83%, of open space. As a result, {{it provides}} habitat {{for hundreds of}} plant and <b>animal</b> <b>species.</b> Vegetation <b>cover</b> ranges from pine forest {{on the slopes of}} the headwater mountains to arid grassland on the plateaus and plains further downstream. However, 18% of the basin, mostly along the shoreline, is devoted to urban areas. About 150,000 people live in the San Dieguito River watershed, but could expand to 210,000 by 2015. The lower river suffers from pollutants that affect rivers all over Southern California, mainly from E. coli bacteria from urban runoff.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{represents}} {{results from}} scientific investigation directed to examine land cover pattern in Sinite Kamani Natural Park. Studied area covers {{the territory of}} the park, which occupies 127. 3 km 2. It is situated {{in the eastern part of}} Stara Planina Mountain, including its highest peak – Bulgarka (1181 m). The park area is significant with its great biodiversity, including more than 1000 plant species and about 500 <b>animal</b> <b>species.</b> Land <b>cover</b> investigation was based on ASTER TERRA satellite image from 06. 05. 2003 with 15 m spatial resolution. Field data for land cover classification were collected in the summer of 2005. They include 23 sites from sample land cover types with information for their exact location (taken by GPS), vegetation characteristic and percentage of the different cover elements. Digital image processing was realized by ERDAS Imagine 8. 7 software. The classification scheme used was supervised maximum likelihood classifier. The resulting data were exported to Arc/CIS for thematic map producing. The classification includes 8 land cover classes. There are 4 forest classes, 1 grassland, 1 transitional and also water and barren classes. Important result from the study is the founded possibility to distinguish different kinds of deciduous forests, despite the difficulties in their differentiation. The pine forests were classified with high accuracy. Landuse classification of the Sinite Kamani Nature Park using ASTER TERRA VNIR image was satisfactory. Further field work and image processing is required to be able to produce more detailed classification of the area...|$|R
40|$|Translation of zoological terms {{occurring}} in the biblical texts, from Hebrew or Greek into Polish, {{may cause}} difficulties to translators. The aim of this paper is to show what a translator of biblical books should pay attention to, in order to remain faithful to the intentions of the inspired author and to a contemporary {{knowledge about the}} fauna of the Holy Land. In case a word in an original text of the Scripture could not be assign clearly to a certain species of animal the inspired author meant, firstly the word should be considered in a wider context of the text that is being translated. This allows, among others, to state whether the text is dealing with a wild or a domesticated animal. Then it should be answered if the natural range of this <b>animal</b> (especially wild <b>species)</b> <b>covered</b> an area of Asia Minor and North Africa in biblical times. Such knowledge brings zoogeography, a field of science which investigate and describe the change of ranges of animal species. As far as domesticated species are concerned, it is important to determine {{the time and place}} of domestication and ways of uses of domesticated animals in the area. In this case another branch of zoology, called zooarchaeology, can be helpful. Translation of zoological terms can be facilitated also by referring to structurally related to them words, used in other Semitic languages – Akkadic, Ugaritic, and Arabic, in which similar-sounding names of animals survived. Therefore, a consultation with a biblical linguist is essential to obtain an important completion to an analysis of the word, especially on natural science level. While translating, it is necessary also to take into account literary and historical context of particular biblical pericopes, which contain references to animals, what was presented on the example of translation problems with Hebrew words taḥaš and qippōd...|$|R
