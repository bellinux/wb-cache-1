Therefore, with the agreement of the Prime Minister (Clement Attlee) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Leader</b> of the Opposition (Winston Churchill) in 1946, both Orders returned to the personal gift of the Sovereign.|$|E

5|$|Youth {{spend too}} much time {{learning}} what their teachers think is important, irrelevant from what the youth may already know. The manager of learning value allows the youth to learn and practice his skills in situations simulating real life. The Manager of Learning methodology first exposes the learner to a situation to help both the learner <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> assess his current state of knowledge. This causes the learner to internalize a need to improve his knowledge or skills. This is followed by a period of teaching or exposure during which the participant improves from their base-line knowledge. The participant then gets a chance to apply what he has learned, and lastly, evaluates his performance improvement.|$|E
