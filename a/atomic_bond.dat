40|$|AbstractThe {{deformation}} work rate {{can be expressed}} by the time rate of pair functional potentials which describe the energy of materials in terms of <b>atomic</b> <b>bonds</b> and atom embedding interactions. According to Cauchy-Born rule, {{the relations between the}} microscopic deformations of <b>atomic</b> <b>bonds</b> and electron gas and macroscopic deformation are established. Further, <b>atomic</b> <b>bonds</b> are grouped according to their directions, and <b>atomic</b> <b>bonds</b> in the same direction are simplified as a spring-bundle component. Atom embedding interactions in unit reference volume are simplified as a cubage component. Consequently, a material model composed of spring-bundle components and a cubage component is established. Since the essence of damage is the decrease and loss of <b>atomic</b> <b>bonding</b> forces, the damage effect can be reflected by the response functions of these two kinds of components. Formulating the mechanical responses of two kinds of components, the corresponding elasto-damage constitutive equations are derived. Considering that slip is the main plastic deformation mechanism of polycrystalline metals, the slip systems of crystal are extended to polycrystalline, and the slip components are proposed to describe the plastic deformation. Based on the decomposition of deformation gradient and combining the plastic response with the elasto-damage one, the elasto-plastic damage constitutive equations are derived. As a result, a material model formulated with spring-bundle components, a cubage component and slip components is established. Different from phenomenological constitutive theories, the mechanical property of materials depends on the property of components rather than that directly obtained on the representative volume element. The effect of finite deformation is taken into account in this model. Parameter calibration procedure and the basic characteristics of this model are discussed...|$|R

DLC films with various <b>atomic</b> <b>bond</b> structures and compositions are finding places in orthopedic, cardiovascular, and dental applications. Cells grew on to DLC coating without any cytotoxity and inflammation. DLC coatings in orthopedic applications reduced wear, corrosion, and debris formation. DLC coating also reduced thrombogenicity by minimizing the platelet adhesion and activation. However, some contradictory results (Airoldi et al., Am J Cardiol 2004; 93 : 474 – 477, Taeger et al., Mat-wiss u Werkstofftech 2003; 34 : 1094 – 1100) were also reported that no significant improvement was observed in the performance of DLC-coated stainless stent or DLC-coated femoral head.
