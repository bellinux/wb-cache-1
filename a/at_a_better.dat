5|$|During 1948, Hutton scored heavily for Yorkshire. Despite missing {{more than}} half the County Championship matches, he scored more runs <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> average {{than anyone else in the}} side. In county matches, Hutton {{averaged}} 92.05 and scored eight centuries. Some Yorkshire critics expressed concern at the team's dependence on Hutton and the poor performance of other batsmen. Hutton's main challenge that season came from the Australian side which toured England undefeated and won the Test series 4–0. In the early part of the tour, the Australians, and particularly the pace bowlers Lindwall and Miller, tried to shake Hutton's confidence by targeting him. Although Hutton failed on a difficult pitch in Yorkshire's match against the tourists, he was the only successful batsman against them when he appeared for MCC shortly after.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes {{played for}} Gala Cricket Club in 1896 and 1897, as an all-rounder {{who opened the}} batting and bowled medium paced seamers. He took 92 wickets in his first season, and {{discovered}} that bowling an occasional slow ball brought him some success. He decided to change his bowling style to spin, and spent the winter of 1896–97 practising on the family farm while also working again on the railway, this time as a signalman. Over several months, Rhodes used his practice sessions to develop control of spin and different types of delivery. Consequently, {{in his second season}} at Galashiels, now bowling slow left-arm, he took fewer wickets but <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> average. At the end of the 1897 season, encouraged by a Scottish member of the MCC, he resigned from Gala to look for work in England.|$|E
25|$|Muralitharan took 795 wickets for {{his country}} Sri Lanka in 132 tests. The next most wickets for Sri Lanka in these 132 Tests was Chaminda Vaas' 309 – less than 40% of the spinner's pile. No one else managed 100. Collectively Sri Lankan bowlers tallied 1968 wickets across that span, of which Muralitharan {{accounted}} for 40.4%. Among the 24 other Sri Lankans who took more than 10 of those wickets, only Lasith Malinga did so <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> strike rate (52.3) than Muralitharan's 54.9 – and the latter bowled rather more overs, 6657.1 {{of them to be}} precise.|$|E

25|$|The company's decline {{was partly}} {{arrested by the}} Natives on Private Estates Ordinance 1928, which made rents in cash or kind an {{alternative}} to labour under thangata. After Sanderson died, he was replaced by Captain Kincaid-Smith, who became general manager in 1931. Kincaid-Smith was able to acquire large quantities of tenants’ tobacco, as 150 pounds (about 70 kilograms) of dark-fired leaf was required to satisfy their annual rent; he also bought amounts in excess of rents in kind, deferring payment until the tobacco was sold. The value of this tobacco was well {{in excess of the}} cash rent, and in theory, tenants could only sell to the Bruce Estates, but some tobacco was sold <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> price elsewhere by claiming it was smallholder produced. Curing tobacco required large amounts of firewood, and by 1945 the estate was severely deforested.|$|E
25|$|In February 1997, Antestor {{recorded}} a promo-CD titled Kongsblod at Studio 5, Oslo. The recording and mixing process took approximately 90 hours. At the time their line up consisted of guitarist/keyboardist Lars Stokstad (Vemod), vocalist/lyricist Kjetil Molnes (Martyr), bass player Vegard Undal and drummer Svein Sander (Armoth). The band sent Kongsblod to record labels {{in hopes of}} getting finances to record and mix <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> quality studio. The cover of the demo contains a famous Norwegian painting of skiing Vikings (Birkebeinerne, by Knud Bergslien). One of the biggest exclusively black metal focused British labels, Cacophonous Records, {{became interested in the}} band, and a record deal was signed with Antestor. However, Cacophonous simply released Kongsblod after changing the cover to a painting by the American fantasy artist Joe Petagno, and the name was changed to The Return of the Black Death. The album was released on September 14, 1998.|$|E

Total Sci-Fi Online rated the episode 7/10, and expressed the wish that [...] "Safe" [...] could have been used as the series' pilot. [...] "The central premise has more pull, it draws together various plot strands going back to the pilot, meaningfully involves several seemingly incidental characters and events from the past, and zips along <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> pace. It’s a shame it took this long to reach this part of the puzzle, where a few of the pieces at last click satisfyingly into place".

500|$|Kariya {{was known}} for his skilled and {{entertaining}} style of play. An offensive player, he was a fast skater with strong puck-handling and passing abilities. Prior to and early in his NHL career, Kariya drew comparisons to Wayne Gretzky. During the 1994 Winter Olympics, American Head Coach Tim Taylor likened his skating and playmaking ability to Gretzky's, while Kariya's linemate, Chris Kontos, described his on-ice vision as [...] "Gretzky-like." [...] Canadian Head Coach Tom Renney heralded him as [...] "think and play <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> speed than anybody else," [...] adding that his teammates [...] "are usually a half-step behind him." [...] His speed made him particularly adept in international competition, as games were played on a larger ice surface in comparison to the NHL. Following his first NHL goal against Winnipeg, Jets Head Coach John Paddock told reporters, [...] "like with Gretzky the puck seems to following him around... It looks like he's cherry-picking, but he's not. That's just great instinct." [...] Kariya himself cited Gretzky, as well as Brett Hull, Jeremy Roenick and Pavel Bure as players he liked patterning his game after. Kariya was also recognized for his [...] "hockey sense" [...] and the cerebral aspect of his game, which included analyzing the game at a high level. His first NHL coach, Ron Wilson, also once described Kariya as [...] "the hardest-working athlete [...] ever been associated with." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{completion}} of his studies at Sherborne School, Bastard attended Wadham College, Oxford University. He {{played in the}} Freshmen's Trial in May 1882, and collected four wickets in each innings, conceding just 35 runs from his 29 overs. His side, LML Owen's XI won by 79 runs. He played in two matches against the university's first team during his freshman year, opening the bowling for both the Freshmen side and the [...] "Next XVI". He made his debut in first-class cricket that June, appearing for the university against the Marylebone Cricket Club. He claimed one wicket during the match, in which the university lost by an innings. Bastard appeared three times in first-class cricket for the university in 1883, and according to Geoffrey Bolton, author of History of the O.U.C.C, [...] "was lucky to be chosen this year" [...] {{to play in the}} University match against Cambridge University. Bastard was wicketless against Lancashire, and although he took three wickets in each innings against the MCC, John Foord-Kelcey took more wickets <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> average. Nevertheless, Bastard was preferred for the contest against Cambridge, thus gaining his Blue. Bastard claimed a wicket in each innings of the match, which Cambridge won by seven wickets. Bolton attributes the loss to a combination of the weather and Oxford's loss of the toss, which resulted in Cambridge batting first on a good batting pitch. Rain followed, and when Oxford batted, the pitch was described by Bolton as [...] "really nasty".|$|E
