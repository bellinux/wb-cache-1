5|$|The first {{mention of}} the ring-tailed lemur in Western {{literature}} came in 1625 when English traveler and writer Samuel Purchas described them as being comparable in size to <b>a</b> <b>monkey</b> and having a fox-like long tail with black and white rings.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts with}} Farmer slowly walking in an {{laboratory}} {{in which many}} animals are captive to serve as experiments. Depicting a supernatural creature, the singer approaches every cage {{to look at all}} the animals — pigeons, cats, bobcats, rabbits, mouses, a snake, an owl, <b>a</b> <b>monkey,</b> a doe — and heals them with her magic hands. Then she takes a wounded little cat out of its cage and puts it on her shoulders. During the second refrain, she remains standing with closed eyes {{in the middle of the}} room and uses her supernatural powers to explode all of the glass cages. She thus releases the animals and, with <b>a</b> <b>monkey</b> in her arms, leads them outside into the woods. Standing in the forest, she closes her eyes again and sends many rays of light from her hands. The last scene shows the Earth being covered by that light.|$|E
5|$|This is {{not always}} the case, however. In sexually dimorphic species, one sex may be more of a threat than the other, which could mimic the {{protected}} sex. Evidence for this possibility is provided by the behaviour of <b>a</b> <b>monkey</b> from Gabon, which regularly ate male moths of the genus Anaphe, but promptly stopped after it tasted a noxious female.|$|E

5|$|Belgian {{reporter}} Tintin {{and his dog}} Snowy {{travel to}} the Belgian Congo, where a cheering crowd of native Congolese greet them. Tintin hires a native boy, Coco, to assist him in his travels, and shortly after, Tintin rescues Snowy from a crocodile.

5|$|By 1986, {{the company}} was once again in serious {{financial}} trouble. During 1985 they had taken the show outside Quebec to a lukewarm response. In Toronto they performed {{in front of a}} 25% capacity crowd after not having enough money to properly market the show. Gilles Ste-Croix, dressed in <b>a</b> <b>monkey</b> suit, walked through downtown Toronto as a desperate publicity stunt. A later stop in Niagara Falls turned out to be equally problematic.|$|E

5|$|In the Thai Ramakien, Hanuman helps Vibhishana (here called Phipek) kill a demon. Hanuman then marries Trijata (Benchakai); {{their union}} {{results in the}} birth of a son, Asurapada, a demon with <b>a</b> <b>monkey</b> head. In the Malay version, after the great war, Vibhishana {{requests}} that Hanuman wed his daughter Trijata (Seri Jati). Hanuman agrees, on the condition that he remain with her for only a month. While Hanuman leaves for Ayodhya with Rama, Trijata gives birth to his son Hanuman Tegangga (Asurapada). The Javanese and Sundanese Wayang puppet tradition also portrays Trijata as the wife of Hanuman.|$|E
5|$|Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet! (released internationally as They Say I'm <b>a</b> <b>Monkey!)</b> is a 2008 Indonesian film {{directed}} by Djenar Maesa Ayu. Starring Titi Rajo Bintang, Henidar Amroe, and Ray Sahetapi, {{it tells the}} life story of Adjeng, who was sexually abused as a child by her mother's boyfriend. Filmed over 18days {{after several years of}} development, the film adapted two of Ayu's short stories from her debut anthology of the same name. Owing to its low budget of Rp620 million, its cast and crew were mostly amateurs and students, although several established actors appeared at reduced rates.|$|E
5|$|The gharial is {{featured}} in the folk tales of India. In one story, a gharial and <b>a</b> <b>monkey</b> become friends when the monkey gives the gharial fruit. The gharial's wife demands that her husband bring home the monkey to eat, believing that the fruit made the monkey's heart sweet. The gharial complies at first and attempts to lure the monkey to his home, but soon comes clean about the plan. Their friendship ends after that. Similar stories exist in Native American legends, and in the African American folktale of an alligator and Br'er Rabbit.|$|E

5000|$|The term monkey's uncle, {{most notably}} {{seen in the}} idiom [...] "(well) I'll be <b>a</b> <b>monkey's</b> uncle", is used to express {{complete}} surprise, amazement or disbelief. It {{can also be used}} to acknowledge the impossibility of a situation, in the same way that [...] "pigs might fly" [...] is used. An example is if one says: [...] "I may agree that if two plus two equals five, then I am <b>a</b> <b>monkey's</b> uncle". [...] "I'll be <b>a</b> <b>monkey's</b> uncle" [...] has been said to date from after 1925, the date of the widely publicized Scopes Trial in the United States, where the term first appears. The Oxford English Dictionary's earliest example is the phrase If that's a joke I'm <b>a</b> <b>monkey's</b> uncle, from <b>an</b> Ohio newspaper on 8 February 1925. It was originally a sarcastic remark made by creationists. The notion [...] "that people were descended from apes was considered blasphemous...by Darwin's contemporaries", and it was for this reason that the sarcastic phrase came into use.|$|R

5|$|According to a {{traditional}} account, Hanuman went to Valmiki numerous times to hear him sing the Ramayana, but Valmiki turned down the request saying that Hanuman being <b>a</b> <b>monkey</b> was unworthy of hearing the epic. After the victory of Rama over Ravana, Hanuman went to the Himalayas to continue his worship of Rama. There he scripted a play version of the Ramayana called Mahanataka or Hanuman Nataka engraved on the Himalayan rocks using his nails. When Valmiki saw the play written by Hanuman, he anticipated that {{the beauty of the}} Mahanataka would eclipse his own Ramayana. Hanuman was saddened at Valmiki's state of mind and, being a true bhakta without any desire for glory, Hanuman cast all the rocks into the ocean, some parts of which are believed to be available today as Hanuman Nataka. After this, Valmiki was instructed by Hanuman to take birth as Tulsidas and compose the Ramayana in the vernacular.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of George IV in 1830, a {{decision}} was made to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of the stock was moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828. The last of the animals left in 1835, relocated to Regent's Park. This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by <b>a</b> <b>monkey.</b> The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until {{the death of}} Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.|$|E
5|$|Broccoli had {{originally}} hired Richard Maibaum {{and his friend}} Wolf Mankowitz to write Dr. Nos screenplay, partly because of Mankowitz's help in brokering the deal between Broccoli and Saltzman. An initial draft of the screenplay was rejected because the scriptwriters had made the villain, Dr. No, <b>a</b> <b>monkey.</b> Mankowitz left the movie, and Maibaum then undertook a second version, more closely {{in line with the}} novel. Mankowitz eventually had his name removed from the credits after viewing early rushes, as he feared it would be a disaster. Johanna Harwood and thriller writer Berkely Mather then worked on Maibaum's script. Terence Young described Harwood as a script doctor who helped put elements more in tune with a British character. Harwood stated in an interview in a Cinema Retro special on the making of the film that she had been a screenwriter of several of Harry Saltzman's projects; and claimed both her screenplays for Dr. No and her screenplay for From Russia with Love had followed Fleming's novels closely.|$|E

One theory {{on the origin}} of this unique name is that, when looking at a map of Ballard County, it resembles <b>a</b> <b>monkey's</b> head. Monkey's Eyebrow is located where the monkey's eyebrow would be located. It has also been said that, when viewed from a nearby hill, the shape of the town resembles <b>a</b> <b>monkey's</b> eyebrow.|$|R

5|$|On 2 October 1920, King Alexander was {{bitten by}} <b>a</b> <b>monkey</b> during {{a walk through}} the gardens at Tatoi. The wound became {{infected}} and Alexander developed septicemia. On 19 October, he began to rave and called his mother at his bedside but the Greek government refused to allow Queen Sophia to return to Greece. Worried about her son, and knowing that his grandmother {{was the only other}} royal still in favor with the Venizelists, Sophia asked Olga to go to Athens to care for Alexander. After several days of negotiations, the dowager queen obtained permission to return to Greece but, delayed by rough seas, she arrived twelve hours after her grandson's death on 25 October. On 29 October, Alexander was buried at Tatoi; Olga was {{the only member of the}} royal family at the funeral.|$|E
5|$|Patrice {{begins the}} show, {{explaining}} that he will use memories and objects relating to Rémi to perform. He says that Rémi loved ventriloquism, and performs his own routine with <b>a</b> <b>monkey</b> puppet called Falzouille, in which the puppet never speaks. He talks about how the puppet is not alive as it has Velcro pads, and imitates a cat and mouse with Velcro on their paws. He tells a story of when he removed the batteries from his colleague's calculator, then takes out Rémi's notebook, which contains the telephone numbers of prostitutes and vomit stains. Patrice performs a shadow puppetry routine in which an Armenian soldier rescues his daughter from 25 duduk players. It becomes clear that Patrice is not actually making the shadows, and he gets annoyed at three stagehands called David.|$|E
5|$|The {{person was}} first whipped, or beaten, with virgis sanguinis ("blood-colored rods", probably), {{and his head}} was clad/covered in a bag made of a wolf's hide. On his feet were placed clogs, or wooden shoes, and he was then put into the poena cullei, a sack made of ox-leather. Placed along with him into the sack was also an {{assortment}} of live animals, arguably the most famous combination being that of a serpent, a cock, <b>a</b> <b>monkey</b> and a dog. The sack was put on a cart, and the cart driven by black oxen to a running stream or to the sea. Then, the sack with its inhabitants was thrown into the water.|$|E
