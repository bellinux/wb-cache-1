40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new question expanding method for question classification in cQA services. Input questions are mostly {{generated by a}} small size of text in the cQA services, and test inputs consist of only a question whereas training data do a pair of question and answer. Thus, the input questions cannot provide enough information for good classification in many cases. To solve this problem, we propose the question expanding method by pseudo relevant feedback and <b>automatic</b> <b>answer</b> generation. For pseudo relevant feedback, we first find relevant question-answer pairs related to an input question using the Indri search engine, and then top relevant words are chosen as expanded words. The <b>automatic</b> <b>answer</b> generation tries to create pseudo answers by adding question-related words using translation probabilities from questions to answers by Giza++. As a result, we obtain the significant improved performances when two approaches are effectively combined...|$|R

5000|$|Most 20th century {{answering}} machines used {{magnetic recording}} which Valdemar Poulsen invented in 1898. [...] The {{creation of the}} first practical <b>automatic</b> <b>answering</b> device for telephones, however, is in dispute. Clarence Hickman worked for Bell Laboratories from 1930 where he developed methods for the magnetic recording and working on the recognition of speech patterns and electromechanical switching systems. In 1934, he developed a tape-based answering machine which phone company AT&T, {{as the owner of}} Bell Laboratories, kept under wraps for years for fear that an answering machine would result in fewer telephone calls. Many claim it was William Muller in 1935, {{but it could have been}} created already in 1931 by William Schergens whose device used phonographic cylinders. Ludwig Blattner promoted a telephone answering machine in 1929 based on his Blattnerphone magnetic recording technology. In 1935 inventor Benjamin Thornton developed a machine to record voice messages from the caller. The device reportedly also was able to keep track of the time the recordings were made. Although many sources maintain that he invented it in 1935, Thornton had actually filed a patent in 1930 (Number 1831331) for this machine, which utilized a phonographic record as the recording medium.|$|E

50|$|Over {{the past}} 150 years, {{people with disabilities}} were barely {{acknowledged}} {{in the creation of}} telecommunication. One little known fact is that when Alexander Graham Bell first invented the telephone he intended to create it for the use of deaf people. Many people are unaware of this fact because most financial and political decisions in our society are made by people who are not disabled. Eventually, installing phones in every building in most Western countries became a nationwide goal. However, these phones were virtually impossible for deaf people to use. Also, accessibility to telecommunication {{is an important factor in}} aiding the disabled, thereby considerations such as making payphones large enough to accommodate wheelchairs and telephones with large buttons to aid people with dexterity problems. Accessibility to telecommunications was not a major concern until the 1990s with the creation of the mobile phone and the 1996 Telecommunications Act which ensured that all telecommunication technology be available to disabled people. However, this Act did not ensure that disabled people could gain access to these technologies. This quote by Goggin and Newell explains the effect of the old telecommunication technology and the new technology such as mobile phones on the social construction of disability: “Not only are our scientific and technological enquiries (sic) manifestly both very productive and very destructive, but we will inevitably come to depend on them to resolve the very contradictions they have created.” The creation of the mobile phone in the 1990s both opened and closed doors for the disabled. With the creation of text messaging, the deaf were finally able to enter into the world of telecommunication. However, a disadvantage of the second generation mobile phones was that they caused hearing aid malfunctions due to a high level of electromagnetic interference. The phones would cause hearing aids to emit a buzzing noise which made if extremely difficult to hear and communicate. If the phone companies would have considered disability in the creation of the new phones, this would not have been a problem. However since this was not the case, the companies were forced to consider redesigning the phones. Thus, the wireless access protocol (WAP) was manufactured, a 2.5 G (generational) mobile phone and then the 3G phone. However, the 3 G phone has also proven to cause some interference with hearing aids and also because the phone is a smaller in size it can be harder to operate for disabled people. In addition, voice-mail, <b>automatic</b> <b>answering,</b> call progression announcements and the internet are unhelpful to the visually impaired as they require sight to be able to operate.|$|E

40|$|International audienceParticipation in {{strategic}} and non-strategic games is mostly {{explained in the}} literature by gender: men gamble on strategic games, while women gamble on non-strategic games. However, {{little is known about}} the underlying cognitive factors that could also distinguish strategic and non-strategic gamblers. We suggest that cognitive style and need for cognition also explain participation in gambling subtypes. From a dualprocess perspective, cognitive style is the tendency to reject or accept the fast, <b>automatic</b> <b>answer</b> that comes immediately in response to a problem. Individuals that preferentially reject the automatic response use an analytic style, which suggest processing information in a slow way, with deep treatment. The intuitive style supposes a reliance on fast, <b>automatic</b> <b>answers.</b> The need for cognition provides a motivation to engage in effortful activities. One hundred and forty-nine gamblers (53 strategic and 96 non-strategic) answered the Cognitive Reflection Test, Need For Cognition Scale, and socio-demographic questions. A logistic regression was conducted to evaluate the influence of gender, cognitive style and need for cognition on participation {{in strategic}} and non-strategic games. Our results show that a model with both gender and cognitive variables is more accurate than a model with gender alone. Analytic (vs. intuitive) style, high (vs. low) need for cognition and being male (vs. female) are characteristics of strategic gamblers (vs. non-strategic gamblers). This study highlights the importance of considering the cognitive characteristics of strategic and non-strategic gamblers in order to develop preventive campaigns and treatments that fit the best profiles for gamblers...|$|R
40|$|Short answer {{questions}} for reading comprehension {{are a common}} task in foreign language learning. <b>Automatic</b> short <b>answer</b> scoring is the task of automatically assessing the semantic content of a student’s answer, marking it e. g. as correct or incorrect. While previous approaches mainly focused on comparing a learner answer to some reference answer provided by the teacher, we explore {{the use of the}} underlying reading texts as additional evidence for the classification. First, we conduct a corpus study targeting the links between sentences in reading texts for learners of German and answers to reading comprehension questions based on those texts. Second, we use the reading text directly for classification, considering three different models: an answer-based classifier extended with textual features, a simple text-based classifier, and a model that combines the two according to confidence of the text-based classification. The most promising approach is the first one, results for which show that textual features improve classification accuracy. While the other two models do not improve classification accuracy, they do investigate the role of the text and suggest possibilities for developing <b>automatic</b> <b>answer</b> scoring systems with less supervision needed from instructors. ...|$|R
