However, the mechanisms conferring neuroprotection and neuroregeneration downstream to these signals are unclear. We now {{reveal that the}} scaffold protein muscle A-kinase anchoring protein-α (mAKAPα) {{is required for the}} survival and axon growth of cultured primary RGCs. Although genetic deletion of mAKAPα early in prenatal RGC development did not affect RGC survival into adulthood, nor promoted the death of RGCs in the uninjured adult retina, loss of mAKAPα in the adult increased RGC death after optic nerve crush. Importantly, mAKAPα was required for the neuroprotective effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and cyclic <b>adenosine-monophosphate</b> (cAMP) after injury. These results identify mAKAPα as a scaffold for signaling in the stressed neuron that is required for RGC neuroprotection after optic nerve injury...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Currently, in {{transplantation}} medicine {{an important}} {{risk factor for}} long-term graft rejection is cold-ischemia derived tissue-injury, occurring during prolonged organ preservation. The main consequences of cold-ischemia are ATP-depletion, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. In recent decades growing {{attention has been paid}} to ischemic preconditioning (IP) as a phenomenon to induce cold-ischemia tolerance in organs. By exposing organs to a brief ischemic period before the prolonged cold-ischemic period, several protecting mechanisms are induced on the cellular level. The <b>adenosine-monophosphate</b> kinase (AMPK) has recently been discovered to play a central role in the IP mechanism. Therefore, in this review I outlined the similarities of the IP and AMPK effector mechanisms, thereby presenting a possible common way of action, but also outlining the AMPK specific role as regulator of metabolism. As several studies reveal an energy-saving, anti-inflammatory and indirect endothelium protecting effect of AMPK, targeting this kinase could be a promising strategy in future pharmacological preconditioning. Moreover, in this review I propose the AMPK-agonists AICAR and 5 ’AMP as possible candidates in the protection of organs against prolonged cold-ischemic preservation. ...|$|E
40|$|Prolonged {{increase}} of cyclic <b>adenosine-monophosphate</b> (cAMP) {{level in the}} culture medium of a well differentiated human prostatic cancer cell (LNCaP) inhibits cellular growth and stimulates PSA secretion. The differentiation of the cells tested was documented by their responsiveness to androgens {{and the ability to}} synthesize cellular markers of differentiation (PSA). The raise in cAMP level was produced by dibutyryl cyclic AMP (DBcAMP) or by agents acting at distinct levels in the pathway of cAMP generation (forskolin) or degradation (IBMX). Each of these three agents in a range of concentrations between 10 - 4 - 10 - 6 M had an inhibitory effect on the growth which is dose and time-dependent. The inhibition was reversible as demonstrated by complete restoration of cell growth soon after the withdrawal of the substances from the culture medium. When cAMP levels in culture medium was raised, an increase in PSA content was observed. However, the effects of cAMP on PSA content was not due to increase in PSA synthesis, since simultaneous measurement of secreted and cellular PSA indicated that the principal effect of the cyclic nucleotide was to enhance the secretion of stored PSA.

40|$|Patients with genetic defects of the cyclic (c) <b>adenosine-monophosphate</b> (AMP) -signaling pathway {{and those}} with neonatal-onset multisystem {{inflammatory}} disease (NOMID) develop tumor-like lesions of the long bones. The molecular basis of this similarity is unknown. NOMID is caused by inappropriate caspase- 1 activity, which in turn activates the inflammasome. The present study demonstrates that NOMID bone lesions are derived from the same osteoblast progenitor cells that form fibroblastoid tumors in mice and humans with defects that lead to increased cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. NOMID tumor cells showed high PKA activity, {{and an increase in}} their cAMP signaling led to PKA-specific activation of caspase- 1. Increased PKA led to inflammation-independent activation of caspase- 1 via over-expression of the proto-oncogene (and early osteoblast factor) Ets- 1. In NOMID tumor cells, as in cells with defective PKA regulation, increased prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) led to increased cAMP levels and activation of Wnt signaling, like in other states of inappropriate PKA activity. Caspase- 1 and PGE 2 inhibition led to a decrease in cell proliferation of both NOMID and cells with abnormal PKA. These data reveal a previously unsuspected link between abnormal cAMP signaling and defective regulation of the inflammasome and suggest that caspase- 1 and PGE 2 inhibition may be therapeutic targets in bone lesions associated with defects of these two pathways...|$|E

The raise in cAMP level was produced by dibutyryl cyclic AMP (DBcAMP) or by forskolin an agent acting {{at the level of}} cAMP generation. Both these agents in a range of concentration between 10 - 3 - 10 - 5 M have an inhibitory effect on the growth which is dose and time dependent. The inhibition was reversible as demonstrated by complete restoration of cell growth soon after the withdrawal of the substances from the culture medium. When cAMP levels in culture medium was raised, an increase in Ca 19 - 9 expression was observed and it appears that cyclic nucleotides have at least two effects: the first to cause rapid release of already synthesized Ca 19 - 9 and second to stimulate new antigen synthesis. The findings of the present study demonstrated that LS 174 T cells are unable to proliferate upon sustained accumulation of intracellular cyclic AMP suggesting the use of strategies able to increase cAMP levels for therapy of colon cancer. Furthermore, the finding that cAMP may also be a regulator of Ca 19 - 9 synthesis and release indicates the utility of cell line LS 174 T as a model for studies on the mechanism of synthesis and secretion of specific tumoral markers in colon cance...|$|E

Following transcriptional and translational profiling of intestinal tissue that revealed a prominent induction of murine CD 73, we next determined the role of CD 73 in protection against intestinal IR injury.

To confirm the role of CD 73 in intestinal adenosine production, we measured adenosine tissue levels and found that they were increased with IR injury. In contrast, CD 73 -deficient (cd 73 −/−) mice had lower adenosine levels at baseline and no increase with IR injury. Finally, reconstitution of cd 73 −/− mice or treatment of wild-type mice with soluble 5 ′-nucleotidase was associated with significantly lower levels of injury. These data reveal a previously unrecognized role of CD 73 in attenuating intestinal IR-mediated injury. —Hart, M. L., Henn, M., Köhler, D., Kloor, D., Mittelbronn, M., Gorzolla, I. C., Stahl, G.

40|$|Adenosine-triphosphate (ATP), {{adenosine}}-diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine itself {{have been}} identified as intercellular signaling molecules. The endothelial cell nucleoside-triphosphate-diphosphohydrolase 1 (NTPDase 1 /CD 39) effectively hydrolyzes extracellular ATP and ADP to <b>adenosine-monophosphate</b> (AMP), while the ubiquitary 5 -nucleotidase (5 -NT) further hydrolyzes AMP to adenosine. The rapid cellular uptake of circulating adenosine is maintained by transporting proteins. In the sequel of ischemia-reperfusion, a loss of NTPDase activity has been documented in several organs. Therefore, a local increase of ADP concentration has been suggested, that leads to increased platelet activation and promotes the ischemia-reperfusion-injury. The supplementation of soluble NTPDase may interrupt this process. Although alkaline phosphatase is the predominant nucleotidase of the liver, NTPDase 1 plays also a crucial role for its ischemic tolerance, as experimental cd 39 -deficiency can partly be compensated by application of soluble NTPDase or adenosine/amrinone. In the jejunum, NTPDase 1 accounts {{for more than half of}} the global nucleotidase activity. During the early phase of reperfusion, intestinal vascular structures of wildtype mice demonstrate a significant drop of NTPDase activity followed by a complete reconstitution within 60 minutes. In a xenogenic cardiac transplantation model with additional preservation injury and ongoing immunological insults, reconstitution is significantly delayed. Moreover, vascular permeability assays demonstrate an increased susceptibility of cd 39 -null mice for intestinal injury. The supplementation with soluble NTPDase or adenosine/amrinone reduces this effect. Consequently, substitution of soluble NTPDase in murine intestinal ischemia-reperfusion models decreases the ischemia-reperfusion-injury and minimizes platelet adhesion in post-capillary venules. The application of adenosine/amrinone alone, however, does not increase survival rates. In conclusion, vascular NTPDase exerts a dual action in post-ischemic tissues, that reduces plateletendothelial cell-interactions and decreases vascular permeability. Both effects may be beneficial in solid organ transplantation as well as in arterial occlusive disease or chronic inflammation...|$|E
40|$|The cyclic <b>adenosine-monophosphate</b> (cAMP) pathway is {{generally}} {{recognized as one}} of the essential pathways for the adipose conversion of rodent preadipocytes in vitro. However, divergent effects of cAMP on adipocyte differentiation have also been reported. Since there is very little data on non-rodent preadipose cells, the aim of the present work was to analyze the effects of classic activators of the cAMP pathway on the proliferation and differentiation of porcine preadipocytes grown either in serum-free or in serum-containing medium. In both media, the addition of 10 microM forskolin from day 1 after cell plating to day 3 or 7 did not affect cell proliferation. Such stimulations also failed to enhance preadipocyte differentiation, as assessed by the measurement of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and glycerol 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activities, two markers of adipose conversion. Similar results were obtained when various concentrations of forskolin (0. 1 nM- 100 microM) were added for 2 days either during the growth phase (days 1 - 3) or after confluence (days 5 - 7). Addition of methylisobutylxanthine (MIX) or 8 -bromo-cAMP was also found inefficient to stimulate porcine preadipocytes differentiation clearly. By contrast, post-confluence treatment of the murine 3 T 3 -L 1 cell line with either forskolin or MIX markedly enhanced lipid accumulation and led to a dramatic increase in GPDH activity (up to 120 times). This indicates that similar culture conditions are adipogenic for the murine 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes but not for porcine preadipose cells. In summary, this work clearly highlights the finding that porcine preadipocytes do not respond to classic activators of the cAMP pathway like rodent cells do. This calls in question again the general model proposed for the action of this pathway in adipose conversion and suggests that the mechanisms regulating adipocyte differentiation may differ among species...|$|E
40|$|Background The TH 2 -like cytokines {{interleukin}} (IL) - 4 and IL- 5 play {{a pivotal}} role in airway wall inflammation in asthma and these cytokines are increased in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from asthmatic patients. It is unclear why specifically TH 2 -like cytokines are increased in asthmatic patients. A possible explanation may be an impaired adenylyl cyclase activity, which has been observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of asthmatics. Objective To assess interferon (IFN) -gamma, IL- 4 and IL- 5 mRNA expressions and their control by prostaglandin E- 2 (PGE(2)), which activates adenylyl cyclases, of peripheral T lymphocytes from patients with moderately severe asthma and healthy controls. Methods Peripheral blood T lymphocytes from asthmatics and healthy controls were isolated and stimulated with antibodies against CD 3 plus CD 28 in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of PGE(2). IFN-gamma, IL- 4 and IL- 5 mRNA levels were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Results In contrast to IFN-gamma mRNA, IL- 4 (P = 0. 03, n = 8) and IL- 5 (P < 0. 05, n = 5) mRNAs in the asthma group were significantly higher than in controls (n = 4). In addition, IL- 5 showed a significant inverse correlation with forced expiratory volume (FEV 1) (P < 0. 04, n = 5), whereas IL- 4 positively correlated with PC(20) <b>adenosine-monophosphate</b> (AMP) (P < 0. 02, n = 8). Accumulation of mRNA for IFN-gamma, IL- 4 and IL- 5 mRNA were significantly diminished by 10 (- 5) M PGE(2) in both asthmatics and controls. In contrast, 10 (- 6) M PGE(2) significantly down-regulated IFN-gamma and IL- 4 mRNAs (P < 0. 05 for both IFN-gamma and IL- 4 n = 4) in the control group, whereas this was not observed for IL- 4 mRNA in the asthma group (n = 7). Conclusions Activated peripheral blood T lymphocytes from asthma patients display higher levels of IL- 4 and IL- 5 mRNA in vitro, which may be due to a diminished activity of adenylyl cyclase. A new;observation is that higher IL- 4 mRNA levels are associated with less severe AMP responsiveness, which might be due to a negative feedback loop of IL- 4 production by mast cells...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} pathophysiologic {{mechanisms of}} the predominantly nocturnal complaints in atopic bronchial asthma, the expression {{and function of}} beta 2 -adrenoceptors on peripheral mononuclear leukocytes (pMNL), the cAMP [...] {{as well as the}} cortisol [...] plasma concentrations were studied in eight healthy men and ten so far untreated male asthmatic patients at 4 -h intervals for 24 h. No difference was seen in the beta 2 -adrenoceptor density (Bmax) on pMNL between healthy and asthmatic men (24 -h means +/- SE: 908 +/- 59 sites per cell and 821 +/- 54 sites per cell, respectively). The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd), however, was significantly higher in the asthmatic patients (24 -h mean +/- SE: 8. 8 +/- 1. 2 pmol/L vs 3. 0 +/- 0. 2 pmol/L in healthy men, p less than 0. 0001), which is equivalent to a lower affinity of the beta 2 -adrenoceptors for the radioligand 125 iodocyanopindolol. Bmax showed a statistically significant circadian variation, but Kd did not. The circadian variation in Bmax was reflected in the basal intracellular cyclic <b>adenosine-monophosphate</b> (cAMP) content of the cells investigated. High Kd values (equivalent to low receptor affinities) tended to be associated with small increases of the intracellular cAMP content after in vitro stimulation by 10 (- 7) mol/L isoprenaline (isoproterenol) (24 -h mean +/- SE: 1. 4 +/- 0. 2 pmol/ 10 (6) cells; r = - 0. 529, p = 0. 05 at r = - 0. 549, n = 10). Plasma cAMP concentrations were found to be significantly lower in the asthmatic patients (24 -h means +/- SE: 22. 9 +/- 1. 3 nmol/L vs 29. 1 +/- 1. 1 nmol/L, p less than 0. 0001). Plasma cortisol concentrations were significantly higher in the asthmatic patients (24 -h means +/- SE: 0. 500 +/- 0. 084 mumol/L vs 0. 319 +/- 0. 063 mumol/L). The results support the hypothesis that a lesion of the beta-adrenergic system contributes to the pathophysiology of atopic bronchial asthma. In the patients investigated in this study, such a lesion could be demonstrated in the affinity rather than in the number of beta 2 -adrenoceptors expressed on peripheral cells of the immune system (pMNL). According to present-day knowledge of adrenergic effects on pMNL, such an affinity decrease of beta 2 -adrenoceptors could account for overshooting immune responses. In association with other factors influencing respiratory function, it could be responsible for the predominantly nocturnal complaints in atopic bronchial asthma. Plasma cortisol concentrations {{did not appear to be}} related to the principal cause of "nocturnal asthma;" they rather reflected an endogenous defense mechanism to the disease...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{phosphorus}} {{is potentially}} {{an important source}} of phosphorus (P) for agriculture, although it is not directly available for plant or microbial uptake. However, organic P can be converted into available inorganic P though hydrolysis or mineralisation. The rate of P release from organic P forms depends partly on the specific organic P compounds present in the soil. Until recently characterising soil organic P has been limited by the lack of appropriate analytic techniques. Consequently, organic P dynamics remains poorly understood. In this thesis, the focus was on improving techniques for the characterisation of soil organic P using solution ³¹P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, applying these techniques to characterise a range of Australian soils and developing {{a better understanding of the}} cycling and potential bioavailability of soil organic P. The characterisation of soil organic P relies on the correct identification of resonances. Orthophosphate monoester peaks were identified by spiking model organic P compounds into NaOH- EDTA soil extracts. In this way, seven major resonances that were common to most of the NMR spectra were assigned to <b>adenosine-monophosphate</b> (AMP), scyllo-inositol hexakisphosphate, α- and β-glycerophosphate and myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (phytate). More importantly, spiking highlighted the similarly in appearance and chemical shift of some of the orthophosphate monoester resonances, particularly those of phytate and α- and β-glycerophosphate. This may have resulted in the misidentification and over-estimation of the concentrations of these species in previous studies. To provide a detailed quantitative assessment of soil organic P using ³¹P NMR spectroscopy, a modified method of spectral deconvolution, which included using an internal standard (methylenediphosphonic acid; MDP), was developed. The method of deconvolution implemented in this thesis considered P contained in larger humic molecules. A broad signal, in addition to the routinely fitted sharp peaks, was fitted to the orthophosphate monoester region of the NMR spectrum. A large proportion of monoester P (32 – 78 %) could be assigned to this signal. When the broad signal was not taken into account phytate concentrations were over-estimated by 54 %. It is likely that the concentrations of other specific orthophosphate monoester compounds were also over-estimated. The potential over-estimation of phytate concentrations has implication for the understanding of phytate stability in soils. High phytate concentrations in soils are usually explained by the stability of phytate in soils or the limited presence or activity of specialised enzymes (phytase). Lower phytate concentrations suggest phytate maybe less stable in soils than previously supposed. Therefore, the rate of phytate degradation in a calcareous soil was investigated. Phytate was applied to a calcareous soil at four different concentrations (ranging from 58 – 730 mg kg⁻¹) and the effect of wheat straw as an additional source of carbon was also examined. Regardless of treatment, phytate concentrations decreased over the 13 -week incubation period and were adequately fitted to a first order decay model. There was no clear trend in the rate of phytate loss with treatment and the half life of phytate ranged from 4 to 8 weeks. The loss of phytate coincided with an increase in orthophosphate concentration, that in some cases more than doubled the native soil P concentrations, and there was very little variation in extraction efficiency. This result provided evidence for the microbial degradation of phytate. It demonstrated that in the calcareous soil examined, phytate was not highly stable, but a bioavailable source of organic P. The composition of soil P in 18 diverse Australian soils was also examined. Across all NaOH-EDTA soil extracts analysed, phytate comprised up to 9 %, but averaged only 3 % of total extractable P. Two other resonances that were also prominent in all the ³¹P NMR spectra and comprised a similar proportion of total organic P were due to α- and β-glycerophosphate. By examining the alkaline hydrolysis of a phospholipid (phosphatidlycholine), the potential source of α- and β-glycerophosphate was identified. Although α- and β-glycerophosphate and phyate gave rise to the most intense peaks, the broad signal, which was attributed to humic P, represented the most abundant form of soil organic P (27 – 72 % of total extractable organic P). Therefore, it was suggested that the development of methods that aim to increase the availability of stabilised forms of organic P should give preference to increasing the availability of P contained in humic P complexes. Understanding P cycling not only relies on analytical methods that enable the accurate identification and quantification of soil organic P but also requires methods that can gauge the susceptibility of different organic P species to enzymatic hydrolysis. Therefore, enzymatic hydrolysis was combined with ³¹P NMR spectroscopy to identify and compare the specific organic P species in the enzyme labile and non-enzyme labile fractions of a range of NaOH-EDTA soil extracts. Phosphorus- 31 NMR analysis of NaOH-EDTA soil extracts treated with active and inactivated phytase enzyme preparations showed that phytase hydrolysed the majority of the small, orthophosphate monoester compounds (α- and β-glycerophosphate, phytate, scyllo-inositol hexakisphosphate) and pyrophosphate, but orthophosphate diesters (DNA) and humic P were generally unaffected. The ³¹P NMR spectra revealed that not only was organic P hydrolysed but new orthophosphate monoester species were formed, possibly as a result of enzymatic phosphorylation. Although combining enzymatic hydrolysis and ³¹P NMR spectroscopy enabled the identification of individual organic P species that were susceptible or resistant to enzyme hydrolysis, there is still a need for further improvement and refinement of the technique in order to provide an accurate estimate of the potentially available fraction of soil organic P.
