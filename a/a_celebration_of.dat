5|$|The epistolary form unites The History of Sir Charles Grandison with Richardson's Pamela and Clarissa, but Richardson {{uses the}} form in a {{different}} way for his final work.

However, the dramatic mood is replaced in Grandison with <b>a</b> <b>celebration</b> <b>of</b> Grandison's moral character. In addition to this lack of dramatic emphasis, the letters of Grandison do not serve to develop character, as the moral core of each character is already complete at the outset.|$|E
