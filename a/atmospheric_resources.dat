40|$|This NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) Phase I study {{examined}} the revolutionary concept of performing resource collection and utilization during Mars orbital operations in order to enable the landing of large payloads. An exploration architecture was developed, out of which several mission alternatives were developed. Concepts of operations were then developed for each mission alternative, followed by concepts for spacecraft systems, which were traded to assess their feasibility. A novel architecture using Mars Molniya Orbit <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Resource</b> Mining is feasible to enable an Earth-independent and pioneering, permanent human presence on Mars by providing a reusable, single-stage-to-orbit transportation system. This will allow cargo and crew to be routinely delivered to and from Mars without transporting propellants from Earth. In Phase I, our study explored how electrical energy could be harnessed from the kinetic energy of the incoming spacecraft and then be used to produce the oxygen necessary for landing. This concept of operations is revolutionary in that its focus is on using in situ resources in complementary and varied forms: the upper atmosphere of Mars is used for aerocapture, which is followed by aerobraking, the kinetic energy of the spacecraft is transformed into usable electrical energy during aerobraking, and the atmospheric composition {{is the source of}} oxidizer for a landing under supersonic retropropulsion. This NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) Phase I study explores a novel mission architecture to establish routine, Earth-independent transfer of large mass payloads between Earth and the Mars surface and back to Mars orbit. The first stage of routine mission operations involves an <b>atmospheric</b> <b>resource</b> mining aerobraking campaign following aerocapture into a highly elliptical Mars orbit. During each pass through the atmosphere, the vehicle ingests the atmospheric oxidizer and stores it onboard, using solid oxide electrolysis to convert the primarily CO 2 atmosphere into usable O 2 for propellant. Power is made available through the use of magnetohydrodynamic energy generation, which converts the motion of the plasma in the shock later into usable electrical energy. Upon termination of the aerobraking sequence, the descent vehicle detaches from the orbit stack, deorbits, and executes the entry, descent, and landing sequence. Hypersonic deceleration is achieved via a deployable heat shield to lower the vehicle ballistic coefficient, and supersonic and subsonic deceleration are achieved via retropropulsion. Mars surface operations involve resource mining of the Martian regolith to produce CH 4 and O 2 propellant to be used for the subsequent MDAV ascent back to high Mars orbit (HMO) providing an apoapsis raise maneuver to initialize the aerobraking sequence, in addition to providing fuel from the Mars surface for EDL propulsive descent. The Resource Collector Vehicle (RCV), which is used for the orbital mining operations, is raised back to HMO via onboard deployable augmented solar electric propulsion.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper {{is to establish a}} comprehensive resource-based life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) method which is scientifically sound and that enables to assess all kinds of resources that are deprived from the natural ecosystem, all quantified on one single scale, free of weighting factors. The method is based on the exergy concept. Consistent exergy data on fossils, nuclear and metal ores, minerals, air, water, land occupation, and renewable energy sources were elaborated, with well defined system boundaries. Based on these data, the method quantifies the exergy "taken away" from natural ecosystems, and is thus called the cumulative exergy extraction from the natural environment (CEENE). The acquired data set was coupled with a state-of-the art life cycle inventory database, ecoinvent. In this way, the method is able to quantitatively distinguish eight categories of resources withdrawn from the natural environment: renewable resources, fossil fuels, nuclear energy, metal ores, minerals, water resources, land resources, and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>resources.</b> Third, the CEENE method is illustrated for a number of products that are available in ecoinvent, and results are compared with common resource oriented LCIA methods.

40|$|This book {{carries out}} {{approximate}} {{estimates of the}} costs of implementing ISRU on the Moon and Mars. It is found that no ISRU process on the Moon has much merit. ISRU on Mars can save a great deal of mass, but there is a significant cost in prospecting for resources and validating ISRU concepts. Mars ISRU might have merit, but not enough data are available to be certain. In addition, this book provides a detailed review of various ISRU technologies. This includes three approaches for Mars ISRU based on processing only the atmosphere: solid oxide electrolysis, reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS), and absorbing water vapor directly from the atmosphere. It is not clear that any of these technologies are viable although the RWGS seems to have the best chance. An approach for combining hydrogen with the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>resource</b> is chemically very viable, but hydrogen is needed on Mars. This can be approached by bringing hydrogen from Earth or obtaining water from near-surface water deposits in the soil. Bringing hydrogen from Earth is problematic, so mining the regolith to obtain water seems to {{be the only way to}} go. This will require a sizable campaign to locate and validate useable water resources. Technologies for lunar ISRU are also reviewed, even though none of them provide significant benefits to near-term lunar missions. These include oxygen from lunar regolith, solar wind volatiles from regolith, and extraction of polar ice from permanently shaded craters...|$|R

This activity has been applied on two locations: Jratun Seluna Watershed in Central Java and Saguling Watershed in West Java. On assessment of technology for lowering the intensity of rainfall, Calcium Oxide (CaO) {{was used as a}} seed material. To analyze whether this material affect negatively to thequality of rain fall and reservoir, a monitoring of the environment was conducted in target areas. This monitoring activity was intended to have an early diagnosis of any changes to qualities of rain fall or the reservoir water that might occur. The method used in this analysis was the comparative method that compares the result analysis of rain fall and reservoir water qualities with a maximum content value according to the PP No. 20 of 1990 for standard water quality type A. The analysis showed that the use of Ca O during modification activity gave no effect on qualities of rain fall and reservoir water because they were still under the maximum limit of standard quality type A, before, during and after the modification activity. In general, rainwater and reservoir water qualities, notably the pH parameter, for areas of Cemara and Banjaran during the activity were still below the maximum limit of standard water quality.

40|$|A multi-discipline team {{of experts}} from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) {{developed}} Mars surface power system point design solutions for two conceptual missions to Mars using In-situ resource utilization (ISRU). The primary goal {{of this study was}} to compare the relative merits of solar- versus fission-powered versions of each surface mission. First, the team compared three different solar-power options against a fission power system concept for a sub-scale, uncrewed demonstration mission. This pathfinder design utilized a 4. 5 meter diameter lander. Its primary mission would be to demonstrate Mars entry, descent, and landing techniques. Once on the Martian surface, the landers ISRU payload would demonstrate liquid oxygen propellant production from <b>atmospheric</b> <b>resources.</b> For the purpose of this exercise, location was assumed to be at the Martian equator. The three solar concepts considered included a system that only operated during daylight hours (at roughly half the daily propellant production rate of a round-the-clock fission design), a battery-augmented system that operated through the night (matching the fission concepts propellant production rate), and a system that operated only during daylight, but at a higher rate (again, matching the fission concepts propellant production rate). Including 30 % mass growth allowance, total payload masses for the three solar concepts ranged from 1, 128 to 2, 425 kg, versus the 2, 751 kg fission power scheme. However, solar power masses increase as landing sites are selected further from the equator, making landing site selection a key driver in the final power system decision. The team also noted that detailed reliability analysis should be performed on daytime-only solar power schemes to assess potential issues with frequent ISRU system on/off cycling...|$|E
40|$|Although {{our whole}} society {{depends on the}} use of natural resources, they are not always used in a {{sustainable}} way. To achieve a more sustainable development, resource consumption needs to be measured. Therefore, resource footprint frameworks are being developed. These frameworks integrate inventory methodologies, which quantify the specific resources consumed by a system, with resource accounting impact methodologies, addressing the environmental impact of resource consumption, e. g. the Ecological Footprint. To calculate the inventory of systems at micro-level (processes, products), process-models are generally used, as applied in process-based Life Cycle Analysis (LCA). For systems at meso- and macro-level (sectors, countries), economic input-output/IO-models are mostly used instead of process-models, as applied in IO-analysis and IO-based LCA. The objective of this paper is {{the development of a new}} resource footprint framework called IO-CEENE, in which a world IO-model (Exiobase), providing a global perspective, is integrated with the CEENE methodology (Cumulative Exergy Extraction from the Natural Environment), providing a more complete resource range. CEENE is an exergy-based method, thus it considers not only the resource quantity but also the extent to which consumption removes resource quality. Among the exergy-based methods, CEENE covers the largest number of resource groups: fossil fuels, nuclear resources, metals, minerals, land resources, water resources, abiotic renewable resources and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>resources.</b> This new framework allows one to calculate resource footprints of products or services consumed in different countries as the exergy extracted from nature.
