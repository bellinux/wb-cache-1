But the attribute character was only considered in these methods, and the proximity between spatial objects was ignored. The method proposed using melti-scale spatial cluster was based on the theory of scale space. The proximity and attribute characters were combined in this method. So the great interdependent spatial objects were merged, and the division results with different spatial scale were obtained. The multiscale spatial clustering method was used. County-based statistical data of per capita GDP from 1990 to 2004 was adopted as a case. The experiment shows the result {{is the same as the}} actual condition. The proposed method considered both of the spatial proximity and attribute similarity.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} Motion Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Model-Assisted Compatible (MA-STMAC) coding, a technique to selectively encode areas of different importance to the human eye in terms {{of space and time}} in moving images with the consideration of object motion. Previous STMAC was proposed {{based on the fact that}} human "eye contact" and "lip synchronization" are very important in person-to-person communication. Several areas including the eyes and lips need different types of quality, since different areas have different perceptual significance to human observers. The approach provides a better rate-distortion tradeoff than conventional image coding techniques based on MPEG- 1, MPEG- 2, H. 261, as well as H. 263. STMAC coding is applied on top of an encoder, taking full advantage of its core design. Model motion tracking in our previous STMAC approach was not automatic.

Seedling at fifth-leaf stage were transplanted {{at a rate of}} 16 hills m− 2 (spacing 25  cm[*]×[*] 25  cm) with one plant per hill. As a basal fertilizer, chemical fertilizer was applied at a rate of 5.0  g N, 12.0  g P and 12.0  g K m− 2 in form of ammonium sulfate, calcium superphosphate and potassium chloride, respectively. The plots were randomly arranged with three replicates. Plants were also grown outdoor in 8 -L pots filled with paddy soil (5.0  kg DW) and compound fertilizer containing 0.35  g N, 0.35  g P and 0.35  g K. Plant shoots were sampled at 28  days after transplanting in the field experiment and at heading stage in the pot experiment. Subsequently, the leaf area was measured by use of an <b>automatic</b> <b>area</b> meter (AAM- 8; Hayashi-denko, Tokyo, Japan), and then the samples were oven-dried at 80  °C for 3  days to determine dry weight. In addition, plant height, tiller number, leaf age, and SPAD value (SPAD- 502; Konica Minolta Sensing, Japan) were measured at the 28  days after transplanting in 2011. For evaluating grain phenotypes, grains of IR 24 and IL-hairy were photographed with digital camera and measured grain length and width by caliper.|$|E

40|$|<b>AUTOMATIC</b> STATISTICAL <b>AREA</b> DEFINITION IN ALGÉS PARISH. Portugal, {{along with}} many other countries, conducts a {{population}} census every 10 years. This way of counting the population offers a detailed photography of the country where many socio-economic variables are captured. In this study, it is assumed that census will be the way of population data collection and therefore the discussion deals with the issue of geographical aggregation of individuals and households enumerated. In this context, a methodological proposal for an <b>automatic</b> census <b>area</b> creation in the parish of Algés is described. The minimum geographic unit for completing the aggregations is the building since it was the smallest and stable unit for this purpose. The building layer was obtained in the municipal GIS of Oeiras and is based on large scale cartography (1 : 1000). Mainly, because the building layer is not contiguous, the study starts with the construction of a Thiessen polygon layer. This layer is drawn with the buildings layer centroids and having the master plan classes as barriers. The Thiessen polygon layer associated with the building attributes assumed a key role in this process and considering the range of possible data aggregation alternatives the zone boundaries are drawn concerning with some principles of consistence and homogeneity. To achieve a measurement of homogeneity for the statistical areas the variables used were the number of households, floors and type of building (residential, commercial, both). The <b>automatic</b> statistical <b>area</b> definition deals with the aggregation of the basic geographic units (Thiessen polygon layer), seeking for new optimized areas, considering the characteristics of the building and having a reference number of households around 100. To demonstrate the methodology used for the <b>automatic</b> statistical <b>area</b> definition, three simulation results are presented in this article...|$|R

Meanwhile, it is the major research subject in computer vision and accurate guidance. In this paper, a new characteristic quantity, i. e., the edge direction dispersion was defined.

Furthermore, the application of its characteristic in <b>automatic</b> suitable-matching <b>area</b> selection was studied. With a reasonable design for calculation precision, solving method for arctan(x) function in [-infin, +infin] could be simplified to linearization calculations in [0, 0. 25], then a fast algorithm for arctan(x) function was presented. Experimental {{results showed that the}} sub-image extracted by our fast algorithm had higher matching level and was suitable to be a matching template.
