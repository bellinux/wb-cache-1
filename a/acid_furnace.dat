40|$|Abstract—The {{presence}} of heavy metals {{in the environment}} could constitute a hazard to food security and public health. These can be accumulated in aquatic animals such as fish. Samples of four popular brands of canned fish in the Iranian market (yellowfin tuna, common Kilka, Kawakawa and longtail tuna) were analyzed for level of Cr after wet digestion with <b>acids</b> using graphite <b>furnace</b> atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The mean concentrations for Cr in the different brands were: 2. 57, 3. 24, 3. 16 and 1. 65 μg/g for brands A, B, C and D respectively. Significant differences were observed in the Cr levels between all of the different brands of canned fish evaluated in this study. The Cr concentrations for the varieties of canned fishes were generally within the FAO/WHO, U. S. FDA and U. S. EPA recommended limits for fish.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of actinides in animal tissue samples {{is very important}} for environmental monitoring. There is a need to measure actinide isotopes with very low detection limits in animal tissue samples, including fish, deer, hogs, beef and shellfish. A new, rapid actinide separation method has been developed and implemented that allows the measurement of plutonium, neptunium, uranium, americium, curium and strontium isotopes in large animal tissue samples (100 - 200 g) with high chemical recoveries and effective removal of matrix interferences. This method uses stacked TEVA Resin{reg_sign}, TRU Resin{reg_sign} and DGA-Resin{reg_sign} cartridges from Eichrom Technologies (Darien, IL, USA) that allows the rapid separation of plutonium (Pu), neptunium (Np), uranium (U), americium (Am), and curium (Cm) using a single multi-stage column combined with alpha spectrometry. Sr- 90 is collected on Sr Resin{reg_sign} from Eichrom Technologies (Darien, IL, USA). After <b>acid</b> digestion and <b>furnace</b> heating of the animal tissue samples, the actinides and Sr- 89 / 90 are separated using column extraction chromatography. This method {{has been shown to be}} effective over a wide range of animal tissue matrices. By using vacuum box cartridge technology with rapid flow rates, sample preparation time is minimized...|$|R
40|$|A {{direct method}} for the {{determination}} of arsenic in urine by Zeeman atomic absorption spectrometry has been proposed by graphite furnace atomization with (NH 4) (3) RhCl 6 + citric acid as a mixed matrix modifier. Different matrix modifiers including palladium, nickel and rhodium, {{were used for the}} elimination of phosphate interference, which was most troublesome in the arsenic determination in urine. Rhodium was preferred to palladium and nickel; in its presence {{the determination of}} arsenic in urine can tolerate a char temperature of 1600 degrees C, a temperature high enough to drive off the urine matrix including calcium phosphate without losing arsenic. The citric <b>acid</b> in the <b>furnace</b> evolved active gases and carbon upon decomposition thus facilitating the creation of a favorable reducing environment for the formation of a Rh-As alloy or intermetallic compounds which stabilized arsenic to a high temperature. In the determination of 1 ng of arsenic, 1. 0 mg ml(- 1) phosphate in the form of calcium phosphate can be tolerated. Analytical results obtained for standard urine sample compared (> 92 % recovery) well with the certified value. The lowest concentration of arsenic that could be determined was 20 ng ml(- 1) in the undiluted urine...|$|R
40|$|It was {{examined}} in this study that magnetic beads, which are assumed to be environmentally functional, could be effective in processing heavy metals that are water pollutants. For the purpose, magnetic beads containing carboxyl groups, which has strong binding force with heavy metals, are mixed with each Cd, Pb, Ni, Cu and Cr(III) solution, then stirred in pH 6. As a results of the process, it was proven that heavy metals bind quickly with magnetic beads through the reaction. In order to analyze heavy metal concentration, magnetic beads bind with heavy metal were collected by external magnetic force and dissolved in <b>acid.</b> The graphite <b>furnace</b> AAS was used to get heavy metal concentration melted in the acid solution. The results showed that heavy metal extractions by magnetic beads were influenced by the type and the concentration of a heavy metal, and over 90 % of a heavy metal can be extracted in ppm level save for Cr(III). It was also examined in the study whether heavy metal extraction is influenced when other ions exist in each heavy metal solution. According to experi-ment, adding other heavy metals to a solution did have little influence on extracting an intended heavy metal. But in case salt or heavy metal chelate was added, Ni extraction changed sensitively although extracting other heavy metals were influenced only when the concentration of an added substance is high. In conclusion, it was shown that magnetic beads could be used to treat wastewater with relatively high heavy metal concentration...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{presence}} of heavy metals {{in the environment}} could constitute a hazard to food security and public health. These can be accumulated in aquatic animals such as fish. Canned fish is consumed regularly in many countries. In this study, the levels of heavy metals Cu, Ni, Fe and Cr were evaluated in commercial canned fish products that are commonly consumed in Iran. The canned fish studied were longtail tuna, Kawakawa, Kilka and yellowfin tuna. Methods: Samples of four popular brands of canned fish in the Iranian market (yellowfin tuna, common Kilka, Kawakawa and longtail tuna) were analyzed for levels of Cu, Ni, Fe and Cr after wet digestion with <b>acids</b> using graphite <b>furnace</b> atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Results: The mean concentrations for the metals in the different brands were: For Cu: 0. 91, 0. 73, 1. 18 and 0. 84 μg g- 1 for brands A, B, C and D respectively. For Ni: 0. 37, 0. 19, 0. 14 and 0. 18 μg g- 1 for brands A, B, C and D respectively; For Fe: 45. 9, 34. 0, 77. 53 and 61. 3 μg g- 1 for brands A, B, C and D respectively. For Cr: 2. 57, 3. 24, 3. 16 and 1. 65 μg g- 1 for brands A, B, C and D respectively. Significant differences were observed in the heavy metal levels between all of the different brands of canned fish evaluated in this study. Conclusion: The metal concentrations for the varieties of canned fishes were generally within the FAO/WHO, U. S. FDA and U. S. EPA recommended limits for fish except for Iron for which all different Brands exceeded the limit. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{work within}} this thesis is {{directed}} towards optimising and expanding {{the application of}} electrodeposition-coupled-electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ED-ETAAS). The technique involves modifying {{the surface of the}} graphite furnace by in-situ electrodeposition of a noble metal. The analyte is electrodeposited onto the modifier and the spent sample matrix is aspirated from the furnace, thus separating the analyte from sample matrix components which can interfere with ETAAS analysis. The electrodeposited analyte is then determined by ETAAS. Parameters for electrodeposition of modifier and analytes were optimised. It was shown that ED-ETAAS could be used to determine lead, cadmium, and copper in 0. 5 M NaCl media with sensitivity and detection limits similar to conventional ETAAS. The technique was used to determine copper and cadmium in seawater. Different noble metal modifiers were compared. Palladium was shown to provide better sensitivity and thermal stabilisation than iridium or rhodium for lead determination. ED-ETAAS. was used for the determination of inorganic mercury. The detection limit for the technique, using a 20 µL sample volume, was ca. 18 ppb (corresponding to ca. 380 pg), with a characteristic mass of 91 pg. The electrodeposited palladium modifier provided greater analyte stabilisation and sensitivity than gold or ammonium sulphide modifiers. The technique was compared with cold vapour-ETAAS, for which a detection limit of ca. 1. 7 ppb was determined using an 8. 4 mL sample volume. The electrodeposited palladium modifier was shown to provide superior sensitivity to palladium chloride modifier. ED-ETAAS was examined as a technique for differentiating between free metal ions and those bound in inert and/or stable complexes. This involved selective deposition for fractionation of Bi 3 +, Pb 2 +, Ni 2 + and Cu 2 + in the presence of varying concentrations of EDTA. Fractionation of bismuth was possible (Bi-EDTA- is inert) but in labile systems the quantitative deposition process disturbed the solution equilibria resulting in an overestimation of the free metal concentration. In an attempted application to natural waters, problems were encountered with adsorption of fulvic <b>acid</b> on the <b>furnace</b> surface. Thus EDETAAS is not recommended as a method for fractionating metal-ligand species in natural systems. The ED-ETAAS technique was successfully used for fractionation of arsenic species. The detection limit for arsenite determination from nitric acid media was 0. 58 ppb (corresponding to 22 pg in a 39 µL sample), with a characteristic mass (peak absorbance) of 7. 5 pg. Total arsenic was determined from media containing L-cysteine, with a detection limit of 1. 3 ppb (51 pg) and a characteristic mass of 6. 6 pg. The technique was used to determine AsIII and total arsenic in two natural waters. The ED-ETAAS technique gave the same results as two comparative techniques (ETAAS and hydride generation ETAAS) provided that peak absorbance measurements were used...|$|R
