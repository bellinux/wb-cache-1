To date, no studies have prospectively examined changes in Stress-Sensitivity and Reward Experience following antidepressant treatment. The sample included 83 depressed patients and 22 healthy controls. A randomized controlled trial was carried out with patients receiving either imipramine or placebo for 6 weeks. At baseline and 6 weeks, patients and controls participated in an Experience Sampling procedure, prospectively measuring ecologically valid daily life <b>appraisals</b> of <b>activities</b> and mood states. The course of depression was assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Multilevel linear regression analyses showed that patients had higher negative and lower positive <b>appraisals</b> of <b>activities</b> than controls. In addition, patients showed increased Stress-Sensitivity (negative affect reactivity to negatively appraised activities). Treatment with imipramine decreased Stress-Sensitivity and increased Reward Experience (positive affect reactivity to positively appraised activities).

This paper examines {{the extent to which}} an ESA appears in UK policy <b>appraisal</b> <b>documents,</b> and how far implementing an ESA via appraisal may encounter the same difficulties. A clear understanding of this is vital for interrogating claims that improving knowledge necessarily leads to more sustainable ecosystem management. The paper reports on the content of seventy-five national-level policy appraisals undertaken in the United Kingdom between 2008 and 2012. Only some elements of an ESA appear, with even the environment ministry failing to systematically pick up the concept, which is indeed subject to many of the familiar barriers to embedding environmental knowledge in appraisals. Policy initiatives attempting to institutionalise ecosystem values need to be conversant with these barriers...|$|R

40|$|The study {{explored}} teacher {{performance appraisal}} {{and the potential}} benefits of appraisal as a mechanism for improving existing performance of teachers to collaboratively implement changes that lead to improve practice. The purpose of this Participatory Action Research (PAR) was to improve the existing documents and practices of teacher performance appraisal system and practices at a Community Based High School (CBS) in Karachi through collaboratively involving the principal and teachers in a systematic process of improvement. The research was qualitative in nature using PAR model as suggested by Kemmis and Mc Taggart (2000). This PAR model provided opportunities of constantly evaluating the teaching and learning strategies and their implementation in a real setting. The data of the study was collected through interviews, classroom-observations and feedback processes, assessments tools, field notes, reflection of research participants and document analysis to obtain empirical evidence of existing practices and perceptions. The findings were processed through data analysis by arranging data systematically and breaking it into units through coding, in order to meaning making of the data. The findings of research revealed that the awareness about the appraisal system and process is indispensable to improving the practices and understanding of the teachers. Moreover, it emerged from the findings that timely feedback, involvement, trainings and evaluation of set targets acted as cornerstones to improve the practice and process of the appraisal system. The findings reveal that the awareness training programmes regarding appraisal system enhance the knowledge and skills of teachers if the <b>appraisal</b> <b>documents</b> are understood by the teachers. Further research revealed that involvement of teachers in developing <b>appraisal</b> <b>documents</b> creates a sense of ownership, and this feature helps to improve the practices. The two purposes of appraisal, i. e. accountability and professional development, may not be segregated from each other at CBS; however, the focus of appraisal system shifted from accountability to professional development. This study holds significance for various audiences directly or indirectly, such as CBS where I carried out this research, and my own organization which I work for. The study could help in strengthening the appraisal system and process and it could also enable principals in further improving their appraisal system and practices. The recommendations that have come from this research are that school leadership should involve the teachers in making policies and procedures so that the teachers feel ownership of the appraisal system.

Such fore-casting, measurable in monetary terms, based on calculation of the economic rate of return or net present value, and including sensitivity analysis, is a sophisticated exer-cise. Note, whereas social analysis in an inte-grated CBA is critically important in identi-fying and quantifying the distributed amount of benefits and costs to the “win-ners ” and “losers ” of a reform project, it is beyond the requirements for a PAD and thus not explored further in this PREM Note.

[...] "...Tudor pier and breakwater have now yielded to a strong new sea-wall balanced by an arm {{on the opposite side of}} the cove, and we do not doubt that the fishermen sleep more soundly in their beds on stormy nights." [...] (Arthur Mee: Cornwall; The King's England; London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1937, p. 184.) The village centre dates from the 18th and 19th centuries, from a time when its prosperity was tied to local coastal freight and fishing. The port handled cargoes of coal, wood, stone, ores, limestone, salt, pottery and heavy goods which were conveyed along its narrow streets. Small coastal sailing vessels were built below Roscarrock Hill. The pilchard fishery began here before the 16th century and in 1850 there were 49 registered fishing boats and four fish cellars. Fishermen still work from the Platt, landing their catches of fish, crab and lobsters. The historic core of the village was designated a Conservation Area in 1971 and North Cornwall District Council reviewed this in 2008 with the endorsement of detailed Port Isaac Conservation Area <b>Appraisal</b> <b>document</b> and a related Conservation Area Management Plan.

40|$|This PhD {{examines}} {{the practices of}} clothing product development, particularly in connection with retail buying, and their implications with regard to sustainability. These are two fundamental dimensions of the clothing sector, yet they have not received adequate attention in the literature. My research redresses this gap in three key ways. Firstly, there tends to be an assumption {{in much of the}} literature that the US system of retail buying is applicable universally. However, my research revealed that own-label buying processes in the UK clothing sector operate differently to those referred to in US texts. Secondly, my research found that other roles that work alongside buying and design teams are significant in clothing product development (e. g. merchandisers, textile designers and technologists), although this has been under-reported or omitted in previous studies. Thirdly, sustainability is a prominent issue which is affecting product development in the clothing sector increasingly, ultimately impacting upon consumer behaviour in terms of selection, purchase, maintenance and disposal of garments, yet it was virtually absent from existing studies. The overall aims of this critical <b>appraisal</b> <b>document</b> are to introduce the two key strands of my research into clothing product development practices and their implications for sustainability, to locate my research within existing studies, and to outline the impact of my publications for my field of research.
