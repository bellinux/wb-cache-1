5000|$|One way a {{woman could}} get out of Yoshiwara was for a rich man to buy her {{contract}} from the brothel and keep her as his personal wife or concubine. Another would be if she managed to be successful enough {{that she was able to}} buy her own freedom. This did not occur very often, though. Many women died of sexually transmitted diseases or from failed abortions before completing their contracts. A significant number served out their contracts and married a client, went into other employments (including other forms of prostitution), or returned to their family homes. In these cases, the <b>advanced</b> <b>payments</b> their parents <b>received</b> could be used to fund her dowry. (There was no stigma against marrying a former prostitute.) ...|$|R

2500|$|Taking {{two years}} to write, Caine’s novel The Christian was {{published}} by Heinemann in 1897. It is the first novel in Britain to have sold over a million copies [...] The book was inspired by Rossetti’s verses Mary Magdalene At The Door Of Simon The Pharisee, written for his painting, depicting a man trying to pluck back a woman {{about to enter the}} gates of heaven. Caine followed it with a lecture tour of Scotland, a one-man dramatic performance of his novelette Home Sweet Home. The Christian was serialised in Britain in the Windsor Magazine between December 1896 and November 1897 and in the United States in Munsey's Magazine between November 1896 and January 1898. [...] Mainly set in Victorian London, {{it is the story of}} Glory Quayle, a young woman living an independent life who becomes an actress, and John Storm, who enters the priesthood. It was the first time that Caine had taken up the Woman Question. The character of John Storm is drawn from a composite of the Hon. and Rev. [...] James Adderley, an Anglican priest of Berkley Chapel, Mayfair, London, and Father Stanton, who became an Anglican bishop. [...] Caine dramatised the book in 1896. His play was so popular with the public that the Daily Mail published it in a thick-paper, illustrated edition. He directed the play, travelling to New York where he went on to deliver a series of lectures and readings there. Viola Allen produced the play for the first time on the stage at Albany, New York on 25 September 1898. It opened at the Knickerbocker Theatre on 10 October 1898, running for twenty-one weeks in New York. Almost one thousand clergymen attended a matinee on 15 November 1898. George C. Tyler, reportedly made one million dollars from the Broadway production of The Christian. On his return to London after being on tour, Wilson Barratt gave Caine half of an <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> <b>received</b> from an Australian manager for Barratt’s stage adaptation of The Christian. Caine rejected both the money and the play. Barratt unsuccessfully sued Caine on the grounds that they had an agreement to collaborate on the dramatisation. The Christian was first produced in England at the Duke of York's Theatre in October 1899. It failed after two months. Caine authorised a touring production with his sister Lily playing Glory Quayle and managed by her husband George Day which in 1907 was still continuously performed by up to three companies. After Finnish politician and writer Aino Malmberg sought aid from Caine on her country’s behalf, he offered the Finnish rights to the Finnish National Theatre. Finland belonged to the Russian Empire and was actively seeking Independence. Malmberg translated Caine's works into Finnish.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} was conducted to evaluate the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> methods in the construction sector. Data were collected from different contractors, consultants & clients to analyses the contractor's financing state {{and the effect of}} the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> methods on the contractor's finance. Interviews and the documentary research are the two methods adopted for the data collection. From the data analysed during this research {{it is clear that the}} almost of all contractors are facing to cash flow problems during the projects. The existing <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> practice of providing 20 % advance at the beginning of the project is not sufficient to overcome these cash flow problems. Therefore improvement in the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> system is urgently required for the development of the construction sector in Sri Lanka. The main conclusions of the research were that a better <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> proposal couldn't be generalize. The three advance payment" proposals considered in the research were: A. Providing <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> of 20 % at the beginning. B. 20 % advance at the beginning and another 10 % advance at the middle third of the project; and C. Providing 20 % advance & the material advances for the main construction materials. The suitable <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> proposal has a greater bearing on the variable factors for the contractors finance. These variable factors and their effect on each of these <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> proposals are analysed and presented. By observing in to the data analysed it's clear that the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> system for each and every contract, must be decided by considering limitations of the contractors finance. Presently the client & the consultant decide the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> method. But this system has to be modified, as the contractor will be able to request for his preferred <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> option. By looking in to the other possible alternatives available for the contractors,(for to find the finance); going for his preferred <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> system is profitable for the contractor even after allowing of a discount to the client. Therefore the existing <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> system can be used to improve the contractors finance without increasing the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> percentage. However allowing the selection of the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> option to the contractor may create an another difficulty in evaluation of the contracts at the tendering stage. If the request for discount percentages, for each and every <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> option &their modifications (Delayed <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> recovery or reduced payback period) are included in the tender document the evaluation of the tender can be done under the grounds of equity...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{determine}} that how far is the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> needed to ensure the smooth running of construction works. A questionnaire survey was used {{to carry out the}} study. The questionnaire consists of 10 factors that bring to the needs of <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> in smoothing the construction works. The level of importance factors was measured and the relative importance of weights was ranked. The scope of study is limited to contractor firms, developer companies and consultants firms in the Penang Island, Butterworth (main land) and Taiping, Perak are located. The study found that, to prevent the delay of works is the main factor and to speed up the progress of works is the second most important factor by providing the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> in construction projects. The results were analyzed to rank the need of <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> to ensure the smoothing of construction works.

Generally, the full amount of an <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> for services is taxable income to the recipient in the year received. This is true even if the services extend beyond the taxable year. However, a loan is not gross income to the recipient.

The title was later changed to Maasi and the film's launch was held on 1 April 2009 at a private club in the {{presence}} of the members of the cast and crew. The film's audio launch was held on 26 May 2010 with actor Karthi and Hansraj Saxena of Sun Pictures releasing the disk in a grand scale function. At a press conference, Kicha announced that two of his police films Bhavani IPS and Maasi would see back to back releases in July 2010, though the deadline passed without further news. The film was set to release in late August 2011 alongside Arjun's other film Mankatha, but ran into a legal tussle with the makers of Idhudhanda Police — 2. The team of that film claimed they bought the remake rights of the Hindi film, Risk and based their Idhudhanda Police — 2 on it. They appealed that Maasi had copied almost 75 per cent of the scenes from the Hindi film that they were remaking and obtained an order in Hyderabad City Civil Court to stay the release of the film, and subsequently caused a delay. The film was further delayed in early 2012, when the director was arrested for failing to return an <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> he had <b>received</b> from another producer, hence Tamil Kumaran sought a stay on the film.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} determination {{as to whether}} the Mobilization <b>Advance</b> <b>Payment</b> is actually necessary in the Sri Lankan construction industry, its effect on contractors' cash flow and whether it is a motivation for the contractors. Accurate cash flow forecasting is essential to all contractors in the construction Industry for successful operation and existence in the long run. At initial stages of a project the cash flow aspect of the contractor is negative. The main role of project financing is to cover up this negative flow in a beneficial, cost effective manner. Mobilization <b>Advance</b> <b>Payment</b> enhances the quality and productivity in the construction industry. It improves the performance and cost efficiency of the contractors as well as the clients. Cash data in relation to thirty projects were collected. Three criteria, no Mobilization Advance, 20 % of the initial contract sum as the Mobilization Advance paid at the inception of the project and 20 % of the initial contract sum as Mobilization Advance given in stages, were identified to determine the differences in the effects of cash flow. The effect of these different criteria on the cumulative cash flow was examined. Further Scheduled Performance Index was calculated for further analysis. Results show and confirm that Mobilization <b>Advance</b> <b>Payment</b> has a big bearing on the contractors' existence and their motivation towards attaining objectives of the project. Research confirms that Mobilization <b>Advance</b> <b>Payment</b> is a necessity in the Sri Lankan construction industry. Further it can be confirmed that the provision of Mobilization <b>Advance</b> <b>Payment</b> is very essential for the Sri Lankan contractors.
