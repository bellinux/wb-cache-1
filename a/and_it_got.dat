5|$|Although entries of meteoroids into Earth's {{atmosphere}} {{are very}} common, recording a similar flight through the upper {{layers of the}} atmosphere is quite rare. Probably the first one reliably verified happened on 20 July 1860 above the American state of New York. The Czechoslovak–Polish fireball is sometimes compared to the 1972Great Daylight Fireball above Utah, the United States, and Alberta, Canada, {{which is the first}} scientifically observed and studied event of this type. The 1972 fireball was more than a thousand times as massive <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>got</b> 40km closer to Earth's surface. Observational data from both of them helped to develop a method for computing the grazing trajectories of such bodies, which was later used when calculating the trajectory of another Earth-grazing meteoroid, observed on 29 March 2006 above Japan.|$|E

500|$|She {{began work}} on her first novel, An Ordinary Lunacy, {{relatively}} late in life: she started writing in her late thirties, and it was published only in 1963, by which time she was aged 47. Although it began life as a radio play, Anderson quickly found that An Ordinary Lunacy was [...] "interesting enough for a novel, so I went off, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>got</b> quite out of hand." [...] The novel detailed the romance between thirty-five-year-old Sydney barrister, David Byfield, and Isobel Purdy, a woman accused of murdering her husband. Acclaimed for its adept portrayal of the protean nature of romantic love, An Ordinary Lunacy foregrounds the different perspectives of three women: Isobel, Daisy Byfield (David's mother), and Myra Magaskill, David's ex-lover. Pam Gilbert writes that [...] "Anderson's construction of the tensions existing between three women such as Daisy, Isobel and Myra offers an interesting platform for an exposition of romance and passion from a woman's perspective." ...|$|E
500|$|Yankovic was {{inspired}} to write the song after he heard The Kinks' song [...] "Lola" [...] while driving in his car one day. He noted, [...] "I was driving a rent-a-car through Florida when the song 'Lola' came on the radio, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>got</b> me thinking about how much fun I had doing 'Yoda' [...] where I took a then-current topic and combined it with a classic rock tune." [...] He soon {{turned his attention to}} the film Jurassic Park—about a park on a fictional island, where geneticists have succeeded in cloning dinosaurs. The film is based on the 1990 novel of the same name by Michael Crichton—which had just come out and was already a blockbuster success. Yankovic decided to write a parody about the movie, and considered various songs that he could spoof. Eventually, he decided to parody the 1968 hit single [...] "MacArthur Park", which was performed by Richard Harris. Yankovic approached the original song's writer, Jimmy Webb, who agreed to the idea. In fact, Webb was so amused by the parody that he later penned a letter to Yankovic that read, [...] "Well, [...] oughta [...] bury that song once and for all!" [...] In addition, Yankovic received permission from Crichton and director Steven Spielberg to produce the track.|$|E

500|$|When the {{character}} was announced, he {{was described as}} a hustler who sees everything as an opportunity, and has created several personas since the age of seven to hide his real self. Norwood expanded on this, saying [...] "when he was in school and the register was being read out <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>got</b> to his name it would be 'Chubb!' and all the kids in school would start taking the mickey out of it. What he did was create something even more ridiculous to take away from that. He [...] out of himself and took the power away from those that were taking the mickey out of him. [...] For the same reason most kids put on a front, it's to protect himself from the world. He doesn't like his real name so he tried to create something that would get away from that and Fatboy was that creation. The street and the slang stuff is not something that is far away from him, it is still from the area that he lives in. Fatboy was someone he adopted to put a brave face on, to put a mask on himself, to protect Arthur from the world." [...] Before adopting the [...] "Fatboy" [...] persona, he would adopt personas of men he saw on television, and Norwood said Fatboy was [...] "an awkward kind of child". Fatboy comes from a wealthy background, and gets what he wants from his parents, with whom he has a good relationship, but hustles to hide the fact. He often wears clothing brand Ed Hardy, and his speech has, according to Norwood, a [...] "unique rhythm". Norwood is able to make viable changes to the script to make it sound more authentic.|$|E
500|$|Madonna herself {{would later}} say: [...] "I wouldn't say I regret it. I've made {{mistakes}} and learned from them. Most {{people want to}} hear me say that I regret publishing my Sex book. I don't. What was the problem was releasing my Erotica album at the same time. I love that album <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>got</b> overlooked." [...] However, author Andy Koopmans in his book Madonna (2002) would comment that the singer regretted both publishing Sex and recording Erotica and that the book [...] "had affected everything she did later". It was not until 2003 that Madonna would once again declare that she regretted nothing; [...] "I'm not apologizing in any shape or form [...] I was interested in pushing buttons and being rebellious and being mischievous and trying to bend the rules. There was a lot of irony in the Sex book and I am poking fun at a lot of things and I am being kind of silly and adolescent and I am being very f you, if a man can do it, I can do it." [...] A year earlier on 2002, Naomi Campbell confessed to [...] "have {{a lot of respect for}} Madonna being bold enough to come out and do a book on sex. I've never reneged on that". However, in 2009, rapper Vanilla Ice, who was Madonna's boyfriend at the time of the book's creation, confessed to not being happy with the book once he saw it. [...] "My friends were like, 'Dude, that's cool man', but I was like, 'I'm dating her, it's not cool to see your girlfriend with all these other people' [...] It kinda ruined the whole thing. I wonder what her kids think of that book? Here she is writing kids' books now but they're going to see it and go, 'Mommy, what were you thinking?'" [...] Another of the book's models, actress Isabella Rossellini, told Out magazine that she regretted her participation on the book; [...] "I don't think the book worked, even though the photos were extraordinary, and some of them quite memorable. I think there was a little bit of a moralistic sort of 'I'll teach you how to be free!' – and that bothered the hell out of me." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{early as}} 1960, 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenue was {{described}} by The New York Times as [...] "the 'worst' [...] in town".

During his hearing he was asked by Judge Lieutenant Colonel Kwasi Hawks [...] "Were you going to shoot at (civilians) to scare them <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>got</b> out of hand?". Morlock replied: [...] "The plan was to kill people, sir". Morlock challenged his guilty plea, but the Army Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction and sentence.|$|E

There was worse news for England cricket fans as Ashley Giles was unable to field because of a strained hip flexor muscle. Giles said, [...] "It's a shame because it's been going really well.
