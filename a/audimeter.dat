50|$|The {{audience}} {{measurement of}} U.S. television {{has relied on}} sampling to obtain estimated audience sizes in which advertisers determine the value of such acquisitions. According to The Television Will Be Revolutionized, Amanda D. Lotz states that during the 1960s and 1970s, Nielsen introduced the Storage Instantaneous <b>Audimeter,</b> a device that daily sent viewing information to the company's computers using phone lines and made national daily ratings available by 1973. Although the audimeters did not supply sufficient information regarding demographics of the audience, it did however allow Nielsen to establish diary reports that presented some insight on the audience. According to Lotz, the Nielsen sample included approximately 1,700 <b>audimeter</b> homes and a rotating panel of approximately 850 diary respondents. Nielsen was the controlling factor of audience measurement for national network television.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, Kennedy's {{assassination}} dissolved {{differences among}} {{many people as}} they were brought together in one common theme: shock and sorrow after the assassination. It was seen in statements by the former presidents and members of Congress, etc. The news was so shocking and hit with such impact; according to the Nielsen <b>Audimeter</b> Service, within 40 minutes of the first reporting of the assassination, the television audience doubled, by early evening, 70% were at their television sets.|$|E
5000|$|In 1936, Arthur C. Nielsen {{acquired}} the <b>Audimeter,</b> which measured which radio stations a radio had been tuned to during the day. After {{tinkering with the}} device for a few years, the company created a national radio rating service in 1942. The company collected information on which stations were tuned to in 1,000 homes. Then, this survey data was sold to manufacturers {{who were interested in}} the popularity of programs and demographic information about listeners for advertising purposes. This was the birth of audience measurement that would become the most well-known part of Nielsen’s business when applied to television. Today, these are commonly referred to as [...] "Nielsen ratings".|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of the digital terrestrial television (DTT) around the world brings new problems to the television audience measurement process. In a multisignal context, {{with the emergence of}} new contents and squarely in front of the contemporary technological convergence, the correct representation of the viewing behaviors faces methodological challenges. New methodologies (Audio or Video Matching, Water Marketing) are needed in order to measure the digital television audiences.The measurement using <b>audimeters</b> enters a new era, facing the dual challenge of analog and digital measurement in a mixed television broadcast.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{tell the story of}} the smallgroup of people who, in France, have been in charge of the {{measurement}} and theappreciation of the audience of television, and had to invent audience research,to organize it and to communicate its results to "clients" whodepended on it much earlier than usually assumed: television managers andprofessionals, public authorities, and, last but not least, advertisers. The paper will explore both change andcontinuity. First, change: the professional origin and training of measurerschanged much over the years. In the early days, they could have an almostliterary profile. The first person in charge of the audience at the RadioTélévision Française was a teacher of philosophy. His followers had a formationin sociology and semiology. They all insisted on the fact that they were not"simply" measurers, and also worried about appreciation, quality,culture. They always figures did produce figures, but rarely only about thenumber of people present in front of the screen, mostly about satisfaction,appreciation, preferences for given genres, viewing habits. As there was onlyone channel – until 1964, with the number of TV sets rising sharply, ratings,in the modern sense, were not critical. Things started to change gradually. In 1974,the public broadcasting corporation was divided into several companies,including three competing channels. The service in charge of measuring audiencewas put under the direct authority of the Prime Minister. Audience figuresplayed a part in the distribution of resources, not only advertising but throughthe license fee sharing. However, the law also provided a clause about an indexof quality, which never functioned satisfactorily, although the service incharge of audiences put much effort into it. In 1985, around the time of deregulation,change came. From outside, this was translated into the rise of daily,detailed, fast produced figures of the audience through <b>audimeters,</b> thenpeoplemeters. Those figures become highly controversial; a popular book on TVwore the title: "The dictatorship of the audimat". But audiencemeasurers did not turn into dictators. They were, undoubteldy, more consideredas technicians. Their competence in statistics became crucial. But they werealso negotiatiors, consensus builders who have to work in an atmosphere ofgrowing suspicion as the revenues of television depended now mainly, if not only,on audience figures. However, continuity was there aswell. The need for effective mediations of the audience existed from the start. Those mediators, figures, reports, played several roles. Particularly, and thisis true until two days, they provided channels managers with a source of“para-democratic legitimacy”. For the “profession” of measurers, this meansthat they have always played an important roles, as spokespersons of theaudience, equipped with an almost magical kind of knowledge: the power to“read” the will and whims of a mysterious, anonymous mass of viewers...|$|R
50|$|In 1929, {{while still}} {{a student at}} Columbia, Robinson filed for Patent #1961170, an {{invention}} for recording the tuning of individual radio sets for what he imagined would be a ratings industry. This invention would record what a radio was tuned to, when it was turned on, {{and the length of}} time turned on. Further, the object of the invention would provide for scientifically measuring broadcast listener response over a selected period of time. Robinson sold his patent to RCA. Eventually, A.C. Nielsen developed the <b>AudiMeter,</b> or PeopleMeter, on which the Nielsen rating system was founded. The A.C. Nielsen Company continues to measure and compile statistics on television audiences and their viewing habits.|$|E
5000|$|The Nielsen sample {{included}} roughly 1,700 <b>audimeter</b> homes and rotating board of nearly 850 diary respondents, {{by the early}} 1980s. Nielsen launched its Nielsen Homevideo Index (NHI) in 1980 to measure cable, pay cable, and VCRs, and the NHI began offering daily cable ratings in 1982. Nielsen’s continued to advance with steady changes into the mid 2000s (decade). Along with changing their counting methods, Nielsen also started emphasizing their sample in 2003 in reaction to census shifts and requests from some industry sectors. Nielsen’s automated Local People Meter (LPM) technology was introduced in New York and Los Angeles. The LPM improved the method of measurement from active and diary-based to passive and meter-monitored. More importantly, the LPM provides accurate measurements to particular local markets, verse a nationwide sample from the People meter. While diary-based surveys concentrated on quarterly sweeps periods, the industry has been pushed toward year-round measurement, due to the automated LPM system.|$|E

As {{a result of}} the study several protective measures were taken: (1) employees exposed to noise hazards were required to wear ear-protection devices, (2) mufflers and air diversion devices were installed around the wind tunnels; and (3) all personnel that are required to wear ear protection are given annual <b>audimeter</b> tests...|$|E
40|$|International {{audience}}Using an actor–network theory approach, {{this article}} {{argues that the}} audience exists only from the moment it is circumstantiated and instantiated. To observe the audience, sociology thus needs to identify its practices, discourses and manifestations. This hypothesis is illustrated through a historical case study: {{the adoption of a}} new television audience measurement, the peoplemeter (a new <b>audimeter</b> machine nowadays widely used by professionals) in France in the late 1980 s. It opens the technology’s black box at a time when changes forced actors to reconsider their collective and individual audience definitions. Through analysing the implementation of the peoplemeter, this article shows how a triple process of routine, consensus and trust led the actors to accept this new system. This process, it is argued, explains how actors translated a state of their own construction of the audience into a technological system...|$|E
40|$|The ways {{of knowing}} modern audiences, {{broadcast}} ratings, is now big billion dollar business, with Google in alliance with Nielsen, {{one of the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s leading media researchers, to literally auction audiences off to the highest bidder. Ironically, 2 ̆ 7 the black box 2 ̆ 7 of survey and sampling methodology that delivers audiences remains a mystery to most, just as Art Nielsen 2 ̆ 7 s original 2 ̆ 7 black box 2 ̆ 7, the <b>Audimeter,</b> for measuring radio sets baffled onlookers. The black box, though, is in crisis. It is beset by a rapidly changing media and consumer environment, heightened demand for ever more precise information, increasing measurement difficulty and declining respondent participation. Sampling has also become the subject of political and methodological battles of how to represent people, including everything from the Census to the Internet. Recent US research on non-response shows that technology rich households are rejecting participation in audience surveys. The joint Arbitron and Nielsen Project Apollo, designed to collect everything about audience behaviour also found the people were rejecting both the intrusion into their private lives and the tasks given to them. In this paper the authors outline the contemporary survey and sampling wars in modern audience ratings, including especially the proliferation of different ways of measuring audiences and audience rejection of many of them...|$|E
