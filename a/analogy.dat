5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, Ian Ramsey {{developed}} {{the theory of}} <b>analogy,</b> a development later cited in numerous works by Alister McGrath. He argued that various models of God are provided in religious writings that interact with each other: a range of analogies for salvation {{and the nature of}} God. Ramsey proposed that the models used modify and qualify each other, defining the limits of other analogies. As a result, no one <b>analogy</b> on its own is sufficient, but the combination of every <b>analogy</b> presented in Scripture gives a full and consistent depiction of God. The use of other analogies may then be used to determine if any one model of God is abused or improperly applied.|$|E

In this study, descriptive method was used. 4 th, 5 th, and 8 th classes Science and Technology course books; 7 th, 8 th classes Science Books were used as a source. <b>Analogies</b> in the course books were classified according to the literature and the problems found related to the <b>analogies</b> are pointed out in the study. In this study it was seen that eighty-nine <b>analogies</b> were used in Science and Technology and in Science course books.

5|$|Qiyas or analogical {{reason is}} the fourth source of the sharia for the {{majority}} of Sunni jurisprudence. It aims to draw analogies to a previously accepted decision. Shiites do not accept <b>analogy,</b> but replace it with reason (aql); among Sunnis, the Hanbalites have traditionally been reluctant to accept <b>analogy</b> while the Zahirites don't accept it at all. Analogical reason in Islam is the process of legal deduction according to which the jurist, confronted with an unprecedented case, bases his or her argument on the logic used in the Qur'an and Sunnah. Legally sound <b>analogy</b> must not be based on arbitrary judgment, but rather be firmly rooted in the primary sources.|$|E
5|$|The scheme {{presented}} in the table {{is known as the}} impedance <b>analogy.</b> Circuit diagrams produced using this <b>analogy</b> match the electrical impedance of the mechanical system seen by the electrical circuit, making it intuitive from an electrical engineering standpoint. There is also the mobility <b>analogy,</b> in which force corresponds to current and velocity corresponds to voltage. This has equally valid results but requires using the reciprocals of the electrical counterparts listed above. Hence, M → C, S → 1/L, D → G where G is electrical conductance, the inverse of resistance. Equivalent circuits produced by this scheme are similar, but are the dual impedance forms whereby series elements become parallel, capacitors become inductors, and so on. Circuit diagrams using the mobility <b>analogy</b> more closely match the mechanical arrangement of the circuit, making it more intuitive from a mechanical engineering standpoint. In addition to their application to electromechanical systems, these analogies are widely used to aid analysis in acoustics.|$|E

40|$|Although <b>analogies</b> are {{commonly}} used in Science textbooks, studies on textbooks used in undergraduate courses are unusual. Taking this into account, this paper presents an analysis on the <b>analogies</b> found in General Chemistry textbooks, aiming to establish a parallel with studies whose focus was on high school textbooks. After reading the textbooks, 212 <b>analogies</b> were identified. They were classified according {{to a system of}} categories adapted from studies present at the literature. Undergraduates' textbooks presented more <b>analogies</b> than high school textbooks, differences in analogical relation and a minor presence of illustrative <b>analogies.</b> This work also discusses directions for an adequate use of some <b>analogies,</b> as well as aspects related to the teacher ́s role...|$|R

5|$|On the average, {{space is}} {{observed}} {{to be very}} nearly flat (close to zero curvature), meaning that Euclidean geometry is empirically true with high accuracy {{throughout most of the}} Universe. Spacetime also appears to have a simply connected topology, in <b>analogy</b> with a sphere, at least on the length-scale of the observable Universe. However, present observations cannot exclude the possibilities that the Universe has more dimensions and that its spacetime may have a multiply connected global topology, in <b>analogy</b> with the cylindrical or toroidal topologies of two-dimensional spaces.|$|E
5|$|Professor Nathan Katz {{writes of}} the <b>analogy</b> of a burning building, {{used by the}} Buddha in the Lotus Sutra, which casts {{religious}} language as imperative.

40|$|Despite the {{postulated}} {{importance of}} analogising to human cognition, {{the study of}} analogical problem solving in the laboratory has found disappointing results. Providing an analogue to a participant prior to asking them {{to solve a problem}} gives only a small benefit at best. Recently, studies outside the laboratory have suggested that experts frequently use <b>analogies</b> in realworld situations. It is less clear whether novices can also spontaneously invoke and use <b>analogies</b> to solve realistic problems. In the current investigation, undergraduates were observed solving a large-scale management problem over two weeks. It was found that many <b>analogies</b> were produced (on average 4. 6 per one-hour session), and that 77 % of these <b>analogies</b> reflected a structural rather than a superficial mapping between a base and a target. It was also determined that 56 % of these structural <b>analogies</b> involved non-trivial mappings of higher-order relations. Further, it was found that <b>analogies</b> were drawn to serve two different purposes: problem solving and illustration. In generating illustrative <b>analogies,</b> participants frequently made superficial mappings, but when generating <b>analogies</b> to solve problems, they never made purely superficial mappings...|$|R

This study reports the results of an analysis of the use of <b>analogies</b> in eight biochemistry textbooks, which included textbooks written for one-semester survey biochemistry courses for non-majors; two-semester courses for chemistry or biochemistry majors; and biochemistry courses for medical school students.

40|$|This cross age {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate how students make predictions in novel situations and the role which self generated <b>analogies</b> play in non-scientific reasoning. Mixed methods were used combining group discussions with questionnaires. One age-group from each level of the Greek education system were recruited. Thirteen, sixteen and twelve students participated from Year 4 (primary education), Year 9 (secondary education, Greek ‘Gimnasium’) and Year 11 (secondary education, Greek ‘Lyceum’) respectively from three different schools in Greece. Nine focus group discussions were conducted in combination with the administration of a six pictorial item questionnaire. Students’ responses were analysed to ascertain whether their predictions drew on the use of <b>analogies.</b> Also, responses were analysed to see if students of different ages drew on the same <b>analogies</b> when made predictions in the same novel situations. It emerged that there were many similarities among students’ predictions as well as the <b>analogies</b> they used to explain the latter. For the explanations students provided for the predictions they made a total of 21 <b>analogies</b> were identified. The findings indicate that connecting <b>analogies</b> to novel situations was important in the construction of predictions. The children in Years 4 and 9 made the same predictions using similar, and in many cases identical <b>analogies</b> in their predictions. Whilst students in Year 11 made the same predictions and did make use of those same, similar, <b>analogies</b> the frequency with which they drew on <b>analogies</b> to make predictions appeared much less than for the two younger groups. This study found that students regularly make use of <b>analogies,</b> rather than scientific thinking. Results also indicated that the <b>analogies</b> students use derived from phenomena they observe at a very young age. Teachers {{need to be aware of}} the nature of <b>analogies</b> students make use of in order to help them use the <b>analogies</b> correctly and in accordance with concepts they are taught facilitating the way they make sense of abstract scientific knowledge...|$|R
