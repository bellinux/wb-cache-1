5|$|In June 1913, the Entwurf ("draft") {{theory was}} the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more {{difficult}} than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. <b>After</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in November 1915.|$|E

5|$|To {{compensate}} {{for the lack of}} capital, foreign investment—in particular from Great Britain—was courted, but it was not sizable enough to initiate an economic recovery.

Ultimately Spanish America could only connect to the world markets as an exporter of raw materials and a consumer of finished products.|$|E

5|$|In October 1777, <b>after</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> {{years in}} Congress, President Hancock {{requested}} {{a leave of}} absence. He asked George Washington to arrange a military escort for his return to Boston.

By this time Hancock had become estranged from Samuel Adams, who disapproved of what he viewed as Hancock's vanity and extravagance, which Adams believed were inappropriate in a republican leader. When Congress voted to thank Hancock for his service, Adams and the other Massachusetts delegates voted against the resolution, as did a few delegates from other states.|$|E

5|$|Faced {{with the}} choice of {{remaining}} with Clarkson, whose plans were nullified by SDCC's decision, or cooperating with the council, Maguire chose the former and with Mulden's financing, initiated a High Court judicial review of the decision. The review failed and on 11 April 2005, facing debts of over two million Euro, the club entered into examinership. The 400 Club agreed to completely bankroll the club during the process. On 5 May 2005, Tony Maguire resigned on request by the FAI, who had discovered that the club had submitted their 2003 accounts in their {{application for a licence}} for the 2005 season. This resulted in a points deduction and subsequent relegation under Roddy Collins. The examinership concluded in July 2005 with the examiner accepting the 400 Club's bid for Shamrock Rovers, saving the club from extinction, and the supporters-owned club won promotion at the first attempt in 2006 under Pat Scully. The 2007 and 2008 seasons at Tolka Park were ones of overachievement and stability, but the major event of the period was the recommencement of building on the stadium <b>after</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> years of legal disputes between the council and Thomas Davis CLG.|$|E
5|$|A belt route around Salt Lake City {{was first}} {{proposed}} in 1955, with the Utah Highway Department (the predecessor to the present-day Utah Department of Transportation) holding hearings concerning construction beginning in early 1958. The southeast quadrant {{of the route}} was originally placed from a junction at proposed I-15 in Murray northeasterly through Murray and Holladay, eventually reaching the east bench at 3900 South. From there, it would have run north toward the mouth of Parley's Canyon at proposed I-80 (at the time US-40). Almost immediately, this plan was met with opposition among local residents in the area. The proposed route would have bisected the primarily residential Holladay suburb, {{as well as the}} southern portion of Murray. <b>After</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>two</b> years of hearings and widespread opposition from residents, the Highway Department released their proposed routing in June 1960, which placed the southeast quadrant where it runs today. While quelling criticism from some, others remained in opposition, saying the route was still too intrusive along residential areas. The western quadrant was also admonished for being placed to close to other major arterials. In November 1963, a small, two-lane portion of the northwest quadrant of the belt route opened from Redwood Road (SR-68) in Davis County west and south to 2100 North, north of the Salt Lake City International Airport. This portion of road was extended east to I-15 in North Salt Lake and upgraded to freeway standards by 1969.|$|E
