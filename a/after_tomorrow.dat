50|$|On August 19, 1934, {{barely a}} month <b>after</b> <b>Tomorrow’s</b> Children was released, Adolf Hitler, a known {{eugenics}} lobbyist, became the recognized sole-leader of Germany. As Hitler began his conquest through Germany, the sterilization of the bloodlines {{of different races}} and religions of people occurred. Hitler’s ideals revolved around humanity becoming its purest by removing the parts he deemed unworthy. Although Hitler began his eugenic practices in 1936, Foy and Wilbur were able to relate the same message through the sterilization of Diane Sinclair's family in the film. Possible references to Hitler's regime in the film include a flag bearing what looks like the Nazi symbol in the background during a conversation between the two doctors. Foy Productions appealed its denied license in 1938 while the Nazi Aryan movement was still gaining power, thus resulting in the film's extremely unfit theme.|$|R

5|$|An Inconvenient Truth is a 2006 American {{documentary}} film directed by Davis Guggenheim about former United States Vice President Al Gore's campaign to educate citizens {{about global warming}} via a comprehensive slide show that, by his own estimate made in the film, he has given {{more than a thousand}} times. The idea to document his efforts came from producer Laurie David, who saw his presentation at a town-hall meeting on global warming, which coincided with the opening of The Day <b>After</b> <b>Tomorrow.</b> Laurie David was so inspired by Gore's slide show that she, with producer Lawrence Bender, met with Guggenheim to adapt the presentation into a film.|$|E

5|$|Day 3 outlooks {{refer to}} the day <b>after</b> <b>tomorrow,</b> and include the same {{products}} (categorical outline, text description, and probability graph) as the Day 2 outlook. As of June 2012, the SPC forecasts general thunderstorm risk areas. Higher probability forecasts are less and less likely as the forecast period increases due to lessening forecast ability farther in advance. Day 3 moderate risks are quite rare; these have been issued only fourteen times since the product became operational (most recently for May 9, 2015). Day 3 high risks are never issued and the operational standards do not allow for such. This is most likely because it would require both a very high degree of certainty (60%) for an event which was still at least 48 hours away and a reasonable level of confidence that said severe thunderstorm outbreak would include significant severe weather (EF2+ tornadoes, hurricane-force winds, and/or egg-sized hail).|$|E
5|$|The {{opening scene}} is a three-minute computer-generated sequence, {{beginning}} {{with a view of}} Earth from high in the exosphere and listening in on numerous radio waves of modern programming emitting from the planet. The camera then starts zooming backward, passing the Moon, Mars, and other features of the solar system, then to the Oort cloud, interstellar space, the Local Bubble, the Milky Way, other galaxies of the Local Group, and eventually into deep space. As this occurs, the radio signals start to drop out and reflect older programming, representing the distance these signals would have traveled at the speed of light, eventually becoming silent as the distance becomes much greater. The sequence eventually resolves into the iris of young Ellie's eye as she is listening on her amateur radio set. This scale view shot of the entire universe was inspired by the short documentary film Powers of Ten (1977). At the time, it was the longest continuous computer-generated effect for a live-action film, eventually surpassed by the opening sequence from The Day <b>After</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> (2004).|$|E

50|$|The {{song was}} written by Hikaru Utada, and is the first Christmas song she has written. The song is a piano backed slow paced ballad, sung in a higher {{register}} {{to the majority of}} Utada's songs. Other than piano, subtle background sounds are occasionally added into the instrument backing, such as occasional cymbal sounds. The lyrics describe a person in winter on Christmas Eve, who cannot wait for Christmas Day, however, asks why people want to chase <b>after</b> <b>tomorrows</b> instead of cherishing what they have now. The protagonist of the song has days filled with nothing to do at Christmas time, and feels that she wants to be close to her lover. She chides her lover for trying to act cool in front of her, but feels the distance between them growing less. She wants her lover to not promise her things for the future, and instead to listen to what she feels right in that moment.|$|R
