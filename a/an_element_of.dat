5|$|Groups are {{frequently}} studied through group representations. In their most general form, these {{consist of a}} choice of group, a set, and an action of the group on the set, that is, an operation which takes <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the group and <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the set and returns <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the set. Most often, the set is a vector space, and the group represents symmetries of the vector space. For example, there is a group which represents the rigid rotations of space. This {{is a type of}} symmetry of space, because space itself does not change when it is rotated even though the positions of objects in it do. Noether used these sorts of symmetries in her work on invariants in physics.|$|E
5|$|A {{powerful}} way {{of studying}} rings is through their modules. A module {{consists of a}} choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the ring and called the underlying set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and an operation which takes <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the ring and <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the module and returns <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the module. The underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal {{the structure of the}} ring in ways that are not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring is a field.|$|E

Nonetheless, the Place de la Bastille continued to be the traditional location for left wing rallies, particularly in the 1930s, the symbol of the Bastille was widely evoked by the French Resistance during the Second World War and until the 1950s Bastille Day remained the single most significant French national holiday.|$|E
5|$|During his youth, Lutosławski studied {{piano and}} {{composition}} in Warsaw. His early works {{were influenced by}} Polish folk music. His style demonstrates {{a wide range of}} rich atmospheric textures. He began developing his own characteristic composition techniques in the late 1950s. His music from this period onwards incorporates his own methods of building harmonies from small groups of musical intervals. It also uses aleatoric processes, in which the rhythmic coordination of parts is subject to <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> chance.|$|E
