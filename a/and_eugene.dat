While the brothers free Fetch <b>and</b> <b>Eugene,</b> Augustine encases Reggie's feet in concrete and blasts them off the platform. As they dangle above the ocean, Reggie realizes that Delsin cannot save both of them, tells him that he is proud of him, and lets Delsin's hand go and falls to his death.

5|$|Shortly {{after its}} peak, the {{hurricane}} began {{to interact with}} land. The hurricane weakened to a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale later that day. At 1200UTC on July25, Eugene made landfall near Manzanillo with winds of 90mph (145km/h), making Hurricane Eugene the only tropical system to move ashore during the season, though one hurricane and one tropical storm came close to land in September and October respectively. Because of the topography of Mexico, the storm weakened rapidly, <b>and</b> <b>Eugene</b> was downgraded to a tropical storm six hours after landfall. After briefly moving inland, Eugene emerged into the southern Gulf of California. However, re-intensification did not occur; instead, Eugene continued weakening due to its close proximity to land. The weakening system was downgraded to a tropical depression early on July26, <b>and</b> <b>Eugene</b> dissipated at 1200UTC that day.|$|E
