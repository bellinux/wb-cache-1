25|$|A {{number of}} legal {{scholars}} {{who support the}} outcome of the ruling nonetheless criticize the Supreme Court's approach to Beck's First Amendment challenge.

25|$|The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari on May 31, 1987. In a {{surprising}} move, the U.S. Department of Justice supported CWA's appeal. The Solicitor General at the time, Charles Fried, {{argued that the}} voluntary nature of collective bargaining agreements (including <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> clauses) made the issue of coercion moot. Because states could and did ban <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> agreements, there was no governmental action {{on which to base}} a constitutional claim against the union. And because Section 8(a)3 plainly requires uniform dues and fees (e.g., unions could not charge <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers more nor less than regular members), the Justice Department felt Beck's claim was justified. Upset by the Justice Department's stand, Republican Senators Jesse Helms, Dan Quayle, Steve Symms, and Strom Thurmond filed an amicus curiae brief urging the Supreme Court to rule in Beck's favor.|$|E

25|$|Harry Beck was a {{maintenance}} worker with the Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co. (C) in Maryland and a CWA organizer. Beck protested {{the use of}} his union dues for a political cause in which he did not believe and asked for a refund. The CWA refused, arguing that using union dues for political expenditures was appropriate and legal. In the early 1970s, after disagreeing with national CWA officials over a union organizing drive in suburban Baltimore, Maryland, Beck resigned from the union and began to pay the $10-a-month <b>agency</b> <b>fee.</b> Beck continued to protest {{the use of his}} <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> for political purposes, and asked the CWA to provide a more accurate accounting of how much money it spent on politics. The union refused. In June 1976, Beck and 19 other non-union members of the CWA's bargaining unit at C sued the union for a refund. The National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation provided legal counsel and support to Beck and the other 18 workers. Beck quit C in 1979 and moved to Oregon, where he worked at CWA-organized job at American Telephone & Telegraph and continued to pay his <b>agency</b> <b>fee.</b>|$|E
25|$|U.S. District Court Judge James R. Miller, Jr. {{ruled in}} favor of Beck and the 19 other co-plaintiffs in March 1983.

Hanson. Applying the clear and convincing evidence standard, the district court found that CWA could not show that 21 percent of the <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> was spent on collective bargaining purposes alone, ordered an immediate refund of all dues collected since January 1976, and directed CWA to establish a record-keeping system which segregated collective bargaining and non-collective bargaining accounts. The refund was about $5,000 for all 20 workers.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{these many}} rulings, the Supreme Court had never {{extended}} its <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> rulings to unions {{covered by the}} National Labor Relations Act and many lower courts were confused as {{to the state of}} the law. In 1986, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against non-union workers in a case very similar to Beck involving the United Auto Workers.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, the NLRB {{decided on}} the {{preferred}} remedy that should be imposed where a union failed to inform employees of their Beck rights. In Rochester Manufacturing Co., 323 NLRB 260 (1997), the Board ordered that the union return {{to the status quo}} ante, give all workers their Beck rights notice, give each all workers the opportunity to submit <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> calculation objections for every dues collection period at issue, and the reimburse each objecting employee.|$|E
25|$|Seventh, some {{scholars}} {{point out that}} the Beck ruling may lead to unanticipated outcomes. At least one commentary on Beck concludes that Beck rights, if successfully implemented, may lead large numbers of workers to resign from a union during a strike. These workers will be able to continue to work during a strike (incurring none of the disadvantages a strike brings), and yet will still be able to enjoy the benefits of collective bargaining (assuming the strike is successful and an agreement is negotiated). The strike is the most powerful weapon unions have, and undermining the union's ability to strike would put labor unions at a distinct disadvantage in collective bargaining. The NLRB and Supreme Court have acknowledged the role that <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers can play in undermining strikes. In NLRB v. Textile Workers Union, 409 U.S. 213 (1972), the Supreme Court ruled that once a union member had resigned, the union could not punish that worker for crossing picket lines. And in Pattern Makers' League v. NLRB, (as noted above) the Court said unions must permit members to resign at any time. Decisions like these have informed the NLRB's rulings on the issue as well. The Board found that an employer did not commit an unfair labor practice when it distributed notices to employees prior to a strike that outlined an employee's rights during a strike (including the right to become an <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payer and cross picket lines). The Board also held that, once a single employee has inquired about their right to become an <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payer, it is legal for an employer to notify all workers about this right. But {{in the absence of an}} employee-initiated iniquiry, it is not, the Board says, legal for employers to approach striking workers and ask them to become <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers. The negative implications of widespread worker resignation from unions prior to or during a strike is clear, some argue. This may be changing, however, as more unions turn away from strikes and toward comprehensive campaigns. It is also unclear how Beck may impact dues checkoff (an agreement between the employer, union, and employee under which the employer agrees to deduct union dues directly from the employee's paycheck and turn it over to the union). In 1991, the NLRB held that dues checkoff agreements create an obligation to pay dues in the same way that becoming a union member does. It is possible that Beck and subsequent rulings could also undermine dues checkoff agreements.|$|E

5000|$|The National Labor Relations Act, as amended, allows {{unions to}} require that {{non-union}} members pay <b>agency</b> <b>fees</b> to cover collective bargaining costs and prevent free rider problems.

In Railway Employes' Dept. v. Hanson, 351 U.S. 225 (1956). the Court held that the agency shop provisions of the Railway Labor Act were constitutional, but withheld judgment as to [...] "the validity or enforceability of a union or closed shop agreement if other conditions of union membership are imposed or if the exaction of dues, initiation fees or assessments is used as a cover for forcing ideological conformity or other action in contravention of the First or the Fifth Amendment." [...] Five years later, in Machinists v.

25|$|The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) {{struggled}} {{to implement the}} Court's holding in Beck. In 1989, the National Right to Work Committee polled NLRB offices nationwide, posing as workers and asking about the requirement to pay union dues. The group found that Board agents and other staff at 22 of 29 offices gave the wrong information. Although the NLRB initially dismissed the report, {{within a few weeks}} the agency admitted its errors and ordered all its regional offices to review recent developments in labor law and provide accurate information on <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> rights.|$|E
25|$|Prospects for {{addition}} {{initiatives and}} legislation {{at the federal}} and state level appear mixed as of 2009. Former Federal Election Commission Chair Bradley A. Smith (who opposes compulsory unionism) has argued that even the most stringent laws are unlikely to have any impact, as the number of <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers is small compared to the number of union members. At least one legal scholar has questioned the constitutionality of paycheck protection laws, while another, detailed analysis of the Washington state effort has concluded that instead of decreasing the amount of union dues available for political expenditures paycheck protection actually increased it (from approximately $630,000 to approximately $780,000) as unions shifted member dues internally to account for the agency fees going toward collective bargaining.|$|E
2500|$|The {{issue of}} <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> {{payments}} {{was a national}} and serious one. [...] By 1984, about 5 percent of employees at work sites covered by a union contract had opted not to join the union and instead pay an <b>agency</b> <b>fee.</b> In 1987, {{the same number of}} workers covered by CWA contracts were <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers. At the time of the Beck case in 1987, a majority of unions had set the <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> about equal to full union dues. More than 90 percent of all collective bargaining agreements (covering six million workers) made under the authority of the NLRA contained an <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> provision.|$|E

5000|$|Right-to-work proponents, {{including}} the Center for Union Facts, contend that political contributions made by unions are {{not representative of}} the union workers. The agency shop portion of this had previously been contested with support of National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation in Communications Workers of America v.

2500|$|Similarly, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) had had {{occasion}} since 1945 {{to address the}} union shop and <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> issues. Among its key cases was In re Union Starch & Refining Co., 87 NLRB 779, (1949). [...] The Board held in Union Starch that unions were permitted to charge nonmembers agency fees that were nearly equal to full union dues so long as these agency fees were uniform in nature and no additional requirements were made in violation of NLRA Section 8(a)(3)(B) or §8(b)(2). A second important case, Teamsters Local No. 959, 167 NLRB 1042 (1967), the Board concluded that special assessments or fees could {{not be part of}} the <b>agency</b> <b>fee.</b> Reacting to the Supreme Court's ruling in Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, the Board held in Detroit Mailers Union No. 40, 192 NLRB 951 (1971) that certain fraternal activities may be included in the <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> so long as they are not special assessments. The Board also ruled repeatedly {{on a number of issues}} associated with agency fees. It held in several cases that the NLRA does not permit the collection of assessments through the <b>agency</b> <b>fee.</b> The RLA, in contrast, does. The Board also held that when determining what an assessment is, facts (not labels) matter most.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the years}} {{just before the}} Supreme Court took up the Beck case, however, it {{elaborated}} on its previous <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> rulings. [...] In Ellis v. Railway Clerks, 466 U.S. 435 (1984), the Supreme Court concluded that the <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> may only cover those activities {{directly related to the}} union's role as a collective bargaining representative. [...] These included national conventions (where dues levels were set and union programs debated and established), social activities (which enhanced union solidarity, especially during negotiations), grievance handling, contract negotiation costs, and union communications, but excluded union organizing activities. The Court in Ellis also wrestled with the issue of rebates, and concluded that a union could not simply rebate agency fees to workers for that would essentially constitute a forced, interest-free loan from the worker to the union. In 1985, the Court held in Pattern Makers v. NLRB, 473 U.S. 95 (1985), that a union member may resign at any time without notice. Thus, Pattern Makers further undermined the union shop by giving workers the right to resign from the union at any time and incur no penalty (such as termination of employment). [...] The Court also crafted additional rules regarding agency fees in Teachers v. Hudson, 475 U.S. 292 (1986). In Teachers, the union had failed to minimize the risk that agency fees might be used for impermissible purposes and had failed to provide <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers with adequate information about how the <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> was calculated. Now the Supreme Court imposed a third requirement, that <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers must be offered a timely, fair, and objective mechanism for challenging the computation of agency fees. The Court did uphold, however, the use of interest-bearing escrow accounts for holding disputed dues.|$|E
2500|$|Brennan next {{turned to}} the workers' first two claims. [...] The {{majority}} noted that NLRA Section 8(a)(3) contains two provisions which clearly permit <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> agreements. For the majority, [...] "The statutory question presented in this case, then, is whether this 'financial core' includes the obligation to support union activities beyond those germane to collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment. We think it does not." [...] The majority reviewed the Court's previous decision in Machinists v. Street and found it controlling. The majority further concluded that Section 8(a)(3) and Section 2, Eleventh of the Railway Labor Act were statutorily equivalent. The majority reviewed at length the legislative history of both the Railway Labor Act and the National Labor Relations Act to provide support for this conclusion, and to show why in each case Congress had approved of <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> agreements. Relying on the Court's analysis of the Railway Labor Act in Street, the Supreme Court said CWA was not justified in concluding that Section 8(a)(3) permits the collection of agency fees {{in excess of the}} amount necessary to cover the costs of collective bargaining. The majority further found that the legislative history of the NLRA, the Taft-Hartley Act, and the Railway LAbor Act (RLA) showed that Congress intended to restrict <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> agreements to cover collective bargaining alone and no other purposes.|$|E
25|$|Sixth, {{critics have}} argued that the Beck Court misapplied its duty of fair {{representation}} doctrine. One legal commentator has concluded that the Supreme Court's duty of fair representation decisions do not lead to the conclusion that <b>agency</b> <b>fees</b> can be restricted solely to collective bargaining purposes.

2500|$|Disputes {{over the}} {{constitutional}} and statutory status of union shop and agency shop agreements began {{almost immediately after}} the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act. In the Supreme Court's first major ruling on the issue in Railway Employes' Dept. v. Hanson, 351 U.S. 225 (1956), the Court held that the union security provisions of the Railway Labor Act were constitutional, but withheld judgment as to [...] "the validity or enforceability of a union or closed shop agreement if other conditions of union membership are imposed or if the exaction of dues, initiation fees or assessments is used as a cover for forcing ideological conformity or other action in contravention of the First or the Fifth Amendment." [...] The ruling in Hanson appeared to call into serious question the viability of union shop agreements. Five years later, in Machinists v. Street, 367 U.S. 740 (1961), the Court held that the Railway Labor Act [...] "denies the authority to a union, over the employee's objection, to spend his money for political causes which he opposes." [...] The high court also confronted the issue of remedy in Machinists v. Street, and outlined several options which unions and employers might adopt as well as rejecting remedies which the district court in the case had chosen. [...] The Supreme Court returned to the union security issue three more times in 1963. [...] In NLRB v. General Motors Corp., 373 U.S. 734 (1963), the Court held that agency fees equal to dues are not prohibited by the National Labor Relations Act. Nonetheless, in Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 373 U.S. 746 (1963), the Court questioned whether an <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> set at a level equal to member dues was unfair because it set collective bargaining fees higher for non-members than for members. After reargument, however, the Court in Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 375 U.S. 96 (1963), did not reach the issue again and instead decided the case on narrow procedural grounds (concluding that Florida's right-to-work law outlawed the union shop provision at issue). The Court further elaborated on the issue of remedies in Railway Clerks v. Allen, 373 U.S. 113 (1963), allowing <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> payers to opt out of all political expenditures rather than enunciate specific examples but refusing to allow them to act as a class. The Supreme Court extended its constitutional and equity analysis to public employees in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, 431 U.S. 209 (1977), holding that, where public employee collective bargaining exists and <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> clauses are clearly authorized by law, public employee <b>agency</b> <b>fee</b> mechanisms are also constitutional.|$|E
