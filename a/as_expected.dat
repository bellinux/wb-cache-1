5|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} {{have very}} large aspect ratio, i.e., their length {{is much larger}} than their diameter. Consequently, <b>as</b> <b>expected</b> from the classical electromagnetic theory, elastic light scattering (or Rayleigh scattering) by straight CNTs has anisotropic angular dependence, and from its spectrum, the band gaps of individual nanotubes can be deduced.|$|E
5|$|Each team progressed {{through five}} rounds {{to reach the}} final. Both teams {{were members of the}} Football League First Division, Bolton Wanderers occupying a {{position}} in upper-mid-table and Manchester City next to bottom. Consequently, Bolton entered the match as favourites and, <b>as</b> <b>expected,</b> went on to win, their single goal being scored by David Jack.|$|E

But proof after proof was furnished, and the finally the world had to believe.|$|R
5|$|The Government {{amended the}} bill to delay debate for six months. <b>As</b> <b>expected,</b> the bill then fell when the Dáil was {{dissolved}} in the intervening period for the 2007 general election. Deputy Howlin said that {{the real reason for}} the delay was that the Government did not want to enact this type of social legislation {{in the face of an}} election.|$|E
5|$|The flyby {{spacecraft}} performed {{one of two}} divert maneuvers {{to avoid}} damage. A 14-minute burn was executed which slowed down the spacecraft. It was also reported that the communication link between the flyby and the impactor was functioning <b>as</b> <b>expected.</b> The impactor spacecraft executed three correction maneuvers {{in the final two}} hours before impact.|$|E
5|$|This {{incident}} {{along with}} the next continental US tests in 1951 set a precedent. In subsequent atmospheric nuclear tests at the Nevada test site, United States Atomic Energy Commission officials gave the photographic industry maps and forecasts of potential contamination, as well <b>as</b> <b>expected</b> fallout distributions, which enabled them to purchase uncontaminated materials and take other protective measures.|$|E

5|$|Wheelwright's {{position}} at the church in Hampton had, <b>as</b> <b>expected,</b> been filled during his absence, but he was quickly called by residents of the neighboring town of Salisbury to be their pastor, and on 9 December 1662, when 70 years old, he was installed there. This became Wheelwright's longest pastorate in his varied life, lasting nearly 17 years.|$|E
5|$|After Gasketball 2012 release, Boxleiter and Wohlwend {{planned a}} celebratory road {{trip to a}} game jam in Victoria, British Columbia. The game did not fare <b>as</b> <b>expected,</b> so Boxleiter used the two-day jam to create the core mirror {{reflection}} mechanics of what would become TouchTone, though it would take two years of sporadic work to finalize {{the remainder of the}} game. In TouchTone, the player monitors phone calls as part of a government surveillance program to find public threats. The story is told through a series of reflection puzzles wherein the player swipes the screen to reflect a beam around a room to its intended destination.|$|E

He added that Mahesh and Kajal participated in the film's shoot for 65 and 30 days respectively.|$|E

5|$|Although all {{elements}} up to oganesson have been discovered, {{of the elements}} above hassium (element 108), only copernicium (element 112), nihonium (element 113), and flerovium (element 114) have known chemical properties, and only for the copernicium is there enough evidence for a conclusive categorisation at present. The other elements may behave differently from what would be predicted by extrapolation, due to relativistic effects; for example, flerovium has been predicted to possibly exhibit some noble-gas-like properties, {{even though it is}} currently placed in the carbon group. More recent experiments have suggested, however, that flerovium behaves chemically like lead, <b>as</b> <b>expected</b> from its periodic table position.|$|E
5|$|Antón, <b>as</b> <b>expected,</b> {{was named}} as the squad {{leader for the}} Vuelta a España. His goal was overall success. He was joined in the squad by fellow Giro d'Italia stage winner Nieve, Martínez, Verdugo, Txurruka, Oroz, Isasi, Azanza and Cazaux. Nieve commented a day into the Vuelta that he would ride solely to support Antón, {{despite the fact that}} both had won Giro stages and he (Nieve) had {{actually}} finished the race higher overall.|$|E
5|$|Arizona won {{the game}} 49–48 after scoring two touchdowns {{in the final two}} minutes to come back for the victory. <b>As</b> <b>expected,</b> the game was {{dominated}} by offense; Arizona and Nevada combined for 1234 total yards and 70 first downs. Despite losing the game, Nevada possessed the ball nearly twice as long and gained twice as many rushing yards as Arizona. Arizona quarterback Matt Scott was named the game's offensive most valuable player (MVP), and teammate Marquis Flowers, a linebacker, was named the game's defensive MVP.|$|E

5|$|<b>As</b> <b>expected</b> by Voltaire, Candide {{has enjoyed}} both great success and great scandal. Immediately after its secretive publication, {{the book was}} widely banned because it {{contained}} religious blasphemy, political sedition and intellectual hostility hidden under a thin veil of naïveté. However, with its sharp wit and insightful portrayal of the human condition, the novel has since inspired many later authors and artists to mimic and adapt it. Today, Candide is recognized as Voltaire's magnum opus and is often listed {{as part of the}} Western canon; it is among the most frequently taught works of French literature. The British poet and literary critic Martin Seymour-Smith listed Candide as one of the 100 most influential books ever written.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>expected,</b> Chapman {{was named}} as captain for the Australian tour. The MCC touring team was {{regarded}} as a strong one by commentators; the only controversy was the omission of Frank Woolley which was not fully explained. Rumours in later years said that Chapman was responsible for leaving Woolley out as he was jealous of his county team-mate, but Lemmon regards this as unlikely.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{the first}} stage of the Australian take over, Brigadier Raymond Sandover's 6th Brigade was {{directed}} to secure the Jacquinot Bay area. While the region was believed to be undefended, the initial landing was conducted by a combat-ready force comprising the reinforced Australian 14th/32nd Battalion protected by warships and with aircraft on standby. <b>As</b> <b>expected,</b> there was no opposition to the landing on 4 November and work soon began on logistics facilities.|$|E

He proposed to keep reserves of wheat to help have control over its price. He also tried to make leather recognised {{as a product of}} the country, in order to promote its commercial potential. None of these proposals were accepted. He designed a system to give prizes to achievements that would boost the local economy, diversify the agriculture, or deforest the pampas. The system did not work <b>as</b> <b>expected,</b> and as nobody met the requirements no such prize was ever given.|$|E
5|$|Bernoulli {{wrote the}} text between 1684 and 1689, {{including}} {{the work of}} mathematicians such as Christiaan Huygens, Gerolamo Cardano, Pierre de Fermat, and Blaise Pascal. He incorporated fundamental combinatorial topics such as his theory of permutations and combinations (the aforementioned problems from the twelvefold way) {{as well as those}} more distantly connected to the burgeoning subject: the derivation and properties of the eponymous Bernoulli numbers, for instance. Core topics from probability, such <b>as</b> <b>expected</b> value, were also a significant portion of this important work.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{investigates the}} murder of a {{motorcycle}} dispatch-rider and the theft of his top-secret documents by a motorcycle-riding assassin. The rider was en route from SHAPE, the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, then located in Versailles, to his base, Station F, in Saint-Germain in France. Since Bond is already in Paris, his superior, M, sends him to assist in the investigation in any way he can. Bond disguises himself as a dispatch-rider and follows the same journey to Station F as the previous rider: <b>as</b> <b>expected,</b> the assassin attempts to kill Bond. Bond, however, is ready and kills the assassin. He then uncovers the assassin's hidden base of operations.|$|E
