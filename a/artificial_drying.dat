40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{determining}} the maximum cost level of <b>artificial</b> <b>drying</b> required for cost-efficient operation. This was done using a system analysis approach, in which the harvesting potential and procurement cost of alternative fuel chip production systems were compared at the stand and regional level. The accumulation and procurement cost of chipped delimbed stems from young forests were estimated within a 100 km transport distance from a hypothetical end use facility located in northern Finland. Logging and transportation costs, stumpage prices, tied up capital, dry matter losses and moisture content of harvested timber were considered in the study. Moisture content of artificially dried fuel chips made of fresh timber (55 %) was set to 20 %, 30 % and 40 % in the comparisons. Moisture content of fuel chips based on natural drying during storing was 40 %. Transporting costs were calculated according to new higher permissible dimensions and weight limits for truck-trailers. The procurement cost calculations indicated that with <b>artificial</b> <b>drying</b> and by avoiding dry material losses of timber, it could be possible to reduce current costs of the prevailing procurement system based on natural drying of timber at roadside landings. The maximum cost level of <b>artificial</b> <b>drying</b> ranged between 1. 2 – 3. 2 € MWh– 1 depending on the supply chain, moisture content and procurement volume of fuel chips.

Seed vigor testing was carried out in the laboratory, using Completely Randomized Design, while Randomized Complete Block Design was applied to field experiment for testing seedling vigor. The treatment consisted of two factors as followed:(I) Levels of seed maturity: MI = 27 daf (days after flowering), M 2 = 30 daf, M 3 = 33 daf, M 4 = 36 daf, and M 5 = 39 daf (2) Conservation methods: K 1 = pods were spread out in the processing unit room for about 1 week, the seed moisture content was dropped to 40 %; K 2 = sun drying; K 3 = <b>artificial</b> <b>drying,</b> using seed dryer 400 C.

The drying methods were: <b>artificial</b> <b>drying</b> with hot air, <b>artificial</b> <b>drying</b> with fresh air, natural yard drying, natural shade drying and natural field drying. The water content of seeds was monitored before, during and after drying.

The experimental design was randomized and the averages compared by the t-test at 5 % significance. Results showed that artificial hot air drying favored with higher germination and vigor of crambe seeds when compared to other drying methods and demanded shorter time to reduce the water content.

40|$|A {{series of}} nitrogen-doped carbon/Ketjenblack (KB) {{composites}} is synthesized by pyrolyzing nitrogen-containing ionic liquid (IL) on KB. The obtained composites {{have a significant}} effect on the morphology of Li 2 O 2 in nonaqueous Li-air batteries. As the surface catalytic layer, the nitrogen-doped carbon significantly enhances the discharge capacity to > 9905 mAh g(- 1) in <b>artificial</b> <b>dry</b> air, comparable to the performance of air-cathodes with precious metal catalysts under pure oxygen environment. This increase in the accommodating capacity of Li 2 O 2 could be attributed to the high utilization ratio of air-cathode's porosity, resulting from the domination of solvent pathway during the growth of Li 2 O 2, which is probably preferred around the pyridinic-N sites of the nitrogen-doped carbon layer. The results of this study demonstrate that the proposed carbonaceous materials could produce high-energy-density Li-air batteries without the use of precious metal catalysts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Nanoscale {{observation}} of beetle's attachment systems has revealed various exquisite multiscale architectures for essential {{functions such as}} wing fixation, crawling, mating, and protection from predators. Some of these adhesion systems are mediated by liquid secretion (capillary force), whereas some are purely operated by direct interlocking of high-density microfibers or contact of mushroom-like hairy structures (van der Waals force). In this review, we present an overview of recent advances in beetle-inspired, <b>artificial</b> <b>dry</b> and wet adhesives {{in the context of}} nanofabrication and material properties. For convenience, the beetle's adhesions from wing to tiptoe are classified into four types: hair interlocking, mushroom-shaped pads, oil-assisted spatula-shaped pads, and claws. After introducing the structural features and functions of these systems, we describe how the current nanofabrication methods can be applied to mimic or exploit the systems. Furthermore, relevant beetle-inspired structural materials, devices (fastener, medical tape, electric connector, etc.) and microrobots are briefly overviewed, which would shed light on future smart, directional and reversible adhesion systems. close...|$|R
