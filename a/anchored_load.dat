40|$|By {{virtue of}} certain design features, bone {{anchored}} metal implants {{can be made}} to elicit a strong initial osteogenic response, i. e., the amount of bone formed. While quantitative differences are often lost at longer follow up times, do differences in the initial osteogenic response lead to long-term alterations in bone quality? This thesis investigates osseointegration in terms of bone quality, with an emphasis on the osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network (Ot. LCN) in relation to compositional and ultrastructural patterns observed at intermediate or late healing. A series of investigations was undertaken to study osteocyte lacunae on the forming bone surface (Paper I), hypermineralised lacunae of apoptotic osteocytes (Paper II), autogenous bone fragments found within healing sites (Paper III), bone formed adjacent to surface modified implants (Papers IV–VI), and bone formed within macroporous implants (Papers VII and VIII) using a range of analytical microscopy and complementary spectroscopic techniques. A directional relationship exists between the shape of the osteocyte lacuna and the underlying bone surface. The physico-chemical environment of the lacunar space is, however, different from the surrounding bone matrix, resulting in formation of a calcium phosphate phase more stable than apatite at lower pH, i. e., magnesium whitlockite. Connectivity between osteocytes within unintentionally generated autogenous bone fragments and de novo formed bone on their surface indicates a regenerative capacity of osteocytes. Laser- ablation creates a hierarchical micro- and nanotopography on titanium implants and enhances their biomechanical anchorage. Osteocytes attach directly to such surfaces, while mineralised collagen fibril organisation at bone-implant and bone-osteocyte interfaces is similar. More osteocytes are retained in the vicinity of Ti 6 Al 4 V surface as manufactured by electron beam melting than machined Ti 6 Al 4 V. In addition to cp-Ti and Ti 6 Al 4 V (ASTM F 136), osteocytes also attach to CoCr (ASTM F 75) thus indicating a favourable osteogenic response of a material generally considered inferior to Ti 6 Al 4 V. Therefore, osteocytes reveal vital information about bone quality and are important structural markers of osseointegration. Evaluation of the Ot. LCN can be extremely beneficial in characterising the bone response to materials intended for bone <b>anchored,</b> <b>load</b> bearing applications...|$|E
40|$|Failure {{of several}} gravity {{retaining}} walls in residential areas built on reclaimed land, during the October 23, 2004 Chuetsu earthquake in Niigata Prefecture, Japan, determined {{the authorities to}} consider the seismic retrofit of the walls in order to mitigate future similar disasters in the urban environment. This study addresses the effectiveness of ground anchors in {{improving the seismic performance}} of such retaining structures through a sliding block analysis of the seismic response of an anchored gravity retaining wall supporting a dry homogeneous fill slope subject to horizontal ground shaking. Sliding failure along the base of the wall and translational failure along a planar slip surface of the active wedge within the fill material behind the wall were considered in the formulation, whereas the <b>anchor</b> <b>load</b> was taken as a line load acting {{on the face of the}} gravity retaining wall. The effects of magnitude and orientation of <b>anchor</b> <b>load</b> on the yield acceleration of the wall-backfill system and seismically induced wall displacements were examined. It was found that for the same anchor orientation, the yield acceleration increases in a quasi-linear manner with increasing the <b>anchor</b> <b>load,</b> whereas an <b>anchor</b> <b>load</b> of a given magnitude acting at various orientations produces essentially identical yield accelerations. On the other hand, the computed earthquake-induced permanent displacements of the anchored gravity retaining wall decrease exponentially with increasing magnitude of <b>anchor</b> <b>load.</b> Additionally, the influence of backfill strength properties (e. g., internal friction angle) on the seismic wall displacement appears to diminish considerably for the anchored gravity retaining wall. A dynamic displacement analysis conducted for the anchored gravity retaining wall subjected to various seismic waveforms scaled to the same peak earthquake acceleration revealed a good correlation between the calculated permanent wall displacements and the Arias intensity parameter characterizing the input accelerogram. © Springer Science+Business Media B.

The three installations differ only in that their mass and buoyancy characteristics provide a natural period in pitch at equilibrium of 13 s, 20 s and 34 s respectively. It is verified that the dominant behaviour can be simulated by a relatively simple mathematical model, allowing the critical parameters of peak <b>anchor</b> <b>loads</b> and pitch angles to be calculated and extrapolated to full scale. It is demonstrated from the experimental and simulation results that the mass characteristics of a non surface piercing tower {{can be used to}} offset some of the challenges of moving to shallow water. If done correctly, it is possible to keep horizontal <b>anchor</b> <b>loads</b> under control and reduce vortex-induced transverse loading at the expense of increased pitch motions. Overall, the use of articulated tower installations in water depths of 50 m would appear to be technically feasible, even in exposed areas. The limitations on the size of such structures and the consequences of the resulting pitch accelerations and induced <b>anchor</b> <b>loads</b> are the subject of further study. It is proposed that the model verified herein can be used to further assess their potential at delivering viable wave power position mooring systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{methods of}} slices {{are commonly used}} {{for the analysis of}} slope stability. When <b>anchor</b> <b>loads</b> are involved, they are often treated as point loads, which may lead to abrupt changes in the normal stress distribution on the potential slip surface. As such abrupt changes are not reasonable and do not reflect reality in the field, an alternative approach based on the limit equilibrium principle is proposed for the evaluation of the stability of anchor-reinforced slopes. With this approach, the normal stress distribution over the slip surface before the application of the anchor (i. e., σ 0) is computed by the conventional, rigorous methods of slices, and the normal stress on the slip surface purely induced by the <b>anchor</b> <b>load</b> (i. e., λpσp, where λp is the load factor) is taken as the analytical elastic stress distribution in an infinite wedge approximating the slope geometry, with the <b>anchor</b> <b>load</b> acting on the apex. Then the normal stress on the slip surface for the anchor-reinforced slope is assumed to be the linear combination of these two normal stresses involving two auxiliary unknowns, η 1 and η 2; that is, σ = η 1 σ 0 + η 2 λpσp. Simultaneously solving the horizontal force, the vertical force, and the moment equilibrium equations for the sliding body leads to the explicit expression for the factor of safety (Fs) - or the load factor (λp), if the required factor of safety is prescribed. The reasonableness and advantages of the present method in comparison with the conventional procedures are demonstrated with two illustrative examples. The proposed procedure can be readily applied to designs of excavated slopes or remediation of landslides with steel anchors or prestressed cables, as well as with soil nails or geotextile reinforcements. © 2005 NRC Canada. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

Expansion <b>anchors</b> <b>loaded</b> in tension will often fail in a rather brittle manner by pulling out a concrete cone. The corresponding failure load Fu is approximately proportional to f ct · 1 d 1, 5 (fct = concrete tensile strength. Id = anchorage depth). Anchors placed too close to each other or too close to an edge produce a common cone failure or an edge failure respectively at correspondingly reduced ultimate loads. Assuming a 30 deg. failure cone, the actual behavior can be described with sufficient accuracy for practical purposes. If anchors are placed in cracks, the failure load will be significantly lower than for anchors installed in uncracked concrete, depending on the type and make of anchor and the crack width...|$|R

Results: the mean Rowe score was 83. 8 in group A and 79. 5 in group B. the mean values for the Athletic Shoulder Outcome Scoring System were 84 and 79. 2, respectively. Good or excellent results were found in 90. 5 % of patients in group A and 87. 5 % in group B. We had 2 failures (9. 5 %) in group A and 3 (12. 5 %) in group B.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the behaviour of the perimeter {{wall of a}} very large excavation in saturated sands. The excavation was extended to a depth of 20 m (17 m below the water table) and the walls reached an impervious silty clay formation which appears 55 m below the surface. The reinforced concrete walls were stabilized by a single row of anchors grouted in sand, below the water table. Stabilizing berms were also left unexcavated against the walls to allow reaching the maximum excavation depth in the large central area of the site. Later, basement slabs were built and propped against the walls, before the excavation was completed. A disturbing finding was the large horizontal displacements measured in the walls during the early excavation stages. These large displacements extended to large depths, well beyond the excavation depth. However, <b>anchor</b> <b>loads</b> remained essentially constant throughout the excavation and water lowering operations. Computer results were found in reasonable agreement with available wall displacements and <b>anchor</b> <b>loads.</b> A most interesting part of the analysis was the distribution of movements in the active zone of the walls. It was found that significant displacements extended well beyond the expected distance from the wall. In fact, wall displacements and anchor fixed length displacements were similar in magnitude. This result could be interpreted as an indication of impending failure but further finite element analysis carried out to establish the safety factor against failure showed that the entire system was far from limiting conditions. This effect is related to some features of the project, which include the anchor length, the stiffness of the wall {{and the size of the}} excavated area. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|During an earthquake, {{reinforced}} concrete members {{in a building}} will suffer cracking that oscillates as the building dynamically deforms. Equipment that services the building, such as mechanical and electrical items, are anchored to these components, and therefore will be subjected to this dynamic environment. Despite understanding this practical loading situation, as well as recognizing that <b>anchor</b> <b>load</b> capacity is significantly reduced when an anchor is embedded in cracked concrete, there remains a gap in knowledge regarding the effect of anchorage behavior on nonstructural component response. In particular, the effect of dynamic cyclic cracking coupled with inertia-generated tension load cycling on the anchor and component response has not been studied to date. A new methodology involving experimental equipment and simulation tools is developed for investigating the seismic behavior of anchored nonstructural components and systems that accounts {{for the effects of}} simultaneous <b>anchor</b> tension <b>load</b> cycling and crack cycling on anchor behavior and anchored component response. To support the experimental ingredient of this work, a Cyclic Cracked Inertial Loading Rig (CCILR), Weighted <b>Anchor</b> <b>Loading</b> Laboratory Equipment (WALLE) system, and cracked concrete slabs, are designed and fabricated. Mounting the CCILR and WALLE onto a shake table results in a system that is able to simulate a concrete beam or slab from a building supporting an anchored nonstructural component. System-level shake table tests are conducted on floor mounted model nonstructural components anchored in cyclic cracks using epoxy, expansion, drop-in and undercut anchors to study the effect of a range of anchor types. A nonlinear, lumped hysteresis anchor model is implemented and used to simulate anchor load-displacement response for tension load cycling dominant applications. The anchor model is calibrated against single anchor tests and subsequently extended for use in a system model of the anchored nonstructural components for predicting maximum system response. It was determined that the load-displacement behavior of the anchorage, in particular, the ultimate displacement capacity of the anchor, {{plays an important role in}} the seismic response of tension load cycling dominated floor mounted nonstructural components. The experimental results also support the current code design philosophy for anchors, which specifies that either the anchor or the attachment should be ductile, or the anchor should be designed for a multiple of the expected load demand...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} an upper bound plastic limit analysis for predicting drag <b>anchor</b> trajectory and <b>load</b> capacity. The shank and fluke of the anchor are idealized as simple plates. The failure mechanism involves {{the motion of}} the anchor about a center of rotation, the coordinates of which are systematically optimized to determine the minimum load at the shackle. For a given anchor orientation, the direction of the shackle force is varied to establish a relationship between the magnitude and direction of the shackle load. Coupling this relationship to the Neubecker-Randolph anchor line solution produces a unique solution for the magnitude and orientation of the shackle force. The anchor is then advanced a small increment about the optimum center of rotation and the process is repeated. The upper bound method (UBM) provides a practical means to determine the trajectory of the anchor and the <b>anchor</b> <b>load</b> capacity at any point in the trajectory. To better understand of the anchor behavior, extensive parameter studies were carried out varying the properties of the anchor, anchor line, and soil.

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{a detailed}} buckling {{evaluation of the}} primary tanks in the Hanford double-shell waste tanks (DSTs), {{which is part of}} a comprehensive structural review for the Double-Shell Tank Integrity Project. This work also provides information on tank integrity that specifically responds to concerns raised by the Office of Environment, Safety, and Health (ES&H) Oversight (EH- 22) during a review of work performed on the double-shell tank farms and the operation of the aging waste facility (AWF) primary tank ventilation system. The current buckling review focuses on the following tasks: (1) Evaluate the potential for progressive anchor bolt failure and the appropriateness of the safety factors that were used for evaluating local and global buckling. The analysis will specifically answer the following questions: (a) Can the EH- 22 scenario develop if the vacuum is limited to - 6. 6 -inch water gage (w. g.) by a relief valve? (b) What is the appropriate factor of safety required to protect against buckling if the EH- 22 scenario can develop? (c) What is the appropriate factor of safety required to protect against buckling if the EH- 22 scenario cannot develop? (2) Develop influence functions to estimate the axial stresses in the primary tanks for all reasonable combinations of tank loads based on detailed finite element analysis. The analysis must account for the variation in design details and operating conditions between the different DSTs. The analysis must also address the imperfection sensitivity of the primary tank to buckling. (3) Perform a detailed buckling analysis to determine the maximum allowable differential pressure for each of the DST primary tanks at the current specified limits on waste temperature, height, and specific gravity. Based on the concrete <b>anchor</b> bolt <b>loads</b> analysis and the small deformations that are predicted at the unfactored limits on vacuum and axial loads, it is very unlikely that the EH- 22 scenario (i. e., progressive anchor bolt failure leading to global buckling of the tank under increased vacuum) could occur.

This paper discusses the experimental investigations made on the strength and failure modes of bonded anchors in concrete.

It has been observed that concrete cone failure was predominant in all the specimens. The anchorage strength increases as the compressive strength of concrete increases. As the embedment length of anchor increases, the anchorage strength also increases. The diameter of the anchor does show much influence {{on the strength of}} anchorage.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Results from load tests conducted on ten, full-scale instrumented ground anchors installed in stiff clay, illustrated that anchor performance is load-history dependent. Anchors having shorter bonded lengths performed significantly better than anchors with longer bonded lengths. Therefore, shorter bonded lengths might, in some cases, provide a more efficient anchorage system.

Furthermore, the influence of several parameters, including tensile ductility, tensile strength, compressive strength and modulus of elasticity, on the anchor pullout behavior was clarified numerically. It was demonstrated that the intrinsic tensile ductility in ECC led to significant enhancement of load and displacement capacities. Once the failure mode was switched from brittle to ductile, however, the tensile strength governed the pullout load capacity. Finally, a design equation for predicting <b>anchor</b> pullout <b>load</b> capacity was proposed based on the numerical results and verified by experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Helical anchors are {{a type of}} deep {{foundation}} element that can be installed quickly in almost any location and can accept the immediate application of operational loads. The use of helical anchors has expanded in recent decades from its established application in the power transmission industry to more traditional civil engineering applications such as residential construction, communication tower installations, and static and seismic structural retrofitting and reconstruction. Despite {{the wide range of}} helical anchor applications, few advances have been made in improving the understanding of their behavior. For example, existing helical anchor design methods, for cases where the <b>anchors</b> are <b>loaded</b> in uplift in cohesive soils, are {{based on the assumption that}} the soil above the helical plate is mobilized in a manner analogous to that beneath a {{deep foundation}} in bearing. An appropriate design method would acknowledge the effect of load directionality on the assumed failure mechanism. This thesis evaluates the existing cylindrical shear and individual plate bearing design methods for helical anchor capacity in uplift. Additionally, new capacity models are proposed to improve prediction accuracy and reduce prediction variability. A load test database of helical <b>anchors</b> <b>loaded</b> in tension is established from tests reported in the literature. The existing and proposed capacity models are compared to the capacities observed during loading tests using the statistical bias and its distribution. Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) resistance factors are derived from closed-form solutions using First Order Second Moment (FOSM) reliability procedures. Finally, load-displacement models are developed through the evaluation of observed individual anchor plate breakout behavior and back-calculation of side shear capacity from load tests on multi-plate anchors. The new displacement models are compared to the load-displacement tests in the database. In general the comparisons indicate that the displacement-based models developed in this thesis provide a reasonable estimate of load-displacement behavior of helical anchors for service-level displacements. These findings provide engineers with new tools for design of helical anchor foundations...|$|R
25|$|Three {{principal}} {{kinds of}} docks existed. Wet docks were where ships were laid up at <b>anchor</b> and <b>loaded</b> or unloaded. Dry docks, which were far smaller, took individual ships for repairing. Ships were built at dockyards along the riverside. In addition, {{the river was}} lined with innumerable warehouses, piers, jetties and dolphins (mooring points). The various docks tended to specialise in different forms of produce. The Surrey Docks concentrated on timber, for instance; Millwall took grain; St Katharine took wool, sugar and rubber; and so on.|$|R
40|$|A high {{proportion}} of clinically successful rotator cuff repairs are left with residual deficiencies in the cuff itself. 8, 9 Suture anchor fixation for rotator cuff repairs has gained popularity in the recent past. Several studies have investigated the biomechanical characteristics of rotator cuff repairs {{in an effort to}} identify possible sites of failure. These sites have included failure via suture cutting through bone tunnels, suture breakage, knot slippage, suture anchor pullout, and soft tissue failure at the suture-tendon junction. Meyer et al 11 recently detailed that suture breakage at the anchor eyelet may in fact be a significant concern for the strength of soft tissue repairs using suture anchors. They tested 22 different metallic suture <b>anchors</b> <b>loaded</b> with No. 2 braided nonabsorbable suture material. In every case, the suture broke at the anchor eyelet at up to 73 % lower loads than when the suture was tested on a smooth hook. We hypothesized that a previously unrecognized phenomenon {{may play a role in}} the failure mode of rotator cuff repairs: varying the depth of suture anchor insertion. Two variables may play a role in exposing the suture/anchor eyelet to untoward forces. First, Roth et al have shown that anchors inserted into the glenoid settle to the cortical surface with cyclic loading. 14 This settin...|$|R
40|$|Granular anchors (GAs) are a {{relatively}} new concept in ground engineering {{and can be used}} to resist uplift/pullout forces and compressive forces in addition to the ground improvement provided. The GA consists of three main components: a base plate; tendon and compacted granular backfill. Under direct pullout loading, the vertical centrally-located tendon transmits the <b>anchor</b> <b>load</b> applied at the ground surface to the column base via the base plate, compressing the granular column, causing significant dilation of the granular material to occur, thereby forming the anchor. In this study, experimental field tests in intact lodgement till and numerical analysis were performed to investigate the load?displacement behaviour, modes of failure and ultimate pullout capacity of these anchors for the undrained (short-term) condition. The pullout capacity is increased by increasing the anchor surface area either by increasing the anchor length L and/or diameter D. The GAs displaced significantly under loading, with pullout failure generally occurring for anchor displacements of ? ~ D/ 2. The numerical analysis confirmed that the applied tension load was simultaneously resisted by localised bulging {{in the vicinity of the}} column base and by shaft resistance mobilised along the column length, with the dominant failure mode governed by the column L/D ratio. Short GAs (L/D 7) by localized end-bulging, concentrated over a length of approximately 2 ? 3 D from the column base...|$|R
40|$|<b>Anchor</b> <b>loads</b> on {{pipelines}} are {{in general}} a rarely occurring event, but the severity {{when it happens}} could easily jeopardize the integrity of any pipeline. The environmental and economic consequences of an accident caused by dragging anchors could be substantial. The offshore pipeline density at several locations in the North Sea is high. High pipeline density combined with high vessel density {{increase the risk of}} accidents related to anchor-pipeline interaction. Currently, there is an ongoing project between DNV GL and Statoil to come out with a new recommended practice for <b>anchor</b> <b>loads</b> on pipelines. The research on anchor-pipeline interaction is quite limited, however some studies on dropped and dragged anchors are conducted. The studies on the subject anchor-pipeline interactions primarily focus on the potential damage an anchor may inflict on a pipeline, the replacement length when accidents happen and risk studies. One of the observations from the simulations of anchor-pipeline interactions carried out so far is that numerical problems might occur for the contact element CONT 164. One of the goals of this work was to establish models for the hooking event using a new contact element developed by Vegard Longva as part of his PhD work at NTNU. Simulations of eleven models were conducted to demonstrate the performance of the new contact element. 55 % of the models showed unrealistic behavior when the anchor-pipeline interaction was modelled with the old contact element, CONT 164. A simulation was classified as unrealistic if the anchor pierced the pipeline, or if the anchor grossly deformed. All models tested showed a realistic behavior when the anchor geometry and contact were modelled with the new contact element. The objective of this thesis is to study the behavior of the anchor when it collides with an offshore pipeline. A parametric study was performed to investigate the response of the anchor. 250 simulations of anchor-pipeline interactions were performed. The parameters investigated were vessel velocity, pipe diameter, anchor size, span height, damping of the system, sloping seabed, seabed conditions, angle of attack between the anchor and the pipeline and water depth. The pipeline was modelled as a ten-meter-long constrained rigid body in the parametric study. The parametric study indicated that the probability of an anchor hooking onto a pipeline increases with decreasing vessel speed, decreasing pipe diameter and increasing anchor size. The trend is that the hooking ratio increases with increasing anchor mass. However, it is not given that a large anchor hooks onto a pipeline even though a smaller anchor did hook onto the same pipeline. The hooking ratio is highest when the pipeline is partly buried. Increasing the span height decreases the hooking ratio. None of the models hooked the pipeline in the parametric study when the angle of attack between the anchor and the pipeline was 30 or 60 degrees. 24 case studies were performed to investigate how well the anchor s response had been predicted in the parametric study. The pipeline was modelled as ten-kilometers-long and the pipeline was only constrained at the end nodes. In general, the parametric study was good at predicting the response of the anchor-pipeline interaction when the pipeline was not in free span...|$|R
