Besides the introduction and conclusions, the study consists of three main parts. The first part deals with concise delimitation of Popper’s method of deductive testing of scientifi c statements, theories, and hypotheses. In the second part, the strong version <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> is compared with the weak version <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> in sociological knowledge.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the ideal <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> in science. My aim is to understand and situate how objectivity has been conceptualized {{in the philosophy of}} science, and to question whether these conceptualizations are consistent with the actual ways in which objectivity has been sought in scientific practice. I examine the dominant views <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> in mainstream philosophy of science and feminist reactions to them. Ultimately, I argue that Helen Longino’s understanding <b>of</b> <b>objectivity,</b> complemented by some aspects of Sandra Harding’s “strong objectivity”, provides a more comprehensive and practical ideal to guide scientific practice than the received view’s conception where objectivity is sought by adopting an impersonal methodology. One of the main criticisms against feminist epistemologies, which argue for the gender specificity of knowledge, is that they lead to epistemic relativism. And hence it is argued that feminist epistemologies undermine “scientific objectivity”. In arguing for the fruitfulness and consistency of a feminist account <b>of</b> <b>objectivity,</b> I examine in what ways claims about the gender specificity of knowledge could be understood without rendering the notion <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> redundant...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses issues {{relevant to}} philosophy of science {{as well as}} epistemology. I discuss the various definitions <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> and objective knowledge in science, and I argue for a dialectical sense <b>of</b> <b>objectivity.</b> This sense <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> holds that interaction between subject and object, between multiple subjects, and between subjects and their social/historical context are constitutive of the achievement of objective knowledge. Dialectical objectivity stands in contrast to other senses <b>of</b> <b>objectivity,</b> that advocate a strict separation of knower and the known {{in order to reduce}} or deny any subjective influences on knowledge claims. I clarify my notion <b>of</b> dialectical <b>objectivity</b> by comparing it to the work of other philosophers of science (such as Latour and Adorno) as well as by showing its historical roots in Hegel. Also, I apply the concept <b>of</b> dialectical <b>objectivity</b> to a case study from the history of sonar and underwater imaging technologies. The history of sonar technology involves the military-industrial complex, various countries, the academy, engineers, and popular culture. The recent shift to acoustic daylight imaging technology, which gives a new and significant role to the ambient underwater noise environment, has important philosophical implications. Acoustic daylight imaging reconceives the underwater world and its objects for sonar technicians and researchers, and holds that interaction with the underwater context produces knowledge. I argue that this combination of social interaction between various knowers, and the interaction between the knower and known, are best explicated by the dialectical sense <b>of</b> <b>objectivity.</b> Next I show how the dialectical sense <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> enriches the work of Philip Kitcher, clarifying his tools for characterizing scientific progress, and addressing criticism of his work with regard to the correspondence theory of truth. Finally, I argue that there are profitable connections between the dialectical sense <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> and the work of Sandra Harding on strong objectivity, and that those connections may provide a new common ground for mainstream and feminist philosophers of science...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the theoretical approaches and models <b>of</b> <b>objectivity.</b> The very notion <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> is displayed by two opposing theories: the empathic and the factual. As such, these theories are studied {{as a framework}} towards the {{deeper understanding of the}} problem <b>of</b> <b>objectivity,</b> which at its core, makes up the very essence of ethics. Journalistic ethics, in particular, are considered to be the most fundamental segment for objective reporting in all conditions, especially in crisis situations, or ratherthose considered the most complex conditions of journalistic engagement. This essay seeks to present the most important theories utilized in the exploration <b>of</b> journalistic <b>objectivity</b> in crisis situations.

40|$|Objective truth has {{traditionally}} been conceived of {{in terms of a}} thought’s representation of or correspondence with an immutable reality. Thomas Kuhn’s evolutionary picture of science based on notions of incommensurable paradigms, different worlds and revolutionary ruptures shatters the traditional, representationalist view of scientific development and is often seen as impugning the very notion <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> along with this positivistic view of science. In this essay I argue that embracing Kuhn’s picture of science need not entail disclaiming objectivity if we move beyond the idea that objectivity must be thought of in terms of representations and fact-value dualisms. If we think <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> as the idea that everyone could be wrong about something and, thus, that objects can bring down theoretical systems, we find, with the help of John Haugeland, that there is a tenable and textured notion <b>of</b> antirepresentationalist <b>objectivity</b> implicit in Kuhn’s work. This Kuhnian notion <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> allows us to go beyond the disposal <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> that Richard Rorty finds necessary in jettisoning the broken Cartesian representationalist and dualistic epistemological tradition Rorty rightly criticizes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] This paper {{presents}} both formal {{as well as}} practical well-definedness {{conditions for}} kinematic metric functions. To formulate these conditions, we introduce an intrinsic definition of a rigid body's configuration space. Based on this definition, the principle <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> is introduced to derive a formal condition for well-definedness of kinematic metric functions, {{as well as to}} gain physical insight into left, right and bi-invariances on the Lie group SE(3). We then relate the abstract notion <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> to the more intuitive notion of frameinvariance, and show that frame-invariance {{can be used as a}} practical condition for determining objective functions.

Some feminist legal scholars, some critical race scholars, and some critical legal studies scholars, along with some contemporary philosophers, argue that objectivity is inevitably a problematic, dangerous idea or ideal. Critics <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> sometimes argue that it can never be genuinely had, only claimed under false pretenses and then used oppressively...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The notion <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> in the Hegelian {{conceptual}} constellation is one that, if not ambiguous, is {{at least}} characterized by a strong polysemy. This paper considers the significance that “objectivity” assumes for Hegel in relation to logic; it therefore also {{raises questions about the}} kind <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> Hegel at- tributes to logical thought. The thesis defended is that one can understand the Hegelian notion <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> only if one recognizes the inextricable bond be- tween the epistemological and the ontological in Hegel’s philosophy, or rather, only if one acknowledges the radical critique Hegel directs at the modern gap between epistemological and ontological dimensions. It is shown that the Hege- lian notion <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> should be understood neither in traditionally epistemo- logical terms (as a notion belonging to some theory of knowledge or epistemol- ogy) nor in purely ontological terms (as a property exclusive to being, facts, or the states of things) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} <b>of</b> the <b>objectivity</b> <b>of</b> law rotates {{around the}} determination of the status of the norms that constitute the major premise of the practical syllogism representing the formal scheme of the justification of judicial decisions.

The different versions <b>of</b> the <b>objectivity</b> <b>of</b> law reject this sceptical conclusion. The strongest versions <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> accepted by the different doctrines of natural law presuppose metaphysical realism and rule out the idea that what seems correct to someone can determine what is effectively correct; the weakest versions, upheld by legal positivism, believe – at least in relation to the existence of legal social practice – that what seems correct to most members of a community determines what is effectively correct. Does a space exist between these two versions <b>of</b> <b>objectivity?</b> In this essay arguments are put forward in support of a negative answer...|$|R

Similarities and differences {{arising from the}} two approaches and their effect on modeling in turbulence are discussed in detail. The use of the absolute spin for noninertial frames and of the net spin for superposed rigid-body motions in closure representations for the pressure-strain-rate correlations tensor are critically discussed. The enigmatic statement made by Speziale that the frame-indifference or <b>objectivity</b> <b>of</b> Reynolds stress does not establish the validity of material frame-indifference in turbulence and the subsequent case-study test <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> under superposed rigid-body mean motion within a rotating frame presented to prove it are investigated and fully explained. It is shown analytically that such apparently contrasting conclusions on the validity <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> result from the application <b>of</b> the <b>objectivity</b> test to the mean rather than the instantaneous motion, a case not encountered in classical continuum mechanics, which considers only one motion, the instantaneous.

40|$|In {{classical}} Continuum Mechanics, Principle <b>of</b> <b>Objectivity</b> {{requires that}} balance laws and constitutive equations must be form-invariant {{with respect to}} rigid motions of the spatial frame of reference. Any tensorial quantity {{is said to be}} objective if it obeys the appropriate tensor transformation law. Quantities such as temperature and stress tensor are known to be objective. In Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation, which is a prevalent numerical method in nanoscience on atomistic basis, Principle <b>of</b> <b>Objectivity</b> was rarely discussed. This research explores the objectivity issue in the classical MD by examining the governing equation and constitutive equation. It can be shown that the interatomic potential and the corresponding interatomic force are objective because they are determined by relative atomic positions, which are objective. On the other hand, velocity and relative velocity are not objective. As a consequence, quantities such as temperature and Virial stress that are calculated based on apparent atomic velocities are not objective. Therefore, multiphysics body forces generated by these nonobjective quantities are not objective either. This becomes problematic when the system or subsystem is described in a noninertial reference frame, i. e., the reference frame undergoes acceleration or rotation. To resolve this deficiency, this research proposes the theory <b>of</b> <b>Objectivity</b> Incorporated MD. With the adoption of an objective form <b>of</b> velocity, the <b>objectivity</b> <b>of</b> temperature and Virial stress are restored. The theory also requires all kinds of body forces to be objective so that the constitutive equation well satisfies the Principle <b>of</b> <b>Objectivity.</b> The theory further supplements the governing equation with fictitious force, which accounts for the motion of reference frame, so that MD simulation can be extended to noninertial reference frame. It is considered that the application <b>of</b> Principle <b>of</b> <b>Objectivity</b> on MD will provide more power and credibility to the simulations of complex systems...|$|R
