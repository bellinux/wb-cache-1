5|$|Accurate {{assessment}} of red-billed tropicbird numbers is difficult {{due to the}} remote locations of nesting sites and vast areas of sea they might be found. This bird {{is considered to be}} a least-concern species according to the IUCN. This is due to the fact that the range, declination, <b>and</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> this species, although small, do not meet the criteria required to be considered a vulnerable species. The range of this species is believed to be , with an estimated 3,300 to 13,000 mature individuals. In the western Atlantic, a more precise number was given for the population there in 2000; about 4,000 to 5,000 pairs. The population is declining, mainly due to human exploitation of the bird's environment and predation by invasive species, such as rats. These predators have the potential to drive populations of the red-billed tropicbird into serious decline. It is estimated that this bird experienced a population bottleneck about 450 to 750 years ago, likely due to exploitation by humans. This has resulted in low genetic diversity in this tropicbird, which makes the likelihood of it adapting to sudden environmental changes low. In Mexico and Brazil, it is considered to be threatened.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of its target value and vulnerability, {{aircraft}} carriers are always escorted by at least one submarine for protection. The other vessels in the Strike Group provide additional capabilities, such as long range Tomahawk missiles or the Aegis Combat System, and also protect the carrier from attack. A typical Strike Group may include, in addition to an aircraft carrier: up to six surface combatants, including frigates (since retired from USN service), guided missile cruisers and guided missile destroyers (used primarily for anti-aircraft warfare and anti-submarine warfare); one or two attack submarines (for seeking out and destroying hostile surface ships and submarines); and an ammunition, oiler, and supply ship of Military Sealift Command to provide logistical support.

40|$|Yayın tarihi 29 Mayıs, 2007 © TurkJBiochem. com [Published online 29 May, 2007] Insulin is {{a hormone}} that regulates blood glucose levels. Its {{deficiency}} or over secretion cause many disorders including polyurea, polydipsia, {{and weight loss}} in metabolism. Publications to date show strict relationships between insulin level <b>and</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> insulin receptors in a cell. In this respect a mathematical estimation on insulin level <b>and</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> insulin receptors may be important {{in order to understand}} some diseases related to insulin level <b>and</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> insulin receptors. In the present study, a queueing theory originated model is applied to insulin level <b>and</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> insulin receptors. Based on real data, some parameters such as optimum insulin level, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> insulin receptor <b>and</b> minimum required energy spent were calculated by using queueing theory. Our results show an indirect correlation between insulin level and receptor. The total energy spent is also decreased up to optimum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> insulin receptors <b>and</b> then it is increased. From the results, it could be said that queuing theory predicts the optimal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> insulin receptors. In conclusion, the data reveals that queueing theory can be applied to insulin level <b>and</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> insulin receptors. Estimation of insulin levels in insulin-insulin receptor complex <b>and</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> insulin receptors obtained through queueing analysis may identify etiological origins of some insulin-based metabolic disorders...|$|R
