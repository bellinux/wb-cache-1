5|$|The {{first attempt}} to build a modern trade route through the area is {{credited}} to William Jackson Palmer, founder of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D). Palmer started <b>a</b> <b>project</b> <b>in</b> 1880 to make {{what had been a}} local railroad from Colorado into a transcontinental railroad empire. This would mean a second transcontinental railroad would be built across Utah. This would also place the D in competition with the First Transcontinental Railroad, then operated by Union Pacific Railroad and Central Pacific Railroad.|$|E
5|$|In Jersey, the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, in {{partnership}} with the States of Jersey and the National Trust for Jersey began <b>a</b> <b>project</b> <b>in</b> 2010, aimed at restoring selected areas of Jersey's coastline with the intention of returning those birds that had become locally extinct. The red-billed chough was chosen as a flagship species for this project, having been absent from Jersey since around 1900. Durrell initially received two pairs of choughs from Paradise Park in Cornwall and began a captive breeding programme. In 2012, the red-billed choughs were living free in the central valley area of Durrell Wildlife Park, and the Trust expects colonisation of the coastal areas of Jersey in the following years.|$|E
5|$|In the {{southern}} part of Asia including Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam, crickets are commonly eaten as a snack, prepared by deep frying the soaked and cleaned insects. In Thailand, there are 20,000 farmers rearing crickets, with an estimated production of 7,500 tons per year and United Nation's FAO has implemented <b>a</b> <b>project</b> <b>in</b> Laos to improve cricket farming and consequently food security. The food conversion efficiency of house crickets (Acheta domesticus) is 1.7, some five times higher than that for beef cattle, and if their fecundity is taken into account, 15 to 20 times higher.|$|E

5|$|Woodenlegs, {{unsure what}} to do with the material, passed them to Weist, who at the time was writing a Cheyenne history for use in {{reservation}} schools. The negatives were contained in a battered shoebox, and some were in poor condition. Weist involved photographer Jerry Mader to work on their restoration. Weist, Mader, and Woodenlegs began <b>a</b> <b>project</b> <b>in</b> the 1960s to make the images available in reservation schools. Without funds for publication, however, the project was abandoned in 1981 on the death of Woodenlegs. Weist died in 1994. The negatives were passed to anthropologist Margot Liberty in 1998 by a remaining project member, Elizabeth Wilson Clark, shortly before her death. Liberty had been a teacher at the Northern Cheyenne reservation in the 1950s, and she agreed to edit the material into a book for the University of Oklahoma Press. Finally, 142 of the images were published in 2006 as A Northern Cheyenne Album. The book includes a commentary from Woodenlegs recorded years before.|$|E
