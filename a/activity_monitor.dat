40|$|Abstract Background Understanding the {{relationships}} between physical activity (PA) and disease {{has become a major}} area of research interest. <b>Activity</b> <b>monitors,</b> devices that quantify free-living PA for prolonged periods of time (days or weeks), are increasingly being used to estimate PA. A range of different <b>activity</b> <b>monitors</b> brands are available for investigators to use, but little is known about how they respond to different levels of PA in the field, nor if data conversion between brands is possible. Methods 56 women and men were fitted with two different <b>activity</b> <b>monitors,</b> the Actigraph™ (Actigraph LLC; AGR) and the Actical™ (Mini-Mitter Co.; MM) for 15 days. Both <b>activity</b> <b>monitors</b> were fixed to an elasticized belt worn over the hip, with the anterior and posterior position of the <b>activity</b> <b>monitors</b> randomized. Differences between <b>activity</b> <b>monitors</b> and the validity of brand inter-conversion were measured by t -tests, Pearson correlations, Bland-Altman plots, and coefficients of variation (CV). Results The AGR detected a significantly greater amount of daily PA (216. 2 ± 106. 2 vs. 188. 0 ± 101. 1 counts/min, P Conclusion Although <b>activity</b> <b>monitors</b> predict PA on the same scale (counts/min), the results between these two brands are not directly comparable. However, the data are comparable if a conversion equation is applied, with better results for log-transformed data. </p...|$|R

40|$|Consumer-level <b>activity</b> <b>monitors,</b> such as Fitbit and Misfit devices, are {{a popular}} and {{low-cost}} means of measuring physical activity. This study aims {{to compare the}} accuracy of step counts from two consumer-level <b>activity</b> <b>monitors</b> against two reference devices in healthy, community dwelling older adults in free-living conditions. Twenty-five older adults (aged 65 - 84) simultaneously wore 5 devices (e. g. Misfit Shine and Fitbit Charge HR) over 7 consecutive days. All consumer-level <b>activity</b> <b>monitors</b> positively correlated with reference devices (p< 0. 001). There was also substantial to near perfect agreement between all consumer-level <b>activity</b> <b>monitors</b> and reference devices. Compared to the Actigraph GT 3 X+, the waist worn Misfit Shine displayed the highest agreement amongst the devices worn (ICC= 0. 96, 95 % 0. 91 to 0. 99). The wrist worn devices showed poorer agreement to reference devices.
