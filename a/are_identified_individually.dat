40|$|We {{report a}} method to {{determine}} the quantum detection efficiency and the absorbing layers on a front-illuminated charge-coupled device (CCD). The CCD under study, {{as part of a}} crystal spectrometer, measures intense continuum x-ray emission from a picosecond laser-produced plasma and spectrally resolves the Si K-edge x-ray absorption fine structure features due to the electrode gate structure of the device. The CCD response across the Si K-edge shows a large discontinuity {{as well as a number}} of oscillations that <b>are</b> <b>identified</b> <b>individually</b> and uniquely from Si, SiO{sub 2 }, and Si{sub 3 }N{sub 4 } layers.

40|$|Abstract: Anonymizing {{networks}} {{hide the}} client’s IP address {{and allow the}} client to access the internet. It protects the privacy of users but unfortunately some users have misused such networks for abusive purposes. Website administrators block the IP addresses of misbehaving users {{and as a result}} they block all the known exit nodes of the anonymizing networks, denying anonymous access to misbehaving and behaving users alike. Since the server does not identify individual user’s activities all the users are blocked from accessing resources of the server from the particular anonymous network. In the proposed system the users <b>are</b> <b>identified</b> <b>individually</b> without revealing their identity. Nymble is the proposed system in which the servers can “blacklist ” misbehaving users, thereby blocking users without compromising their anonymity. The system detects the misbehaving users and adds them to the blacklist. Thus the server can blacklist the misbehaving users without knowledge of their IP address and allows behaving users to connect anonymously. Those of the users in the blacklist are blocked from accessing the resources for a specified time that is set by the administrators. The proposed system has several important properties which overcomes the drawbacks of the existing system. The properties are anonymous authentication, backward unlinkability, subjective blacklisting, fast authentication speeds, blacklist sharing, rate limited anonymous connections, revocation auditability and also addresses Sybil attacks...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} results of a {{high-resolution}} X-ray imaging study of the stellar population in the Galactic massive star-forming region RCW 49 and its central OB association Westerlund 2. We obtained a ∼ 40 ks X-ray image of a ∼ 17 ′× 17 ′ field using the Chandra X-ray Observatory and deep near-infrared (NIR) images using the Infrared Survey Facility in a concentric ∼ 8. ′ 3 × 8. ′ 3 region. We detected 468 X-ray sources and identified optical, NIR, and Spitzer Space Telescope mid-infrared (MIR) counterparts for 379 of them. The unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity of the X-ray image, enhanced by optical and infrared imaging data, yielded the following results: (1) The central OB association Westerlund 2 is resolved {{for the first time in}} the X-ray band. X-ray emission is detected from all spectroscopically-identified early-type stars in this region. (2) Most (∼ 86 %) X-ray sources with optical or infrared identifications are cluster members in comparison with a control field in the Galactic Plane. (3) A loose constraint (2 – 5 kpc) for the distance to RCW 49 is derived from the mean X-ray luminosity of T Tauri stars. (4) The cluster X-ray population consists of low-mass pre–main-sequence and early-type stars as obtained from X-ray and NIR photometry. About 30 new OB star candidates are identified. (5) We estimate a cluster radius of 6 ′- 7 ′ based on the X-ray surface number density profiles. (6) A large fraction (∼ 90 %) of cluster members <b>are</b> <b>identified</b> <b>individually</b> using complimentary X-ray and MIR excess emission.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the current research was to develop an automated algorithm with no or little user assistance for extraction of Subdural Grid Electrodes (SGE) from post-implant MRI scans for epilepsy surgery. The algorithm utilizes the knowledge about the artifacts created by Subdural Electrodes (SE) in MRI scans. Also the algorithm does not only extract individual electrodes, but it also extracts them as a SGE structures. Information about the number and type of implanted electrodes is recorded during the surgery [1]. This information is used to reduce the search space and produce better results. Currently, the extraction of SGE from post-implant MRI scans is performed manually by a technologist [1, 2, 3]. It is a time-consuming process, requiring on average a few hours, depending {{on the number of}} implanted SE. In addition, the process does not conserve the geometry of the structures, since electrodes <b>are</b> <b>identified</b> <b>individually.</b> Usually SGE extraction is complicated by nearby artifacts, making manual extraction a non-trivial task that requires a good visualization of 3 D space and orientation of SGE in it. Currently, most of the technologists use 2 D slice viewers for extraction of SGE from 3 D MRI scans. There is no commercial software to perform the automated extraction task. The only algorithm suggested in the literature is [4]. The goal of the proposed algorithm is to improve the performance of the algorithm in [4]. As a goal, the proposed algorithm performs extraction of SGE not only for individual electrodes, but by applying geometric constraints on SGE. M. S.

40|$|The Oligocene to Quaternary {{succession}} {{encountered in}} CRP- 2 / 2 A {{is divided into}} twelve recurrent lithofacies (some {{of which have been}} subdivided further), reflecting a range of marine, glacimarine and possibly subglacial environments of sediment accumulation. A cyclical vertical arrangement of lithofacies was noted throughout the core, and is used as the basis for a sequence stratigraphic analysis. Twenty-four sequences are recognised, each of which begins with a Sequence Boundary (Glacial Surface of Erosion), and each is interpreted to record a cycle of glacial advance and retreat with associated changes in relative sea-level. During at least some of these cycles, ice is interpreted to have extended as far as and seaward of the drill-site. A recent reinterpretation of seismic reflection data by Henrys et al. (this volume) permits the first correlation between seismic reflection records and the stratigraphic surfaces identified herein. All but one of the reflectors recognised correspond to sequence boundaries, and most reflectors correspond to the base of thin, truncated and amalgamated sequences. Additionally, three thick and relatively complete sequences (9 to 11) <b>are</b> <b>identified</b> <b>individually</b> by seismic reflectors. The major surfaces of omission in CRP- 2 / 2 A, identified from a variety of evidence, correspond to changes in cross-sectional geometry in the seismic records, {{and in the case of}} the unconformity at 307 mbsf can be interpreted as recording the onset of a phase of active tectonic subsidence associated with half-graben development, bounded by periods of more uniform, slower, possibly thermal subsidence. Possible controls on cyclicity are discussed, and include long-term eustatic cycles, Milankovitch frequency cycles, and more local climatic and/or tectonic events. The analysis allows the recognition and separation of tectonic from climatic (?glacio-eustatic) controls on the Cainozoic stratigraphy of the McMurdo Sound regio...|$|E

50|$|A {{coordinate}} {{measuring machine}} (CMM) that works at the nanoscale would have a smaller frame than the CMM used for macroscale objects. This is so because it may provide the necessary stiffness and stability to achieve nanoscale uncertainties in x,y and z directions. The probes for such a machine need to be small to enable a 3-D measurement of nanometre features from the sides and from inside like nanoholes. Also for accuracy laser interferometers need to be used. NIST has developed a surface measuring instrument, called the Molecular Measuring Machine. This instrument is basically an STM.

Participants were correctly able to identify the target odor when given either 2 or 6 matches.
