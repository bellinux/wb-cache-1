25|$|During the operation, {{the lymph}} nodes in the axilla are also {{considered}} for removal. In the past, large axillary operations took out 10 to 40 nodes to establish whether cancer had spread. This had the unfortunate side effect of frequently causing lymphedema of the arm on the same side, as the removal of this many lymph nodes affected lymphatic drainage. More recently, the technique of sentinel lymph node (SLN) dissection has become popular, as it requires the removal of far fewer lymph nodes, resulting in fewer side effects while achieving the same 10-year survival as its predecessor. The sentinel lymph node is the first node that drains the tumor, and subsequent SLN mapping can save 65-70% of patients with breast cancer from having a complete lymph node dissection for what {{could turn out to}} be a negative nodal basin. Advances in Sentinel Lymph Node mapping over the past decade have increased the accuracy of detecting Sentinel Lymph Node from 80% using blue dye alone to between 92% and 98% using combined modalities. SLN biopsy is indicated for patients with T1 and T2 lesions (<5nbsp&cm) and carries a number of recommendations for use on patient subgroups. Recent trends continue to favor less radical <b>axillar</b> node resection even in the presence of some metastases in the sentinel node.|$|E

50|$|Definitive {{diagnosis}} of humerus fractures is typically made through radiographic imaging. For proximal fractures, X-rays {{can be taken}} from a scapular anteroposterior (AP) view, which takes {{an image of the}} front of the shoulder region from an angle, a scapular Y view, which takes an image {{of the back of the}} shoulder region from an angle, and an <b>axillar</b> lateral view, which has the patient lie on his or her back, lift the bottom half of the arm up to the side, and have an image taken of the axilla region underneath the shoulder. Fractures of the humerus shaft are usually correctly identified with radiographic images taken from the AP and lateral viewpoints. Damage to the radial nerve from a shaft fracture can be identified by an inability to bend the hand backwards or by decreased sensation in the back of the hand. Images of the distal region are often of poor quality due to the patient being unable to extend the elbow because of pain. If a severe distal fracture is supected, then a computed tomography (CT) scan can provide greater detail of the fracture. Nondisplaced distal fractures may not be directly visible; they may only be visible due to fat being displaced because of internal bleeding in the elbow.|$|E

50|$|The gynoecium is bicarpelar (rarely three- or five-locular) with a {{superior}} ovary and two locules, {{which may be}} secondarily divided by false septa, {{as is the case}} for Nicandreae and Datureae. The gynoecium is located in an oblique position relative to the flower’s median plane. They have one style and one stigma; the latter is simple or bilobate. Each locule has one to 50 ovules that are anatropous or hemianatropous with <b>axillar</b> placentation. The development of the embryo sack can be the same as for Polygonum or Allium species. The embryo sack’s nuclear poles become fused before fertilization. The three antipodes are usually ephemeral or persistent {{as in the case of}} Atropa. The fruit can be a berry as in the case of the tomato or wolfberry a dehiscent capsule as in Datura, or a drupe. The fruit has axial placentation. The capsules are normally septicidal or rarely loculicidal or valvate. The seeds are usually endospermic, oily (rarely starchy), and without obvious hairs. The seeds of most Solanaceae are round and flat, about 2 - 4 mm in diameter. The embryo can be straight or curved, and has two cotyledons. Most species in the Solanaceae have 2n=24 chromosomes, but the number may be a higher multiple of 12 due to polyploidy. Wild potatoes, of which there are about 200, are predominantly diploid (2 × 12 = 24 chromosomes), but triploid (3 × 12 = 36 chromosomes), tetraploid (4 × 12 = 48 chromosomes), pentaploid (5 × 12 = 60) and even hexaploid (6 × 12 = 72 chromosome) species or populations exist. The cultivated species Solanum tuberosum has 4 × 12 = 48 chromosomes. Some Capsicum species have 2 × 12 = 24 chromosomes, while others have 26 chromosomes.|$|E

40|$|Either radical mastectomy with <b>axillar</b> lymphadenectomy or {{conservative}} surgery with <b>axillar</b> lymph node dissection are the standard treatments {{for patients with}} breast carcinoma.

This study aimed {{to determine the}} long-term outcomes associated to video-assisted thoracic sympathotomy (VATS) of T 2, T 3 and T 4 ganglia for these cases. METHODS: Analysis of the outcomes obtained from 36 patients regarding the rate of resolution of the symptoms and the compensatory sweating (CS). All subjects were followed-up for 36 months. RESULTS: Good outcomes were observed in 98. 6 % for palmar and 60 % for axillary hyperhidrosis (p= 0. 0423), respectively. Of the subjects, 86 % reported some postoperative episode of CS, however only 45 % (p= 0. 0031) still noticed {{it at the end}} of the follow-up period.

40|$|Introduction The {{consequences}} {{of failing to}} notice fever in children can be serious. On the other hand, false positive reading can result in unnecessary investigation or diagnostic approach. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare different ways of body temperature measurement. Material and methods This prospective study was carried out on Pediatric Department of General Hospital in Subotica during 10 months (March-December 2006). In 263 children aged 1 month to 18 years of age, the body temperature was obtained from 4 measurement sites: tactile assessment, forehead and ear by electronic thermometer, rectal temperature in small children (up to 2 years of age) or <b>axillar</b> temperature in older children by mercury thermometer. Tympanic thermometry was considered as a standard for fever detection. Results The sensitivity of rectal temperature to detect fever is 46. 67 %, while specificity is 92. 19 %. The sensitivity of fever detection by electronic thermometry on the forehead is lower according to rectal thermometry - 36. 08 %, while specificity is 95. 18 %. The lowest values of sensitivity are recorded in <b>axillar</b> thermometry (35. 82 %), specificity is 90. 20 %. The correlation coefficient is higher between tympanic and rectal temperature measurement (r= 0. 5076, p< 0. 0005), than between tympanic and forehead measurements (r= 0. 5076, p< 0, 0005), while the lowest was between tympanic and <b>axillar</b> measurement sites (r= 0. 4933, p< 0. 0005). Conclusions The results of our study and literature data show that the most accurate methods of thermometry are rectal measurement of body temperature in small children and tympanic thermometry in children over 2 years of age...|$|E
