5|$|It is {{difficult}} to gain an <b>accurate</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> incidence and prevalence of self-harm. This is due in a part {{to a lack of}} sufficient numbers of dedicated research centres to provide a continuous monitoring system. However, even with sufficient resources, statistical estimates are crude since most incidences of self-harm are undisclosed to the medical profession as acts of self-harm are frequently carried out in secret, and wounds may be superficial and easily treated by the individual. Recorded figures can be based on three sources: psychiatric samples, hospital admissions and general population surveys.|$|E
5|$|Faulty {{intelligence}} was the component that was mostly {{responsible for the}} failure of Adlertag. While the gap between the British and Germans was not yet wide in this regard, the British were starting to gain a decisive lead in intelligence. The breaking of the Enigma machine and poor Luftwaffe signals discipline allowed the British easy access to German communications traffic. The impact of Ultra on the Battle of Britain is a matter of dispute, with Official Histories claiming there was no direct impact. Whatever the truth, Ultra, and the Y service in particular, gave the British an increasingly <b>accurate</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> German order of battle deployments.|$|E
25|$|Gregory wrote over 850 {{letters in}} the last 13 {{years of his life}} (590–604) that give us an <b>accurate</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> his work.

25|$|Commentators {{have argued}} that a {{standard}} methodology is needed to present an <b>accurate</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> performance, to make individual private equity funds comparable and so the asset class as a whole can be matched against public markets {{and other types of}} investment. It is also claimed that PE fund managers manipulate data to present themselves as strong performers, which makes it even more essential to standardize the industry.|$|E
25|$|Evaluating the {{progress}} of conservation programs is difficult, because many sea turtle populations have not been assessed adequately. Most information on sea turtle populations comes from counting nests on beaches, but this doesn’t provide an <b>accurate</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> the whole sea turtle population. A 2010 United States National Research Council report concluded that more detailed information on sea turtles’ life cycles, such as birth rates and mortality, is needed.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} number of stars in the sky, such as Aldebaran, Altair and Deneb, and astronomical terms such as alidade, azimuth, and nadir, are still referred to by their Arabic names. A large corpus of literature from Islamic astronomy remains today, numbering approximately 10,000 manuscripts scattered throughout the world, {{many of which have}} not been read or catalogued. Even so, a reasonably <b>accurate</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> Islamic activity in the field of astronomy can be reconstructed.|$|E

50|$|Polish Intelligence {{produced}} fairly <b>accurate</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> {{the capabilities}} of Poland's main potential adversaries—Germany and the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, this information was of little avail when war came in September 1939. Good intelligence could not offset the overwhelming superiority of the German and Soviet armed forces. The conquest of Poland took four weeks—too short a time for intelligence services to make a significant contribution. With Poland conquered, her intelligence services had to evacuate their headquarters to allied French and British territories.|$|R

Sones subsequently studied video engineering, dye chemistry, and optical image amplification to perfect the procedure. In 1967, Sones's Cleveland Clinic colleague, Dr. René Favaloro, performed the world's first coronary bypass surgery. Dr Favaloro called Sones [...] "the most important contributor to modern cardiology" [...] and said that without his work, [...] "all our efforts in myocardial revascularization would have been fruitless." ...|$|R

A highly exuberant and {{cultural}} festival, this dance form usually comprises a troupe of 6 performers aping {{the movements of the}} majestic, predatory tigers. Their bodies are painted by the painstaking efforts of local artists in vibrant yellow and black to resemble an exact replica of a tiger. The paintings include the ferocious looking fangs and convincing headgear replete with ears paws with claws and long tail that conjures an <b>accurate</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> the savage beast’s graceful movements.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, the Census Bureau {{introduced}} a new supplemental poverty measure aimed at providing a more <b>accurate</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> the true extent of poverty in the United States. The SPM extends the official poverty measure by taking account {{of many of the}} government programs designed to assist low-income families and individuals that are not included in the current official poverty measure. According to this new measure, 16% of Americans lived in poverty in 2011, compared with the official figure of 15.2%. The new measure also estimated that nearly half of all Americans lived in poverty that year, defined as living within 200% of the federal poverty line.|$|E

25|$|In 2003, 1,400 minors {{were arrested}} for prostitution, 14% of whom were younger than 14 years old. A study {{conducted}} by the International Labor Union indicated that boys are at a higher risk of being trafficked into agricultural work, the drug trade, and petty crime. Girls were at a higher risk of being forced into the sex industry and domestic work. In 2004, the Department of Labor found 1,087 minors employed in situations that violated hazardous occupation standards. The same year, 5,480 children were employed violating child labor laws. Due to the secretive nature of trafficking, it is difficult to piece together an <b>accurate</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> how widespread the problem is.|$|E
25|$|According to UN {{estimates}} {{that are not}} based on any household survey access to an improved water source in Lebanon is universal. The UN figures on water access may not give an <b>accurate</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> the real situation: A representative survey {{carried out by the}} World Bank in 2008 estimated that the average connection rate to the public water network was 80%, varying from 96% in Beirut to 55% in the North. These figures are similar to those that came out of a 2004 Household Living Conditions Survey carried out by the Lebanese Central Administration of Statistics. Even considering that improved water sources include protected wells and springs in addition to piped water connections, it is unlikely that water access in Lebanon is universal. For example, many urban households that are not connected to the network rely on water bought from tanker trucks.|$|E

Satellite tracking Argos system, a satellite-based system collects, processes and disseminates {{the data from}} caribou tracking collars, clearly locating exact geographically coordinates. Satellite networks have tracked the migration and territorial movements of caribou. Electronic tags are giving scientists a complete, <b>accurate</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> migration patterns. Using radio transmitters to track one herd of caribou, scientists learned that the herd moves much more than previously thought and they learned that each year the herd returns to about the same place to give birth. Environment Canada uses Landsat satellite imagery, for example, to identify anthropogenic disturbance (human-caused disturbance) to the natural landscape. This includes roads, seismic lines, pipe lines, well sites, and cutblocks that accompany industrial activities such as {{oil and gas exploration}} and development and forestry. British Columbia uses telemetry and computer modelling.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, both {{countries}} regularly deployed satellites. Reconnaissance satellites were used by militaries to take <b>accurate</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> their rivals' military installations. As time passed the resolution and accuracy of orbital reconnaissance alarmed both sides of the iron curtain. Both the United States and the Soviet Union began to develop anti-satellite weapons to blind or destroy each other's satellites. Directed-energy weapons, kamikaze style satellites, as well as orbital nuclear explosion were researched with varying levels of success. Spy satellites were, and continue to be, used to monitor the dismantling of military assets in accordance with arms control treaties signed between the two superpowers. To use spy satellites in such a manner is often referred to in treaties as [...] "national technical means of verification".|$|R
60|$|Passengers on the south-bound {{saw them}} seated together, and {{wondered}} at the conflux of two such antipodes. McGuire was five feet one, with a countenance belonging to either Yokohama or Dublin.

Few <b>accurate</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> his kind have been made, for art galleries are so small and the mutoscope is as yet unknown in Texas. After all, the only possible medium of portrayal of Raidler's kind would be the fresco--something high and simple and cool and unframed.|$|R
25|$|From the Renaissance onwards Jewish Kabbalah texts entered non-Jewish culture, {{where they}} were studied and {{translated}} by Christian Hebraists and Hermetic occultists. The syncretic traditions of Christian Kabbalah and Hermetic Qabalah developed independently of Jewish Kabbalah, reading the Jewish texts as universal ancient wisdom. Both adapted the Jewish concepts freely from their Judaic understanding, to merge with other theologies, religious traditions and magical associations. With the decline of Christian Cabala in the Age of Reason, Hermetic Qabalah continued as a central underground tradition in Western esotericism. Through these non-Jewish associations with magic, alchemy and divination, Kabbalah acquired some popular occult connotations forbidden within Judaism, where Jewish theurgic Practical Kabbalah was a minor, permitted tradition restricted for a few elite. Today, many publications on Kabbalah belong to the non-Jewish New Age and occult traditions of Cabala, rather than giving an <b>accurate</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> Judaic Kabbalah. Instead, academic and traditional publications now translate and study Judaic Kabbalah for wide readership.|$|E

40|$|A {{primary goal}} in biology is to {{understand}} the molecular machinery of the cell. The sequencing projects currently underway provide one view of this machinery. A complementary view is provided by data from DNA microarray hybridization experiments. Synthesizing the information from these disparate types of data requires the development of improved computational techniques.

The two types <b>of</b> data provide <b>accurate</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> overlapping subsets of the gene functional categories present in the cell. Combining the expression data and phylogenetic profiles within a single learning algorithm frequently yields superior classification performance compared to using either data set alone.

Cornell summed up the changes with [...] "What we've lost in sonic precision we've gained so much in terms of feeling." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that Soundgarden [...] "retained their ambitious song structures, neo-psychedelic guitar textures, and winding melodies but haven't dressed them up with detailed production." [...] The songs vary in tempo throughout the course of the album, with Thayil describing the album as having a [...] "dual nature". He stated, [...] "It keeps listeners on their toes and lets them know they're not getting the same album over and over."
