Glenn McCarty of Crosswalk.com said that [...] "As always, Third Day plays to its strength... to craft accessible, {{interesting}} country rock. When it clicks, the result is arm-hair-raising good. Move, unfortunately, doesn't produce that reaction often enough... Move feels a little too safe, or, said another way, a little too static". Lindsay Williams of Gospel Music Channel said that [...] "Move may not be Third Day’s best effort in their large discography, but it’s certainly {{a treasure trove of}} hooky rock. After more than 15 years, this band still has something to say, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> well". John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album four-and-a-half out of five stars, opining [...] "Move showcases some of the best Third Day has to offer. Whether it's better than Revelation or some of their other previous installments (like Wire or Conspiracy No. 5) is something to leave up to the listener to decide, but it does feel safe enough to say that Third Day's Move is a dozen tracks of southern rock goodness". Brian Mansfield of USA Today gave the album two-and-a-half out of four stars, saying [...] "Whether accompanied by sharp-edged electric or slippery resonator guitars, a kids choir or the Blind Boys of Alabama, Third Day's Southern rock remains grounded in the band's faith".|$|E

You dress, eat, drink, walk and talk to yourself to their tune: their inaudible jingle accompanies you all day: you read the sentences of the paper to their rhythm.

6000|$|May 25th, 1744, just while Barberina {{began her}} pirouettings at Berlin, poor Karl Edzard, Prince of East Friesland, long a weak malingering creature, died, rather suddenly; childless, {{and the last}} of his House, which had endured there about 300 years. Our clever Wilhelmina at Baireuth, though readers have {{forgotten}} the small circumstance, had married a superfluous Sister-in-law of hers to this Karl Edward; <b>and,</b> <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> <b>it</b> was some fond hope of progeny, suddenly dashed into nothingness, that finished the poor man, that night of May 25th. In any case, his Territory falls to Prussia, by Reich's Settlement of long standing (1683-1694); which had been confirmed anew to the late King, Friedrich Wilhelm:--we remember how he returned with it, honest man, from that KLADRUP JOURNEY in 1732, and was sniffed at for bringing nothing better. And in the interim, his royal Hanover Cousins, coveting East Friesland, had clapt up an ERBVERBRUDERUNG with the poor Prince there (Father, I think, of the one just dead): [...] "A thing ULTRA VIRES," [...] argued Lawyers; [...] "private, quasi-clandestine; and posterior (in a sense) to Reich's CONCLUSUM, 1694." ...|$|E

There is one thing, if the creed of those Jews of whom Norbanus was speaking to you ever comes to be the dominant religion, there will be an end to the arena, for so averse are these people to fighting, that when placed in the arena they will not make even an effort to defend themselves. They do not, as do the Goths sometimes, lower their swords and fall on the points. Suicide they consider wrong, and simply wait calmly like sheep to be killed. I have been talking with some friends over the persecutions of two years ago, just after I left for Britain, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> was wonderful to see the calmness with which the Christians meet death.

60|$|Aros itself--Aros Jay, I {{have heard}} the natives call it, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>it</b> means the House of God--Aros itself was not {{properly}} {{a piece of the}} Ross, nor was it quite an islet. It formed the south-west corner of the land, fitted close to it, and was in one place only separated from the coast by a little gut of the sea, not forty feet across the narrowest. When the tide was full, this was clear and still, like a pool on a land river; only there was a difference in the weeds and fishes, and the water itself was green instead of brown; but when the tide went out, {{in the bottom of the}} ebb, there was a day or two in every month when you could pass dryshod from Aros to the mainland. There was some good pasture, where my uncle fed the sheep he lived on; perhaps the feed was better because the ground rose higher on the islet than the main level of the Ross, but this I am not skilled enough to settle. The house was a good one for that country, two storeys high. It looked westward over a bay, with a pier hard by for a boat, and from the door you could watch the vapours blowing on Ben Kyaw.|$|E

Henry didn't die right off, but he begun having fits--epileps, they called 'em--and he grew up kind of simple, till he was about eighteen.

At last Henry died and his uncle and aunt give out he died in one of his fits and that was all anybody ever knowed, but everybody said Tom had just up and killed him for keeps at last. And it wasn't long till it got around that Henry WALKED. That old garden was HA'NTED. He was heard there at nights, moaning and crying.
