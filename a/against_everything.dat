25|$|Upton et al. (2002) {{responded to}} Skelton and Memon's paper {{by noting that}} the Review Group on the draft {{resource}} management bill had quite intentionally drafted section 5(2) to emphasise biophysical constraints {{to move away from}} the overly broad and unweighted list of socio-economic and environmental objectives in the Town and Country Planning Act. They concluded;In our view, the plain wording of section 5 is easy enough to understand without recourse to concepts like sustainable development that are not referred to, or the insistence that an anthropogenic reading of the section must necessarily involve weighing up everything <b>against</b> <b>everything</b> else.|$|E
25|$|Described as “a strange person full of acerbity <b>against</b> <b>everything</b> {{and every}} one”, Pigasov {{frequently}} visits Dar’ya Mikhailovna prior to Rudin’s appearance and amuses {{her with his}} bitter remarks, mostly aimed at women. Coming from a poor family, he educated himself, but never rose above the level of mediocrity. He failed his examination in public disputation, in government service {{he made a mistake}} which forced him to retire. His wife later left him and sold her estate, on which he just finished building a house, to a speculator. Since then he lived in the province. He is the first victim of Rudin’s eloquence, as at Rudin’s first appearance he challenged him to a debate and was defeated easily. He ends up living with Lezhnev and Aleksandra Pavlovna.|$|E
25|$|The King {{was unable}} to officially declare a war if the {{decision}} was not fully approved or supported by the Sejm and the Senate. The Sejm usually consisted of around 600 nobles, diplomats and most influential politicians, who met annually at Warsaw or elsewhere, in order to contribute {{as little as possible}} to public needs and protest vehemently <b>against</b> <b>everything</b> they did not like or could not understand. The nobility was also in favour of absolute non-intervention in foreign affairs, as the cheapest and least troublesome policy to pursue. The unwillingness of the Polish gentry to part with their money, especially for armaments, was entirely due to the fear that a popular monarch might curtail their privileges. Rather than run that risk, they avoided every advantageous alliance, forgoing every political opportunity, stinted their armies, starved and abandoned their generals, and even left the territories of the Commonwealth unguarded and undefended. This was the case of Livonia, with its fine seaboard and hundreds of towns and fortresses, which had temporarily fallen into the lap of Poland. It was later retaken by Sweden due to poor organization of the army and disinterest of the nobles to finance any military actions or campaigns. The regular army, on the other hand, was very effective against enemy troops, especially in Polish-occupied Ukraine (Ruthenia), where it had an almost unlimited reserve of the best raw military material. Moreover, the army was led by Zamoyski, Żółkiewski, Chodkiewicz and Stanisław Koniecpolski, four of the greatest generals and military commanders of the age.|$|E

To familiarize himself with the camera, he [...] "did as many things 'wrong' as I possibly could. I went <b>against</b> <b>everything</b> I was supposed to do with the camera."

500|$|Not {{everyone}} in the gay community considered the revolt a positive development. To many older homosexuals and {{many members of the}} Mattachine Society who had worked throughout the 1960s to promote homosexuals as no different from heterosexuals, the display of violence and effeminate behavior was embarrassing. Randy Wicker, who had marched in the first gay picket lines before the White House in 1965, said the [...] "screaming queens forming chorus lines and kicking went <b>against</b> <b>everything</b> that I wanted people to think about homosexuals... that we were a bunch of drag queens in the Village acting disorderly and tacky and cheap."

500|$|In 1955, Hensley {{founded the}} beer distributorship {{that would have}} his name, {{borrowing}} $10,000 <b>against</b> <b>everything</b> he had to buy a small existing distributorship. [...] He was given a state liquor license despite his normally disqualifying past felony conviction. [...] At the start it had 15 workers, sold 73,000 cases of beer a year, and had a 6 percent market share. [...] Hensley soon switched to exclusively distributing Anheuser-Busch beer. [...] Under the early names Hensley & Company Distributors and Hensley & Company Wholesale, the company saw decades of steady growth. It was aided by the Phoenix area {{becoming one of the}} fastest-growing regions of the country while the company maintained its position as Anheuser-Busch's only distributor there. [...] Jim Hensley's tireless sales efforts and the generous wages and benefits he gave employees were also key success factors. [...] By 1980 the business had become quite successful and Jim Hensley was a multi-millionaire. [...] Hensley had also distanced himself from Marley, and had helped set up a local hospital; nevertheless, he was never fully accepted by the Phoenix establishment.|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, when {{psychoanalysis}} was at the height of its influence, its concepts were applied to Hamlet, notably by Sigmund Freud, Ernest Jones, and Jacques Lacan, and these studies influenced theatrical productions. In his The Interpretation of Dreams (1900), Freud's analysis starts from the premise that [...] "the play is built up on Hamlet's hesitations over fulfilling the task of revenge that is assigned to him; but its text offers no reasons or motives for these hesitations". After reviewing various literary theories, Freud concludes that Hamlet has an [...] "Oedipal desire for his mother and the subsequent guilt [...] preventing him from murdering the man [...] who has done what he unconsciously wanted to do". Confronted with his repressed desires, Hamlet realises that [...] "he himself is literally no better than the sinner whom he is to punish". Freud suggests that Hamlet's apparent [...] "distaste for sexuality"—articulated in his [...] "nunnery" [...] conversation with Ophelia—accords with this interpretation. John Barrymore's long-running 1922 performance in New York, directed by Thomas Hopkins, [...] "broke new ground in its Freudian approach to character", in keeping with the post-World War I rebellion <b>against</b> <b>everything</b> Victorian. He had a [...] "blunter intention" [...] than presenting the genteel, sweet prince of 19th-century tradition, imbuing his character with virility and lust.|$|E

2500|$|In the Soviet Union {{the punk}} rock culture {{started in the}} 80's, and was mostly a protest {{movement}} against {{the corruption of the}} regime and the sense there is [...] "no future".

The Soviet punks usually wore boots and coats found in military shops. Also, while in the UK punk was partly a protest against more established rock music genres like progressive rock or glam rock, in the Soviet Union all rock music was in the underground, which made a certain solidarity between punk rock fans and other rock fans in Russia.|$|E
