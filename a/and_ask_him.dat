5|$|Marceau splits {{her time}} between seeing to {{the duties of}} the train (such as helping to fix the heat in the engine), {{interviewing}} passengers about the murder, and examining the train and surrounding area for clues. She travels to several additional locations that Poirot does not travel to in the book, such as the engine, the baggage car, and an old shack outside of the snowed in train. Additionally, a sabotaged ham radio is in one of the compartments which, when repaired, allows Antoinette to contact Poirot's nephew <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to research the passengers.|$|E
5|$|Before announcing UDI to the nation, Smith, Lardner-Burke and the Deputy Prime Minister Clifford Dupont visited Gibbs at Government House {{to inform}} him {{personally}} <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to resign. Gibbs {{made clear that}} he would not do so, but indicated that he would vacate Government House and return to his farm. When Beadle arrived later in the day, he not only persuaded Gibbs to stay at the official residence, but moved in himself to provide advice and moral support. On Beadle's counsel, Gibbs instructed those responsible for law and order in Rhodesia to stay at their posts and carry on as normal. When the Governor showed no sign of stepping down, Smith's government effectively replaced him with Dupont, appointing the latter to the post of Officer Administering the Government created by the 1965 constitution attached to UDI. Lardner-Burke asked Beadle to administer the oath of allegiance to Dupont, but was rebuffed; Beadle said he would be committing a criminal offence if he did so.|$|E

Steph has big plans for her wedding day and it looks as if it’s getting out of control as Jack worries about how much it's going to cost, with Jack even suggesting to Frankie and Steph that he should call Johnno <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to contribute to the cost of the wedding, a suggestion that Steph and Frankie refute immediately on the basis that Johnno was never very good with money, and also that he was now married to Michelle and was therefore preoccupied with bringing up his new son Presley. With only 48 hours until their big day everything starts to go wrong and when Steph accidentally rips her wedding dress it's the final straw. A devastated Steph announces there's no way the wedding can go ahead on Thursday.|$|E
5|$|The {{police are}} upset about Abbott’s death and blame Scully while Doggett reminds them {{that only the}} thing that killed Abbott and the others is to blame. Scully {{explains}} Ariel McKesson died of heart failure and then was burned to cover something up. She realizes that all the victims were people who {{came in contact with}} the body of Ariel McKesson: Abbott investigated the crime, her mother identified the body, the undertaker prepared the body, and Myron Stefaniuk pulled the body from the river. All but Myron Stefaniuk are now dead. Doggett and Scully find Myron <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> about Ernie Stefaniuk, one of the hunters from 1956, who he reveals disappeared a long time ago. The two eventually track down Ernie Stefaniuk, who tells them that he hid on an island {{in the middle of the}} town's lake with his wife, Ariel, for 44 years. Ernie says that the bat creature kills anyone with Ernie’s scent on them, so he had burned his wife’s body to try and cover up the scent. He informs them that it hunts only at night and Myron is in danger. Doggett goes back to find Myron only to be attacked and badly torn up by the creature at the river.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{learns that}} there may be a {{connection}} to a fraternity, and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) informs her that it is the secret society for which he is being recruited, the Castle. Wallace tells her that the equipment used to tape him was similar to that which was used to film Veronica and Piz. He starts to go through initiation with the group in order to ascertain the members' identities for Veronica. The members make him go into a room <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> very personal questions, electrically shocking him if he answers untruthfully. When they find out that Veronica has sent Wallace, they forcibly remove him, but he is able to figure out the identity of one of the other recruits. Veronica sneaks into the house of the recruit Wallace names and sees a large portrait of Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried). She hears voices and hides behind a curtain before two men emerge. They speak about the Castle, and Veronica discovers that one of them is Jake Kane. After they leave, Veronica steals his computers. Keith investigates the robbery the following day, spotting Veronica on surveillance cameras; however, he does not initially report his daughter. Veronica asks Mac (Tina Majorino) whether any computer could crack Jake's password, and she is taken to a supercomputer on campus.|$|E

A strike was threatened by Ford if the other demands were not met, to which Durst responded by immediately terminating Ford and the others on the strike committee who accompanied him. Ford and the strike committee refused to collect their pay and exit the ranch, prompting Durst to call Deputy Sheriff Henry Daken <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to arrest the strike leader. No arrests were made owing {{to the lack of}} an arrest warrant.|$|E

Brian sent a messenger to find Donnchad <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to return with his detachment, but the call for help came too late. To compound Brian's problems, the Norse contingents, led by Sigurd Hlodvirsson, Earl of Orkney and Brodir of the Isle of Man, arrived on Palm Sunday, 18 April. The battle occurred five days later, on Good Friday, 23 April 1014 (898 years before the planned date of the Easter Rising in 1916) {{just north of the}} city of Dublin, at Clontarf.|$|E
25|$|The ace {{race was}} still on; Boelcke {{became the first}} Überkanone with his 10th victory on 12 March; the {{following}} day, even as he scored, Immelmann scored {{one of the first}} double victories of the war to tie it up at 11 all. The dead heat lasted for a week; on 19 March, Boelcke used his usual tactics of pointblank fire to kill the enemy pilot and saw off his Farman's wing with machine gun fire, for win number 12. Immelmann telephoned to congratulate him <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> for an opportunity to catch up; Boelcke jokingly offered him a week's grace. Boelcke's victory two days later may be seen as symptomatic of his disregard for Immelmann.|$|E

In return, the deposed King promises his son to be his witness on his wedding day. In these circumstances, Alexander I agreed to postpone his projected marriage until the restoration of peace. Two days later, Constantine I and his relatives arrived to the small port of Oropos and take the path of exile; it is the last time that Alexander I was in contact with his family.|$|E

25|$|Various anecdotes in Livy's {{history of}} Rome reflect the toga's {{symbolic}} value. In one, the patrician hero Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, retired from public life and clad (presumably) in tunic or loincloth, is ploughing his field when emissaries of the Senate arrive, <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> {{to put on}} his toga. His wife fetches it and he puts it on. Then he is told that he has been appointed dictator. He promptly heads for Rome. Donning the toga transforms Cincinnatus from rustic, sweaty ploughman – though a gentleman nevertheless, of impeccable stock and reputation – into Rome's leading politician, eager to serve his country; a top-quality Roman. Rome's abundant public and private statuary reinforced the notion that all Rome's great men wore togas, and must always have done so.|$|E
25|$|In July 1952, Egypt's pro-Western {{government}} was overthrown by the nationalist Free Officers Movement headed by Gamal Abdel Nasser. Both Qutb and the Muslim Brotherhood welcomed the coup d'état against the monarchist government – which {{they saw as}} un-Islamic and subservient to British imperialism – and enjoyed {{a close relationship with}} the movement prior to and immediately following the coup. Nasser would go the house of Syed Qutb <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> for ideas about the Revolution. Many members of the Brotherhood expected Nasser to establish an Islamic government. However, the co-operation between the Brotherhood and Free Officers which marked the revolution's success soon soured as it became clear the secular nationalist ideology of Nasserism was incompatible with the Islamism of the Brotherhood.|$|E
25|$|Syed Qutb from a {{young age}} would save up his money for a man called Amsaalih, who used to sell books around the local villages. He would have a big {{collection}} of books, and another small collection specifically for Syed Qutb. If Syed never had the money, he would tell him that I don't have the money now, so let me borrow it and I'll give it you next time you come around. And Amsaalih would let him do that. At the age of 12, {{he had his own}} library collection of 25 books, even though books were really expensive during that time. He would imitate the scholars by reading the books, and then give lectures {{to the rest of the}} village. If any women needed any information, they would wait till Syed Qutb came back from school, <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to share the knowledge he had to them. In many occasions he would be shy because he was a young man, but in some occasions he would go and teach the knowledge he had to the people who asked him.|$|E

25|$|On July 19, 1810, the {{precursors}} {{of the independence}} - Camilo Torres Tenorio, José Acevedo Gómez, José Miguel Pey and Jorge Tadeo Lozano, among others - held a secret meeting in the Astronomic Observatory of Bogotá, the office of Francisco José de Caldas. They had been informed of a plan by the Spaniards to arrest prominent criollos who had ideas of independence; {{the precursors}} were determined to win their independence and they, that night, planned the revolution. They were also convinced that the upcoming visit of the Regency Commissioners, Antonio Villavicencio and Carlos Montúfar, would bring the same results it had in Cartagena de Indias. Camilo Torres proposed that the first strike had {{to come from the}} Spaniards, to incite the people for an uprising and to prevent their supporters from doing something about it. Camacho would go to the house of the viceroy <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to allow a Junta to take place: they knew {{that he was going to}} oppose this, but would use it as the Spaniards' way of undermining the American people. Meanwhile, Luis de Rubio and Antonio Morales would go to the house of José Gonzales Llorente and start a mob uprising with the excuse of borrowing a flower vase, something they knew he would refuse giving Llorente's reputation.|$|E
25|$|The Cerro de la Bufa is {{very close}} to the city of Guanajuato and has a number of stories {{associated}} with it. At sunset, there is a formation that looks like the profile of the face of a bearded man. According to tradition, this is the face of Christ. There are two caves consecrated to Ignatius of Loyola. There are {{on opposite sides of the}} summit and called the “old” and “new” cave. Each 31 of July, there is a pilgrimage to the “new” cave in honor of the saint. Sometime during the colonial period, an image of Ignatius was painted on a wall. According to legend, a group of male witches used to use the cave for their rites on the eve before the Catholic ritual, “forcing” the image on the wall to observe. The Cerro de la Bufa is home to another legend about an enchanted princess. It states that on feast days, a woman would appear to a man on a road in the mountain <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to carry her to the Basilica in the city center in his arms. If he did so, the city of Guanajuato would return to the height of its wealth. If he chose to do so, noises and threats from behind would haunt him. If he lost his resolve, the woman would turn into a serpent and kill him. No woman has ever been carried from this mountain to the Basilica.|$|E
25|$|Karadžić was {{fortunate}} to be a relative of Jevta Savić Čotrić, the only literate person in the area at the time, who {{taught him how to}} read and write. Karadžić continued his education in the Tronoša Monastery in Loznica. As a boy he learned calligraphy there, using a reed instead of a pen and a solution of gunpowder for ink. In lieu of proper writing paper he was lucky if he could get cartridge wrappings. Throughout the whole region, regular schooling was not widespread at that time and his father at first did not allow him to go to Austria. Since most of the time while in the monastery Karadžić was forced to pasture the livestock instead of studying, his father brought him back home. Meanwhile, the First Serbian Uprising seeking to overthrow the Ottomans began in 1804. After unsuccessful attempts to enroll in the gymnasium at Sremski Karlovci, for which 19-year-old Karadžić was too old, Karadžić left for Petrinja where he spent a few months learning Latin and German. Later on, he left for Belgrade, {{now in the hands of}} the Revolutionary Serbia, in order to meet the highly respected scholar Dositej Obradović, <b>and</b> <b>ask</b> <b>him</b> to support his studies. Unfortunately, Obradović dismissed him. Disappointed, Karadžić left for Jadar and began working as a scribe for Jakov Nenadović. After the founding of the Belgrade Higher School, Karadžić became one of its first students.|$|E
