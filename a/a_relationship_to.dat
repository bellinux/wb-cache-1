5|$|Austrian naturalist Franz Xaver von Wulfen {{described}} the false chanterelle in 1781, noting both its resemblance with the true chanterelles and people's propensity to confuse them. The false chanterelle was then {{placed in the}} genus Clitocybe, but it was later observed that its forked gills and dextrinoid spores indicated <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> Paxillus. Genetic analysis has confirmed that {{it belongs to the}} order Boletales and is more closely related to boletes.|$|E
5|$|The raphines are {{sometimes}} separated {{as a distinct}} family Raphidae, and their affinities were for long uncertain. They were initially placed in the ratites due to their peculiar, flightlessness-related apomorphies, and <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> the Rallidae has also been suggested. Osteological and molecular data, however, agrees that placement in the Columbidae is more appropriate. Many different affinities have historically been suggested for the dodo, including {{that it was a}} small ostrich, a rail, an albatross, or a vulture.|$|E
5|$|The {{boys and}} the backpackers visit a water park, where Jay intends to find his ex-girlfriend, Jane. The park staff tell Jay that Jane has found a new job in the vast Outback, which leaves Jay feeling very dejected. Lucy tells Simon via Skype that Jane {{is working on a}} stud farm in the remote {{settlement}} of Birdsville, and the boys intend to drive there. Their car runs out of petrol {{in the middle of the}} desert. The group hold hands together as they realise that they will most likely die, but are rescued by Jane and her co-workers. She realises how far Jay came to win her over again, and although she is touched by the gesture, she does not take him back. Back at Jay's uncle's house, the boys find that their parents have travelled to find them after hearing of their near-death experience. The boys are shocked to find Mr Gilbert (their old head of sixth form and Will's nemesis) there too, and Will's mother announces that she and Gilbert are in <b>a</b> <b>relationship,</b> <b>to</b> the abject horror of Will and amusement of the other three friends. Over Skype, Lucy breaks-up with Simon because she is now in a relationship with his university 'best friend' Pete, which Simon responds to by cheering and abruptly hanging-up on her.|$|E

30|$|Recent {{research}} into commitment {{has focused on}} investigating different targets of commitment within the organization. Commitment has been conceptualized <b>to</b> study <b>a</b> person’s <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> another person in a social exchange (Cook and Emerson 1978), <b>a</b> person’s <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> group (Ellemers et al. 1997, Cropanzano and Mitchell 2005), <b>a</b> person’s <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> organization (Allen and Meyer 1990, Tzafrir and Enosh 2011), or person’s <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> his/her supervisor (Stinglhamber and Vandenberghe 2003). Commitment to the supervisor has been studied as a factor that motivates citizenship behaviours (Redman and Snape 2005) or reduce employee turnover (Maertz et al. 2007).|$|R

50|$|Marx and Engels {{typically}} use {{the term}} to refer <b>to</b> the socioeconomic <b>relationships</b> characteristic of <b>a</b> specific epoch; for example: <b>a</b> capitalist's exclusive <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> capital good, and a wage worker's consequent relation to the capitalist; <b>a</b> feudal lord's <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fief, and the serf's consequent relation to the lord; <b>a</b> slavemaster's <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> their slave; etc. It is contrasted with and also affected by what Marx called the forces of production.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to {{communicating with the}} spirits {{of people who have}} <b>a</b> personal <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> congregants, some Spiritual Churches also deal with spirits who may have <b>a</b> specific <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> the medium or <b>a</b> historic <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> the body of the church. An example of the latter is the spirit of Black Hawk, a Native American warrior of the Fox tribe who lived during the 19th century. Black Hawk was a spirit who was often contacted by the Spiritualist medium Leafy Anderson and he remains the central focus of special services in the African American Spiritual Churches that she founded.|$|R

25|$|Also {{known in}} the sources as Medullia, its exact {{location}} is unknown. It was the hometown of Hostus Hostilius's family and was conquered by Tullus Hostilius, although not destroyed. Its name suggests <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> the Ligurian tribe of the Medulli (Medylloi in Strabon IV 1, 11) and {{would appear to be}} cognate with the Celtic deity Meduna. Strabo mentions two other towns named Medullia, one on the western alps in Gallia and one on the eastern alps in Iapudia.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{communication}} with an audience became a big thing {{for me at the}} time. The reason I was using that concept so much at that point in my life – in 1968, 1969 or so – was because it was a discovery for me. I grew up kind of only thinking how much fun it was to tinkle on the piano and not noticing that what I did had an effect on others. I did not even think about <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> an audience, really, until way later.|$|E
25|$|In particular, Japan's largest male talent agency, Johnny & Associates Entertainment Company, specializes only in {{producing}} male Tarento idols. Accepted into Johnny & Associates {{in their early}} teens, these boys, collectively known as 'Johnnys', are trained and promoted {{to become the next}} leading singing-acting-commercially successful hit sensations. Almost all can be classified as bishōnen, exhibiting the same physically feminine features combined with a sometimes deliberately ambivalent sexuality or at the very least, a lack of any hint of <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> maintain their popular availability.|$|E

25|$|A Vermeer {{painting}} plays a {{key part}} of the dénouement in Agatha Christie's After the Funeral (1953). Susan Vreeland's novel Girl in Hyacinth Blue follows eight individuals with <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> a painting of Vermeer. The young adult novel Chasing Vermeer by Blue Balliett centers around the fictional theft of Vermeer's A Lady Writing. J. P. Smith's novel The Discovery of Light deals largely with Vermeer. The character of Barney in Thomas Harris's novel Hannibal (1999) has a goal to see every Vermeer painting in the world before he dies.|$|E
25|$|Educational {{psychology}} can in part {{be understood}} through {{its relationship with}} other disciplines. It is informed primarily by psychology, bearing <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> that discipline analogous {{to the relationship between}} medicine and biology. It is also informed by neuroscience. Educational psychology in turn informs a wide range of specialities within educational studies, including instructional design, educational technology, curriculum development, organizational learning, special education, classroom management, and student motivation. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to cognitive science and the learning sciences. In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks.|$|E
25|$|Kamen Rider Black premiered in 1987, {{the first}} series not hinting at <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> its predecessors. Black {{was the first}} show in the {{franchise}} with a direct sequel: Kamen Rider Black RX, the basis of Saban's Americanized Masked Rider. In RX finale, the ten previous Riders returned to help Black RX defeat the Crisis Empire. Kamen Rider Black RX was the final show produced during the Shōwa era, with the franchise resuming production {{by the end of}} the 20th century. A manga of Kamen Rider Black was a novelization and reimagination of the Black-RX series' continuity. Absent from television during the 1990s, the franchise was kept alive by stage shows, musical CDs, and the , ZO, and J films.|$|E

25|$|Whether or not {{non-ionizing}} radiation causes leukemia {{has been studied}} for several decades. The International Agency for Research on Cancer expert working group undertook a detailed review of all data on static and extremely low frequency electromagnetic energy, which occurs naturally and {{in association with the}} generation, transmission, and use of electrical power. They concluded that there is limited evidence that high levels of ELF magnetic (but not electric) fields might cause some cases of childhood leukemia. No evidence for <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> leukemia or another form of malignancy in adults has been demonstrated. Since exposure to such levels of ELFs is relatively uncommon, the World Health Organization concludes that ELF exposure, if later proven to be causative, would account for just 100 to 2400 cases worldwide each year, representing 0.2 to 4.9% of the total incidence of childhood leukemia for that year (about 0.03 to 0.9% of all leukemias).|$|E

25|$|Campbell and Foster (2007) {{argue that}} self-regulatory {{strategies}} are {{of paramount importance}} to understanding narcissism. Self-regulation in narcissists involves such things as striving to make one's self look and feel positive, special, successful and important. It comes in both intra-psychic, such as blaming a situation rather than self for failure, and interpersonal forms, such as using <b>a</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>to</b> serve one's own self. Some differences in self-regulation between narcissists and non-narcissists can be seen with Campbell, Reeder, Sedikides & Elliot (2000) who conducted a study with two experiments. In each experiment, participants took part in an achievement task, following which they were provided with false feedback; it was either bogus success or failure. The study found that both narcissists and non-narcissists self-enhanced, but non-narcissists showed more flexibility in doing so. Participants were measured on both a comparative and a non-comparative self-enhancement strategy. Both narcissists and non-narcissists employed the non-comparative strategy similarly; however, narcissists {{were found to be}} more self-serving with the comparative strategy, employing it far more than non-narcissists, suggesting a greater rigidity in their self-enhancement. When narcissists receive negative feedback that threatens the self, they self-enhance at all costs, but non-narcissists tend to have limits.|$|E
