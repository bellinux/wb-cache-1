50|$|An <b>aunt</b> <b>is</b> {{a person}} who is the sister, half-sister, step-sister, or {{sister-in-law}} of a parent, but can also be an affectionate title for an older nurturing lady. <b>Aunts</b> <b>are</b> second-degree relatives and share 25% genetic overlap when they are the full sister of the parent. A half-aunt is a half-sister of one's parent and is a third-degree relative with 12.5% genetic overlap. If the <b>aunt</b> <b>is</b> a step-sister or sister-in-law, direct genetic overlap will typically be 0%, as this person entered the family through marriage and typically is not a blood relative.|$|R

5|$|In December 1895, {{two months}} after the French capture of Antananarivo, popular {{resistance}} to French rule emerged {{in the form of the}} menalamba ("red shawl") rebellion. This guerrilla war against foreigners, Christianity and political corruption quickly spread throughout the island and was principally conducted by peasants who wore shawls smeared with the red laterite soil of the highlands. The resistance movement gained ground until it was effectively put down by the French military at the end of 1897. Members of Ranavalona's court were accused of encouraging the rebels and many leading figures were executed, including the queen's uncle Ratsimamanga (brother of her favored adviser, Ramisindrazana) and her minister of war, Rainandriamampandry. Ramisindrazana, the queen's <b>aunt,</b> <b>was</b> exiled to Réunion, as the French were reluctant to execute a woman.|$|E

25|$|After {{finishing}} {{high school}} which ended at Grade 11, Muriel attended the Ontario Ladies College, a Methodist girls' school in Whitby, Ontario. Her aunt, Abbie Ball, taught there {{and offered to}} pay Muriel's fees. The College provided instruction in languages, history, mathematics and piano but little science. The 15-year-old Muriel was too shy to participate in drama even though her <b>aunt</b> <b>was</b> the school's drama coach. She also suffered from homesickness. Once a month, guest speakers, usually from the United Church of Canada addressed the student assembly.

25|$|Changmarín {{was born}} in Santiago de Veraguas, Panama, being the second son of an out-of-wedlock union between Carlos Chang, a rich, Chinese-Panamanian merchant, and Faustina Marin, a campesina. He grew up among his mother's family, being unable to be {{acknowledged}} in public by his father under the conservative values of Panama's countryside of the early 1920s. However, later his father decided to take him from his mother {{when he was still}} a child and sent him to live with a paternal aunt. His <b>aunt</b> <b>was</b> brutally abusive, treating him basically as a slave, constantly humiliating his mixed heritage and his mother's social status. The father, although not participating in the abuse, provided no protection from it and even promoted this behavior in some cases.|$|E
25|$|Realizing {{that the}} 17th Street Elementary school {{provided}} better books and educational benefits, Mendez {{and her husband}} Gonzalo, decided {{that they would like}} to have their children and nephews enrolled in there. Thus, in 1943, when her daughter Sylvia Mendez was only eight years old, she accompanied her aunt Sally Vidaurri, her brothers and cousins to enroll at the 17th Street Elementary School. Her <b>aunt</b> <b>was</b> told by school officials that her children, who had light skin, would be permitted to enroll - but that neither Sylvia Mendez nor her brothers would be allowed because they were dark-skinned and had a Hispanic surname.

25|$|Born {{sometime}} between the years AD 50 and AD 55, Domitia Longina {{was the second}} daughter of Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo and Cassia Longina. Her maternal grandmother was Junia Lepida, a great-great-granddaughter of Augustus, the first Roman emperor {{and founder of the}} Julio-Claudian dynasty. Her paternal <b>aunt</b> <b>was</b> the Roman empress Milonia Caesonia, wife of Caligula and mother to Julia Drusilla. Her elder sister, also named Domitia married the senator Lucius Annius Vinicianus. Their father, Corbulo was one of Rome's most esteemed citizens, both in the Roman Senate and the army. In addition to serving as consul under Caligula, he conducted military campaigns in Germania and Parthia under Claudius and Nero, respectively. However, his family was connected to the failed Pisonian conspiracy against Nero in AD 65, consequently leading to Corbulo's disgrace and suicide.|$|E
25|$|Sir Leslie Stephen's {{eminence}} as an editor, critic, and biographer, and {{his connection}} to William Thackeray, meant that his children {{were raised in}} an environment filled with the influences of Victorian literary society. Henry James, George Henry Lewes, and Virginia's honorary godfather, James Russell Lowell, were among the visitors to the house. Julia Stephen was equally well connected. Her <b>aunt</b> <b>was</b> a pioneering early photographer Julia Margaret Cameron {{who was also a}} visitor to the Stephen household. Supplementing these influences was the immense library at the Stephens' house, from which Virginia and Vanessa were taught the classics and English literature. As was all-too common in this era, their brothers Adrian and Julian (Thoby) were formally educated and sent to Cambridge, a disparity that Virginia noted and condemned in her writing. The sisters did, however, benefit indirectly from their brothers' Cambridge contacts, as the boys brought their new intellectual friends home to the Stephens' drawing room.|$|E
25|$|Charles's {{victory at}} the Battle of Pavia (1525) {{surprised}} many Italians and Germans and elicited concerns that Charles would endeavor to gain even greater power. Pope Clement VII switched sides and now joined forces with France and prominent Italian states against the Habsburg Emperor, in the War of the League of Cognac. In 1527, due to Charles' inability to pay them sufficiently, his armies in Northern Italy mutinied and sacked Rome itself for loot, forcing Clement, and succeeding popes, to be considerably more prudent in their dealings with secular authorities: in 1533, Clement's refusal to annul Henry VIII of England's marriage to Catherine of Aragon (Charles' <b>aunt)</b> <b>was</b> {{a direct consequence of}} his unwillingness to offend the emperor and perhaps have his capital sacked a second time. The Peace of Barcelona, signed between Charles and the pope in 1529, established a more cordial relationship between the two leaders that effectively named Spain as the protector of the Catholic cause and recognized Charles as king of Lombardy in return for Spanish intervention in overthrowing the rebellious Florentine Republic.|$|E
