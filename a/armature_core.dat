40|$|Abstract — The {{induction}} planar actuator, i. e. IPA, {{proposed in}} this study presents an electromagnetic structure formed by a static ferromagnetic core with an aluminium plate that corresponds to the secondary, and a mover, also called primary. The latter comprehends two three-phase windings, mounted in an <b>armature</b> <b>core,</b> which are orthogonal to each other. When they are fed by three-phase AC excitations, a moving magnetic field takes place, and can travel along the x-axis and the y-axis direction simultaneously. The travelling magnetic field induces electrical currents in the secondary. The interaction between the moving magnetic field from the primary and the magnetic field originated by the induced current in the secondary produces a planar force. That explains the primary movement over the working area defined by the secondary. The 3 D flux density distribution of the actuator suggests the employment of a grain-insulated soft magnetic composite to reduce eddy currents and losses on {{the core of the}} primary <b>armature</b> <b>core.</b> Magnetic flux density, induced current and planar traction forces are studied.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} peak {{armature}} and peak field winding currents for three different topologies of 10 MW partial High Temperature Superconducting Generators (HTSGs) under Short-Circuit Conditions (SCC) by simulation.

40|$|The {{stationary}} discontinuous armatures {{that are}} used in permanent magnet linear synchronous motors (PM-LSMs) have been proposed as a driving source for transportation systems. However, the stationary discontinu-ous armature PM-LSM contains the outlet edges which always exist {{as a result of the}} discontinuous arrange-ment of the armature. For this reason, the high alteration of the outlet edge cogging force produced between the <b>armature’s</b> <b>core</b> and the mover’s permanent magnet when a mover passes the boundary between the arma-ture’s installation part and non-installation part has been indicated as a problem. Therefore, we have exam-ined the outlet edge cogging force by installing the auxiliary teeth at the armature’s outlet edge in order to minimize the outlet edge cogging force generated when the armature is arranged discontinuously. Moreover, we obtained the calculation by analyzing the shape of the auxiliary teeth in which the outlet edge cogging force is minimized the most...|$|R

The new structure, at 38 A resolution, shows a marked resemblance to the structure determined for the E. coli 70 S ribosome (Frank, J., A. Verschoor, Y. Li, J. Zhu, R. K. Lata, M. Radermacher, P. Penczek, R. Grassucci, R. K. Agrawal, and Srivastava. 1996 b. In press; Frank, J., J. Zhu, P. Penczek, Y. Li, S. Srivastava., A. Verschoor, M. Radermacher, R. Grassucci, R. K. Lata, and R. Agrawal. 1995. Nature (Lond.). 376 : 441 - 444.) limited to a comparable resolution, but {{with a number of}} eukaryotic elaborations superimposed. Although considerably greater size and intricacy of the features is seen in the morphology of the large subunit (60 S vs 50 S), the most striking differences are in the small subunit morphology (40 S vs 30 S) : the extended beak and crest features of the head, the back lobes, and the feet. However, the structure underlying these extra features appears to be remarkably similar in form to the 30 S portion of the 70 S structure. The intersubunit space also appears to be strongly conserved, as might be expected from the degree of functional conservation of the ribosome among kingdoms (Eukarya, Eubacteria, and Archaea). The internal organization of the 80 S structure appears as an <b>armature</b> or <b>core</b> of high-density material for each subunit, with the two cores linked by a single bridge between the platform region of the 40 S subunit and the region below the presumed peptidyltransferase center of the 60 S subunit.

However, conventional single-sided linear motors have serious engineering problems.

40|$|Permanent magnet linear motors (PMLMs) with double-layer {{concentrated}} windings generally show significant cogging forces due to {{the introduction}} of auxiliary teeth for eliminating the end-effect induced phase unbalance, even when the fractional-slot technology is applied. This paper presents a novel approach to reduce the cogging force by adjusting the <b>armature</b> <b>core</b> dimensions in fractional-slot PMLMs with double-layer concentrated windings, together with magnet skewing. It is shown that the proposed technique is capable of reducing the cogging force of the motor in an effective way, with the peak value minimized to less than 0. 4 % of the rated thrust force in the case study. Such a technique can also be applicable to other linear motors with appropriate changes...|$|E

However, these actuators can suffer from large cogging forces, {{which have a}} destabilizing effect on the servo control system and compromise position and speed control accuracy.

This gives that the contribution of the stator teeth and finite length of the ferromagnetic <b>armature</b> <b>core</b> to the total cogging force can be separately analyzed.
