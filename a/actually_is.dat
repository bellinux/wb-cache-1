5|$|A mutant who can freeze {{objects and}} create ice. His family is unaware {{that he is}} a mutant and simply {{believes}} he is at a boarding school. After returning home, Bobby reveals to them what he <b>actually</b> <b>is,</b> much to his brother's derision. He is also Rogue's boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|Callie {{then goes}} on to date Penny, who was the {{resident}} in charge of Derek Shepard's case. She comes to a dinner party hosted by Meredith, who recognizes her. It is then discovered that Penny is going to be working at Grey Sloan Memorial. When everyone, including Callie, finds out who Penny <b>actually</b> <b>is,</b> they protest and try to get her off of the Grey Sloan Memorial residency line. She manages to stay on the line despite all the other's pleads and wishes.|$|E
5|$|Briam tells Kamala {{to stay in}} her quarters, but Captain Picard {{allows her}} to travel {{throughout}} the ship, with the unaffected Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) as her escort. This results in a fight nearly breaking out in Ten Forward, when Kamala begins to interact with several miners. The Ferengi seek to bribe Briam to turn Kamala over to them, but he rejects their offer. As he leaves, they attack him, causing him to fall, hit his head, and lose consciousness. The Enterprise turns the Ferengi over to the nearest starbase to stand trial, but Briam is unable {{to participate in the}} ceremony. Kamala helps Picard to take on Briam's role, and the two become close. He seeks to resist her abilities and tells her to be herself, and she explains that the woman he wants her to be is who she <b>actually</b> <b>is.</b>|$|E
25|$|The French {{mathematician}} Paul Lévy {{proved the}} following theorem, which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a continuous Rn-valued stochastic process X to <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> n-dimensional Brownian motion. Hence, Lévy's condition can <b>actually</b> <b>be</b> {{used as an}} alternative definition of Brownian motion.|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{anomalous}} {{electron configuration}} for gaseous thorium atoms, metallic thorium shows significant 5f involvement. This was first realised in 1995, {{when it was}} pointed out that a hypothetical metallic state of thorium that had the 6d27s2 configuration with the 5f orbitals above the Fermi level should be hexagonal close packed like the group 4 elements titanium, zirconium, and hafnium, and not face-centred cubic as it <b>actually</b> <b>is.</b> The actual crystal structure can only be explained when the 5f states are invoked, proving that thorium, and not protactinium, acts as the first actinide metallurgically. The 5f character of thorium is also clear in the rare and highly unstable +3 oxidation state, in which thorium exhibits the electron configuration 5f1.|$|E
5|$|Eta Carinae A is not {{a typical}} LBV. It is more {{luminous}} than any other LBV in the Milky Way although possibly comparable to other supernova impostors detected in external galaxies. It does not currently lie on the S Doradus instability strip, although {{it is unclear what}} the temperature or spectral type of the underlying star <b>actually</b> <b>is,</b> and during its Great Eruption it was much cooler than a typical LBV outburst. The 1890 eruption may have been fairly typical of LBV eruptions, with an early F spectral type, and {{it has been estimated that}} the star may currently have an opaque stellar wind forming a pseudo-photosphere with a temperature of 9,000 K–14,000 K which would be typical for an LBV in eruption.|$|E
5|$|GRO J0422+32 (V518 Persei) {{is another}} X-ray binary in Perseus. One {{component}} {{is a red}} dwarf star of spectral type M4.5V, which orbits a mysterious dense and heavy object—possibly a black hole—every 5.1 hours. The system is an X-ray nova, meaning that it experiences periodic outbursts in the X-ray band of the electromagnetic spectrum. If the system does indeed contain a black hole, {{it would be the}} smallest one ever recorded. Further analysis in 2012 calculated a mass of 2.1 solar masses, which raises questions as to what the object <b>actually</b> <b>is</b> as it appears to be too small to be a black hole.|$|E

5|$|Several {{geographic}} {{features are}} named after Patrick Cleburne, including Cleburne County in Alabama and Arkansas, {{and the city}} of Cleburne, Texas. The location where he was killed in Franklin, Tennessee was reclaimed by preservationists and is now known as Cleburne Park. Though the small monument in the park is often perceived as a monument to Cleburne, it <b>actually</b> <b>is</b> a marker to show where The Carter Family Cotton Gin once stood (the gin being {{an integral part of the}} Battle of Franklin, and The Carter House itself being the headquarters of Union Brigadier General Jacob D. Cox).|$|E
5|$|The {{day of the}} bris arrives, and Kyle is {{grounded}} for sending Ike away. When the mohel arrives to perform the bris, Ike flees to Kyle's room in terror. Seeing Ike in distress and some old pictures prompts {{a change of heart}} in Kyle, and he defends his brother fiercely before it is explained to him what a circumcision <b>actually</b> <b>is,</b> at which point Stan and Cartman decide they want to be circumcised too. They watch the process; even though the boys pass out momentarily, Kyle is relieved to see Ike unharmed.|$|E
5|$|The latter mode <b>actually</b> <b>is</b> {{reserved}} {{specifically for}} solo agung contest. Unlike other Southern Filipino groups {{who participate in}} group contest, the Maguindanao are unique in that they also hold solo agung contest {{to find out who}} in the community is the best papagagung (expert agung player). Tidto is prefect for such contest since the agung is often the focus of attention, the focal point during the ensemble during this mode. Players normally perform two or more versions playing the three types of techniques discussed above.|$|E

5|$|The story centres {{on a young}} engaged couple whose car {{breaks down}} in the rain near a castle where they seek a {{telephone}} to call for help. The castle or country home is occupied by strangers in elaborate costumes celebrating an annual convention. They discover {{the head of the}} house is Dr. Frank N. Furter, an apparent mad scientist who <b>actually</b> <b>is</b> an alien transvestite who creates a living muscle man in his laboratory. The couple are seduced separately by the mad scientist and eventually released by the servants who take control.|$|E
5|$|Vulcanoids, {{being an}} entirely new class of {{celestial}} bodies, would be interesting in their own right, but discovering {{whether or not they}} exist would yield insights into the formation and evolution of the Solar System. If they exist they might contain material left over from the earliest period of planet formation, and help determine the conditions under which the terrestrial planets, particularly Mercury, formed. In particular, if vulcanoids exist or did exist in the past, they would represent an additional population of impactors that have affected no other planet but Mercury, making that planet's surface appear older than it <b>actually</b> <b>is.</b> If vulcanoids are found not to exist, this would place different constraints on planet formation and suggest that other processes have been at work in the inner Solar System, such as planetary migration clearing out the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossil record}} of the {{albatrosses}} in the Northern Hemisphere is more complete {{than that of the}} southern, and many fossil forms of albatross have been found in the North Atlantic, which today has no albatrosses. The remains of a colony of short-tailed albatrosses have been uncovered on the island of Bermuda, and the majority of fossil albatrosses from the North Atlantic have been of the genus Phoebastria (the North Pacific albatrosses); one, Phoebastria anglica, has been found in deposits in both North Carolina and England. Due to convergent evolution in particular of the leg and foot bones, remains of the prehistoric pseudotooth birds (Pelagornithidae) may be mistaken for those of extinct albatrosses; Manu may be such a case, and quite certainly the supposed giant albatross femur from the Early Pleistocene Dainichi Formation at Kakegawa, Japan, <b>actually</b> <b>is</b> from one of the last pseudotooth birds. For more data on fossil species of the living albatross genera, see the genus articles.|$|E
