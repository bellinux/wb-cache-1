25|$|While {{the quality}} of free, public {{education}} is in crisis, {{a majority of the}} urban poor have turned to private schools. In some urban cities, it is estimated as high as two-thirds of all students attend private institutions, many of which charge a modest US$2 per month. There has not been any standardised <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> private schools perform, but it is generally accepted that they outperform public schools.|$|E

2500|$|The {{more that}} is known about Bronze Age history, the clearer it becomes {{that it is not}} a yes-or-no {{question}} but one of educated <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> much historical knowledge is present in Homer, and whether it represents a retrospective memory of Dark Age Greece, as Finley concludes, or of Mycenaean Greece, which is the dominant view of A Companion to Homer, A.J.B. Wace and F.H. Stebbings, eds. (New York/London: Macmillan 1962). The particular narrative [...] of the Iliad is not an account of the war, but a tale of the psychology, the wrath, vengeance and death of individual heroes, which assumes common knowledge of the Trojan War as a back-story. No scholars now assume that the individual events of the tale (many of which involve divine intervention) are historical fact; however, no scholars claim that the story is entirely devoid of memories of Mycenaean times.|$|E
