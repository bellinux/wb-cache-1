40|$|We {{have used}} {{correlative}} analysis between mean December-January-February winter wind velocities, {{measured at the}} Xisha Meteorological Observatory (16 degrees 50 'N, 112 degrees 20 'E) {{in the middle of}} the South China Sea, and mean 518 0 data for the corresponding month from Porites lutea coral, collected in Longwan waters (19 degrees 20 'N, 110 degrees 39 'E), to obtain a linear equation relating the two datasets. This winter wind velocity for the South China Sea (WMIIscs) can then be correlated to the coral delta(18) O by the equation WMIIscs = - 1. 213 - 1. 351 delta(18) O (parts per thousand PDB), r = - 0. 60, n = 40, P = 0. 01. From this, the calculated WMIIscs-delta 18 O series from 1944 to 1997 tends to decrease during the 1940 s to the 1960 s; it increases slightly during the 1970 s and then decreases again in the 1980 s and 1990 s. The calculated decadal mean WMIIscs-delta 18 O series had a obvious decrease from 5. 92 to 4. 63 m/s during the period of 1944 - 1997. The calculated yearly mean WMIIscs-delta 18 O value is 5. 58 m/s from 1944 to 1976 and this decreases to 4. 85 m/s from 1977 to 1998. That is the opposite trend to the observed yearly mean SST variation. The yearly mean SST anomaly is - 0. 27 degrees from 1943 to 1976 and this increases to + 0. 16 degrees from 1977 to 1998. Spectral analysis used on a 54 -year-long calculated WMIIscs-delta 18 O series produces spectral peaks at 2. 4 - 7 yr, which can be closely correlated with the quasibiennial oscillation band (QBO band, 2 - 2. 4 yr) and the El Nino southern oscillation band (ENSO band, 3 - 8 yr). Hence most of the variability of the winter monsoon intensity {{in the middle of the}} South China Sea is mainly constrained by changes in the thermal difference between the land and the <b>adjoining</b> <b>sea</b> <b>area,</b> perhaps due to global warming.

40|$|The first {{assessment}} of abundance {{of a local}} population of bottlenose dolphins in the Black Sea (near the Sudak coast) in 2011 – 2012 has been conducted: {{the results of a}} mark-recapture study of photo identified animals were complemented by a vessel line transect survey. The overall abundance of a population was estimated at between 621 ± 198 and 715 ± 267 animals (Chapman and Petersen estimates), and the majority of members of the population were recorded in the surveyed area. The summer range covered the area of a few hundred square kilometers, similar to migrating coastal stocks in other world regions. The greatest density of distribution was observed in August in sea 45 – 60 m deep; in addition, frequent approaches to the coastline are usual for dolphins of this stock. These trends in distribution may be partly explained by distribution of prey. Interaction with sprat trawling fisheries can be a factor shaping the local population structure. Coastal waters of Sudak and <b>adjoining</b> <b>sea</b> <b>areas</b> are an important habitat for bottlenose dolphins in the northern Black Sea, significant for their conservation...|$|R
