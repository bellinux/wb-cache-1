5|$|As {{it moved}} northward, Jeanne {{continued}} to drop moderate to heavy rainfall, including over 7inches (175mm) in southern Georgia.

40|$|While {{regional}} disparities {{in the overall}} rate of participation in {{further education and training}} among young people are relatively small, marked differences persist in the pattern of investment <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>regions.</b> <b>The</b> proportion of young people continuing in full-time further education in <b>the</b> northern <b>regions</b> continues to lag far behind that in the south. This paper analyses the sources of this 'north-south' divide and the role played by differences in the educational and socio-economic composition of <b>the</b> <b>regions.</b> <b>The</b> results indicate that differences in schooling and levels of educational attainment play a modest role in determining such {{regional disparities}}. Further, eliminating all compositional differences <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>regions</b> - {{not only in terms of}} educational attainment, but also social and ethnic background and local labour market factors - would leave a significant north-south gap in participation in further education. These results point to continuing differences in underlying attitudes to further education and training, and these appear to be particularly marked among young women. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{dramatic}} increase in the returns to college during the 1980 s triggered a vast literature aimed at explaining the evolution of the college wage premium. A simple supply-demand framework introduced by Katz and Murphy (1992) has been extensively used to explain changes in the wage structure in the U. S. This canonical model uses exogenous supplies determined by educational attainment and time trends to proxy the evolution of relative demand for college labour. It is natural to ask whether this simple framework can explain regional evolutions in the college wage premia. The college wage premia move more or less similarly <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>regions,</b> but <b>the</b> time patterns for the college-high school relative supply differ considerably <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>regions</b> after <b>the</b> early 1980 s. Using the standard approach in the literature, I find that elasticities of substitution between college and high school labour and trends in relative demand for college labour differ significantly <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>regions.</b> <b>The</b> standard approach arbitrarily separates skills from prices by assuming all workers of an education group have the same skill over time, so all wage movements are assumed to be driven by changes in skill prices alone. I examine whether the differences in elasticities and trends still remain when a careful distinction between prices and wages is made. First, I fin...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{treatment is}} given of number fluctuations induced by mobility fluctuations in <b>the</b> intrinsic <b>region</b> of a p-i-n diode.
