25|$|Small {{intestinal}} volvulus {{is thought}} to be caused by a change in local peristalsis, or due to a lesion that the mesentery may twist around (such as an <b>ascarid</b> impaction), and usually involves the distal jejunum and ileum.w It {{is one of the most}} common causes of small intestinal obstruction in foals, possibly because of a sudden change to a bulkier foodstuff. Animals present with acute and severe signs of colic, and multiple distended loops of small intestine, usually seen radiographically in a foal. Small intestinal volvulus often occurs secondary to another disease process in adult horses, where small intestinal obstruction causes distention and then rotation around the root of the mesentery. Surgery is required to resect nonviable sections of bowel, and prognosis is correlated to the length of bowel involved, with animals with greater than 50% of small intestinal involvement having a grave prognosis.|$|E

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of endoparasites was evaluated in 619 dogs and 153 cats in the Calgary, Alberta region. Both homed and shelter-sourced pets were evaluated, and prevalence was assessed in various age groups. The overall endoparasite prevalence was 16. 5 % in canine samples and 7. 2 % in feline samples. The most common intestinal parasites in dogs were Giardia (8. 1 %) and <b>ascarids</b> (4. 2 %). The most common feline endoparasite was <b>ascarids</b> (6. 5 %).

50|$|<b>Ascarid</b> {{eggs are}} {{resistant}} to desiccation, persist {{for a long time}} in the environment, and remain directly infective.

This organism is responsible for the disease ascariasis, a type of helminthiasis and one of the group of neglected tropical diseases.

50|$|Toxascaris leonina is {{a common}} {{parasitic}} roundworm found in dogs, cats, foxes, and related host species. Toxascaris leonina, or T. leonina, is an <b>ascarid</b> nematode, a worldwide distributed helminth parasite which is in a division of eukaryotic parasites that, unlike external parasites such as lice and fleas, live inside their host. The definitive hosts of T. leonina include canids (dogs, foxes, etc.) and felines (cats), while the intermediate hosts are usually rodents, such as mice or rats. Infection occurs in the definitive host when the animal eats an infected rodent. While T. leonina can occur in either dogs or cats, {{it is far more}} frequent in cats.|$|E
40|$|This paper reports an {{approach}} to the identification of prehistoric parasitic infection, which integrates traditional morphological methods with molecular methods. The approach includes the strengths of each method while mitigating the limitations. Demonstrating the efficacy of this approach, we provide a case study from a 1400 year old desiccated fecal sample from La Cueva de los Muertos Chiquitos, archaeological site, near Rio Zape, Durango, Mexico. Traditionally prepared microscope slides were processed via microscopy and tentative <b>ascarids</b> were identified. Information regarding the parasites’ developmental stage was recorded. DNA was then extracted directly from the slide material. From this DNA extract, a small segment of the 18 S ribosomal RNA gene variant that is specific to Ascaris, and its phylogenetically close relatives, was targeted for PCR amplification and sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis of the DNA sequence best matched a member of physalopterids, rather than <b>ascarids,</b> with a single exception of a match to Contracaecum spiculigerum. Subsequent extractions, amplifications and sequencing of the original rehydrated coprolite material confirmed these results. The C. spiculigerum sequence represented a phylogenetic anomaly and subsequent analysis determined the sequence was an error in the BLAST database, likely attributable to misidentification of juvenile specimens prior to sequencing and submission. Physaloptera are a difficult genus to identify morphologically and can carry major health burdens. They may be underreported in humans, in part, because of morphological similarities to the more common human parasites belonging to <b>ascarids.</b> We conclude that integrating traditional morphological methods with molecular methods can help resolve this issue, in both contemporary and prehistoric populations...|$|R

5000|$|Infections with A. suum, and {{especially}} the larval migration phase, have shown to reduce the economic profitability of a pig farm. The presence of this parasite on a pig farm reduces its productivity {{in a number of}} direct or indirect ways. Perhaps the most obvious of which is the condemnation of the livers that are visibly affected by parasite migration. Whether the liver is trimmed or fully condemned evidently depends on the amount of white spots detected on the liver. At the level of the lung, the passage of <b>ascarid</b> larvae is associated with impaired pulmonary bacterial clearance [...] making it easier for secondary bacterial and viral infections to settle. Increased susceptibility to Pasteurella multicoda, Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. have already been associated with ascariosis. Moreover, a recent study also observed a significant negative effect of A. suum infection on the seroconversion and antibody levels to a Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae vaccine.

40|$|Toxocariasis {{is caused}} by a series of related {{nematode}} species (<b>ascarids)</b> that routinely infect dogs and cats throughout the world. The eggs from these <b>ascarids</b> are common environmental contaminants of human habitation, due largely to the fact that many kinds of dogs and cats serve as pets, while countless others run wild throughout the streets of most urban centers. The eggs, present in dog and cat feces, become infectious within weeks after they are deposited in the local environment (e. g., sandboxes, city parks, and public beaches, etc.). Humans, particularly children, frequently ingest these eggs by accident and become infected. Infection in humans, in contrast to their definitive hosts, remains occult, often resulting in disease caused by the migrating larval stages. Visceral larva migrans (VLM) and ocular larva migrans (OLM) are two clinical manifestations that result in definable syndromes and present as serious health problems wherever they occur. Diagnosis and treatment of VLM and OLM are difficult.
