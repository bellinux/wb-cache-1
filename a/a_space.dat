5|$|According to Tough, it is {{unlikely}} that the avoidance of immediate dangers and prevention of future catastrophes would be conducted through radio, as these tasks would demand constant surveillance and quick action. However, cultural cooperation might take place through radio or <b>a</b> <b>space</b> probe in the Solar System, as radio waves could be used to communicate information about advanced technologies and cultures to humanity.|$|E
5|$|As of 2009, {{graphene}} {{appears to}} be the strongest material ever tested. The process of separating it from graphite will require some further technological development before it is economical for industrial processes.
