40|$|According to the {{political}} context, moving images proved {{from the very beginning}} to be an ally or an enemy of History. Even the pre-cinema performances – various forms of lanterna magica – had to pay tribute to {{the political}} correctness of the day in reflecting France tribulations from Revolution to Restoration. The newsreel The Coronation of Russia’s Emperor Nicolas II, shot in 1896 by two of Lumière’s cameramen, features Romania’s future Queen Mary, who, 25 years later, reviewed in poignant terms that cultural experience in her Diary. In Romania, the first cinema public screenings were acclaimed for the future historic value of the shots, even if some producers, as Georges Méliès, indulged themselves in providing re-enacted newsreels, getting an ironic comment from King Edward VII of England. Romanian mass-media was also among the first ones to acknowledge the strong popular impact of historical features. Soon it was proved that, for small countries, the new art was <b>a</b> precious <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the world the truth about their history. At the eve of 20 th century, Romanian poets and writers, actors and filmmakers pleaded enthusiastically for the young art, seen, among others, in a revival mood of the 1848 movement, as a tool for promoting their patriotic ideals. The monumental period docudrama The Independence of Romania, produced by Leon Popescu and directed by Grigore Brezeanu, acquired unexpected contemporary meanings, especially in Transylvania, still occupied by the Austro-Hungarian Empire...|$|R

40|$|This paper makes {{recommendations}} {{regarding the}} welfare of refugee and asylum-seeking children. Foreword Unaccompanied children {{are some of the}} most vulnerable in our society and throughout the world; they have been forced, separated or orphaned from their families through reasons of violence, fear and persecution. Yet many Australians would not be aware of their predicament; with no-one to advocate for their needs, their stories are rarely heard. The Taskforce has found that the current system of guardianship and care of unaccompanied children is failing on many fronts. It is convoluted, inequitable, grievously lacking in transparency and accountability and it is a system which can be cruel. Unaccompanied children are receiving vastly different treatment and care, depending on a multitude of factors; how they arrived; the ‘stream’ through which they are ‘processed’; the timing of their arrival; the competency of the various bureaucrats assessing their age or conducting interviews (often while no independent advocate is present such as during enhanced screening, at Christmas Island and certainly during these latest ‘on-water transfers’ for example); the quality of the detention they’re locked up in; and the outcome of the ‘care lotto’ should they be fortunate enough to get that far. Shamefully too for Australia, some have been sent to detention camps offshore, and uncounted others have been forced back to the homelands from where they have fled persecution, before even being given <b>a</b> fair <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> their story and have their claim for asylum justly processed...|$|R

[...] She also stated that M.I.A. depicted violence in order to make a political point, in a way different from gangsta rap.

5000|$|The {{pilot was}} written by Chris Carter, {{best known as the}} creator of the science-fiction series The X-Files. Carter wrote the pilot as a [...] "high-tech version" [...] of his {{favorite}} films—Paths of Glory, Platoon and Blade Runner. He said of the pilot: [...] "I think this has a tremendous romantic story and a great mythology potential, as well. I think it's <b>a</b> great <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> allegorical stories … to take a godless world, where there is no morality, where there is no standard or code of behavior, and see what the world would be like if it were like that." [...] The Fox executives worried that pilot episode included too much violence for the 8:00 p.m. timeslot, and they tried to get the producers of the show to tone the violence down in upcoming episodes. American writer Judd Apatow said he doubted Carter would tone down the violence: [...] "He's going to do what he wants to do, and he should. I don't think it's his place to tone it down for people. It's parents' place to say, 'You know what? You're not allowed to watch Harsh Realm'. But it's much easier to say, 'Take off the shows' than <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> parents <b>to</b> be aware of what their kids are doing." [...] Terry O'Quinn stars in the episode as Omar Santiago. He was concerned that the viewers would find the show confusing, [...] "There might be some things if you miss the first one you won't know what is going on. The writers {{are going to have to}} find a good one- or two-minute intro that explains things." [...] When O'Quinn first read the script of the pilot, he [...] "pretty much understood the concept of the show when I read it, but I had a hard time visualizing it. I'm kind of computer illiterate. So I had a tough time seeing it. But the fact that Carter is doing it is a good starting point." ...|$|R
