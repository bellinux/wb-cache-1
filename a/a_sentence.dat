5|$|Putnam has {{consistently}} {{adhered to the}} idea of semantic holism, in spite of the many changes in his other positions. The problems with this position have been described by Michael Dummett, Jerry Fodor, Ernest Lepore, and others. In the first place, they suggest that, if semantic holism is true, it is impossible to understand how a speaker of a language can learn the meaning of an expression, for any expression of the language. Given the limits of our cognitive abilities, we {{will never be able to}} master the whole of the English (or any other) language, even based on the (false) assumption that languages are static and immutable entities. Thus, if one must understand all of a natural language to understand a single word or expression, language learning is simply impossible. Semantic holism also fails to explain how two speakers can mean the same thing when using the same linguistic expression, and therefore how any communication at all is possible between them. Given <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> P, since Fred and Mary have each mastered different parts of the English language and P is related in different ways to the sentences in each part, the result is that P means one thing for Fred and something else for Mary. Moreover, if <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> P derives its meaning from its relations with all of the sentences of a language, as soon as the vocabulary of an individual changes by the addition or elimination of <b>a</b> <b>sentence,</b> the totality of relations changes, and therefore also the meaning of P. As this is a common phenomenon, the result is that P has two different meanings in two different moments in the life of the same person. Consequently, if I accept the truth of <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> and then reject it later on, the meaning of that which I rejected and that which I accepted are completely different and therefore I cannot change my opinions with regard to the same sentences.|$|E

5|$|As Swedish is a Germanic language, the syntax shows {{similarities}} to both English and German.

(Adverbial phrases denoting time are usually {{placed at the}} beginning of a main clause that is at the head of <b>a</b> <b>sentence.)</b> Prepositional phrases are placed in a place–manner–time order, as in English (but not German).

5|$|Assonance, {{where the}} use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the {{beginning}} or end of a word, was widely used in skaldic poetry, but {{goes back to the}} Homeric epic.

Consonance provokes a more subtle effect than alliteration and so is less useful as a structural element.|$|E
