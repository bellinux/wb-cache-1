The main path resonates at around 30Hz, but the complicated sinus anatomy causes peaks and valleys in the sound.|$|E
5|$|Diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) is an {{inflammatory}} lung disease of unknown cause. It is a severe, progressive form of bronchiolitis, {{an inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} bronchioles (small <b>air</b> <b>passages</b> in the lungs). The term diffuse signifies that lesions appear throughout both lungs, while panbronchiolitis refers to inflammation found in all layers of the respiratory bronchioles (those involved in gas exchange). DPB causes severe inflammation and nodule-like lesions of terminal bronchioles, chronic sinusitis, and intense coughing with large amounts of sputum production.|$|E
5|$|In many people, the {{infection}} waxes and wanes. Tissue destruction and necrosis are often balanced by healing and fibrosis. Affected tissue {{is replaced by}} scarring and cavities filled with caseous necrotic material. During active disease, some of these cavities are joined to the <b>air</b> <b>passages</b> bronchi and this material can be coughed up. It contains living bacteria, so can spread {{the infection}}. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics kills bacteria and allows healing to take place. Upon cure, affected areas are eventually replaced by scar tissue.|$|E

25|$|EIPH {{occurs when}} blood enters the <b>air</b> <b>passages</b> of a horse's lung, due to {{fractured}} capillaries. A variety of causes have been proposed, but EIPH {{is most likely}} a multi-factorial condition, involving airway, vascular, inflammatory, blood, cardiac, locomotory, and remodelling components.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the hormones}} {{involved}} during {{the state of}} fight-or-flight include epinephrine, which regulates heart rate and metabolism as well as dilating blood vessels and <b>air</b> <b>passages,</b> norepinephrine increasing heart rate, blood flow to skeletal muscles {{and the release of}} glucose from energy stores, and cortisol which increases blood sugar, increases circulating neutrophilic leukocytes, calcium amongst other things.|$|E
25|$|In {{the cases}} of some throat cancers, the <b>air</b> <b>passages</b> in the mouth and behind the nose may become blocked from lumps or the {{swelling}} from the open sores. If the throat cancer is {{near the bottom of}} the throat it has a high likelihood of spreading to the lungs and interfering with the person’s ability to breathe; this is even more likely if the person is a smoker, because they are highly susceptible to lung cancer.|$|E

25|$|Mortality {{remained}} elevated {{for months}} after the fog. A preliminary report, never finalised, blamed the ongoing deaths on an influenza epidemic. Emerging evidence revealed that {{only a fraction of}} the deaths could be from influenza. Most of the deaths were caused by respiratory tract infections, from hypoxia and as a result of mechanical obstruction of the <b>air</b> <b>passages</b> by pus arising from lung infections caused by the smog. The lung infections were mainly bronchopneumonia or acute purulent bronchitis superimposed upon chronic bronchitis.|$|E
25|$|The skull was long, low, and curved so {{that both}} {{extremities}} {{were higher than}} the middle. The premaxilla bones that formed {{the end of the}} snout were enlarged to form a wide tip; there were at least four teeth in the right premaxilla and five in the left. The left maxilla (main tooth-bearing bone of the upper jaw) is more complete than the right, and had at least 29teeth. There was a deep groove along the midline of the nasals and the frontals; the frontals were fused into a single bone, as is seen in other adult mesoeucrocodylians. Unlike derived neosuchians, it had external antorbital fenestrae. Tykoski and colleagues subjected the skull to CT scanning, which revealed internal cavities and <b>air</b> <b>passages,</b> and showed that it had a double-walled secondary palate similar to that of true crocodylians, and similar pneumatic cavities as well.|$|E
500|$|Running {{through the}} head are two <b>air</b> <b>passages.</b> [...] The left passage runs {{alongside}} the spermaceti organ and goes {{directly to the}} blowhole, whilst the right passage runs underneath the spermaceti organ and passes air through a pair of phonic lips and into the distal sac at the very front of the nose. The distal sac {{is connected to the}} blowhole and the terminus of the left passage. [...] When the whale is submerged, it can close the blowhole, and air that passes through the phonic lips can circulate back to the lungs. The sperm whale, unlike other odontocetes, has only one pair of phonic lips, whereas all other toothed whales have two, and it is located {{at the front of the}} nose instead of behind the melon.|$|E

500|$|The {{mouth of}} the holotype of Corythosaurus is narrow. The praemaxillae each form two long folds. The folds enclose <b>air</b> <b>passages</b> {{extending}} the narial passages {{to the front of}} the snout. There they end in narrow openings, sometimes called [...] "pseudonares", false bony nostrils. These were mistaken by Brown for the real nares or nostrils. These are actually situated inside the crest, above the eye sockets. As in Saurolophus, the expanded portion of the premaxillary in front of the pseudonaris' opening is elongate: by comparison, in Kritosaurus, the bill is short, and the pseudonares extend far forward. At the end of the Corythosaurus bill, the two pseudonares unite into one. Because of his incorrect identification, Brown assumed that the holotype's inferior process of the premaxillary was shorter than in Kritosaurus and Saurolophus, and that the process does not unite with the lacrimal, another difference from those genera. The praemaxilla actually does touch the lacrimal and extends to the rear until well behind the eye socket.|$|E
500|$|The greater {{adjutant}} {{is a huge}} bird, {{standing tall}} at [...] The average length is [...] and average wingspan is [...] While no weights have been published for wild birds, the greater adjutant is among the largest of living storks, with published measurements overlapping {{with those of the}} jabiru (Jabiru mycteria), saddle-billed stork (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis) and marabou stork (Leptoptilos crumeniferus). Juvenile greater adjutant storks in captivity weighed from [...] For comparison, the heaviest known wild stork was a marabou stork scaling [...] The huge bill, which averages [...] long, is wedge-like and is pale grey with a darker base. The wing chord averages , the tail [...] and the tarsus [...] in length. With the exception of the tarsus length, the standard measurements of the greater adjutant are on average greater than that of other stork species. A white collar ruff at the base of its bare yellow to red-skinned neck gives it a vulture-like appearance. In the breeding season, the pouch and neck become bright orange and the upper thighs of the grey legs turn reddish. Adults have a dark wing that contrasts with light grey secondary coverts. The underside of the body is whitish and the sexes are indistinguishable in the field. Juveniles are a duller version of the adult. The pendant inflatable pouch connects to the <b>air</b> <b>passages</b> and is not connected to the digestive tract. The exact function is unknown, but it is not involved in food storage as was sometimes believed. This was established in 1825 by Dr John Adam, a student of Professor Robert Jameson, who dissected a specimen and found the two layered pouch filled mainly with air. The only possible confusable species in the region is the smaller lesser adjutant (Leptoptilos javanicus), which lacks a pouch, prefers wetland habitats, has a lighter grey skull cap, a straighter edge to the upper mandible and lacks the contrast between the grey secondary coverts and the dark wings.|$|E

2500|$|During {{exhalation}} the intrapulmonary bronchi {{were believed}} to be tightly constricted between the region where the ventrobronchi branch off and the region where the dorsobronchi branch off. But it is now believed that more intricate aerodynamic features have the same effect. [...] The contracting posterior air sacs can therefore only empty into the dorsobronchi. From there the fresh air from the posterior air sacs flows through the parabronchi (in the same direction as occurred during inhalation) into ventrobronchi. The <b>air</b> <b>passages</b> connecting the ventrobronchi and anterior air sacs to the intrapulmonary bronchi open up during exhalation, thus allowing oxygen-poor air from these two organs to escape via the trachea to the exterior. Oxygenated air therefore flows constantly (during the entire breathing cycle) in a single direction through the parabronchi.|$|E
2500|$|During {{exhalation}} {{the pressure}} in the posterior air sacs (which were filled with fresh air during inhalation) increases due to the contraction of the oblique muscle described above. The aerodynamics of the interconnecting openings from the posterior air sacs to the dorsobronchi and intrapulmonary bronchi ensures that the air leaves these sacs {{in the direction of}} the lungs (via the dorsobronchi), rather than returning down the intrapulmonary bronchi (Fig.18). From the dorsobronchi the fresh air from the posterior air sacs flows through the parabronchi (in the same direction as occurred during inhalation) into ventrobronchi. The <b>air</b> <b>passages</b> connecting the ventrobronchi and anterior air sacs to the intrapulmonary bronchi direct the [...] "spent", oxygen poor air from these two organs to the trachea from where it escapes to the exterior. Oxygenated air therefore flows constantly (during the entire breathing cycle) in a single direction through the parabronchi.|$|E

The swirler structure includes a cylindrical <b>air</b> swirler <b>passage,</b> also shaped by etching, through at least one other thin plate. The cylindrical <b>air</b> swirler <b>passage</b> is located in co-axial relation to the spray orifice of the plate of the fuel metering set such that fuel directed through the spray orifice passes through the <b>air</b> swirler <b>passage</b> and swirling <b>air</b> is imparted to the fuel such that the fuel has a swirling component of motion. At least one air feed slot is provided in fluid communication with the <b>air</b> swirler <b>passage</b> and extends in non-radial relation thereto. <b>Air</b> supply <b>passages</b> extend through the plates of the metering set and the swirler structure to feed the air feed slot in each plate of the swirler structure...|$|R

2500|$|The {{skull of}} Euoplocephalus resembles a {{truncated}} equilateral triangle {{when viewed from}} above, and is slightly wider than it is long. The largest known skull, that of specimen AMNH 5403, has a length of 411 millimetres and a width of 478 millimetres. Most skull elements are completely fused and two skull openings normally present with dinosaurs, the antorbital fenestra and the upper temporal fenestra, have closed. The skull has nineteen to twenty-four teeth in each upper jaw. The frontmost snout bone, the premaxilla, is toothless. The teeth are very small, with a maximal height and width of just 7.5 millimetres. The strongly drooping snout is blunt, wide and high, and filled with very complex <b>air</b> <b>passages</b> and sinuses, the form and function of which are not yet completely understood. Each side has two external nostrils. The lower jaw has a very concave upper rim with twenty-one teeth. At its front a short low extension is present, to provide contact with the wide predentary, the bony core of the lower horny beak, that fitted within the upper beak of the snout.|$|E
2500|$|This species' {{reputation}} as a public nuisance is due not to any bite or sting (it is incapable of either), but to its slightly acidic body chemistry. Because airborne lovebugs can exist in enormous numbers near highways, they die in large numbers on automobile windshields, hoods, and radiator grills when the vehicles travel at high speeds. If left {{for more than an}} hour or two, the remains become extremely difficult to remove. Their body chemistry has a nearly neutral 6.5 pH but may become acidic at 4.25 pH if left on the car for a day. [...] In the past, the acidity of the dead adult body, especially the female's egg masses, often resulted in pits and etches in automotive paint and chrome if not quickly removed. [...] However, advances in automotive paints and protective coatings have reduced this threat significantly. Now the greatest concern is excessive clogging of vehicle radiator <b>air</b> <b>passages</b> with the bodies of the adults, with the reduction of the cooling effect on engines, and the obstruction of windshields when the remains of the adults and egg masses are smeared on the glass.|$|E

30|$|The initial {{characteristic}} of the combination of different waste mixture content piles is shown in Table  1. Flower waste, cow dung and saw dust contained 82.01, 80.10 and 16.71 % of moisture content, respectively. Singh and Kalamdhad (2014) reported that bulking agent regulates moisture content and provides free <b>air</b> <b>passage.</b> In pile P 0 (100  kg), flower waste lump formation was observed {{on the third day}} and it was possibly due to excess moisture content and lack of <b>air</b> <b>passage</b> between the particles. Leachate production was also observed in pile P 0. The covering of each pile with plastic sheet helped to increase the temperature inside the pile and it reached the thermophilic phase within one day. Due to the presence of moisture and the action of microbes there was an increase in humidity inside the pile. As a result, vapours were seen on the inner surface of the plastic sheets.|$|R
50|$|Many VAF sensors have an air-fuel {{adjustment}} screw, {{which opens}} or closes a small <b>air</b> <b>passage</b> {{on the side}} of the VAF sensor. This screw controls the air-fuel mixture by letting a metered amount of air flow past the air flap, thereby leaning or richening the mixture. By turning the screw clockwise the mixture is enriched and counterclockwise the mixture is leaned.|$|R
5000|$|In {{nautical}} parlance, {{the draft}} or draught of a sail is {{a degree of}} curvature in a horizontal cross-section. [...] Any sail experiences a force from the prevailing wind just because it impedes the <b>air's</b> <b>passage.</b> A sail with draft also functions as an airfoil when set at an angle slightly greater than {{the angle of the}} wind, producing lift which then propels.|$|R
