5|$|Countries with {{decades of}} {{experience}} in comprehensive emergency medical systems have expertise that nations that <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> emergency medical programs lack. Thus, there exists considerable opportunity for the transfer of knowledge to assist newly founded programs. Such transfers may be made either from a distance or in person. For instance, the International Emergency Medicine Fellowship at the University of Toronto sent a three-person team to Cluj-Napoca, Romania, to promote the local development of emergency medicine. An assessment of the present status was performed that identified targets for improvement in physical plant organization and patient flow; staffing, staff education, equipment, medication and supplies; and infection control practices. Following these designations, plans regarding these areas were collaboratively drawn up and then implemented, partially through international exchange trips.|$|E

Mechanical buckling forces {{due to the}} expanding brain tissue probably cause the cortical surface to fold.

25|$|Some of the PCC cars {{once owned}} by Twin City Rapid Transit <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> their lives as museum pieces. The Newark City Subway {{finished}} operation of their 24 remaining cars on August 24, 2001, replacing the cars with new light-rail trainsets. Fifteen have been sold to the San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni), for their collection of classic streetcars on the Market Street Railway. In addition, 12 PCCs that ran on the Shaker Heights line are now owned by the Brooklyn Historic Railway Association. Many of these cars owe their longevity {{to the fact that}} the Twin Cities area makes heavy use of salt to de-ice roadways in the winter. In anticipation of this, the cars were largely made of stainless steel to prevent corrosion.|$|E

500|$|The most massive main-sequence stars {{will also}} have the highest {{absolute}} magnitude, and these {{will be the first}} to evolve into the giant star stage. As the cluster ages, stars of successively lower masses will also enter the giant star stage. Thus the age of a single population cluster can be measured by looking for the stars that <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> to enter the giant star stage. This forms a [...] "knee" [...] in the HR diagram, bending to the upper right from the main-sequence line. The absolute magnitude at this bend is directly a function of the age of globular cluster, so an age scale can be plotted on an axis parallel to the magnitude.|$|E

In the pilot episode, when her parents are killed in the first meteor shower, Lana is adopted by her aunt Nell (Sarah-Jane Redmond). As the first season progresses, Lana grows closer to Clark, while Whitney begins to distance himself because of his father's medical ailments. In season two's episode [...] "Heat" [...] Lana sends Whitney, who left Smallville for the Marines in the season one finale, a video message breaking up with him. Lana's aunt Nell moves to Metropolis with her fiancé in the season two episode [...] "Ryan", but Lana opts {{to move in with}} her friend Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) so that she may finish high school in Smallville.|$|E
500|$|Nick Pino of TechRadar, {{giving it}} four stars out of five, {{similarly}} {{felt that the}} Xbox One [...] " [...] more like a media titan today than it did 12 months ago," [...] citing OneGuide, Upload Studio, and Microsoft's decision to drop the Xbox Live Gold requirement for multimedia streaming apps, and that [...] "there's {{still a lot of}} potential locked away inside the hardware of the system that developers <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> to figure out. So while PlayStation might have the upper hand for now when it comes to certain third-party titles, it may not always remain that way. Just how Microsoft will get it to that point, though, is still a mystery." [...] However, he disfavored the console's dependence upon a subscription for most of its functionality, Kinect's voice recognition, and that some games do not natively run at 1080p resolution, but are upscaled. In an August 2016 review of the Xbox One S model, TechRadar further commended Microsoft's recent improvements to Xbox One, citing a strong lineup of first-party titles in 2015 and further improvements to the console's interface.|$|E

500|$|Robert Nathan's 1966 romantic comedy, Juliet in Mantua, {{presents}} Rosaline as a {{fully developed}} character. [...] In this sequel, in which Romeo and Juliet did not die, the pair live {{ten years later}} in exile in Mantua. [...] After they are forgiven and return to Verona, they learn that Rosaline is now married to County Paris, and both couples must confront their disillusionment with their marriages. [...] Another play, After Juliet, written by Scottish playwright Sharman Macdonald, {{tells the story of}} Rosaline after Romeo dies. A main character in this play, she struggles with her loss and turns away the advances of Benvolio, who has fallen in love with her. Macdonald's daughter, Keira Knightley, played Rosaline in the play's 1999 premiere. The 2012 young adult novel [...] "When You Were Mine" [...] by Rebecca Serle sets Rosaline's story in a contemporary high school. Rosaline and Romeo (renamed Rob) have been best friends since childhood and <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> to fall in love when Rosaline's cousin, Juliet, moves back into town and sets her sights on Rob.

Abby is unable to forgive her mother until Jennifer realizes she is pregnant, but tragedy strikes again when Jennifer learns that her baby will have serious mental and physical deformities, and Lexie advises her to terminate.|$|E
2500|$|Cotton mills have abounded in the Spartanburg {{area since}} 1816, earning Spartanburg the {{reputation}} as the [...] "Lowell of the South." [...] Although there were few mills in the area before the Civil War, technological advances, northern capital, and out-migration from the poor farms that made white labor available, created a wave of postbellum mill development here and {{in much of the}} Piedmont South. Additionally, the abundant streams and rivers in the area <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> their descent towards the lower-lying Midlands region. In many places, these waterways descend abruptly, providing a source for plentiful waterpower. Cotton mills were built along these rivers to harness this power, and so began the region’s servitude to King Cotton. These mills, their owners and their laborers dominated the politics and economy of the region for nearly a century. Although nearly all abandoned, many mills remain along the riverbanks, the Piedmont equivalent of Gothic ruins.|$|E

[...] The site of the decisive battle against the Echthroi in A Wind in the Door, it serves to demonstrate L'Engle's premise that variations in size [...] "are in reality, quite unimportant," [...] as Blajeny states in the book; and that macrocosm and microcosm are both part of the interdependence of everything in the Cosmos. [...] "If a butterfly winging over the fields around Crosswicks should be hurt, the effect would be felt in galaxies thousands of light years away," [...] L'Engle says in A Stone for a Pillow. [...] "The interrelationship of all of Creation is sensitive in a way we <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> to understand."

2500|$|As {{children}} {{move forward}} with their reading skills, they {{learn a great deal}} about what is really inside a word; the stem, roots, prefixes and suffixes that make up morphemes of the language. [...] By this stage, children already know about the common bound morphemes such as [...] "s" [...] and [...] "ed" [...] because these are attached to many words. [...] Decoding readers become exposed to many types of morphemes such as prefixes and suffixes, and it is when they learn to read these as [...] "sight chunks" [...] that their reading and their understanding will speed up dramatically. Being able to read at a fluent level is not only about how fast a child can read, but {{it is a matter of}} being able to utilize all the special knowledge that they have about a word—its letters, letter patterns, meanings, grammatical functions, roots, and endings—fast enough that they have time to think and comprehend what they are seeing. [...] The point of becoming a proficient reader is to fluently read and comprehend what had just been read. Decoding readers <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>beginning</b> to understand and learn how to use their expanding knowledge of language and their growing powers of inference to figure out what they are really reading.|$|E
