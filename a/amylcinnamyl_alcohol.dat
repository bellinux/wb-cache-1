40|$|This master thesis {{deals with}} the {{assessment}} of selected fragrant substances in cosmetic products. At the beginning the occurrence, methods of acquiring and application of these substances is described. They are essential components primarily in cosmetic products, however they can cause an allergic reaction in sensitive individuals. The theoretical part of this thesis also describes the cause and the progress of these undesirable effects. There are several hundreds, up to thousands fragrant substances used in the perfume industry, from which 26 was designated by the European regulations as potential allergenic fragrant substances and their content is regulated. Legislative standards {{as well as the}} overview of the methods used to determine these fragrances are given here. The experimental part is focused on the development and validation of the separation methods for determining of the selected and potentially allergenic fragrant substances. The method used was a solid phase microextraction using Carboxen/Polydimethylsiloxane fiber combined with a gas chromatography coupled to a flame ionization detector (SPME-GC-FID). <b>Amylcinnamyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> benzyl alcohol, cinnamyl alcohol, coumarin, lyral, ?-isomethyl ionone were among the determined allergenic substance. Consequently, this method was also applied on 10 selected cosmetic products specimens, in which the linalool and geraniol were identified as the most common allergenic substances...|$|E
40|$|The European {{legislation}} {{on cosmetic products}} has recently required the declaration of 26 compounds (24 volatile chemicals and 2 natural extracts) on the label of final products when exceeding a stipulated cut-off level. In this work a rapid reliable and specific RP-HPLC method coupled with diode array detector (DAD) has been developed for the simultaneous determination and quantification of the 24 volatile chemicals: amyl cinnamal, benzyl alcohol, cinnamyl alcohol, citral, eugenol, hydroxy-citronellal, isoeugenol, <b>amylcinnamyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> benzyl salicylate, cinnamal, coumarin, geraniol, Lyral (hydroxy-methylpentylcyclohexene carboxaldehyde), anisyl alcohol, benzyl cinnamate, farnesol, Lilial (2 -(4 -tert-butylbenzyl) propionaldehyde) linalool, benzyl benzoate, citronellol, hexyl cinnamal, limonene, methylheptin carbonate, alpha-isomethyl ionone (3 -methyl- 4 -(2, 6, 6 -trimethyl- 2 -cyclohexen- 1 -yl) - 3 -buten- 2 -one). The 24 analytes were appropriately separated over a running time of 40 min, on a C 18 column using a simple gradient elution (acetonitrile/water) with flow rate from 0. 7 to 1. 0 ml/min and UV acquisition at 210, 254 and 280 nm. All calibration curves showed good linearity (r 2 > 0. 99) within test ranges. The method was successfully applied to the qualitative and quantitative determination of the potential allergens in four commercial scented products, with satisfactory accuracy and precision. The results indicated that this simple and efficient method {{can be used for}} quality assessment of complex matrices such us cosmetic scented products...|$|E
