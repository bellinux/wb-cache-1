5|$|Fare is payable by MetroCard. Since {{this card}} enables free {{transfers}} for a continuing {{ride on the}} subway and bus systems, for many more riders there is effectively no fare at all for riding SIR. Riders are also allowed to transfer between a Staten Island bus, SIR, and <b>a</b> <b>Manhattan</b> bus or subway near South Ferry. Because of this, the SIR's farebox recovery ratio in 2001 was 0.16that is, for every dollar of expense, 16 cents was recovered in fares, the lowest ratio of MTA agencies. The low farebox recovery ratio {{is part of the}} reason the MTA wishes to merge the SIR with the subway proper which will simplify the accounting and subsidization of what is essentially a single line.|$|E
