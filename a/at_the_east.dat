5|$|A royal {{charter of}} 1215 gave Wellington {{its status as}} a town, and during the medieval period it grew as a centre for trade on the road from Bristol to Exeter, being laid out, with the church <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>east</b> end of town, in a similar manner to other towns of this era. In 1548, the manor was sold to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, but reverted to the control of the bishops after his execution.

5|$|A trio {{of small}} Early Classic temples (Temples 29 to 31) stand upon a common {{platform}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>east</b> {{end of the}} terrace, facing west. It {{is likely that the}} platform was purposely built to support the three temples that were built more-or-less simultaneously. Neither the platform nor the temples have been investigated; it is therefore possible that an early version of the central temple (Temple 30) was built first, then decommissioned with the platform being built to cover the early version, followed by {{the construction of a new}} version plus the two additional flanking temples.|$|E
5|$|According to the Orkneyinga Saga, {{in the war}} which followed, Thorfinn {{defeated}} Karl in a sea-battle off Deerness <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>east</b> end of the Orkney Mainland. Then Karl's nephew Mutatan or Muddan, {{appointed to}} rule Caithness for him, was killed at Thurso by Thorkel the Fosterer. Finally, a great battle at Tarbat Ness {{on the south side}} of the Dornoch Firth ended with Karl defeated and fugitive or dead. Thorfinn, the saga says, then marched south through Scotland as far as Fife, burning and plundering as he passed. A later note in the saga claims that Thorfinn won nine Scottish earldoms.|$|E
5|$|After {{intersecting}} with NY289, NY178 progresses northeastward, {{intersecting with}} the western terminus of CR84 {{in the community of}} Thomas Settlement. After leaving Thomas Settlement, NY178 intersects with CR77 and turning to the southeast through a rural region before entering the village of Adams at an intersection with Cobbville Road. There, the surroundings become further residential, before the highway connects to I-81 at exit41. After the interchange, NY178 becomes known as Church Street West, crosses over a railroad line and enters the downtown portion of Adams. After the intersection with Clay Street, NY178 intersects with US11 (Main Street), where the NY178 designation ends. The right-of-way continues eastward as Church Street East, which becomes CR69 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>east</b> village line.|$|E
