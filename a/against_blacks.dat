5|$|A race riot {{broke out}} in May 1943 of whites <b>against</b> <b>blacks.</b> ADDSCO {{management}} had long maintained segregated conditions at the shipyards, although the Roosevelt administration had ordered defense contractors to integrate facilities. That year ADDSCO promoted 12 blacks to positions as welders, previously reserved for whites; and whites objected to the change by rioting on May 24. The mayor appealed to the governor to call in the National Guard to restore order, but it was weeks before officials allowed African Americans to return to work, keeping them away for their safety.|$|E

5|$|Communally, {{conditions}} for black Harlemites improved by 1943, with better employment in civil services, for instance. Economic problems became exacerbated under wartime conditions; new war and non-war industries and business continued to discriminate <b>against</b> <b>blacks.</b> Though new {{projects such as}} the Harlem River Houses were intended to expand black housing, by 1943, overall Harlem housing had deteriorated as new construction slowed due to diversion of efforts to the war, and buildings were destroyed in preparation for replacement. Although the state of African Americans improved relative to society, individuals could not accelerate their own progress.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the Civil Rights Movement {{challenging}} the restrictions and discrimination practiced <b>against</b> <b>blacks</b> exercise of constitutional rights, a series of US Supreme Court cases, beginning with Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, the 24th Amendment, and federal legislation: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 had overturned the most controversial aspects of the 1902 Constitution – the provisions restricting voting by African Americans and mandating school segregation. Combined with the election of Governor Mills Godwin in 1965, there was impetus for governmental change. Godwin strongly advocated the loosening of the strict constitutional restrictions on state-issued bonds and borrowing, and used his power and popularity to push for a new constitution. In 1968 a joint resolution of the Virginia General Assembly approved a new commission, chaired by former Governor Albertis Harrison, to revise the constitution.|$|E
25|$|The {{volatile}} {{social conditions}} produced white-led riots <b>against</b> <b>blacks</b> in 1829, when many blacks {{lost their homes}} and property. As Irish immigrants entered {{the city in the}} late 1840s, they competed with blacks at the lower levels of the economy. White-led riots <b>against</b> <b>blacks</b> occurred in 1836, when an abolitionist press was twice destroyed; and in 1842. More than one thousand blacks abandoned the city after the 1829 riots. Blacks in Philadelphia and other major cities raised money to help the refugees recover from the destruction. By 1842 blacks had become better established in the city; they defended their persons and property in the riot, and worked politically as well.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To match {{perfectly}} {{the optical}} properties of natural teeth, a scientific approach is needed by using digital technology that excludes bias to quantitatively characterize the optical properties of populations' teeth. The {{aim of this}} article is to present a method for a detailed clinical quantification of optical properties of front teeth. METHODS: A novel spectrophotometric approach was developed and applied on a preliminary group of subjects quantifying L* (luminosity) a* (quantity of green-red) and b* (quantity of blue-yellow) of enamel and enamel-dentin complex <b>against</b> <b>black</b> and white background. Based on these in vivo data, CR (opacity) and opalescence (the ability to reflect blue wavelength when white light stroke the object perpendicularly) were also calculated. RESULTS: The mean values of L* of the enamel-dentin complex <b>against</b> <b>black</b> and white background were 79. 6 and 75. 4, respectively. The mean values of a* were 2. 5 <b>against</b> <b>black</b> and 0. 8 against white background, respectively. The mean values of b* were 17. 4 <b>against</b> <b>black</b> and 13. 0 against white background, respectively. The mean contrast ratio was 86. 7 %. Opalescence value was 4. 8. The mean values of L* of enamel <b>against</b> <b>black</b> and white background were 79. 0 and 64. 2, respectively. The mean values of a* were 2. 1 <b>against</b> <b>black</b> and - 0. 3 against white background, respectively. The mean values of b* were 15. 2 <b>against</b> <b>black</b> and 8. 7 against white background, respectively. The mean contrast ratio was 60. 5 %. Opalescence value was 7. 4. SIGNIFICANCE: The described methodology, applied on a larger group of subjects, may serve as a database for a more exact characterization of optical properties of natural enamel and dentin...|$|R
25|$|Blacks {{defeated}} three {{efforts to}} disfranchise them, making alliances with immigrants to resist various Democratic campaigns. Disfranchising bills in 1905, 1907, and 1911 were rebuffed, {{in large part}} because of black opposition. Blacks comprised 20% of the electorate and immigrants comprised 15%, and the legislature had difficulty devising requirements <b>against</b> <b>blacks</b> that did not also disadvantage immigrants.|$|E
25|$|In Alabama, {{some young}} white urban activists joined the KKK, such as Hugo Black {{who was a}} member for a time; they were reformers {{fighting}} against the old guard in state politics. But the Klan in rural Alabama continued to operate to enforce Jim Crow; its members resorted more often to violence <b>against</b> <b>blacks</b> for infringements of the social order of white supremacy.|$|E
25|$|In Memphis, unlike {{disturbances}} {{in some other}} cities, ex-Confederate veterans were generally {{not part of the}} attacks <b>against</b> <b>blacks.</b> The outrages of the riot in Memphis and a similar one in New Orleans in September (the latter did include Confederate veterans) resulted in support in the North for Congress to pass the Reconstruction Act and the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.|$|E

25|$|After riots <b>against</b> <b>blacks</b> in Cincinnati, {{its black}} {{community}} sponsored {{founding of the}} Wilberforce Colony, an initially successful settlement of African-American immigrants to Canada.

25|$|The Nation of Islam, a black {{religious}} and political group, expressed several anti-Semitic pronouncements in the late 20th century.

25|$|White riots <b>against</b> <b>blacks</b> {{took place}} again in Cincinnati in 1836 and 1842.

Tensions increased after congressional passage in 1850 of the Fugitive Slave Act, which required cooperation by citizens in free states and increased penalties for failing to try to recapture escaped slaves.|$|E

25|$|Connor's {{brutality}} and tolerance for violence against {{civil rights activists}} contributed to KKK and other violence <b>against</b> <b>blacks</b> {{in the city of}} Birmingham. On a Sunday in September 1963, the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing destroyed much of the church that had been the center of the civil rights campaign, causing the death of four African-American girls. The city and movement leaders had just reached a negotiated agreement on integration of facilities and jobs.|$|E
25|$|Following the war, Delany {{continued}} to be politically active. He worked to help black cotton farmers improve their business and negotiating skills {{to get a better}} price for their product. He also argued <b>against</b> <b>blacks,</b> when he saw fit. For instance, he opposed the vice presidential candidacy of Jonathan Jasper Wright and John Mercer Langston on the grounds of inexperience, and he opposed the candidacy of another black man for the mayor of Charleston, South Carolina.|$|E
25|$|After World War I, {{there was}} a rise in lynchings and other racial {{violence}} directed by whites <b>against</b> <b>blacks</b> in the state, as well as across the South and in Chicago and Washington. It was due in part from strains of rapid social and economic changes, as well as competition for jobs, and lingering resentment resulting from the reconstruction after the Civil War as well as tensions among {{both black and white}} populations created by the return of black veterans.|$|E

25|$|Gibbs {{was born}} free in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on September 28, 1821. His father was Reverend Jonathan Gibbs I, a Methodist minister, {{and his mother}} Maria Jackson was a Baptist. Jonathan C. Gibbs II was the oldest of four {{children}} born to the couple. He grew up in Philadelphia {{during a time when}} the city was rife with anti-black and anti-abolitionist sentiments. Many white Northerners during this period practiced both white superiority and discrimination <b>against</b> <b>blacks.</b> Gibbs and his brother, Mifflin, attended the local Free School in Philadelphia.|$|E
25|$|The {{period after}} World War I was {{disruptive}} in the United States as numerous veterans sought to re-enter {{the job market}} and society. The government had no program to help them. Racial antagonism erupted in 1919 as race riots of whites <b>against</b> <b>blacks</b> in numerous cities across the North and Midwest; {{it was called the}} Red Summer of 1919. Unlike in mob action in the South, blacks in Chicago and other cities fought back against these attacks. After the riots subsided, racial relations between blacks and whites remained strained and volatile.|$|E
25|$|The {{first record}} of {{community}} violence <b>against</b> <b>blacks</b> in Omaha occurred in 1891, when an African American man called Joe Coe was lynched by a vigilante mob for allegedly raping a white girl. Another lynching occurred in 1919 when a white mob stormed the Douglas County Courthouse to take Willy Brown, an African American accused of raping a young white woman. While these incidents terrified {{the population of}} African Americans {{in the community and}} effectively segregated them {{from the rest of the}} city, the civil rights movement in Omaha did not gain large-scale momentum until the 1920s.|$|E
