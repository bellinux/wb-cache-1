The characteristic of factors affecting the accounting policies and determining the mechanism for evaluating the completeness and timeliness <b>of</b> intangible <b>assets</b> renewal is showed. The algorithm for selecting the method <b>of</b> intangible <b>assets</b> amortization is proposed. The knowledge base of statistical analysis of timeliness and completeness <b>of</b> intangible <b>assets</b> renewal in terms of the developed internal reporting is expanded. The statistical indicators to assess the effectiveness of the amortization policy for intangible assets are proposed.

40|$|Recent {{literature}} {{shows how}} the destabilising e¤ect of portfolio insurance activity on the price <b>of</b> the underlying <b>asset</b> depends on the liquidity <b>of</b> the <b>asset</b> market. We build a simple model where market timers shift capital around asset markets in order to exploit gains from temporary excess-volatility <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> prices. In this way, market timers increase the liquidity <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> markets reducing the excess volatility, while they increase the cross-market correlation, whereas long-ranged …nancial contagion eventually occurs. We show how liquidity <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> markets, cross-market correlation and excess volatility <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> prices depend on structural parameters <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> markets...|$|R
