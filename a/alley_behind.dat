5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} October 2011 in Georgia, with filming occurring in Atlanta (including Inman Park) and several areas in Cobb County (including the Oakleigh, Echo Mill, and Amberton subdivisions {{in the city}} of Powder Springs). Filming also took place at Marietta Square {{in the city of}} Marietta, where businesses were renamed and an <b>alley</b> <b>behind</b> Hemingway's Bar & Grill was treated to artificially age the buildings. One of the Marietta scenes filmed involved a young boy on a skateboard being abducted by aliens. Scenes were also filmed in the Brookhaven community. On October 25, 2011, a casting call was made for extras to fill the football stadium during two nights of filming on November 2–3 at Campbell High School in Smyrna, Georgia. On November 23, 2011 a minor, walk-on role in the film was auctioned to benefit the Stiller Foundation; the role was sold for $23,000 to an undisclosed bidder.|$|E

5000|$|The town of Morehead City {{was laid}} out using a grid plan, whereby city blocks were equally laid out with each block {{consisting}} of 16 equally divided lots. The city blocks stretched from 1st Street to 15th Street, incorporating a system of alleys forming an [...] "H" [...] shape that enabled businesses and residential homes to be served from the <b>alleys</b> <b>behind</b> them.|$|R
5|$|In 2002, the University of Dayton {{released}} a Master Plan {{which called for}} the renovation and construction of several houses, an extension to Stonemill Road to connect directly to Evanston Avenue, and the enlargement and clean-up of the parking areas in the <b>alleys</b> <b>behind</b> the houses. Despite ongoing rumors, there were no plans to raze the Ghetto {{and replace it with}} more high-density housing and other university buildings, despite the landlocked nature of the campus.|$|R
25|$|Mineo was {{arriving}} {{home after}} a rehearsal on February 12, 1976, when he was stabbed {{to death in the}} <b>alley</b> <b>behind</b> his apartment building near the Sunset Strip in West Hollywood, California. Mineo was stabbed just once, not repeatedly as first reported, but the knife blade struck his heart, leading to immediate and fatal internal bleeding. His remains were interred in the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, New York.|$|E
25|$|At around 7:45 a.m., Chief Disario {{responded to}} a report about {{a man with a}} gun, later {{identified}} as Thomas Hartless. Arriving at the Pine Kirk Care Center, a local nurse home, Disario spotted Hartless in an <b>alley</b> <b>behind</b> the home, and issued a radio communication that he had spotted the gunman. According to Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, before shooting Disario, Hartless had taken two people hostage over an hour before to conceal his presence. Hartless and Disario engaged in a shootout that left Disario fatally wounded, while the two hostages escaped unharmed. Disario was found by responding deputies who pulled him to safety. He later died at a hospital.|$|E
25|$|McLain, {{suspended}} {{three times}} in 1970, was only 3-5 that season and was traded after the season was done. Mayo Smith was also let go after a disappointing fourth-place finish in 1970, {{to be replaced by}} Billy Martin. Following his playing career with the New York Yankees, Martin had worked in the Minnesota Twins organization, managing that team to an AL West Division title in 1969. But he was fired after that season due to rocky relationships with his players, which included a legendary fight with pitcher Dave Boswell in an <b>alley</b> <b>behind</b> Detroit's Lindell AC sports bar. He would spend the 1970 season out of baseball.|$|E
50|$|Those {{refugees}} from Saint-Domingue {{who thought they}} had immunity used the streets freely, but few other residents did. Those who had not escaped the city tried {{to wait out the}} epidemic in their homes. When the Mayor's Committee took a quick census of the dead, they found that the majority of victims were poor people, who died in homes located in the <b>alleys,</b> <b>behind</b> the main streets where most of the business of city was conducted.|$|R
50|$|In April 2007, the Baltimore City Council {{under the}} {{leadership}} of newly elected Mayor Shelia Dixon, passed the Gating and Greening Alleys ordinance, enabling Baltimore residents to legally gate and green the <b>alleys</b> <b>behind</b> their homes, contingent on a requirement that 80% of the homeowners on the alley submit consent forms and 100% of property owners to approve projects that impede traffic flow. Projects requiring 100% consent include removal of existing concrete and installation of permeable pavement and large tree plantings; beautification and smaller greening projects that do not impede traffic only require 80% approval.|$|R
50|$|Historians {{generally}} {{assert that}} rackets {{began as an}} 18th-century pastime in London's King's Bench and Fleet debtors prisons. The prisoners modified the game of fives by using tennis rackets {{to speed up the}} action. They played against the prison wall, sometimes at a corner to add a sidewall to the game. Rackets then became popular outside the prison, played in <b>alleys</b> <b>behind</b> pubs. It spread to schools, first using school walls, and later with proper four-wall courts being specially constructed for the game. The lithograph at right from the late 1700s shows school boys 'hitting up' outside the Harrow School 'Old School' buildings.|$|R
25|$|At 11 am on May 29, 2012, {{a package}} {{containing}} a left foot {{was delivered to}} the national headquarters of the Conservative Party of Canada. The package was stained with blood and had a foul smell. It was marked with a red heart symbol. Another package containing a left hand was intercepted in a Canada Post processing facility, addressed to the Liberal Party. A janitor discovered a decomposing torso inside a suitcase, left in a garbage pile in the <b>alley</b> <b>behind</b> an apartment building in the Snowdon area of Montreal.

25|$|Babe Ruth, who got {{his first}} hit as a Yankee at Shibe Park on April 14, 1920, hit a blast to deep left-center on September 9, 1921, that cleared the then-single {{bleacher}} stand, went across the street, and hit a tree over 500feet away. On May 21, 1930, Ruth hit one to right field over the 12-foot wall that landed in Opal Street, the <b>alley</b> <b>behind</b> the second row of houses, again over 500feet distant and {{said to be the}} longest ever home run hit at Shibe Park. The longest strike ever hit there is said to be Ted Williams's prodigious foul ball blast that cleared the high roof at the right field line, passed over 20th, over Opal, over Garnet, and came down on 19th Street.|$|E
25|$|McLain, {{suspended}} {{three times}} in 1970, was only 3-5 that season and was traded after the season was done. Mayo Smith was also let go after a disappointing fourth-place finish in 1970, {{to be replaced by}} Billy Martin. In a playing career that was primarily spent with the New York Yankees, Martin played his final games with the Minnesota Twins and stayed in that organization after his retirement. He managed the Twins to an AL West Division title in 1969, but was fired after that season due to rocky relationships with his players which included a legendary fight with pitcher Dave Boswell in an <b>alley</b> <b>behind</b> Detroit's Lindell AC sports bar.

5000|$|South Clintonville - South of North Broadway, {{housing stock}} {{is a mix}} of single and {{multiple}} family homes. The majority of these houses were built prior to 1930, and represent a variety of styles from basic American foursquare to other types of revival style architecture. The area is also home to many catalog (Sears, Montgomery Ward, Radford, etc.) kit homes. These neighborhoods were also initially developed as “streetcar” developments, the intention being that most residents would rely upon the High Street streetcar lines to travel to downtown Columbus. Garages for the earliest developed streets are accessed via <b>alleys</b> <b>behind</b> the properties.|$|R
60|$|Of {{course there}} was a whole state of things in the Boy's Town that the boys never knew of, or only knew by mistaken rumors and {{distorted}} glimpses. They had little idea of its politics, or commerce, or religion that was not wrong, and they only concerned themselves with persons and places so far as they expected to make use of them. But as they could make very little use of grown persons or public places, they kept away from them, and the Boy's Town was, for the most part, an affair of water-courses, and fields and woods, and the streets before the houses, and the <b>alleys</b> <b>behind</b> them.|$|R

25|$|The {{most notorious}} murder {{was that of}} Walter Liggett, the founder and editor of a weekly paper called The Midwest American. He had been {{threatened}} and offered bribes to stay quiet, but he persisted in reporting on links he found between organized crime figures and Minnesota's ruling Farmer-Labor Party. Liggett was beaten up, prosecuted for a non-existent rape incident, and finally died after being machine gunned in the <b>alley</b> <b>behind</b> his home on December 9, 1935. His wife and daughter witnessed the assassination as did several neighbors. All identified Kid Cann as the shooter. Kid Cann was indicted by a grand jury, but poor investigative work and a careless trial meant that he was acquitted. Liggett's widow would always believe that Minnesota Governor Floyd Olson was deeply implicated in the murder. Her husband had repeatedly accused the governor of corruption.|$|E
25|$|In 1911, the American Federation of Labor (AFL) {{called on}} Darrow {{to defend the}} McNamara brothers, John and James, who were charged with dynamiting the Los Angeles Times {{building}} on October 1, 1910, during the bitter struggle over the open shop in Southern California. Owing to a faulty timer, the bomb detonated prematurely, when the Times building was still occupied by employees. The bomb {{had been placed in}} an <b>alley</b> <b>behind</b> the building, and although the explosion itself did not bring the building down, it ignited nearby ink barrels and natural gas main lines. In the ensuing fire, 20 people were killed. The bombing {{is referred to as the}} Los Angeles Times bombing. The AFL appealed to local, state, regional and national unions to donate 25 cents per capita to the defense fund, and set up defense committees in larger cities throughout the nation to accept donations.|$|E
25|$|The Tigillum Sororium was a rite (sacrum) of the gens Horatia {{and later}} of the State. In it Janus Curiatius was {{associated}} to Juno Sororia: {{they had their}} altars {{on opposite sides of}} the <b>alley</b> <b>behind</b> the Tigillum Sororium. Physically this consisted of a beam spanning the space over two posts. It was kept in good condition down to the time of Livy at public expenses. According to tradition it was a rite of purification that served at the expiation of Publius Horatius who had murdered his own sister when he saw her mourning the death of her betrothed Curiatius. Dumézil has shown in his Les Horaces et les Curiaces that this story is in fact the historical transcription of rites of reintegration into civil life of the young warriors, in the myth symbolised by the hero, freed from their furor (wrath), indispensable at war but dangerous in social life. What is known of the rites of October 1 shows at Rome the legend has been used as an aetiological myth for the yearly purification ceremonies which allowed the desacralisation of soldiers at the end of the warring season, i.e. their cleansing from the religious pollution contracted at war. The story finds parallels in Irish and Indian mythologies. These rites took place in October, month that at Rome saw the celebration of the end of the yearly military activity. Janus would then the patron of the feria as god of transitions, Juno for her affinities to Janus, especially on the day of the kalendae. It is also possible though that she took part as the tutelary goddess of young people, the iuniores, etymologically identical to her. Modern scholars are divided on the interpretation of J. Curiatius and J. Sororia. Renard citing Capdeville opines that the wisest choice is to adhere to tradition and consider the legend itself as the source of the epithets.|$|E

500|$|The {{uncertainty}} {{over the future}} of the North Circular Road has blighted properties on and near it, particularly around Bounds Green. Around 1972, approximately 400 homes on the road were compulsory purchased by the Greater London Council in conjunction with widening schemes that were then cancelled. The properties have suffered from a lack of long-term care. [...] Since TfL took responsibility for the road, land for future schemes has been left dormant, resulting in urban decay with derelict properties. Compulsory purchased properties were let out to various short-term tenants, which led to them housing prostitutes and migrant workers living in increasing squalor. Pedestrians have become too frightened to use underpasses along the road, particularly to access North Middlesex Hospital. Areas close to the road, such as the <b>alleys</b> <b>behind</b> properties on the Telford Road section, have suffered from fly tipping and anti-social behaviour.|$|R

500|$|Detectives {{from the}} King County Sheriff's Office and the Seattle Police Department grew {{increasingly}} concerned. There {{was no significant}} physical evidence, and the missing women had little in common, apart from being young, attractive, white college students with long hair parted in the middle. On June 1, Brenda Carol Ball, 22, disappeared after leaving the Flame Tavern in Burien, Washington, near Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. She was last seen {{in the parking lot}} talking to a brown-haired man with his arm in a sling. In the early hours of June 11, UW student Georgann [...] Hawkins vanished while walking down a brightly lit alley between her boyfriend's dormitory residence and her sorority house. The next morning, three Seattle homicide detectives and a criminalist combed the entire alleyway on their hands and knees, finding nothing. After Hawkins's disappearance was publicized, witnesses came forward to report seeing a man that night in an <b>alley</b> <b>behind</b> a nearby dormitory, on crutches with a leg cast, struggling to carry a briefcase. One woman recalled that the man asked her to help him carry the case to his car, a light brown Volkswagen Beetle.|$|E
5000|$|Harbor Town is an upscale, new urbanist-style {{neighborhood}} in Memphis, Tennessee. Harbor Town sits atop 132 acres on a sandbar known as Mud Island. The neighborhood emphasizes the human, not the automobile, and interaction between neighbors is encouraged. It was the collaborative effort of Memphis native and downtown developer Henry Turley, RTKL of Baltimore, Looney, Ricks and Kiss architectural firm from Memphis and consultant, Tony Bologna. They made a simple book that plainly told [...] "do this and don't do that"- development guidelines that would grow Harbor Town {{into the kind}} of community now known as New Urbanism. Today, Harbor Town is dense and walkable, offering traditional row houses, contemporary homes, apartments, shops, restaurants, schools, parks, and a marina. It is much studied by city planners from all over the world.Today the trees are mature, the cars are tucked away into <b>alleys</b> <b>behind</b> houses, the river beckons, and the downtown core is a stones throw away.|$|R
60|$|It {{was still}} dark, but already {{there was a}} dim grey glimmer of dawn by which objects could be faintly discerned. Searching, Casanova found another door {{opposite}} that of the chamber which they had entered earlier. It was locked, but the lock was a poor one that yielded to half a dozen blows of the spontoon, and they passed into a little room beyond which by an open door they came into a long gallery lined with pigeon-holes stuffed with parchments, which they conceived to be the archives. At {{the end of this}} gallery they found a short flight of stairs, and below that yet another, which brought them to a glass door. Opening this, they entered a room which Casanova immediately identified as the ducal chancellery. Descent from one of its windows would have been easy, but they would have found themselves in the labyrinth of courts and <b>alleys</b> <b>behind</b> Saint Mark's, which would not have suited them at all.|$|R
60|$|The {{story of}} the encounter, even as it dribbled forth from Slocum, {{developed}} extenuating circumstances. Slocum was man grown, a big, muscular fellow, rather given to bullying. A heavy carriage whip was found lying in the alley, and this also supported Harold's story to his father. As told by Slocum, the struggle took place just where the <b>alley</b> from <b>behind</b> the parsonage came out upon the cross street.|$|R
500|$|At one point, the {{principal}} male characters congregate in an <b>alley</b> <b>behind</b> Johnny's apartment to play catch with a football while wearing tuxedos. When Mark arrives, he is revealed to have shaved his beard, {{and the camera}} slowly zooms in on his face while dramatic music plays on the soundtrack. Nothing that is said or occurs during the scene has any effect on the plot; the scene ends abruptly when the men decide to return to Johnny's apartment after Peter trips. Wiseau received enough questions about the scene {{that he decided to}} address it on a Q segment featured on the DVD release; rather than explaining the scene, though, Wiseau only states that playing football without the proper protective equipment is fun and challenging. Greg Sestero has been questioned about the significance of Mark's shaving, though his only response for several years was [...] "if people only knew." [...] Sestero describes in The Disaster Artist that Wiseau insisted he shave his beard on-set just so that Wiseau would have an excuse for Johnny to call Mark [...] "Babyface," [...] Wiseau's own nickname for Sestero, and that the revealing of beardless Mark would be [...] "a moment". Sestero further detailed how the football-in-tuxedos scene was concocted on set by Wiseau, who never explained the significance of the scene to the cast or crew and insisted that the sequence be filmed at the expense of other, relevant scenes.|$|E

Banks finds suspects galore, while Annie seems to hit a brick wall—until she reaches a breakthrough that spins her case in a shocking and surprising new direction, one that also involves Banks. Then another incident occurs in the Maze which seems to link the two cases in a bizarre and mysterious way. As Banks and Annie dig into the past to uncover the deeper connections, they find themselves also dealing with the emotional baggage and personal demons of their own relationship.
