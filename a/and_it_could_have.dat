5|$|Seeking {{to regain}} for himself the kingdom lost by his {{half-brother}} Olaf Haraldsson, Harald began his journey westwards in early 1045, departing from Novgorod (Holmgard) to Staraya Ladoga (Aldeigjuborg) where he obtained a ship. His journey went through Lake Ladoga, down the Neva River, {{and then into}} the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic Sea. He arrived in Sigtuna in Sweden, probably at the end of 1045 or in early 1046. When he arrived in Sweden, according to the skald Tjodolv Arnorsson, his ship was unbalanced by its heavy load of gold. In Harald's absence, the throne of Norway had been restored to Magnus the Good, an illegitimate son of Olaf. Harald may actually have known this, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been the reason why Harald wanted to return to Norway in the first place. Since Cnut the Great's sons had chosen to abandon Norway and instead fight over England, and his sons and successors Harold Harefoot and Harthacnut had died young, Magnus's position as king had been secured. No domestic threats or insurrections are recorded to have occurred during his eleven-year reign. After the death of Harthacnut, which had left the Danish throne vacant, Magnus had in addition been selected to be the king of Denmark, and managed to defeat the Danish royal pretender Sweyn Estridsson.|$|E

The chief {{investigator for the}} medical examiner stated that the original placement of the duct tape was unclear <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> shifted positions as he collected the remains. Cindy Anthony testified that their family buried their pets in blankets and plastic bags, using duct tape to seal the opening. Additionally, an FBI forensic document examiner {{found no evidence of}} a sticker or sticker residue on the duct tape found near the child's remains.|$|E
25|$|Gibraltar were humiliated by Canada: Abraham took 5-9 as the Gibraltarians were {{dismissed}} for 46, the lowest total of the tournament, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been worse {{as they were}} 17/7 at one point. In reply the Canadians smashed 48 from just 23 balls to record the easiest of ten-wicket wins. CAC Browne made 57 as Fiji posted a competitive total of 251 against the United States, but an unbeaten 104 by Lashkari and 74 from Kamran Rasheed ensured a five-wicket win for the Americans. The Dutch put on 200 for the second wicket against Hong Kong (Atkinson 107, Gomes 101) and their opponents could only manage 157/9 from their allotted overs. Finally, Harry made 162 and Maha 52 as Papua New Guinea (377/6) destroyed Israel (100); Amini took 5-19 for the Papuans.|$|E

500|$|Enpassant (from [...] ) is a move in chess. It is {{a special}} pawn [...] that can only occur {{immediately}} after a pawn makes a double-step move from its starting square, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been captured by an enemy pawn had it advanced only one square. The opponent captures the just-moved pawn [...] "asitpasses" [...] through the first square. The result {{is the same as}} if the pawn had advanced only one square and the enemy pawn had captured it normally.|$|E
500|$|Jordan Levin from The Miami Herald {{called the}} {{performance}} [...] "gutsy", and labeled it as [...] "an anthem for [...] and pop music".

[...] "Turn Up the Radio" [...] was also the opening song for Madonna's one-stop performance for 45 minutes at Paris' Olympia music hall. The performance of the song at the November 19–20, 2012, shows in Miami, at the American Airlines Arena were recorded and released in Madonna's fourth live album, MDNA World Tour.|$|E
500|$|There was a {{significant}} development at Maidstone on Saturday, 28 March 1668 when the quarter sessions made a ruling that customs and excise could not claim excise duty on alcoholic drinks sold at a [...] "kricketing"; it was further ruled that a match promoter {{had the right to}} sell ale to spectators, presumably after obtaining the necessary licence. As John Major suggested, this dealt a massive blow to [...] "Puritan morality", <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been the beginning of the long-term relationship between sport and alcohol. Derek Birley's comment on the excise ruling was that cricket's [...] "connection with public houses is historic {{in every sense of the}} word". In his view, the sport had [...] "arrived" [...] because the brewery trade was the earliest and strongest sponsor of popular sport.|$|E

500|$|Heading {{the cast}} of Doppelgänger is Roy Thinnes {{in the role of}} Colonel Glenn Ross of NASA. Anderson, who {{perceived}} a likeness to fellow American actor Paul Newman, cast Thinnes as the male lead after viewing his performance in the television series The Invaders (1967–68). In the Andersons' draft script, Ross's first name is Stewart, and he {{is said to have been}} the first man to walk on Mars. In a 2008 interview, Thinnes said, [...] "I thought [...] was an interesting premise, although now we know that there isn't another planet on the other side of the Sun, through our space exploration and telescopic abilities. But at that time it was conceivable, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been scary." [...] To conform to the script's characterisation of Ross, and to the detriment of his respiratory health, Thinnes ended up smoking many packets' worth of cigarettes in the course of the production. Reporting on Thinnes' intention to demand a non-smoking clause in his next film contract, in September 1969 Australian newspaper The Age stated, [...] "He smokes about two packets a day, but the perpetual lighting up of new cigarettes for continuity purposes was too much." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cohn had a {{reputation}} as a taskmaster, but he had his own criticisms of Hayworth. He had invested heavily in her before she began a reckless affair with the married Aly Khan, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> caused a backlash against her career and Columbia's success. For instance, an article in the British periodical The People called for a boycott of Hayworth's films: [...] "Hollywood must be told its already tarnished reputation will sink to rock bottom if it restores this reckless woman to a place among its stars." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2012, the WJC {{president}} criticized Austrian politicians {{for failing}} to publicly denounce {{the leader of the}} third-largest political party in the country, the FPÖ, Heinz-Christian Strache, who had posted an anti-Semitic cartoon on his Facebook page. [...] "Clearly, and not for the first time, the FPÖ leader is trying to whip up anti-Semitic sentiment. His repeated denials are not credible because his words and actions speak for themselves," [...] Ronald Lauder said in a statement, adding: [...] "This scandal shows that anti-Jewish resentment is still widespread, and unscrupulous politicians are allowed to exploit it for electioneering purposes. That is mind-boggling, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> negative repercussions for Austrian Jews." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the post-Civil War period (after 1865), African Americans {{were able}} to obtain surplus {{military}} bass drums, snare drums and fifes, and an original African-American drum and fife music emerged, featuring tresillo and related syncopated rhythmic figures. This was a drumming tradition that was distinct from its Caribbean counterparts, expressing a uniquely African-American sensibility. [...] "The snare and bass drummers played syncopated cross-rhythms," [...] observed the writer Robert Palmer (writer), speculating that [...] "this tradition must have dated back to {{the latter half of}} the nineteenth century, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> not have developed in the first place if there hadn't been a reservoir of polyrhythmic sophistication in the culture it nurtured." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 13, 2010, T.I. {{convinced}} Joshua Starks, a 24-year-old suicidal man in Atlanta, not to {{jump from}} a 22-story building. After hearing of {{the situation on the}} radio, he drove to the scene at the 400 Colony Square Building and asked police if he could help. T.I. then talked to the man, and convinced him not to jump. Afterwards, T.I. stated [...] "For one, I'm not taking any credit. I didn't do it... I could've just as well came down there <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been resolved in another way. The {{fact of the matter is}} that God put me in a position to help, and I can't take any credit for that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Simon Poidevin in For Love Not Money writes that, [...] "At halftime we {{were leading}} 15-12 <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been 21-12 if a try equal in skill and drama to the Campese try at Wellington hadn't been {{disallowed}} for a forward pass." [...] Bob Dwyer in The Winning Way asserts the disallowed try could have cost Australia the Test, writing that, [...] "Towards {{the end of}} the first half Steve Williams went over the line at the end of a movement which had begun at the far end of the field, but the referee ruled there had been a forward pass three or four players earlier. That try, if converted, would have taken us to a lead of 18 to 6 and, I think, could have been the winning of the match.|$|E

2500|$|Fulham's {{competition}} {{began with}} a trip to fellow Southern Division outfit Newport County. Having already beaten Newport 140 in the league, Fulham this time ran 12 unanswered goals past their hapless opponents. [...] "The final score was 120 <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been more," [...] noted the match report on the Fulham website. In the fourth round Fulham faced a trickier assignment at Birmingham City. Under the leadership of Queens Park Rangers player Marcus Bignot, Birmingham City's young team were top of the Northern Division and had already beaten Doncaster Belles {{to qualify for the}} Premier League Cup final, where they would meet Fulham. One goal ahead at half time, Fulham's superior fitness and Marianne Pettersen's eighth hat-trick of the season resulted in a 50 win. Bignot lamented [...] "our girls were overawed [...] they were waiting for Fulham to score." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{article titled}} [...] "The Hillary Doctrine", {{published}} in The Atlantic in January 2013 by journalist David Rohde, {{talks about the}} terms of exchanges between Clinton and other American politicians within discussions of dilemmas concerning the United States and certain African countries. This time, Clinton explicitly called out actions taken by the United States abroad, and argued that, contrary to popular belief, [...] "a lot of the challenges we face are not immediately – or sustainably – solved by military action alone." [...] Further, while the aforementioned doctrine focuses on populations, such as women and children, that are typically ignored within discussions of national security, Clinton also makes an effort to push for including places that have historically been ignored within national security discussions, as well. However, Rohde never mentions the phrase [...] "Hillary Doctrine" [...] in the piece, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been {{the creation of the}} magazine's headline writer.|$|E
2500|$|In court, the Crown {{contended that}} Truscott and Harper left the County Road before {{reaching}} the bridge over the Bayfield River and, in a wooded area beside the County Road (known as Lawson's Bush), Truscott raped and murdered Lynne. Truscott has maintained since 1959 that he took Harper to {{the intersection of the}} County Road and Highway 8, where he left her unharmed. Truscott maintains that {{when he arrived at the}} bridge, he looked back toward the intersection where he had dropped Harper off and observed that a vehicle had stopped and that she was in the process of entering it. On June 10, 1959 at 9:30a.m. Steven was interviewed by (Constable) Hobbs in a cruiser at his school. He told Hobbs that while standing on the bridge, he saw Lynne get into a [...] "late model Chevrolet" [...] and there [...] "was a lot of chrome on the car <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been a Bellair [...] version." [...] At 11:20 that evening, Lynne's father reported her missing.|$|E

2500|$|The film {{received}} positive reviews upon {{release and}} currently holds a 91% [...] "Fresh" [...] rating {{on the website}} Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 7.7/10. Roger Ebert gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, writing that the film [...] "provides a good time, high style, a loving salute to an earlier period of filmmaking". The New York Times chief critic of the era, Vincent Canby, pointed out that [...] "had Dame Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express been made into a movie 40 years ago (when it was published here as [...] "Murder on the Calais Coach"), it would have been photographed in black-and-white on a back lot in Burbank or Culver City, with one or two stars and a dozen character actors and studio contract players. Its running time would have been around 67 minutes <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been a very respectable B-picture. Murder on the Orient Express wasn't made into a movie 40 years ago, and after you see the Sidney Lumet production that opened yesterday at the Coronet, you may be both surprised and glad it wasn't. An earlier adaptation could have interfered with plans to produce this terrifically entertaining super-valentine to a kind of whodunit that may well be one of the last fixed points in our inflationary universe." ...|$|E
2500|$|Both Luke Wadding and the Four Masters (who {{refer to}} Ross Errilly in their Annals as Ros-Oirbhealagh) record that the abbey {{was founded in}} 1351, but this date has been called into {{question}} by numerous historians. [...] Architectural cues and documentary evidence {{have given rise to}} a modern consensus that the friary was founded sometime {{in the middle of the}} 15th century, perhaps around 1460. The earliest existing documentary evidence however comes from a reference to the friary in the will of Galway man John Blake, son of Henry, who bequeathed the sum of 40 pence to the friary in 1469 but on the other hand some facts in support of the legend on the founding of the friary in 1351 cannot be overlooked. Firstly history tells us that there was a plague - the [...] "Black Death" [...] rampant in the country in 1348 and succeeding years, secondly, Archbishop MacHugh, who is credited with the foundation of the friary, was the metropolitan in Tuam, he was a franciscan and a native of the Headford area and he died of the plague in 1349 <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> taken three years to build the first part of the friary owing to the prevalence of the plague and the marshy condition of the soil. In any case, it is clear from the architectural evidence that any religious building that may have been on the site prior to that time was greatly expanded during the 15th century. Around 1473, a delegation of Franciscans from Ross Errilly went to Donegal at the request of the Tyrconnell clan and founded the Donegal Friary, where the Four Masters would later write their famous Annals.|$|E
