It was quickly realised that Magna Carta stood in the same relation to the King-in-Parliament as it had to the King without Parliament. This supremacy would be challenged {{by the likes of}} Granville Sharp. Sharp regarded Magna Carta as a fundamental part of the constitution, and maintained that it would be treason to repeal <b>any</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> He also held that the Charter prohibited slavery.|$|E

25|$|Pattern {{completion}} is {{the ability}} to recall an entire memory from a partial or degraded sensory cue. Place cells are able to maintain a stable firing field even after significant signals are removed from a location, suggesting that they can recall a pattern from only some of the original input. Furthermore, pattern completion can be symmetric in that an entire memory can be retrieved from <b>any</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> For example, in an object-place association memory, spatial context can be used to recall an object and the object can be used to recall the spatial context.|$|E

As a result, Manny Ramirez went to the Los Angeles Dodgers in a three-way trade involving the Pittsburgh Pirates. The trade brought Jason Bay to the Red Sox.

Is it possible that a person of classical education have so slight an opinion of (perhaps) the most arduous effort of human invention, as to suffer the fervour and confidence of youth to hurry him in such a manner through a design which may fix the reputation of a whole life?" [...] The review continued: [...] "To proceed to the execution of the design: we do not hesitate to declare our opinion that the poetical powers displayed in it are of a very superior kind, and such as, if not wasted in premature and negligent exertions, promise a rich harvest of future excellence. Conceptions more lofty and daring, sentiments more commanding, and language more energetic than some of the best passages in this poem afford, will not easily be found:—nor does scarcely <b>any</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> sink to languor; as the glow of feeling and genius animates the whole." ...|$|E

If they cannot interpret {{the current state of the}} power grid in such an event, they follow a contingency plan, contacting other plant and grid operators by telephone if necessary.
