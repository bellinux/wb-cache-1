40|$|LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) {{directly}} measures canopy vertical structures, {{and provides}} an effective remote sensing solution to accurate and spatiallyexplicit mapping of forest characteristics, such as canopy height and Leaf Area Index. However, many factors, such as large data volume and high costs for data acquisition, precludes the operational and practical use of most currently available LiDARs for frequent and large-scale mapping. At the same time, a growing need is arising for realtime remote sensing platforms, e. g., to provide timely information for urgent applications. This study aims {{to develop an}} <b>airborne</b> <b>profiling</b> LiDAR system, featured with on-the-fly data processing, for near real- or real- time forest inventory. The development of such a system involves implementing the on-board data processing and analysis as well as building useful regression-based models to relate LiDAR measurements with forest biophysical parameters. This work established a paradigm for an on-the-fly <b>airborne</b> <b>profiling</b> LiDAR system to inventory regional forest resources in real- or near real- time. The system was developed based on an existing portable airborne laser system (PALS) that has been previously assembled at NASA by Dr. Ross Nelson. Key issues in automating PALS as an on-the-fly system were addressed, including the design of an archetype for the system workflow, the development of efficient and robust algorithms for automatic data processing and analysis, the development of effective regression models to predict forest biophysical parameters from LiDAR measurements, and the implementation of an integrated software package to incorporate all the above development. This work exploited the untouched potential of airborne laser profilers for realtime forest inventory, and therefore, documented an initial step toward developing airborne-laser-based, on-the-fly, real-time, forest inventory systems. Results from this work demonstrated the utility and effectiveness of <b>airborne</b> scanning or <b>profiling</b> laser systems for remotely measuring various forest structural attributes at a range of scales, i. e., from individual tree, plot, stand and up to regional levels.

40|$|AbstractThe {{ability to}} use digital {{remotely}} sensed data for forest inventory is often limited {{by the nature of}} the measures, which, with the exception of multi-angular or stereo observations, are largely insensitive to vertically distributed attributes.

Lidar (light detection and ranging) has emerged as a robust means to collect and subsequently characterize vertically distributed attributes. Lidar has been established as an appropriate data source for forest inventory purposes; however, large area monitoring and mapping activities with lidar remain challenging due to the logistics, costs, and data volumes involved.

This paper investigates the potential of using fractal dimension for quantifying texture and highlighting textural contrasts in <b>airborne</b> magnetic data. <b>Profiles</b> have been created by combining theoretical data with fractal dimensions (FD) of 1. 1, 1. 3 and 1. 5. Estimates of FD using the semi-variogram and variation methods clearly distinguish between sections of the profiles with different theoretical FD. Fractal dimension estimates made on a real <b>airborne</b> magnetic <b>profile,</b> using the variation method, clearly define two regions of visible textural contrast. A series of other variations in the estimated FD suggests that the method is able to resolve subtle contrasts that are not easily detected visually. The semi-variogram method of FD estimation is not able to resolve the obvious textural contrasts in real data, a result that is perhaps due to the stochastic nature of this methodology. The variation method has been used to estimate FD on a series of <b>airborne</b> magnetic <b>profiles.</b> This profile data was then gridded to generate an image of FD that moderately improves structural resolution.

The Cu clouds range in depth between; 500 and 6000 m and are generally nonprecipitating. They were sampled on board the University of Wyoming King Air over a mountain in southern Arizona during the summer monsoon, and over the high plains of southeastern Wyoming. The composite analysis shows clear evidence of an updraft/downdraft dipole in the upper cloud half, consistent with a horizontal vortex ring. A single cloud-scale toroidal circulation emerges notwith-standing the complex finescale structure with multiple vortices, commonly evident in individual transects of Cu clouds. The stratification of all Cu samples as a function of their buoyancy and mean vertical velocity shows that the vortex ring pattern tends to be more pronounced in positively buoyant Cu with rising motion (presumably young clouds) than in negatively buoyant and/or sinking Cu near the end of their life cycle.

In areas of high slope, cross-track errors result in measured elevation change that combines surface slope and the actual Δz/Δt signal. Slope corrections are particularly important in coastal ice streams, which often exhibit both rapidly changing elevations and high surface slopes.

This randomised, crossover, open-label study evaluated {{the proportion of}} patients making predefined serious errors with Pulmojet compared with Diskus and Turbohaler dry powder inhalers. Methods: Patients ≥ 18 years old with asthma and/or COPD who were current users of an inhaler but naïve to the study devices were assigned to inhaler technique assessment on Pulmojet and either Diskus or Turbohaler in a randomised order. Patients inhaled through empty devices after reading the patient information leaflet. If serious errors potentially affecting dose delivery were recorded, they repeated the inhalations after watching a training video. Inhaler technique was assessed by a trained nurse observer and an electronic inhalation <b>profile</b> <b>recorder.</b> Results: Baseline patient characteristics were similar between randomisation arms for the Pulmojet-Diskus (n = 277) and Pulmojet-Turbohaler (n = 144) comparisons. Non-inferiority in the proportions of patients recording no nurse-observed serious errors was demonstrated for both Pulmojet versus Diskus, and Pulmojet versus Turbohaler; therefore, superiority was tested. Patients were {{significantly less likely to}} make ≥ 1 nurse-observed serious errors using Pulmojet compared with Diskus (odds ratio, 0. 31; 95 % CI, 0. 19 – 0. 51) or Pulmojet compared with Turbohaler (0. 23; 0. 12 – 0. 44) after reading the patient information leaflet with additional video instruction, if required.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Subsurface {{profiles}} {{were obtained}} during airborne and surface short-pulse radar surveys along a winter roadway over the k a n a River near Fairbanks, Alaska. The roadway crossed ice-covered channels and intervening frozen channel bars. The <b>airborne</b> <b>profiles</b> were intended for ice thickness profiling but also revealed sporadic reflections from a deeper horizon beneath the bars. Later profiling {{from the surface}} recorded these deeper reflecting horizons in detail, and they were found to correspond with the base of seasonal frost, measured in drill holes. The sediments immediately beneath e frozen material were saturated and represented {{the top of a}} seasonally variable groundwater table confined and controlled by frost penetration. The profiles made from the surface also revealed reflections {{from the bottom of the}} ice and the channel bottom. However, no significant reflections were observed beneath the channel bottom; reflections from sloping horizons above and below the base of the frost in the bar may indicate alluvial bedding patterns in these deposits. Eleven holes were drilled along the roadway to determine ice thickness, water depth, frost depth and the depth to the river ice-alluvium contact. Wide-angle reflection and refraction soundings were also made to determine electrical properties of materials and to verify our depth interpretations from echo times. These observations indicate that the airborne technique provides an effective method of locating unfrozen channels and measuring the depth of frost penetration beneath bars.

40|$|In 2012 {{the need}} arose to {{determine}} {{the performance of the}} Eurofighter’s air data system by means of tower fly‐bys under very strict regulations and with a significant number of aircraft – namely the whole German fleet. It was evident right away that it was not feasible to perform all tests at the test center in Manching without creating a logistic nightmare and a heavy interference with the squad-ron’s schedule. As a consequence, it was decided to go where no one has gone before and perform these delicate tests with operational pilots and in the four Eurofighter squadrons. The implementation of the flight test technique was a common effort of the German Eurofighter National Support Center (NSC EF), the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the German Test Center (WTD 61). The inte-gration into the squadrons led to several technical and organisational challenges – such as the ques-tion how adequate data can be collected without flight test instrumentation and without the infra-structure and the procedures of a test center. The challenges led to many creative solutions. One ex-ample is the geometric height of the aircraft during the tower fly‐by above the static pressure refer-ence. This parameter was determined based on a mixture of a Flight <b>Profile</b> <b>Recorder</b> (FPR) GPS signal for the aircraft position combined with RADAR altimeter data and precision DGPS measure-ments of the equipment’s position on the control tower. A detailed map of the runway height above the WGS 84 ellipsoid enabled the elimination of potential runway slope-induced biases.

Circumpolar tree canopy cover (TCC) throughout the ecotone was derived by averaging MODIS VCF data from 2000 to 2005 and adjusting the averaged values using linear equations relating MODIS TCC to Quickbird-derived tree cover estimates. The adjustment helped mitigate VCF's overestimation of tree cover in lightly forested regions. An image segmentation procedure {{was used to}} group pixels representing similar tree cover into polygonal features (segmentation objects) that form {{the map of the}} transition zone. Each polygon represents an area much larger than the 500 m MODIS pixel and characterizes the patterns of sparse forest patches on a regional scale. Those polygons near the boreal/tundra interface with either (1) mean adjusted TCC values from 5 to 20 %, or (2) mean adjusted TCC values greater than 5 % but with a standard deviation less than 5 % were used to identify the ecotone.
