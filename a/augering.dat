Depending on the equipment available, {{it may not be}} technically feasible to exceed a certain height of highwall.

25|$|An augercast pile, often {{known as}} a {{continuous}} flight <b>augering</b> (CFA) pile, is formed by drilling into {{the ground with a}} hollow stemmed continuous flight auger to the required depth or degree of resistance. No casing is required. A cement grout mix is then pumped down the stem of the auger. While the cement grout is pumped, the auger is slowly withdrawn, conveying the soil upward along the flights. A shaft of fluid cement grout is formed to ground level. Reinforcement can be installed. Recent innovations in addition to stringent quality control allows reinforcing cages to be placed up to the full length of a pile when required. A typical reinforcing cage will consist of 4 to 8 bars from #5 to #8 bars typically 1/3 the length of the pile with longitudinal circular ties spaced {{along the length of the}} cage. Where tension loads are present it is typical to see a single full length bar placed at the center of each pile.|$|E

50|$|Ice cores are {{collected}} by cutting around a cylinder {{of ice in}} such a way as to enable it to be brought to the surface. Early cores were often collected with hand <b>augers,</b> and this is still done today for short holes. The design of ice core <b>augers</b> has changed little since 1932, when a design was patented with the same features that are in use today. An auger is essentially a cylinder with helical metal ribs (known as flights) wrapped around the outside, and cutting blades at the lower end of the ribs. Hand <b>augers</b> can be rotated by a T handle or a brace handle; some <b>augers</b> are designed to be attached to handheld electric drills to power the rotation. With the aid of a tripod to assist in lowering and raising the auger, cores up to 50 m deep can be retrieved, but the practical limit is about 30 m for engine-powered <b>augers,</b> and less for hand <b>augers.</b> Below this depth, electromechanical or thermal drills are used.|$|R

50|$|At {{the same}} time, Zheng {{and her team}} {{conducted}} surveys of the area north of Xiaotun Village, taking cores from the soil using <b>augering</b> devices known as Luoyang spades. They found ancient architecture and tamped earth, which prevented local work teams from levelling the hill. Zheng believed {{there was also a}} tomb beneath the tamped earth, which the majority of her peers disagreed with. In 1976, excavations were conducted on an area approximately 1,000m². They unearthed 46 sets of foundations, 165 ash pits, and 54 burials - the most important of which was the tomb of Wu Ding's consort and general, Fuhao. Fuhao's tomb was extremely well preserved, and, in contrast to other tombs, had not been robbed. There was a huge number of grave goods, including bronzes, jades, precious stones, ivory, as well as a total of 1,928 bone artefacts and more than 7,000 seashells. Bronze artefacts included 468 ritual vessels and weapons. Of the 210 ritual vessles, 190 were engraved with characters and Fuhao's name was on 109 of them. Zheng identified the characters Fuhao as referring to the prominent individual mentioned in the oracle bones of the Wu Ding period as presiding over rituals and leading soldiers into battle.|$|E

5000|$|The huge main {{plant for}} Hughes Tool located in Houston, Texas, {{fronting}} Harrisburg Blvd., {{had grown to}} be one of the biggest oil tool manufacturers in the World. It had the latest, largest, and most automated equipment for foundries, forging, heat treating, and machining anywhere. At its peak during the Texas Oil Boom, it was a center for manufacturing, design, research, metallurgy, and engineering for oil field technologies. This included the drill bit (well) and tool joint product lines critical for oil and gas drilling, some of the first technologies for ram blast bits for drilling in mines, geothermal drilling, and a hydraulic powered jackhammer known as the Hughes Impactor. It also manufactured a line of truck and crane-mounted earth <b>augering</b> machines ("diggers") that were most commonly used to produce holes up to a depth of about 120 ft for building and bridge foundations. It even had a fully functioning drilling simulator inside its main research lab where production or prototype drill bits could be tested on any kind of rock at temperatures and pressures normally encountered in actual drilling operations. In 1972, Howard Hughes sold the Hughes Tool Company; it had been the consistently profitable part of his empire, and produced the profits that built all the rest from the very beginning. This became the [...] "new" [...] Hughes Tool Company while the remaining divisions of the business were placed in a new holding company, the Summa Corporation.|$|E
50|$|A {{geological}} survey is the systematic {{investigation of the}} geology beneath a given piece of ground {{for the purpose of}} creating a geological map or model. Geological surveying employs techniques from the traditional walk-over survey, studying outcrops and landforms, to intrusive methods, such as hand <b>augering</b> and machine-driven boreholes, to the use of geophysical techniques and remote sensing methods, such as aerial photography and satellite imagery. Such surveys may be undertaken by state, province, or national {{geological survey}} organizations to maintain the geological inventory and advance the knowledge of geosciences {{for the benefit of the}} nation.A geological survey map typically superimposes the surveyed extent and boundaries of geological units on a topographic map, together with information at points (such as measurements of orientation of bedding planes) and lines (such as the intersection of faults with the land surface). The maps and reports created by geological survey organisations generally aim for geographic continuity and completeness in establishing the spatial patterns of near-surface rock units. The map may include cross sections to illustrate the three-dimensional interpretation. Subsurface geological and geophysical maps, providing limited coverage of deeper geology (known, for example, from drilling for oil or gas), are maintained internally by major oil companies and regulators. Some geological survey organisations have collaborated with them to include subsurface geology in their systematic surveys, for example, the Geological Atlas of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin. Subsurface maps typically depict the three-dimensional form of geological surfaces by means of contours and cross sections. Computer-based models are increasingly used to provide more comprehensive information storage and greater flexibility of presentation.In the United States, the 50 state surveys are coordinated by the Association of American State Geologists.|$|E

Basic field methods included <b>augering</b> and in-field soil analysis of physical properties. The <b>augering</b> resulted in reconstruction of the stratigraphic sequence in the study site.
