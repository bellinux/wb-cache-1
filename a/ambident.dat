Consecutive analysis of various types of <b>ambident</b> organic system reveals that an older approach based on thermodynamic/kinetic control describes reactivity of organic compounds perfectly, while the HSAB principle actually fails and should be abandoned in the rationalization of <b>ambident</b> reactivity of organic compounds.|$|E

50|$|The Kolbe nitrile {{synthesis}} is {{a method}} for the preparation of alkyl nitriles by reaction of the corresponding alkyl halide with a metal cyanide. A side product for this reaction is {{the formation of an}} isonitrile because the cyanide ion is an <b>ambident</b> nucleophile and according to Kornblum's rule is capable of reacting with either carbon or nitrogen. The reaction is named after Hermann Kolbe.|$|E

For example, the thiocyanate ion (SCN−) may attack from either the [...] or the [...] For this reason, the SN2 reaction of an alkyl halide with SCN− often leads to a mixture of RSCN (an alkyl thiocyanate) and RNCS (an alkyl isothiocyanate).

5000|$|An {{application}} of HSAB theory {{is the so-called}} Kornblum's rule (after Nathan Kornblum) which states that in reactions with <b>ambident</b> nucleophiles (nucleophiles that can attack from two or more places), the more electronegative atom reacts when the reaction mechanism is SN1 and the less electronegative one in a SN2 reaction. This rule (established in 1954) [...] predates HSAB theory but in HSAB terms its explanation {{is that in a}} SN1 reaction the carbocation (a hard acid) reacts with a hard base (high electronegativity) and that in a SN2 reaction tetravalent carbon (a soft acid) reacts with soft bases.|$|E

40|$|The {{alkylation}} of the <b>ambident</b> enolates of a methyl glycinate Schiff {{base with}} ethyl chloride was studied at B 3 LYP and MP 2 levels with 6 - 31 +G * basis set. The free (E) -enolates and (Z) -enolate {{are similar in}} energy and geometry. The transition states for the alkylation of the free (E) /(Z) -enolate with ethyl chloride have similar energy barriers of ~ 13 kcal/mol. However, with a lithium ion, the (E) -enolate behaves as an <b>ambident</b> enolate and makes a cyclic lithium-complex in bidentate pattern which is more stable by 11 - 23 kcal/mol than the (Z) -enolate-lithium complexes. And the TS for the alkylation of (E) -enolate-lithium complex coordinated with one methyl ether is lower in energy than those from (Z) -enolate-lithium complexes by 4. 3 - 7. 3 kcal/mol. Further solvation model (SCRF-CPCM) and reaction coordinate (IRC) were studied. This theoretical study suggests that the alkylation of <b>ambident</b> enolates proceeds with stable cyclic bidentate complexes {{in the presence of}} metal ion and solvent.
