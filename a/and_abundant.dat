5|$|C. b. macrorhynchus, {{given the}} name great-billed {{cockatoo}} by Mathews, is found across northern Australia.

5|$|As both {{scientists}} discovered thallium {{independently and}} {{a large part of}} the work, especially the isolation of the metallic thallium was done by Lamy, Crookes tried to secure his priority on the work. Lamy was awarded a medal at the International Exhibition in London 1862: For the discovery of a new <b>and</b> <b>abundant</b> source of thallium and after heavy protest Crookes also received a medal: thallium, for the discovery of the new element. The controversy between both scientists continued through 1862 and 1863. Most of the discussion ended after Crookes was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1863.|$|E

5|$|Because of its numbers, ubiquity, and {{association}} with human settlements, the house sparrow is culturally prominent. It is extensively, and usually unsuccessfully, persecuted as an agricultural pest. It has also often been kept as a pet, {{as well as}} being a food item and a symbol of lust, sexual potency, commonness, and vulgarity. Though it is widespread <b>and</b> <b>abundant,</b> its numbers have declined in some areas. The animal's conservation status is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E

5|$|It has a humid {{subtropical}} climate (Cfa {{according to the}} Köppen climate classification). whose main features are high temperatures <b>and</b> <b>abundant</b> rainfall throughout the year. This year-round rainfall occurs {{because most of the}} region lies north of the subtropical high pressure belt even in winter, exposing it to moist easterly winds from the Atlantic Ocean throughout the year. Water deficiencies and extended periods of drought are uncommon, and much of the region has a positive water balance (i.e. the precipitation exceeds the potential evapotranspiration).|$|E

Majungasaurus was the apex predator in its ecosystem, mainly preying on sauropods like Rapetosaurus, and {{is also one of the}} few dinosaurs for which there is direct evidence of cannibalism.|$|E

5|$|Mycena californiensis is {{a species}} of fungus in the Mycenaceae family. It is a common <b>and</b> <b>abundant</b> species in the coastal oak {{woodlands}} of California, where it grows saprobically, feeding on the fallen leaves and acorns of various oak species. First described in 1860 by Berkeley and Curtis, the species was collected four years earlier during an exploring and surveying expedition. It was subsequently considered a doubtful species by later Mycena researchers, until a 1999 publication validated the taxon. Mycena elegantula is considered a synonym.|$|E

5|$|Pulveroboletus ravenelii {{produces}} an olive-grey to olive-brown spore print. Spores are elliptical to oval, smooth, and measure 8–10 by 4–5μm. The hyphal {{tissue in the}} hymenophore is inamyloid and bilateral, meaning it diverges downward from the flesh {{toward the edge of}} the hymenophore, away from a central strand. The tubes have scattered cystidia on the walls (pleurocystidia) <b>and</b> <b>abundant</b> cystidia on the edges (cheilocystidia). The hyphae in the cap cuticle are arranged as an ixotrichodermium–long and typically multi-celled, with erect hyphae embedded in a gelatinous matrix. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|The smooth toadfish (Tetractenos glaber) is {{a species}} of fish in the {{pufferfish}} family Tetraodontidae. It is native to shallow coastal and estuarine waters of southeastern Australia, where it is widespread <b>and</b> <b>abundant.</b> French naturalist Christophe-Paulin de La Poix de Fréminville described the species in 1813, though early records confused it with its close relative, the common toadfish (T. hamiltonii). The two are the only members of the genus Tetractenos after going through several taxonomic changes since discovery.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} the only {{remaining}} native parrot in Puerto Rico and has been listed as critically endangered by the World Conservation Union since 1994. Once widespread <b>and</b> <b>abundant,</b> the population declined drastically in the 19th and early 20th centuries with the removal of most of its native habitat; the species completely vanished from Vieques and Mona Island, nearby to the main island of Puerto Rico. Conservation efforts commenced in 1968 to save the bird from extinction. In 2012, the total estimated population was 58–80 individuals in the wild and over 300 individuals in captivity.|$|E

5|$|A later {{branch of}} the Yamashiro tradition, was the Hasebe school which {{was active in the}} Nanboku-chō period and early Muromachi period.

The sugata is characterized by a wide mihaba, thin kasane and shallow sori. The jihada is fine itame-hada mixed with masame-hada, chikei <b>and</b> <b>abundant</b> ji-nie. The hamon is of irregular width, narrow and small-patterned at the bottom and wide and large-patterned at the top of the blade. There are many tobiyaki and hitatsura as well as rough nie.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{evidence}} that cognitive deficits remain stable over time is reliable <b>and</b> <b>abundant,</b> {{much of the research}} in this domain focuses on methods to improve attention and working memory. Efforts to improve learning ability in individuals with schizophrenia using a high- versus low-reward condition and an instruction-absent or instruction-present condition revealed that increasing reward leads to poorer performance while providing instruction leads to improved performance, highlighting that some treatments may exist to increase cognitive performance. Training individuals with schizophrenia to alter their thinking, attention, and language behaviors by verbalizing tasks, engaging in cognitive rehearsal, giving self-instructions, giving coping statements to the self to handle failure, and providing self-reinforcement for success, significantly improves performance on recall tasks. This type of training, known as self-instructional (SI) training, produced benefits such as lower number of nonsense verbalizations and improved recall while distracted.|$|E
