5|$|Mitchell {{was born}} on April 23, 1977, to Reid and Nadija Mitchell. He has a sister named Chantal. His father works as <b>a</b> <b>heavy-duty</b> {{mechanic}} with Western Forest Products, while his mother is a Croatian-born immigrant {{who works as a}} terminal service agent for B.C. Ferries. Mitchell's grandfather, Les Mitchell, played amateur senior hockey and once earned a tryout with the New York Rangers during the Original Six-era. His grandfather, Les, scored the championship-winning goal for the Nanaimo Clippers in 1945. He said Les Mitchell was the last person to skate on the ice at the Civic Arena in Nanaimo before it was torn down.|$|E
25|$|The {{firmness}} of the suspension, {{and thus}} {{the quality of the}} ride, was gradually softened through the years as well, hinting at what Toronado eventually would become in 1971. Interestingly, <b>a</b> <b>heavy-duty</b> suspension was offered optionally on later first generation Toronados, which included the original torsion bar springs that were used on the 1966.|$|E

25|$|The Horse Emporium {{was once}} the mill's canteen block. The {{displays}} are arranged {{on the theme of}} horse power. Among other exhibits there is <b>a</b> <b>heavy-duty</b> British Railways dray, a decorative chaff cutter and a horse fodder measure. There is a saddler-at-work display, plus horse brasses, horseshoes and other harness. In a stable there is a blacksmith's workshop and farriery display, complete with many horseshoes, anvils, and metalworking tools.|$|E
25|$|Three {{engines and}} four {{transmissions}} {{were available for}} every 1977 Chevrolet Nova, including Concours. Buyers could choose from a 110-horsepower 250-cubic-inch inline six, a 145-horsepower 305 cubic-inch two-barrel V-8, or 170-horsepower 350 cubic-inch four-barrel V-8. Shifting was accomplished by three-speed (column or floor shift) and four-speed manuals or Turbo Hydra-Matic. Novas might also be equipped with <b>a</b> <b>heavy-duty</b> suspension or the F41 sport suspension. A surprising number of police departments ordered Novas with either a 305- or 350-cubic-inch V-8 engine, {{following the lead of}} the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department, which had given the compacts an exhaustive evaluation.|$|E
25|$|Some rinks use harness {{systems to}} help skaters learn new jumps in a {{controlled}} manner. The ice rink installs <b>a</b> <b>heavy-duty</b> cable that is securely attached to two walls of the rink. A set of pulleys ride on the cable. The skater wears a vest or belt that has a cable or rope attached to it. That cable/rope is threaded through the movable pulley on the cable above. The coach holds {{the other end of}} the cable and lifts the skater by pulling the cable/rope. The skater can then practice the jump with the coach assisting the completion.|$|E

25|$|The Fairlane/Torino {{continued}} to be constructed with unit-construction like the 1967 models. The new car {{continued to}} use the same suspension as 1967 models, which was coil springs pivot mounted on an upper control arm and a strut stabilized lower control arms in front, with long semi-elliptical leaf springs on a solid axle in rear. <b>A</b> <b>heavy-duty</b> suspension option was available for V8 powered cars, and included extra-heavy-duty springs and shocks. Steering was recirculating ball system, with power steering optional. All cars came standard with four-wheel drum brakes, although front disc brakes and power assist were options.|$|E
25|$|Diodes {{will prevent}} {{currents}} in unintended directions. To supply power to an electrical circuit during a power failure, the circuit can draw current from a battery. An {{uninterruptible power supply}} may use diodes in this {{way to ensure that}} current is only drawn from the battery when necessary. Likewise, small boats typically have two circuits each with their own battery/batteries: one used for engine starting; one used for domestics. Normally, both are charged from a single alternator, and <b>a</b> <b>heavy-duty</b> split-charge diode is used to prevent the higher-charge battery (typically the engine battery) from discharging through the lower-charge battery when the alternator is not running.|$|E
25|$|The fire left 134 men {{dead and}} 161 more injured. Many {{aircraft}} {{and a large}} amount of ordnance were jettisoned to prevent them from catching fire or exploding. Twenty-one aircraft also sustained enough damage from fire, explosions and salt water, to be stricken from naval inventory, including seven F-4B Phantom IIs (BuNos 153046, 153054, 153060, 153061, 153066, 153069 and 153912); eleven A-4E Skyhawks (149996, 150064, 150068, 150084, 150115, 150118, 150129, 152018, 152024, 152036 and 152040); and three RA-5C Vigilantes (148932, 149284 and 149305). The fire also revealed that Forrestal required <b>a</b> <b>heavy-duty,</b> armored forklift for use in the emergency jettisoning of aircraft (particularly heavier types such as the RA-5C Vigilante) as well as heavy or damaged ordnance. Sailors had been forced to manually jettison numerous 250- and 500-lb. bombs by rolling them along the deck and off the side.|$|E
30|$|As the {{temperature}} varies {{over time and}} the moving parts are heavy, the thermal and mechanical errors exist a strong coupling effect, making the thermal deformation mechanism more complicated and the optimization of the structural design more difficult. <b>As</b> <b>heavy-duty</b> CNC machine tools {{are more susceptible to}} environmental temperature shifts (due to the large volume, small changes of environmental temperature can cause noteworthy accumulations of thermal expansion of the machine tool structure in 3 -D space), the robustness of the thermal error prediction model of heavy-duty CNC machine tools is more difficult to control.|$|R
50|$|The MAZ-530 is <b>a</b> Soviet-era <b>heavy-duty</b> {{dump truck}} with 6×4 wheels, {{produced}} at the Minsk Automobile Plant and Belarusian Automobile Works from 1957 to 1960 and from 1960 to 1963, respectively.|$|R

25|$|The {{weapon was}} {{modified}} with a two-stage trigger mechanism with an adjustable pull force, a wooden buttstock that folds {{to the right}} side of the weapon and <b>a</b> <b>heavy-duty</b> bipod, mounted to the forward base of the receiver housing that folds beneath the handguard when not in use. The buttstock is fully adjustable in length and height and features a variable-height cheek riser. The rifle comes with mechanical iron sights and an adapter used to mount a telescopic day sight (Nimrod 6×40) or a night sight. The mount is quick-detachable and capable of retaining zero after remounting. The precision rifle is stored in a rugged transport case that comes with an optical sight, mount, filters, two slings (for carrying and firing) and a cleaning kit. Recent production models feature synthetic plastic furniture and a skeletonized metal stock.|$|E
500|$|Elsewhere in the complex, smaller {{steam engines}} are on display, {{alongside}} Victorian tools and domestic {{equipment such as}} stoves. [...] Much of the equipment in the workshop is also original, such as the main forge and <b>a</b> <b>heavy-duty</b> metal lathe. [...] The single-cylinder Easton and Amos steam engine used to power the belts which drive the machine tools in the workshop was already several years old when the Goldstone Pumping Station acquired it in 1875.|$|E
500|$|Gerry Anderson drew {{inspiration}} for the series' underlying concept from the West German mining disaster known as the Wunder von Lengede ("Miracle of Lengede"). In October 1963, {{the collapse of a}} nearby dam flooded an iron mine in the municipality of Lengede, killing 29 miners and trapping 21 others underground. Lacking the means to drill an escape shaft, the authorities were forced to requisition <b>a</b> <b>heavy-duty</b> bore from Bremen; despite the considerable time necessary to transport the bore by rail significantly reducing the chances of a successful rescue, 11 of the trapped miners were eventually saved. Recognising the advantages of swifter crisis response, Anderson conceived the idea of an [...] "international rescue" [...] organisation that could use supersonic aircraft to transport specialised rescue equipment quickly over long distances.|$|E

500|$|The H-5 series {{followed}} in February 1941, with heavier defensive armament. Like the H-4, it retained a PVC 1006 L bomb rack to {{enable it to}} carry heavy bombs under the fuselage. The first ten He 111H-5s were pathfinders, and selected for special missions. The aircraft sometimes carried 25kg flashlight bombs which acted as flares. The H-5 could also carry heavy fire bombs, either heavy containers or smaller incendiary devices attached to parachutes. The H-5 also carried LM A and LM B aerial mines for anti-shipping operations. After the 80th production aircraft, the PVC 1006 L bomb rack was removed and replaced with <b>a</b> <b>heavy-duty</b> ETC 2000 rack, enabling the H-5 to carry the SC 2500 [...] "Max" [...] bomb, on the external ETC 2000 rack, which enabled it to support the [...] bomb.|$|E
2500|$|The {{heavy duty}} [...] narrow-gauge {{railways}} in Australia (e.g. Queensland), South Africa, and New Zealand show {{that if the}} track is built to <b>a</b> <b>heavy-duty</b> standard, performance {{almost as good as}} a standard gauge line is possible. Some 200-car trains operate on the Sishen-Saldanha railway in South Africa, and high-speed Tilt Trains run in Queensland. [...] Another example of <b>a</b> <b>heavy-duty</b> narrow-gauge line is EFVM in Brazil. [...] gauge, it has over-100-pound rail (...) and a loading gauge almost as large as US nonexcess-height lines. It has multiple [...] locomotives and 200+ car trains. In South Africa and New Zealand, the loading gauge is similar to the restricted British loading gauge, and in New Zealand some British Rail Mark 2 carriages have been rebuilt with new bogies for use by Tranz Scenic (Wellington-Palmerston North service), Tranz Metro (Wellington-Masterton service), and Transdev Auckland (Auckland suburban services).|$|E
2500|$|Romans used a {{wide variety}} of {{practical}} and decorative footwear, all of it flat soled (without heels). Outdoor shoes were often hobnailed for grip and durability.
