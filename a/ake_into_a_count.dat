40|$|Abstract: In pattern recognition, it is {{well known}} that the {{classifier}} performance depends on the classification rule and the complexities presented in the data sets (such as class overlapping, class imbalance, outliers, high-dimensional data sets among others). In this way, the issue of class imbalance is exhibited when one class is less represented with respect to the other classes. If the classifier is trained with imbalanced data sets, the natural tendency is to recognize the samples included in the majority class, ignoring the minority classes. This situation is not desirable because in real problems it is necessary to recognize the minority class more without sacrificing the precision of the majority class. In this work we analyze the behaviour of four classifiers taking <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>count</b> <b>a</b> relative balance among the accuracy classes...|$|R
40|$|In {{extended}} Key Compromise Impersonation (eKCI) {{attack against}} authenticated key establishment (AKE) protocols the adversary impersonates one party, having {{the long term}} key and the ephemeral key of the other peer party. Such an attack can be mounted against variety of AKE protocols, including 3 -pass HMQV. An intuitive countermeasure, based on BLS (Boneh–Lynn–Shacham) signatures, for strengthening HMQV was proposed in literature. The original HMQV protocol fulfills the deniability property: a party can deny its participation in the protocol execution, as the peer party can create a fake protocol transcript indistinguishable from the real one. Unfortunately, the modified BLS based version of HMQV is not deniable. In this {{paper we propose a}} method for converting HMQV (and similar <b>AKE</b> protocols) <b>into</b> <b>a</b> protocol resistant to eKCI attacks but without losing the original deniability property. For that purpose, instead of the undeniable BLS, we use a modification of Schnorr authentication protocol, which is deniable and immune to ephemeral key leakages...|$|R

It was shown that 2 fFCS gives excellent results for measuring the diffusion of small molecules. However, when measuring colloids or macromolecules, the size of these objects can no longer be neglected with respect to the excitation laser focus.

40|$|Many {{research}} in coding theory is focussed on linear error-correcting codes. Since these codes are subspaces, linear algebra plays {{a prominent role}} in studying them. An important polynomial invariant of linear error-correcting codes is the (extended) weight enumerator. The weight enumerator gives information about the probability of undetected errors in error-detection, and about the probability of decoding errors in bounded distance decoding. Furthermore, the extended weight enumerator is equivalent to the Tutte polynomial of the matroid associated to the code. Linear codes are closely connected to hyperplane arrangements: the columns of the generator matrix of a code can be viewed as the coordinates of a hyperplane arrangement over a finite field. Using this correspondence, the problem of determining the extended weight enumerator can be transformed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>counting</b> problem on <b>a</b> hyperplane arrangement. In fact, the extended weight enumerator is equivalent to the coboundary polynomial (or two-variable characteristic polynomial) of the associated hyperplane arrangement.

40|$|<b>A</b> {{cellular}} <b>counting</b> {{system based}} on synthetic gene circuits would enable complex biological programming and be used in many biotechnology applications. Although a variety of synthetic memory circuits have been constructed, basic modules that can be assembled <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>counting</b> system are lacking. This thesis focuses on engineering <b>a</b> binary <b>counting</b> module, which can alternate between two states {{in response to a}} single repeating input signal. The highly directional large serine bacteriophage integrases were utilised {{as the basis for the}} synthetic circuits constructed in this study. Integrases and their protein co-factors, the recombination directionality factor (RDF) can change the orientation of a specific DNA segment flanked by two recombination sites. Integrase alone switches the orientation in one direction, and this directionality is reversed by the addition of its corresponding RDF. The two orientations can be used to turn gene expression on and off, leading to distinct output states which can be thought of as representing a single binary digit (0 and 1) heritably stored in the DNA. In this study, three different serine integrase-based synthetic gene circuits for cellular memory and counting were engineered and characterised. A set-reset latch was first constructed. By expressing ϕC 31 integrase and co-expressing integrase with RDF Gp 3 from two independent inducible systems, the orientation of the invertible DNA in the set-reset latch was inverted and restored respectively. This device demonstrated that ϕC 31 integrase can successfully encode information into plasmid DNA. Next, a state-based latch was constructed, in which the gp 3 gene was placed inside the invertible DNA segment to couple its transcriptional regulation to the circuit state. Integrase expression triggered by one input signal resulted in inversion of the invertible DNA, placing the gp 3 gene in the correct orientation for transcription. Gp 3 expression can then be triggered by another input signal to reverse the directionality of integrase, restoring the DNA back to its original configuration. By optimising the stoichiometry and kinetics of integrase and Gp 3 expression, efficient switching of both multi-copy plasmid and single copy chromosomal DNA was achieved. Finally, the state-based latch was developed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> binary <b>counting</b> module by introducing a delay mechanism, in which gp 3 transcription was inhibited by a state-based repressor during recombination requiring the absence of Gp 3. Placing expression of gp 3 under the control of the invertible DNA, allowed a single input signal controlling only integrase expression to switch the module between OFF (0) and ON (1). This is the first integrase-based module that generates different outputs in response to the same input signal and a fundamental step towards building a genetic binary counter with large counting capacity...|$|R
