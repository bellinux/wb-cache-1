The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-9 was {{selected}} as the primary fighter with the Yakovlev Yak-15 relegated to conversion training and familiarization. The imminent availability of British jet engines and access to German jet technology and engineers meant that there was no longer <b>any</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> mixed-power aircraft, but Stalin insisted that the I-250 finish its trials and that the tooling and drawings should be retained along with unassembled parts even though the program was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Incumbent Republican Senator Scott Brown ran for {{re-election}} to a first full term.

Warren clinched near-unanimous party support, with {{all but one of the}} other Democratic candidates withdrawing following her entrance. After winning her party's nomination, eliminating <b>any</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a primary, she faced Brown in the general election.|$|E

5|$|Jane Pierce died of {{tuberculosis}} in Andover, Massachusetts in December 1863; she was buried at Old North Cemetery in Concord, New Hampshire. Pierce was further grieved by his close friend Nathaniel Hawthorne's death in May 1864; {{he was with}} Hawthorne when the author died unexpectedly. Hawthorne had controversially dedicated his final book to Pierce. Some Democrats tried again to put Pierce's name up for consideration as the 1864 presidential election unfolded, but he kept his distance; Lincoln easily won a second term. When news spread of Lincoln's assassination in April 1865, a mob gathered outside Pierce's home in Concord, demanding to know why he had not raised a flag as a public mourning gesture. Pierce grew angry, expressing sadness over Lincoln's death but denying <b>any</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a public gesture. He told them that his history of military and public service proved his patriotism, which was enough to quiet the crowd.|$|E

25|$|The unary {{notation}} can be abbreviated {{by introducing}} different symbols for certain new values. Very commonly, {{these values are}} powers of 10; so for instance, if / stands for one, − for ten and + for 100, then the number 304 can be compactly represented as +++ //// and the number 123 as + − − /// without <b>any</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> zero. This is called sign-value notation. The ancient Egyptian numeral system was of this type, and the Roman numeral system was a modification of this idea.|$|E

25|$|The diet of the {{inhabitants}} of El Paraíso consisted of a mix of domesticated and gathered resources. El Paraíso had a rather simple subsistence economy. There is a high amount of non-domesticated foods found in the archaeological record, which supports that there were sufficient resources that could be hunted or collected. Wild plants such as the roots of sedges, groundcherry and cat tails may have accounted for {{a substantial portion of}} the diet. More than 90% of their protein came from marine resources, predominantly bony fishes and molluscs. Based on minimum number of individuals (MNI) results, the bony fishes mainly consisted of anchovies and the most common molluscs were mussels. There is almost a complete absence of terrestrial fauna found at El Paraíso. The predominance of marine resources may have prevented <b>any</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a complex agricultural subsistence economy. Cotton was cultivated to provide nets for fishing as well as clothing for {{the inhabitants}} of El Paraíso showing a prominence in industrial agriculture in subsistence strategies.|$|E
25|$|Lee {{was unsure}} of Grant's plan.

The Union Army could either be heading east to Fredericksburg or moving south. In either event, the crossroads at Spotsylvania Court House would play an important role, so Lee ordered his artillery chief, Brig. Gen. William N. Pendleton, to begin constructing a road through the woods from the Confederate position at the Wilderness due south to the Catharpin Road. He also ordered Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson, who had replaced Lt. Gen. James Longstreet in command of the First Corps following that officer's wounding on May 6, to move out along that road. Lee did not indicate <b>any</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> haste, but Anderson and his men desired to leave the stench of burning forest and dead bodies in the Wilderness, so they began marching about 10 p.m.|$|E
25|$|Upon a {{demise of}} the Crown (the death or abdication of a sovereign), it is {{customary}} for the accession of the new monarch to be publicly proclaimed by the Governor-General {{on behalf of the}} Federal Executive Council, which meets at Government House, Canberra, after the accession. Parallel proclamations are made by the governors in each state. Regardless of any proclamations, the late sovereign's heir immediately and automatically succeeds, without <b>any</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> confirmation or further ceremony. Following an appropriate period of mourning, the monarch is also crowned in the United Kingdom, though this ritual is not necessary for a sovereign to reign; for example, Edward VIII was never crowned, yet was undoubtedly king during his short time on the throne. After an individual ascends the throne, he or she typically continues to reign until death. There is no provision in the law for a monarch to unilaterally abdicate; the only Australian monarch to abdicate, Edward VIII, did so as a consequence of abdicating as monarch of the United Kingdom, with which the Australian government had agreed.|$|E
