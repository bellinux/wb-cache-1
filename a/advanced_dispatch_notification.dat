40|$|The ALIA 4 J {{approach}} {{provides a}} framework for implementing execution environments with support for <b>advanced</b> <b>dispatching</b> as found, e. g., in aspect-oriented or predicate-dispatching languages. It also defines an extensible meta-model acting as intermediate representation for dispatching declarations, e. g., pointcut-advice or predicate methods. From the intermediate representation of all dispatch declarations in the program the framework derives an execution model for which ALIA 4 J specifies a generic execution strategy. The meta-object protocol (MOP) formed by the meta-model and framework is defined such that new programming language concepts can be implemented modularly: The semantics can be implemented in an interpretative style (e. g., using reflection) or by describing how to generate corresponding Java bytecode or even machine code. In the latter two cases, the implementation can reason about the current code generation context; this enables sophisticated optimizations. We discuss these optimization facilities by means of two case studies...|$|R
40|$|As {{a partial}} {{solution}} to the problem of increasing foreign petroleum imports,urban congestion, and air pollution from automobiles, NREL researchers have successfully demonstrated a transportation concept called Transit-On-Demand (TOD). TOD uses the global positioning system (GPS) to locate all vehicles in a fleet, two-way communications between the vehicles and a central computer-server, and <b>advanced</b> <b>dispatching</b> and routing software to control the movement of vehicles within the fleet. Reducing the vehicle-miles-travelled (VMTs) through implementing efficient transportation systems such as TOD, results in less energy being required for transportation and a decrease in the amount of required imported petroleum. Through development of an advanced world wide web site and use of the new Java{trademark} Internet programming language, the demonstration allows visitors to the web site to see updates of vehicle position on a map every 20 seconds,while effectively minimizing the internet bandwidth required.

40|$|New {{programming}} {{languages are}} frequently {{designed to improve}} upon other languages or to simplify programs through domain-specific abstractions. They are often implemented as transformations to an established (intermediate) language (IL). But while many new languages overlap in the semantics of their core concepts, re-using the corresponding transformations is limited by existing compiler implementation frameworks. In the ALIA 4 J approach, we have identified dispatching as fundamental to most abstraction mechanisms and provide a meta-model of dispatching as a rich, extensible IL. Based on this meta-model, the semantics of new atomic language concepts can be implemented in a modular and portable fashion.

40|$|New {{programming}} languages {{that allow}} {{to reduce the}} complexity of software solutions are frequently developed, often as extensions of existing languages. Many implementations thus resort to transforming the extension’s source code to the imperative intermediate representation of the parent language. But approaches like compiler frameworks only allow for re-use of code transformations for syntactically-related languages; they do not allow for re-use across language families. In this paper, we present the ALIA 4 J approach to bring such re-use to language families with <b>advanced</b> <b>dispatching</b> mechanisms like pointcut-advice or predicate dispatching. ALIA 4 J introduces a meta-model of dispatching as a rich, extensible intermediate language. By implementing language constructs from four languages as refinements of this meta-model, we show that {{a significant amount of}} them can be re-used across language families. Another building block of ALIA 4 J is a framework for execution environments that automatically derives an execution model of the program’s dispatching from representations in our intermediate language. This model enables different execution strategies for dispatching; we have validated this by implementing three execution environments whose strategies range from interpretation to optimizing code generation...|$|R

Nevertheless, actual implementations of these systems in practice are scarce. Essential for implementation of an <b>advanced</b> <b>dispatching</b> system is the trust of traffic controllers into a stable working of the system. Nervous systems might change advice suddenly, and even switch back to a solution previously discarded, as time and knowledge of the perturbation progress. To this end, we propose several metrics and a framework to assess the stability of railway dispatching solutions under incomplete knowledge, and report on the evaluation of the state-of-the-art dispatching system ROMA, coupled with the simulation environment EGTRAIN, here considered as a surrogate of the real field. Rescheduling plans calculated at different control stages have been compared for different prediction horizons of the rescheduling tool. This setup has been applied to the Dutch Utrecht-Den Bosch corridor. Results obtained from this case study show that more stable control strategies are achieved when using shorter prediction horizons.

40|$|Programming-language {{research}} {{produces a}} significant number of new programming styles to improve the composability of programs. This increases re-usability as well as other quality characteristics. But although they offer interesting composition concepts, new programming languages are rarely used because IDE support, which developers are used to, is missing. Examples of such IDE support are the visualization of call hierarchies or interactive debugging. While some languages, e. g., AspectJ, eventually reach a more mature level with elaborate IDE integration, not all language designers are able to invest this much effort towards IDE integration. Furthermore, the IDE integration of AspectJ also has its limitations; when debugging, the developer is confronted with synthetic code with no exact correspondence in the source code. As a result, the developer needs to understand the transformations performed by the compiler. Finally, some information invariably gets lost during weaving, e. g., the ability to map code evaluating pointcut designators to their definition in the source code. In this paper, we propose to implement generic IDE tools for programming languages that provide <b>advanced</b> <b>dispatching</b> mechanisms. Such languages, including predicate dispatching and pointcut-advice languages, can be mapped to our execution model, called ALIA. The same execution model can then drive debugging functionality as well as static IDE services. 1...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} the potential reduction in door-to-balloon time (DTB) by allowing paramedics to perform prehospital ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) notification using brief communications via emergency medical services (EMS) 9 - 1 - 1 dispatchers {{as soon as they}} saw a STEMI on 12 -lead electrocardiogram (EKG). Our hypothesis was that earlier cardiac catheterization lab (CCL) activation would improve overall DTB and avoid delays arising from on-scene issues or the time required to deliver a full report. Methods: The study setting was a single suburban community teaching hospital, which is a regional percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) center with more than 120, 000 Emergency Department (ED) visits/year and is serviced by a single tiered-response, advanced life support (ALS) paramedic-level agency. STEMI notifications from July 2009 to July 2012 occurred by either standard direct EMS-to-physician notification or by immediate 9 - 1 - 1 <b>dispatch</b> <b>notification.</b> In the 9 - 1 - 1 dispatcher-aided notification method, paramedics were asked to provide a brief one-sentence report using their lapel microphones upon immediate realization of a diagnostic EKG (usually within 1 - 2 minutes of patient contact). This report to the 9 - 1 - 1 dispatcher included the patient’s sex, age, and cardiologist (if known). The dispatcher then called the emergency department attending and informed them that a STEMI was being transported and that CCL activation was needed. We used retrospective chart review of a consecutive sample of patients from an existing STEMI registry to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference in DTB between the groups. Results: Eight hundred fifty-six total STEMI alert patients arrived by EMS during the study. We excluded 730 notifications due to events such as cardiac arrest, arrhythmia, death, resolution of EKG changes and/or symptoms, cardiologist decision not to perform PCI, arrival as a transfer after prior stabilization at a referring facility or arriving by an EMS agency other than New Castle County EMS (NCC*EMS). Sixty-four (64) sequential patients from each group comprised the study sample. The average DTB (SD) for the standard communication method was 57. 6 minutes (17. 9), while that for dispatcher-aided communication was 46. 1 minutes (12. 8), (mean difference 57. 6 - 46. 1 minutes= 11. 5 minutes with a 95...|$|R

40|$|Developing {{extensions}} to general-purpose langauges or domain-specific languages {{with support}} for {{new kinds of}} abstractions is an ongoing trend. Modern language workbenches, such as EMFText of Xtext, support this trend and facilitate implementing langauges in terms of transformations from the new language into an established (intermediate) language. Often, however, the implementation of one element in the source language becomes scattered and tangled in the target language, which makes transformations complex. Furthermore, even though many languages share core concepts, current approaches do not support sharing transformations that implement their semantics; the only possibility of re-using transformations from a language is to extend it syntactically. We have identified dispatching as fundamental to most abstraction mechanisms. With the ALIA 4 J approach, we provide a meta-model of dispatching to act as rich and extensible intermediate language that allows more direct transformation.

40|$|To {{increase}} program modularity, new languages {{have been}} researched in recent years. They allow changing behavior according to {{various kinds of}} contexts at the call sites. In our research, we classified them as advanced-dispatching languages. Advanced-dispatching languages are usually implemented {{as an extension of}} main-stream languages. After compilation, their programs are transformed to the compiled form of the main-stream language. Due to this compilation mechanism, source-level abstractions cannot be fully restored during debugging. The information loss increases the effort of comprehending advanced-dispatching programs and fixing advanced-dispatching-specific defects. In this thesis, we performed four works to improve the comprehensibility of debugging advanced-dispatching programs on three debugging techniques [...] - interactive debugging, trace-based debugging, and slicing. Interactive debugging is the most common debugging technique. We proposed eleven atomic advanced-dispatching-specific debugging tasks based on four aspect-oriented-specific fault models. To support the tasks, we modified an existing compiler to keep aspect-oriented information after the compilation, extended java virtual machine, built a dedicated <b>advanced</b> <b>dispatching</b> debugging model, and implemented graphical user interfaces. In interactive debugging, breakpoints set for solving one problem are logically related. However, existing debuggers do not support to build logic between breakpoints. Therefore, programmers have to manually perform some unnecessarily repeated tasks. We analysed five common debugging scenarios and proposed a breakpoint language that uses pointcuts to select suspension times. Interactive debugging cannot support backward inspection, which is required in tracking from an observed behavior to the defect. Trace-based debugging solves this problem by recording events at runtime and then supporting inspection offline. Existing researches on trace-based debugging for advanced-dispatching languages are limited. We proposed a dedicated trace-based debugger with an user interface that allow programmers to navigate and query the recorded trace. Besides debugging techniques performed on runtime inforamtion, we also looked into slicing, which is a static technique that automatically select relevant program statements. It can complement problems of guessing locations for setting breakpoints in interactive debugging and searching relevant information in trace-based debugging. We developed dependency graphs that are dedicated to aspect-oriented programs, as well as a slicing algorithm that is performed on the developed dependency graphs...|$|R

30|$|Although NoSQL {{systems are}} {{designed}} to be elastic, they are however not autonomously elastic, which means external components are specifically required for making decisions (such as when to increase or decrease the resources) and thereby taking appropriate actions (e.g., scaling up/down or scaling out/in). The component responsible to provide such a service is the Adaptation Controller component. The Adaptation Controller component is responsible for the management of resources and triggers an appropriate action (e.g., install new instances to a database cluster, change the replication factor, etc) if the resources are suffering from various ongoing issues or if the unusual demand situations have occurred. The component reads the up-to-date monitored QoS metrics (Step B in Fig.  3) from the Storage Monitor sub component of the Monitoring Component, which provides continuous monitoring capabilities. The Adaptation Controller component contains a number of (re)configuration rules and based on these rules and the monitored QoS metrics, and finally make effective decisions. For example, Listing 3 shows the (re)configuration rule to keep the average latency of the Cassandra storage system below 30 ms. The appropriate (re)configuration action (i.e., adding a new storage node), specified in the (re)configuration action executes in case of service violation. To perform such an action, as part of Step D in Fig.  3, the component <b>dispatches</b> a <b>notification</b> change signal to the Deployment Agent component, which is responsible for providing the needed deployment support. Another example of service violation is to give an indication that the system (e.g., Cassandra, MongoDB, etc) is running out of storage or memory. In such a case, the Deployment Agent component acts to increase the system memory or storage.|$|R
