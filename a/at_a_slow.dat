To speed up the encirclement of the strong point at Lipka, the Soviet side used the 12th Ski Brigade which crossed the ice of the Ladoga Lake and attacked the German rear lines. By {{the end of the}} day the German forces in the Lipka and Shlisselburg areas were almost completely cut off from the rest of the German forces.|$|E
5|$|The Lady Chapel {{was built}} by William de Braose, bishop from 1266 to 1287.

From this time on, it seemed as if the cathedral was in a constant state of repair or alterations <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> pace.

5|$|After {{reaching}} this strength, {{the storm}} slowed and gradually {{took a more}} northwesterly course, heading towards Pinar del Río Province in western Cuba. On September16, the system attained winds of 75mph (120km/h), what would now be considered a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Moving <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> pace of , the system gradually intensified. Late on September18, {{the center of the}} storm was estimated to have made landfall in Pinar del Río Province with winds of 100mph (155km/h); an atmospheric pressure of 976mbar (hPa; 28.82inHg) was recorded during its passage. The storm's eye passed over the town of Manta for four hours, between 3:00pm and 7:00pm on September17.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Debra was a {{destructive}} tropical cyclone that {{developed during the}} 1959 Atlantic hurricane season. The fifth tropical storm and third hurricane of the season, Debra originated from the interaction of a cold-core low and a tropical wave on July15. The system was designated a tropical depression on July23 when it was south of Louisiana and meandered westward while it swiftly intensified into a tropical storm along the Gulf Coast of the United States. A turn towards the northwest became evident as it attained Category1 hurricane status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale the following day while it organized into a developed storm. As the hurricane curved northward <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> forward speed, strength was maintained as it approached the coast of Texas as a minimal hurricane. It came ashore during the evening of July24 local time (0000UTC on July25) between Freeport and Galveston, Texas. It rapidly weakened into a tropical storm and later a depression as it moved inland, and dissipated on July28 while it turned northwestward. The remnant moisture later sparked upper-level thunderstorms in late July and early August.|$|E
5|$|Narayan's {{performances}} are strung together from the meditative and measured alap (non-metrical introduction) and jor (performance with pulse) in dhrupad style, {{followed by a}} faster and less reserved gat section (composition with rhythmic pattern provided by the tabla) in khyal style. He experimented with a style of jhala (performance with rapid pulse) developed by Bundu Khan, but considered it more appropriate for plucked instruments and stopped performing it. The gat section includes one or two parts with compositions. When two gats are used, the first one tends to be <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> or medium tempo, and the second one is faster; the gats are usually performed in the 16-beat rhythmic cycle tintal. Narayan often completes performances with ragas associated with thumri (a popular light classical genre), which {{are referred to as}} mishra (Sanskrit: mixed) because they allow for additional notes, or with a dhun (song based on folk music).|$|E

Flaps {{are often used}} to steepen the landing approach angle and let the plane land <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> touchdown speed (as well as letting the aircraft lift off <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>slower</b> takeoff speed). In both cases, flaps enable using a shorter runway than would otherwise be required.|$|R
5|$|The area of low {{pressure}} gained sufficient shower activity and organization to be renamed as a tropical cyclone at 1800UTC on 10 March while located {{southwest of the}} Solomon Islands capital of Honiara. Erica gradually intensified, attaining the equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale (SSHS) Originally moving to the southeast <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> pace, Erica began to accelerate due to the influence of weak mid–level ridge to its east. Continuing to intensify, the cyclone reached its peak intensity on 13 March with a minimum barometric pressure of , and peak winds of 260km/h (150mph 1-minute sustained). The eye of the cyclone began to shrink in diameter and become symmetrical. Later on 13 March, Erica began to parallel the western coast of New Caledonia while maintaining a strong intensity, before crossing the extreme southern end of the island at the Caledonian island commune of L'Île-des-Pins.|$|E
5|$|The first geared {{clock was}} invented in the 11th century by the Arab {{engineer}} Ibn Khalaf al-Muradi in Islamic Iberia; it was a water clock that employed a complex gear train mechanism, including both segmental and epicyclic gearing, capable of transmitting high torque. The clock was unrivalled in its use of sophisticated complex gearing, until the mechanical clocks of the mid-14th century. Al-Muradi's clock also employed the use of mercury in its hydraulic linkages, which could function mechanical automata. Al-Muradi's work was known to scholars working under Alfonso X of Castile, hence the mechanism {{may have played a}} role in the development of the European mechanical clocks. Other monumental water clocks constructed by medieval Muslim engineers also employed complex gear trains and arrays of automata. Like the earlier Greeks and Chinese, Arab engineers at the time also developed a liquid-driven escapement mechanism which they employed in some of their water clocks. Heavy floats were used as weights and a constant-head system was used as an escapement mechanism, which was present in the hydraulic controls they used to make heavy floats descend <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> and steady rate.|$|E
5|$|The reforms became firmly {{rooted in}} Bosnia during the 1860s, when the Ottoman {{governor}} (vali) {{of the province}} was Topal Sherif Osman Pasha, {{though most of the}} changes proceeded <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> pace. According to the recently issued Ottoman constitutional law, each vilayet (first-order administrative division) was to have an official printing house and an official gazette. The Constitutional Law for the Vilayet of Bosnia, published in 1865, promoted the province from the rank of eyalet to that of vilayet, and Article9 of this law stipulated that there be an official printing house in its capital. Osman Pasha also had other motivations to establish a printing house. At that time, the press in the Principality of Serbia and in South Slavic parts of the Austrian Empire sharply criticised the Ottoman regime in Bosnia. Textbooks imported from Serbia for Serb elementary schools in Bosnia also disseminated nationalist sentiment, which Osman Pasha saw as anti-Ottoman. In his view, the national movement of the Serbs in Bosnia presented a danger for Ottoman state interests. To protect their hold on Bosnia, the Ottomans sought to promote the idea of a unitary Bosnian nation, thus counteracting the particular national identities and political aspirations of Bosnia's Serbs, Croats, and Muslims.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to earlier}} {{recurring}} issues with mistranslations related to news updates, the team {{decided not to}} implement forums in the original release, instead hearing player feedback through fan sites and unofficial forums. Also because of mistranslation fears, dedicated teams {{in each of the}} game's release regions would gather feedback and transmit it to the development team. The game's first closed Alpha test began on March 11, 2010. It was available only to veteran players from XI. During alpha testing, the team used player feedback to find out key problems with the game, such as limitations on graphical adjustments making the game run <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>slow</b> frame rate. The open Beta test was originally scheduled to begin on August 31, but was indefinitely postponed due to the discovery of critical bugs in the game. The Beta test eventually went live on September 2, running until the game's release later that month. It was later stated that more time should have been given to fixing bugs during the Beta period. The game released on September 30, 2010, six months prior to the PS3 version's projected release date of March 2011. A Collector's Edition was released on September 22, allowing owners to log into the game from that date. The Collector's Edition, which was decorated by artwork from Amano and Yoshida, came with bonus items including a DVD featuring a behind-the-scenes documentary, a security token, a case for the game's box, and a decorated tumbler. The game was released with text in Japanese, English, French and German, while the spoken dialogue in cutscenes was English in all versions.|$|E
