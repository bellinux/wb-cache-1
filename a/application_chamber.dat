50|$|A {{prototype}} spray-on condom (Sprühkondom) {{was invented}} by Jan Vinzenz Krause of the Institute for Condom Consultancy in 2006. The idea {{was inspired by the}} mechanics of a drive-through car wash—the penis was inserted into a chamber where nozzles apply a coat of fast-drying liquid latex. The process took close to a minute, a restriction that has kept the product off the market. The product was expected to cost around twice as much as a traditional condom. Prototypes consisted of an <b>application</b> <b>chamber</b> and a cartridge of liquid that produces around 20 condoms, depending on penis size.|$|E
40|$|Coating {{devices for}} {{application}} of coating {{material to the}} surface of a web or a flexible substrate utilizing the study of flow patterns in blade coating to develop high-speed coaters, wherein the coater may be modified to provide an air layer between the coating liquid and any lower boundary. The coater devices of the described embodiments provide two inlet channels and an outlet channel. The first inlet channel carries the coating liquid, and the second channel can be used to pump the carrier fluid, e. g. air, into the coating head to pressurize the chamber and to keep the contact wetting line at the upstream section attached to the substrate. The air layer serves as a carrier fluid removing the wall shear stress on the coating liquid in the channel, and thus the coating flow for the operation of the device may proceed without flow separation from the wall (i. e., in a vortex-free mode) at relatively low flow rates appropriate for commercial applications. The excess coating liquid and all of the air leave the coater head at the outlet channel. A coating composition <b>application</b> <b>chamber</b> receives the liquid flow of the liquid coating composition from the upstream direction to the downstream direction. The coating composition <b>application</b> <b>chamber</b> is adapted for receiving a liquid flow of a carrier fluid introduced at the upstream side of the <b>application</b> <b>chamber</b> {{in the direction of the}} travel of the web positioning the liquid flow of the liquid coating composition between the carrier fluid and the web.

40|$|A coating {{applicator}} for application of coating {{material to the}} surface of a web or a flexible substrate. The coating device contains a walled <b>application</b> <b>chamber</b> where a flowing stream of the coating liquid first comes into contact with the substrate. The coating liquid enters a channel of the <b>application</b> <b>chamber</b> at the upstream side and wets the substrate as it flows {{in the same direction as}} the substrate. A doctor element is positioned at the downstream side of the channel where the excess coating in the channel follows the contour of the boundary formed by the doctor element and leaves the channel. One of the applicator walls is designed to be a floating or moving wall or belt. The floating applicator wall and geometry of the streamlined boundaries of the coating device eliminates the formation of recirculating eddies or vortices. The elimination of vortices eliminates flow instability due to centrifugal forces and removes harmful pressure fluctuations which could result in coat-weight nonuniformities.

5000|$|There are {{two main}} <b>applications</b> for vapor <b>chambers.</b> First, they are used when high powers and heat fluxes are applied to a {{relatively}} small evaporator. [...] Heat input to the evaporator vaporizes liquid, which flows in two dimensions to the condenser surfaces. After the vapor condenses on the condenser surfaces, capillary forces in the wick return the condensate to the evaporator. Note that most vapor chambers are insensitive to gravity, and will still operate when inverted, with the evaporator above the condenser. In this <b>application,</b> the vapor <b>chamber</b> acts as a heat flux transformer, cooling a high heat flux from an electronic chip or laser diode, and transforming it to a lower heat flux that can be removed by natural or forced convection. With special evaporator wicks, vapor chambers can remove 2000 W over 4 cm2, or 700 W over 1 cm2.|$|R

In support {{of the development of}} these engines, hot-fire testing on subscale coaxial injectors has been performed at NASA s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to evaluate performance data relative to injector type, liquid oxygen (LOX) post tip design features, element density and various operating conditions. Shear coaxial injectors with element densities of 1. 1, 1. 6, and 2. 3 elements/in 2 and a swirl coaxial injector with element density of 1. 6 elements/in 2 were evaluated at conditions relevant to the Ares <b>applications.</b> <b>Chamber</b> pressures with oxygen/hydrogen propellants ranged from 815 - 1630 psig with mixture ratios ranging from 4. 7 - 6. 9. Fuel manifold inlet temperatures were varied from 90 to 270 R. Shear coaxial LOX post tip thicknesses ranged from 0. 006 in. to 0. 0175 in. Modular, water cooled, calorimeter chamber assemblies were used to provide heating rate data and evaluate the effects of characteristic length (L*). Performance was evaluated relative to the resulting characteristic velocity (C*) efficiency. Testing with both the 2. 3 and 1. 1 elements/in 2 shear coaxial injectors demonstrated no improvement in performance of the "thin" tip configuration versus the "thick" tip configuration. The loss in chamber pressure and associated performance loss seen in previous testing at low fuel temperatures could not be reliably repeated, indicating that this loss is not the result of a fluidic process in the injector elements. Further, no performance loss could be demonstrated once a faceplate seal specifically designed for operation with low temperature hydrogen was implemented in the 1. 1 elements/sq in shear coaxial injector. Results for the 1. 6 elements/sq in swirl injector at cold fuel temperatures showed performance higher than both the 1. 6 elements/in 2 shear coaxial injector and the 2. 3 elements/in 2 shear coaxial injector...|$|R

40|$|A 22 -N class, iridium/rhenium (Ir/Re) rocket chamber, {{composed}} of a thick (418 miocrometer) wrought iridium (Ir) liner and a rhenium substrate deposited via chemical vapor deposition, was tested {{over an extended period}} on gaseous oxygen/gaseous hydrogen (GO 2 /GH 2) propellants. The test conditions were designed to produce species concentrations similar to those expected in an Earth-storable propellant combustion environment. Temperatures attained in testing were significantly higher than those expected with Earth-storable propellants, both because of the inherently higher combustion temperature of GO 2 /GH 2 propellants and because the exterior surface of the rocket was not treated with a high-emissivity coating that would be applied to flight class rockets.
