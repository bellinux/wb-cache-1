5|$|President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who had {{recently}} returned from a diplomatic visit to the United Nations, visited {{the site of the}} explosion on August 7. She was berated by local residents; some were <b>angry</b> <b>because</b> her surprise visit halted work at the site, and others thought her presence was politically motivated. The president stayed briefly, visited the CEMAR and met Bonfatti. Kirchner's entourage was surrounded by members of La Cámpora, who tried to prevent demonstrations against her and keep journalists and residents at bay.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} stage, the Tour reached Nîmes, near the {{home town of}} Payan, whose fans were <b>angry</b> <b>because</b> of his disqualification. They threw rocks at the riders, and barricaded the road. The cyclists had {{troubles}} passing through Nîmes, and several were injured. The most important event for the general classification was when César Garin's bicycle was broken by attackers; {{he had to find}} a new bicycle, which took him 15 minutes. Further on, nails and broken glass were spread along the road. Many riders punctured, but there were no serious falls. The cyclists passed this part walking. After Nîmes, a leading group of five cyclists was formed: Maurice Garin, Pothier, Aucouturier, Cornet and Beaugendre. Aucouturier and Cornet escaped, and Aucouturier won, beating Cornet in the sprint.|$|E

5|$|The show {{centers on}} Michael Britten (Jason Isaacs), a police detective living in two {{separate}} realities after a car accident. In this episode, Michael deals with a case where a girl is found after on a hotel top {{in which she was}} pushed or jumped from. He sees Kate Porter (Brianna Brown) in both realities, after her sister died. In one life, Kate is a successful investment banker, while in the other she is a cocaine addict. Meanwhile, Rex's (Dylan Minnette) racket is broken by his best friend Cole (Logan Miller), which was an accident. Rex is <b>angry</b> <b>because</b> it belonged to his mother, Hannah (Laura Allen).|$|E
5|$|One month later, {{while the}} British warship HMS Romney was in port, {{one of the}} tidesmen changed his story: he now claimed {{that he had been}} {{forcibly}} held on the Liberty while it had been illegally unloaded. On June 10, customs officials seized the Liberty. Bostonians were already <b>angry</b> <b>because</b> the captain of the Romney had been impressing colonists, and not just deserters from the Royal Navy, an arguably illegal activity. A riot broke out when officials began to tow the Liberty out to the Romney, which was also arguably illegal. The confrontation escalated when sailors and marines coming ashore to seize the Liberty were mistaken for a press gang. After the riot, customs officials relocated to the Romney, and then to Castle William (an island fort in the harbor), claiming that they were unsafe in town. Whigs insisted that the customs officials were exaggerating the danger so that London would send troops to Boston.|$|E

5|$|Verdugo, {{having been}} {{forced by the}} Union of Arras – formed by the Dutch provinces loyal to Spanish King Philip II, who wanted the foreign troops out the Netherlands – to hand over his {{regiment}} to his brother-in-law Charles von Mansfeld, recruited a regiment of 2,000 Walloon arquebusiers {{and made his way}} to Friesland. While mustering his infantry in the village of Kerpen, Verdugo learned that the Dutch rebels were leving a company of German reiters – a type of armoured cavalry armed with pistols – in Cologne under a rittmeister called Adam von Langen. As he lacked cavalry or pikemen and it was reported by Spanish agents that von Langen was <b>angry</b> <b>because</b> he had been paid by the Dutch with false coins, Verdugo managed to convince the rittmeister to escort his arquebusiers to Groningen. Passing through Bredevoort and Coevorden, Verdugo and his regiment reached Groningen. There, Verdugo was met with a mutiny, which he ended by distributing 40,000 escudos amongst the mutineers, disbanding an undisciplined German regiment and giving license to two companies of men-at-arms to join Farnese's army in Hainault. With the loyal troops, meanwhile, he took two Dutch forts, one {{at the mouth of the}} Emden and another near Groningen.|$|E
25|$|On June 10, 1768, customs {{officials}} seized the Liberty, a sloop owned by leading Boston merchant John Hancock, on {{allegations that the}} ship {{had been involved in}} smuggling. Bostonians, already <b>angry</b> <b>because</b> the captain of the Romney had been impressing local sailors, began to riot. Customs officials fled to Castle William for protection. With John Adams serving as his lawyer, Hancock was prosecuted in a highly publicized trial by a vice-admiralty court, but the charges were eventually dropped.|$|E
25|$|The first Frisian bishop Boniface {{set out for}} Frisia in 754 with a small retinue. He baptized a {{great number}} and summoned a general meeting for {{confirmation}} at a place not far from Dokkum, between Franeker and Groningen. Instead of the converts he expected, a group of armed inhabitants appeared. The Frisian warriors were <b>angry</b> <b>because</b> he had destroyed their shrines. They slew the aged archbishop because, according to Boniface's hagiographer, they believed the chests he carried with him contained gold and other riches. They were dismayed when they discovered that the chest only contained the bishop's books.|$|E

25|$|Antonio's brother Francesco had {{sided with}} the Spanish and split the {{conclave}} {{and it was his}} negotiations that resulted in Pamphili's election. The final deal in Pamphili's favour included an agreement, designed by the brothers for their own benefit, that the new Pope would allow the Barberini to keep the titles, land and fortunes they had amassed under Pope Urban VIII's reign. Mazarin became so <b>angry</b> <b>because</b> of Antonio's attitude that he deprived him of the protectorate of the Kingdom of France. However, the conflict was of short duration and both cardinals quickly reconciled with each other.|$|E

Before {{the start of}} term, Professor McGonagall {{secretly}} gives Hermione a Time-Turner, a device which enables her {{to go back in}} time and handle her heavy class schedule, though this is not revealed until the penultimate chapter. Much tension comes into play between Hermione and her two best friends; Harry is furious with her because she told McGonagall that he had received a Firebolt, which was confiscated to be inspected for traces of dark magic. Ron is <b>angry</b> <b>because</b> he feels Crookshanks is responsible for Scabbers' disappearance, while Hermione fiercely maintains that Crookshanks is innocent.|$|E
25|$|Holding 52 American diplomats hostage for 444 days {{played a}} role in helping to pass the constitution, suppressing moderates, and {{otherwise}} radicalising the revolution. In late October 1979, the exiled and dying Shah was admitted into the United States for cancer treatment. In Iran there was an immediate outcry and both Khomeini and leftist groups demanding the Shah's return to Iran for trial and execution. On 4 November 1979 youthful Islamists, calling themselves Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line, invaded the embassy compound and seized its staff. Revolutionaries were <b>angry</b> <b>because</b> of how the Shah had fled abroad while the Embassy-based American CIA and British intelligence organized a coup d'état to overthrow his nationalist opponent who was a legitimately elected official.|$|E
50|$|On November 30, the Prussian War Minister, Erich von Falkenhayn, General Berthold Deimling {{and some}} other {{high-ranking}} officers arrived in Donaueschingen and six days of discussions began. The public became even <b>angrier</b> <b>because</b> of that, since the Kaiser apparently only wanted to hear the viewpoint of the military. Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, who had been passed over and who came more and more under pressure, joined the conference shortly before it ended. The result was disillusionment from {{the view of the}} critical classes of the population; the Kaiser approved of the behavior of the military officers and saw {{no reason to believe that}} they had exceeded their authority. Deimling sent a brigade general to Saverne, who restored civilian authority on December 1.|$|R

Lü Bu ordered Hou Cheng to be executed, but Song Xian (宋憲) and Wei Xu (魏續) pleaded with their lord to spare Hou Cheng. Lü Bu then had Hou Cheng flogged 50 times before releasing him.

25|$|An Iraqi {{survivor}} {{from the}} same boat, Zainab Abbas, who also lost two children from the disaster, told reporters that Abdullah had been presented to her as the 'captain', that he was driving the overcrowded boat too fast, causing it to flip over, and that he pleaded with her {{while they were still}} both in the water not to report him to anyone in authority. Abbas said her family escaped out of Baghdad from ISIS and she was <b>angry</b> <b>because</b> all the media attention was on Aylan Kurdi and Abdullah Kurdi and not on her family. She later returned to Baghdad and said her dead children's bodies had not been correctly prepared for burial and called on Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott to grant her family asylum so they can escape Islamic State. The Reuters agency reported that interviews with two other passengers in the boat, Iraqis Ahmed Hadi Jawwad (Zainab Abbas's husband), and 22-year-old Amir Haider, corroborated Abbas's account.|$|E
25|$|In 1983–1984, however, {{approximately}} 90 employees {{left the}} newspaper after a rift over Becerra Acosta's management style. They were <b>angry</b> <b>because</b> {{they believed that}} Unomásunos management had abused the good faith of its employees, was far away from its editorial roots, that {{the board of directors}} was too conservative, and that it had anti-syndical tendencies. They were also angry that Becerra Acosta reportedly accepted a loan from the government to help Unomásuno through its financial difficulties. In their eyes, Unomásuno was sacrificing its autonomy by accepting the government's help. The defectors of Unomásuno, headed by journalists Payán, Lira Saade, Miguel Ángel Granados Chapa, Héctor Aguilar Camín, and Ricardo Alemán, formed a competing daily newspaper known as La Jornada on September 19, 1984. La Jornada established its reputation among Mexican readers as a leading opposition newspaper for its anti-political establishment publications, while Unomásunos readership declined and became more irrelevant nationwide throughout the start of the 1990s. Unomásunos editorial tone moved to the political right after separating from La Jornada and lost its independent orientation because of its ties with the government.|$|E
25|$|Although he {{made many}} {{attempts}} at conforming to traditional Jewish laws, {{there were more}} instances where Herod was insensitive, which constitutes {{one of the major}} Jewish complaints towards Herod as highlighted in Jewish Antiquities. In Jerusalem, Herod introduced foreign forms of entertainment, and erected a golden eagle at the entrance of the Temple, which suggested a greater interest in the welfare of Rome than of Jews. Herod's taxes garnered a bad reputation - his constant concern for his reputation led him to make frequent, expensive gifts, increasingly emptying the kingdom's coffers, and such lavish spending upset his Jewish subjects. The two major Jewish sects during his reign, the Pharisees and the Sadducees, both showed opposition to Herod. The Pharisees were <b>angry</b> <b>because</b> Herod disregarded many of their demands for the Temple's construction. At the same time the Sadducees, who were known for their priestly responsibilities in the Temple, opposed Herod because he replaced their high priests with outsiders from Babylonia and Alexandria, in an effort to gain support from the Jewish Diaspora. These efforts proved ineffective, {{and at the end of}} Herod's reign, anger and dissatisfaction were common amongst Jews. Heavy outbreaks of violence and riots followed Herod's death in many cities, including Jerusalem, as all the built-up grievances against him were unleashed. The momentum from these revolts led to an increased demand for Jewish freedom from Roman rule. Herod's leadership caused enough anger for it to become a prime cause of the Great Revolt of 70 C.E.|$|E
