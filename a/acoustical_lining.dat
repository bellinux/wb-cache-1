40|$|Experiments with a {{modified}} J 65 turbojet engine and ejector resulted in noise power reductions {{as large as}} 13 decibels in the low-frequency range. High-frequency noise power, which appeared to originate mainly from the mixing processes within the ejector, increased. Peak velocities at the ejector exit were reduced by one-half to two-thirds, although survey rakes showed that mixing was not complete. <b>Acoustical</b> <b>lining</b> inside the ejector would reduce the perceived noise level (in PNdB) by removing much of the high-frequency noise...|$|E
40|$|A {{by-product}} of Heating, Ventilation, and Air-conditioning (HVAC) systems is noise that {{is produced by}} fans, compressors, and other related equipments and the noises from the turbulence that is created by moving air. Sometimes, it is impractical to modify {{the sources of the}} noise, which requires designers to modify the path of the noise, the duct system. These modifications might include installing an in-duct silencer or <b>acoustical</b> <b>lining</b> on the inside walls of the ducts. The testing and the precise quantification of the performance of these silencers and duct linings are necessary for any designer {{to be able to make}} the correct modifications to the ventilation system. The ASTM E 477 code calls for strict standardization of the testing of such noise attenuation devices. The ASTM E 477 test facility used by the Center for Mechanical 2 ̆ 6 Environmental Systems Technology (CMEST) at UNLV was first constructed in 1991 and required upgrades to meet the newer revisions of the ASTM code. This study includes making modifications to the facility (1) to increase sound input, (2) reduce sound leakage, and (3) to integrate the measurement systems. These upgrades will bring the facility into compliance with the current version of the ASTM E 477 test standard...|$|E
40|$|<b>Acoustical</b> <b>lining</b> in {{aircraft}} engine nacelles {{is an effective}} method for reducing fan/compressor noise. Combined with duct acoustics, prediction of the noise reduction performance for a perforated non-locally reacting liner is conducted in this paper, and the sound reflection and radiation of a lined finite-length duct is studied. On the basis of mode analysis method, a model for sound propagation in an infinite-length lined duct is developed in this paper. Combined with the sound fields in the duct and liner, the eigenequation is obtained and numerically solved. The preliminary {{results showed that the}} noise reduction performance of non-locally reacting liners is superior to that of locally reacting liners in the low frequency band. By adjusting the bias flow velocity and cavity depth, the active control of the noise reduction performance can be achieved. A modified Boundary Element Method (BEM) used in this paper to solve the acoustic radiation of axisymmetric bodies is able to eliminate the nonuniqueness problem and is computational efficient. With boundary element method and mode matching method, a model for sound propagation and radiation of a finite-length duct is developed. However, the numerical procedure still needs to be improved. The theoretical analysis and numerical results of a finite-length duct lined with the non-locally reacting liner in this paper may be valuable for further developing and improving the nacelle acoustic design system...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{problem of}} an <b>acoustical</b> <b>line</b> source {{radiating}} over a planar multi layered material infinite {{in two of}} its dimensions, made up of acoustic, elastic and porous media is investigated. The fields in the different media are expanded into a superposition of plane waves using a one dimensional spatial Fourier transform along the material's interface. The problem amounts to solving for the reflection and transmission coefficients of the plane waves at each interface. The contributions of each wave are then recombined using the discrete wave number method, referred to as Bouchon's method, to get the fields in the media. The results given by the developed algorithm are successfully compared to an analytical solution considered for propagation above a locally reacting plan...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to develop both an accurate ‘reference’ measurement technique to determine ventilation rate through naturally ventilated buildings and a ‘practical’ direct measuring principle for online and continuous field measurements of ventilation rate through naturally ventilated sections. Using tracer-gas decay technique to analyse 444 laboratory experiments in a ventilated room with a ‘reference’ technique for scientific and calibration purposes revealed 35 % inaccuracy. Aside the assumption of perfectly mixing, zonal modelling approach {{has been used for}} post-processing of tracer-gas data and allowed 14 % inaccuracy even at low ventilation rates. To develop a measuring sensor for continuous use in farms with natural ventilation system, two measuring principles have been tested in laboratory conditions: 1) heat dissipation from the heat source at 17 different ventilation rates of a test room in comparison with an accurate ventilation reference measurement. This technique provided 15 % inaccuracy as an average of all laboratory experiments. 2) Transit time sonic anemometers were developed for a large scale section by using 16 <b>acoustical</b> <b>lines.</b> They were tested in a chimney with a large diameter (Φ = 0. 80 m) and a length of 1. 1 m. In total 980 experiments were realised in combination with a reference technique and resulted in 9 % inaccuracy even at disturbed flow conditions. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} analytical {{studies of}} internal noise generation and transmission in jet engines and its {{radiation from the}} duct ends. The propagation and generation of acoustic waves in a choked nozzle is considered first. Pressure and entropy fluctuations caused by gas stream non-uniformities like "hot spots," are incident on the nozzle entrance. A novel noise-generation mechanism is uncovered where acoustic waves are produced by a distribution of sources of strength proportional to the entrance entropy fluctuation and local gradient of the mean flow velocity. The propagation of acoustic waves in a moving medium {{in the presence of}} semi-infinite or finite boundaries is then considered. A transformation is introduced which relates the solutions of such problems to the solutions of associated problems in a stationary medium. The method is described by discussing the Sommerfeld problem of diffraction of a plane wave by a half plane immersed in a subsonically moving medium. When the plane has a trailing edge, it is shown that both reflection and shadow regions expand; while the opposite occurs for a leading edge,in which circumstance an additional diffracted wave also appears. In the supersonic case, all the diffraction problems are related to a single reference problem, solved by Fourier transform methods. A decomposition of the pressure field in a "geometrical optics" field and a diffracted field is given, showing some remarkable similarities with the subsonic case solution. The radiation of acoustic modes from a duct immersed in a subsonically moving medium is treated by a similar transform method. The presence of the uniform flow has roughly the same effect as an increase in frequency of the incident wave, at constant mode number. The effect of <b>acoustical</b> <b>lining</b> on the radiation pattern is examined, and side radiation is shown to be greatly reduced for the lower order modes. The transmission and reflection of acoustic waves incident on a blade row is analyzed by the transform method,and the transmission and reflection coefficients for the blade row immersed in a moving medium are expressed in terms of the basic acoustic characteristics of the blade row in a stationary medium...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{mounting}} a loudspeaker {{on one end}} of a sound-absorbing tube has existed since at least 1936. Surprisingly, a detailed mathematical analysis of the configuration has not been performed, nor has a design method been established. This configuration, known as a transmission line loudspeaker, has received little consideration in the reviewed literature. Instead, it has become frequently featured in magazines for audio hobbyists, where it is experimentally designed with rules seemingly derived from hearsay and described with terms of high praise. In this dissertation, an electro-acoustical model of a fiberglass-filled transmission line is presented. This model represents the transmission line as two separate lines [...] a mechanical line that models the mechanical motion of the fiberglass and an <b>acoustical</b> <b>line</b> that models the motion of the air. The lines are linked by the flow resistance of the fiberglass. From the model, solutions for the acoustic pressure, acoustical volume velocity of the air, mechanical velocity of the fiberglass fibers, and mechanical force on the fiberglass in the line are obtained. The fiberglass is characterized and empirical formulas that describe its characteristics are found. It is shown that the modeled input impedance to the transmission line is a good fit to measured data. The performance of the system is assessed by comparing it with the performances of typical loudspeaker mountings, i. e., the infinite baffle, the closed box, and the vented box. Finally, an example is shown of how the equations derived from the model can be used to evaluate the design of a transmission line loudspeaker system. Ph. D.

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{analytical}} study are reported which shows the effect of various physical and operating parameters on noise produced by low pressure ratio propulsive fans operating at subsonic top speeds. <b>Acoustical</b> duct <b>lining</b> effects {{are included in the}} study. The concepts used to develop the noise theory used in the study, as well as the correlation between the theory and model test results are also presented. It is shown that good correlation has been established between theory and experiment. Using the theory, it is shown that good aerodynamic design, maximum acceptable fan solidity, low tip speed operation and use of few blades and vanes leads to the lowest noise levels. Typical results of the study indicate that a fan operating at 1. 2 fan pressure ratio and 700 ft/second tip speed with 12 blades and 7 vanes and including modest acoustic treatment on the duct wall would produce levels allowing a 100, 000 lb.

40|$|The {{problem of}} <b>acoustical</b> {{transmission}} in <b>lined</b> ducts with subsonic mean flow is of considerable practical {{interest in the}} context of fan noise attenuation in the ducted inlet regions of turbofan aircraft engines. If nonaxisymmetric liners are present, a loss of axial symmetry results, and the study of acoustic transmission involves the solution of a full two-dimensional eigenvalue problem. The reported investigation is concerned with such an eigenvalue problem. The employed method of solution is effectively a two-dimensional analog of an approach considered by Astley and Eversman (1979). The approach makes use of a Galerkin Finite Element Method whereby the weighting and basis functions are generated automatically by the discretization...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{acoustic}} {{delay line}} is usually used to supply protection from dangerous environment, to enhance signal intensity by fit geometry of analyte, or to achieve specific angle/focusing by Snell's law, but rarely to avoid noise from coupling agent and to raise spatial resolution by reducing contact area. This study is focused on wedge waves with applications in delay-line to solve the knot of traditionally transducer measurement. Wedge waves are guided acoustic waves propagating along {{the tip of a}} wedge. The advantages of wedge being used in {{acoustic delay line}} are wedge waves has large motion amplitude of anti-symmetric flexural (ASF) mode, low energy attenuation and the velocity of ASF more is regular weather frequency varied or not.

Ejector lining design technology and <b>acoustical</b> scaling of <b>lined</b> ejector configurations were the major objectives. Ground static tests were {{run with a}} J- 75 turbojet engine fitted with a 37 -tube, area ratio 3. 3 suppressor nozzle and two lengths of ejector shroud (L/D = 1 and 2). Seven ejector lining configurations were tested over the engine pressure ratio range of 1. 40 to 2. 40 with corresponding jet velocities between 305 and 610 M/sec. One-fourth scale model nozzles were tested over a pressure ratio range of 1. 40 to 4. 0 with jet total temperatures between ambient and 1088 K. Scaling of multielement nozzle ejector configurations was also studied using a single element of the nozzle array with identical ejector lengths and lining materials.

40|$|With the {{emerging}} use of tracheal sound analysis {{to detect and}} monitor respiratory tract changes such as those found in asthma and obstructive sleep apnea, {{there is a need}} to link the attributes of these easily measured sounds first to the underlying anatomy, and then to specific pathophysiology. To begin this process, we have developed a model of the acoustic properties of the entire respiratory tract (supraglottal plus subglottal airways) over the frequency range of tracheal sound measurements, 100 to 3, 000 Hz. The respiratory tract is represented by a transmission <b>line</b> <b>acoustical</b> analogy with varying cross sectional area, yielding walls, dichotomous branching in the subglottal component, and airflow related acoustical sources distributed throughout the entire respiratory tract. The model predicts the location in frequency of the natural acoustic resonances for components and the entire tract. Individually, the supra and subglottal portions of the model predict well the distinct locations of the spectral peaks (formants) from speech sounds (such as /a/) measured at the mouth and the trachea, respectively, in healthy subjects. When combining the supra- and subglottic portions to form a complete tract model, the predicted peak locations compare favorably with those of tracheal sounds measured during normal breathing. In addition, the model predicts changes in the spectral amplitude of tracheal sounds that are observed experimentally for varying degrees of tracheal obstruction and volumetric airflow rates. This study provides the first insights into the complex relationships between the spectral peaks and amplitudes of tracheal sounds, volumetric airflow, and the underlying anatomy of the respiratory tract. ...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [86]- 89) Active {{noise control}} {{has been the}} subject of considerable research in recent years. A large portion of this work has been directed toward the active control of noise in ducts because of potential widespread industrial applications and the feasibility of building experimental systems. In this thesis, a complete analytical model using the <b>acoustical</b> transmission <b>line</b> theory is developed which allows the calculation of the transfer function of individual paths in a duct ANC system for estimating the performance of the system. Three different secondary source arrangements were evaluated in the duct ANC system. Measurements of plant and error path transfer functions agree well with theoretical predictions. For the tree-shaped system, it is shown that the significant performance improvement is achieved at the difficult node frequencies due to the symmetry arrangement of the secondary sources. For the T-shaped and Y-shaped systems, an audio equalizer can compensate for the imperfections in the error path, thus increasing the noise reduction of the systems. This approach is made from a hardware point of view to improve the performance and control the spectral contents of the residual error in the systems. In this thesis, a new algorithm called the filtered-E LMS algorithm is developed to use the filtered error to adapt the coefficients of the FIR filter. The application of this algorithm to active noise control is discussed, by which the suitably chosen shaping filter is able to give the residual noise a desired spectral content. The analysis shows that, in some applications, a slow convergence may be expected. Computer simulations demonstrate that this method can not only attenuate the noise level, but can also effectively reshape the spectrum of the residual noise. It performs well for both narrow band and broad band noise. Most active noise control systems may be treated as system identification problems in which adaptive filters are used to model the responses of unknown electroacoustic plants. For the system identification, it is demonstrated that the signal with the lower peak factor and more concentrated power band can be used as a training signal. The analysis also demonstrates that, for a chirp signal, the time duration affects the performance of system modeling. Some music is able to work in modeling an unknown system and a more stable convergence can be achieved. In addition, an integrated 3 D ANC with audio system benefits from the use of music on an on-line basis while the system is operating. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R
