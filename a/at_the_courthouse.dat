Dewey was convicted of the crime on August 21, 1966.|$|E
5|$|On that day, {{before the}} hearing, {{prosecutors}} filed a bail report and supplementary document under seal. (Such reports are often filed under seal because they include financial {{information about a}} defendant and sometimes unreleased details relating to the investigation).

5|$|In October 1984, Gardner killed Melvyn John Otterstrom {{during a}} robbery in Salt Lake City. While being moved in April 1985 {{to a court}} hearing for the homicide, he fatally shot {{attorney}} Michael Burdell in an unsuccessful escape attempt. Convicted of two counts of murder, Gardner {{was sentenced to life}} imprisonment for the first count and received the death penalty for the second. The state adopted more stringent security measures {{as a result of the}} incident <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse.</b> While held at Utah State Prison, Gardner was charged with another capital crime for stabbing an inmate in 1994. However, that charge was thrown out by the Utah Supreme Court because the victim survived.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, Lawrence Johnson, {{a member}} of Waco's city council, viewed {{pictures}} of the Washington lynching at the National Civil Rights Museum, and began to lobby for {{a monument to the}} lynching. In 2002, Lester Gibson, another member of the city council, proposed that a plaque be installed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse</b> where Washington was lynched. He further stated that the plaque should carry an apology from the city. The ideas were discussed, but proved unfruitful. In the 2000s, the idea of a memorial was revived by a McLennan County commissioner and the Waco Chamber of Commerce; the Waco Herald Tribune has editorialized in support of a historical marker {{on the site of the}} lynching. Some descendants of Fryer objected to the proposed memorial.|$|E

5|$|Through 1866, Greeley editorialized that Davis, who {{was being}} held at Fortress Monroe, should either be set free or put on trial. Davis's wife Varina urged Greeley to use his {{influence}} to gain her husband's release. In May 1867, a Richmond judge set bail for the former Confederate president at $100,000. Greeley {{was among those who}} signed the bail bond, and the two men met briefly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse.</b> This act resulted in public anger against Greeley in the North. Sales of the second volume of his history (published in 1866) declined sharply. Subscriptions to the Tribune (especially the Weekly Tribune) also dropped off, though they recovered during the 1868 election.|$|E
5|$|When Kamehameha V died in 1872 with no heir, the 1864 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii {{called for}} the {{legislature}} to select the next monarch. By both popular vote and the unanimous vote in the legislature, Lunalilo became the first elected king of Hawaii. Lunalilo died without an heir in 1874. In the election that followed, Liliʻuokalani's brother, David Kalākaua, ran against Emma, the dowager Queen of Kamehameha IV. The choice of Kalākaua by the legislature, and the subsequent announcement, caused a riot <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>courthouse.</b> US and British troops were landed, and some of Emma's supporters were arrested. The results of the election strained the relationship between Emma and the Kalākaua family.|$|E

25|$|As {{presiding}} judge, he {{was often}} seen carrying case files, insisting on reading each one in its entirety before assignment to a trial judge.
