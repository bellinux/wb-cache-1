25|$|In 1986, Guinness PLC was in {{the midst}} of a bidding war for the much larger Distillers Company. In the closing stages, Guinness' stock rose 25 percent â€” which was unusual, since the stock of the {{acquiring}} company usually falls in a takeover situation. Guinness paid several people and institutions, most notably American <b>arbitrageur</b> Ivan Boesky, about $38million USD to buy $300USD million worth of Guinness stock. The effect was to increase the value of its offer for Distillers, whose management favored merging with Guinness.|$|E
25|$|Ivan Boesky was a Wall Street <b>arbitrageur</b> who had {{amassed a}} fortune of about $200 million by betting on {{corporate}} takeovers. He was {{investigated by the}} U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for making investments based on tips received from corporate insiders. These stock and options acquisitions were sometimes brazen, with massive purchases occurring {{only a few days}} before a corporation announced a takeover. Although insider trading of this kind was illegal, laws prohibiting it were rarely enforced until Boesky was prosecuted. Boesky cooperated with the SEC and informed on several others, including junk bond trader Michael Milken. Per agreement with Giuliani, Boesky received a -year prison sentence along with a $100 million fine. In 1989, Giuliani charged Milken under the RICO Act with 98 counts of racketeering and fraud. In a highly publicized case, Milken was indicted by a grand jury on these charges.|$|E

In our model, arbitrage activity benefits all investors because <b>arbitrageurs</b> supply liquidity to the market.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} the theoretical foundation that underlies {{the willingness of}} rational <b>arbitrageurs</b> to delay and reinforce the speculative attack. The key assumptions are {{that there is a}} small probability that <b>arbitrageurs</b> are behavioral and never time the market of their own accord and it is uncertain whether <b>arbitrageurs</b> are behavioral or rational. We model a stock market as a timing game, in which <b>arbitrageurs</b> compete to react quickest. We show that rational <b>arbitrageurs</b> are willing to ride the bubble for a long period. We also characterize symmetric Nash equilibria and show the sufficient condition for uniqueness. a further revision was accepted in the Journal of Economic Theory...|$|R
40|$|This paper models {{the impact}} of <b>arbitrageurs</b> on stock prices when <b>arbitrageurs</b> are {{uncertain}} about the drift of the dividend process of a risky asset. Under perfect information, the presence of risk-neutral <b>arbitrageurs</b> unambiguously reduces the volatility of asset returns. When <b>arbitrageurs</b> are uncertain about the drift of the dividend process, they condition their investment strategy on the observation of dividends and trading volume. In such a setting, the presence of <b>arbitrageurs</b> can {{lead to an increase}} in the equilibrium volatility of asset returns. The arbitrageurs' inference problem gives rise to rich dynamics of asset prices and investment strategies: the optimal trading strategy of <b>arbitrageurs</b> can be upward sloping in prices, the response of prices to news can be nonlinear, and minor news can have large effects. These results are driven by the arbitrageurs' inability to perfectly distinguish temporary from permanent shocks. <b>Arbitrageurs</b> would like to sell assets in response to temporary price increases and buy assets in response to permanent price increases.

500|$|Drexel Burnham Lambert was the {{investment}} bank {{most responsible for}} the boom in private equity during the 1980s due to its leadership in the issuance of high-yield debt. [...] The firm was first rocked by scandal on May 12, 1986, when Dennis Levine, a Drexel managing director and investment banker, was charged with insider trading. [...] Levine pleaded guilty to four felonies, and implicated one of his recent partners, <b>arbitrageur</b> Ivan Boesky. [...] Largely based on information Boesky promised to provide about his dealings with Milken, the Securities and Exchange Commission initiated an investigation of Drexel on November 17.

500|$|A {{significant}} {{scene in}} the film is a speech by Gekko to a shareholders' meeting of Teldar Paper, a company he is planning to take over. Stone uses this scene to give Gekko, and by extension, the Wall Street raiders he personifies, the chance to justify their actions, portraying himself as a liberator of the company value from the ineffective and excessively compensated executives. The inspiration for the [...] "Greed is good" [...] speech seems {{to have come from}} two sources. The first part, where Gekko complains that the company's management owns less than three percent of its stock, and that it has too many vice presidents, is taken from similar speeches and comments made by Carl Icahn about companies he was trying to take over. The defense of greed is a paraphrase of the May 18, 1986, commencement address at the UC Berkeley's School of Business Administration, delivered by <b>arbitrageur</b> Ivan Boesky (who himself was later convicted of insider trading charges), in which he said, [...] "Greed is all right, by the way.

40|$|We {{present a}} model where <b>arbitrageurs</b> operate on an asset market {{that can be}} hit by {{information}} shocks. Before entering the market, <b>arbitrageurs</b> are allowed to optimize their capital structure, {{in order to take}} advantage of potential underpricing. We find that, at equilibrium, some <b>arbitrageurs</b> always receive funding, even in low information environ-ments. Other <b>arbitrageurs</b> only receive funding in high information environments. The model makes two easily testable predictions: first, <b>arbitrageurs</b> with stable funding should experience more mean reversion in returns, in particular following low performance. Sec-ond, this larger mean reversion should be lower, if many other funds have stable funding. We test these predictions on a sample of hedge funds, some of which impose impediments to withdrawal to their investors. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} studies the general {{equilibrium}} implications of arbitrage trades by strategic players in segmented financial markets. <b>Arbitrageurs</b> exploit client`ele effects and choose {{to specialize in}} one category of trades, taking into consideration all other arbitrage strategies. This results in an equilibrium network of <b>arbitrageurs.</b> The optimal network for <b>arbitrageurs</b> is of the hub-spoke kind. The equilibrium network, in contrast, is never optimal for <b>arbitrageurs</b> and is never hub-spoke. The reason is that equilibrium networks suffer from a Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma problem that prevents network externalities from being internalized.

2500|$|When the {{investor}} is long the asset and short the portfolio (or vice versa) {{he has created}} a position which has a positive expected return (the difference between asset return and portfolio return) and which has a net-zero exposure to any macroeconomic factor and is therefore risk free (other than for firm specific risk).

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a theory of}} strategic trading in markets with large <b>arbitrageurs.</b> If <b>arbitrageurs</b> are not well capitalized, capital constraints make their trades predictable. Other market participants can exploit this by trading against them. Competitors may find it optimal to lend to <b>arbitrageurs</b> that are financially fragile; additional capital makes the <b>arbitrageurs</b> more viable, and lenders can reap profits from trading against them for a longer time. The strategic behavior of these market participants has implications for the functioning of financial markets. Strategic trading may produce significant price distortions, increase price manipulation, and trigger forced liquidations of large traders. Copyright 2005 by The American Finance Association. ...|$|R
40|$|The UK context {{with its}} {{distinct}} regulation on information disclosure during the takeover period {{provides an excellent}} setting to examine how the regulation can affect the roles that <b>arbitrageurs</b> can play in the takeover game. Using a manually-collected dataset {{and a variety of}} methods to tackle the endogeneity problem, we find supporting evidence on the importance of disclosure regulation. The UK strict disclosure rule makes it hard for <b>arbitrageurs</b> to outperform the average investors in the market. Furthermore, being forced to reveal their identity too soon, the presence of <b>arbitrageurs</b> actually reduces bid premium. There is little evidence that <b>arbitrageurs</b> can exert influence on the chance that the bid can go through. ...|$|R
50|$|Consider {{a simple}} world {{where there are}} two types of investors - Individuals and <b>Arbitrageurs.</b> Individual investors have limited {{investment}} opportunities in terms of relatively limited access to capital and limited information while sophisticated â€œarbitrageurs â€œ (e.g.: dealers, hedge funds, investment banks) have access to better investment opportunities over individual investors due to greater access to capital and better information. Arbitrage opportunities are created when there are differences in asset prices. Individual investors are not able to take advantage of these arbitrage opportunities but <b>arbitrageurs</b> can, due to better information and greater access to capital. Leverage allows <b>arbitrageurs</b> to take on significantly more positions. However, due to margin requirements, even <b>arbitrageurs</b> may potentially face financial constraints and may not be able to completely eliminate the arbitrage opportunities.|$|R
2500|$|The SEC {{inquiries}} {{never got}} beyond the investigation phase until 1986, when <b>arbitrageur</b> Ivan Boesky {{pleaded guilty to}} securities fraud {{as part of a}} larger insider trading investigation. [...] As part of his plea, Boesky implicated Milken in several illegal transactions, including insider trading, stock manipulation, fraud and stock parking (buying stocks for the benefit of another). [...] This led to an SEC probe of Drexel, as well as a separate criminal probe by Rudy Giuliani, then United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. [...] Although both investigations were almost entirely focused on Milken's department, Milken refused to talk with Drexel (which launched its own internal investigation) except through his lawyers.|$|E
2500|$|Giuliani's critics claim he {{arranged}} public arrests of people, then dropped charges {{for lack of}} evidence on high-profile cases rather than going to trial. In a few cases, his public arrests of alleged white-collar criminals at their workplaces with charges later dropped or lessened, sparked controversy, and damaged the reputations of the alleged [...] "perps". He claimed veteran stock trader Richard Wigton, of Kidder, Peabody & Co., was guilty of insider trading; in February 1987 he had officers handcuff Wigton and march him through the company's trading floor, with Wigton in tears. Giuliani had his agents arrest Tim Tabor, a young <b>arbitrageur</b> and former colleague of Wigton, so late {{that he had to}} stay overnight in jail before posting bond.|$|E
2500|$|Under this approach, {{the bond}} price should reflect its [...] "arbitrage-free" [...] price, as any {{deviation}} from this price will be exploited and the bond will then quickly reprice to its correct level. Here, we apply the rational pricing logic relating to [...] "Assets with identical cash flows". In detail: (1) the bond's coupon dates and coupon amounts are known with certainty. Therefore, (2) some multiple (or fraction) of zero-coupon bonds, each {{corresponding to the}} bond's coupon dates, can be specified so as to produce identical cash flows to the bond. Thus (3) the bond price today must be equal to the sum of each of its cash flows discounted at the discount rate implied by {{the value of the}} corresponding ZCB. [...] Were this not the case, (4) the <b>arbitrageur</b> could finance his purchase of whichever of the bond or the sum of the various ZCBs was cheaper, by short selling the other, and meeting his cash flow commitments using the coupons or maturing zeroes as appropriate. Then (5) his [...] "risk free", arbitrage profit would be {{the difference between the two}} values.|$|E

50|$|Also {{known as}} {{geographical}} arbitrage, {{this is the}} simplest form of arbitrage. In spatial arbitrage, an <b>arbitrageur</b> looks for price differences between geographically separate markets.

For whatever reason, the two dealers have not spotted the difference in the prices, but the <b>arbitrageur</b> does. The <b>arbitrageur</b> immediately buys the bond from the Virginia dealer and sells it to the Washington dealer.|$|E
