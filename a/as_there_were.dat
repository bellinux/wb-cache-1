5|$|A legend {{developed}} that England would not fall {{to a foreign}} invader as long <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> ravens at the Tower of London; although this is often thought to be an ancient belief, the official Tower of London historian, Geoff Parnell, believes that {{this is actually a}} romantic Victorian invention.|$|E
5|$|Vice President Hubert Humphrey {{attended}} King's funeral {{on behalf}} of the President, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> fears that Johnson's presence might incite protests and perhaps violence.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> {{no further}} goals, the match was decided by a penalty shoot-out. Wright and Denis Irwin missed their penalties; the decisive penalty, taken by Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman, was saved by his {{opposite}} number, Peter Schmeichel. Arsenal manager George Graham admitted his surprise {{over how the}} game was decided and thought both clubs would share the trophy; his counterpart Alex Ferguson, though delighted with his team's victory, felt the sudden death aspect was unnecessary.|$|E

50|$|Approach {{from the}} east <b>is</b> rare, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a wide expanse of heather-covered moorland with no roads in that direction. Approach from the north is not {{possible}} for walkers, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no path between the crags.|$|R
50|$|The {{territories of}} Yukon, Nunavut, and Northwest Territories use no exit numbers, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no freeways or expressways in the territories. Prince Edward Island has no exit numbers either, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> only one {{interchange}} in the province.|$|R
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> {{no local}} stakes in Canada at the time, Monson was {{responsible}} for both the missionaries and all LDS Church operations in the area. When he became mission president, he oversaw 130 missionaries and 55 church branches divided into 9 districts. During his tenure, the number of missionaries peaked at 180. Historically, most districts and branches in the area had been presided over by full-time missionaries, but Monson placed local members as presidents of branches and districts soon after arriving.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the French Revolution in 1789 there were eight times as many slaves in the colony <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> white and mixed-race people put together. In 1789 the French were importing 30,000 slaves a year and there were half a million slaves in the French part of the island alone, compared to about 30,000 whites.|$|E
5|$|Between December, 1941 and June, 1945 U.S. railroads carried almost 44 million armed {{services}} personnel. <b>As</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> not enough cars and coaches available {{to meet the}} massive need for troop transit created by World War II, in late 1943 the U.S. Office of Defense Transportation contracted with the Pullman Company to build 2,400 troop sleepers, and with American Car and Foundry (ACF) to build 440 troop kitchen cars.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{the founders}} of Cubist theory, objects possess no {{absolute}} or essential form. [...] "There are as many images of an object <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> eyes which look at it; <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> many essential images of it <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> minds which comprehend it." ...|$|R

5|$|Booth had a low key {{season in}} 195556, {{struggling}} to find a regular position in the New South Wales team. <b>As</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no international matches during the summer, the Test players were available for the whole campaign. He played in six matches and had few opportunities, managing only 157 runs at 31.40, passing fifty on only one occasion. New South Wales went on to claim a hat-trick of Sheffield Shield titles.|$|E
5|$|Chiswick {{grew up as}} {{a village}} around St Nicholas Church from c. 1181 on Church Street, its {{inhabitants}} practising farming, fishing and other riverside trades including a ferry, important <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no bridges between London Bridge and Kingston throughout the Middle Ages. The area included three other small settlements, the fishing village of Strand-on-the-Green, Little Sutton and Turnham Green on the west road out of London.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} in September and October 2004. Although the story is set in 19th century Cardiff, the {{production}} was actually filmed in Swansea and Monmouth, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> not enough Victorian-looking buildings left in Cardiff. Cardiff's New Theatre {{was used for the}} theatre in which Dickens is telling a story {{at the beginning of the}} episode. An empty Victorian children's home in Penarth was used for Sneed's parlour. Based on research of Victorian morgues, the production team selected red and sepia as the main color scheme.|$|E

5000|$|The precise {{population}} of Brown Stone <b>is</b> unknown, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no census conducted {{specifically to the}} neighborhood. But the population density {{is known to be}} significantly lower than the Beijing high average, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> only 25 4-5 story townhouses in the huge 101900 m2 close neighborhood.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the launch}} of British Airways Concorde services, Britain's other major airline, British Caledonian (BCal), set up a task force headed by Gordon Davidson, BA's former Concorde director, to {{investigate}} the possibility of their own Concorde operations. This was seen as particularly viable for the airline's long-haul network <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> two unsold aircraft then available for purchase.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} the {{congregation}} was not unified. However, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> only about 50 Jews in Jackson in 1868, {{the community was}} too small for two synagogues. Conflicts arose between the older German Jewish members and post-American Civil War Jewish immigrants from Poland, particularly over synagogue ritual. The synagogue followed the Orthodox nusach Ashkenaz, but some members wanted to adopt Isaac Mayer Wise's reformist Minhag America Prayer-Book.|$|E
5|$|Fukuda's {{training}} method consisted mostly {{of the student}} taking fall after fall for the teacher or senior student until he began to understand {{the mechanics of the}} technique. Fukuda stressed applied technique over ritual form. He gave beginners a short description of the technique and had them engage in free practice (randori) in order to teach through experience. It was only after the student had attained some proficiency that he taught them traditional forms (kata). This method was difficult, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no special mats for falling, only the standard straw mats (tatami) laid over wooden floors.|$|E

5|$|Further {{works were}} carried out to repair, rebuild and improve the defences around the Waterport Front, which {{incorporated}} the old Waterport Gate. New casemates, counterguards, tenailles and lunettes {{were built in the}} area and the Montagu and Orange Bastions were enlarged. The work was carried out amidst considerable controversy, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> vigorous disagreements between the governors and senior engineers of the time over how the works should be carried out and indeed whether some of them should be pursued at all.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 {{there were}} only three primary schools in Bintulu. These schools {{provided}} classes until Primary3 level. There were no secondary schools. Villagers could pursue their secondary school studies at either Miri or Kuching by using small boats <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no roads connecting Bintulu to either Miri or Kuching. Bintulu Government Secondary School was opened in 1964. In 1967 Bintulu celebrated the first 100 years of the Council Negri meeting (Sarawak State Legislative Assembly). A stone monument was built in front of a government rice storeroom to commemorate the event. Bintulu was a sub-district of Miri Division in the 1970s. The sub-district was upgraded into a district in 1987.|$|E
5|$|In May 2013 the {{investigation}} board was {{made aware of}} that two passengers had each their Mobira NMT-450 mobile telephone {{with them on the}} flights. As this had not been mentioned in the original report, AIBN conducted a review of the issue and especially if the telephones could have influenced the vertical navigation. They concluded in December that this was not the case, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no indications of interferences and that there are no instances where electromagnetic interference has been a contributing cause to an aviation accident.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the war, Parliament ordered the slighting of castles across the country, deliberately destroying or damaging the structures to prevent them being used in any subsequent Royalist uprisings. North Wales proved to be a special case, <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> concerns that Charles II might lead a Presbyterian uprising in Scotland and mount a sea-borne attack on the region. Conwy, Caernarfon and Beaumaris were initially garrisoned by Parliament to defend against such an attack. Conwy was later partially slighted in 1655, but Caernarfon and Beaumaris escaped entirely. Harlech, less of a potential Scottish target, was rendered unusable by Parliament, but was not totally demolished.|$|E
5|$|On 24 March, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak {{appeared}} before media at 22:00 local {{time to give}} a statement regarding Flight 370, during which {{he announced that he}} had been briefed by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch that it and Inmarsat (the satellite data provider) had concluded that the airliner's last position before it disappeared was in the southern Indian Ocean. <b>As</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no places there where it could have landed, the aircraft must therefore have crashed into the sea.|$|E
5|$|On 26 May, while {{rounding}} {{the southern tip}} of Africa, Arniston separated from the convoy in bad weather after her sails were damaged. Without accurate daily longitudinal information from the other ships, Arniston had to rely instead on older, less accurate navigation methods. Navigation via dead reckoning proved particularly difficult <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> strong ocean currents combined with inclement weather that prevented a fix being obtained for several days via celestial navigation.|$|E
