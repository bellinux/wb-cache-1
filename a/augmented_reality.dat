5|$|Aloy {{was cast}} {{out from the}} Nora tribe at birth, raised by an outcast named Rost (JB Blanc). As a child, she {{obtained}} a Focus, a small <b>augmented</b> <b>reality</b> device that gives her special perceptive abilities. After coming of age, Aloy (Ashly Burch) enters a competition called the Proving to win the right to become a Nora Brave, and by extension, {{a member of the}} Nora tribe. Aloy wins the competition, but the Nora are suddenly attacked by cultists. Aloy is almost killed by their leader Helis (Crispin Freeman), but is saved by Rost, who sacrifices himself to save Aloy from a bomb. When Aloy awakes, a Matriarch explains that the cultists had gained control of corrupted machines. Aloy also learns that as an infant, she was found {{at the foot of a}} sealed door that the Nora worship, and was believed by some to be cursed, hence being cast out. An Oseram foreigner called Olin (Chook Sibtain) informs Aloy that the cultists are part of a fanatical religious group calling themselves the Eclipse. They worship a demon called HADES (John Gonzalez), who allows them to corrupt machines. Olin indicates that the reason Aloy was targeted by the Eclipse was due to her resemblance to an Old World scientist named Dr. Elisabet Sobeck (also voiced by Burch).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{an indoor}} {{positioning}} method is presented for self-localization of a mobile device by combining Wi-Fi wireless location, strap-down {{inertial navigation systems}} (SINS), <b>augment</b> <b>reality</b> and ultrasonic positioning. Over the last few years, inertial sensors with low cost and mobile devices equipped with a camera and microphone have become available. Although inertial sensors exhibit large errors, <b>augment</b> <b>reality</b> and ultrasonic positioning {{can be used to}} correct the drift error based on this technology. On the other hand, INS sensors can interact with the Wi-Fi positioning system as they provide high-accuracy real-time navigation. The localization algorithm based on reliability for a variety of information fusion processing is proposed to adapt different indoor environment. Finally, the benefits of the proposed architecture are evaluated and compared with the pure Wi-Fi positioning method...|$|R

40|$|Local {{electrical}} characterization has {{wide spectrum}} of applications in various areas. However, {{there are a number}} of difficulties that hinder the precise measurement of local electrical properties of samples, particularly those within nano-scale spatial resolution. Inspired by these challenges, we developed a nano-robot enabled electrical characterization system that can be utilized to pinpoint the local electrical properties of materials, devices, and bioentities with high spatial and electrical resolution. This system consists of an electrical characterization unit and a nano-robot with an <b>augment</b> <b>reality</b> system, which was developed from a traditional atomic force microscopy (AFM). The <b>augment</b> <b>reality</b> system provides real-time visual feedback. The real-time visual display integrated with the real-time force feedback from the nano-robot allows a precise control of the position and force of the AFM tips towards samples, which are significant for the sensitivity of local electrical measurement. The system design and implementation are presented in the paper. Experiments were carried out to study the local conductance of a multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWCNT), demonstrating the effectiveness of this system. © 2012 IEEE. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
