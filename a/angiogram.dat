5|$|People whose CT scan shows a large hematoma, {{depressed}} {{level of}} consciousness, or focal neurologic signs {{may benefit from}} urgent surgical removal of the blood or occlusion of the bleeding site. The remainder are stabilized more extensively and undergo a transfemoral <b>angiogram</b> or CT <b>angiogram</b> later. It is hard to predict who will have a rebleed, yet it may happen {{at any time and}} carries a dismal prognosis. After the first 24hours have passed, rebleeding risk remains around 40 percent over the subsequent fourweeks, suggesting that interventions should be aimed at reducing this risk as soon as possible. Some predictors of early rebleeding are high systolic blood pressure, the presence of a hematoma in the brain or ventricles, poor Hunt-Hess grade (III-IV), aneurysms in the posterior circulation, and an aneurysm >10mm in size.|$|E
5|$|Metformin is {{recommended}} to be temporarily discontinued before any radiographic study involving iodinated contrast agents, (such as a contrast-enhanced CT scan or <b>angiogram),</b> as the contrast dye may temporarily impair kidney function, indirectly leading to lactic acidosis by causing retention of metformin in the body.

5|$|In some instances, lumbar {{puncture}} {{may be required}} {{if there is a}} suspicion that the symptoms might be caused by other problems (meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage). This is the examination of the cerebrospinal fluid that envelops the brain and the spinal cord; the sample is obtained with a needle that is passed under local anesthetic into the spine. In pituitary apoplexy the results are typically normal, although abnormalities may be detected if blood from the pituitary has entered the subarachnoid space. If there is remaining doubt about the possibility of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a magnetic resonance <b>angiogram</b> (MRI with a contrast agent) may be required to identify aneurysms of the brain blood vessels, {{the most common cause of}} SAH.|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{interest}} is drawn on hemodynamic parameters for classifying {{the risk of}} rupture as well as treatment planning of cerebral aneurysms. A proposed method to obtain quantities such as wall shear stress, pressure, and blood flow velocity is to numerically simulate the blood flow using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods. For the validation of those calculated quantities, virtually generated <b>angiograms,</b> based on the CFD results, are increasingly used for a subsequent comparison with real, acquired <b>angiograms.</b> For the generation of virtual <b>angiograms,</b> several patient-specific parameters have to be incorporated to obtain virtual <b>angiograms</b> which match the acquired <b>angiograms</b> as best as possible.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{reproducibility}} of measurement of carotid stenosis {{and assessment of}} plaque surface morphology on 1001 <b>angiograms</b> from a consecutive series of patients entered into the European Carotid Surgery Trial. Inter-observer agreement (Kappa statistic, 95 % confidence interval (CI)) for categorization of carotid stenosis, as 0 - 29 %, 30 - 69 % or 70 - 99 % was good (0. 68, 0. 63 - 0. 73) on 789 conventional or digitally subtracted selective <b>angiograms,</b> and good (0. 64, 0. 54 - 0. 75) on 174 conventionally and digitally subtracted aortic arch injection <b>angiograms,</b> but was poor (0. 29, 0. 02 - 0. 80) on 29 intravenous digital subtraction <b>angiograms.</b> Inter-observer agreement did not vary with the method of image acquisition of arterial <b>angiograms,</b> but was dependent {{on the quality of}} visualization of the stenosis: kappa = 0. 73 (0. 67 - 0. 79) for good quality <b>angiograms</b> vs. 0. 54 (0. 44 - 0. 64) for poor quality <b>angiograms.</b> Inter-observer agreement for assessment of plaque surface morphology was moderate (kappa 0. 4 - 0. 6) and did not vary with type of angiography or method of image acquisition. However, ulceration was reported most frequently on selective <b>angiograms</b> and on those <b>angiograms</b> on which the quality of visualization of the stenosis was good. We conclude that the reproducibility of measurement of carotid stenosis and the assessment of plaque surface morphology vary {{depending on the type of}} angiography and the quality of visualization of the stenosis.

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{value of}} three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance (MR) angiography was prospectively evaluated in 26 patients with congenital intracranial vascular lesions; 12 had arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and 14 had venous angiomas. In the initial {{phase of the}} study the entire region of interest was imaged with one large acquisition volume (60 - 120 -mm-thick slab). Later, the <b>angiograms</b> were obtained with adjacent but slightly overlapping, 30 -mm-thick slabs, which clearly improved vascular detail. Gadolinium enhancement slightly improved depiction of veins but not of arteries. MR <b>angiograms</b> were compared with available conventional <b>angiograms</b> and MR studies. The topography of the AVM nidus was equally well appreciated on the MR as on the conventional <b>angiograms.</b> However, in six of 12 patients the hyperdynamic afferent arteries were incompletely shown on MR <b>angiograms</b> because of incomplete rephrasing. In three patients, venous drainage was also incompletely visualized. Compared with conventional MR studies, MR angiography offered the same detection rate but better anatomic insight.

5|$|Some {{treatments}} for stroke are time-critical. These include clot dissolution or surgical {{removal of a}} clot for ischaemic strokes, and decompression for haemorrhagic strokes. As stroke is time critical, hospitals and even pre-hospital care of stroke involves expedited investigations – usually a CT scan to investigate for a haemorrhagic stroke and a CT or MR <b>angiogram</b> to evaluate arteries that supply the brain. MRI scans, not as widely available, {{may be able to}} demonstrate the affected area of the brain more accurately, particularly with ischaemic stroke.|$|E
5|$|In 15–20 {{percent of}} cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, no aneurysm is detected on the first <b>angiogram.</b> About half of these are attributed to non-aneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage, in which the blood {{is limited to the}} subarachnoid spaces around the midbrain (i.e. mesencephalon). In these, the origin of the blood is uncertain. The remainder are due to other disorders affecting the blood vessels (such as cerebral arteriovenous malformations), disorders of the blood vessels in the spinal cord, and bleeding into various tumors. Cocaine abuse and sickle cell anemia (usually in children) and, rarely, anticoagulant therapy, problems with blood clotting and pituitary apoplexy can also result in SAH. Dissection of the vertebral artery, usually caused by trauma, can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage if the dissection involves the part of the vessel inside the skull.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we qualitatively compare the flow {{structures}} observed in cerebral aneurysms using conventional angiography and virtual <b>angiograms</b> produced from patient-specific computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. For this purpose, high frame rate biplane <b>angiograms</b> were obtained during a rapid injection of contrast agent in three patients with intracranial aneurysms. Patient-specific CFD models were then constructed from 3 D rotational angiography images of each aneurysm. Time dependent flow fields {{were obtained from the}} numerical solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations under pulsatile flow conditions derived from phase-contrast magnetic resonance measurements performed on normal subjects. These flow fields were subsequently used to simulate the transport of a contrast agent by solving the advection-diffusion equation. Both the fluid and transport equations were solved with an implicit finite element formulation on unstructured grids. Virtual <b>angiograms</b> were then constructed by volume rendering of the simulated dye concentration field. The flow structures observed in the conventional and virtual <b>angiograms</b> were then qualitatively compared. It was found that the finite element models showed distinct flow types for each aneurysm, ranging from simple to complex. The virtual <b>angiograms</b> showed good agreement with the images from the conventional <b>angiograms</b> for all three aneurysms. Analogous size and orientation of the inflow jet, regions of flow impaction, major intraaneurysmal vortices and regions of outflow were observed in both the conventional and virtual <b>angiograms.</b> In conclusion, patient-specific image-based computational models of intracranial aneurysms can realistically reproduce the major intraaneurysmal flow structures observed with conventional angiography...|$|R

40|$|A new noninvasive MRI {{method for}} vessel {{selective}} angiography is presented. The technique combines vessel-encoded pseudocontinuous {{arterial spin labeling}} with a two-dimensional dynamic angiographic readout and was used to image the cerebral arteries in healthy volunteers. Time-of-flight <b>angiograms</b> were also acquired prior to vessel-selective dynamic angiography acquisitions in axial, coronal, and/or sagittal planes, using a 3 -T MRI scanner. The latter consisted of a vessel-encoded pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling pulse train of 300 or 1000 ms followed by a two-dimensional thick-slab flow-compensated fast low angle shot readout combined with a segmented Look-Locker sampling strategy (temporal resolution = 55 ms). Selective labeling was performed {{at the level of}} the neck to generate individual <b>angiograms</b> for both right and left internal carotid and vertebral arteries. Individual vessel <b>angiograms</b> were reconstructed using a bayesian inference method. The vessel-selective dynamic <b>angiograms</b> obtained were consistent with the time-of-flight images, and the longer of the two vessel-encoded pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling pulse train durations tested (1000 ms) was found to give better distal vessel visibility. This technique provides highly selective <b>angiograms</b> quickly and noninvasively that could potentially be used in place of intra-arterial x-ray angiography for larger vessels...|$|R

40|$|For {{accurate}} {{analysis of}} serial coronary <b>angiograms</b> {{in a given}} patient over time, {{it is important to}} acquire paired <b>angiograms</b> recorded in exactly the same condition. Using the automatic gantry setting, we evaluated the geometric reproducibility of coronary <b>angiograms</b> and the reproducibility of vessel measurements in serial quantitative coronary angiography. Coronary <b>angiograms</b> of 40 patitents who underwent PTCA were analyzed before PTCA, after PTCA (medium-term) and at follow-up (long-term). The geometric reproducibility of coronary <b>angiograms</b> was assessed by comparing 120 angles between the major coronary branches. Reproducibility on vessel analysis was evaluated by measuring the minimal lumen diameter (MLD) of 120 non-dilated segments. Differences in the angles of the X-ray gantry were small and the standard deviation of the differences was not more than 0. 5 degrees. The differences in the measurements of the angles between the major coronary branches were 0. 1 ± 1. 2 degrees in the same frame pre-PTCA, 0. 1 ± 3. 4 degrees between pre- and post-PTCA, and 0. 8 ± 4. 7 degrees between pre-PTCA and at follow-up. The differences in MLD were 0. 01 ± 0. 10, 0. 01 ± 0. 17, and 0. 05 ± 0. 19 mm, respectively. The automatic gantry setting provides good reproductibility of the X-ray imaging position. However, the geometric reproducibility of coronary <b>angiograms</b> and the reproducibility of vessel measurements show some variability in the medium- and long-term. This variability seems to be affected by uncontrollable factors such as heart motion or respiration...|$|R

25|$|Findings {{on general}} {{investigations}} (such as blood tests) are not specific for cholesterol embolism, which makes diagnosis difficult. The {{main problem is}} the distinction between cholesterol embolism and vasculitis (inflammation of the small blood vessels), which may cause very similar symptoms - especially the skin findings and the kidney dysfunction. Worsening kidney function after an <b>angiogram</b> may also be attributed to kidney damage by substances used during the procedure (contrast nephropathy). Other causes {{that may lead to}} similar symptoms include ischemic renal failure (kidney dysfunction due to an interrupted blood supply), a group of diseases known as thrombotic microangiopathies and endocarditis (infection of the heart valves with small clumps of infected tissue embolizing through the body).|$|E
30|$|Interpretation of {{coronary}} <b>angiograms</b> is also subject to observer variability.

This problem of variability needs to be addressed, regardless of whether coronary angiography or MPS is used as the reference.

40|$|Coronary {{arterial}} tree extraction in <b>angiograms</b> is {{an essential}} component of each cardiac image processing system. Once physicians decide to check up coronary arteries from x-ray <b>angiograms,</b> extraction must be done precisely, fast, automatically and including whole arterial tree to help diagnosis or treatment during the cardiac surgical operation. This application is very helpful for the surgeon on deciding the target vessels prior to coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Some techniques and algorithms are proposed for extracting coronary arteries in <b>angiograms.</b> However, most of them suffer from some disadvantages such as time complexity, low accuracy, extracting only parts of main arteries instead of the full coronary arterial tree, need manual segmentation, appearance of artifacts and so forth. This study presents a new method for extracting whole coronary arterial tree in angiography images using Starlet wavelet transform. To this end, firstly we remove noise from raw <b>angiograms</b> and then sharpen the coronary arteries. Then coronary arterial tree is extracted by applying a modified Starlet wavelet transform and afterwards the residual noises and artifacts are cleaned.

25|$|VATS (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) is a minimally-invasive {{technique}} to resect lung nodules that saves the patient {{the trauma of}} a thoracotomy. Thereby, small ports are used to access the pulmonary lobes and introduce a camera on a thoracoscope, along with the necessary instruments. While this procedure speeds up recovery and potentially reduces complications, the loss of natural vision and tactile sensing {{makes it difficult for}} the surgeon to locate the nodules, especially in cases of non-superficial, ground-glass opaque, and small lesions. The yield rate for nodules < 1nbsp&cm can be below 40% as studies show. As a consequence sometimes more healthy tissue is resected than actually necessary in order to avoid missing (parts of) the lesion. Using advanced intra-operative imaging in the OR helps to precisely locate and resect the lesion in a potentially tissue-sparing and quick fashion. In {{order to be able to}} use image guidance during VATS, rotational angiography has to be performed before the introduction of ports, thus before the lobe in question deflates. This way the lesion is visible through the natural contrast of air. In a second step, hook wires, thread needles, or contrast agent (Lipiodol, Iopamidol) are introduced into or next to the lesion to ensure visibility on the <b>angiogram</b> after lung deflation. Then, the conventional part of VATS starts with the introduction of thoracoscopes. The imaging system is used in fluoroscopic mode now, where both the inserted instruments and the previously marked lesion are well visible. A precise resection is now possible. In case contrast agent has been used to mark the lesion, it will also drain into the regional lymph nodes, which then can be resected within the same procedure.|$|E
