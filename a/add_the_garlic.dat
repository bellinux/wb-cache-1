40|$|The {{deodorizing}} {{activity of}} dokudami (Houttuyniacordata Thunb.) for masking {{the odor of}} fresh garlic was investigated, and the volatility of the deodorizing compounds was examined. Two grams of garlic {{was placed in a}} beaker and heated for 5 min at 40 °C. Next, aliquots of 0. 01 and 0. 05 g of powdered samples of seven plants (dokudami, thyme, rosemary, coriander, dandelion, spiny sow thistle and green tea) were mixed with 1 ml of volatile or non-volatile dokudami extract and <b>added</b> to <b>the</b> <b>garlic</b> sample. <b>The</b> <b>garlic</b> odor intensity was subsequently evaluated by sniffing by 10 trained individuals. The deodorizing activity test was carried out at 0, 3 and 6 h after <b>adding</b> <b>the</b> dokudami extract. The deodorizing effect of dokudami on masking <b>garlic</b> odor was <b>the</b> highest of any plant and became higher with increased dose. In addition, the deodorizing activity of dokudami increased with time and persisted. Moreover, whether the deodorizing compounds of dokudami were volatile or non-volatile was investigated. The deodorizing activity of a volatile solution of dokudami against garlic was extremely higher than that of dokudami dry powder. Our findings revealed that the deodorizing compound of dokudami is volatile. </p...|$|R
30|$|Heteroatom-doped CDs can {{modulate}} compositions {{and structures}} of CDs {{to enhance the}} optical and electronic properties [42, 43]. In order to elucidate the effect of N element and further increase the QY of the obtained CDs, an additional N-containing chemical was <b>added</b> into <b>the</b> hydrothermal synthesis. EA is a commonly used N precursor to synthesize N doped CDs, which was chosen in this work. In detail, different volumes of EA were <b>added</b> to <b>the</b> <b>garlic</b> powder and heated at 200  °C for 6  h. As shown in Fig.  3 c, the QY firstly increased with <b>the</b> EA <b>added</b> and then dropped gradually with more EA. The highest QY could be tuned to 20.5  % with 1  mL of EA. When the ratio of EA was high, the CDs would be carbonized hardly [28] which led to lower QYs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To produce dried garlic soluble solids extract (GSSE), {{the method}} of the {{economical}} and rapid method of fining fructan extracts solution was investigated. The acidic silica sol and the bentonite as fining reagents at different concentrations were <b>added</b> into <b>the</b> <b>garlic</b> juice at soluble solids (SS) 6 %, 12 % and 15 % (W/W) and at pH 4, 5, 6, 7. The results showed that pH values affected fining firstly, and silcan sol did secondly at SS = 12 % but bentonited did secondly at SS = 15 %. When silica sol and bentonite were added at 0. 2 % and 0. 1 % (V/V), respectively, and at pH 4, the clarifying operation not only reached an acceptable yield of protein precipitate and other impurities, {{but it was also}} economically viable. It is concluded that acceptable fining parameters waries based on the GSSE and could be obtained according to the test for the producing dried GSSE as the source of fructan...|$|R
