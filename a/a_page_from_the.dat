5|$|By 1940, the {{collections}} {{at the library}} had increased to total of about 130,000 and 1,400 serials. Included in {{the collections}} were a variety of rare items, such as <b>a</b> <b>page</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1642 printing of the Polychronicon, a 1628 book of poems written in Latin, and a 1769 bible printed by John Baskerville, among others. At that time the building was open from 7:50 am until 10 pm on weekdays, and 2 pm to 5 pm on Sundays. Construction on the new wing of the library started in 1940 and was designed by John V. Bennes, the same architect who designed the original structure. He also designed a matching wing {{for the other side}} as well, but that wing was never added.|$|E
5|$|A life-size {{model of}} the light cycle was put on display at a booth at Fan Expo 2009 in Toronto, Ontario from August 28–30, 2009, along with a special {{presentation}} of material from the production. The conceptual art shown at Comic-Con was shown in the session, along with some test film of the martial artists who play a more athletic style of Disc Wars. A segment from the film showed Flynn's son entering the now-decrepit arcade, playing a Tron stand-up arcade video game, noticing a passage in {{the wall behind the}} Tron game and entering it, the passage closing behind him. Flynn's son makes the visit to the arcade after Alan Bradley receives <b>a</b> <b>page</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> disconnected phone number of the arcade. The footage was used later as part of the trailer released on March 5, 2010.|$|E

The commentary is heavily ironic, with the headline reading Ce que disent les cubes... (What the cubes say...).|$|E

25|$|The plays The Merchant of Venice and A Midsummer Night's Dream by William Shakespeare both {{influenced}} Breaking Dawn. Meyer {{decided that}} Alice would write her instruction to Bella on <b>a</b> <b>page</b> <b>from</b> <b>The</b> Merchant of Venice {{to give a}} clue that the final confrontation {{at the end of}} the book would be a mental one—not a physical battle—like the one {{at the end of the}} play. It also hints that the novel would have a happy ending for the couples, as in The Merchant of Venice. Originally it was the novel Jane Eyre by Charlotte Brontë that Alice tore a page from, but Jane Eyre had nothing to do with the story, so Meyer changed it.|$|E
25|$|President Menem {{had already}} privatized the state telecom concern and {{national}} airlines (the once-premier airline in Latin America, Aerolíneas Argentinas, which was later almost {{run into the}} ground). The stability Cavallo's plan helped bring about, however, opened prospects for more privatizations than ever. Going on to total over 200 state enterprises, these included: the costly state railroads concern, the state oil monopoly YPF, several public utilities, two government television stations, 10,000km (6000mi) of roads, steel and petrochemical firms, grain elevators, hotels, subways and even racetracks. A panoply of provincial and municipal banks were sold to financial giants abroad (sometimes over the opposition of their respective governors and mayors) and, taking <b>a</b> <b>page</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Chile pension system privatization, the mandatory National Pension System was opened to choice through the authorization of private pension schemes.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of World War I, Alexis Nour was residing in neutral Romania, active within the Viața Românească circle from his new home in Iași. Like other {{members of this group}} (and primarily its founder Stere), he campaigned in favor of rapprochement with the Central Powers, recommending a war on Russia for the recovery of Bessarabia. Nour thought further than his colleagues, speculating about an alliance of interests between Romanians and Ruthenians (Ukrainians). His essay Problema româno-ruteană. O pagină din marea restaurare a națiunilor ("The Romanian-Ruthenian Issue. <b>A</b> <b>Page</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Great Restoration of Nations"), published by Viața Românească in its October–November–December 1914 issue, inaugurated a series of such pieces, which talked about Ukraine's emancipation, the Bessarabian union, and, unusually in this context, the incorporation of Transnistria into Romania (with a new frontier on the Southern Bug).|$|E

500|$|Rowling {{insisted that}} the cast be kept British. Susie Figgis was {{appointed}} as casting director, working with both Columbus and Rowling in auditioning the lead roles of Harry, Ron and Hermione. Open casting calls were held for the main three roles, with only British children being considered. The principal auditions took place in three parts, with those auditioning having to read <b>a</b> <b>page</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> novel, then to improvise a scene of the students' arrival at Hogwarts, and finally to read several pages from the script in front of Columbus. Scenes from Columbus' script for the 1985 film Young Sherlock Holmes were also used in auditions. On 11 July 2000, Figgis left the production, complaining that Columbus did not consider any {{of the thousands of}} children they had auditioned [...] "worthy". On 8 August 2000, the virtually unknown Daniel Radcliffe and newcomers Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were selected to play Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, respectively.|$|E

500|$|Watchmen {{features}} a story within {{a story in}} the form of Tales of the Black Freighter, a fictional comic book from which scenes appear in issues three, five, eight, ten, and eleven. The fictional comic's story, [...] "Marooned", is read by a youth in New York City. Moore and Gibbons conceived a pirate comic because they reasoned that since the characters of Watchmen experience superheroes in real life, [...] "they probably wouldn't be at all interested in superhero comics." [...] Gibbons suggested a pirate theme, and Moore agreed in part because he is [...] "a big Bertolt Brecht fan": the Black Freighter alludes to the song [...] "Seeräuberjenny" [...] ("Pirate Jenny") from Brecht's Threepenny Opera. Moore theorized that since superheroes existed, and existed as [...] "objects of fear, loathing, and scorn, the main superheroes quickly fell out of popularity in comic books, as we suggest. Mainly, genres like horror, science fiction, and piracy, particularly piracy, became prominent—with EC riding the crest of the wave." [...] Moore felt [...] "the imagery of the whole pirate genre is so rich and dark that it provided a perfect counterpoint to the contemporary world of Watchmen". The writer expanded upon the premise so that its presentation in the story would add subtext and allegory. The supplemental article detailing the fictional history of Tales of the Black Freighter at the end of issue five credits real-life artist Joe Orlando as a major contributor to the series. Moore chose Orlando because he felt that if pirate stories were popular in the Watchmen universe that DC editor Julius Schwartz might have tried to lure the artist over to the company to draw a pirate comic book. Orlando contributed a drawing designed as if it were <b>a</b> <b>page</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fake title to the supplemental piece.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1950s, the Sunday strip {{included}} a frame devoted to <b>a</b> <b>page</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Crimestoppers' Textbook", a series of handy illustrated hints for the amateur crime-fighter.
