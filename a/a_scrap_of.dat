5|$|Apatodon mirus, {{based on}} <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> {{vertebra}} Marsh first {{thought to be}} a mammalian jaw, has been listed as a synonym of Allosaurus fragilis. However, it was considered indeterminate beyond Dinosauria by Dan Chure, and Mickey Mortimer believes that the synonymy of Apatodon with Allosaurus was due to correspondence to Ralph Molnar by John McIntosh, whereby the latter reportedly found a paper saying that Othniel Charles Marsh admitted that the Apatodon holotype was actually an allosaurid dorsal vertebra.|$|E
5|$|Radiocarbon dating {{determined}} that the papyrus is medieval, and further analysis of the language led most scholars to conclude it was copied from the Gospel of Thomas. The fragment's provenance and similarity to another fragment from the same anonymous owner widely believed to be fake further supported a consensus among scholars that the text is a modern forgery written on <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> medieval papyrus.|$|E
5|$|After Cage {{finished}} {{teaching at}} the New School {{in the summer of}} 1960, Ono was determined to rent a place to present her works along with the work of other avant-garde artists in the city. She eventually found a cheap loft in downtown Manhattan at 112 Chambers Street that she used as a studio and living space. Supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society, Ono allowed composer La Monte Young to organize concerts in the loft. Both began organizing a series of events there from December 1960 through June 1961, with people such as Marcel Duchamp and Peggy Guggenheim attending, and both Ono and Young claimed to have been the primary curator of these events, with Ono claiming to have been eventually pushed into a subsidiary role by Young. The Chambers Street series hosted some of Ono's earliest conceptual artwork, including Painting to Be Stepped On, which was <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> canvas on the floor that became a completed artwork upon the accrual of footprints. With that work, Ono suggested that a work of art no longer needed to be mounted on a wall and inaccessible. She showed this work and other instructional work again at Macunias's AG Gallery in July 1961.|$|E

25|$|Tolkien {{describes}} Gollum {{as either}} dark, bone-white or sallow; {{at one point}} the Men of Ithilien mistake his silhouette seen from a distance for that of a tailless black squirrel. In a manuscript written to guide illustrators to the appearance of his characters, Tolkien explained this by saying that Gollum had pale skin, but wore dark clothes and was often seen in poor light. The Hobbit states he has pockets, in which he keeps a tooth-sharpening-rock, goblin teeth, wet shells, and <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> bat wing.|$|E

25|$|The unnamed {{narrator is}} brought to trial before {{sinister}} judges of the Spanish Inquisition. Poe provides no explanation of why he is there or of the charges on which he is being tried. Before him are seven tall white candles on a table, and, as they burn down, his hopes of survival also diminish. He is condemned to death, whereupon he faints and later awakens to find himself in a totally dark room. At first the prisoner thinks that he is locked in a tomb, but then he discovers {{that he is in}} a cell. He decides to explore the cell by placing <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> his robe against the wall so that he can count the paces around the room, but he faints before he can measure the whole perimeter.|$|E
25|$|Inspector Davies and Poirot meet back at Fernley. The call to Dr. Sheppard {{has been}} traced. It {{was made from}} the local railway station, {{a few minutes before}} the late-night express train for Liverpool left. He has also found out that the woman in the lodge house saw Ralph Paton enter the grounds at 9.25pm. The {{fingerprints}} on the dagger are yet to be tested but Poirot has a theory that they will find only the dead man's prints on the handle. The missing letter from Mrs Ferrars is also a puzzle and Poirot summons Parker and asks him to state what is different about the study compared to when he helped break in the previous evening. Parker tells him of the differences – including the fact that the armchair was pulled out from its normal position and turned at a strange angle, something that catches Poirot's attention. Raymond is questioned about any strangers seen in the past week – the only one he can recall was a young representative from a firm of Dictaphone manufacturers called Curtis and Trout – Sir Roger was considering buying one of their machines. Poirot reveals that he found <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> starched material in the summerhouse and theorises that it came from the dress of Bourne who is {{the only person in the}} house who has no alibi. Mr Hammond, the family solicitor, arrives and reveals that the dead man's will leaves the majority of Sir Roger's estate to Ralph – another motive for the murder. It is also revealed that cash to the sum of one hundred pounds is missing from Sir Roger's room. Ralph though remains the principle suspect and Poirot tells the assembled group that he knows they are all individually hiding something from him and that he means to find the truth.|$|E
500|$|The bleakness of the {{painting}} is informed by the artist's harsh nihilism and existentialist view of life. Bacon was Catholic, but according to his friend and biographer Michael Peppiatt, when he found {{he could no longer}} believe he was [...] "extremely disappointed and furious, and anybody with <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> religious belief... he would go for them". [...] Peppiatt makes the observation of Bacon that [...] "if somebody has that intensity, its almost a faith in and of itself".|$|E

They share [...] ("a tawny twig of Turkish tobacco") with their neighbor, and the three discuss political personalities drawn directly from recent history, including William Pitt the Elder and the Voltigeurs. Still, realist detail is not commonly in the foreground of commentary about Z. Marcas. As Hunt explains, it is mostly remembered [...] "as a vehicle for a characteristic Balzacian whimsy".|$|E
500|$|In {{the series}} finale [...] "The Truth", Skinner seeks Covarrubias {{as a witness}} in Mulder's trial for murder. After Skinner fails to track her down, the ghost of X hands Mulder <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> paper with her new address on it. She is called upon to testify, and speaks about her {{involvement}} with the Syndicate to some extent. However, when pressed for further information about {{the continuation of the}} conspiracy she clams up, and at Mulder's request is dismissed from the stand for fear that if she divulges certain knowledge, she would be killed.|$|E

The agents collaborate with Glen Chao, a Chinese-American detective with the SFPD. When they find a Chinese character written inside the oven, Chao translates it as meaning [...] "ghost." [...] Mulder also finds <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> burned paper in the ashes, which Chao identifies as [...] "hell money", a symbolic offering to deceased spirits.

500|$|In 1900, Ina Coolbrith, Bohemian Club librarian, edited a {{collection}} of O'Connell's poetry, entitled Songs from Bohemia, copyrighted to Mabel Ashley O'Connell. Coolbrith ended the book with [...] "The Chamber of Sleep", the last poem by O'Connell, written ten days before his death. William Greer Harrison wrote in a memorial foreword that O'Connell was an avid outdoorsman of eternally sunny disposition. He mentioned his appreciation for good food and his fine chef's skill in delicate cookery. Harrison wrote of his flair for swordsmanship and his pleasure in fishing, and noted that during any of these activities, O'Connell could be seen pausing to write down on <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> paper {{an idea for a}} story.|$|E
500|$|Pei took to {{the project}} with vigor, and set to work with two young architects he had {{recently}} recruited to the firm, William Pedersen and Yann Weymouth. Their first obstacle was the unusual shape of the building site, a trapezoid of land {{at the intersection of}} Constitution and Pennsylvania Avenues. Inspiration struck Pei in 1968, when he scrawled a rough diagram of two triangles on <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> paper. The larger building would be the public gallery; the smaller would house offices and archives. This triangular shape became a singular vision for the architect. As the date for groundbreaking approached, Pedersen suggested to his boss that a slightly different approach would make construction easier. Pei simply smiled and said: [...] "No compromises." ...|$|E

2500|$|Svenska Vecko Nyheter (Swedish Weekly News) (February 1937) — Pilot {{issue of}} a 12-page Swedish-American {{communist}} weekly, which included 2 pages in English.

One Jackson fan recalled being {{selected from the}} audience to meet with Jackie. Backstage, she was handed <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> paper with {{an address to the}} location in which they were to meet. Michael approached her from behind and warned her that his brothers did not treat women right and that his brother only wanted to use her for sex. Changing the subject, the female fan asked for the pop star's autograph, which request he obliged in addition to writing, [...] "Please, don't go". The woman ignored Michael's request and headed to the Jacksons' apartment complex, where she had sex with Jackie. Afterward, Jackie informed the woman that they would not meet again. Ashamed and upset, the fan left the apartment in tears.|$|E
500|$|The {{invention}} {{that brought}} Lawrence to international fame {{started out as}} a sketch on <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> a paper napkin. While sitting in the library one evening in 1929, Lawrence glanced over a journal article by Rolf Widerøe, and was intrigued by one of the diagrams. This depicted a device that produced high-energy particles by means of a succession of small [...] "pushes". The device depicted was laid out in a straight line using increasingly longer electrodes. At the time, physicists were beginning to explore the atomic nucleus. In 1919, the New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford had fired alpha particles into nitrogen and had succeeded in knocking protons out of some of the nuclei. But nuclei have a positive charge that repels other positively charged nuclei, and they are bound together tightly by a force that physicists were only just beginning to understand. To break them up, to disintegrate them, would require much higher energies, of the order of millions of volts.|$|E
500|$|In 1939, Stalin {{approved}} {{the publication of}} one volume of poetry, From Six Books; however, the collection was withdrawn and pulped {{after only a few}} months. In 1993, it was revealed that the authorities had bugged her flat and kept her under constant surveillance, keeping detailed files on her from this time, accruing some 900 pages of [...] "denunciations, reports of phone taps, quotations from writings, confessions of those close to her". Although officially stifled, Akhmatova's work continued to circulate in secret. Akhmatova's close friend, chronicler Lydia Chukovskaya described how writers working to keep poetic messages alive used various strategies. A small trusted circle would, for example, memorise each other's works and circulate them only by oral means. She tells how Akhmatova would write out her poem for a visitor on <b>a</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>of</b> paper to be read in a moment, then burnt in her stove. The poems were carefully disseminated in this way, however it is likely that many compiled in this manner were lost. [...] "It was like a ritual," [...] Chukovskaya wrote.
