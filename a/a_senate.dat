50|$|Support for {{bicameralism}} is {{not completely}} absent, however, {{and there have been}} occasional proposals for a new upper house or <b>Senate.</b> <b>A</b> constitutional reform committee chaired by Ronald Algie proposed <b>an</b> appointed <b>Senate</b> in 1952. In 1990, the government of Jim Bolger proposed <b>an</b> elected <b>Senate,</b> <b>an</b> idea advanced partly as an alternative to New Zealand's electoral reform process.|$|R

5|$|Gillard sought Labor Party {{preselection}} {{twice for}} {{seats in the}} House of Representatives during the early 1990s; however, she {{did not succeed in}} either attempt. In 1995, Gillard took a leave of absence from Slater & Gordon to contest the 1996 federal election. Gillard stood as <b>a</b> <b>Senate</b> candidate, having been preselected for the third position on Labor's ticket, although she was not elected to the position.|$|E
5|$|Jennings, {{seeking to}} advance his {{political}} career, {{ran for the}} Senate twice, but was defeated in both attempts. In 1825 he was <b>a</b> <b>senate</b> candidate {{at a time when}} the Indiana General Assembly elected the state's senators to Congress.

50|$|When Whitlam {{responded by}} {{immediately}} calling an election {{for both the}} House and <b>Senate</b> (<b>a</b> double dissolution), McManus informed the Victorian Central Executive that Billy Snedden had agreed to the Liberals running <b>a</b> joint <b>Senate</b> ticket with the DLP, which would have guaranteed him <b>a</b> winnable <b>Senate</b> spot.

This amendment passed the full Senate in the spring of 2008. He sponsored the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran's oil and gas industry, which has not passed committee; and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism. Obama also sponsored <b>a</b> <b>Senate</b> amendment to the State Children's Health Insurance Program, providing one year of job protection for family members caring for soldiers with combat-related injuries.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} bill first passed the Commons, Baird {{acknowledged}} that the Conservatives might have unintentionally broken political financing laws by failing to report convention fees collected in 2005. He told <b>a</b> <b>Senate</b> committee that $1.7 million was left unreported {{and that he did}} not realize it was an issue at the time. The matter is under review by the Chief Electoral Officer. The Conservatives quietly tabled an amendment to the Accountability Act in November 2006, stipulating that convention fees will not be counted as political contributions.|$|E
5|$|That there {{potentially}} {{would be}} a lack of continuity between political platforms from a governor of one party and <b>a</b> <b>senate</b> president of another who assumes the post as acting governor. As there was no guarantee the two individuals would be {{members of the same}} party, there was greater concern that the policies of the acting governor might be in direct conflict with those of the preceding governor.|$|E

2500|$|<b>As</b> <b>Senate</b> {{elections}} approached further opposition splits occurred. Ncube's supporters {{argued that}} the M.D.C. should field a slate of candidates; Tsvangirai's argued for a boycott. When party leaders voted on the issue, Ncube's side narrowly won, but Mr. Tsvangirai declared that {{as president of the}} party he was not bound by the majority's decision. Again the opposition was weakened. As a result, the elections for <b>a</b> new <b>Senate</b> in November 2005 were largely boycotted by the opposition. Mugabe's party won 24 of the 31 constituencies where elections were held amid low voter turnout. Again, evidence surfaced of voter intimidation and fraud.|$|R
5|$|The Ineligibility Clause has {{interfered}} with appointments {{as far back}} as 1793. President George Washington attempted to appoint William Paterson to the Supreme Court on February 27, 1793, after the resignation of Associate Justice Thomas Johnson. However, Paterson, who was serving as Governor of New Jersey, had previously been elected to serve <b>a</b> <b>Senate</b> term that would expire at noon on March 4, 1793. Washington withdrew the nomination and withheld it until the afternoon of March 4, when the term for the disqualifying office had expired.|$|E
5|$|The Interior Department {{announced}} in July 1921 that Edward Doheny had been awarded a lease to drill {{along the edges}} of naval reserve Elk Hills in California. The announcement attracted little controversy, as the oil would have been lost to wells on adjacent private land. Wyoming Senator John Kendrick had heard from constituents that Teapot Dome had also been leased, but no announcement had been made. The Interior Department refused to provide documentation, so he secured the passage of <b>a</b> <b>Senate</b> resolution compelling disclosure. The department sent a copy of the lease granting drilling rights to Harry Sinclair's Mammoth Oil Company, along with a statement that there had been no competitive bidding because military preparedness was involved—Mammoth was to build oil tanks for the Navy as part of the deal. This satisfied some people, but some conservationists, such as Gifford Pinchot, Harry A. Slattery, and others, pushed for a full investigation into Fall and his activities. They got Wisconsin Senator Robert M. La Follette Sr. to begin <b>a</b> <b>Senate</b> investigation into the oil leases. La Follette persuaded Democratic Montana Senator Thomas J. Walsh to lead the investigation, and Walsh read through the truckload of material provided by the Interior Department through 1922 into 1923, including a letter from Harding stating that the transfer and leases had been with his knowledge and approval.|$|E
