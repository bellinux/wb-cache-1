The five-member Commission consisted of presidents of Constitutional Courts in the EEC. Starting in late November 1991, the committee rendered ten opinions.

Further disputed areas are located near the town of Bačka Palanka, and in the municipality of Sombor, at the tripoint of Croatia, Hungary and Serbia. Croatia claims that the cadastre-based boundary was adopted by the Đilas Commission, set up in 1945 to determine the borders between federal constituents of Yugoslavia, while Serbia claims that the same commission identified the boundary as the course of the Danube in 1945. In 1991, the <b>Arbitration</b> <b>Commission</b> of the Peace Conference on Yugoslavia ruled that the border between federal units of Yugoslavia became inviolable international borders, without referring to locations of any specific claim or line. The opinion was rendered at the request of Serbia. Prior to the ruling, Serbia asserted that the borders were subject to change following the breakup of Yugoslavia and the independence of Croatia. Since the Croatian War of Independence, the line of control coincides with the Serbian claim.|$|E

Samaras scored on the opening day of the season, on 20 August, when he helped Heerenveen to a 5–4 victory over Roda JC. He picked up a minor leg injury in September, which ruled him out of Heerenveen's UEFA Cup tie against Baník Ostrava. But he returned to action on 23 September, and scored as Heerenveen beat NEC Nijmegen 2–1. On 14 December, Samaras scored as Heerenveen came back from behind to beat Levski Sofia 2–1 in the UEFA Cup. On 30 December, Samaras scored twice as Heerenveen beat Ajax 4–2. In January 2006, Arsenal and Manchester City showed interest in signing the striker. Samaras tried to get released from his contract after Heerenveen had rejected a bid from Manchester City.

40|$|The National Land Act of 1964, {{designed}} to unify legislation concerning land, formally abolished the various local systems of land law in Senegal. The {{implementation of the}} various urban land regulations and the efforts to restructure and regulate the spontaneous settlements which were started in Ziguinchor, {{the capital of the}} Casamance, in the 1970 s resulted in a great number of urban land conflicts. This paper reviews Senegalese law relating to urban land. It explores the handling by the formal judicial and administrative institutions of urban land disputes and the conceptions and attitudes of the urbanites involved in these conflicts. The deliberate and systematic ignoring in the new national land law of the actual urban situation (more or less characterized by the persistence of - accommodated - traditional customs and values) seems to have contributed to the problems in the implementation of formal land law in Ziguinchor. The basic material for this paper has been drawn from court records and the minutes of special administrative <b>arbitration</b> <b>commissions</b> for review of land disputes. A main problem appears to be that land disputes submitted to court are handled by the criminal judge, although the 'defendants' do not feel in the least criminal. Besides, the material shows a difference between the general and formalistic decisions of the judge, and the more concrete solutions of the <b>arbitration</b> <b>commissions</b> that were set up to process the great number of urban land disputes.

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the principle of}} legal independence of state enterprises {{on the grounds of}} regulations implementing the economic reform. The authoress made an attempt at ascertaining whether these legal provisions create grounds to formulate the principle of independence as the principle in directional meaning.

Numerous specific directions of activities can be derived — in the authoress opinion — from that general direction, they would be designed for the organs of state administration, (including the founding organ), the legislator, courts of justice, <b>arbitration</b> <b>commissions</b> and for the very enterprise.

5000|$|The Arbitration Law {{provides}} that <b>arbitration</b> and <b>arbitration</b> <b>commissions</b> should be independent and free from interference by administration organs, public organizations, or individuals. While the government played an instrumental {{role in the}} founding and initial organization of the BAC, and the BMG appoints BAC personnel, the organization is effectively independent. Today, the appointment of personnel by the BMG functions as a formality. First, the stringent qualifications required for personnel {{set out in the}} Arbitration Law limits the BMG's discretion in appointing personnel. Only specified departments and organizations may recommend candidates and the BMG never vetoes the recommendations. Second, the Chairman or the Vice-Chairman by designation may hold meetings of the Commission only if two-thirds of the Members are present. Any revisions of the BAC Constitution or dissolution of the BAC require the approval of {{more than two-thirds of the}} Commission Members. Other resolutions require the approval of more than two-thirds of the Commission Members present at the meeting. The decision-making process minimizes the ability of a government-appointed Commission Members from compromising the Commission's independence. Third, the BAC achieved financial independence from the government in 1998 and currently operates as a public institution [...] "managed as an enterprise." [...] Within the first three years after its creation, the BAC's caseload increased dramatically, providing the BAC with a stable source of funding from arbitration fees. The BAC has been self-funded since 2002. Fourth, the BMG has taken a [...] "hands-off approach" [...] in its strong support of the BAC. The BMG's involvement is limited to providing the BAC with necessary financial assistance, allowing the BAC to operate independently.|$|R

However, such an intervention may not always be possible in a society devoid of a Mahatma, nonetheless peace can be brought about by establishing a truth commission. According to the author, basic procedural justice makes possible a minimally decent life, which has a value independent of any wider conception of the good. In order to transform a barbaric society into a decent society, it is important to transit through certain stages. First, a highly frail and temporary truce prevails that may easily collapse generating a fresh burst of violence. With the help from appropriate institutions, such as the truth commissions, we move to stage two, to a minimally decent society. A sufficiently prolonged period of minimal decency may eventually create facilitating conditions for stage three, for forgiveness and reconciliation, and therefore, to a fully decent society. In order to break the cycle of revenge, former victims must be inducted into a system of basic procedural justice equipped with a mechanism of <b>arbitration,</b> Truth <b>commission</b> can help in the recovery of the submerged voice of the victim.

Now the states have to get along with each other, and hence they cartelize more and more issues of their politics in international institutions. Like in enterprise cartels the members' assembly is always the main institution of the combinations: the respective council of ministers or delegates, e.g., the Council of the European Union.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the {{judicial}} review of arbitral awards in China. Chinese arbitration law provides a distinct set of rules for reviewing international and domestic awards, which is usually {{referred to as the}} dual-track system (“Shuang Gui Zhi”). First, the judicial review standard is dual-track because international awards are subject to procedural and limited review, whereas domestic awards are subject to substantial review. Second, the review procedure is also dual-track because a reporting mechanism under which the lower courts cannot deny an international award without confirmation by the Supreme People’s Court of China is applied to international awards but is not applied to domestic awards. The following question arises: Should the dual-track judicial review system for arbitral awards be harmonised into a single system, and if so, how should it be accomplished. This question has sparked heated debates among scholars and practitioners. It is important because appropriate and efficient judicial review of awards is essential to the functioning and development of the arbitration system in China. The research is based on the theory of path-dependent and institutional change. My consideration of the future of the dual-track system is centred on the wisdom of the original policy considerations behind the dual-track judicial review path, the solidity of the institutional foundations of the dual-track judicial review path and feedback on the dual-track system from judicial practice and the arbitration market. The research critically examined the policies and institutions behind the design of the dual-track judicial review and conducted an empirical study of the feedback of the design, which included a comprehensive review of various materials, cases and data relating to the subject. The thesis concluded that the dual-track review path should be reformed by harmonising the dual-track review standard while maintaining and revising the dual-track procedure. The dual-track review standard should be uniform, and the limited scope of procedural review should be applied to both domestic and international awards. Policy and institutional foundations have failed in the substantial review of domestic awards due to the disruption in boundaries between international business and Chinese domestic business, as well as a weakened distinction between international and domestic <b>arbitration</b> <b>commissions.</b> The case study and the survey provide further empirical evidence that supports my argument, which revealed that the dual-track standard causes chaos and abuse of law in judicial practice and has gained negative feedback from arbitration market participants. In contrast, the dual-track judicial review procedure should be maintained and revised. The study indicated that the reporting mechanism still acts as a positive force to control the outcome of reviews and secure proper and uniform application of the law. Despite its shortcomings, it still {{plays an important role in}} counteracting the negative effect of local protectionism and reinforces confidence of foreign investors in arbitration and within the legal infrastructure in China. Based on the above findings, the author proposed a new regulatory framework designed to be sufficiently flexible and current for meeting the practical requirements of arbitration, while considering suitable interaction between arbitration bodies and courts. Specifically, the thesis suggested that the Arbitration Law should be revised as a unitary and exclusive legal framework for regulating judicial review of arbitral awards, and for incorporating the rules of enforcement of arbitral awards specified in the Civil Procedural Law. Although separate regimes for domestic and international arbitration should be maintained, the criteria for differentiating various types of arbitral awards should be clarified and redefined. Finally, the thesis made several concrete suggestions for improving specific provisions of the law that govern judicial review of arbitral awards. published_or_final_versionLawDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

In 1866, the Colony of Vancouver Island was merged with the Colony of British Columbia to form an enlarged Colony of British Columbia. In 1871, the enlarged colony joined the newly formed Dominion of Canada. That year, the United Kingdom and the United States signed the Treaty of Washington, which dealt with various differences between the two nations, including border issues involving the newly formed Dominion. Among the results of the treaty was the decision to resolve the San Juan dispute by international arbitration, with King Wilhelm I of Germany chosen to act as arbitrator. Wilhelm referred the issue to a three-man <b>arbitration</b> <b>commission</b> which met in Geneva for nearly a year. On October 21, 1872, the commission decided in favor of the United States.

On 20 February 1953, the arbitrator granted Albania's claim. This did not end the issue: Italy asserted claims to the gold that were not covered by Part III of the Final Act. These additional claims gave rise to a new ICJ case, Monetary Gold Removed from Rome in 1943, which Italy commenced on 9 May 1953. This case was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds on 15 June 1954, and the gold remained in a vault in London under the Tripartite Commission's name.|$|R
5000|$|The {{petroleum}} workers {{struggle was}} well regarded by the President {{and the population}} despite problems caused by the petroleum shortage. Due to these problems, the union accepted a lift of the strike on June 9, after the president urged them present their case before the General Arbitration and Conciliation Board (Junta General de Conciliacion y Arbitraje). In July, as instructed by the <b>arbitration</b> board, a <b>commission</b> of financial experts was formed that investigated the petroleum companies finances, concluding that their profits easily permitted them to cover {{the demands of the}} workers. The report stated that just one company (El Aguila) had received annual profits of over 55 million pesos. The arbirtration board concluded that the oil companies should pay 26 million pesos for wages and benefits to the workers. The companies, however, insisted the demands would cripple production and bankrupt them, and refused to pay. The president once again intervened to mediate between the parties, and met with oil company representatives at the national palace on September 2. In this meeting, one of El Aguila representatives took issue with the description of it being a foreign company, and stated that El Aguila was a Mexican company. In response, Jesus Silva Herzog (present in the meeting) responded with a financial newspaper from London that cited a report from the Royal Dutch Shell of 1928: [...] "Our Mexican subsidiary, Oil Company El Aguila, has obtained good returns during the last fiscal cycle." [...] It was also explained that El Aguila de Mexico would set the price of an oil barrel at 1.96 when sold to The Eagle Shipping company. This price was below the market value of 3.19 USD per barrel. This way profits would be hidden to the Mexican treasury, and taxes were saved.|$|R
40|$|International {{investment}} arbitration is {{a preferred}} method for resolving investor-state disputes relating to alleged breaches of investment protection, forming part of substantive protection for cross-border investments within the {{vast network of}} international investment agreements. Since the birth of international investment arbitration in the 1960 s, this institution has gone through notable developments, of which the presence of EU law and the European Commission as an intervening third party {{are some of the}} most recent changes. The role of the European Commission as a third party within the international arbitration regime has not, in this specific sense, been subject to academic research. It is therefore of interest and importance to research the role of the European Commission as a modern third party intervener in international investment arbitration. This thesis examines the case law of investment arbitration tribunals, most prominently the International Centre for Dispute Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), in which third party interventions have taken place. Amicus curiae or third party intervention is a procedural right for interested third parties to intervene within investment arbitration, expressing their opinions relating to the dispute. The amicus curiae institution helps the arbitral tribunal in its most inherent task, which is to find the right decision in the dispute at hand, by enlightening the tribunal with information that would in the absence of such third party submissions be left outside its knowledge. As the international investment arbitration has gained more presence within the international judicial landscape it has also been put under the scrutiny of the public society. Through this public exposure the investment arbitration regime has been proven to lack important features of legitimacy and transparency and many initiatives have recently been taken in order to remedy these flaws. The investment arbitration regime has come to a modern era and simultaneously the amicus curiae institution has developed significantly. Through the codification of desires of various stakeholders and the practice of investment arbitration tribunals, there are today sufficient rules in order to establish the prerequisites for the acceptance of amicus curiae. Today, amicus curiae intervention is supported with the arguments that it enhances the transparency and legitimacy of international investment <b>arbitration.</b> The European <b>Commission</b> has been actively participating as a third party intervener in investment arbitration since the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty in 2009, when investment law was incorporated into the exclusive competence of the European Commission. This thesis examines the situations where the European Commission has intervened, and comes to the finding that the role of the European Commission is incompatible with the modern amicus curiae institution. Notwithstanding these findings, I argue in this thesis that the role and the ample rights granted to the European Commission can be legitimized with support from the original meaning of amicus curiae, as its participation can also contribute to enhanced legitimacy of the international investment arbitration regime...|$|R
