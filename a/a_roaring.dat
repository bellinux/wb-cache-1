5|$|Since many tornadoes are audible {{only when}} very near, sound {{is not to}} be thought of as a {{reliable}} warning signal for a tornado. Tornadoes are also not the only source of such sounds in severe thunderstorms; any strong, damaging wind, a severe hail volley, or continuous thunder in a thunderstorm may produce <b>a</b> <b>roaring</b> sound.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though their}} most recent single was doing poorly, Deep Purple {{maintained}} {{a reputation as a}} fine live act in the US. The band had now begun to develop their stage presence into something grander, going in a louder and heavier direction and focusing more and more on the instrumental interplay between Blackmore and Lord. In particular the latter had found a way to short-circuit the original Leslie speakers of his Hammond organ C-3 and connect the instrument directly into the stacks of Marshall amps, obtaining <b>a</b> <b>roaring</b> sound and matching the guitar in loudness.|$|E
5|$|Early {{experiments}} with floating petroleum {{on the sea}} and igniting it were not entirely successful: the fuel was difficult to ignite, large quantities were required to cover even modest areas and the weapon was easily disrupted by waves. However, the potential was clear. By early 1941 a flame barrage technique was developed. Rather than attempting to ignite oil floating on water, nozzles were placed above high-water mark with pumps producing sufficient pressure to spray fuel which produced <b>a</b> <b>roaring</b> wall of flame over, rather than on, the water. Such installations consumed considerable resources and although this weapon was impressive, its network of pipes was vulnerable to pre-landing bombardment; General Brooke did not consider it effective. Initially ambitious plans were cut back to cover {{just a few miles}} of beaches.|$|E

5|$|After a {{long night}} of drinking, Homer and Grampa awaken and {{discover}} that they bought the pub from Tom O'Flanagan during the previous night's binge, much to their shock and dismay. They rename the bar and try to continue running it but get no business and {{have to find a}} way to market their unwelcoming business. Homer gets help from Moe Szyslak, who suggests that they allow people to do illegal things in their pub. They find out that smoking is now banned from Irish pubs and Moe urges the Simpsons to turn it into a smokeasy. They do <b>a</b> <b>roaring</b> trade, but are closed down by the Irish authorities. As a punishment, Homer and Grampa are deported back to America and have to pay a small fine. Chief Wiggum arrives to bring them back to the U.S., but accidentally hits himself with his nightstick and then Maces and Tasers himself.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Katy and her boyfriend (played by actor and model Brian Nagel) have crashed their plane {{in the middle of the}} jungle. Katy shows signs of worry, while her boyfriend takes pictures of himself and dumps his bags on her to explore. As it turns to night, they wander through the jungle as he throws things back at her. Suddenly, he is attacked by a tiger and Katy dumps her bags and runs off screaming. She approaches a lake and is almost bitten by a crocodile when she tries to take a drink. She sits on a rock and ends up with a tarantula crawling on her. As she looks into the lake while singing the chorus, she sees a reflection of a tiger instead of herself. Behind her in the darkness there are dozens of pairs of blinking eyes, but they are revealed to be fireflies which fly around her before forming an image of <b>a</b> <b>roaring</b> tiger in the sky.|$|E
5|$|United's woes {{continued}} {{in their final}} match of April, where they traveled south to take on Houston Dynamo on 29 April. United was routed 4–1 in the match, making them have a league-worst 16 goals conceded. However, with 10 goals scored, United was jointly tied for second in the league for goals scored on. The Orange Crush came out on <b>a</b> <b>roaring</b> start, as Dynamo-striker Will Bruin netted in the fourth minute of play. In the 39th minute, United defender Marc Burch scored off a complex free kick that caused the Dynamo defense to scramble, tallying his first goal of 2011. The parity was short-lived, as Bruin would regain the lead for Houston two minutes later off of a header from Brad Davis cross. Bruin would complete his hat trick in the 57th minute to give Dynamo a commanding 3–1 lead. Houston's Cam Weaver came in to add a buffer to {{the lead in the}} 62nd minute.|$|E

25|$|On 11 March 1944, Petiot's {{neighbors in}} Rue Le Sueur complained to police about a foul stench {{in the area}} and large amounts of smoke {{billowing}} from a chimney of the house. Fearing a chimney fire, the police summoned firemen, who entered the house and found <b>a</b> <b>roaring</b> fire in a coal stove in the basement. In the fire, and scattered in the basement, were human remains.|$|E
25|$|One notable {{change in}} the film {{involved}} the opening titles. Concerned that <b>a</b> <b>roaring</b> Leo the Lion (the MGM mascot) would create the wrong mood for the sensitive and sacred nativity scene, Wyler received permission to replace the traditional logo with one in which Leo the Lion is quiet. It {{was the first time}} in MGM history that the lion logo was not seen roaring.|$|E

According to the logo designers, since lion is the king of the jungle, the roaring lion logo reflects the team name. The details of the logo signifies various qualities such as youth, vibrancy, solid performance orientation and fiery spirit.|$|E

25|$|The initial main {{titles of}} the series {{featured}} the image of <b>a</b> <b>roaring</b> fireplace, a visual representation of the originally proposed title — Between Heaven and Hell — ultimately changed to One Life to Live to avoid controversy. One Life to Lives first sponsor was the Colgate-Palmolive company, who also sponsored The Doctors. ABC bought the show from Nixon in December 1974 when they purchased all stock to her Creative Horizons, Inc. The show was originally a half-hour serial until it was expanded to 45 minutes on July 23, 1976, and to one hour on January 16, 1978.|$|E
25|$|Bogan {{was placed}} in the back room of a local saloon, as there was no jail at the time, but before his shotgun wound had healed, the next day in fact, he took {{advantage}} of the poor security and made an escape during <b>a</b> <b>roaring</b> blizzard. Owens, knowing that Bogan was badly wounded, believed he could not go far. He was right, as two weeks later Bogan, burning up with fever and with his wound infected, sent word to Owens that he wished to surrender and receive medical attention. Bogan met with Owens sixteen miles outside of Lusk, and voiced to Owens that he feared a lynch mob would be waiting for him when they reached Lusk, as Gunn was extremely well liked and respected in the town. As they entered town, Owens backed down a mob that was intent on hanging Bogan, then Owens shackled Bogan {{in the back of the}} Sweeney Saloon. The next day, Owens left with Bogan en route to Cheyenne, Wyoming, and by February 4 he had him secured in the Laramie County jail.|$|E
25|$|Sheriff Masterson got {{his term}} off to <b>a</b> <b>roaring</b> start on February 1, 1878, by {{capturing}} Dave Rudabaugh and Ed West, who were wanted for an attempted train robbery. Two {{more of the}} train robbers were caught by Bat and brother Ed on March 15, but the tandem law-enforcement effort {{came to an abrupt}} end when 25-year-old City Marshal Edward J. Masterson was shot and killed {{in the line of duty}} on April 9, 1878. Ed was shot by a cowboy named Jack Wagner, who was unaware that Ed Masterson's brother Bat was in the vicinity. As mortally wounded Ed stumbled away from the scene, Bat Masterson responded from across the street with deadly force, firing on both Wagner and Wagner's boss Alf Walker, who was holding a gun. Wagner died the next day, but Walker was taken back to Texas and recovered. The local newspapers were ambiguous about who shot Wagner and Walker, and this led some later historians to question whether Bat Masterson was involved. However, the rediscovery of two court cases in which Bat Masterson testified under oath that he had shot both men adds credence to the idea that Bat avenged his brother. More violence followed on October 4, 1878, when a variety actress named Dora Hand, known professionally as Fannie Keenan, was shot and killed by James Kenedy, son of the wealthy Texas cattleman Miflin Kenedy (1818–1895). Sheriff Masterson's posse, which included Wyatt Earp and Bill Tilghman, captured Kenedy the following day after Bat used his rifle to shoot him in the left arm, and other posse members killed his horse.|$|E
60|$|The next blow blinded {{the right}} side and called forth <b>a</b> <b>roar,</b> this time of pain.
