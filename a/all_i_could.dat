25|$|You have no {{idea what}} sending on those checks to me at this time. After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all my heart and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E
25|$|Now {{differences}} between the contemporary squid and octopus samples became very clear. In the octopus, broad bands of fibers passed across {{the plane of the}} tissue and were separated by equally broad bands arranged in a perpendicular direction. In the squid there were narrower but also relatively broad bundles arranged in the plane of the section, separated by thin partitions of perpendicular fibers. It seemed I had found a means to identify the mystery sample after <b>all.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> distinguish between octopus and squid, and between them and mammals, which display a lacy network of connective tissue fibers. After 75 years, the moment of truth was at hand. Viewing section after section of the St. Augustine samples, we decided at once, and beyond any doubt, that the sample was not whale blubber. Further, the connective tissue pattern was that of broad bands in the plane of the section with equally broad bands arranged perpendicularly, a structure similar to, if not identical with, that in my octopus sample. The evidence appears unmistakable that the St. Augustine sea monster was in fact an octopus, but the implications are fantastic. Even though the sea presents us from time to time with strange and astonishing phenomena, the idea of a gigantic octopus, with arms 75 to 100 feet in length and about 18 inches in diameter at the base—a total spread of some 200 feet—is difficult to comprehend.|$|E

However, before walking out onto the pitch Johanneson {{suffered}} racial abuse: “When we walked out, <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hear was a cacophony of Zulu-like noises coming from the terraces. It was dreadful, I could barely hear myself think for those screams. I wanted to run back down the tunnel." ...|$|E

500|$|Gielgud {{was in the}} Oxford {{company in}} January and February 1924, from October 1924 {{to the end of}} January 1925, and in August 1925. He played a wide range of parts in {{classics}} and modern plays, greatly increasing his technical abilities in the process. The role he most enjoyed was Trofimov in The Cherry Orchard, his first experience of Chekhov: [...] "It was the first time I ever went out on stage feeling that perhaps, after <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> really be an actor." ...|$|E

500|$|By 1900 Olga, age 18, {{was being}} escorted to the theatre and opera by a distant cousin, Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg, {{a member of}} the Russian branch of the House of Oldenburg. He was 14 years her senior and known for his passion for {{literature}} and gambling. Peter asked for Olga's hand in marriage the following year, a proposal that took the Grand Duchess completely by surprise: [...] "I was so taken aback that <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> say was 'thank you'," [...] she later explained.|$|E
500|$|When J.

500|$|Rovelstad {{used the}} profits from the half dollar to {{continue}} work on his statuary group. [...] He sought direct funding {{from the federal government}} in 1938 and from the Illinois Legislature the following year; both attempts failed. [...] Through the half century that followed, he progressed on the statues, and by {{the time of his death}} in 1990, he had completed the group in plaster of Paris, that still needed to be bronzed before display. Shortly before his death, he told his wife, [...] "I've lived a full life and have no regrets. The Pioneer Memorial is now completed. I've done <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> Now it's up to others to see it erected. I can do no more." [...] Rovelstad's tenant, Steve Youngren, established a foundation to raise money to complete the project. [...] It raised $456,000, exceeding the actual cost by nearly ten percent, and the memorial was completed and dedicated in 2001.|$|E
500|$|Although he {{occasionally}} downplayed his own contribution to literature, Creangă himself {{was aware that}} his texts went beyond records of popular tradition, and made significant efforts {{to be recognized as}} an original author (by corresponding with fellow writers and willingly submitting his books to critical scrutiny). Vianu commented at length on the exact relationship between the narrative borrowed from oral tradition and Creangă's [...] "somewhat surreptitious" [...] method of blending his own style into the folkloric standard, likening it to the historical process whereby local painters improvised over the strict canons of Byzantine art. Creangă's complex take on individuality and the art of writing was attested by the his own foreword to an edition of his collected stories, in which he addressed the reader directly: [...] "You may have read many stupid things since you were put on this Earth. Please read these as well, and where it should be that they don't agree with you, take hold of a pen and come up with something better, for this is <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see myself doing and did." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{alternative}} studio {{version of}} [...] "What Is Life" [...] – in fact, a rough {{mix of the}} original backing track with different orchestration (in this case, piccolo trumpet and oboe) – was issued as one of five bonus tracks on the 2001 remaster of All Things Must Pass. In the accompanying booklet, Harrison writes that this orchestral arrangement was discarded because he [...] "didn't like the feel". Speaking to Billboard editor-in-chief Timothy White in December 2000, Harrison explained {{the reason for the}} lack of a guide vocal on this version: [...] "I'm playing the fuzz guitar part that goes all through the song. So <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do on the [...] take was to give the band the cue line – the first line of each verse – and then go back to playing that riff. So that rough mix without the vocal – I'd forgot all about it …" [...] The track also appears on the 2014 Apple Years 1968–75 reissue of All Things Must Pass.|$|E

500|$|On September 22, Dylan {{appeared}} for {{the first}} time at Carnegie Hall, part of an all-star hootenanny. On this occasion, he premiered his new composition [...] "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall", a complex and powerful song built upon the question and answer refrain pattern of the traditional British ballad [...] "Lord Randall". [...] "Hard Rain" [...] would gain added resonance one month later, when President Kennedy appeared on national television on October 22, and announced the discovery of Soviet missiles on the island of Cuba, initiating the Cuban Missile Crisis. In the sleeve notes on the Freewheelin album, Nat Hentoff quotes Dylan as saying that he wrote [...] "Hard Rain" [...] in response to the Cuban Missile Crisis: [...] "Every line in it is actually the start of a whole new song. But when I wrote it, I thought I wouldn't have enough time alive to write all those songs so I put <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> into this one". In fact, Dylan had written the song more than a month before the crisis broke.|$|E
500|$|Whitlam {{trained as}} a {{navigator}} and bomb aimer, before serving with No. 13 Squadron RAAF, based mainly on the Gove Peninsula, Northern Territory, flying Lockheed Ventura bombers. He reached the rank of Flight Lieutenant. While in the service, he began his political activities, distributing literature for the Australian Labor Party during the 1943 federal election and urging {{the passage of the}} [...] "Fourteen Powers" [...] referendum of 1944, which would have expanded the powers of the federal government. [...] Although the party was victorious, the referendum it advocated was defeated. In 1961, Whitlam said of the referendum defeat, [...] "My hopes were dashed by the outcome and from that moment I determined to do <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to modernise the Australian Constitution." [...] While still in uniform, Whitlam joined the ALP in Sydney in 1945. He was discharged from the RAAF on 17 October 1945, and continued to use Air Force log books to record all of the flights he took until 2007. Whitlam completed his studies after the war, obtained his Bachelor of Laws, and was admitted to the federal and New South Wales bars in 1947.|$|E
500|$|When {{beginning}} {{work on her}} then-untitled third studio album, Stefani sought {{inspiration from}} her personal life in order to write lyrics for new material. She noted:... I was also in a really desperate place doing This Is What The Truth Feels Like, and I wasn’t back {{to a place of}} naiveté and purity. It was, 'All I have left right now is my music. And if I do that, maybe I’ll survive.' So, the way Tragic Kingdom was pure, this new record was pure. I was making this record because it’s <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to save my own life. She described this as a magical process. Immediately following the completion of [...] "Make Me Like You", Stefani wrote [...] "Misery" [...] with Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Mattias Larsson, and Robin Frediksson; however, unlike the recording sessions for her previous albums, the songwriting process was significantly shorter, which she opined was because everything should be simple. [...] "Misery" [...] was recorded by Mattias Larsson and Robin Frediksson of Mattman & Robin at Wolf Cousins Studios and Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, and at Interscope Studios in Santa Monica, California. Additional recording was handled by Juan Carlos Torrado and Noah Passovoy, while Serban Ghenea mixed the audio at Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia.|$|E

500|$|In the 1934 NFL Championship Game, the Giants {{defeated}} previously unbeaten Chicago 30–13 at the Polo Grounds on an icy {{field with}} temperatures peaking at 25 degrees. Before the game, team treasurer John Mara talked with Owen and team captain Flaherty about the field conditions. Flaherty suggested the Giants wear sneakers {{on the frozen}} field, as he had played in a game under similar circumstances at Gonzaga, and the sneakers proved to be effective. Mara dispatched equipment manager Abe Cohen {{to get as many}} sneakers as he could get. Due to traffic and the inability to find any athletic goods stores open on Sunday, Cohen was unable to return before the game started, and the Giants, wearing conventional footwear, trailed 10–3 {{at the end of the}} first half. Realizing time was short, Cohen went to Manhattan College — where he had a key to the equipment and locker rooms — and returned to the Polo Grounds at halftime with nine pairs of basketball sneakers, saying that [...] "nine pairs was <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get." [...] Players donned the sneakers and New York, after allowing Chicago another field goal late in the 3rd quarter, responded with 27 unanswered points in the 4th quarter to win their first NFL Championship game. The game would come to be known as [...] "The Sneakers Game", and the 27 points the Giants scored in the 4th quarter set a single–quarter championship game scoring record that stood for decades. After the game, offensive tackle Len Grant expressed his sincere gratitude by stating [...] "God bless Abe Cohen." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} overwhelmingly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote that [...] "as Chuck began laying out {{his plan to}} be freelance spies, and as Morgan took out the Intersect sunglasses General Beckman had so thoughtfully hidden in Chuck's going-away box, <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> feel was gratitude: I'm so glad NBC ordered one more season, because that is a show I want to see!" [...] Sepinwall praised Timothy Dalton's ability to deliver both a comic and serious performance, writing that, while on other series Volkoff's back-story [...] "would be an incredibly dark, tragic storyline", Dalton acted well enough that his emotions were not overwhelming. Sepinwall continued that the storyline [...] "would have sucked every last bit of joy out of the episode" [...] if the character had been portrayed by another Chuck actor. In contrast, Sepinwall wrote that he felt no empathy for Volkoff's daughter, as [...] "Lauren Cohan has never managed to make a cohesive and interesting character out {{of a bunch of}} jarring personality shifts". Brody Gibson of Boom Tron wrote," [...] The writers of Chuck sure know how to pull together a great finale. I was floored." [...] Gibson agreed with Sepinwall on Timothy Dalton's range of acting skills, praising Zachary Levi and Yvonne Strahovski as well. Gibson wrote that Levi deserved an Emmy nomination for a scene in which Chuck surrenders himself to Vivian to plead for the antidote to save Sarah's life. Gibson also praised Levi and Strahovski's performance in Chuck and Sarah's [...] "practice wedding": [...] "These two have always had such great chemistry, you could swear they're actually in love and not just actors pretending." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{they signed}} McBride, {{who had spent}} the 1934 season playing on a semi-pro team, before the game, the Western Division {{champion}} Bears were still 2½–1 favorites.

[...] Players donned the sneakers and the Giants, after allowing the Bears another field goal late in the third period, responded with 27 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to win their first NFL Championship game. When they took the lead 17–13 on a touchdown run by Strong, the game had to be stopped because hundreds of fans ran onto the field to celebrate. The game would come to be known as [...] "The Sneakers Game", and the 27 points the Giants scored in the fourth quarter set a single-quarter championship game scoring record that stood for decades. Fans converged on the field after the game, tearing down one of the goal posts. After the game offensive tackle Len Grant expressed his gratitude, saying [...] "God bless Abe Cohen." [...] Oddly, the team's performance was also aided by the consumption of alcohol. The team's trainer felt that whiskey could warm the players up, and he put some into their paper cups. Strong scored a touchdown on the next play, and the trainer did the same thing on the next drive, which again ended in a touchdown. Fearing drunkenness, water was returned to their cups once the team had the lead,.|$|E
