5|$|Modern Shift: In today’s society, we <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a {{shift in}} gender {{representation}} in the media particularly in the male fashion industry. Fashion designers are now starting to blur the lines between masculinity and femininity. In the first advertisement, the male has a very soft delicate hold on the rose compared to the typical aggressive grip men exhibit in ads. In the other two examples, both men are not only portraying the idea of feminine touch but the concept of self-touch as well.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{the global}} debate on climate change, along with {{regional}} geopolitical instabilities have challenged nations to act to develop both alternative and carbon-neutral sources of energy. Renewable fuels are therefore becoming attractive to many governments, who <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> sustainable energy independence {{as a valuable}} asset.|$|E
25|$|Malaysia is a multi-religious context where Western {{theological}} preoccupations are {{not always}} relevant. Lay leadership has developed strongly in most churches. Although there are many challenges through changing political and economic circumstances, like Malaysia itself, the churches <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{that they have a}} contribution to make on a larger stage.|$|E

60|$|Sheen {{admitted}} reluctantly that it had. He <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> things. It <b>is</b> never {{pleasant to}} feel {{one has been}} bluffed.|$|R
25|$|Clearly, SA has far {{reaching}} applications, as it {{is necessary}} for individuals and teams to function effectively in their environment. Thus, we <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> SA going beyond the field of aviation to work being conducted {{in a wide variety of}} environments. Currently, SA is being studied in such diverse areas as air traffic control, nuclear power plant operation, vehicle operation, and anesthesiology.|$|E
500|$|Many {{people in}} the {{community}} wrote of how much they enjoyed their experience and, in particular, the light-hearted atmosphere. One participant, a man named John Codman, joined the community at the age of 27 in 1843. He wrote, [...] "It was for the meanest a life above humdrum, and for the greatest something far, infinitely far beyond. They looked into the gates of life and saw beyond charming visions, and hopes springing up for all". The idealism of the community sometimes was not met, however. Because the community was officially secular, a variety of religions were represented, though not always amicably. When Isaac Hecker and, later, Sophia Ripley converted to Catholicism, a Protestant Brook Farmer complained, [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> wooden crosses around and pictures of saints... and I suspect that rosaries are rattling under aprons." ...|$|E
2500|$|Copper will {{continue}} to be the predominant material in most electrical wire applications, especially where space considerations are important. The automotive industry for decades has considered the use of smaller-diameter wires in certain applications. Many manufacturers are beginning to use copper alloys such as copper-magnesium (CuMg), which allow for smaller diameter wires with less weight and improved conductivity performance. [...] Special alloys like copper-magnesium <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> increased usage in automotive, aerospace, and defense applications.|$|E

50|$|With {{the merger}} of RTÉ Relays and DCS many {{customers}} <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> better reception due to the integration of both systems, Cablelink had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> reduce head‐ends which help with reception issues.|$|R
2500|$|The {{third part}} of the novel takes place on the Moon. [...] Lunar society is {{diverging}} radically from that of Earth. [...] The lower gravity has produced people with a very different physique. [...] Their food supply is manufactured from algae and distasteful to inhabitants of Earth. [...] They enjoy low-gravity sports that would be impossible on Earth, such as an acrobatic game like [...] "tag" [...] performed in a huge cylinder (these sports are vital to them, since their metabolism is still that of Earthmen, and proper strenuous exercise must be maintained for it to function properly). [...] Some Lunarites want to further adapt their bodies to life on the Moon, but Earth has outlawed genetic engineering decades ago. [...] Lunarites <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> themselves as a separate race, although procreation between them and Earth people is quite common. Sex, however, is problematic, since an Earthborn person is likely to injure his or her partner due to loss of control. Sexual morals are loose, and nudity is not taboo.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the latter}} part of the 20th century, the burger has {{undergone}} several controversies regarding its nutritional values. In an era in which a growing amount of the world's population has become either overweight or more conscious of weight and the need for a healthy diet in general, the appearance of exceptionally larger burgers (popularly known as [...] "XXL hamburgers") has generated considerable controversy. One example of this is the Triple Whopper, which surpasses the one thousand calorie threshold established by the Health Strategy Against Obesity, which is promoted by the health institutes of the Spanish Association of Food and Nutrition Safety (AESAN). AESAN works to prevent the growth of the incidence of obesity in all people, particularly children. More generally, dietitians <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that the consumption of foods high in calories can cause excessive appetite. In response to this message, many restaurant chains have reduced the calories in their burgers since the beginning of the 20th century. The late 20th century witnessed a lawsuit brought by McDonald's against two environmental activists, Helen Steel and David Morris, that was colloquially known as McLibel. McDonald's took action following the publication of a pamphlet by Steel and Morris that was entitled What’s wrong with McDonald’s: Everything they don’t want you to know, which was subsequently developed into a documentary called McLibel.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Bless me,' {{said the}} vicar, taking out his watch, 'it is {{a quarter to}} twelve. 'Yes, yes, Mrs Lawford,' he trotted round to the door. 'We <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> light--a ray!' ...|$|E

5000|$|The station's owners {{decided to}} add the Top 40 format to KYND (92.9 FM). The {{beautiful}} music format on 92.9 <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a decline in ratings as younger listeners thought of the format as [...] "elevator music." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{rediscovery of}} lost {{classical}} works (The Renaissance) and scientific advancement {{led to a}} steadily increasing disbelief in superstition. A new, more rationalistic lens <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> use in exegesis. Opposition to superstition was central to the Age of Enlightenment.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{it in that}} light, my dear, {{and if you can}} think of {{anything}} to do by morning I shall be humbly thankful. I don't expect to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's the uselessness of it, {{for this}} age," [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I think clergymen don't {{understand}} the harm {{it is doing}} in concentrating the attention on such a vulnerable and non-essential point. Those {{of us who are}} striving to reorganize our beliefs and make them tenable, do not bother our heads about miracles. They may be true, or may not, or some of them may be. We <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that the virgin birth does not add anything to Christ. We <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that perfection and individuality are not incompatible,--one is divine, and the other human. And isn't it by his very individuality that we are able to recognize Jesus to-day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now {{you have}} seen me," [...] {{returned}} the smiling girl, whose unmoved and natural manner proved how little {{she was thinking of}} anything more than parental or fraternal regard, [...] "you <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the folly of forming friendships for people before you know anything about them, except by hearsay." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I wish {{others would}} follow your example in that latter habit,' said I, respectfully, for I <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that there <b>was</b> {{something}} in my bird, though he was hollow. 'Will you allow me to ask if the other statues in the city fly by night?' ...|$|R
60|$|The old man scowled {{round on}} the people nearest him {{and down on the}} crowd below. The believers waited in anxious silence; the unbelievers applauded his humor with {{friendly}} laughter, and a kindlier spirit spread through them; they <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Dylks as a joke.|$|R
6000|$|... "My seat must go, {{if this is}} to be the price," [...] said Raymond. [...] "I felt {{through all}} the speeches at that gilt-gingerbread place, that it was a {{monument}} of my truckling to expediency. We began the whole thing at the wrong end, and I fear we <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the effects." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps it {{is because}} of my {{suspicious}} nature," [...] Peter said. [...] "There is a man staying in our hotel whom we <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> quite a great deal of. He was talking to the head porter a few minutes before you this afternoon. He supped at the same restaurant last night. He is dining now three places behind you to the right, with a young lady who has been making flagrant attempts at flirtation with me, notwithstanding my gray hairs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{soon as you}} like," [...] {{answered}} Dan, [...] "or, rather, as soon as Elspie likes. You see, {{things are}} beginning {{to look a little}} more hopeful now. People who seem to know best--or seem to think they do--tell us that the Nor'-Westers <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that a colony here won't interfere in any way with their business; a good deal of seed has been sown, and, if all goes well, we may look for a better year than we have yet had; therefore I don't see why we should wait any longer." ...|$|E
50|$|The Lower East Side, {{once known}} for its large Jewish {{community}} of German and Eastern European Jews before an influx of newer immigrants, <b>is</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a slight resurgence in the Jewish character of the neighborhood, led by the Stanton Street Synagogue, Congregation Bnai Jacob Anshei Brzezan.|$|R
6000|$|... "Una!" [...] he said. He {{had been}} very blind, but he <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> He took a step nearer and took her hands. She threw up her head and gazed, blushingly, steadfastly, into his eyes. From {{the folds of her}} gown she drew forth the little packet of letters and kissed it.|$|R
60|$|The {{only two}} men who still cared nothing about it were Geoffrey and the surgeon. There sat the first, stolidly neutral--indifferent alike to the attack and the defense. There stood the second, {{pursuing}} his investigation--with the growing interest in it {{of a man who}} <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his way <b>to</b> the end.|$|R
60|$|And what is healing {{but growing}} again? And {{how could the}} atoms of your fingers grow, and make fresh skin, {{if they were not}} each of them alive? There, I will not puzzle you with too much at once; you will know more about all that some day. Only {{remember}} now, that there is nothing wonderful in the world outside you but has its counterpart of something just as wonderful, and perhaps more wonderful, inside you. Man is the microcosm, the little world, said the philosophers of old; and philosophers nowadays <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that their old guess is actual fact and true.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{yet it was}} in {{the cause}} of France,' {{returned}} the Emperor. Then, turning to us, he took old Tremeau by the ear. 'Ah, old grumbler,' said he, 'you were one of my Egyptian grenadiers, were you not, and had your musket of honour at Marengo. I remember you very well, my good friend. So the old fires are not yet extinguished! They still burn up when you think that your Emperor is wronged. And you, Colonel Despienne, you would not even listen to the tempter. And you, Gerard, your faithful sword is ever to be between me and my enemies. Well, well, I have had some traitors about me, but now at last we <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> who are the true men.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{never will}} be," [...] said Mr. Bingham. [...] "You'll never make a burglar. I'm glad you <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it. In {{choosing}} a profession a man must study his temperament. If you don't, {{sooner or later}} you will fail. Compare myself, for example. All my life I have been in banks--I have got on in banks. I have even been a bank manager. But was I happy? No. Why wasn't I happy? Because it did not suit my temperament. I am too adventurous--too versatile. Practically I have thrown it over. I do not suppose I shall ever manage a bank again. They would be glad to get me, no doubt; but I have learnt the lesson of my temperament--at last.... No! I shall never manage a bank again.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the housing}} market has boomed in Philadelphia, the {{neighborhood}} has <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> some resurgence. Where the former housing projects intersect with the neighborhood, a group of neighbors have started turning an empty lot into a new park at 30th and Oakford, and the area <b>is</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a trickle of young professionals overflowing from the nearby Graduate Hospital area.|$|R
50|$|Initially, the {{governing}} coalition expected the unearned wage increases {{and the consequent}} increase in government spending to be corrected once the 'structural changes' like nationalisation and agrarian reforms were completed. However, by June 1972, Allende <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the economic hazards. The minister of economy was changed and some austerity measures introduced, but to little avail.|$|R
60|$|That {{it should}} {{make him feel}} a {{worm-like}} humility had not entered his calculations. He <b>was</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> something of the possibilities of love. His tentative excursions into the unknown emotion, while at college, had never really deceived him; even {{at the time a}} sort of second self had looked on and sneered at the poor imitation.|$|R
