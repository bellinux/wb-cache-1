5|$|Paciorek, {{who was the}} {{starting}} right fielder, began the day with <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> the second inning. He then had a single in the fourth inning, which drove in Rusty Staub and Bob Aspromonte. After singling and again bringing home Aspromonte in the fifth, Paciorek had <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> the sixth, and ended {{the day with a}} leadoff single in the eighth. In total, he went to the plate five times and hit three singles and had two walks, scoring four runs en route to a 134 Houston victory over the New York Mets. He had a perfect major league career batting average and on-base percentage of 1.000 {{as a result of his}} performance that day, something no one else with as many plate appearances as Paciorek has done.|$|E
5|$|The impasse {{is broken}} by the return of Miss Prism, whom Lady Bracknell {{recognises}} as the person who, twenty-eight years earlier, as a family nursemaid, had taken a baby boy for <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> a perambulator (baby carriage) and never returned. Challenged, Miss Prism explains that she had absentmindedly put the manuscript of a novel she was writing in the perambulator, and the baby in a handbag, which she had left at Victoria Station. Jack produces the very same handbag, showing {{that he is the}} lost baby, the elder son of Lady Bracknell's late sister, and thus Algernon's elder brother. Having acquired such respectable relations, he is acceptable as a suitor for Gwendolen after all.|$|E
5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Nemo sprang from multiple experiences, {{going back to}} director Andrew Stanton's childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home. In 1992, shortly after his son was born, {{he and his family}} took a trip to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater world could be done beautifully in computer animation. Later, in 1997, he took his son for <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> the park, but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe discuss multi-dimensional generalizations of multicanonical algorithm, {{simulated}} tempering, and replica-exchange method. We generalize {{the original}} potential energy function E 0 by adding any physical quantity V of interest {{as a new}} energy term with a coupling constant λ. We then perform a multi-dimensional multicanonical simulation where <b>a</b> random <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> E 0 and V space is realized. We can alternately perform a multi-dimensional simulated-tempering simulation where <b>a</b> random <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> temperature T and parameter λ is realized. The results of the multi-dimensional replica-exchange simulations {{can be used to}} determine the weight factors for these multi-dimensional multicanonical and simulated tempering simulations. Two examples of the above methods are presented for biomoleculr systems where the parameter λ corresponds to the solvation parameter and the pressure. In the former, <b>a</b> random <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> the conformational energy and solvation free energy is performed, and in the latter, <b>a</b> random <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> the potential energy and volume is realized...|$|R

Monty is a melodramatic aesthete and Marwood realises he is homosexual. The three briefly drink together as Withnail casually lies to Monty about his acting career and lies that Marwood went to Eton. Before leaving, Withnail arranges to borrow the cottage.|$|E
25|$|The tie was broken, however, in {{the bottom}} of the seventh. Chono lead off the inning with a walk and was quickly {{advanced}} to second on a sacrifice bunt from Tetsuya Matsumoto. Two batters later, Shinnosuke Abe hit a single up the middle of the field to earn what proved to be the game-winning RBI. Abe returned to the Giants roster for Game 6 after missing the previous two games because of discomfort in his right leg. Scott Mathieson then threw a scoreless eighth and Tetsuya Yamaguchi earned the save by keeping the Fighters from capitalizing on a hit and <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> <b>in</b> the ninth.|$|E

25|$|Zoo-keeping {{seems in}} fact, in the {{surviving}} evidence, {{the most common}} work performed by dwarfs. Royal zookeepers mostly {{took care of the}} king's pets such as hunting dogs, domestic cats and guenons. This may be because these animals were very easy to tame and would not become a danger to the dwarfs. A unique relief from the mastaba of the high official Nyankhnesw (6th Dynasty) shows a dwarf taking a leopard for <b>a</b> <b>walk.</b> <b>In</b> another tomb (that of the high official Nofer, also of the 6th Dynasty), one relief shows a dwarf and his guenon while the little ape pilfers grapes from a fruit basket and plays with his cord. Further Old Kingdom reliefs suggest that guenons literally assisted their keepers: in the tomb of Kaaper a unique relief depicts a dwarf and his guenon, as they both specify the clock for a pair of musicians. In contrast, depictions of dwarfs working themselves as musicians are very rare.|$|E
25|$|In 1749 {{her father}} was {{appointed}} to a position as Canon-Residentiary at Lichfield Cathedral and {{the family moved to}} that city, where her father educated her entirely at home. They lived in the Bishop's Palace in the Cathedral Close. When a family friend, Mrs. Edward Sneyd, died in 1756, the Sewards took in one of her daughters, Honora Sneyd, who became an 'adopted' foster sister to Anna. Honora was nine years younger than Anna. Anna Seward describes how she and her sister first met Honora, on returning from <b>a</b> <b>walk,</b> <b>in</b> her poem The Anniversary (1769). Sarah (known as 'Sally') died suddenly at the age of nineteen of typhus (1764). Sarah was said to be of admirable character, but less talented than her sister. Anna consoled herself with her affection for Honora Sneyd, as she describes in Visions, written a few days after her sister's death. In the poem she expresses the hope that Honora ('this transplanted flower') will replace her sister (whom she refers to as 'Alinda') in her and her parents affections.|$|E
