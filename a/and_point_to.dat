5|$|Orangutans {{are among}} the most {{intelligent}} primates. Experiments suggest they can figure out some invisible displacement problems with a representational strategy. In addition, Zoo Atlanta has a touch-screen computer where their two Sumatran orangutans play games. Scientists hope the data they collect will help researchers learn about socialising patterns, such as whether the apes learn behaviours through trial and error or by mimicry, <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> new conservation strategies.|$|E

Stations such as Sandy Lodge (now Moor Park) were built to serve golf courses and hunts along the route, and horse-vans were provided at stations serving hunts <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> points.

5|$|Thus Meher Baba {{offers many}} {{suggestions}} that keep one moving towards God-realization. These suggestions include putting theory into practice, the internal renunciation of desires, offering selfless service to humanity or the master, spontaneity, while avoiding actions that bind one to illusion. But rather than lay out moral rules, Baba offers an understanding {{as to why}} some actions bind the individual whereas some others help towards his emancipation. Many chapters offer {{a better understanding of}} the mechanisms by which consciousness gets caught up between the opposites of experience, such as pleasure and pain, good and evil, <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> a way of transcending them.|$|E
25|$|Joe Nickell {{argues that}} results similar to Heller and Adler's could be {{obtained}} from tempera paint. Skeptics also cite other forensic blood tests whose results dispute {{the authenticity of the}} Shroud, <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the possibility that the blood could belong to a person handling the shroud, and that the apparent blood flows on the shroud are unrealistically neat.|$|E
25|$|Many {{scholars}} have provided excellent commentaries on Makin's An Essay. While {{some of the}} criticism on Makin considers her work too conventional to be wholly classified as feminist, Nancy Weitz (Miller), Mitzi Myers, James L.

25|$|Lack of {{confidence}} within Adventism – Raymond F. Cottrell, {{claimed that the}} investigative judgment doctrine lacks support within Adventist academia <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the “Committee on Problems {{in the book of}} Daniel”, convened in the 1960s, which failed to produce any conclusions despite 5 years of labour. However, see the 7 volumes produced by the Biblical Research Institute on Daniel & Revelation.|$|E
25|$|Responding to the {{intensification}} of alienation and irrationality in an advanced capitalist society, critical theory is a comprehensive, ideology-critical, historically self-reflective body of theory aiming simultaneously to explain domination <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the possibilities of bringing about a rational, humane, and free society. Frankfurt School critical theorists developed numerous theories of the economic, political, cultural, and psychological domination structures of advanced industrial civilization.|$|E
25|$|Highly {{conservative}} Protestants such as Mary Pride, Charles D. Provan, Hess and Hess, and Rachel Scott, {{argue that}} Protestants {{should not have}} moved away from traditional Protestant views of contraception such as given by Martin Luther and John Calvin. Such modern authors contrast the views of early Reformers who rejected contraception with modern Christians who accept it, <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> primarily feminist, secular, or Satanic influences as causative to the change.|$|E

25|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}} is very vague {{about the ways}} to determine when splitting happens, and nowadays usually the criterion {{is that the two}} branches have decohered. However, present day understanding of decoherence does not allow a completely precise, self-contained way to say when the two branches have decohered/"do not interact", and hence many-worlds interpretation remains arbitrary. This objection is saying that {{it is not clear what}} is precisely meant by branching, <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the lack of self-contained criteria specifying branching.|$|E
25|$|The {{linguistic}} part {{traces the}} connections between the various Indo-European languages, and reconstructs the proto-Indo-European language. This is possible because the processes that change languages are not random, but follow strict patterns. Especially sound shifts, the changing of vowels and consonants, are important, although grammar (especially morphology) and the lexicon (vocabulary) may also be significant. Historical-comparative linguistics thus {{makes it possible to}} see great similarities between languages which at first sight might seem very different. Various characteristics of the Indo-European languages argue against an Indian origin of these languages, <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> a steppe origin of these languages.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Kırkdilim {{was fought}} in July 1391 or 1392 between the Ottoman sultan Bayezid I and Kadi Burhan al-Din, ruler of northeastern Anatolia. The {{details of the}} battle are debated: Burhan al-Din's court poet Ibn Ardashir {{presents}} Bayezid's campaign being ended by a major victory for his master, which temporarily halted Ottoman expansion in Anatolia, but the contemporary letters of Manuel II Palaiologos, who accompanied Bayezid on his Anatolian campaigns, contain no indications of a major clash, <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the expedition having been overall an Ottoman success.|$|E

25|$|It {{is often}} {{recommended}} to age ripened pu'er to air out the unpleasant musty flavors and odors formed due to maocha fermentation. However, some collectors argue that keeping ripened pu'er longer than 10 to 15 years makes little sense, {{stating that the}} tea will not develop further and possibly lose its desirable flavors. Others note that their experience has taught them that ripened pu'er indeed does take on nuances through aging, <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> side-by-side taste comparisons of ripened pu'er of different ages. Aging the tea increases its value, but may be unprofitable.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} life on Earth is biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metamorphized sedimentary rocks discovered in Western Greenland and microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia. A 2015 study found potentially biogenic carbon from 4.1 billion years ago in ancient rocks in Western Australia, but such findings would indicate the existence of different conditions on Earth during that period from those generally assumed today, <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> an earlier origin of life. In 2017, there was published a description of putative fossilized microorganisms that are at least 3.77 billion, and possibly 4.28 billion years old, in ferruginous sedimentary rocks in Quebec, Canada.|$|E
25|$|The {{church is}} located at Kirkheugh or Kirkhill. This location, where the modern North Street and South Street converge, {{may have been the}} {{original}} location of the religious site before {{the construction of a new}} cathedral building slightly to the west (the remains of which constitute St Rule's Tower) by Robert, Bishop of St Andrews. There are burials in the vicinity of Kirkheugh that pre-date the alleged eighth-century foundation of the monastery, <b>and</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> a small religious community from the sixth-century. There were also a number of tenth-century cross-slabs found in the grounds. The church was said by John Lesley to have been pulled down by reforming Protestants in June 1559.|$|E
