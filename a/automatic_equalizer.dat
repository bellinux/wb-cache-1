Some also include user-adjustable equalization that allows boosted or reduced output at particular frequencies; these vary {{from a simple}} [...] "boost" [...] switch, to fully parametric equalizers meant for detailed speaker and room correction. Some such systems are even supplied with a calibrated microphone to measure the subwoofer's in-room response, so the <b>automatic</b> <b>equalizer</b> can correct the combination of subwoofer, subwoofer location, and room response to minimize effects of room modes and improve low frequency performance.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} torus-shaped <b>automatic</b> <b>equalizer</b> with {{vertical}} axis {{the body of}} which is placed relatively to the rotation axis. <b>Automatic</b> <b>equalizer</b> with torus-shaped adjustment mass moving freely within the autoequalizer's body both circularly and crosswise. Automatic equalizer's torus-shaped form reduces to the minimum the force of resistance when the ball moves, but simultaneously decreases the chance of launching the <b>automatic</b> <b>equalizer</b> in the autobalancing regime. The main task of the research {{is to determine the}} torus-shaped cross-section's size effect on the ball's motion mode. The <b>automatic</b> <b>equalizer</b> is made up of the mathematical model with two differential equations. Differential motion equations in rotor system with <b>automatic</b> <b>equalizer</b> are investigated by the hep of SPRING software, whith allows to calculate the ball motion...|$|E
40|$|A new mean-square-error <b>automatic</b> <b>equalizer</b> for {{synchronous}} data transmission is developed. It utilizes Rosen's gradient-projection method to optimize parameters in the discrete frequency domain. The algorithm converges (in the mean) for any channel {{even in the}} presence of noise. It is shown that for the channels considered, convergence is faster (in a bounded sense) than for comparable time-domain equalizers...|$|E
25|$|An <b>automatic</b> {{adaptive}} <b>equalizer</b> corrects distorted signals, greatly improving data {{performance and}} speed. All computer modems use <b>equalizers.</b> The <b>automatic</b> adaptive <b>equalizer</b> {{was invented in}} 1965 by Bell Laboratories electrical engineer Robert Lucky.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an <b>automatic</b> optical <b>equalizer</b> {{based on a}} pair of in-house developed high efficiency, acousto-optic variable optical attenuators (AO-VOAs). The system is polarization insensitive and presents a wide bandwidth compatible with coarse wavelength division multiplexing (CWDM) requirements: 340 [*]nm. The system operation is automatic and bidirectional and equalization is obtained in one single iteration of algorithm loop...|$|R

50|$|ModPlug Player is {{a module}} file player {{developed}} by Olivier Lapicque {{in conjunction with}} the original ModPlug Tracker project and the ModPlug Browser plugin. Features include a playlist editor, graphical <b>equalizer,</b> <b>automatic</b> gain control, bass expansion, reverb, Dolby Surround Sound support and the ability to mix two modules simultaneously and to change their pitch and tempo. The player supports a variety of module music files in both native and compressed (ZIP / RAR / LHA) formats.|$|R
