25|$|Around 7.5 {{million people}} of Ivory Coast {{made up the}} work force in 2009. The work force took a hit, {{especially}} in the private sector, during the early 2000s due to the numerous economic crises since 1999. Furthermore, these crises caused companies to close and move locations, especially in Ivory Coast's tourism industry, transit and banking companies. Job markets decreasing posed as <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> <b>issue</b> in Ivory Coast society as unemployment rates grew. Unemployment rates raised to 9.4% in 2012.|$|E
25|$|Since 1972, {{however, the}} U.K. has fallen under the cross-border-competition law regime of the European Community, which is found {{primarily}} in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty of the European Community. Companies that form a cartel or collude to disrupt competition (Article 81) or to abuse a dominant {{position in the}} market – for instance through a monopoly (Article 82) – face fines from the public-enforcement authorities, {{and in some cases}} they also face a cause of action in tort. <b>A</b> <b>huge</b> <b>issue</b> in the E.U. is whether to follow the U.S. approach of private damages actions to prevent anti-competitive conduct. In other words, the question is what should be seen as a private wrong (as was held in the vertical restraints case of Courage Ltd v Crehan) and what should be seen as a public wrong where only public enforcers are competent to impose penalties. In 1998 the United Kingdom brought its legislation up to date, with the Competition Act 1998, followed by the Enterprise Act 2002, a regime mirroring that of the European Union. The domestic enforcers are the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission.|$|E

Justin Carlson, the creator of a skin selling online marketplace website called SkinXchange, said underage gambling is <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> <b>issue,</b> and there were [...] "countless times" [...] where he's had to call parents to tell them their child had used their credit card to buy items.

2500|$|The test {{became an}} {{international}} incident. In a PBS interview, the historian Martha Smith argued: [...] "In Japan, it becomes <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> <b>issue</b> {{in terms of}} not just the government and its protest against the United States, but all different groups and all different peoples in Japan start to protest. It becomes a big issue in the media. There {{are all kinds of}} letters and protests that come from, not surprisingly, Japanese fishermen, the fishermen's wives; there are student groups, all different types of people; that protest against the Americans' use of the Pacific for nuclear testing. They're very concerned about, first of all, why the United States even has the right to be carrying out those kinds of tests in the Pacific. They're also concerned about the health and environmental impact." [...] The Prime Minister of India [...] "voiced the heightened international concern" [...] when he called for the elimination of all nuclear testing worldwide.|$|E

The ethical boundary is <b>a</b> <b>huge,</b> <b>huge</b> <b>issue.</b> But then also there's this question of boundaries in a relationship.

50|$|The Otago Regional Council, {{responsible}} for the area, has recognised that in such an event, tsunamis could occur in both lakes but have yet to learn any more about it. This is interesting as if an event was to happen in peak seasons such as summer around Christmas, or in the snow season when the population of these areas nearly double, it would pose <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> management <b>issue.</b> The reason for this <b>huge</b> management <b>issue</b> is the volume of people in these areas would be unknown and supplies and aid would be insufficient. In summer a lot of temporary structures such as tents are {{put up on the}} lake shore, these tents provide no protection from a tsunami wave. This is why it is so important to investigate what would happen in such an event so that people can be educated in order to reduce vulnerability in these areas.|$|R
50|$|For the Renault management, {{success at}} Le Mans was <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> {{prestige}} <b>issue.</b> For the 1977 race the Renault Sport works team fielded three cars, drafted in endurance specialist Derek Bell, and {{were supported by}} an additional, privately entered A442. In the intervening period between the two Le Mans starts, the Renault Alpines had taken second and third places in the 500 km ACF race at Dijon-Prenois, as well as second place at the high-speed 4h Monza round. Expectation and publicity levels were high. It was therefore something of an embarrassment when {{not one of the}} four cars reached the finishing flag. Renault's yellow and black liveried squad did not compare favourably with the white Martini Racing Porsche 936 and Porsche 935. In both World Championship series of 1976, these reliable, fast cars scored repeated wins.|$|R

However, being informed and concerned is not a replacement for action. Even though there are increasing numbers of political messages, information, and advertisements available through traditional media and online media, political participation continues to decline. People pay close attention to the media, but there is an overexposure of messages that can get confusing and contradictory so people do not get involved in the political process.|$|R

50|$|The Centre is divided, {{according}} to its programme, into three different buildings which are connected by two roof surfaces. Clay for the building was brought from 5 km away, so that the red colour would contrast with the colour of the local buildings, which are all made using traditional mud construction. The rusty red colour of the laterite clay is due to its high iron oxide content. All the walls and barrel vaults in the Centre are made out of BTC (compressed earth blocks) and are not plastered or painted. These are very well suited to the climatic conditions as they create a natural temperature buffer, making indoor temperatures much more comfortable. The overhanging roof blocks keep the walls cool and provide shaded outdoor spaces. The building is naturally ventilated through openings in the walls and vaults, therefore mechanical air-conditioning is not needed. Most vernacular buildings in Mopti have wooden ceilings filled with clay. Kéré uses a new system in this building that involves no wood - BTC vaults. He wants to promote the use of clay but to be sparing in his use of wood, as deforestation is <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> environmental <b>issue</b> in Mali.|$|R

Long-term exposure to pollutants can cause health risks such as respiratory diseases, cancer, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Coal is <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> <b>issue</b> because of the SO2 emissions from coal factories.

In Australia it is proven that nearly 40% of males and 60% of females do not do enough physical activity a day. Introducing aerobic exercise to a daily routine would benefit the body and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. The Australian Heart Foundation guidelines outline that exercise to reduce fat should involve continuous moderate aerobic exercise. Continuous moderate exercise is easily accessible and should be performed for at least 30 minutes five times a week. This will reduce obesity by 19% versus no activity at all.|$|E
