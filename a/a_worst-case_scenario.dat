5|$|In the {{two centuries}} since the hurricane, the oceans rose about , the {{wetlands}} around New Orleans have diminished, and the elevation has dropped due to subsidence. These {{have increased the}} threat to the city of a significant hurricane strike. The 1812 hurricane was not <b>a</b> <b>worst-case</b> <b>scenario</b> for New Orleans, as a stronger and larger hurricane would have caused more damage. If the storm struck in 2012, one researcher estimated the hurricane would have been among the costliest Louisiana hurricanes, comparable to Hurricane Betsy in 1965 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the storm's projected path into the Gulf of Mexico, prices for crude oil rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange at branch offices in London. Natural gas prices rose considerably in New York Mercantile Exchange electronic trading on August 2. Anticipation {{of a threat to}} supply by a potential Hurricane Chris coupled with high demand during an ongoing heat wave were cited as factors in the price move. In New Orleans, officials including Mayor Ray Nagin prepared for a possible evacuation of the city if Chris entered the Gulf of Mexico as a hurricane. The evacuation plan included moving all residents out of the city as <b>a</b> <b>worst-case</b> <b>scenario,</b> intended to avoid a re-occurrence of Hurricane Katrina around one year prior. Florida Emergency Management requested ten mobile recovery centers, and placed hospitals in the Florida Keys on standby for evacuation. Officials in Mississippi identified the need for 110 to assist in an evacuation process in case of a possible landfall. Both Louisiana and Texas emergency operation centers monitored the progress of the storm, though did not execute any preparation action.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo {{eventually}} migrated {{the development}} of Ocarina of Time from disk to cartridge media due to the high data performance requirements imposed by continuously reading 500 motion-captured character animations throughout gameplay, intending to follow its release with a 64DD expansion disk. At its release, the 32-megabyte game would be the largest game Nintendo had ever created. Early in the game's development, concerns about the data storage constraints of the N64 cartridge led producer and supervisor Shigeru Miyamoto to imagine <b>a</b> <b>worst-case</b> <b>scenario</b> in which Ocarina of Time would follow a similar structure to Super Mario 64 with Link being restricted to Ganondorf's castle as a central hub, and using a portal system similar to the paintings that Mario uses to traverse the realm.

Project costs range between $5,000 and $150,000, although the average is between $20,000 and $25,000. The protected areas that result from these deals typically involve a 20- to 30-year commitment. Seacology hopes that during that time the local people grow to respect these resources and ideally progress {{to a point where}} they are less dependent on natural resources. According to marine biologist Mark Erdmann, in <b>a</b> <b>worst-case</b> <b>scenario,</b> if the people violate the contract and destroy the habitat, Seacology will have still made a difference in their lives through its low-cost investment, whereas larger conservation organizations might invest large sums of money but through not addressing the immediate needs of the people, if the project fails, both lose that investment and not have helped the community.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe pace of {{urbanization}} and industrialization {{in developing countries}} is rapidly increasing. Unfortunately, regulatory and private-sector control of hazards has not always kept pace. This work identifies the level of emergency preparedness in chemical industries and evaluates the spatial distribution of hazards using <b>a</b> <b>worst-case</b> release <b>scenario.</b> Consequently, we identified potentially exposed urban communities and evaluated the social perception of a hazard. This research characterizes risk scenarios in {{a case study of}} the industrial area in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. Intervention zones of major concern are recognized when deficiencies in emergency preparedness join a poor social perception of hazards in communities that are potentially exposed. The <b>worst-case</b> <b>scenario</b> radii of flammable chemicals range from 425 m to 733 m. Potentially exposed communities have a limited perception of chemical risk and no training in emergency response. Proximity to an industrial area influences communities towards a better recognition of hazards. However, communities far from the industrial area have higher exposure to low preparedness <b>worst-case</b> <b>scenarios</b> for flammable chemicals and have a larger level of vulnerability because of their lack of risk perception...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a new life}} cycle model that aims to describe the savings and asset allocation choices of boundedly rational agents. In this model, agents make forward-looking decisions without the requirement of anticipating their actual future decisions. Instead, agents pursue two simple so-called feasibility goals. The first goal entails assuring feasibility of a certain minimum consumption level in <b>a</b> future <b>worst-case</b> <b>scenario.</b> The second concerns feasibility of a certain standard {{of living in a}} normal scenario. The feasibility goals framework represents a particularly natural alternative to the standard rational benchmark model. The framework is highly tractable and parsimonious. In particular, it is able to explain important empirical patterns of asset allocation that are puzzling {{from the point of view}} of existing models. ...|$|R

30|$|If we take {{southbound}} transports to Helsingborg as an example, in 5  % of all transports {{the delay}} is almost 2  h (118.9  min) or more {{according to the}} percentile value. That is, once per 20 transports a delay of this size or larger is expected to happen southwards, and since there are two trains per day (one northbound and one southbound), it means that once every 10  days {{or three times a}} month a delay of this magnitude occurs. The average delay in each percentile is the conditional tail expectation (CTE). For example, going north to Bro there is a 10  % probability of a delay of at least 1  h. The average within the percentile is close to 2.5  h, so that with a 10  % probability (once every 10 transports or once every 5  days) COOP has to expect an average delay of 2.5  h. Hence, the CTE gives a better estimate of how big the risk is in the tail of the delay distribution. 10 Whereas the percentile values mark the best outcome of any given <b>worst-case</b> <b>scenario</b> (e.g. 10  % worst cases), the CTE gives the average for <b>a</b> given <b>worst-case</b> <b>scenario.</b>|$|R

Compared to purely stochastic PDEs or purely fuzzy PDEs, which can treat either only random or only non-random uncertainty in physical systems, fuzzy-stochastic PDEs offer powerful models for accurate description and propagation of the hybrid random and non-random uncertainties inevitable in many real applications. We will use the level-set representation of fuzzy functions and define the solution to fuzzy-stochastic PDE problems through a corresponding parametric problem, and further present theoretical results on the well-posedness and regularity of such problems. Considering the interaction between the input fuzzy variables, we propose <b>a</b> sampling-based <b>worst-case</b> <b>scenario</b> strategy for computing fuzzy-stochastic output quantities.

40|$|Transition toward smart {{distribution}} networks {{with high}} penetration of photovoltaics (PVs) will involve incidental generation curtailment {{as an alternative}} to grid reinforcements. Microinverters are taking over popularity of string inverters in residential and some commercial areas mainly due to increased energy harvest.

First, <b>a</b> single <b>worst-case</b> <b>scenario</b> was used to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed curtailment schemes: the distribution network operators can optimize between various priorities such as total feeder output, economic equality between connected parties, voltage levels, voltage unbalance, and curtailment execution time.
