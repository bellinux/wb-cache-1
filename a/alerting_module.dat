40|$|The latter {{parts of}} 2007 and {{early months of}} 2008 {{witnessed}} an alarming number of deaths due to a Leptospirosis outbreak in Sri Lanka(1). An unusual number of patients presenting with symptoms of fever, headache or myalgia concentrated in particular geographic areas (North Central and North Western Province in Sri Lanka) could have signalled the epidemiologists of an abnormal event {{with the help of}} a quicker surveillance programme leading to possible implementation of optimal strategies which could possibly have minimized the early deaths and even prevented the progression of the outbreak. The present day paper-based disease surveillance and notification systems in Sri Lanka(2), confined to a set of notifiable diseases, often require 15 - 30 days to communicate data and for the central Epidemiology Unit to process it. This latency does not allow for timely detection of disease outbreaks and it limits the ability of the health system to effectively respond and mitigate their consequences. Therefore it negatively affects the health status of the work force and productivity of the country. The Real Time Bio-surveillance Program (RTBP) is a pilot study aiming to introduce modern technology to the Health Department of Sri Lanka to complement the existing disease surveillance and notification systems. The processes involve digitizing all clinical health records and analysing them in near real-time to detect unusual events to forewarn health workers before the diseases reach epidemic states. Similar studies have been conducted on bio terrorism surveillance in Winnipeg, Canada(3), pandemic surveillance in Morocco(4) and North Carolina Disease Event Tracking and Epidemiologic Collection Tool (NC DETECT) in North Carolina(5). The infrastructure of the project RTBP is composed of an interconnected network between health care workers via mHealthSurvey mobile phone application, T-Cube web interface (TCWI) and Sahana Messaging/Alerting Module. Health records from health facilities, namely demographic information, symptoms, suspected and diagnosed diseases are collected through the mHealthSurvey, a mobile phone application(6), that feed in to the TCWI(7), a browser based software tool that detects adverse events; health officials are notified of the adverse events using the Sahana <b>Alerting</b> <b>module</b> that transports via Short Message Service (SMS), Email, and Web(10). Evaluation of the RTBP involves a replication study and parallel cohort study. This pilot study indicates the need for more robust mobile application for data collection with complete ontology, semantics and vocabulary in disease-syndrome information to reduce noise and increase reliability in the datasets. More rigorous capacity building and frequent use is required for health officials to take advantage of the full potential of TCWI. This paper discusses the technologies used in the pilot and the initial findings in relation to usability of the system...|$|E
40|$|As ad-hoc {{networks}} have different characteristics from a wired network, the intrusion detection techniques used for wired networks {{are no longer}} sufficient and effective when adapted directly to a wireless ad-hoc network. In this article, first τhe security challenges in intrusion detection for ad-hoc networks are identified and the related work for anomaly detection is discussed. We then propose a layered intrusion detection framework, which consists of collection, detection and <b>alert</b> <b>modules</b> that are handled by local agents. The collection, detection and <b>alert</b> <b>modules</b> are uniquely enabled with the main operations of ad-hoc networking, which are found at the OSI link and network layers. The proposed modules are based on interpolating polynomials and linear threshold schemes. An experimental evaluation of these modules shows their efficiency for several attack scenarios, such as route logic compromise, traffic patterns distortion and denial of service attacks...|$|R
40|$|The Shark Alert Early Warning System is {{a device}} geared toward avid beach goers such as surfers, divers, and swimmers. The system is {{composed}} of an ultrasonic transmitter mounted on a shark’s dorsal fin and a receiver worn by the user around the ankle. The receiver alerts the user {{to the presence of}} a shark upon ultrasonic signal detection. The receiver warns the user through both visual and tactile (vibration) alerts to ensure user notification. This circuit was built and tested in the EE labs and Recreation Center pools to determine transmission range. The receiver detects the transmitted signal up to 150 feet away and fits comfortably on the user’s ankle. The <b>alert</b> <b>module</b> determines receiver detection. The transmitter remains operational over the shark’s lifetime by hydraulic turbine-based AC power generation. This is accomplished by utilizing the shark’s movement through the water. Testing was conducted in the Cal Poly Civil Engineering Department’s Flume and in Lake Nacimiento...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new defense approach based on risk balance to protect network servers from intrusion activities. We construct {{and implement a}} risk balance system, which consists of three modules, including a comprehensive <b>alert</b> processing <b>module,</b> an online risk assessment module, and a risk balance response decision-making <b>module.</b> The <b>alert</b> processing <b>module</b> improves the information quality of intrusion detection system (IDS) raw alerts by reducing false alerts rate, forming alert threads, and computing general parameters from the alert threads. The risk assessment module provides accurate evaluation of risks accordingly to alert threads. Based on the risk assessment, the response decision-making module is able to make right response decisions and perform very well in terms of noise immunization. Having advantages over conventional intrusion response systems, the risk balancer protects network servers not by directly blocking intrusion activities but by redirecting related network traffics and changing service platform. In this way, the system configurations that favor attackers are changed, and attacks are stopped with little impact on services to users. Therefore, the proposed risk balance approach is a good solution to not only the trade-off between the effectiveness and {{the negative effects of}} responses but also the false response problems caused by both IDS false-positive alerts and duplicated alerts...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{develop and}} apply formal {{ontology}} creation methods to {{the domain of}} antimicrobial prescribing and to formally evaluate the resulting ontology through intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation studies. MethodsWe extended existing ontology development methods to create the ontology and implemented the ontology using Protégé-OWL. Correctness of the ontology was assessed using a set of ontology design principles and domain expert review via the laddering technique. We created three artifacts to support the extrinsic evaluation (set of prescribing rules, alerts and an ontology-driven <b>alert</b> <b>module,</b> and a patient database) and evaluated {{the usefulness of the}} ontology for performing knowledge management tasks to maintain the ontology and for generating alerts to guide antibiotic prescribing. ResultsThe ontology includes 199 classes, 10 properties, and 1636 description logic restrictions. Twenty-three Semantic Web Rule Language rules were written to generate three prescribing alerts: (1) antibiotic-microorganism mismatch alert; (2) medication-allergy alert; and (3) non-recommended empiric antibiotic therapy alert. The evaluation studies confirmed the correctness of the ontology, usefulness of the ontology for representing and maintaining antimicrobial treatment knowledge rules, and usefulness of the ontology for generating alerts to provide feedback to clinicians during antibiotic prescribing. ConclusionsThis study contributes to the understanding of ontology development and evaluation methods and addresses one knowledge gap related to using ontologies as a clinical decision support system component—a need for formal ontology evaluation methods to measure their quality from the perspective of their intrinsic characteristics and their usefulness for specific tasks...|$|R

40|$|Management {{of complex}} chronic {{diseases}} such as diabetes requires the assimilation and interpretation of multiple laboratory test results. Traditional electronic health records tend to display laboratory results in a piecemeal and segregated fashion. This makes the assembly and interpretation of results related to diabetes care challenging. We developed a diabetes-specific {{clinical decision support system}} (Diabetes Dashboard) interface for displaying glycemic, lipid and renal function results, in an integrated form with decision support capabilities, based on local clinical practice guidelines. The clinical decision support system included a dashboard feature that graphically summarized all relevant laboratory results and displayed them in a color-coded system that allowed quick interpretation of the metabolic control of the patients. An <b>alert</b> <b>module</b> informs the user of tests that are due for repeat testing. An interactive graph module was also developed for better visual appreciation of the trends of the laboratory results of the patient. In a pilot study involving case scenarios administered via an electronic questionnaire, the Diabetes Dashboard, compared to the existing laboratory reporting interface, significantly improved the identification of abnormal laboratory results, of the long-term trend of the laboratory tests and of tests due for repeat testing. However, the Diabetes Dashboard did not significantly improve the identification of patients requiring treatment adjustment or {{the amount of time spent}} on each case scenario. In conclusion, we have developed and shown that the use of the Diabetes Dashboard, which incorporates several decision support features, can improve the management of diabetes. It is anticipated that this dashboard will be most helpful when deployed in an outpatient setting, where physicians can quickly make clinical decisions based on summarized information and be alerted to pertinent areas of care that require additional attention...|$|R
40|$|The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is an industrial-driven {{technology}} that monitors the network infrastructure {{of an organization}} from malicious intent. Although the IDS technology has advanced tremendously, {{one of the main}} issues that still remains since its beginning is the huge amount of attack alerts that have to be processed immediately on a daily basis. To manage these alerts effectively, both techniques of data reduction and correlation have to be applied concurrently. Therefore, this research proposes a framework named Intelligent Alert Processing Framework (lAPF) that incorporates both techniques named <b>Alert</b> Reduction <b>Module</b> (ARM) and <b>Alert</b> Correlation <b>Module</b> (ACM) to produce an integrated result. The ARM consists of a new clustering algorithm inspired by the Artificial Immune System (AIS) approach which is the Clonal Selection principle, while the ACM is based on pattern recognition approach. The new clustering algorithm introduces a one-to-one clustering method that first and foremost creates cluster based on a perfect matching criterion and next calculates its vulnerability level. Clusters with 0 vulnerability level will be filtered while other clusters will than proceed to ACM for attack scenario formulation and its successful attack scenario probability. The IAPF was successfully experimented using a standard simulated dataset and a real-time dataset from PRISMA (Pemantauan Rangkaian ICT Sektor Awam). The result of the experiment indicated that ARM achieved accurate clustering output, with zero cluster error within an average of 6. 36 seconds processing time and the reduction rate of alerts attained is 95. 34 %. Meanwhile ACM managed to detect all possible attack scenarios based on the predefined patterns. The proposed framework has reduced the number of alerts, creates attack scenarios and simultaneously produced vulnerability level for each clusters and the correlated successful attack scenario probabilit...|$|R
40|$|Alert {{management}} plays {{a critical}} role in many application domains including homeland security and natural disaster management, to allow timely and well-informed decisions. The major challenge faced by these systems is that the number of incoming alarms is overwhelming and some of the alarms are false positives. In this paper, we present an alert management system (AMS) that generates meaningful alerts from alarms received from different sensors. The <b>alert</b> generation <b>module</b> of our system (i) flags and eliminates potential false positives by characterizing the region into uniformly behaving neighborhoods, (ii) generates aggregated alerts from the alarms by employing density based clustering techniques and identifying the overlap among clusters, and (iii) identifies the dynamic flow of the alerts by integrating scientific models that characterize the behavior of sensor parameters. Once the alerts are generated our customized dissemination <b>module</b> disperses the <b>alerts</b> on the need-to-know basis to the individuals and agencies involved. This module adheres to the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and the National Response plan (NRP) protocols. To implement these protocols, we utilize the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP), which is an XML nonproprietary data interchange format. Finally, our GIS <b>module</b> displays the <b>alerts</b> through a user-friendly interface. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a distributed wireless {{intrusion detection system}} (IDS) based on Intelligent agents. Intelligent agents are randomly traveled in difference nodes which are connected with the network. Each agent may perform specific tests (like mobile sensors). When the test indicates some possibility of an intrusion, the agent may ask for additional tests at the site. Only after the suspicion level has been raised too high, it triggers alarm to the security officer. Notice that the attack is confirmed by executing only relevant tests and the entire suite of tests {{does not have to}} remain resident at every node. The agents are traveled by means of random sampling method. The mobile agents themselves can also have statistical properties such as rate at which they test nodes, their size, the diversity of nodes visited etc., The proposed model comprises of four major components: Intrusion detection <b>module,</b> <b>Alert,</b> Mobile agent platform, Test suit.

40|$|The Department of Engineering Cybernetics at the Norwegian University of Science andTechnology {{established}} the Unmanned Vehicle Laboratory fall 2010. The {{goal is to}} havestudents develop a fully functional autonomous aerial vehicle over time as part of projects and master s theses. A range of projects were carried out fall 2010, among others the report General Platform for Unmanned Autonomous Systems was written {{on the topic of}} hardware, operating systems and peripheral interfacing. This master s thesis continues where the previous report left suggestions for further work, and covers the topics of a software framework, sensor error detection, actuator and sensor interfacing, that is now part of the autonomous flight system. A highly modular software framework has been constructed, applicable far beyond theunmanned vehicle domain. Due to the high level of encapsulation and modularity it isespecially valuable in projects where there is a high mobility of the workforce, such as student projects and theses. It acts as a middleware layer, with language independent, separately compilable modules, communicating with one another to achieve the desired functionality. To prevent unrealistic or erroneous sensor readings from spreading through the system, a software detection unit catches signal anomalies based on statistics and <b>alerts</b> subscribing <b>modules.</b> The algorithm has been interfaced into the software framework, and is applicable to numerous sensors. Hardware was designed, constructed and tested to handle sensor interfacing, power supply demands and real-time critical actions such as actuator control. The design is performed from an aerial vehicle application point of view, but general {{to such an extent that}} is usable in a wide range of autonomous crafts. The framework, filter and hardware are merged together and tested on an embedded system, verifying the system functionality with a feedback loop from measurements to actuators. Utilizing the previous work along with all three elements of this thesis, a fully functional system for vehicle control is achieved...|$|R
40|$|Traditional network {{architecture}} is inflexible and complicated. This observation {{has led to}} a paradigm shift towards software-defined networking (SDN), where network management level is separated from data forwarding level. This change was made possible by control plane transfer from the switching equipment to software modules that run on a dedicated server, called the controller (or network operating system), or network applications, that work with this controller. Methods of representation, storage and communication interfaces with network topology elements are the most important aspects of network operating systems available to SDN user because performance of some key controller modules is heavily dependent on internal representation of the network topology. Notably, firewall and routing modules are examples of such modules. This article describes the methods used for presentation and storage of network topologies, as well as interface to the corresponding Floodlight modules. An alternative algorithm has been suggested and developed for message exchange conveying network topology alterations between the controller and network applications. Proposed algorithm makes implementation of <b>module</b> <b>alerting</b> based on subscription to the relevant events. API for interaction between controller and network applications has been developed. This algorithm and API formed the base for Topology Tracker module capable to inform network applications about the changes that had occurred in the network topology and also stores compact representation of the network to speed up the interaction process...|$|R
40|$|The {{optimization}} of {{the extension}} of the timelife of the torches without hazard of drop of the product is an unceasing industrial difficulty. It needs a reliable criterion to characterize the wear, and thus indicate when the nozzle used should be switched by a new nozzle. These criteria are still quite subjective and hold the operator's experience. In 2003, David RIGOT, in collaboration with the Volvo Aero Corporation, has defined a number of criteria in his thesis dissertation [1]. This study led to the realization of an electronic <b>module</b> <b>alert</b> detecting the hazardous time of process. The focus method was based on research and tracking characteristic frequencies in arc voltage fluctuations and in acoustic noise that is the image. It seems that a rough statistical study of signals is able to help define and visualize simple criteria ruthless variation is usable in objective phenomena wear alert. This is ad hoc measures for smooth power spectrum [2] [3] and its variability. Filtered signal is used to distinguish typically one or two epochs of slow wear followed by an epoch of fast wear. This difference is clear after a suitable choice of used frequency bands. Graphical representations are very expressive; they are supplemented by statistical tests.

Some women find themselves at a greater risk for becoming the victim of either serious assault or murder, {{but it is more}} about a feeling of dominance from one person over another. Even though women are targeted, the overall point is that their needless victimization could have been prevented. Even women who perform the necessary steps to stay alive—such as getting a restraining order, hiding, and filing criminal charges—still end up dead. Therefore, avoiding any violent attack is better that attempting to survive one. Self defence and alert system for individuals is avoid these crimes in alone or being in badly lit areas also.

40|$|Eastern Sicily in Italy is {{well-known}} {{as a high}} seismic and volcanic risk area. From a monitoring point of view, a team/unit of people has been created (UFSO) {{with the task of}} managing all the activities connected to the faultless operation of the Working Room that is the strategic centre during periods of routine operations {{or in the case of}} emergency. Among the primary activities of monitoring and surveillance, the management of the video camera network located on the main Sicilian active volcanoes represents a major goal. This task is achieved by means of permanent, visible and infrared cameras together with similar mobile systems, in order to observe each phenomenon related to the volcanic activity. The expert staff can therefore make decisions, in real time, from useful information in order to understand the phenomena in action. With the aim of maximizing the results and performance of all the networks, the UFSO is attentive to the planning and realization of hardware and software systems that are always available in the mobile van unit. In this context, the staff actively participates in national and European research projects dealing with the development and use of new systems with high technological content. Another aspect of the work, moreover, is represented by the development of supervisory control software, namely software providing automatic control of the working systems.
