50|$|The flight {{instrumentation}} system {{is composed of}} a primary instrumentation <b>package</b> and an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>package.</b> The primary package instrumentation measures those parameters critical to all engine static firings and subsequent vehicle launches. These include some 70 parameters such as pressures, temperatures, flows, speeds, and valve positions for the engine components, with the capability of transmitting signals to a ground recording system or a telemetry system, or both. The {{instrumentation system}} is designed for use throughout {{the life of the}} engine, from the first static acceptance firing to its ultimate vehicle flight. The <b>auxiliary</b> <b>package</b> is designed for use during early vehicle flights. It may be deleted from the basic engine instrumentation system after the propulsion system has established its reliability during research and development vehicle flights. It contains sufficient flexibility to provide for deletion, substitution, or addition of parameters deemed necessary as a result of additional testing. Eventual deletion of the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>package</b> will not interfere with the measurement capability of the primary package.|$|R

40|$|A {{low output}} {{ripple and noise}} {{converter}} is achieved by employing a zero-voltage switch (ZVS), an integrated magnetics structure which couples a transformer and several coupled inductors in one core, and several <b>auxiliary</b> <b>packaging</b> designs. In the steady-state analysis, the operation of ZVS converter is described and the ZVS switch resonant component design procedure is developed. An optimized geometrical core constant integrated magnetics design procedure is proposed. Some <b>auxiliary</b> <b>packaging</b> design considerations are addressed. The converter ac analysis {{is divided into two}} parts to observe the individual small signal effect introduced by the ZVS switch and coupled inductor. The uncoupled-inductor converter ac analysis is conducted by a new approach: an extended circuit averaging method. The converter ac model is obtained by substituting in the coupled inductor ac model to the uncoupled-inductor converter ac model. It is found both the dc coupled inductor zero current ripple condition and the ac converter transfer function response are affected by the turns ratio and the leakage inductance of the coupled inductor. Hence, the converter dc and ac designs are coupled by the coupled inductor operation. Experimental results of the dc and ac analysis of a ZVS converter with coupled inductor are shown. Integrated magnetics achieves less than 3 % peak-to-peak current ripple on both coupled inductors at the same time. The equivalent result by separate magnetics approach requires twice the volume implemented by the integrated magnetics structure...|$|R
