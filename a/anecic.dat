40|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, earthworms {{are often}} observed to burrow through compacted soil layers, {{leading to the}} general assumption that these animals {{play a significant role}} in regenerating compacted soils in agricultural plots. To demonstrate this role under field conditions, the abundance of earthworm macropores inside compacted zones was estimated on plots under reduced (RT) or conventional tillage (CT). Then, different types of compacted zones typically found in CT (plough pan and compacted clods) and RT plots (compacted volume under wheel tracks) were experimentally simulated in wooden boxes, buried in the field and inoculated with different earthworm species. After 6 weeks of incubation, the number of macropores inside the compacted zones was examined. Field observations showed that approximately 10 % and 30 % of the compacted zones were colonised by at least one macropore in CT and RT plots, respectively. A significantly greater number of <b>anecics</b> was found in RT plots, but we could not conclude that this ecological type of earthworm plays a more major role in the regeneration process in these plots since there were fewer compacted zones and these covered a smaller area in CT. The semi-field experiment provided evidence that earthworm-mediated regeneration of compacted zones is possible and its nature varies between ecological types of earthworm. Lumbricus terrestris, which makes individual burrows that are vertical and deep, was the main species to cross through the plough pan. The other three earthworm species (Aporrectodea giardi, A. caliginosa and A. rosea) did burrow inside the other types of compacted zones (“wheel tracks” and “compacted clods”). In every case, however, macropore density was far greater in non-compacted zones, illustrating that avoidance of compacted soil by earthworms is important and should be taken into account when extrapolating results from laboratory studies...|$|R

The red compost worms, such as the well known red wiggler or the European nightcrawler, are better candidates, as they are epigeic, or surface dwellers.

Mature endogeic (Allolobophora caliginosa), mature epigeic (Lumbricus rubellus), and semimature <b>anecic</b> worms (A. longa) were collected in September 2002 from a woodland site at Lancaster, UK. Because <b>anecic</b> worms {{are known to have}} a variable feeding behaviour and can show dietary changes during ontogeny, additional immature and mature specimens of A. longa were also collected from the same site in January 2004.

40|$|Earthworms are {{recognised}} widely {{for playing}} {{important roles in}} soil functioning, but few studies have attempted to assess the effects of separate functional groups under natural field conditions. We investigated the effects of selective removal of large <b>anecic</b> earthworms (primarily Lumbricus terrestris) over 18 months on earthworm assemblages, earthworm trophic ecology, and plant nutrient uptake in a temperate grassland. We used unenclosed field plots to simulate selective predation of large <b>anecic</b> individuals by alien flatworms and isotopically enriched plant material (13 C and 15 N) to trace nutrients. Though surface addition of plant material to plots increased the abundance and biomass of total and <b>anecic</b> earthworms, compared to control plots, earthworm composition was different and more variable where anecics had been removed. Most notably, in treatments receiving litter, abundance and biomass of the litter-feeding epi-anecic Lumbricus festivus and epigeic Satchellius mammalis were significantly greater where anecics had been removed. Addition of labelled plant material enriched individuals from all species in 13 C and 15 N, especially in litter-feeding epigeics. Similar abundances but altered isotopic compositions suggest that the removal of anecics influenced the feeding activities of other earthworm species. In particular, the soil-feeding endogeic Aporrectodea caliginosa was less enriched where anecics had been removed, suggesting that this species benefits from <b>anecic</b> surface foraging activity. Individual L. terrestris tended to be less enriched isotopically in the removal treatment, probably reflecting re-colonisation from outside litter addition plots. There was no effect of <b>anecic</b> removal on 15 N uptake into above-ground biomass of each of three plant functional groups, {{though there was a}} trend of greater enrichment in removal plots. Taken together, these findings provide novel evidence, from a real field setting, that low-level reduction of <b>anecic</b> earthworm populations (experimental removal of 4 large individuals per 1 m 2 plot over 18 months) can affect other earthworm species in terms of their abundance and trophic relations...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{diversity}} and ecology of earthworms in floodplains, as well as their response to natural and anthropic perturbations (e. g. floods, river channelisation, floodplain restoration). We characterised the patterns of earthworm communities and species traits in the different habitats of a lowland restored floodplain in Switzerland. In addition to classical species-based metrics, such as species richness and Shannon diversity, species traits were used to calculate the community weighted means (CWMs) of traits and functional dispersion (FDis). We hypothesised that trait-based metrics would reveal clearer patterns than classical approaches. The distribution of earthworm traits varied among habitats in relation to changes in flooding frequency: poorly developed gravel bar soils most exposed to flooding were characterised by high abundance of small epigeic species and low abundance of large <b>anecic</b> species. Differences in <b>anecic</b> and endogeic earthworm community structure matched flood frequency.

40|$|Ecological {{functions}} of earthworms in soil Walter S. Andriuzzi Abstract Earthworms {{are known to}} play an important role in soil structure and fertility, but there are still big knowledge gaps on the functional ecology of distinct earthworm species, on their own and in interaction with other species. This thesis investigated how earthworms affect soil biochemical and biophysical functioning, and other organisms such as plants and smaller soil organisms. Two field experiments with stable isotope tracers were performed to investigate how <b>anecic</b> earthworms (which feed on organic matter at the soil surface and dig deep burrows) transfer carbon and nitrogen from fresh plant litter into soil, and how this in turn affects soil organic matter composition, protists and nematodes. Another field experiment tested whether the <b>anecic</b> earthworm Lumbricus terrestris can counteract negative effects of intense rainfall on soil and plants (ryegrass). A greenhouse experiment was carried out to study how co-occurring earthworm species – two <b>anecic</b> and one endogeic (smaller, soil-feeding) – affect transfer of nitrogen from dung to soil and plants, nitrogen retention in soil, and plant growth. For the latter experiment, a method to produce herbivore (rabbit) dung triple-labelled with carbon, nitrogen and sulphur stable isotopes was developed. Overall, the findings highlight important {{functions of}} earthworms in carbon and nitrogen cycling, soil biophysical structure maintenance due to burrow formation, and resulting biotic interactions. A novel finding was that the sphere of influence of <b>anecic</b> earthworms in soil (the ‘drilosphere’) is a much larger biochemical and biological hotspot than hitherto assumed. Rapid movement of carbon and nitrogen from surface to soil thanks to <b>anecic</b> earthworm activity resulted in spatial heterogeneity in soil carbon content, organic matter composition, and density of smaller eukaryotes (e. g. bacterial-feeding protists). Evidence was found that distinct earthworm <b>anecic</b> species may have dissimilar effects on soil biochemistry and plant growth, and that both <b>anecic</b> and endogeic earthworms may feed on surface organic matter (dung). This shows that the validity of earthworm ecological groups depends on the function under study, and suggests that, for some research questions, species identity should not be neglected; other approaches to quantify ecological differences between species (e. g. functional traits) are appraised. Finally, L. terrestris was found to ameliorate the disturbance of intense rain on plants, giving evidence to the idea that some components of soil biodiversity may contribute to ecosystem stability in the face of disturbance.                          ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDispersal {{capacities}} can strongly determine an individual's {{ability to}} respond to changing environmental conditions, which would consequently influence the structure of natural communities. Nonetheless, we know little about the dispersal behaviour of soil organisms, despite some of these organisms, such as earthworms, have key roles in ecosystem functioning (e. g. organic matter decomposition). We expect that species exposed to frequent environmental changes would benefit from the capacity to escape from adverse environmental conditions and to disperse to settle in a more suitable habitat. In earthworms, we expect the epigeic group, which lives at or close to the soil surface, to have evolved higher dispersal capacities than the two other functional groups – <b>anecic</b> and endogeic, which live deeper in the soil. In this study, we investigated dispersal and diffusion behaviour of three species of epigeic earthworms (i. e. Eisenia fetida, Eisenia andrei and Lumbricus rubellus) and compared these behaviours with those of <b>anecic</b> and endogeic earthworms, whose behaviour has been previously measured through similar experiments. In accordance with our hypothesis, our study shows that dispersal behaviour of epigeic earthworms depends on habitat quality and population density, but that those responses vary among species and that it differs only to a limited extent from behaviour of <b>anecic</b> and endogeic earthworms...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDispersal plays a {{key role}} in the {{dynamics}} of ecological communities as it strongly determines the potential of individuals to colonize new habitats. Understanding and predicting species dispersal behaviour is therefore central to any effort at managing or even understanding the formation of communities. In this context, it is essential to understand the influence of environmental and biotic determinants of dispersal. In this work, we assessed these questions using earthworms as model organisms. We assessed the dispersal behaviour of six earthworm species belonging to two different functional groups (i. e. three anecics and three endogeics) in response to three key environmental factors: habitat quality, intraspecific density, and environment homogeneity. We found that habitat quality significantly influenced the dispersal rates of all species. Intraspecific density increased the dispersal rate of the three <b>anecic</b> species but only of one endogeic species. In a homogeneous environment, anecics dispersed further and in greater proportion than the majority of endogeics. Moreover, few <b>anecic</b> species have shown a tendency to follow conspecifics. Overall, <b>anecic</b> species seemed to have a higher active dispersal inclination than most endogeic ones. We found a high variability of our results within each functional groups, which suggests that this classification cannot be used to explain or predict the dispersal behaviour of earthworms...|$|E

Different patterns of vertical stratification were observed for all species with a strong migration of populations to deeper layers in the dry season. The correlation between the size of the earthworms and the average depth at which they were found was not significant (P> 0. 05), despite the fact that bigger species are located deeper in the soil. The living habits and adaptive strategies of the smallest species, Ocnerodrilidae n. sp., found in both ecosystems studied are responsible for this pattern. This endogeic species is associated with organic pools generated by an <b>anecic</b> species and further studies should assess the role of this species in ecosystem functioning.

A simple water infiltration test, the Beerkan method, was also used to assess some functional properties of these burrow systems. Endogeic worms make larger burrow systems, which are more highly branched, less continuous and of smaller diameter, than those of <b>anecic</b> worms. Among the <b>anecic</b> species, L. terrestris burrow systems are shorter (9. 2 vs 21. 2 m) with a higher number (14. 5 vs 23. 5) of less branched burrows (12. 2 vs 20. 2 branches m(- 1)), which are also wider (7. 78 vs 5. 16 mm) than those of A. nocturna. In comparison, the burrow systems made by endogeic species appeared similar to each other. However, A. rosea burrows were short and narrow, whereas A. icterica had a longer burrow system (15. 7 m), more intense bioturbation intensity (refilled macropores or soil lateral compaction around them) and thus {{a greater number of}} burrows. Regarding water infiltration, <b>anecic</b> burrow systems were far more efficient due to open burrows linking {{the top and bottom of}} the cores. For endogeic species, we observed a linear relationship between burrow length and the water infiltration rate (R (2) = 0. 49, p < 0. 01).

The replacement of native litter by litter with a better quality resulted in a faster litter decomposition. However, maximal decay rates were obtained only when litter manipulation, earthworm inoculation and liming were combined. <b>Anecic</b> earthworms were initially absent as soils were probably too acid. Liming as well as litter manipulation had a small positive influence on the numbers of retraced L. terrestris, inducing positive feedback mechanisms on soil pH and litter decomposition rates. None of the treatments, however, had a significant effect on the compaction degrees within or beside tracks within the small study period. L. terrestris realized only a small decrease of bulk density beside the tracks. Within the tracks a similar number of L. terrestris was retrieved, but effects on the compaction degree were negligible. Liming decreased penetration resistance, but only in the absence of <b>anecic</b> earthworms. Endogeic earthworms were overall more abundant than the anecics, especially within tracks where soil water contents and pH values were higher. However, endogeics only had a marginal effect on litter decomposition and although they positively influence soil structure, they could not realize a reduction of the compaction degree, quantified by bulk density and penetration resistance, due to different burrowing habits. Our results indicated that a positive impact of <b>anecic</b> earthworms on the structure of compacted forest soils can be obtained in the long-term, at least in case soil conditions (acidity, nutrient availability and moisture content) are favourable.

We used plant material labelled with stable isotope tracers to detect fresh C input around earthworm-occupied burrows or around burrows from which the earthworm had been removed. After 50  days, we sampled soil (0 [...] 10  cm depth) in concentric layers around the burrows, distinguishing between drilosphere (0 [...] 8  mm) and bulk soil (50 [...] 75  mm).

Earthworms also shifted the spatial distribution of soil C towards the drilosphere. The total abundance of protists and nematodes was only slightly higher in earthworm-occupied drilosphere, but strong positive effects were found for some protist clades (e. g. Stenamoeba spp.).

In P. annua and V. persica A. caliginosa and L. terrestris also affected the shoot/root ratio and this effect depended on soil type. Finally, few significant interactions were found between the <b>anecic</b> and the endogeic earthworms and these interactions did not depend on the soil type. A general idea would be that earthworms mostly increase plant growth through the enhancement of mineralization and that earthworm effects should decrease in nutrient-rich soils or with mineral fertilization. However, our results show that this view does not hold and that other mechanisms are influential. Keywords Earthworms. L. terrestris. A. caliginosa. Plant growth. Soil type. Nutrient availability.

40|$|Earthworms are an {{invasive}} {{species that are}} causing ecological damage to northern forest ecosystems. The disruption to soil nutrient cycling and litter decomposition can negatively impact organisms that live within the leaf litter, such as salamanders. To test this hypothesis, we sampled earthworms within three ravines at thirty-six sites using the mustard extraction method. We surveyed salamander populations on two dates in 2015 at each site using cover boards. We also collected data on slope aspect, altitude, soil moisture, leaf litter coverage, canopy cover, and coarse woody debris at each site to determine their effects on earthworm and salamander populations. Unexpectedly, our results show that total earthworm populations did not decrease salamander abundance. However, epigeic earthworms in north facing, low elevation sites did {{have a negative effect}} on salamanders. We also found that <b>anecic</b> earthworm species had a negative impact on leaf litter in south facing, low elevation sites. Using a GLIMMIX model, we found that epigeic earthworms had a negative effect on salamander populations, while <b>anecic</b> earthworms had a positive effect on salamander populations...|$|E
40|$|Summary—The humus forms {{during the}} life cycle of a spruce forest are described. A {{significant}} change in humus form may be attributed to plant and soil fauna changes. This phenomenon is considered to be fundamental for the renewal of the forest ecosystem. Forest dynamics is perceived as a biphasic cycle, (i) the tree growth phase with a shift from mull towards moder humus form, as a consequence of a decline in earthworm populations and (ii) a humus form improvement from moder towards earthworm mull humus, {{during the second half of}} the life of spruce trees. This results from a succession of earthworm species. The particular role of <b>anecic</b> species during the second phase has been highlighted, where they allow endogeic earthworm species and young spruce seedlings to install themselves in the regeneration site, the fall of parent trees not being considered as the chief factor governing humus changes. The life cycle of the spruce ecosystem can nevertheless be impaired by the development of a bilberry heath, with a mor humus form which is detrimental to the germination and growth of spruce seedlings. Earthworm populations of <b>anecic</b> and endogeic species are present in this case but without any burrowing activity...|$|E
40|$|Earthworms {{strongly}} affect soil {{organic carbon}} cycling. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine whether deep burrowing <b>anecic</b> earthworms enhance carbon storage in soils and decrease C turnover. Earthworm burrow linings were separated into thin cylindrical sections with different distances from the burrow wall to determine gradients from the burrow wall to the surrounding soil. Organic C, total N, radiocarbon (C- 14) concentration, stable isotope values (delta C- 13, delta N- 15) and extracellular enzyme activities were measured in these samples. <b>Anecic</b> earthworms increased C stocks by 270 and 310 g m(- 2) accumulated in the vertical burrows. C-enrichment of the burrow linings was spatially highly variable within a distance of millimetres around the burrow walls. It was shown that C accumulation in burrows can be fast with C sequestration rates of about 22 g C m(- 2) yr(- 1) in the burrow linings, but accumulated C in the burrows may be mineralised fast with turnover times of only 3 - 5 years. Carbon stocks in earthworm burrows strongly depended on the earthworm activity which maintains continuous C input into the burrows. The enhanced extracellular enzyme activity of fresh casts was not persistent, but was 47 % lower in inhabited burrows and 62 % lower in abandoned burrows. Enzyme activities followed the C concentrations in the burrows and were not further suppressed due to earthworms. Radiocarbon concentrations and stable isotopes in the burrow linings showed an exponential gradient with the youngest and less degraded organic matter in the innermost part of the burrow wall. Carbon accumulation by <b>anecic</b> earthworm is restricted to distinct burrows with less influence to the surrounding soil. Contrary to the initial hypothesis, that organic C is stabilised due to earthworms, relaxation time experiments with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) did not reveal any enhanced adsorption of C on iron oxides with C stabilising effect. Our results suggest that earthworm activity does not substantially increase subsoil C stocks but burrows serve as fast ways for fresh C transport into deep soil horizons. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|<b>Anecic</b> (deep-burrowing) {{earthworms}} {{are important}} for soil biogeochemical functioning, but the fine-scale spatial range at which they incorporate C and N around their burrows (the drilosphere sensu stricto) needs to be investigated under realistic conditions. We conducted a field experiment to delimit spatially {{the extent to which}} soil around natural Lumbricus terrestris burrows is influenced biochemically. We placed plant litter dual-labelled with C- 13 and N- 15 stable isotope tracers on L terrestris burrow openings and we measured residue-derived C- 13 and N- 15 in thin concentric layers (0 - 2, 2 - 4, 4 - 8 mm) around burrows with or without a resident earthworm. After 45 days, earthworms were significantly enriched in C- 13 and N- 15 as a result of feeding on the plant litter. At 0 - 5 cm soil depth, soil N- 15 concentrations were significantly higher around occupied than unoccupied burrows, and they were significantly higher in all burrow layers (including 4 - 8 mm) than in bulk soil (50 - 75 mm from burrow). This suggests that biochemical drilosphere effects of <b>anecic</b> earthworms, at least in the uppermost portion of the burrow, extend farther than the 2 mm layer assumed traditionally.
