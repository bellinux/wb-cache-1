5|$|As {{the first}} groups of his partisans fleeing the capital arrived at Demotika, Kantakouzenos, {{by his own}} account, tried to {{negotiate}} with the new regency, but his approach was rebuffed. Finally forced to take decisive action, on 26 October 1341, the army (2,000 cavalry and 4,000 infantry, according to Gregoras) and his supporters, largely drawn from the land-holding aristocracy, proclaimed Kantakouzenos Emperor. Although he still presented himself officially as a junior colleague to John V, and claimed to be only acting in the boy's name, having staked his claim on the throne, he had effectively started a civil war. Kantakouzenos still hoped that negotiation might resolve the situation, but all his envoys were imprisoned <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his supporters excommunicated by Patriarch John XIV.

5|$|Basil II accorded Mansur the fief of Shih al-Laylun (Loulon) {{near the}} Byzantine–Arab frontier. According to {{historian}} Jean-Claude Cheynet, this fief {{could not have}} been the frontier fortress of Loulon, but rather a group of villages from which Mansur received his income during his asylum in Antioch. Mansur later built a fortress in his fief. Basil II also granted Mansur a building in Antioch itself. Mansur received a salary <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his men served in the Byzantine army of Antioch, where he commanded a tagma (professional regiment) of 700 men. He was in the entourage of Emperor Romanos III at the Battle of Azaz in 1030, which was fought against Salih's son and successor, Shibl al-Dawla Nasr. Mansur's presence likely indicates Romanos's intention to restore Mansur to Aleppo, according to Zakkar, though the attempt ended in a decisive Byzantine defeat.|$|E

Beauregard believed that the battle was essentially won and his men could finish off Grant in the morning. He knew the terrain to be crossed (a steep ravine containing a creek named Dill Branch) was extremely difficult and Grant's defensive line was heavy with massed artillery and supported by gunboats in the river. Unbeknownst to Beauregard, Buell's Army of the Ohio began arriving that afternoon, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Grant launched a massive counterattack on April 7. Overwhelmed, the Confederates retreated to Corinth.|$|E

Injuries continued to take their toll upon Robson during the 1992–93 season, leading to Bruce captaining the team in the majority of United's matches during the first season of the new Premier League.
