5|$|Husbandry, {{especially}} if it is intensive, has a substantial environmental impact, occupying {{about a third of}} the earth's ice-free land, causing loss of habitat and emitting <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> greenhouse gas worldwide. Since the 18th century, people have become increasingly concerned about the welfare of farm animals, and laws and standards are widely enforced in response. In culture, animal husbandry often has an idyllic image, featuring in children's books and songs, where happy animals live in attractive countryside. A similar image may be projected by petting farms and by historic farms that offer farmstays to paying visitors.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{chlorine}} and bromine {{which have}} one significant main use dwarfing all others, iodine {{is used in}} many applications of varying importance. <b>About</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> produced iodine goes into various organoiodine compounds; another 15% remains as the pure element, another 15% is used to form potassium iodide, and another 15% for other inorganic iodine compounds. The remaining 5% is for minor uses. Among the major uses of iodine compounds are catalysts, animal feed supplements, stabilisers, dyes, colourants and pigments, pharmaceutical, sanitation (from tincture of iodine), and photography; minor uses include smog inhibition, cloud seeding, and various uses in analytical chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Boron is {{primarily}} used in chemical compounds. <b>About</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> boron consumed globally is an additive in fiberglass for insulation and structural materials. The next leading use is in polymers and ceramics in high-strength, lightweight structural and refractory materials. Borosilicate glass is desired for its greater strength and thermal shock resistance than ordinary soda lime glass. Boron compounds {{are used as}} fertilizers in agriculture and in sodium perborate bleaches. A small amount of boron {{is used as a}} dopant in semiconductors, and reagent intermediates in the synthesis of organic fine chemicals. A few boron-containing organic pharmaceuticals are used or are in study. Natural boron is composed of two stable isotopes, one of which (boron-10) has a number of uses as a neutron-capturing agent.|$|E

5|$|During {{the era of}} the {{collodion}} process, {{before the}} arrival of less demanding photographic technology (the gelatin silver process, photographic film, and smaller cameras) and the consequent rise of amateur photography, commercial photographers like Farsari had a particular importance for recording events and views. In Japan before 1899 such photographers were even more significant because the government required foreigners to obtain passes to journey to the interior, and commercial photographers based in Japan could more easily gain access and provide rare images of restricted areas. By 1889, however, Farsari estimated that <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> visitors to Yokohama were amateur photographers; even if this was an exaggeration, the presence of increasing numbers of amateur photographers was obviously affecting the commercial photography business. To encourage amateur photographers to visit his studio and possibly buy his merchandise, Farsari provided free use of a darkroom.|$|E

40|$|The {{administration}} of chemicals at the {{maximum tolerated dose}} (MTD) in standard animal cancer tests is postulated to increase cell division (mitogenesis), which in turn increases rates of mutagenesis and thus carcinogenesis. The animal data are consistent with this mechanism, because a high proportion [...] <b>about</b> <b>half</b> [...] <b>of</b> <b>all</b> chemicals tested (whether natural or synthetic) are indeed rodent carcinogens. We conclude that at the low doses of most human exposures, where cell killing does not occur, the hazards to humans of rodent carcinogens may be much lower than is commonly assumed...|$|R
5|$|U.S. {{taxation}} {{is generally}} progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and {{is among the}} most progressive in the developed world. The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> taxes. Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E
5|$|Environmental hazards {{induced by}} humans also puts {{sirenians}} at risk. Sirenians, especially the West Indian manatee, face high mortality from watercraft collision, and <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> West Indian manatee deaths {{are caused by}} watercraft collisions. An increased usage of hydroelectric power and subsequent damming of rivers increase waterway traffic, {{which can lead to}} vessel collisions, and manatees may become entangled in navigational locks. The urbanized coastline of areas such as the Caribbean and Australia can result in the decline of seagrass populations. Reliable areas of warm water in Florida are generally the result of discharge from power plants, but newer plants with more efficient cooling systems may disrupt the pattern of warm water refuges, and an increased demand for artesian springs for water, the natural source of warm water, decreases the number of warm water refuges. Sirenians can be caught as bycatch from fisheries, and they can be seen as pests with the interference of local fishermen and the destruction of their nets. African manatees have also been known to venture into rice paddies and destroy the crops during the rainy season, and these confrontations with locals may lead to intentional culling of the manatees.|$|E
5|$|Supernovae are {{the major}} source of {{elements}} heavier than nitrogen. These elements are produced by nuclear fusion for nuclei up to 34S, by silicon photodisintegration rearrangement and quasiequilibrium (see Supernova nucleosynthesis) during silicon burning for nuclei between 36Ar and 56Ni, and by rapid captures of neutrons during the supernova's collapse for elements heavier than iron. Nucleosynthesis during silicon burning yields nuclei roughly 1000-100,000 times more abundant than the r-process isotopes heavier than iron. Supernovae are the most likely, although not undisputed, candidate sites for the r-process, which is the rapid capture of neutrons that occurs at high temperature and high density of neutrons. Those reactions produce highly unstable nuclei that are rich in neutrons and that rapidly beta decay into more stable forms. The r-process produces <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the heavier isotopes of the elements beyond iron, including plutonium and uranium. The only other major competing process for producing elements heavier than iron is the s-process in large, old, red-giant AGB stars, which produces these elements slowly over longer epochs and which cannot produce elements heavier than lead.|$|E

25|$|According to Gillberg, {{clinically}} severe form DAMP (or ADHD+DCD) affects about 1.5% of {{the general}} population of school age children; another few per cent are affected by more moderate variants.

There is a strong link with autism spectrum disorders in severe DAMP. Familial factors and pre- and perinatal risk factors account for much of the variance. Psychosocial risk factors appear to increase the risk of marked psychiatric abnormality in DAMP.
