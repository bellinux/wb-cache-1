The values of such equation are calculated on the data base for the long time series. Last half of century is observed a change of different climatic characteristics, in particularity precipitations, which are an element of water balance and has very significant influence on runoff to water reservoir. Consequently there is need to simulate precipitation according to last time of series which has more short duration but more reality. However we must take to consideration a big amount of different scenarios of precipitation both for annual values and for the internal year intervals. Accordingly main purpose of the scientific work is the checking of the method for simulation <b>artificial</b> rows of <b>precipitation</b> according to climatic changes.

The ageing precipitation and strengthening {{behavior of the}} spray formed Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy were studied by microhardness tests, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The {{results show that the}} main strengthening precipitates of the spray formed Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloy are GPI (solute-rich clusters), GPII (vacancy-rich clusters) under peak aging condition. The effect of the microstructure on ageing hardness is controlled by the size and amount of the existing precipitates, and therefore depends critically on the ageing temperature and ageing time. Strength of this alloy is influenced significantly during natural ageing at room temperature, which is related to the dominant formation of GPI. During the initial stage of artificial ageing at 120 ℃, strong age-strengthening response is due to the formation of GP zones (both GPI and GPII).

40|$|Estimating spatial {{distribution}} of precipitation is vital to execute water resources plans, drought, land-use plans; environment, watershed management, and agricultural master plans. High variation in amount of precipitation in various parts, lack of measurement stations, and the complexity of relationship between precipitation and parameters affecting it have doubled the importance of developing efficient methods in estimating {{spatial distribution}} of <b>precipitation.</b> <b>Artificial</b> neural network has been proved to be efficient as a new way for modeling and predicting the processes for which no solution and explicit relationship has been available in accurately identifying and describing them. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the efficiency of artificial neural network in estimating spatial monthly precipitation. To achieve this objective, neural network with multilayer perceptorn topology was employed for preparing model for spatial monthly precipitation in five synoptic and rain-gauge stations located in Kurdistan province. In order to design the topology of the model in each station, as the adjustable parameters (including transfer function, learning rule, amount of momentum, number of hidden layers, number of neurons of the hidden layers, and the number of epochs) changed, different neural networks were made and carried out. In each case, the topology with the minimum amount of root mean square error (RMSE) was selected as the optimal model. Owing to the fact that the selection of each of the variable parameters of neural network necessitated recurring trails and errors, and consequently teaching a large number of networks with various topologies, genetic algorithm method was utilized for finding the optimization of these parameters; the efficiency of this method, too, was examined in terms of the optimization of neural network.

40|$|Whey {{protein isolate}} {{is used as}} a {{functional}} ingredient in acidic whey protein beverages, but the associated astringency is a big hurdle to introduce these beverages into the mainstream market. If we can solve the astringency issue, Fonterra would have big advantages over their competitors. Our hypothesis is that whey protein interacts with human saliva proteins and the subsequent precipitation causes astringency. In the present study, ion exchange whey protein isolates (WPI) 8855, and solutions of pure a-lac and ß-lg were used to determine which whey protein fractions are responsible for sedimentation in artificial or human saliva. It has been shown that sedimentation correlates to the level of astringency. Therefore only the level of sedimentation was investigated. The human saliva and artificial saliva were also compared in the astringency titration model in order to determine whether artificial saliva is representative of human saliva. Heat treatment (85 °C, 30 s) of whey protein solution was performed to mimic commercial beverage manufacture. The heated and non-heated whey protein solutions were titrated with artificial saliva, human saliva or sodium bicarbonate buffer in the range of pH 3 to 6. The sediment was recovered by centrifugation of the titrated samples, and analysed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) or one and two dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) with amido black and periodic acid Schiff stain. This study showed that ß-lg is the key sedimentation component in heated acidic WPI 8855 beverages due to the heat aggregation, pH change through the isoelectric point and interaction with human saliva proteins, including mucin, proline-rich proteins (PRPS) and a-amylase. BSA also interacted with artificial and human saliva, whereas a-lac did not interact with either artificial or human saliva. Heat treatment caused extensive whey protein aggregation and <b>precipitation.</b> <b>Artificial</b> saliva and human saliva behaved differently in this astringency titration model, therefore it is not recommended to use artificial saliva in an in vitro model to predict astringency in vivo.

40|$|Operation Framework In {{the arid}} climate of Southern and Central Utah, {{there is a}} {{continuing}} need to augment water supplies. While much of the water is needed for summertime use, particularly for irrigation, most of the available water is supplied by winter storms. Therefore, {{it is for the}} augmentation of the water stored naturally as snowpack at higher elevations that cloud seeding can make its greatest contribution. Over the past several years, an attempt has been made to augment the snowpack by cloud seeding. Although there is a physical basis for expecting an increase in precipitation from a scientifically managed cloud seeding program, the empirical evidence that such increases have actually resulted is inconclusive. If the desired increases have not been achieved, the most likely explanation is that the empirical data necessary to distinguish seeding opportunities adequately have not been collected and applied. Presently, it is worthwhile to design a cloud seeding program in which plans are made beforehand to obtain appropriate field data for use in the execution and evaluation of the program. Inasmuch as both the clouds available for seeding and the precipitation and storage of water in the form of snowpack are concentrated in the mountains, the area of precipitation augmentation is best confined also to the mountains. Even though the duration of the seeding program may be indefinite, the duration of operation to be evaluated should be defined in advance and carried out as planned. To do otherwise could introduce unwanted bias and doubtful conclusions. Although an improved operational project with an extensive evaluation included in the design costs much more than that of a simple cloud seeding effort, the benefits will undoubtedly justify the expenditure. The reason is twofold. In terms of immediate benefits, the program will improve determination of which clouds or storms are seedable and concentrate the seeding effort where it will be most beneficial. In the long run, a properly planned and executed evaluation will produce results that will enhance the long term stability of the seeding program as a while. Concerning the socio-economic impact of more effective cloud seeding, the benefits of an increased snowpack are likely to far exceed both the cost of benefits of an increased snowpack are likely to far exceed both the cost of the program and any occasional undesirable side effects. However, the disbenefits of the program should not be overlooked. Potential problems include increased flooding during spring runoff, increased avalanche hazard, and increased inconvenience to mountain communities. On the other hand, only <b>artificial</b> increases of <b>precipitation</b> in these occurrences can reasonably be attributed to cloud seeding. Therefore, it is worthwhile to include in the plan sufficient measurements {{that can be used to}} deal with such problems on a rational basis. Finally, a public education effort should be included so that information on all aspects of the cloud seeding program and its reason for being are available to the public. Research Framework The research associated with this program should be primarily directed toward achieving a definitive evaluation of seeding effects. To accomplish this goal, the evaluation must be specifically designed to do so. Therefore, there are two requirements placed upon the total program, one is to increase precipitation, the other is to clearly demonstrate that precipitation has indeed been increased. A secondary objective of the research is to develop a knowledge of the actual potential for increased precipitation in the target area. Measurements of relevant parameters over space and time are needed to determine the spatial and temporal variability as well as the frequency of seedable storms. At the same time, the vertical temperature stability at low levels is needed to determine the fraction of time ground seeding generators are effective. In order to increase precipitation efficiently, these measurements are needed anyway. The only extra work needed to improve our knowledge of seeding potential is an analysis of such data as it becomes available. Research to develop improved methods of indentifying seedability, determine what type of seeding material to use, or decide whether it is better to seed by air or ground requires systematic data collection, but the effort needs to be much more concentrated than appropriate for the general clouding seeding operation and evaluation described here. Such research data collection and evaluation are best left to controlled experiments such as are being conducted at Utah State University. The present project should, in contrast, emphasize measurements needed in the application of previous research results and evaluation of what is actually achieved by cloud seeding in an operational mode. The technology employed should not include promising methods or approaches still being studied but not yet tested in confirmatory experiments...|$|R

Other ions migrate with forces 3 to 10 times less than predicted by the Goldman equation for concentration differences alone. Our analysis showed that Ca 2 +, and perhaps Mg 2 +, might even be accumulated against concentration gradients under some circumstances. Their uptake was apparently driven by the diffusion potentials created by the outward migration of monovalent salts.

Simazine was almost completely depleted (97 %) in control soil by natural attenuation after 23 d, whereas in ?-soil only 70 % of simazine was removed. The addition of the simazine-degrading strain MHP 41 to ?-soil restored and upheld high stable simazine catabolic microorganisms as well as increased the simazine removal (87 %). The results indicated that simazine is subjected to microbial degradation with negligible leaching in this agricultural soil and pointed out the crucial role of native microbiota in the herbicide removal...|$|E
40|$|The {{contribution}} of any single uncertainty {{factor in the}} resulting performance of infield rain gauge measurements {{still has to be}} comprehensively assessed due to the high number of real world error sources involved, such as the intrinsic variability of rainfall intensity (RI), wind effects, wetting losses, the ambient temperature, etc. In recent years the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) addressed these issues by fostering dedicated investigations, which revealed further difficulties in assessing the actual reference rainfall intensity in the field. This work reports on an extensive assessment of the OTT Pluvio 2 weighing gauge accuracy when measuring rainfall intensity under laboratory dynamic conditions (time varying reference flow rates). The results obtained from the weighing rain gauge (WG) were also compared with a MTX tipping-bucket rain gauge (TBR) under the same test conditions. Tests were carried out by simulating various <b>artificial</b> <b>precipitation</b> events, with unsteady rainfall intensity, using a suitable dynamic rainfall generator. Real world rainfall data measured by an Ogawa catching-type drop counter at a field test site located within the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) were used as a reference for the artificial rain generation system. Results demonstrate that the differences observed between the laboratory and field performance of catching-type gauges are only partially attributable to the weather and operational conditions in the field. The dynamics of real world precipitation events is responsible for {{a large part of the}} measurement errors, which can be accurately assessed in the laboratory under controlled environmental conditions.

Increases of {{temperature}} and atmospheric N deposition are expected to affect forest growth directly and indirectly by increasing N availability due to higher rates of N mineralization. In {{order to understand the}} potential impacts of these changes, a mature balsam fir stand in Québec, Canada, was subjected during three consecutive growing seasons (2009 – 2011) to (i) experimentally increased soil temperature (4 °C) and earlier snowmelt (2 – 3 weeks) as well as (ii) increased inorganic N concentration in <b>artificial</b> <b>precipitation</b> (3 × current N concentrations using 15 NH 4 - 15 NO 3). Soil inorganic N was measured using buried ion-exchange membranes (PRS™ probes) and standard soil extractions. Dendrometers were used to monitor the variations in diameter growth and needles were analyzed annually for N to assess the nutritional response of trees. Results from the second (2010) and third (2011) year of treatment are reported. After three years of treatment, there was no significant increase in soil nitrate (NO 3) or ammonium (NH 4) availability either in the organic or in the mineral soil as measured with standard soil extractions. Similar results were obtained with ion-exchange membranes, except for NH 4 in the forest floor, which increased by an average of 54 % over the two years. No effect of treatments were observed on needle N or diameter growth, but an 8 -day earlier peak in diameter growth was measured in heated plots in 2010. We attributed the limited effects of our treatments to the acute soil competition for available N at the site. As a result, the projected modifications of the forest N cycle and concomitant increased forest growth due to an earlier snowmelt, increased soil temperature and N deposition should be considered with caution in similar cold N-poor ecosystems...|$|E

40|$|Climate change {{resulted}} in changes in crop growth duration and planting structure, northward movement of planting region, and more severe plant diseases and insect pests in Northwest China.

To adapt to climate change, {{measures such as}} optimization of agricultural arrangement, adjustment of planting structure, expansion of thermophilic crops, and development of water-saving agriculture have been taken. Damaging consequences of imbalance between grassland and livestock were enhanced. The deterioration trend of grassland was intensified; both grass quantity and quality declined. With overgrazing, proportions of inferior grass, weeds and poisonous weeds increased in plateau pastoral areas. Returning farmland to grazing, returning grazing to grassland, fence enclosure and artificial grassland construction have been implemented to restore the grassland vegetation, to increase the grassland coverage, to reasonably control the livestock carrying capacity, to prevent overgrazing, to keep balance between grassland and livestock, and to develop the ecological animal husbandry. In Northwest China, because the amount of regional water resources had an overall decreasing trend, there was a continuous expansion in the regional land desertification, and soil erosion was very serious. A series of measures, such as development of <b>artificial</b> <b>precipitation</b> (snow), water resources control, regional water diversion, water storage project and so on, were used effectively to respond to water deficit.

40|$|This {{study is}} devoted to the energy balance of the earth's surface with a special {{emphasis}} on practical applications. A simple picture of the energy exchange processes that take place at the ground is the following. Per unit time and area an amount of radiant energy is supplied to the surface. This radiation originates partly from the sun, but an~ other fraction is coming from the atmosphere (= infra-red radiation emitted by clouds, water vapour and CO 2 ). From these gain terms the following losses must be subtracted: (a) the reflected solar radiation and (b) the infra-red radiation emitted by the surface itself. The final result is that a net amount of radiant energy is received by the surface, simply denoted as net radiation. At the ground net radiation is used to heat the ground (soil heat flux), to evaporate liquid water (evaporation), and to heat the atmosphere (sensible heat flux). In this simple picture we have neglected minor terms such as the energy used by the plants for their photosynthesis. Due to the high value of the latent heat of vaporization, the energy needed for evaporation is often an important term in the energy balance. In addition the energy balance of the earth's surface is linked with the water budget of both the atmosphere and the earth's surface, through the evaporation at the ground. Several practical questions in agriculture, hydrology and meteorology require information m the energy balance of the surface. It is {{the purpose of this study}} to find solutions for some of these problems. In hydrology one is mainly concerned in evaporation averaged over 1 day or more on a regional scale. Generally, this refers to land surfaces, but the evaporation of inland lakes or reservoirs is also of interest. In this context we also mention the problem of thermal pollution of open water bodies by industry or power plants. For this the so-called natural water temperature must be known, which is the temperature of the water in the hypothetical case that there is no artificial heating. It appears that this temperature depends mainly m the energy balance at the surface. In Chapter VI a model dealing with this problem is discussed. In agriculture one is interested also in evaporation. Now time intervals ranging from half an hour to several days are of interest. The relation between evaporation an the one side and plant diseases and pest control an the other can be mentioned. Furthermore, the yield of several agricultural crops is the greatest when the evapotranspiration is potential (= a maximum under the given weather conditions). When the crop transpires less than the potential rate, because the soil is too dry, the yield can be augmented by <b>artificial</b> <b>precipitation.</b> For applications such as these cheap and simple techniques are required for measuring the actual and potential evaporation. This applies also to agricultural research projects, e. g. to determine yield-water use relationships. In Chapter II simple measurement techniques are considered. Recent developments in meteorology have led to an increase of the interest in the energy balance of the earth's surface, especially in the input of heat and humidity at ground level into the atmosphere. Examples are models for the atmospheric boundary layer and related models for short range weather forecasts (12 - 18 h ahead). These models require simple parameterizations of the surface fluxes. This applies also to weather forecast models on a medium time range (3 - 10 days ahead). Since the height of the boundary layer is related to the heat input at the ground information an the surface energy balance is needed also for air pollution problems. In Chapter III a simple parameterization for evaporation and sensible heat flux is described that can be used for these type of problems. Usually, the only available data are standard weather observations. For that reason, many of the practical questions, mentioned above, can be formulated as: "How can the surface energy balance be estimated from standard weather data only'?" In Chapters III and VI possible answers to that question are discussed. Chapter II {{is devoted to}} simple measuring techniques that, in principle, can be used on an operational base. These methods will be compared with the so-called energy-balance method, using Bowen's ratio. In Chapter III two models for evaporation and sensible heat flux during daytime are compared. Both require standard weather data as input and an indication of the surface wetness. The first model needs more data, but contains more physics. The second is less complete, but requires less input data. Chapter IV has a mainly theoretical character. A model is presented that couples the evolution of the atmospheric boundary layer to the surface energy balance. It describes the course of the height, temperature and humidity of the boundary layer, together with the surface fluxes, when the initial profiles of temperature and humidity the radiative forcing and the surface wetness are known. It is restricted to convective conditions. Model output will be compared with observations. In Chapter V an empirical evaporation model for open water is considered. Comparisons with observations of evaporation of the former Lake Flevo will be made; the annual and the diurnal cycle will be considered. In Chapter VI a model for the (natural) temperature and energy balance of inland lakes and water reservoirs is discussed that requires standard weather data only. A comparison between the calculated and measured water temperature will be given. This concerns two adjacent water reservoirs, which have about the same size, but which differ in depth (5 and 15 m). This is of importance, since the water temperature also depends on water depth. At some places we made new modifications, but most of the theoretical concepts applied in this study are adopted from literature. This is inherent in our practical approach. Some of the theories used have been available for many years. But, e. g. because no suitable instruments were available, they were not usefull for practical applications. Recent developments in the field of instrumentation and data handling have changed the situation-to our advantage. A good example is the temperature fluctuation method for measuring the sensible heat flux (discussed in 11. 4). The theoretical basis for this approach was given by Prandtl already in 1932. But for an experimental verification we had to wait until the sixties and early seventies. In that period instruments were developed to measure turbulent surface fluxes and fast temperature fluctuations, while also the data handling techniques were improved significantly. Finally) the method wouldn't be operationally until quite recently. For the verification of the parameterizations, measuring techniques and models treated in this study, we used data collected at the 200 m mast at Cabauw, and at the nearby micrometeorological field, of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute...|$|E
40|$|A {{new concept}} of road runoff management, based on diffuse {{infiltration}} over the shoulder, was {{tested in a}} real-scale experimentation site located near Grandson, Switzerland. This new concept consists in diffusely infiltrating the road runoff in the infiltration slope adjoining the road shoulder; where road contaminants are retained. This presupposed that the road shoulder was as tightened as possible to effectively drive the road runoff to the slope, and that the infiltration slope effectively retains all road pollutants. Those two main postulates needed strong scientific verification. For this purpose, five different shoulder designs were tested in Grandson to assess which one presented the best hydraulic performance, i. e. which shoulder was the most impervious. Those designs were made of gravel mixed with humus (SGL), gravel mixed with clay (SGC), gravel seeded with lawn (SGL), a prolonged HMF road base (SH), and a bentonitic geotextile tightening (SB). Also, to verify the retention of pollutant, two infiltration slopes adjoining SGL (LW) and SH (LH) were set as lysimeter (basal geomembrane collecting road effluents); the third infiltration slope (LB) had a direct connection with the aquifer which was closely monitored (6 piezometers located up- and downstream from the road; influence of the road runoff was thus emphasized). Finally, {{to ensure that this}} new concept do not lower the road bearing capacity, deflectometers were placed in the road structure; 3 campaigns of leveling assessed the road settlement. Hydraulic assessment of the shoulders, based on 112 natural precipitation as well as 3 artificial watering tests, showed strong discrepancies between all shoulders behaviours. They had to deal with potentially high amount of water. Lag times ranged from a few minutes to several hours. Results showed that lag times were only function of the precipitation mean intensity. The infiltration process could be assessed by a modified Green & Ampt equation. The moisturizing front was frank and linearly progressed downward. Shoulders vertical hydraulic conductivities ranged from 4. 6 · 10 - 6 (SGC) to 2. 2 · 10 - 5 m·s- 1 (SGL). The exfiltration volume is function of the water volume available at the shoulder surface. The drought preceding the rain event has no influence on the stock variation or the exfiltration volume. Road runoff used two different infiltration paths: the macroporosity drives the water efficiently and rapidly, while the microporosity is less efficient and retains the moisture longer. Tracer tests (Brine) proved that the contamination first flush passed over the shoulders. This is also confirmed by the flux calculation. Runoff coefficients CR ranged from 0. 3 (SGL) to 0. 9 (SB). This coefficient decreased rapidly once the shoulder is wet. Only SB really fulfilled its task, letting water through only in harsh hydraulic conditions (100 mm; 40 mm/h). It is highly recommended for further road development: for new roads as well as old roads being refurbished. The shoulder SH proved to be inefficient for structural and material reasons. Other shoulders are comparatively ineffective. SGC must be enhanced; in that case it could offer a valuable alternative. The bearing capacity of the road was very good. The road lifetime was evaluated to more than 20 years (1 · 109 residual standard axle load). The Grandson experimental site could not conclusively demonstrate a worsening of the geotechnical behaviour of the road. This is due to the particularly good material and road pavement thickness used for this road. Infiltrations in shoulders are high enough and would have doubtless caused a loss of bearing capacity in case the road would have been more modestly dimensioned. It is therefore clear that the shoulder must be tightened. Geochemical results concerned six families of contaminant: MTE, PAH, Cx, BTEX, MTBE, and PCB. Batch and column tests allowed calculating MTE and PAH distribution coefficient Kd in the Grandson soils, as well as in other typical Swiss soils. Results showed that mobile elements are B, Br, Mo, Ba, Sb, Zn, and V (0 175). Comparisons with other typical soils enlightened the predominant influence of the pH. Batch test performed with acidic soils (pH = 5. 5) confirmed lower MTE Kd. MTE are thus more mobile in acidic soils. Other physicochemical parameters have a smaller influence. The column test performed with a synthetically loaded solution (MTE and PAH) infiltrating the Grandson soils showed that MTE are more mobile in dynamic conditions. This is easily explained by the reduced contact time between the contaminant and the soil aggregates. PAH were not detected at the column outlet, thus showing a very good retention in the column soil. Soil layers analyses demonstrated that PAH were mostly retained in the surface layers. Also, MTE with low mobility show the same behaviour. Mobile elements showed no preferential retention layer. Concerning the infiltration slope, lag times were usually greater than those encountered for the shoulders. Lag time were function of the rain mean intensity. The influence of the preceding drought was significant. Exfiltration volumes EL were high in case of large event; it could be approximated by a simple equation function of the API and surface available water. Moisture redistribution processes occurred in the soils {{as long as there is}} a volumetric water content θ gradient. Fluxes strongly varied in magnitude and direction during a precipitation event: usually from about 1 · 10 - 8 to 1 · 10 - 5 m·s- 1 and from up- to downward (evaporation to infiltration). The first flush effect was poor to medium. NaCl signal was highly buffered. The pH was also completely buffered by the soil high carbonate content. It thus shifted from 6. 5 in the rainwater to 8 in the LW exfiltration water. To especially emphasize the geochemical behaviour, an <b>artificial</b> <b>precipitation</b> test was created to control every aspect of the rainfall. It was judged very representative of a natural storm. MTE and PAH contaminants had two different behaviours: mobile elements moved mainly in solute and have concentration correlated with EC. Elements with low mobility had higher concentrations correlated with the turbidity peaks. They were transported sorbed to particles. Comparison between the particular and solute form concentrations confirmed that mobile elements are measured in similar concentrations whether the sample was filtered at 0. 45 µm, at 1 µm, or not filtered at all prior to acidification. On the contrary, less mobile elements are easily sorbed to particles. The MTE concentrations under sorbed form range from 5 % (Rb, Sb) to 98 % (Pb) of the total concentration. They had strong first flush effects. B, V, Cr, Mn, Ni, CU, Zn, Br, Mo, Cd, Sb, and Pb were identified as road tracers. Fe and Al represented 80 % of the road runoff. Overall, the total MTE concentration in the lysimeter first water collected decreased to 1 / 30 th of the road runoff first flush concentration. Mobile elements were less retained. The PAH total concentration in the lysimeter first collected water was about 1 ' 000 times lower than in the road runoff first flush. The PAH concentration was mainly constituted by mobile PAH naphthalene and phenanthrene. Cx were well represented in the road runoff. However, only heavy species were commonly found. C 32 was the most common specie. The triplet C 16 -C 18 -C 20 was always present in high concentration in the lysimeter exfiltration water. This triple is a great road tracer. BTEX, while present in the road runoff, were not detected in the lysimeter exfiltration water. The alluvial aquifer was also monitored. It is confined between the Arnon (north) and a basement till which shallows up southward. Eastern and western limit are less known but might coincide with the river. The aquifer is clearly linked to the river. This is proved by the piezometric level, EC and T follow-up. EC and temperature also emphasized the higher activity in downstream piezometer. The road runoff infiltration could not be emphasized by the NaCl tracer test. The infiltrated water concentration was possibly buffered by the aquifer volume. Also, the brine was heavier than the aquifer water: it could have plunged to the bottom of the aquifer. All families of contaminant are presented in the aquifer. However, the provenance of those contaminants remains uncertain. The groundwater was indeed as concentrated upstream as downstream. Moreover, the river concentrations had similar, or even higher, values. The contamination provenance is thus either the aerial deposition (equally distributed up- and downstream), either the Arnon River infiltrating the aquifer. The contaminant behaviours in the aquifer could be described. It confirmed the contaminant mobility previously noted during the batch, column and test precipitation experiments. Mobile substances are seen in higher concentrations, whereas substances with low mobility are sparsely found. This project thus demonstrated that the new "over the shoulder diffuse infiltration" concept is clearly implementable. Aquifer concentrations were compared to Swiss legal concentration limits. Except for Cr, the aquifer water was of drinkable quality. This proved that the concept is robust, environmental-friendly and conclusive...|$|E
