40|$|The <b>Atmosphere</b> <b>Controller</b> is an {{implementation}} of home networking technology {{that could make}} life at home a totally new experience. An atmosphere is created by combining light (intensity and colour), music and wallpaper projection. To find out if is this type of experience fits into everyday life of people, we studied the current experience of creating atmospheres by conducting interviews and probes studies in people's homes [5]. The same people were later invited to test the application in a Lab environment. Although the lab tests showed that the <b>Atmosphere</b> <b>controller</b> offers a positive sensorial experience further research should be conducted in a more realistic setting...|$|E

The luminous atmosphere desired by the occupants is defined by the amount and the distribution of light entering the room. These criteria reflect the mean optic state of the room. In tertiary building, the rooms generally have several artificial and natural light sources, this is why the light controller developed here is based on an optimization method to determine the best distribution of light flows among all the sources. The optimal solution is computed by considering various goals like minimizing the energy consumption. In this paper, the authors present a new extension of the luminous <b>atmosphere</b> <b>controller</b> that prevents glare caused by the daylight from occurring in the room. Detection of outdoor dazzling sources is performed by a fisheye video camera fixed on the building envelope. A numerical method is then used to determine the areas of potential glare within the room and to define operating limits on actuators in order to reject them. To show the impact of glare rejection on the luminous <b>atmosphere</b> <b>controller,</b> the authors have simulated the control in a room equipped with automated Venetian blinds and lights during a whole day...|$|E
40|$|Air {{drag forces}} are {{introduced}} into the equations for a slewing control maneuver of a flexible structure to assess the effects of <b>atmosphere</b> on the <b>controller</b> design. Simulated modal parameters and transient responses are compared with experiments in normal atmosphere and in vacuum. Analytical techniques for control laws are examined and verified. Physical insight into the air damping is gained so that results in vacuum can be extrapolated from results in air...|$|R
40|$|Four {{atmospheric}} guidance concepts {{have been}} adapted to control an interplanetary vehicle aerobraking in the Martian atmosphere. The first two offer {{improvements to the}} Analytic Predictor Corrector (APC) to increase its robustness to density variations. The second two are variations of a new Liapunov tracking exit phase algorithm, developed to guide the vehicle along a reference trajectory. These four new controllers are tested using a six degree of freedom computer simulation to evaluate their robustness. MARSGRAM is used to develop realistic atmospheres for the study. When square wave density pulses perturb the <b>atmosphere</b> all four <b>controllers</b> are successful. The algorithms are tested against atmospheres where the inbound and outbound density functions are different. Square wave density pulses are again used, but only for the outbound leg of the trajectory. Additionally, sine waves are used to perturb the density function. The new algorithms {{are found to be}} more robust than any previously tested and a Liapunov controller is selected as the most robust control algorithm overall examined...|$|R
