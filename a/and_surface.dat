30|$|In {{order to}} reserve the {{advantages}} of Bézier model and improve the shape adjustability of curves <b>and</b> <b>surfaces,</b> scholars have constructed many Bézier curves <b>and</b> <b>surfaces</b> with shape parameters [11 – 18]. The common features of these curves <b>and</b> <b>surfaces</b> are as follows: (1) they inherit most of properties of Bézier curves and surfaces; (2) they all have shape parameters used to adjust the shape of these curves <b>and</b> <b>surfaces</b> handily; (3) the absence of rational fractions in their expressions makes them simpler than rational Bézier and NURBS curves <b>and</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Thus these curves <b>and</b> <b>surfaces</b> have extensive applications in describing complex curves <b>and</b> <b>surfaces.</b> However, the expressions of these Bézier curves <b>and</b> <b>surfaces</b> with shape parameters are polynomials; and consequently, they face the problem of smooth continuity in constructing complex curves <b>and</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Therefore, when researchers defined their curves <b>and</b> <b>surfaces</b> with shape parameters in [11 – 15], they also further studied the C 1, C 2 or G 1, G 2 continuity conditions of their proposed curves, but the continuity conditions of these surfaces have not been studied until now (note: the continuity conditions of the surfaces in [16 – 18] are also not studied). Compared with the research on smooth continuity between Bézier curves with shape parameters, the corresponding research on Bézier surfaces with shape parameters has not been extensively done and the relevant research results are relatively few. In this paper, we make some improvements to the Bézier-like <b>surfaces</b> in [17] <b>and</b> construct a kind of high-order generalized Bézier-like surfaces associated with multiple shape parameters. To improve the ability of describing complex surfaces by using the proposed surfaces, we lay emphasis {{on the study of}} G 2 continuity conditions of these surfaces.|$|R
