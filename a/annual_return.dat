5|$|Norway Airlines was {{established}} on 2 April 1987 by Kjell Adserø and his holding company Hell Holding, {{along with several}} other investors from Trøndelag—the largest of which was Lyng Industrier. The business model was to operate charter flights from Norway to the Mediterranean; {{eighty percent of the}} market was carried out with foreign airlines and Adserø believed that Norwegians not only would prefer a Norwegian carrier, but {{would be willing to pay}} more for one. The company had an initial share capital of NOK10 million and established its head office and main base at Stavanger Airport, Sola. Separate companies, organized as kommandittselskap, wer established to own each aircraft and lease them to the airline. The aircraft owner companies paid 28.7 million United States dollars for each Boeing 737-300, which were delivered new from Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Shares in the aircraft owning companies was offered to the public with a four-percent <b>annual</b> <b>return</b> on investment. Part of the investment model was based on tax advantages.|$|E
5|$|Though Patton had ambitions {{to enact}} {{education}} reform {{early in his}} administration, his financial adviser, James R. Ramsey, convinced him to propose a conservative budget in the first legislative session. The two developed a plan to modernize the state government, making it more efficient. State employees were leery of increased efficiency, believing it was a code word for cutting state jobs. Patton dispelled this notion by promising no involuntary layoffs. Patton also anticipated difficulty persuading legislators to invest an estimated $100million in equipment and processes to realize improved efficiency. However, when economists projected a budget surplus for 1996, Patton agreed to invest half of it in capital projects in exchange for using the other half for measures to improve government efficiency. Patton formed an Office for Technology and made improvements in the compatibility and interoperability of the state's computer systems that were recommended by his son, Chris. Investments of $23.3million yielded a return of $300million in state revenue. By the time Patton's efficiency program was fully implemented, the state was realizing an <b>annual</b> <b>return</b> of 75cents for every dollar initially invested.|$|E
25|$|Ramsey {{states that}} investors {{can get a}} 12% average <b>annual</b> <b>return</b> {{and this is the}} number he uses in {{financial}} analyses. Critics state that using an average <b>annual</b> <b>return</b> rate is misleading and that the compound annual growth rate is a better measurement when planning investments. Most individuals are unaware of this difference. Critics have also stated that a 12% return is unrealistic. According to the Motley Fool, following Ramsey's calculations could cause individuals to be seriously under-invested for retirement.|$|E

40|$|LL. M. (Commercial Law) Abstract: It is {{important}} that a companies’ register provides sufficient transparency of information, {{in order to ensure}} that the incorporation of a company is not a façade for those persons controlling, managing and owning companies. It has become evident that the most adequate means of ensuring compliance with the provisions of company law relating to the lodging of <b>annual</b> <b>returns</b> is the imposition of some form of punishment or penalty on defaulting companies. Despite companies being subjected to some form of a penalty or punishment for their failure to conform to the obligation to submit <b>annual</b> <b>returns</b> it appears that there is still a certain degree of non-compliance with this obligation in all three of the jurisdictions contemplated. This dissertation considers the duty to file <b>annual</b> <b>returns</b> in South Africa, Singapore and the UK. South Africa has successfully attempted to decriminalise company law in line with the objects of the Companies Act 71 of 2008, by treating criminal prosecution for the failure to submit corporate <b>annual</b> <b>returns</b> as a matter of last resort. Singapore has placed focus on the education of directors and other persons managing or controlling companies in lieu of prosecution where a person is in contravention of the requirements to submit <b>annual</b> <b>returns.</b> Where a company is in default for its failure to file <b>annual</b> <b>returns,</b> the UK prescribes a penalty in accordance with the length of the default. An apparent need for reform is presented in South Africa. The introduction of the confirmation statement in the UK and the education of directors in lieu of prosecution in Singapore can inform this process for reform...|$|R

30|$|Much of the {{theoretical}} finance literature uses <b>annual</b> <b>returns</b> from different investments, including timber, for comparing risk and return, Capital Asset Pricing, and portfolio optimisation (e.g., Redmond and Cubbage 1988, Cascio and Clutter 2008, Mei and Clutter 2010). Internal rate of return is often used {{as a proxy for}} <b>annual</b> <b>returns</b> in the forest finance literature, making it comparable other asset class analyses. So use of <b>annual</b> <b>returns</b> and IRR are widely accepted even in theory for finance applications. Internal rate of return also remains in wide use in the forest products industry. Hogaboam and Shook (2004) found that 52 % of forest products firms used IRR as their preferred capital budgeting criteria, versus only 18 % who preferred NPV. Last, IRR or <b>annual</b> rate of <b>return</b> surely is the most common metric referred to in timber investment conferences and by TIMOs and REITs (e.g., Leal 2008).|$|R
