The station's stone fruit and quince collections are the largest and most important in Russia or any part of the former Soviet Union. Of the 9,000 accessions of Prunus, about 5,000 to 6,000 are wild species and forms, 500 to 1,000 local varieties, and 2,000 to 3,000 cultivars and breeding materials. The station is also known for the creation of fruit-tree rootstocks, which are named after the town + a number (e.g. Krymsk 1, Krymsk 2, etc.) ...|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} produce ajvar, bell peppers and <b>aubergines</b> (<b>eggplants)</b> are roasted whole on a plate on an open fire, a plate of wood in a stove, or in an oven. The baked peppers must briefly rest in a closed dish, {{to allow them to}} cool and to allow the flesh to {{separate}} from the skin. Next, the skin is carefully peeled off and the seeds are removed. The peppers are then ground in a mill or chopped into tiny pieces (this variant {{is often referred to as}} Pindjur). Finally, the resulting mush is stewed for a couple of hours in large pots. Sunflower oil and garlic are added at this stage in order to condense and reduce the water, as well as to enhance later conservation. Salt (and sometimes also vinegar) is added at the end and the hot mush is poured directly into glass jars, which are sealed immediately.|$|E
40|$|In view of {{the gradual}} global banning of {{chemicals}} used in pest control in packaging fruit, the Cook Islands have trialled and adopted a viable alternative in heat treatment which meets quarantine requirements for their exports of papaya. In a good year, the country produces, besides for domestic consumption, 258 tonnes, worth US$ 322, 000, for export mainly to New Zealand. Previously ethylene dibromide (EDB) was used to control fruit flies (Bactrocera melanotus and B. xanthodes), the quarantine pests which require control in papaya. Since 1994 however, New Zealand has banned imports of produce treated with this fumigant. The Cook Islands therefore adopted a high-temperature forced-air (HTFA) treatment, comprising basically a treatment of 47. 2 %C for 20 minutes in sealed chambers. There is one heat treatment facility in the Cook Islands, with a capacity to treat 1, 600 tonnes of fruit annually. Heat-treated mangoes have been exported and there are plans to expand exports to other produce, including <b>aubergines</b> (<b>eggplants).</b> If carried out properly, the treatment even enhances the market quality of fruit. It produces an even colour on the fruit, and slows down the rate of internal ripening. This helps to extend fruit shelf-life and the fruit flesh does not develop the bitterness which is characteristic of fruit treated with EDB. The treatment can also be adapted for controlling temperate pests in avocadoes, litchis, bell peppers, nectarines and apricots.

5|$|Some {{species of}} {{parasitic}} wasp, {{especially in the}} Trichogrammatidae, are exploited commercially to provide biological control of insect pests. For example, in Brazil, farmers control sugarcane borers with the parasitic wasp Trichogramma galloi. One of the first species to be used was Encarsia formosa, a parasitoid {{of a range of}} species of whitefly. It entered commercial use in the 1920s in Europe, was overtaken by chemical pesticides in the 1940s, and again received interest from the 1970s. Encarsia is used especially in greenhouses to control whitefly pests of tomato and cucumber, {{and to a lesser extent}} of <b>aubergine</b> (<b>eggplant),</b> flowers such as marigold, and strawberry. Several species of parasitic wasp are natural predators of aphids and can help to control them. For instance, Aphidius matricariae is used to control the peach-potato aphid.|$|R

40|$|Prognosis of {{melanoma}} {{patients with}} metastatic disease is very poor. For example, over 95 % of melanoma patients {{with three or}} more sites of metastatic disease die within 1 year. Treatment failure usually occurs because the drugs used {{for the treatment of}} these patients have a low capacity to kill melanoma cells selectively. By using human UACC- 62 melanoma cells and human VH- 10 skin non-malignant cells, here we show that the glycolysis inhibitors dichloroacetate and 2 -deoxyglucose, and an extract from the skin of the fruit of Solanum melongena (<b>aubergine,</b> <b>eggplant),</b> induce selective killing of melanoma cells. This selective anticancer activity was higher than that of the anticancer drugs etoposide, 5 -fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and hydroxyurea. The glycolysis inhibitor 3 -bromopyruvate did not show selective cytotoxicity towards the cancer cell line. We also report that UACC- 62 melanoma cells have higher glycolytic rates (glucose consumption and lactate production) than VH- 10 skin non-malignant cells, which may help explain the selective cytotoxicity of the glycolysis inhibitors dichloroacetate and 2 -deoxyglucose towards the melanoma cell line. Since 2 -deoxyglucose and dichloroacetate have already entered clinical trials for the treatment of specific cancers, our results support their possible advancement into clinical trials for the treatment melanoma patients with metastatic disease. The selective anticancer activity of the extract from the aubergine skin warrants further investigation...|$|R
