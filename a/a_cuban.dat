5|$|The {{start of}} the game was delayed by rain for 56 minutes.

5|$|After a British spy boat sinks, {{a marine}} archaeologist, Sir Timothy Havelock, is tasked to {{retrieve}} its Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator (ATAC) communication system before the Russians do.

While investigating, Bond is captured, but Gonzales is subsequently killed by Havelock's daughter Melina, and she and Bond escape. Bond identifies one of those present with Gonzales as Emile Leopold Locque and so follows a lead to Italy and meets his contact, Luigi Ferrara, and a well-connected Greek businessman and intelligence informant, Aris Kristatos. Kristatos tells Bond that Locque is employed by Milos Columbo, Kristatos' former organised crime partner.|$|E
5|$|Impressed by Betances' credentials, Angiolillo later {{approached}} Betances {{before the}} incident, and discussed his plans with him, which originally implied killing {{one or more}} young members of the Spanish royal family. Betances then dissuaded him from doing this. Angiolillo then apparently suggested Cánovas as a target instead. There is evidence that Betances financed Angiolillo's travel to Spain, and used his contacts to have Angiolillo reach and enter Spanish territory under a false identity. Further speculation that Angiolillo used a firearm that Betances himself furnished for him appears to be unfounded (although Betances, who was a fan of firearms himself —he taught <b>a</b> <b>Cuban</b> revolutionary leader {{on how to use}} a Remington machine gun once— gave at least one as a gift to one of his acquaintances).|$|E
