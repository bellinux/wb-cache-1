40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} how judgments of perceived duration {{are influenced by}} the properties of the signals that define the intervals. Participants compared two auditory intervals that could be any combination of the following four types: intervals filled with continuous tones (filled intervals), intervals filled with regularly-timed short tones (isochronous intervals), intervals filled with irregularly-timed short tones (<b>anisochronous</b> intervals), and intervals demarcated by two short tones (empty intervals). Results indicate that the type of intervals to be compared affects discrimination performance and induces distortions in perceived duration. In particular, we find that duration judgments are most precise when comparing two isochronous and two continuous intervals, while the comparison of two <b>anisochronous</b> intervals leads to the worst performance. Moreover, we determined that the magnitude of the distortions in perceived duration (an effect akin to the filled duration illusion) is higher for tone sequences (no matter whether isochronous or <b>anisochronous)</b> than for continuous tones. Further analysis of how duration distortions depend on the type of filling suggests that distortions are not only due to the perceived duration of the two individual intervals, but they may also be due to the comparison of two different filling types...|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies show}} that visual stimuli {{traveling}} at higher velocities are overestimated with respect to slower, or stationary, stimuli of equivalent physical duration. This effect-time dilation-relates more in general to several accounts highlighting a quantitative relationship {{between the amount of}} changes a stimulus is subject to and the perceived duration: faster stimuli, subject to a greater number of changes in space, lead to overestimated durations of displacement. In the present paper we provide evidence of a new illusory effect, in which the apparent duration of a sensory event is affected by the way a constant number of changes are delivered in time, or in time and space. Participants judged accelerating and decelerating sequences of stationary flickering stimuli (Experiments 1 and 3) and accelerating and decelerating horizontally drifting visual stimuli (Experiment 2) on the fronto-parallel plane. Acceleration and deceleration were achieved by irregular sequencing of events in time (<b>anisochronous</b> flicker rate) or irregular sequencing of events in time and space (<b>anisochronous</b> and/or anisometric drift). Despite being characterized by the same amounts of visual changes, accelerating and decelerating sequences lead to opposite duration biases (underestimation and overestimation errors, respectively). We refer to this effect in terms of ATI: Aniso-Time-Illusion. This bias was observed in both subsecond (760 ms) and suprasecond ranges (1900 ms).

40|$|AbstractDistortions of {{perceived}} duration can give crucial {{insights into the}} mechanisms that underlie the processing and representation of stimulus timing. One factor that affects duration estimates is the temporal structure of stimuli that fill an interval. For example, regular filling (isochronous interval) leads to an overestimation {{of perceived}} duration as compared to irregular filling (<b>anisochronous</b> interval). In the present article, we use electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the neural basis of this subjective lengthening of perceived duration with isochrony. In a two-interval forced choice task, participants judged which of two intervals lasts longer – one always being isochronous, the other one <b>anisochronous.</b> Response proportions confirm the subjective overestimation of isochronous intervals. At the neural level, isochronous sequences are associated with enhanced pairwise phase consistency (PPC) at the stimulation frequency, reflecting the brain's entrainment to the regular stimulation. The PPC over the entrainment channels is further enhanced for isochronous intervals that are reported to be longer, and {{the magnitude of this}} PCC effect correlates with the amount of perceptual bias. Neural entrainment has been proposed as a mechanism of attentional selection, enabling increased neural responsiveness toward stimuli that arrive at an expected point in time. The present results support the proposed relationship between neural response magnitudes and temporal estimates: An increase in neural responsiveness leads to a more pronounced representation of the individual stimuli filling the interval and in turn to a subjective increase in duration...|$|E

(J Acoust Soc Am 112 : 621 - 33, 2002) {{found that}} a pulse train with {{alternating}} inter-pulse intervals between 4 and 6 ms (“ 4 - 6 stimulus”) is perceived as having a periodicity of 5. 7 ms. Using a model that relies on neuronal first order intervals (FOIs) for pitch perception, they showed that {{the recovery of the}} auditory nerve from adaptation is not sufficient to explain this effect and suggested that a weighting function that favours longer FOI intervals was needed to account for the perceived pitch. Here we investigate whether there are neurons, or populations of neurons, at the next stage of processing, the cochlear nucleus (CN), that give greater representation to longer intervals. We measured the responses of single neurons in the ventral CN of anesthetised guinea pigs to isochronous and <b>anisochronous</b> pulse trains. Pulse trains were band-pass filtered between 3900 Hz and 5300 Hz. Isochronous pulse trains had interpulse intervals of 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 ms. <b>Anisochronous</b> pulse trains had alternating interpulse intervals between 4 and 6 ms. The results are based on the responses of 58 units, classified by the shape of their post stimulus time histograms as Primary with notch (PN, 9), transient chopper (CT, 22), sustained chopper (CS, 10) and onsets (ON, 17). PN and CT units showed a recovery behaviour that is quantitatively similar to the auditory nerve. ON and CS units showed a faster recovery between 4 and 6 ms, but not enough to account for the size of the psychophysical effect. The average of FOI distributions for single units generally has too many long intervals to account for the observed pitch of the 4 - 6 stimulus. When sequentially interleaving the spikes from all units the average FOI distribution contains more shorter intervals, but, by interleaving spikes from just 2 to 4 units the average FOI becomes small enough to explain the observed pitch of the 4 - 6 stimulus.
