25|$|On November 2, 1923 (21 {{months after}} Taylor's murder) Gibson {{was arrested at}} her home at 2324 North Beachwood Drive, Los Angeles, California on federal felony charges {{involving}} an alleged nationwide blackmail and extortion ring. She was subsequently charged with extortion and violation of Section 145 of the Federal Criminal Code. George W. Lasher told authorities he had paid Gibson $1155 to avoid prosecution for a reputed violation of the Mann Act. Gibson was also said {{to be connected to}} two convicted blackmailers who had pleaded guilty the preceding week to extorting $10,000 from Ohio banker John L. Bushnell. <b>Amid</b> <b>all</b> the publicity following her arrest she was mentioned as both Margaret Gibson and Patricia Palmer. The charges were later dropped by the district attorney's office. Over the next six years she worked sporadically in bit parts and minor supporting roles but the industry's transition to sound film saw the end of Gibson's already thwarted career.|$|E

25|$|On June 6, 1904, one of Dunovant's brothers-in-law, W. E. Calhoun fired {{a bullet}} through Eldridge's right lung from ambush but his {{intended}} target survived. Eldridge was tried for Dunovant's murder in November 1904 but {{found not guilty}} based on his plea of self-defense. A few weeks later Eldridge found that Calhoun was a passenger on the same train and gunned him down also. In January 1907 Eldridge was tried for Calhoun's murder at Bellville and acquitted again. Eldridge left the area and became partners with Isaac Herbert Kempner who founded the Imperial Sugar Company at Sugar Land. He died in Houston in 1932. <b>Amid</b> <b>all</b> this turmoil, the Cane Belt Railroad came close to bankruptcy. On November 11, 1903, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe bought the railroad for $1.6 million, including $850,000 for stock and $750,000 for outstanding bonds. On April 11, 1905, the Texas Legislature passed a law allowing the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe to lease or sell the Cane Belt Railroad to its subsidiary, the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe. That railroad agreed to lease the Cane Belt on July 1, 1905.|$|E

The Sunday Tribunes Neil Dunphy selected it as his CD of the week, calling it [...] "a wonderful exploration of a sound often derided for being in thrall to its influences" [...] and commenting: [...] "I don't know why but Bell X1 used to make me cringe.

[...] In another interview McIlrath stated, [...] "It was a way to document what's going on, like other artists documented for their generation and for generations to come."

Greg Kot of The Chicago Tribune described {{one of their}} Chicago performances as [...] "off-kilter" [...] and wrote that [...] "Deal's pungent vocals were {{swallowed up by the}} guitars, and the foursome's slight melodies were lost <b>amid</b> <b>all</b> the bashing." [...] A review in The Chicago Reader of the same concert noted that [...] "The Amps play with a low-key, hangout sound." [...] The Phoenixs Matt Ashare felt that at their December 1995 show in Boston [...] "the Amps didn't click {{in a way that would}} suggest that this was Deal's new, full-time band"; he added that it was [...] "an unpretentiously gritty way for Deal to let off some steam while the Breeders [...] a little break".

[...] Guard later told journalist Richard Hadlock in Down Beat magazine: [...] "We are not students of folk music; the basic thing for us is honest and worthwhile songs that people can pick up and become involved in." [...] Nick Reynolds added in the same article: [...] "We don't collect old songs {{in the sense that}} the academic cats do... We get new tunes to look over every day. Each one of us has his ears open constantly to new material or old stuff that's good." [...] Bob Shane remarked years later: [...] "To call the Kingston Trio folksingers was kind of stupid in the first place. We never called ourselves folksingers... We did folk-oriented material, but we did it <b>amid</b> <b>all</b> kinds of other stuff. But they didn't know what to call us with our instruments, so Capitol Records called us folksingers and gave us credit for starting this whole boom." ...|$|E

The Guardian ranked Bangerz thirty-fourth on their list of the forty best albums, commenting that it [...] " [...] people up for commercial, rather than transgressive, ends" [...] despite initially opining that [...] "the attention-seeking begins to grate". Rolling Stone placed Bangerz at number twenty-seven on their list of the fifty best albums, writing that Cyrus [...] " [...] depth and vulnerability to {{one hell of a}} party [...] <b>amid</b> <b>all</b> the foam-finger hub-hub". Ann Powers from NPR ranked the record tenth on her list of ten records, suggesting that it [...] "should earn her entry into every celebration of pop this year", while the Associated Press ranked it ninth for being [...] "banging".

500|$|The {{union of}} song and symphonic form in Mahler's music is, in Cooke's view, organic; [...] "his songs flower {{naturally}} into symphonic movements, being already symphonic in cast." [...] To Sibelius, Mahler expressed {{the belief that}} [...] "The symphony must be like the world. It must embrace everything." [...] True to this belief, Mahler drew material from many sources into his songs and symphonic works: bird calls and cow-bells to evoke nature and the countryside, bugle fanfares, street melodies and country dances to summon the lost world of his childhood. Life's struggles are represented in contrasting moods: the yearning for fulfilment by soaring melodies and chromatic harmony, suffering and despair by discord, distortion and grotesquerie. <b>Amid</b> <b>all</b> this is Mahler's particular hallmark—the constant intrusion of banality and absurdity into moments of deep seriousness, typified in the second movement of the Fifth Symphony when a trivial popular tune suddenly cuts into a solemn funeral march. The trite melody soon changes its character, and in due course re-emerges {{as one of the}} majestic Brucknerian chorales which Mahler uses to signify hope and the resolution of conflict. Mahler himself recognised the idiosyncrasies in his work, calling the Scherzo in the Third Symphony [...] "the most farcical {{and at the same time}} the most tragic piece that ever existed... It is as though all nature is making faces and sticking out its tongue." ...|$|E
500|$|Mike Higgins of The Independent {{deemed the}} episode [...] "a {{technical}} triumph", praising the [...] "smooth, almost flawless" [...] and [...] "fluent" [...] production. Shane Donaghey of The Belfast Telegraph {{also called the}} episode a [...] "triumph", opining {{that it could not}} possibly have lived up to the hype surrounding the storyline, but that transmitting live gave EastEnders [...] "an energy it normally lacks, with great violence, excellent direction". He summarised: [...] "the story gripped so well you forgot to look for the cock-ups, before a genuinely shocking denouement that you never saw coming <b>amid</b> <b>all</b> of the hype." [...] Pat Stacey of the Evening Herald felt that revealing Stacey as Archie's killer was [...] "a slight let-down" [...] and [...] "a little bit predictable", calling the episode [...] "a triumph of logistics over logic". However, Stacey wrote that aside from the [...] "damp-squib" [...] ending, [...] "EastEnders Live" [...] was [...] "surprisingly enjoyable [...] even for a committed 'Endersphobe like self." [...] She felt that transmitting live [...] "added a tangible layer of tension" [...] to proceedings, lamenting: [...] "If only EastEnders was this exciting all the time." [...] The Guardian Nancy Banks-Smith similarly felt that transmitting live made for [...] "tension, not clarity", commenting that bookmakers would be [...] "absolutely delighted" [...] with the outcome, but that viewers would be [...] "incredulous". [...] Cate Devine of The Herald was similarly critical, describing the episode as [...] "30 minutes of cheesy dramatic counterpoint", and highlighting the [...] "ropey lighting and poor sound effects." ...|$|E
