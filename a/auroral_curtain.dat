40|$|The aurora is {{understood}} {{as a manifestation of}} energy transfer and plasma transfer from the solar wind to the magnetosphere. The auroral oval seems to be a mapping of the boundary layer that lies just inside the magnetospheric surface, which consists of the magnetopause and neutral sheet. The auroral oval is consequently a region of reversal for the meridional component of the magnetospheric convection electric field and thus a region of strong shear in the plasma drift velocity field. The velocity shear seems to account for the formation of eddies in the <b>auroral</b> <b>curtain.</b> Moreover, the kinematical impedance associated with hot auroral plasma in magnetic mirror geometry makes it impossible for the reversal of the perpendicular (meridional) electric field across a narrow region of latitude to occur without the formation of a large parallel electric field...|$|E
40|$|The Io {{footprint}} (IFP) {{consists of}} one or several spots observed in both jovian hemispheres and {{is related to the}} electromagnetic interaction between Io and the magnetosphere. These spots are followed by an <b>auroral</b> <b>curtain,</b> called the tail, extending more than 90 ° longitude in the direction of planetary rotation. We use recent Hubble Space Telescope images of Jupiter to analyze the location of the footprint spots and tail as a function of Io's location in the jovian magnetic field. We present here a new IFP reference contour [...] -the locus of all possible IFP positions [...] -with an unprecedented accuracy, especially in previously poorly covered sectors. We also demonstrate that the lead angle - the longitudinal shift between Io and the actual IFP position - is not a reliable quantity for validation of the interaction models. Instead, the evolution of the inter-spot distances appears to be a better diagnosis of the Io-Jupiter interaction. Moreover, we present observations of the tail vertical profiles as seen above the limb. The emission peak altitude is ~ 900 km and remains relatively constant with the distance from the main spot. The altitudinal extent of the vertical emission profiles is not compatible with precipitation of a mono-energetic electron population. The best fit is obtained for a kappa distribution with a characteristic energy of ~ 70 eV and a spectral index of 2. 3. The broadness of the inferred electron energy spectrum gives insight into the physics of the electron acceleration mechanism at play above the IFP tail. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The H 3 + {{infrared}} aurorae of Saturn were analysed {{using the}} Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) to produce two {{studies of the}} emission above the limb. The first, following Stallard et al. (2012 a), was {{a case study of}} the peak altitude of the southern auroral emission above the limb. The results showed that the measured peak emission altitude is dominated by the alignment of the <b>auroral</b> <b>curtain</b> with the limb, and that accounting for this alignment issue results in a peak intensity altitude of 1215 ± 119 km above the 1 bar level. In the second study, a new projection technique mapped the H 3 + limb emissions with respect to latitude, altitude and local time. This technique enabled a statistical analysis of the average latitude-altitude structure of the auroral intensity, temperature and density using 511 observations from the years 2005 - 2010. For the northern auroral oval, the peak emission altitude was found to be 1333 ± 152 km above the 1 bar level, the average temperature for the peak emission layer was 549 − 12 + 34 K and the nadir column density was 1. 6 − 0. 9 + 3. 6 × 1015 m- 2. Likewise for the southern auroral oval, the peak emission altitude was 1225 ± 193 km, the average temperature was 585 − 29 + 6 K and the nadir column density was 6. 2 − 0. 3 + 0. 4 × 1015 m- 2. The peak emission latitude was found to be 74 º ± 1 º for both hemispheres, though the southern auroral emission was found to have a wider latitudinal distribution than the north. The north-south asymmetry in the magnetic field strength was used to explain the hemispheric differences in these properties. Pressure scale height analysis of H 3 + revealed that in both hemispheres, the H 3 + altitudinal distribution is controlled by its production and loss mechanisms and not gravity...|$|E
40|$|The Earth is {{constantly}} bombarded by energy from outerspace. Sunlight {{is the most}} visible and common example. Other parts of this bombardment are invisible, such as cos-mic rays, x-rays and atomic particles that stream out from the Sun in all directions.

25|$|The most {{distinctive}} and brightest are the curtain-like <b>auroral</b> arcs. Each <b>curtain</b> consists of many parallel rays, each {{lined up with}} the local direction of the magnetic field, consistent with auroras being shaped by Earth's magnetic field. In-situ particle measurements confirm that auroral electrons are guided by the geomagnetic field, and spiral around them while moving toward Earth. The similarity of an <b>auroral</b> display to <b>curtains</b> is often enhanced by folds within the arcs. Arcs can fragment or 'break-up' into separate, at times rapidly changing, often rayed features that may fill the whole sky. These are the 'discrete' auroras, which are at times bright enough to read a newspaper by at night. and can display rapid sub-second variations in intensity.|$|R
40|$|The aurora at Jupiter is a {{spectacular}} {{signature of the}} many processes {{taking place in the}} Jovian magnetosphere, such as magnetic reconnection, large scale electric currents, moon-magnetosphere interactions, etc. As a consequence, this aurora is extremely complex and dynamic, powered by a variety of phenomena that we have only begun to unravel. The 3 D morphology of the aurora can provide a way to untangle the different processes at play. As a polar orbiter, Juno will provide unprecedented global and close-up views of Jupiter’s auroral emissions. As it flies at low altitude over <b>auroral</b> <b>curtains,</b> spots and patches, it will provide views of these features from multiple points, allowing the retrieval of their 3 D structure. The ultraviolet spectrograph on board Juno (Juno-UVS) is designed to observe auroral emissions in the 68 to 210 nm range. It is equipped with a scan mirror targeting up to +/- 30 degrees off axis of the spacecraft rotation plane. We have built a planning tool to determine which auroral targets of interest, such as a satellite footprint for example, is observable by the instrument {{at any time during the}} mission. We have also built a simulation tool that allows us to generate realistic views of the Jovian aurora as observed by Juno-UVS. The purpose of this tool is to 1) fine-tune the selection algorithm to identify the most valuable data in the harsh radiation environment encountered around Jupiter, and 2) serve as a test bed for adapting tomographic algorithms to the Juno-UVS dataset. Tomographic reconstruction will allow estimation of the position and horizontal extent of the auroral regions of interest, as well as their vertical emission structure, which may be used to characterize the energy distribution of the precipitating particles responsible for the features...|$|R

Diffuse auroras are often composed of patches whose brightness exhibits regular or near-regular pulsations. The pulsation period can be typically many seconds, so is not always obvious. Often there black aurora i.e. narrow regions in diffuse aurora with reduced luminosity. A typical auroral display consists of these forms appearing in the above order throughout the night.|$|R
