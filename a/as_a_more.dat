5|$|A {{promotion}} came in c. 46, when Alexander {{was appointed}} procurator of Judea by Claudius. The province {{had returned to}} direct Roman rule only {{after the death of}} Agrippa in 44, and the tenure of Alexander's predecessor Cuspius Fadus had been marked by unrest, so Alexander's Jewish background may have marked him <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> acceptable governor. Less trouble is attested during his office, although he did condemn James and Simon, sons of an earlier rebel named Judas of Galilee, to crucifixion. It was also at this time that Judea was afflicted by a severe famine. In 48 he was succeeded by Ventidius Cumanus.|$|E
5|$|Additional subfamilies {{have been}} named for more fragmentary genera, {{including}} Aublysodontinae and Deinodontinae. However, the genera Aublysodon and Deinodon are usually considered nomina dubia, so they and their eponymous subfamilies are usually excluded from taxonomies of tyrannosaurids. An additional tyrannosaurid, Raptorex, was initially described <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> primitive tyrannosauroid, but likely represents a juvenile tyrannosaurine similar to Tarbosaurus. However, {{as it is known}} only from a juvenile specimen, it is also currently considered a nomen dubium.|$|E
5|$|As England imposed its {{series of}} acts upon the colonists, {{changes in the}} American colonists' {{purchases}} and trades eventually altered the American diet. Starting with the Molasses Act of 1733, followed by the Sugar Act of 1760, a shift in alcohol consumption occurred. This {{was more than a}} protest against taxation of molasses, the main ingredient in rum production. Whiskey became the spirit of choice for many American colonists who wished to thumb their noses at England. In the northern colonies, whiskey was made with rye, while the southern colonies preferred corn. Rye was seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> civilized grain, while corn whiskey was presented <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> patriotic version as it was produced from an indigenous American crop.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{aircraft}} {{industry as a}} whole was becoming increasingly interested in VTOL aircraft. It was expected that any future European war would start with a nuclear exchange that would destroy most airbases, so aircraft would need to operate from limited airbases, roads or even unprepared fields. Considerable research effort was put into various solutions to securing a second-strike capability. Some of these solutions included rocket-launched aircraft like the zero-length launch concept, while many companies started work on VTOL aircraft <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> appropriate long-term solution.|$|E
5|$|Both Lowell and Sexton {{encouraged}} Plath {{to write}} from her experience {{and she did}} so. She openly discussed her depression with Lowell and her suicide attempts with Sexton, who led her to write from a more female perspective. Plath began to conceive of herself <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> serious, focused poet and short-story writer. At this time Plath and Hughes first met the poet W. S. Merwin, who admired their work and was to remain a lifelong friend. Plath resumed psychoanalytic treatment in December, working with Ruth Beuscher.|$|E
5|$|Fleming {{developed}} the James Bond character more in Goldfinger {{than in the}} previous six novels, presenting him <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> complex individual, whilst also bringing out a theme of Bond as Saint George.

5|$|For {{various reasons}} it was {{impossible}} to apply some of the terms of the Act. Less eligibility was in some cases impossible without starving paupers and the high cost of building workhouses incurred by rate payers meant that outdoor relief continued to be a popular alternative. Despite efforts to ban outdoor relief, parishes continued to offer it <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> cost-effective method of dealing with pauperism. The Outdoor Labour Test Order and Outdoor Relief Prohibitory Order were both issued to try to prevent people receiving relief outside of the workhouse.|$|E

The new features produced a closer juxtaposition of architectural components, visible <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> crowded decoration, {{as can be seen}} in the Mallikarjuna Temple at Sudi in the Gadag district and the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri in the Dharwad district.|$|E

5|$|In 1971, Balabushka met Penndel, Pennsylvania native Gus Szamboti at a tournament. Szamboti {{had been}} working for RCA as a {{draftsman}} and designer, but RCA layoffs were common at the time, and he had started designing and selling pool cues <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> stable job path. Though he too started production with Titlist blanks as well as blanks manufactured by WICO of Chicago, Szamboti later began making his own. Balabushka was very impressed with Szamboti's blanks and, in addition to the two men becoming fast friends, he became Szamboti's first customer, buying blanks from him for $18 apiece.|$|E
5|$|Like the original, Drakengard 2 {{combines}} on-foot hack and slash with aerial combat {{stages and}} RPG game mechanics. The previous game's producer, writer and character designer {{returned to their}} respective roles. The game was designed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> mainstream game {{in light of the}} previous game's dark aesthetic and story. The game sold 206,000 copies by the end of 2005. Western reviews praised the story, but gave mixed opinions about the graphics and widely criticized the gameplay. A spin-off from the series, Nier, was released in 2010, while a third entry in the series, Drakengard 3, was released in December 2013 in Japan and May 2014 in North America and Europe.|$|E

5|$|The NDH {{government}} struck {{upon the}} idea of trying to re-educate these children to become something akin to an Ustaše version of the Hitler Youth, thereby turning them against their Serb parents. The regime saw this <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> effective way of placing pressure on the Yugoslav Partisan movement than killing the children outright. However, the NDH regime had not made any arrangements to implement this idea, so {{the establishment of a}} children's camp was done in haste, especially as there was strong pressure to do something for the children. NDH regime propaganda advanced the idea that the children were being liberated from slavery {{at the hands of the}} Partisans.|$|E
5|$|The Venus Express probe {{has shown}} through stellar {{occultation}} that the atmospheric haze extends much further {{up on the}} night side than the day side. On the day side the cloud deck has a thickness of 20km and extends up to about 65km, whereas on the night side the cloud deck {{in the form of}} a thick haze reaches up to 90km in altitude—well into mesosphere, continuing even further to 105km <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> transparent haze.
