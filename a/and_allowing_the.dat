5|$|In 1985, the New York City Health Department {{ordered that}} the city's gay bathhouses be closed. As a result, {{heterosexual}} sex clubs such as Plato's Retreat had {{to shut down}} as well because the city had just passed a gay rights ordinance, <b>and</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> heterosexual clubs to remain open while closing the gay establishments {{would have been a}} violation of that ordinance.|$|E
5|$|Therapeutic {{decompression}} is {{a procedure}} for treating decompression sickness by recompressing the diver, thus reducing bubble size, <b>and</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> gas bubbles to re-dissolve, then decompressing slowly {{enough to avoid}} further formation or growth of bubbles, or eliminating the inert gases by breathing oxygen under pressure.|$|E
5|$|A second {{competing}} {{theory for}} extratropical cyclone development over the oceans is the Shapiro-Keyser model, developed in 1990. Its main {{differences with the}} Norwegian Cyclone Model are the fracture of the cold front, treating warm-type occlusions and warm fronts as the same, <b>and</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> cold front to progress through the warm sector perpendicular to the warm front. This model was based on oceanic cyclones and their frontal structure, as seen in surface observations and in previous projects which used aircraft to determine the vertical structure of fronts across the northwest Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|Advanced Gemini is {{a number}} of {{proposals}} that would have extended the Gemini program {{by the addition of}} various missions, including manned low Earth orbit, circumlunar and lunar landing missions. Gemini was the second manned spaceflight program operated by NASA, and consisted of a two-seat spacecraft capable of maneuvering in orbit, docking with unmanned spacecraft such as Agena Target Vehicles, <b>and</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> crew to perform tethered extra-vehicular activities.|$|E
5|$|After {{numerous}} proposals {{the sand}} hills rear {{and north of}} the fort were removed in 1882, improving the fort's land defence <b>and</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> 64-pounder guns to sweep the Semaphore jetty. This now levelled area {{was used as a}} bivouac and exercise area for the colony's volunteer troops. A stable, office, shed and gunner's store were also erected north of the fort. The gunner's shed was damaged by fire in 1895 and replaced further eastward. These buildings did not survive into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Bethesda's Todd Howard first {{confirmed}} during E3 2008 that downloadable content (DLC) {{would be}} prepared for the Xbox 360 and Windows versions of Fallout 3. There are five DLCs: Operation: Anchorage, The Pitt, Broken Steel, Point Lookout, and Mothership Zeta, released in that order. Of the five, Broken Steel has the largest effect on the game, altering the ending <b>and</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> player to continue playing past the end of the main quest line.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge's front {{regiment}} was the 10th Kentucky Mounted Rifles, {{under the}} command of Col. Benjamin Caudill. Caudill's men dismounted and fired into the Union cavalry, inflicting minor casualties. As the rest of Breckinridge's troops began to arrive on the scene, Stoneman's soldiers secured elevated positions overlooking the river. Breckinridge observed that these hills were the best defensive positions in the area, ordering his front regiments to eliminate Union resistance on the hills. The rest of Giltner's Brigade also joined in the charge, routing the Union soldiers <b>and</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> Confederate forces to use the defensive positions themselves.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the limited}} {{interface}} of the 3DS, {{as well as to}} take advantage of the touch screen, 3D has vastly unique controls when compared to other games in the Metal Gear series. While the game has been heavily criticized for these control changes, use of the Circle Pad Pro peripheral has been cited to alleviate much of the control issues of the 3DS. This is done by restoring camera movement to the second analog stick, adding ZL and ZR buttons for aiming and attacking, <b>and</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> face buttons to be used in a manner more in line with all other releases in the Metal Gear series.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{internal}} heat {{comes from}} a combination of residual heat from planetary accretion (about 20%) and heat produced through radioactive decay (80%). The major heat-producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232. At the center, the temperature may be up to , and the pressure could reach 360GPa. Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately , twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, <b>and</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today.|$|E

5|$|Galvani's friend, Alessandro Volta, {{continued}} {{researching the}} effect and invented the Voltaic pile in 1800. The basic unit of Volta's pile was a simplified galvanic cell, made of plates of copper and zinc separated by an electrolyte and {{connected by a}} conductor externally. The units were stacked in series to make the Voltaic cell, which produced electricity by directing electrons from the zinc to the copper <b>and</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> zinc to corrode.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1951, 500,000 Chinese troops {{attacked}} the Eighth Army's {{line at the}} Imjin River, forcing it back 50 miles <b>and</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> Chinese to capture Seoul. The 24th Infantry Division was then reassigned to IX Corps to replace the 2nd and 25th Infantry Divisions, which {{had been placed in}} reserve due to heavy losses. The Chinese eventually advanced too far for their supply lines to adequately support them, and their attack stalled.|$|E

5|$|On 13–14 May, German forces {{crossed the}} Meuse near Sedan using {{integrated}} land and air tactics {{that broke the}} morale of the French 55th Infantry Division, driving them out of the blockhouse line <b>and</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> Germans to gain a strong position from which to exploit the breakthrough. A progressive collapse of the French Second and Ninth Armies from 14 May to 17 May allowed German forces to move to the west of La Ferté, cutting La Ferté off from much of its mobile support.|$|E
5|$|On April 2, The World's Greatest Tag Team was {{unsuccessful}} in defeating {{the team of}} Ric Flair and Carlito, but defeated them in a rematch on April 16 when Haas distracted Carlito, allowing Benjamin to gain the win. They won again two weeks later when Carlito turned on Flair, attacking him <b>and</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>The</b> World's Greatest Tag Team to win via countout. They then challenged the Hardy Boyz for the World Tag Team Championship at One Night Stand in a ladder match, but were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The HV and HVO {{launched}} Operation Southern Move in response, {{removing the}} VRS pressure from Ključ <b>and</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> 5th Corps, {{reinforced by the}} 7th Corps, to resume its advance and capture Sanski Most on 12 October, by which time a comprehensive ceasefire was to come into effect throughout the country. Combat continued for another eight days without significant changes to the frontlines. Fighting did not resume, and the war ended the following month following negotiation and acceptance of the Dayton Agreement.|$|E

5|$|When Harding {{ran for the}} Republican {{nomination}} for president in 1920 he was considered a long shot until after the convention began. Then the leading candidates, such as General Leonard Wood, could not gain the needed majority, and the convention deadlocked. Harding's support gradually grew until he was nominated on the 10th ballot. He conducted a front porch campaign, remaining {{for the most part}} in Marion <b>and</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>the</b> people to come to him. He won in a landslide over Democrat James M. Cox and Socialist Party candidate Eugene Debs, running on a theme of return to normalcy and becoming the first sitting senator to be elected president.|$|E
