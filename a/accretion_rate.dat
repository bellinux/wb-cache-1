However, the mass <b>accretion</b> <b>rates</b> derived from the X-ray observations are consistently lower than those derived from UV/optical/NIR studies. We aim {{to test the hypothesis}} that the high density soft X-ray emission is from accretion by analysing optical accretion tracers from an X-ray selected sample of CTTSs in a homogeneous manner. We analyse optical spectra of a sample of CTTSs and calculate the <b>accretion</b> <b>rates</b> based on measuring optical emission lines. These are then compared to the <b>accretion</b> <b>rates</b> derived from the X-ray spectroscopy. We find that, for each CTTS in our sample, the different optical tracers predict mass <b>accretion</b> <b>rates</b> that agree within the errors, albeit with a spread of ~ 1 order of magnitude.

500|$|Furthermore, the hailstone’s speed {{depends on}} its {{position}} in the cloud’s updraft and its mass. [...] This determines the varying thicknesses of the layers of the hailstone. [...] The <b>accretion</b> <b>rate</b> of supercooled water droplets onto the hailstone depends on the relative velocities between these water droplets and the hailstone itself.

The final mass of an oligarch depends on the distance from the star and surface density of planetesimals and is called the isolation mass. For the rocky planets it is up to , or one Mars mass.

Objective & design: To acquire this information, we collected abdominal subcutaneous WAT samples from 40 preterm and term fetuses. Their GA ranged from 22 to 43 weeks. FA were expressed as mg/g wet WAT and g/ 100 g FA (g%). Intrauterine WAT FA <b>accretion</b> <b>rates</b> were estimated for appropriate (AGA) and large (LGA) for gestational age infants. Results: From 25 to 40 weeks gestation, saturated-FA (SAFA) increased from 83 to 298 mg/g WAT and monounsaturated-FA (MUFA) from 83 to 226 mg/g WAT, while polyunsaturated-FA (PUFA) increased insignificantly from 18. 0 to 23. 2 mg/g WAT. As percentages of total FA, SAFA increased from 46 to 55 g%, MUFA decreased from 44 to 41 g%, and PUFA from 10. 3 to 4. 26 g%. Docosahexaenoic (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA) <b>accretion</b> <b>rates</b> in WAT during the 3 rd trimester for AGA infants were 88 and 193 mg/week, respectively.

We focus on the early Class I stage of stellar evolution when circumstellar disks are exposed to high rates of mass deposition from infalling envelopes. Our numerical modeling reproduces the large observed spread in <b>accretion</b> <b>rates</b> inferred for embedded YSOs in Perseus, Serpens, and Ophiuchus star forming regions by Enoch et al.

Although <b>accretion</b> <b>rates</b> and the resulting surface elevation change largely determine the resilience of salt marshes to sea-level rise (SLR), the effect of livestock grazing on <b>accretion</b> <b>rates</b> has been little studied. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of livestock grazing on salt-marsh <b>accretion</b> <b>rates.</b> We hypothesise that accretion will be lower in grazed compared to ungrazed salt marshes. In four study sites along the mainland coast of the Wadden Sea (in the south-eastern North Sea), <b>accretion</b> <b>rates,</b> sediment deposition rates, and soil compaction of grazed and ungrazed marshes were analysed using the Cs- 137 radionuclide dating method. <b>Accretion</b> <b>rates</b> were on average 11. 6 mm yr(- 1) during recent decades and thus higher than current and projected rates of SLR. Neither accretion nor sediment deposition rates were significantly different between grazing treatments. Meanwhile, soil compaction was clearly affected by grazing with significantly higher dry bulk density on grazed compared to ungrazed parts. Based on these results, we conclude that other factors influence whether grazing has an effect on accretion and sediment deposition rates and that the effect of grazing on marsh growth does not follow a direct causal chain.

Comparison with other regions suggests that the TO observed at different ages do not necessarily represent the same type of objects, which is consistent {{with the fact that the}} different processes that can lead to reduced IR excess/inner disk clearing (e. g., binarity, dust coagulation/settling, photoevaporation, giant planet formation) do not operate on the same timescales. Accreting TO in Tr 37 are probably suffering strong dust coagulation/settling. Regarding the equally large number of non-accreting TO in the region, other processes, like photoevaporation, the presence of stellar/substellar companions, and/or giant planet formation may account for their "transitional" SEDs and negligible <b>accretion</b> <b>rates.</b> Comment: 37 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables Accepted by Ap...|$|R
