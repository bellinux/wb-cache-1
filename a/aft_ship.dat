50|$|The {{weaponry}} {{lacked a}} specific anti-ship missiles system, except the AS-12.

There was not a real CIWS system on board, relating only to the massive firepower of artilleries, but at <b>aft</b> <b>ship</b> none of them can fire, so despite so many guns, there were still blind spots in the defence at low altitudes, covered (in the aft sector) only by Tartar/SM-1, not meant as anti-missile system.|$|E

40|$|Shallow water effects {{change the}} flow around a ship {{significantly}} which {{can affect the}} optimum design of the hull. This paper describes a study into the optimization of the <b>aft</b> <b>ship</b> region for various water depths. The research focuses on variations of the following parameters of a hull form: The athwart ship’s propeller location, the tunnel top curvature, the flat-of-bottom shape in the stern region and the stern bilge radius. All hull form variants are valuated in 3 different water depths using a viscous flow solver, and a surrogate model is created for each water depth. Pareto plots are used to present the trade-off between the optimization for one or another water depth. Finally, specific hull forms are chosen and the differences in flow behavior among hull forms and water depths are explained. Ship Design, Production and Operation...|$|E
40|$|MATLAB (matrix laboratory) is a multi-paradigm {{numerical}} computing {{programming language}} {{which has a}} simple to use graphical user interface and can interface with programs written in other programming languages such as C, Java and FORTRAN.

In this study, we developed a program which can visualize the motion of a ship that is recovering buoys or fishing gear from the sea. We also assessed the usefulness of this program for an actual ship maneuvering test involving the fishing ship Kakuyo Maru, Faculty of Fisheries, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{concerns a}} ship whereby the hull and the mechanical propulsion device are designed {{such that the}} Froude number is larger than 0. 5. In the <b>aft</b> <b>ship</b> the hull has a bottom with V-shaped bottom surfaces with a deadrise angle that is less than 40 degrees and the hull has substantially vertical sides. In the hull are a passenger compartment and a trim tank. The trim tank volume is such that {{the weight of a}} filled trim tank is more than 30 % of the weight of displacement of the hull with an empty trim tank, filling the trim tank with water increases the amidships immersed width with at least 10 %, and the bottom surfaces (15) have bilge keels (13, 26) fully immersed when the trim tank is filled with water and the bilge keels are at least in part above the water level when the trim tank is empty.

40|$|Within {{the work}} {{packages}} I+II {{of the development}} of a big inland going sea ship, the preliminary design for a container vessel / general cargo ship and for a liquefied-gas carrier was worked out. With a draught of 3, 5 m respectively 3, 0 m both units have higher dead-weight than existing Rhine - sea - ships. The container vessel has a length less than 100 m and a breadth of 17, 20 m. The stowage of 6 containers in width is possible. The total container capacity amounts 256 TEUs in 4 layers (2 layers on deck). Due to the relatively large breadth the ship was designed as twin-screw vessel. The gas carrier has nearly the recently approved maximum length of 135 m for the river Rhine. The ship was designed as gas carrier for liquefied gas under pressure in separate pressure tanks. The two ships have relatively high stability. Sufficient ballast water capacity is available, in order to improve the seaworthiness under worse weather conditions. A numerical optimisation of the hull-form was carried out for the container vessel. Principally it could be shown, that shifting the centre of buoyancy ahead maintaining the same blockcoefficient, that means a slender <b>aft</b> <b>ship</b> in connection with a fuller fore body, results in a decrease of wave resistance.

40|$|The aim of a. m. R and D-project was the {{development}} of a fast monohull passenger ferry, which has to be operated in the south East Asian island archipel. The spin shall be able to convey abt. 1000 people with a service speed of 40 knots. The main intention for designing a. m. vessel was their economical operation, that means, if possible, the transportation of a maximal number of people with maximum speed at a minimum fuel consumption as well as short berthing times. Another aspects was a short building time of the ship. This resulted subsequently in several design main items. The first was to find ways for a consequent reduction of weight of the structure. This had been realized by using high strength aluminium alloys. In wide areas, where possible, aluminium extrusion profiles were used. Therefore, a set of four similar profiles, stiffened acc. to expected loads, was developped. An entire strength calculation, perfromed by GL showed the feasability of building the structure planned by FLW. Moreover, statical and dynamical strength analysis with means of a finite element model had been carried out, whereas the model had been refined for <b>aft</b> <b>ship</b> strength calculation. The second design aspect was to achieve a high passenger comfort, despite the small size of the vessel compared to its passenger capacity, which required another great effort of designing work.
