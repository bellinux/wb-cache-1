Dental professionals were recruited during the 2010 Michigan Dental Association <b>Annual</b> Convention. <b>Mercury</b> levels in hair and urine samples were analyzed as biomarkers of methylmercury and elemental mercury exposure, respectively.

40|$|The {{allocation}} of resources to male or female progeny, or to male or female reproductive function more generally, {{is one of the}} most important life history decisions a sexually reproducing individual must ever make. Sex determination is thus a fundamental process, yet the mechanisms which control it are surprisingly diverse. In this thesis, I examine sex determination in the plant species Mercurialis annua L. (Euphorbiaceae). I assess the mechanism of sex determination operating in dioecious and androdioecious populations of M. annua and also investigate the conservation and evolution of sex-determining mechanisms across the <b>annual</b> <b>mercury</b> clade, the lineages of which display exceptional variation in sexual system. First, using crosses, I establish that sex in dioecious M. annua is controlled by a single-locus genetic mechanism, consistent with recent work that identified a single male-linked DNA marker in the species. My search for new sex-linked genes revealed none, however, suggesting that M. annua possesses at most a small non-recombining region around sex-determining loci. Why many dioecious plants lack heteromorphic sex chromosomes is still poorly understood and I consider explanations for this. I extend my investigation by comparing genetic diversity between loci that differ in their linkage to the sex-determining locus. I find a single male-linked marker to possess significantly lower diversity than autosomal loci, but no difference in the diversity of partially sex-linked and non-sex-linked genes. I also assess the conservation of a sex-linked marker among <b>annual</b> <b>mercury</b> lineages and conduct crosses between lineages to examine the conservation of sex determination. My findings indicate a conserved mechanism of single-locus genetic sex determination and I consider the role polyploidisation and hybridisation have played in sexual system evolution and the modification of sex-determining mechanisms in the clade. Finally, I assess the presence of environmental sex determination in androdioecious M. annua, concluding that although male frequency is not influenced by growing density, a degree of sexual lability exists in the lineage.

40|$|Our {{knowledge}} {{of the distribution of}} mercury concentrations in air of the Southern Hemisphere was until recently based mostly on intermittent measurements made during ship cruises. In the last few years continuous mercury monitoring has commenced at several sites in the Southern Hemisphere, providing new and more refined information. In this paper we compare mercury measurements at several remote sites in the Southern Hemisphere made over a period of at least 1 year at each location. Averages of monthly medians show similar although small seasonal variations at both Cape Point and Amsterdam Island. A pronounced seasonal variation at Troll research station in Antarctica is due to frequent mercury depletion events in the austral spring. Due to large scatter and large standard deviations of monthly average median mercury concentrations at Cape Grim, no systematic seasonal variation could be found there. Nevertheless, the <b>annual</b> average <b>mercury</b> concentrations at all sites during the 2007 – 2013 period varied only between 0. 85 and 1. 05 ng m − 3. Part of this variability is likely due to systematic measurement uncertainties which we propose can be further reduced by improved calibration procedures. We conclude that mercury is much more uniformly distributed throughout the Southern Hemisphere than the distributions suggested by measurements made onboard ships. This finding implies that smaller trends can be detected in shorter time periods. We also report a change in the trend sign at Cape Point from decreasing mercury concentrations in 1996 – 2004 to increasing concentrations since 2007...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOur {{understanding}} of Mercury's sodium exosphere has improved considerably {{in the last}} 5 years thanks to new observations (Schleicher et al. 2004) and to {{the publication of a}} summary of the large set of ground based observations (Potter et al. 2008; 2007; 2009). In particular, the non-uniformity in longitude of the dayside sodium distribution (the dawn/dusk asymmetry) has now been clearly observed. This suggests that Mercury's sodium exosphere is partly driven by a global day to night side migration of the volatiles. One of the key questions remaining {{is the nature of the}} prevailing sodium ejection mechanisms. Because of the uncertain parameters for each ejection mechanisms, solving this problem has been difficult as indicated by the numerous papers over the last 15 years with very different conclusions. In addition, the variation of the size and of the spatial distribution of the surface reservoir (Leblanc and Johnson, 2003) varies with distance from the sun affecting the importance of each ejection mechanism on Mercury's orbital position We here present an updated version of the Leblanc and Johnson (2003) model. We take into account the two populations of sodium in the surface reservoir (Hunten et al. 1988), one ambient population (physisorbed in the regolith with low binding energy) and one source population (chemisorbed coming from grain interior or from fresh dust brought to the surface and characterized by a higher binding energy). We also incorporate a better description of the solar wind sputtering variation with solar conditions. The results of a large number of simulations of the sodium exosphere are compared with the measured <b>annual</b> cycle of <b>Mercury</b> sodium emission brightness. These measurements were obtained from the published data by Potter et al. (2007) as well as from our own data obtained during the last two years using THEMIS solar telescope. These data show that: the annual cycle in the emission brightness is roughly the same from one year to another; there are significant discrepancies between what would be observed if the exospheric content were constant; and t the <b>annual</b> cycle of <b>Mercury's</b> sodium exosphere strongly depends on its position in its orbit so that there are seasons in Mercury's exosphere. Based on these comparisons we derived the principal signatures for each ejection mechanism during a Mercury year and show that none of the ejection mechanisms dominates over the whole year. Rather, particular features of the annual cycle of the sodium intensity appear to be induced by one, temporarily dominant, ejection mechanism. Based on this analysis, we are able to roughly explain the <b>annual</b> cycle of <b>Mercury's</b> exospheric sodium emission brightness. We also derive a set of parameters defining those ejection mechanisms which best reproduce this cycle. For our best case, Mercury's exosphere content varies from not, vert, similar 1. 6 ± 0. 1 × 10 28 Na atoms at TAA = 140 ° and 70 ° respectively to not, vert, similar 4. 5 ± 0. 3 × 10 28 Na atoms at TAA = 180 ° and 0 °. In addition, Mercury's exospheric surface reservoir contains not, vert, similar 1 × 10 31 Na atoms at TAA = 300 ° and at TAA = 170 ° with up to three times more sodium atoms trapped in Mercury's nightside than in its dayside surface...|$|R

Preliminary simulation was performed {{by the use of}} the Excel tool with measured mercury concentrations in the water and air of the Gulf of Trieste area. Modelling simulations were performed by a three-dimensional baroclinic mathematical model PCFLOW 3 D. Both calculations are based on Wanninkhof's gas exchange model (GEM). The PCFLOW 3 D model consists of modules which can calculate hydrodynamics, transport and dispersion of suspended sediment including resuspension and transport as well as the dispersion of mercury in its dissolved and particulate forms. In the biogeochemical module we can simulate some transformation processes. The exchange with the bottom sediment and the atmosphere, methylation, demethylation, reduction and oxidation can be taken into account.

Moreover, we wanted to quantify the annual GEM flux, identify the controls, and compare the GEM flux to annual rates of gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM) dry deposition and wet deposition of total mercury. We measured GEM fluxes using the modified Bowen ratio (MBR) technique from 6 July 2009 to 6 July 2010 in western Maryland. The annual hourly mean (±std. dev.) GEM flux was − 0. 63 ± 31. 0 ng·m− 2 ·h− 1. Hourly mean GEM fluxes were not strongly correlated with atmospheric trace gases, aerosols, or meteorology. However, hourly mean GEM emissions (15. 3 ± 27. 9 ng·m− 2 ·h− 1) and deposition (− 14. 6 ± 26. 6 ng·m− 2 ·h− 1) were correlated with ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B), wind speed (WS), ozone (O 3), and relative humidity (RH). The annual net GEM flux was − 3. 33 µg· m− 2 ·year− 1 and was similar to the annual dry deposition rate of GOM (2. 5 to 3. 2 µg·m− 2 ·year− 1), and 40 % less than the annual mean wet deposition (8 µg·m− 2 ·year− 1) of total mercury.

Recently, there are concerns for the long-range transport of mercury from East Asia to North America, which may lead to enhanced dry and wet depositions in North America. In this study, we performed four monthly simulations (January, April, July and October in 2005) using CMAQ-Hg v 4. 6 in an East Asian model domain. Coupled with a mass balance analysis {{and a number of}} emission inventory scenarios, the chemical transport of atmospheric mercury, the seasonal mercury transport budgets and mercury emission outflow from the East Asian region were investigated. The total <b>annual</b> <b>mercury</b> deposition in the region for the modeling year is estimated to be 821 Mg, with 396 Mg contributed by wet deposition and 425 Mg contributed by dry deposition. Regional mercury transport budgets show strong seasonal variability, with a net removal of RGM (7 ~ 5 Mg mo&minus; 1 ) and PHg (13 ~ 21 Mg mo&minus; 1 ), and a net export of GEM (60 ~ 130 Mg mo&minus; 1 ) from the study domain. The annual outflow caused by the East Asian emission is estimated to be in the range of 1369 ~ 1671 Mg yr&minus; 1 , primarily in the form of GEM.

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of mild hypertension {{and the treatment}} of hypertension require accurate measurement of blood pressure. Blood pressure readings are altered by various factors that influence the patient, the techniques used and {{the accuracy of the}} sphygmomanometer. The variability of readings can be reduced if informed patients prepare in advance by emptying their bladder and bowel, by avoiding over-the-counter vasoactive drugs the day of measurement and by avoiding exposure to cold, caffeine consumption, smoking and physical exertion within half an hour before measurement. The use of standardized techniques to measure blood pressure will help to avoid large systematic errors. Poor technique can account for differences in readings of more than 15 mm Hg and ultimately misdiagnosis. Most of the recommended procedures are simple and, when routinely incorporated into clinical practice, require little additional time. The equipment must be appropriate and in good condition.

The Gulf is subject to substantial Hg pollution, originating from the So˘ca river, that drains the cinnabar deposits of the world’s second largest Hg mining area, Idrija, Slovenia. The Gulf belongs {{to one of the}} most polluted areas in the Mediterranean. Apart from Hg problems, the Gulf is also a subject to industrial and sewage pollution. Due to deteriorating water quality in the Gulf there is a great concern that Hg can be remobilized from sediments to the water column as well as enhance methylation rates which may consequently increase already elevated Hg levels in aquatic organisms. The paper presents data from a recent study which aims to assess the extent of contamination of the Gulf of Trieste after the closure of the Hg mine. Mercury and methylmercury were measured in various environmental compartments estuarine and marine waters, sediments, and organisms. during the period 1995] 1997. Data obtained show that even 10 years after closure of the Hg mine, Hg concentrations in river sediments and water are still very high and did not show the expected decrease of Hg in the Gulf of Trieste. A provisional <b>annual</b> <b>mercury</b> mass balance was established for the Gulf of Trieste showing that the major source of inorganic mercury is still the River Soca Isonzo. while the major source of methylmercury is the bottom sediment of the Gulf...|$|E
40|$|Mercury is {{a potent}} neurotoxin of concern to humans and wildlife. Historic gold and mercury mining districts in the Sierra Nevada and Coast Range Mountains (California, USA), in {{addition}} to expanding urbanization in the Central Valley, are ongoing sources of mercury to San Francisco Bay. The large magnitude of runoff and associated sediment entering the Bay through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta makes Delta outflow an important transport pathway for mercury and other particle-associated contaminants. From WY 2002 to WY 2006, water sampling and continuous monitoring of suspended sediment concentrations were performed at the landward boundary of the Bay to quantify mercury concentrations and loads associated with storm events. Mercury concentrations ranged from 3. 2 to 25 ng/L and showed a strong correlation (r 2 = 0. 8) to suspended sediment concentrations. The collection of continuous turbidity measurements allowed for extrapolation of the suspended sediment record to estimate daily average total mercury loads. Daily mercury loads ranged from 3 to 13, 530 g, while <b>annual</b> <b>mercury</b> loads varied from a minimum of 61 ± 21 kg in WY 2002 {{to a maximum of}} 131 ± 45 kg in WY 2004. In January of 2006, a series of large storms, with a return frequency of about eight years for the biggest storm, caused high flows and widespread flooding. This high flow year will result in an annual load much larger than previously estimated. Samples collected during these high flows make this one of the most valuable datasets on loads to the Bay. Combined with information on other significant transport pathways, the data collected will assist in understanding the long-term recovery of San Francisco Bay from mercury contamination and will influence implementation of the Bay mercury TMDL.

40|$|Abstract. Substance Flow Analysis (SFA) is an {{approach}} showing {{main sources of}} emission and flows of pollution to the environment, which allows to define possible environmental risk. Total identified mercury emission to air, soil and water in Poland for year 2010 from anthropogenic sources was estimated as 18. 0 Mg. Annual Hg emission to air from by-product sources was equal 13. 5 Mg, with the highest share of emission from brown coal-fired power plants. Mercury contained in combustion residues and removed from flue gases is transferred to waste waters, disposed to landfills and used to a concrete production with unknown amounts. <b>Annual</b> <b>mercury</b> emission to air {{from the use of}} mercury-containing products (0. 5 Mg) was estimated by authors based on model for distribution and emissions for batteries, light sources, other electrical and electronic equipment and also for measuring and control equipment. Emission to air from dental practice (0. 3 Mg) was estimated for combustion of wastes containing dental amalgam and from bodies cremation. SFA for the use of mercury-containing products and dental practice presents significant load of 10. 4 Mg mercury contained in hazardous wastes produced annually. It covers wastes of used products, dental amalgam wastes directly from clinics as well as stream from incineration of infectious dental wastes. In the paper mercury discharges to water from large and medium industrial facilities (2. 9 Mg) and municipal waste-water treatment plants in large agglomerations (0. 4 Mg) are presented. Smaller loads are generates by leachate transfer from municipal landfills to WWTPs and further to agriculture and also by releases from dental amalgam in buried bodies. The paper indicates lack of information in SFA which should be regarded, mainly concerning mercury releases from municipal landfills to water and soil and emissions from municipal WWTPs to air...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn Doressoundiram et al. (Icarus, 2010), we {{presented}} and discussed {{two sets of}} observations of the Na/K ratio in Mercury's exosphere. These observations suggested that the different spatial distributions of Mercury's Na and K exospheres could help explain the anomalously large values of Na/K ratio observed at Mercury. In Leblanc and Johnson (Icarus 2010), we simulated the <b>annual</b> cycle of <b>Mercury's</b> sodium exosphere, emphasizing {{the importance of the}} day to night side migration of the sodium and the close relation between the content of the sodium exosphere and the content of the surface reservoir of adsorbed sodium. In this paper, the potassium exosphere is modelled using laboratory measurements to constrain the various ejection processes. The annual cycle of the exospheric potassium emission brightness is compared to the few available observations showing that our model provides a reasonable description of this exospheric component. A comparison with the best spatially resolved observation of Doressoundiram et al. (Icarus, 2010) highlights key features of the Na/K spatial distributions. It is essentially differences in global transport, the loss rate and the desorption efficiencies which account for the spatial distribution of the observed ratio. The Na/K ratio in the exosphere cannot be simply associated with the primary abundances but is closely related to the relative loss rates. Accounting for the transport and loss, the observed Na/K exospheric ratio may be consistent with an initial abundance close to solar or meteoritic ones...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} intends to {{increase}} the knowledge on the mobility of mercury in a salt marsh colonised by Halimione portulacoides. Mercury distribution in the sediment layers and its incorporation into the plant biomass were assessed, {{as well as the}} potential export of mercury from the contaminated area to the adjacent environment. Mercury pools in the sediments ranged from 560 to 943  mg m- 2 and are largely associated with the solid fraction, with just a small amount being associated with the pore waters. Estimated diffusive fluxes of reactive mercury ranged from 1. 3 to 103  ng m- 2  d- 1. Despite the above ground biomass values being comparatively higher than below ground biomass values, the mercury pools were much higher in the root system (0. 06 - 0. 16  mg m- 2 and 29 - 102  mg m- 2, respectively). The <b>annual</b> bioaccumulation of <b>mercury</b> in above ground tissues was estimated in 0. 11  mg m- 2  y- 1, while in below ground biomass the values were higher (72  mg m- 2  y- 1). The turnover rates of H. portulacoides biomass suggest higher mercury mobility within the plant rhizosphere. Taking into account the pools of mercury in above ground biomass, the export of mercury by macro-detritus following the "outwelling hypothesis" is not significant for the mercury balance in the studied ecosystem. The mercury accumulated in the below ground part of the plant is quite mobile, being able to return to the sediment pool throughout the mineralisation process. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation focuses on numeric modelling of sediment resuspension and transport {{as well as}} pollutant fluxes between the sediment, water and air. These processes {{are an important part}} of the mass balance of the sediments and pollutants in the aquatic environment. Sediment resuspension is influenced by sea currents and waves, in shallow bays also by maritime traffic. We developed a new model that calculates shear velocities at the sea bottom using information on navigation and the ship's characteristics. The existing three-dimensional mathematical model PCFLOW 3 D was upgraded with the interface to couple with the wave model SWAN. With it we performed numerous simulations in which we combined different sediment resuspension forcing factors: currents, waves, and navigation. The simulation results show that the most important factor in ordinary meteorological conditions is navigation since the bottom shear velocities were locally by an order of magnitude higher than the ones caused by other forcing factors. With the new model it is also possible to estimate the influence of different vessels on the bottom. In addition we measured the suspended sediments / studied the hysteresis effect on the river Idrijca and tried to estimate the transportation of mercury in the catchment of the Idrijca and the Soča towards the Gulf of Trieste. However, no reliable results could be obtained due to several organisational difficulties. With the use of the improved Gårdfeldt method and GEM we calculated the <b>annual</b> evasion of <b>mercury</b> in the Mediterranean Sea. The obtained high results compared with the results of other studies show that either the processes in the boundary layer, which have not yet been modelled, play a very important role in mercury evasion, or that there are large amounts of mercury in the Mediterranean that have so far not been discovered...|$|R
