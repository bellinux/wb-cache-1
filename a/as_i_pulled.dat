2500|$|Maluțan said, [...] "Then Stelica, the co-pilot, {{came to me}} {{and said}} that there were demonstrators coming to the terrace. Then the Ceaușescus came out, both {{practically}} carried by their bodyguards [...] [...] [...] They looked as if they were fainting. They were white with terror. Manea Mănescu [...] and Emil Bobu were running behind them. Mănescu, Bobu, Neagoe and another Securitate officer scrambled to the four seats in the back [...] [...] [...] <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> Ceaușescu in, I saw the demonstrators running across the terrace [...] [...] [...] There wasn't enough space, Elena Ceaușescu and I were squeezed in between the chairs and the door [...] [...] [...] We were only supposed to carry four passengers [...] [...] [...] We had six." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tut! I {{have not}} killed him. Dead {{men do not}} bite, and his cursed teeth met in my thumb <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> the sack over his head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! uncle," [...] exclaimed Pereira, [...] "did you {{see those}} birds cross each other <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled?</b> That was a lucky one for me, but I won't count the second if the Heer Allan objects." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no!" [...] I said. [...] "Perhaps {{we can do}} it all by ourselves. Wind {{the line}} quickly around the top of the stake <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> it in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have it {{your own}} way, Hurry; all I contend for is, that it's lucky. I dare say <b>I</b> shall not <b>pull</b> upon a human mortal as {{steadily}} or with as light a heart, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> upon a deer." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "On Sight" [...] {{contains}} a line stating: [...] "A monster {{about to come}} alive again / Soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> up and park the Benz / We get this bitch shaking like Parkinson's." [...] This line aroused controversy from the American Parkinson Disease Association. The group called the verse [...] "distasteful and the product of obvious ignorance." [...] MTV replied stating: [...] "The self-professed 'black new wave artist' {{is no stranger to}} controversial lyrics, drawing the ire of PETA for saying that his 'mink is draggin' on the floor' on last year's [...] "Cold", but APDA's outrage seems perfunctory considering that this isn't the first time a rapper has used the symptoms of Parkinson's disease for lyrical effect." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] the lock-keeper's {{wife was}} saying. [...] "As fast <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> to get 'im out, 'e crawled back. Then I called for 'elp, and some workmen 'appened along, {{and we got}} 'im out and turned 'im over to the constable." ...|$|E
60|$|Leaning {{over the}} side, with {{two pairs of}} gloves on, I caught the double line, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> and Dan reeled the fish came up nearer. But I could not see him. Then I reached the leader and held on as for dear life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] he answered, {{with his}} courteous {{intonation}} and a faint smile. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> a drawer open his suddenly aroused curiosity {{gave him a}} watchful expression. I wonder what he expected to see. A poem, maybe. All that's beyond guessing now.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will {{remember}} that, Father, if I {{ever have to}} disguise myself again," [...] Dick said. [...] "I feel <b>as</b> if <b>I</b> were <b>pulling</b> the whole skin off my face." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{thought this}} {{better and better}} still, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> began to <b>pull</b> on my hose, recalling the man's impudent mendicancy at Prestongrange's, I {{determined}} to pursue {{what seemed to be}} my victory.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hello Haught," [...] was my greeting, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> {{dismounted}} and <b>pulled</b> out my watch. [...] "I'm {{four hours}} and a quarter late. Sorry. I could have made it, but didn't {{want to leave the}} wagons." ...|$|R
60|$|Finally, {{and after}} what seemed to me a full ten minutes, I {{contrived}} to seize Job Lord by the arm, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> at the limb Archie {{was able to get}} a hold on his throat, thus, as can well be imagined, bringing the fight to an end.|$|E
6000|$|All that I knew at this {{shock of}} waking was that {{something}} was happening above. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> on my steaming mittens and hurried my best up the reeling stairs, I could hear the stamp of men's feet that for once were not lagging. In the chart-house hall I heard Mr. Pike, who had already covered {{the length of the}} bridge from the for'ard-house, shouting: ...|$|E
6000|$|... “When the ass {{had eaten}} his macaroon, I pressed {{him to come}} in. The poor beast was heavy loaded—his legs seemed to tremble under him—he hung rather backward, and, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> at his halter, it broke in my hand. He looked up pensive in my face: ‘Don’t thrash me with it: but if you will you may.’ ‘If I do,’ said I, ‘I’ll be d——.’ ” ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"Thirty pounds!" [...] he said, <b>as</b> though <b>I</b> had <b>pulled</b> a tooth of him. [...] "You talk {{as though}} thirty pounds {{was to be}} had for the asking. None the less," [...] he says, [...] "your draft's a fine piece of work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Plain robbing, Miss, that's all. I came {{snooping}} {{around to}} see what I could gather up. I thought you wan't to home, seein' <b>as</b> <b>I</b> saw you <b>pull</b> out with your old man in an auto. I reckon that must a ben your pa, and you're Miss Setliffe." ...|$|R
60|$|Hiram gave no heed <b>as</b> Archie and <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> {{the brave}} lad in; but was fumbling about {{in search of}} oars {{that it might be}} {{possible}} for him to guide the craft, and thus it was we were driven by the tempest from out the very midst of the Britishers where they must have been as thick as ants in a hill, although, fortunately for us, ill inclined to brave the fury of the blast in the open.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dick Darvall," [...] exclaimed Jackson, as {{the former}} rode up, [...] "I never was gladder to see any man than I am to see you this hour, though but for my Mary I'd surely have sent you to kingdom come. Her ears are better than mine, you see. She {{recognised}} the voice an' knocked up my rifle just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> the trigger. But I'm afeared it's too late, lad." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{followed}} the fisher's trail {{into the woods}} and found him curled up in a hollow stump. He made slight resistance <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> him out. All his ferocity was already lulled to sleep in the vague, dreamy numbness which Nature always sends to her stricken creatures. He suffered nothing, apparently, though he was fearfully wounded; he just wanted to be let alone. Both eyes were gone, and there was nothing left for me except to finish mercifully what little Quoskh had left undone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course! {{with the}} {{greatest}} pleasure!" [...] she answered, with a smile. [...] "Its finishing, within and without, Father says, is absolutely complete." [...] I stepped over {{and looked at it}} closely. It was made of tulip wood, inlaid in patterns; and was mounted in ormolu. I pulled open one of the drawers, a deep one where I could see the work to great advantage. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> it, something rattled inside as though rolling; there was a tinkle as of metal on metal.|$|E
6000|$|Marble hemmed, {{attempted}} {{to clear his}} throat, pulled down both sleeves of his jacket, settled his black handkerchief to his mind, slily got rid of his quid, and otherwise [...] "cleared ship for action," [...] {{as he would have}} been very apt to describe his own preparations. After all, his heart failed him, at the pinch; and just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was <b>pulling</b> up the horse, he said to me, in a voice so small and delicate, that it sounded odd to one who had heard the man's thunder, as he hailed yards and tops in gales of wind-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... “It’s {{likely you}} know {{the laws of the}} woods better than I do, Billy Kirby,” {{returned}} Natty. “You come in with the settlers, with an ox- goad in your hand, and I come in with moccasins on my feet, and with a good rifle on my shoulders, so long back as afore the old war. Which is likely to know the best? I say no man need tell me that snapping is as good <b>as</b> firing when <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> the trigger.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And we mean {{to treat}} you all," [...] added Lydia, [...] "but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there." [...] Then, showing her purchases--"Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I {{do not think it}} is very pretty; but I thought <b>I</b> might <b>as</b> well buy it <b>as</b> not. <b>I</b> shall <b>pull</b> it to pieces <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> get home, and see if I can make it up any better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you see, I didn't {{know you}} or any {{one else was}} {{within a mile of}} the place. I had a charge left in my rifle, and I wanted to see if I could knock a knot out of that second board in the barn. Just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> the trigger, you came from behind the shed, and then I couldn't call the bullet back. I am sorry that I startled you so, and I was in hopes you would hold out your hat, so that you could have seen how handy I am with a rifle, which would have made you feel easier." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{not without}} an effort I tied the tack, or forward corner of the mainsail, down; then, floundering aft, hauled the afterside of {{it down to the}} boom. That {{accomplished}} and the sail thus reduced by some two feet all along its foot, there remained to be tied the row of short lines, or reef points, which would hold the discarded portion when rolled up; and when part of these were knotted it was with misgivings I leaped up on the after-deck. The long, jerking boom projected a fathom beyond the stern, and I must hold on by my toes while leaning out over the water <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> the reef points at that end together.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] he {{answered}} with his courteous intonation and a faint smile. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> a drawer open his suddenly aroused curiosity {{gave him a}} watchful expression. I wonder what he expected to see. A poem, maybe. All that's beyond guessing now. He was not a cold but a calm man, still more subdued by disease--a man of few words and of an unassuming modesty in general intercourse, but with something uncommon {{in the whole of}} his person which set him apart from the undistinguished lot of our sixty passengers. His eyes had a thoughtful introspective look. In his attractive reserved manner, and in a veiled sympathetic voice he asked: ...|$|E
5000|$|I noticed {{everyone}} in the place was {{doing a lot of}} talking. I could hear them and see several of them sitting around a table. But when I walked in everyone stopped talking. The place was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. It was just as quiet as a death chamber. I knew something must be wrong.... Everyone acted <b>as</b> though <b>I</b> might <b>pull</b> out a machine gun and turn it on them at any minute. As soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> stepped outside, the talking started again...." ...|$|R
500|$|People assume things, because <b>as</b> <b>I</b> said, <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> from my {{personal}} experiences {{to make my}} music... I never experienced [...] firsthand, but it's something I {{wanted to talk about}} ... and it's something that has happened to me in the past... As I said, I have a few deep, dark ones that I've kept stowed away in a closet for a minute... That's why I take this time to speak to you guys and let you know really what it is... I will tell you that I loved [...] a lot and she obviously loved me; it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash. That ain't what broke it up.|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} a [...] towards rappers Eazy-E, Dre's former {{accomplice}} {{from the group}} N.W.A; Tim Dog, an East Coast rapper who slighted the whole West Coast rap scene and released an incendiary diss track towards N.W.A titled [...] "Fuck Compton"; and Luther (Luke) Campbell from 2 Live Crew, whose track [...] "Fakin' Like Gangstas" [...] from his debut solo album I Got Shit On My Mind, featuring JT Money from the group Poison Clan, was taken personally for making references {{to some of the}} popular rappers in the [...] "gangsta" [...] category (specifically referring to N.W.A). There were also some lyrics alluding to former N.W.A rapper Ice Cube, who departed acrimoniously from the group in 1989 and ridiculed Dre on the track [...] "No Vaseline", off his 1991 Death Certificate album. The lyrics: [...] "Then we gon creep to South Central, On a Street Knowledge mission, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> steps in the temple, Spot him, got him, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulls</b> out my strap, Got my chrome to the side of his White Sox hat, You tryin to check my homey, you best check yo self, Cause when you diss Dre you diss yourself" [...] had references to Cube's production operation Street Knowledge Productions (now Lench Mob Records), the lyrics [...] "steps in the temple" [...] referring to Ice Cube's affiliation with the Nation of Islam and his hit single [...] "Check Yo Self" [...] from third album The Predator. However, by the album's release, Ice Cube was on friendlier terms with Dr. Dre, even having a cameo appearance in [...] "Let Me Ride", so unlike Eazy-E and Luke, he was not parodied in the music video.|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw you {{laughing}} {{and talking to}} {{her in front of}} her father's house. I heard you with her in their garden the evening before you left and she disappeared, and it was my voice you heard in the lane. Had I known that you were going that night, I would have followed you and killed you, and saved her. The next morning you were both gone. I waited a time and then went to the depot of your regiment and enlisted. I had failed to save her, but at least I could avenge her. That bullet was mine, and had you not stumbled over a Pandy's body, I suppose, just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> my trigger, you would have been a dead man.|$|E
60|$|The {{very thought}} drove me mad. A terrible desire came upon me {{to rid the}} world of such a monster. There was no lethal weapon at hand, but I seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the cases, and lifting it high, struck, with the edge downward, at the hateful face. But as I did so the head turned, and the eyes fell upon me, with all their blaze of basilisk horror. The sight seemed to paralyze me, and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face, merely making a deep gash above the forehead. The shovel fell from my hand across the box, and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> it away the flange of the blade caught the edge of the lid which fell over again, and hid the horrid thing from my sight. The last glimpse I had was of the bloated face, blood-stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its own in the nethermost hell.|$|E
6000|$|In {{just ten}} minutes another {{swordfish}} was chasing the teasers. It was my thrilling task {{to keep them}} away from him. Hard <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>pulled,</b> I failed to keep {{at least one of}} them from him. He took it with a [...] "wop," [...] his bill half out of the water, and as he turned with a splash R. C. had his bait right there. Smash! The swordfish sheered off, with the bait shining white in his bill. When hooked he broke water about fifty yards out and then gave an exhibition of high and lofty tumbling, water-smashing, and spray-flinging that delighted us. Then he took to long, greyhound leaps and we had to chase him. But he did not last long, with the inexorable R. C. bending back on that Murphy rod. After being cut free, this swordfish lay on the surface a few moments, acting as if he was out of breath. He weighed about one hundred and fifty, and was a particularly beautiful specimen. The hook showed in the corner of his mouth. He did not have a scratch on his graceful bronze and purple and silver body. I waved my hat at him and then he slowly sank.|$|E
5000|$|People assume things, because <b>as</b> <b>I</b> said, <b>I</b> <b>pull</b> from my {{personal}} experiences {{to make my}} music ... I never experienced a child outside of a relationship firsthand, but it's something I {{wanted to talk about}} ... and it's something that has happened to me in the past ... As I said, I have a few deep, dark ones that I've kept stowed away in a closet for a minute ... That's why I take this time to speak to you guys and let you know really what it is ... I will tell you that I loved Chilli a lot and she obviously loved me; it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash. That ain't what broke it up.|$|R
60|$|A diabolical {{inspiration}} came to me. One of the brats, a boy {{about eight}} years old, was watching me <b>as</b> he sang. <b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> out a rupee, held the coin between finger and thumb and looked--only looked--at the gun against the wall. A grin of brilliant and perfect comprehension overspread {{the face of the}} child. Never for an instant stopping the song, {{he held out his hand}} for the money, and then slid the gun to my hand. I might have shot Namgay Doola as he chanted. But I was satisfied. The blood-instinct of the race held true. Namgay Doola drew the curtain across the recess. Angelus was over.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>pulled</b> {{open the}} drawer; <b>as</b> <b>I</b> did so, both Miss Trelawny and I started back in amazement.|$|R
