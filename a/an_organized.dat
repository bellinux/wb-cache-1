5|$|DNA {{is found}} as linear {{chromosomes}} in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. A chromosome is <b>an</b> <b>organized</b> structure consisting of DNA and histones. The set of chromosomes {{in a cell}} and any other hereditary information found in the mitochondria, chloroplasts, or other locations is collectively known as a cell's genome. In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is localized in the cell nucleus, or with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete assemblage of this information in an organism is called its genotype.|$|E

5|$|From about 200,000 in the 1900 Census, Minneapolis {{soared to}} its highest {{population}} recorded in 1950 of over 521,000 people. The main {{growth of the}} city was in part due to <b>an</b> <b>organized</b> private streetcar system. With 140 million passengers by 1920, the streetcars ran down important roads extending from Downtown Minneapolis. Neighborhood residential development out of the core mostly dates {{around the turn of the}} century as a result of this system. This growth also allowed Minneapolis to annex land from neighboring villages and townships which subsequently pushed the incorporation of today's inner ring suburbs.|$|E
