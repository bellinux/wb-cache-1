5|$|Passport to Pimlico is set {{during a}} {{heatwave}} {{that occurred in}} Britain in 1947, but, despite this, filming took place during 1948's abnormally wet summer. The poor weather caused delays in production, {{which led to the}} film being over-time and over-budget. Shooting started early each day, in an attempt to get the first successful shot completed before 9:00 am. An average of ten takes a day were taken, in an attempt to get two <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>minutes</b> of usable film per day. There were arguments between Cornelius and Balcon throughout the production, because Balcon was unhappy with what he saw as poor direction.

5|$|Caracciola {{started from}} the second row of the grid at the German Grand Prix, but was into the lead soon after the start. There he {{remained}} to the finish, in front of von Brauchitsch and Rosemeyer. He took pole position at the Monaco Grand Prix three weeks later, and was soon engaged in a hard fight with von Brauchitsch. The Mercedes-Benz drivers took the lead from each other several times, but von Brauchitsch won after a screw fell into Caracciola's induction system during a pit stop, costing him three <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>minutes.</b> Caracciola won his second race of the season at the Swiss Grand Prix.

5|$|Florida State {{began work}} at its 30-yard line, again needing to just {{run down the}} clock to ensure victory. As before, however, Drew Weatherford took to the air, {{throwing}} a two-yard pass. Two rushing plays followed, but were stopped for little gain. Florida State again went three-and-out and had to punt. Two <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>minutes</b> had been run off the clock, and Virginia Tech took over at its own 30-yard line after a seven-yard kick return. Unlike the two previous drives, however, Virginia Tech had almost no success on offense. A 10-yard holding penalty pushed the Hokie offense back to start the drive, and quarterback Marcus Vick was sacked for a loss to finish off the Tech possession. VT was forced to punt the ball back to Florida State, which took over at its 43-yard line with 6:21 remaining.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half, both teams had more {{offensive}} success. Auburn scored the game's first touchdown four <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>minutes</b> {{into the third}} quarter, widening the Tigers' lead to 16–0. Virginia Tech fought back, driving inside the Auburn 10-yard line before settling for a field goal attempt. Kicker Brandon Pace missed the 23-yard field goal try, leaving the score at 16–0. Tech would have other chances, however. With less than seven minutes remaining in the game, Tech scored its first points of the game after a six-play, 78-yard drive. A 29-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Bryan Randall made the score 16–6 after a missed two-point conversion. As time ran down, Tech closed the gap even further. With just over twominutes remaining in the game, Randall connected on an 80-yard pass to wide receiver Josh Morgan for a touchdown. With the score now at 16–13 and time running out, Tech elected to attempt an onside kick in hopes of having {{a chance for a}} game-winning offensive drive. Auburn recovered the kick, however, and ran out the clock.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} three games, Kansas outscored its opponents 162–16. As Kansas's Big 12 {{schedule}} began, the Jayhawks' winning ways continued, as they proved themselves against legitimate competition. On October 6, Kansas traveled to Manhattan, Kansas, home of then-ranked No.24 Kansas State University for the opening game of its Big12 schedule. In front of 50,924hostile fans, Kansas quarterback Todd Reesing struggled {{for the first time}} in the season. Late in the fourth quarter, Reesing threw a ball that bounced off the facemask of wide receiver Dexton Fields before being intercepted. The interception set up a Kansas State touchdown that put Kansas into a 2421 hole with seven <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>minutes</b> remaining. Reesing and the Jayhawks struck back quickly, however, and scored a 30-yard touchdown to take the lead for good.|$|E
5|$|The Kansas Jayhawks {{began the}} regular season with twelve {{consecutive}} victories before losing to Iowa State by two points after losing {{the lead in the}} closing seconds of the game. Kansas' following game was against Iowa State; this time, the Jayhawks won the game by a margin of nine points. The Jayhawks won their next four games before losing to Oklahoma State in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Due to the lack of a shot-clock in 1957, the Cowboys held the ball for the final three <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>minutes</b> in order to win the game 5654. Both of the Jayhawks regular season losses were in part due to poor ball control by the Jayhawks. The Jayhawks squad closed out {{the regular season}} with four more victories. The Jayhawks closed the regular season with a conference best 111, earning them the Big Seven Conference regular season crown and a bid to the NCAA Tournament.|$|E
5|$|The {{championship}} {{was generally}} contested in professional wrestling matches, {{in which participants}} execute scripted finishes rather than contend in direct competition.

5|$|The inaugural Monaco Grand Prix {{was held}} on 14 April 1929. Caracciola, driving a 7.1-litre Mercedes-Benz SSK, started from the back row of the grid (which was {{allocated}} randomly), and battled Bugatti driver William Grover-Williams for the lead early on. However, his pit stop, which took four <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>minutes</b> to refill his car with petrol, left him unable to recover the time, and he eventually finished third. He won the RAC Tourist Trophy in slippery conditions, and confirmed {{his reputation as a}} specialist in wet track racing. He partnered Werner in the Mille Miglia and Le Mans endurance races in 1930; they finished sixth in the former but were forced to retire after leading for most of the race in the latter after their car's generator burnt out. Caracciola took victory in the 1930 Irish Grand Prix at Phoenix Park, and won four hillclimbs to take the title of European Hillclimb Champion for the first time. However, he was forced to close his dealership in Berlin after the firm went bankrupt.|$|E
