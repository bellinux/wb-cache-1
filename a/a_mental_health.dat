However, during the 1970s and early 1980s, Alaskan politicians systematically stripped {{the trust of}} its lands, transferring the most valuable land to private individuals and state agencies. The asset stripping was eventually ruled to be illegal following several years of litigation, and a reconstituted mental health trust {{was established in the}} mid-1980s.|$|E

During the investigation, Jackson's profile was {{examined}} by Stan Katz, <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> professional, who spent several hours with the accuser as well. According to Taraborrelli, the assessment made by Katz was that Jackson had become a regressed ten-year-old. Some medical professionals have publicly stated their belief that Jackson also had body dysmorphic disorder, a psychological condition whereby the sufferer has no concept of how his or her physical appearance is perceived by others.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{because of}} her {{traumatic}} childhood, Sidle has demonstrated compassion and empathy for victims of domestic violence, and fury against their abusers. She also has {{a soft spot for}} animals, and became a vegetarian after she saw Grissom conduct an experiment on a dead pig. She has also shown a tendency to become very aggressive when under pressure or annoyed, especially in cases involving abused women - such as her arguments with Catherine and Ecklie, and engaging in a heated argument with a man suspected of murdering his wife. In recent years, perhaps {{because of her}} mother's schizophrenia, she has been seen to work several cases with <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> aspect.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia is {{diagnosed}} based on criteria {{in either the}} American Psychiatric Association's (APA) fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5), or the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a clinical assessment by <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> professional. Symptoms associated with schizophrenia occur along a continuum in the population and must reach a certain severity and level of impairment, before a diagnosis is made. As of 2013 there is no objective test.|$|E

5|$|Surjik {{personally}} {{asked if}} he could direct the episode because he was a fan of the series; this was his only credit for the series. Filming the episode was difficult for the cast and crew due largely {{to the fact that the}} script arrived for the cast and crew to film only two days in advance. Other issues arose because of technical reasons; one scene required flooding a hallway with 3,300 gallons of water. Many of the scenes were filmed at Riverview Hospital, <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> facility located in Coquitlam, British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Enrollment levels {{held steady}} into the Great Depression; but in 1933, the Ohio State Senate Welfare Commission {{proposed}} {{a plan to}} convert the school into <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> institution. Students, faculty and administrators organized with the Bowling Green community to counter the proposal. The Student Protest Committee coordinated with the faculty and administration to organize a campus rally and march through the downtown Bowling Green. Members of the Protest Committee then launched a letter-writing campaign to community leaders throughout northwest Ohio, which helped convince the state legislature that closing the school would be counterproductive. The measure was defeated by a 14–5 vote. A few years later, in May 1935, the college was granted university status and {{changed its name to}} Bowling Green State University.|$|E

Wallace continued his social activism {{for the rest of his}} life, publishing the book The Revolt of Democracy just weeks before his death.|$|E

5|$|By 1871 Burnside {{had grown}} significantly; {{it was now}} a mix of villages {{supporting}} a modest population of 1,557. By comparison, Kensington-Norwood, though smaller in area, had grown to 5,132 persons. Glen Osmond, still affected by its immense growth following the expansion of mining, was the largest single population centre with 343 residents. The District Council had also constructed its first council chambers in December 1869, finally concluding the haphazard meeting agreement. Two villages, Beulah Park (North Kensington) and Eastwood experienced booms in population growth and development between 1870 and 1880, providing both housing to new immigrants and investments for the wealthy Adelaide Establishment. Parkside Hospital (now Glenside), <b>a</b> <b>mental</b> <b>health</b> asylum was constructed in 1866 to replace a crowded building in the Parklands. Built on beautifully tended grounds and with an elaborate façade, it was an early Burnside architectural monument. In 1881 Thomas Cooper started brewing South Australia's first branded beer, 'Coopers', at Leabrook. During this era, Stonyfell saw economic expansion as well; its large quarry changed hands in 1867 and the Stonyfell Olive Co was founded in 1873. The late 19th century was a significant time of development in Burnside. This development, however, was brought {{to an abrupt end}} in the last decade, the 1890s, when depression stuck the economies of Australasia after decades of reckless expansion, hitting Burnside hard.|$|E
