40|$|The antioxidative {{capacity}} of seven different porcine tissue hydrolysates (colon, appendix, rectum, pancreas, heart, liver, and lung) were tested by four different assays, including iron chelation, 2, 20 -azino-bis (3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging, 2, 2 -Diphenyl- 1 -(2, 4, 6 -trinitrophenyl) hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, and inhibition of lipid oxidation. All hydrolyzed tissues displayed antioxidant capacity {{in all four}} assays, with colon, liver, and appendix as the three most potent inhibitors of lipid oxidation (47, 29, and 27 mmol/L trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity [TEAC], respectively) and liver, colon, pancreas, and appendix as the four most potent iron chelators (92 % 1. 1, 79. 3 % 3. 2, 77. 1 % 1. 8, and 77 % 2. 3, respectively).

40|$|The {{consumption}} of <b>animal</b> <b>by-products</b> {{has continued to}} witness tremendous growth over the last decade. This is due to its potential to combat protein malnutrition and food insecurity in many countries. Shortly after slaughter, <b>animal</b> <b>by-products</b> are separated into edible or inedible parts. The edible part accounts for 55 % of the production while the remaining part is regarded as inedible by-products (IEBPs). These IEBPs can be re-processed into sustainable products for agricultural and industrial uses. The efficient utilization of <b>animal</b> <b>by-products</b> can alleviate the prevailing cost and scarcity of feed materials, which have high competition between animals and humans. This will also aid in reducing environmental pollution in the society. In this regard, proper utilization of <b>animal</b> <b>by-products</b> such as rumen digesta can result in cheaper feed, reduction in competition and lower cost of production. Over the years, the utilization of <b>animal</b> <b>by-products</b> such as rumen digesta as feed in livestock feed has been successfully carried out without any adverse effect on the animals. However, there are emerging gaps {{that need to be}} further addressed regarding the food security and sustainability of the products. Therefore, the objective of this review highlights the efficacy and effectiveness of using <b>animal</b> <b>by-products</b> as alternative sources of feed ingredients, and the constraints associated with their production to boost livestock performance in the industry at large...|$|R
3000|$|This article {{studies the}} use of <b>animal</b> <b>by-{{products}}</b> and derived products not intended for humans as possible fuels in residential oil burning facilities. We first offer a chemical and physical description of {{the various types of}} <b>animal</b> <b>by-products</b> and derived products not intended for humans with a view to their possible use as fuels. <b>Animal</b> <b>by-products</b> and derived products not intended for humans have an extremely high viscosity for the pressure pulverisation burners used in residential oil burning equipment. We therefore mixed diesel with <b>animal</b> <b>by-products</b> and other derived products not intended for humans in different percentages so as to obtain suitable viscosity. To achieve this, we carried out a study of the miscibility of <b>animal</b> <b>by-products</b> in diesel. We subsequently performed a series of combustion experiments for mixtures of diesel and <b>animal</b> <b>by-products,</b> in varying (a) percentage of by-products in diesel, (b) injection pressure and (c) excess air in combustion. We analysed the experimental combustion results based on (a) energy efficiency of combustion, (b) CO and NO x [...] emissions and (c) fossil-based greenhouse effect gases. Finally, we present the conclusions that combustion of mixed diesel with <b>animal</b> <b>by-products</b> and other derived products not intended for humans for use as boiler fuel low power does not require specific technology when using a conventional fuel oil burner for proper combustion. One only needs to adjust the burner factors: pressure and air flow. In the study of the combustion of mixtures, once the burner factor is adjusted, it appears that the combustion efficiency and greenhouse gas and emission gases are acceptable. The costs of removing fat through incineration or landfill range from 34 to 59 €/ton. The solution proposed in this work not only avoided the cost but also mentioned the value of residue use as fuel.|$|R

40|$|Industrial {{processing}} of livestock, poultry and fish produces {{a large amount}} of waste in a solid or liquid form that can either be destroyed or be used to make compost, biogas or other low-added value products. However, the by-products fromanimal processing industries have a potential for conversion into useful products of higher value, such as protein hydrolysates, with interesting applications in animal feed. Low amounts of animal protein hydrolysates included in aqua-feeds may enhance growth rate and feed conversion of farmed fish and crustacean. Animal protein hydrolysates may also be incorporated in diets to enhance the nonspecific immunity of fish. Aswell, these hydrolysates {{can be used as a}} good source of amino acids for newlyweaned animals. Protein hydrolysates from <b>animal</b> <b>by-products</b> including antimicrobials, antioxidants, opioid-like and/or other interesting bioactive molecules have promising and interesting applications on companion and production <b>animals.</b> <b>By-products</b> from <b>animal</b> processing industries are therefore a promising source of bioactive peptides of considerable interest for animal care, always within the framework of the existing legislation.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{digestibility}} of <b>animal</b> <b>by-product</b> protein {{was measured}} using a direct color-imetric assay of protein in feed and excreta samples. Excreta samples were generated by using a modification of the true metabolizable energy procedure (Sibbald, 1979). Dried excreta and feed samples were extracted with, 5 N NaOH for 2 hr at 45 C in an orbital incubator, and the solubilized protein was quantitated directly using Coomassie brilliant blue dye-binding. Digestibility of meat and bone meal protein by this method ranged between 70. 3 and 96. 0 %. The digestibility of feather meals ranged between 79. 0 and 86. 1 %. Coomassie brilliant blue reacts specifically with intact protein molecules and is insensitive to uric acid nitrogen. This procedure {{may prove to be}} especial-ly useful in the evaluation of protein digestibility in the chicken.
