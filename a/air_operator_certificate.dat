25|$|On 30 November 2015, Transport Canada {{suspended}} Buffalo Airway's <b>Air</b> <b>Operator</b> <b>Certificate,</b> {{citing the}} airline's poor safety record.

Service was maintained using chartered aircraft. On 12 January 2016, the licence was reinstated.|$|E

25|$|With {{the reunification}} of the two Germanies which took place that year, German {{airlines}} took over the scheduled and charter operations which had previously been undertaken, {{under the terms of}} the post-World War II Potsdam Agreement, by the British, American and French airline operators. Capt Twomey reluctantly decided to sell Berlin European's airport slots and other effects to Germania, with effect from 1 April 1991. On that day Berlin European's <b>Air</b> <b>Operator</b> <b>Certificate</b> expired and the transfer of its ownership to Germania became effective.|$|E
25|$|Following the UK’s {{referendum}} vote {{to leave}} the European Union easyJet plans to establish an <b>Air</b> <b>Operator</b> <b>Certificate</b> (AOC) in another EU member state. This will secure the flying rights of the 30% of easyJet's network that remains wholly within and between EU states, excluding the UK. easyJet expects a one-off cost of around £10 million over two years with up to £5 million incurred in the 2017 financial year. The primary driver of the cost is the re-registering of aircraft in an EU AOC jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|In February 2008, {{the carrier}} {{acquired}} two de Havilland Canada Dash DHC 8-Q311s. In December 2008, the Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority (TCAA) withdrew Air Tanzania's <b>Air</b> <b>Operator</b> <b>Certificate</b> because the airline {{had failed to}} meet the standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization. Two weeks later, the International Air Transport Association banned the air carrier from all aviation transactions and informed all travel agencies and other aviation companies to stop all transactions with Air Tanzania until further notice. The certificate was restored in January 2009, with both the TCAA and Air Tanzania claiming there had never been any doubt about the airworthiness of its aircraft. In 2009, Air Tanzania flew 60,018 passengers, while Precision Air moved 583,000 passengers and Coastal Aviation 141,995 passengers.|$|E

25|$|Manx2's Belfast-Cork route was {{operated}} on the <b>Air</b> <b>Operator</b> <b>Certificate</b> (AOC) of Flightline S.L., based in Barcelona. As such Flightline {{was responsible for}} controlling all operational matters relating to that service. In practice many day-to-day decisions were taken by Manx2 in its Isle of Man office. One such decision was the pairing of Lopez and Cantle to crew flight 7100 on 10 February. Correct adherence to European aviation regulations (EU-OPS) by the AOC-holder should have prevented this inappropriate pairing of a newly promoted captain with a relatively inexperienced first officer. It had come about because Cantle was drafted in to replace the pilot who was originally rostered as first officer for the flight when he became unavailable. Flightline {{was not aware of}} the change in personnel.|$|E

It carried over 186,000 passengers from 1986 to 2015.
