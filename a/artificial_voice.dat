And at the bed's head was a coloured picture beautiful to see, representing as it were another Johnny seated on the knee of some Angel surely who loved little children. And, marvellous fact, to lie and stare at: Johnny had become one of a little family, all in little quiet beds (except two playing dominoes in little arm-chairs at a little table on the hearth): and on all the little beds were little platforms whereon were to be seen dolls' houses, woolly dogs with mechanical barks in them not very dissimilar from the <b>artificial</b> <b>voice</b> pervading the bowels of the yellow bird, tin armies, Moorish tumblers, wooden tea things, and the riches of the earth.|$|E
6000|$|The {{writer in}} the Times to whom the victorious orator here refers {{describes}} how, 'like two of Sir Walter Scott's champions, these redoubtable antagonists gathered up all their force for the final struggle, and encountered each other in mid-career; how, rather equal than like, each side viewed the struggle of their chosen athletes, as if to prognosticate from the war of words the fortunes of two parties so nicely balanced and marshalled in apparently equal array. Mr. Disraeli's speech,' he says, 'was in every respect worthy of his oratorical reputation. The retorts were pointed and bitter, the hits telling, the sarcasm keen, the argument in many places cogent, in all ingenious, and in some convincing. The merits were counterbalanced by no less glaring defects of tone, temper, and feeling. In some passages invective was pushed to the limit of virulence, and in others, meant no doubt to relieve them by contrast, the coarser stimulants to laughter were very freely applied. Occasionally whole sentences were delivered with an <b>artificial</b> <b>voice</b> and a tone of studied and sardonic bitterness, peculiarly painful to the audience, and tending greatly to diminish {{the effect of this}} great intellectual and physical effort. The speech of Mr. Gladstone was in marked contrast. It was characterised throughout by the most earnest sincerity. It was pitched in a high tone of moral feeling--now rising to indignation, now sinking to remonstrance--which was sustained throughout without flagging and without effort. The language was less ambitious, less studied, but more natural and flowing than that of Mr. Disraeli; and though commencing in a tone of stern rebuke, it ended in words of almost pathetic expostulation.... That power of persuasion which seems entirely denied to his antagonist, Mr. Gladstone possesses to great perfection, and to judge by the countenances of his hearers, those powers were very successfully exerted. He had, besides, the immense advantage resulting from the tone of moral superiority which he assumed and successfully maintained, and which conciliated to him the goodwill of his audience in a degree never attained by the most brilliant sallies of his adversary, and when he concluded the House might well feel proud of him and of themselves.' ...|$|E

40|$|From <b>artificial</b> <b>voices</b> in GPS to {{automatic}} {{systems of}} dictation, from voice-based identity verification to voice pathology detection, speech processing applications are nowadays omnipresent {{in our daily}} life. By offering solutions to companies seeking for efficiency enhancement with simultaneous cost saving, the market of speech technology is forecast to be particularly promising in the next years. The present thesis deals with advances in glottal analysis in order to incorporate new techniques within speech processing applications. While current systems are usually based on information related to the vocal tract configuration, the airflow passing through the vocal folds, and called glottal flow, is expected to exhibit a relevant complementarity. Unfortunately, glottal analysis from speech recordings requires specific complex processing operations, which explains why it has been generally avoided. The main goal of this thesis is to provide new advances in glottal analysis so as to popularize it in speech processing. First, new techniques for glottal excitation estimation and modeling are proposed and shown to outperform other state-of-the-art approaches on large corpora of real speech. Moreover, proposed methods are integrated within various speech processing applications: speec...|$|R

40|$|The {{first part}} of this work focuses on ways to replace missing source voice in case of {{patients}} after total laryngectomy. The commonly used methods of voice rehabilitation are mentioned. Simple computational models are used to explore several principles of generating <b>artificial</b> source <b>voice.</b> Based on the knowledge of how a healthy human voice is generated, one of the ways to generate <b>artificial</b> source <b>voice</b> was chosen – a reed-based element in the configuration (-, +). The function of the reed-based element is based on a periodic bending of the reed and in the airflow cutoff created by this motion. The (-,+) configuration of the reed-based element causes a different behaviour, when compared to healthy vocal folds, important is, however, whether the generated acoustic signal has the right spectral characteristics, which enable the generation of voiced vowels of the human speech. Both experimental and computational models are used to study the behaviour of the reed-based element. The design of the experimental model is based on the preliminary experiments with simple reed-based elements, which were carried out at the beginning of my studies. The new experimental model is designed in such a way, that it enables changes to the reed geometry and its position towards the reed stop. The measurements carried out on the experimental model are mainly acoustical (measurements of the generated acoustical signal), but optical measurements of the reed´s movement and position are possible and used as well. Because {{of the nature of the}} reed-based element´s behavior, the fluid structure interaction must be taken into consideration in the computational model. A two-way model of fluid structure interaction is used between the fluid part of the computational model and the structural one. A partitioned solution is used to solve the fluid-structure interaction. The effect of specific input parameters on the function of both models (experimental and computational) is monitored. The influences of input parameters on the basic frequency of the generated signal (source voice), on the stability of the function and on other important characteristics are evaluated. The final chapters focus on the design of voice prosthesis in general. Some specific issues, which need to be solved when designing voice prosthesis, are highlighted...|$|R
