50|$|The {{aldehyde}} tag {{is a short}} peptide tag {{which can}} be introduced into fusion proteins and by subsequent treatment with the formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE) a reactive aldehyde group is generated for further coupling. Since there already is an array of aldehyde-speciﬁc reagents commercially available (such as <b>aminooxy</b> or hydrazide reagents), possible applications are diverse and include the conjugation of fluorophores, glycans, PEG (polyethylene glycol) chains or reactive groups for further synthesis (see applications).|$|E
50|$|Next, the {{introduction}} of N-acetylglucoseamine (GlcNAc) to the aldehyde tagged proteins via oxime formation was carried out through the treatment with <b>aminooxy</b> GlcNAc (AO-GlcNAc) (Fig. 3B). The conjugation was confirmed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) and lectin blot with the GlcNAc-binding wheat germ agglutinin attached to AlexaFluor 647. Having successfully introduced GlcNAc, the monomer was extended with a glycan structure containing GlcNAc, mannose (Man) and galactose (Gal) (Fig. 3C). A mutant endoglycosidase EndoS (EndoS-D233Q) was utilised as it is highly speciﬁc for IgG Fc N-linked GlcNAc residues and does not elongate Asn-GlcNAc sites on other proteins or on denatured IgGs. Product formation was again monitored by LC-ESI-MS and lectin blot probing with the sialic acid-binding sambucus nigra agglutinin attached to ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate.|$|E
50|$|Smith et al. {{demonstrate}} {{the application of}} the aldehyde tag as a chemical conjugation site for glycans. The aldehyde tag sequence was incooperated into the Fc construct and introduced into CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells. As controls, gene constructs were used in which the cysteine residue was mutated to an alanine. After expression, the Fc proteins were purified using a protein A/G agarose column. The conversion in CHO cells of cystein to formylglycine was examined using <b>aminooxy</b> AlexaFluor 488 and subsequent SDS-PAGE. However, fluorescence scanning displayed no fluorescence labelling, i.e. no formylglycine formation by endogenous FGE in CHO cells. The unaltered proteins were then treated with recombinant FGE from Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vitro in which the aldehyde group was successfully installed at the glycosylation site of Fc (Fig. 3A).|$|E
50|$|Hudak at al. {{explored}} {{the strategy of}} producing protein-protein conjugates {{with the help of}} the aldehyde tag. Their aim was to connect full length human IgG (hIgG) to the human growth hormone (hGH). These protein-protein conjugates can be superior to monomeric proteins in terms of serum half life in protein therapeutics and, additionally, have appealing dual binding properties.In order to achieve protein fusion, the five-residue aldehyde tag (CxPxR) was incooperated into hIgG and hGH. In hIgG, the aldehyde tag was introduced at the C termini of the two heavy chains, resulting in two possible conjugation sites. FGE then oxidizes the cysteine residue to formylglycine (fGly) during protein expression. For the subsequent conjugation steps, the strategy of the copper-free click chemistry was selected. A strain-promoted 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of a cyclooctynes and an azide was carried out forming a covalent linkage (also termed the Cu-free azide-alkyne cycloaddition). Thus, the aldehyde bearing proteins react under oxime formation with different heterobifunctional linkers which carry an <b>aminooxy</b> residue on one end and either an azide or cyclooctynes on the other. This results in the attachment of hIgG to a linker containing a cyclooctyne (here dibenzoazacyclooctyne (DIBAC)) and hGH to a linker holding an azide function (Fig.: 2A and B). The proteins hGH and hIgG were also treated with DIBAC-488, azide Alexa Fluor 647 and analysed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot to validate oxime formation. Next, the DIBAC-hIgG and azide-hGH derivatives are joined by Cu-free click chemistry (Fig.: 2C). The resulting fusion proteins were purified and analyzed by immunoblot (see Hudak et al. 2012).|$|E
5000|$|The {{aldehyde}} tag is {{an artificial}} peptide tag {{recognized by the}} formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE). Formylglycine is a glycine with a formyl group (-CHO, an aldehyde) at the α-carbon. The sulfatase motif {{is the basis for}} the sequence of the peptide which results in the site-specific conversion of a cysteine to a formylglycine residue. The peptide tag was engineered after studies on FGE recognizable sequences in sulfatases from different organisms. Carrico et al. discovered a high homology in the sulfatase motif in bacteria, archaea as well as eukaryotes. Aldehydes and ketones find use as chemical reporters due to their strong electrophilic properties. This enables a reaction under mild conditions when using a strong nucleophilic coupling partner. Typically, hydrazides and <b>aminooxy</b> probes are used in bioconjugation. They form stabilized addition products with carbonyl groups that are favoured under the physiological reaction conditions. At neutral pH, the equilibrium of Schiff base formation, is lying far to the reactant’s side. To make more product named compounds are used to form stable hydrazones and oximes. Since the pH-optimum of 4 to 6 cannot be achieved by adding a catalyst due to associated toxicity, the reaction is slow in live cells. A typical reaction constant is 10−4 to 10−3 M−1 s−1. A carbonyl group is introduced into proteins as a chemical reporter using different techniques, including modern methods like stop codon suppression and the herein discussed aldehyde tag. Limiting the use of aldehydes and ketones is their restricted bioorthogonality in certain cellular environments.Limitations of aldehydes and ketones as chemical reporters are due to ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} a series of <b>aminooxy</b> analogues of the {{biogenic}} polyamines spermidine and spermine on the conformation of calf thymus DNA is studied. These new molecules are isosteric and charge insufficient analogues that are suitable to study the roles of both charge distribution and structural requirements in the molecular physiology of the biogenic polyamines. They are also evidenced as useful tools to inhibit polyamine biosynthesis and cell growth. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of solutions containing DNA and the <b>aminooxy</b> analogues at different concentrations (100 - 1000 muM) and different pH values, (5 - 7. 5) are recorded. We use both sonicated and highly polymerized calf thymus DNA. The CD spectra of sonicated DNA showed the formation of psi-DNA, a highly ordered aggregated structure similar to liquid crystals, {{in the presence of the}} <b>aminooxy</b> analogues. Aggregation induced by an <b>aminooxy</b> derivative of spermine is followed by DNA collapse when increasing the polyamine concentration. The features of psi-DNA are not detected for highly polymerized DNA. Temperature melting measurements support a high degree of structural order of the aggregates. The CD experiments indicate that dications are unable to induce major changes on the macromolecular structure of DNA. In addition, aggregation is only observed when the trimethylene moiety is present between two adjacent positive charges. The observed differences among the CD spectra of DNA solutions with different <b>aminooxy</b> derivatives of spermidine indicate different roles for different amino groups of this biogenic polyamine when interacting with DNA. Our results support the idea that <b>aminooxy</b> analogues can be used as good models in studying the physiological functions of biogenic polyamines. (C) 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes research {{focused on}} the synthesis, polymerization and applications of cationic <b>aminooxy</b> lipids. An efficient and convenient method was developed to stabilize liposomes using 2 ̆ 7 click chemistry 2 ̆ 7. The 2 ̆ 7 click stabilized liposomes 2 ̆ 7 are fortified via covalent crosslinks generated between aldehyde and <b>aminooxy</b> functionalities in the lipid bilayers. Compared to untreated liposomes (i. e., no lipid-lipid bonding), the 2 ̆ 7 click 2 ̆ 7 stabilized liposomes are considerably more stable against surfactant-mediated liposome disruption or serum-mediated liposome aggregation. Stabilized liposomes also can react with 2 ̆ 7 clickable 2 ̆ 7 targeted ligands on the liposome surface for specific organ (e. g. breast cancer cells or liver) targeting. In this thesis, I have explored the feasibility of using the click stabilized liposomes in three different applications: i) colonic targeted delivery ii) gene vector iii) enzyme nanoreactor. This dissertation is divided into six chapters. Chapter 1 gives a review of liposomes and liposome stabilization. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis and characterization of cationic <b>aminooxy</b> compounds 2. 1 and 2. 2 as the headgroup domains of prototype lipids. Chapter 3 describes the synthesis, characterization and hydrolysis of cationic <b>aminooxy</b> enol ether lipids 3. 1 and 3. 2. The liposomes formulated from lipid 3. 2 were stabilized using a pH-triggered lipid polymerization strategy. Chapter 4 describes the synthesis and characterization {{of a variety of}} <b>aminooxy</b> lipids and dextran polyaldehydes (DPAs). The liposomes formulated from lipids 4. 1 were stabilized by simply mixing with DPAs. The resultant 2 ̆ 7 click 2 ̆ 7 stabilized liposomes have potential applications such as drug carriers for colonic targeted delivery and as nano-reactors. Chapter 5 focuses on applying 2 ̆ 7 click 2 ̆ 7 stabilized liposomes as gene carriers. The initial results of in vitro gene transfection revealed that the stabilized lipoplexes formulated from lipid 4. 1 successfully transfected MFC- 7 cells, but with lower transfection potency.

40|$|By FT±Raman spectroscopy, we have {{investigated}} the effect of 1 -aminooxy-spermine (AOSPM) on aggregation and stability of calf-thymus DNA and selected oligonucleotide chains. AOSPM is able to mimic spermine in some macromolecular inter-actions, but is unable to substitute polyamines to maintain cell proliferation, suggesting pharmaco-logical applications. Raman spectra of solutions containing AOSPM and either genomic DNA or two 15 mer oligodeoxyribonucleotides, with GC or AT sequences, were recorded. Precipitation was observed for calf-thymus DNA, aggregated struc-tures and appearance of several Z marker bands were observed for the 15 mer GC sequence, and no macromolecular changes were detected for the 15 mer AT sequence. Speci®c binding sites between the <b>aminooxy</b> group and the base residues were also evidenced. Assignment of the AOSPM Raman bands was supported on a normal mode calculation for the molecule NH 2 -O-CH 3, as a model.

Preferential binding by the major groove was evidenced in the absence of macromolecular changes. When either precipitation or aggregation occurred, the interaction involved both the major and minor grooves.

40|$|ADP-ribosylation is an {{important}} post-translational modification involved in processes including cellular replication, DNA repair, and cell death. Despite these roles, the functions of ADP-ribosylation, in particular mono-ADP-ribosylation, remain poorly understood.

The potential utility of this "ready-to-use" cross-linking reagent for creating complex and fragile tri-component (bio) molecular systems was illustrated through (1) the rapid preparation of a three-colour FRET cascade with valuable spectral properties and (2) the luminescent/fluorescent labelling of peptides and peptide-oligonucleotide conjugates. Thus, such (bio) molecular assemblies were readily obtained via a three-step process or in a "one-pot" manner, both involving oxime ligation, thiol-alkylation (S(N) 2 or Michael addition) and copper-catalysed azide-alkyne 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition (CuAAC) reactions...|$|E

G., Radhakrishnan, A. N., Savithri, H. S., & Appaji Rao, N. (1989) Biochemistry (preceding paper in this issue) ]. The reaction of AAA (0. 5 mM) with the Schiff base of the enzyme resulted {{in the formation of}} pyridoxal 5 '-phosphate(PLP) and was biphasic with rate constants of 191 and 19 s-l. The formation of the PLP-AAA oxime measured by decrease in absorbance at 388 nm on interaction of AAA with the enzyme had a rate constant of 5. 2 M-' s-l. On the other hand, the reaction of L-canaline with the enzyme was slower as measured by the disruption of enzyme-Schiff base than the reaction of OADS and AAA. In contrast, the formation of PLP as an intermediate could not be detected upon the interaction of hydroxylamine with the enzyme. The reaction of D-cycloserine with the enzyme was much slower(1. 6 X lo 2 M-' s-l) than the <b>aminooxy</b> compounds.

40|$|The {{reaction}} of an <b>aminooxy</b> moiety (RONH 2) with an aldehyde or ketone carbonyl, an oximation reaction, {{results in the}} formation of robust oxime ether linkages. Oximation is a form of click chemistry and is chemoselective, occurs in a variety of solvents including water, and produces high yields with little to no purification. We were inspired to exploit the advantages of oximation reactions by attaching aminooxy-functionalized molecules to solid supports, thus allowing us to employ <b>aminooxy</b> chemistry in ways that cannot be achieved using solution phase. Chapter 1 provides a review of <b>aminooxy</b> chemistry, its advantages over similar reactions and its multitude of applications. Chapter 2 describes the use of aminium <b>aminooxy</b> salts fixed to a silicon microreactor to enable the capture of volatile aldehydes and ketones from exhaled breath for early detection of lung cancer. Since only carbonyl compounds were retained and thereby concentrated, the accurate measurements of scarce metabolite cancer markers were realized. Use of an acid-scavenging polymer transformed the aminium salt adducts into a volatile adducts, thus enabling analyses by both high resolution mass spectrometry and gas chromatography. Chapter 3 details our investigation into the use of thermally-induced intramolecular cyclization as a release mechanism. A kinetic study on the cyclization rates of a panel of thermally-labile linkers led to a demonstration involving such an aminooxyfunctionalized linker covalently bonded within a poly(dimethylsiloxane) microchannel. After capture of an aldehyde-functionalized fluorophore that had been passed through the microchannel, the intramolecular cyclization release mechanism was induced by gentle warming to liberate the fluorescent oxime ether adduct. In Chapter 4 we applied our t hermally-labile linkers to iron oxide nanoparticles in an effort to design an externally controlled drug delivery system. Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles generate heat when subjected to an alternating magnetic field (AMF), thus eliminating the need for an in vivo conventional heat source. During our investigation of AMF-induced release we discovered the unprecedented hydrolysis of robust chemical functionalities that occurs only at the nanoparticle-liquid interface. This discovery was exploited {{in the development of a}} delivery system capable of releasing oxime ether adducts. In conclusion, this thesis describes novel innovations that can be immediately applied in a multitude of disciplines, from analytics to diagnoses and to drug delivery...|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} {{between an}} <b>aminooxy</b> moiety (RONH 2) and a carbonyl group of either an aldehyde or a ketone — {{known as an}} oximation reaction — is a versatile click chemistry coupling that generates a robust oxime ether linkage. The oximation reaction is chemoselective and can be performed under mild conditions in a large variety of solvents, including water. The attractive properties of the <b>aminooxy</b> group and derived oximation reactions, reviewed in Chapter 1, inspired us to use this chemistry as a key feature of our research. Specifically, we prepare functionalized <b>aminooxy</b> compounds so that the oximation chemistry can then serve {{as a prelude to}} new synthetic or analytical methods. For example, Chapter 2 presents an improved preparation of O- (diphenylphosphinyl) hydroxylamine (DPPH), an aminooxy-containing reagent, using the classic Schotten-Baumann conditions. We show how DPPH can then be used as a chemoselective nitrogen transfer reagent for a one-pot aldehyde-to-nitrile functional group transformation. Sixteen aldehydes were smoothly transformed to their in another application, we use functionalized <b>aminooxy</b> reagents to achieve quantitative multiplexed gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Specifically, we chemoselectively derivatize carbonyl (aldehyde and ketone) metabolites using the aminooxy-containing reagents. Chapter 3 presents a focused fundamental study of the propensity of oxime ethers to undergo MS-induced fragmentations, such as the McLafferty rearrangement. In particular, we studied structural factors that promoted a,ß-fragmentation in oximes of both ketones and aldehydes, as well as the derived silyl ethers of these adducts. We determined that 1) the propensity of the McLafferty rearrangement was greatly enhanced by oxygen at the b-position of silyl oxime ethers, 2) the McLafferty rearrangement is more prominent for E-isomers of oxime and silyl oxime ethers than for the corresponding Z-isomers, and 3) Z-isomers of silyl oxime ethers with CH 2 at the b-position generate nitrilium ions {{to a greater extent than}} their corresponding E-isomers. Chapter 4 describes the 3 -step synthesis of a new class of stable isotope-labeled derivatizing reagents –– aminooxyethyl propionate reagents (AEP) –– that enable multiplexed GC-MS analysis of small molecule carbonyl compounds. The AEP reagents contain 1) an <b>aminooxy</b> moiety, and 2) a propionate ester moiety that generates a reporter isotope-labeled mass spectral tag (MST) in the form of an ethyl carbenium ion via an ester a-cleavage. The AEP MSTs appear in an m/z zone of minimal interference (ZMI) in the range m/z 32 - 34. This is a key feature in that unobstructed observation of reporter MSTs in this zone significantly improves simultaneous quantitation of carbonyl analytes from multiple samples without recourse to MS peak deconvolution strategies. Also, and in contrast to known isotope coding reagents for GC-MS, AEP reagents are not affected by the chromatographic isotope effect. The versatility of the technology for carbonyl metabolite profiling and absolute quantification is demonstrated by an analysis of turmeric extract, serving as a representative complex biological sample. A series of analogous methyl ketones were profiled from characteristic MS fragmentations of the AEP-derived oxime ether adducts, and two members, 2 -nonanone and 2 -undecanone, were quantified using AEP-labeled external standards. Finally, Chapter 5 concludes with additional demonstrations of click chemistry. We used oximation to ligate linker molecules to fluorophores and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to generate a fluorescent nano-entity for breast cancer location and diagnosis. Five homologous linkers, each consisting of a thiol-terminated hydrophobic domain coupled to an aminooxy-terminated PEG-based domain, were prepared using a 6 -step synthesis in 7 - 25 % overall yield. The <b>aminooxy</b> end subsequently was reacted with an aldehyde-functionalized cypate fluorophore, and the thiol end was used for attachment to gold nanoparticles. Linker attachment to cypate in this manner was superior to previously investigated amide coupling involving linker amines and cypate carboxylic acid. Collectively, the results from these investigations demonstrates a novel strategy that employs functionalized <b>aminooxy</b> substrates and reagents to first exploit the high yielding and selective click coupling with carbonyl substrates to set the stage for secondary synthetic or analytical operations. Approaches developed in this multifaceted study appear to be applicable to a variety of synthetic problems ranging from those of a purely chemical nature to other impacting biological systems...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis the {{development}} of new, efficient and bioorthogonal conjugation methods for the derivatization of cube-octameric silsesquioxanes (COSS) is described. The successful synthesis of an octaazide COSS scaffold allowed for the eightfold conjugation of an octa-RGD peptide via copper(I) -catalyzed alkyne-azide [3 + 2] cycloaddition (CuAAC) in a water-free system. As COSS cages are stable in acidic media and aldehydes are easily addressable in this environment, aminooxy-functionalized silsesquioxane derivatives promise high reaction rates upon oxime ligation. Thus, pendant <b>aminooxy</b> groups were introduced into an octaamino COSS precursor by amide coupling with protected <b>aminooxy</b> acetic acid. The subsequent oximation allowed the efficient conjugation {{with a number of}} peptidic molecules having up to 35 amino acids in their backbones, among them functional peptides as [KVSALKE] 5 or disulfide-rich miniproteins. The number of attached ligands was not only dependent on the reaction rate, but was also dictated by the steric and electrostatic repulsion of the ligands. Thus, this work showed different experimental approaches to the synthesis of biofunctionalized COSS. Furthermore, a peptide-COSS conjugate was used to demonstrate the possibility to address a central cellular process (DNA replication in higher cells), showing the great application potential of these nanoparticles. Additionally, a preparatory approach is described that might allow for the synthesis of alcohol- and aldehyde-derivatized COSS particles via biotransformation of halogenated silsesquioxanes using haloalkane dehalogenases. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of interaction of methoxyamine with sheep liver serine hydroxymethyltransferase (EC 2. 1. 2. 1) (SHMT) {{was established by}} measuring changes in enzyme activity, visible absorption spectra, circular dichroism and fluorescence, and by evaluating the rate constant by stopped-flow spectrophotometry. Methoxyamine {{can be considered as}} the smallest substituted <b>aminooxy</b> derivative of hydroxylamine. It was a reversible noncompetitive inhibitor (Ki = 25 microM) of SHMT similar to O-amino-D-serine. Like in the interaction of O-amino-D-serine and aminooxyacetic acid, {{the first step in the}} reaction was very fast. This was evident by the rapid disappearance of the enzyme-Schiff base absorbance at 425 nm with a rate constant of 1. 3 x 10 (3) M- 1 sec- 1 and CD intensity at 430 nm. Concomitantly, there was an increase in absorbance at 388 nm (intermediate I). The next step in the reaction was the unimolecular conversion (1. 1 x 10 (- 3) sec- 1) of this intermediate to the final oxime absorbing at 325 nm. The identity of the oxime was established by its characteristic fluorescence emission at 460 nm when excited at 360 nm and by high performance liquid chromatography. These results highlight the specificity in interactions of <b>aminooxy</b> compounds with sheep liver serine hydroxymethyltransferase and that the carboxyl group of the inhibitors enhances the rate of the initial interaction with the enzyme...|$|E

(<b>Aminooxy)</b> acetic acid at 12 [mu]mole/flower extended vase life to 15. 1 days, STS at 1 [mu]mole/flower extended vase life to 15. 3 days, and MA at 1 [mu]mole/flower shortened vase life to 8. 8 days compared with 10. 3 days for the water control. (<b>Aminooxy)</b> acetic acid and STS inhibited the activity of 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase, and {{this resulted in a}} low ACC content and a low activity of the constitutive ethylene-forming-enzyme (EFE). The ultimate result of these metabolic events was that C[subscript] 2 H[subscript] 4 biosynthesis was inhibited. Moreover, both AOA and STS decreased the respiratory rate as measured by CO[subscript] 2 production. Malonate increased ACC synthase activity, and this increased the ACC content. Also, malonate increased respiration, which was unexpected. However, MA in combination with either AOA or STS reduced both C[subscript] 2 H[subscript] 4 biosynthesis and respiration;Little ACC synthase activity existed in the upper portion of the petals, while the basal portion of the petals contained a higher ACC synthase activity. At the beginning of the vase-life cycle, ACC synthase activity was low. This was followed by a burst of activity at the climacteric, and this was followed by a decline before the death of the flowers. Ethylene-forming-enzyme activity was assayed by determining the maximum rate of C[subscript] 2 H[subscript] 4 production. Flowers pulsed with AOA or STS showed low EFE activity related to C[subscript] 2 H[subscript] 4 production, while the MA pulse treatment showed an increase of EFE activity at the climacteric;These results indicate that the inhibition of C[subscript] 2 H[subscript] 4 biosynthesis and mode of action was caused by AOA and STS.

Structural {{knowledge of these}} proteins is of highest interest for structure-based drug design, {{which is one of}} the approaches that can be used in order to fight tuberculosis (TB). The structure of the conserved hypothetical protein Rv 0216 was refined to a resolution of 1. 9 Å. The structure exhibits a so-called double hotdog-fold, similar to known hydratases. However, only parts of the hydratase active site are conserved in Rv 0216, and no function could be assigned to the protein. Several Rv 0216 -like protein sequences were found in a variety of actino- and proteobacteria, suggesting that these proteins form a new protein family. Furthermore, other hotdog-folded proteins in M. tuberculosis were identified, of which a few are likely to be hydratases or dehydratases involved in the fatty acid metabolism. The structure of Rv 0130 exhibits a single hotdog-fold and contains a highly conserved R-hydratase motif. Rv 0130 was shown to hydrate fatty acid coenzyme A derivatives with a length of six to eight carbons. The Rv 0130 active site is situated in a long tunnel, formed by a kink in the central hotdog-helix, which indicate that it can utilize long fatty acid chains as well. A number of previously predicted hotdog-folded proteins also feature a similar tunnel. The structure of branched chain aminotransferase (BCAT) of M. smegmatis was determined in the apo-form and in complex with an <b>aminooxy</b> inhibitor. Mycobacterial BCAT is very similar to the human BCAT, apart for one important difference in the active site. Gly 243 is a threonine in the human BCAT, a difference that offers specificity in inhibition and substrate recognition of these proteins. The <b>aminooxy</b> compound and MES were found to inhibit the mycobacterial BCAT activities. The <b>aminooxy</b> compound inhibits by blocking the substrate-pocket. A second inhibitor-binding site was identified through the binding of a MES molecule. Therefore, both the MES-binding site and the substrate-pocket of M. smegmatis BCAT are suggested to be potential sites for the development of new inhibitors against tuberculosis...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of nanomaterials as medical diagnostic and therapeutic agents is a rapidly expanding field. A brief {{search of the}} literature revealed that roughly half of all articles related to nanoparticle-based drug delivery were published after the onset of this thesis research, over the past 4 years. A few nano-based formulations have entered into clinical use, including liposomal drug formulations, protein-linked drugs, and nanoparticle-based MRI contrast agents. The chemistry that enables conjugation of a functional cargo, whether a drug, a targeting element, or a radionucleotide, to a nanocarrier is thus a critical component for development. Oximation {{is one of the}} simplest and most efficient chemical conjugation methods. It entails condensation of an <b>aminooxy</b> group with an aldehyde or ketone carbonyl yielding an oxime ether. The versatility of oximation is highlighted and exploited in this thesis. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the application of iron oxide nanoparticles in medicine, and more specifically, to nanoparticles as delivery agents for the anticancer drug doxorubicin. Chapter 2 describes an oximation methodology for cellular metabolite derivatization to enhance the detection of carbonyl analytes using mass spectrometry (MS). Integration of carbonyl-selective <b>aminooxy</b> functionality with a quaternary ammonium moiety for MS electrospray enhancement and a hydrophobic domain for sample cleanup led us to design reagent QDA (quaternary dodecyl <b>aminooxy)</b> and its 13 CD 3 isotopologue *QDA. Analysis of QDA/*QDA-treated lung adenocarcinoma A 549 cells established a profile of carbonyl metabolites spanning multiple structural classes showing capability for global carbonyl profiling. In Chapter 4, hydroxylated cationic oxime ether lipids are described for coating core-shell Fe 3 O 4 -SiO 2 nanoparticles. Formulation of the nanoparticles produced lipid-coated, highly ζ–potential–positive assemblies: a new form of cationic magnetoliposomes (CML). The CMLs were evaluated as potential drug carriers by integrating into the bilayer a hydrophobically modified analog of doxorubicin. On treatment of MCF- 7 breast cancer cells with the drug-loaded CMLs, the assemblies were rapidly internalized and exhibited higher toxicity than treatments with doxorubicin alone. In a separate assessment of the oxime ether lipids, complexation with nucleic acids to form cationic lipoplexes similarly showed high cellular uptake and marked them as viable candidates for siRNA delivery. Chapter 5 provides all experimental procedures for the aforementioned science...|$|E
40|$|The {{preparation}} {{of a novel}} radioiodination reagent, the (<b>aminooxy)</b> acetyl derivative of (p-[125]-iodophenyl) ethylamine, is described. Conventional radioiodination of proteins involves the formation of iodotyrosine residues, but for in vivo applications such as thyroid or stomach immunoscintigraphy, the susceptibility of these residues to tissue dehalogenases constitutes a serious disadvantage. Using our new compound, which has a particularly nonreactive aromatic ring, we confirm and extend studies published by other workers indicating the much greater in vivo stability of iodophenyl compounds compared to the more conventional iodophenolic ones. In addition, the <b>aminooxy</b> group of our reagent gives a stable and specific linkage to aldehyde groups formed by periodate oxidation on the sugar moiety of antibody molecules. In vitro, favorable binding activity and high stability was obtained with a (([125 I]iodoaryl) amino) oxy labeled monoclonal antibody directed against carcinoembryonic antigen. In vivo, using paired labeling experiments in nude mice bearing colon carcinoma xenografts, the (([125 I]iodoaryl) amino) oxy-MAb (MAb = monoclonal antibody) was {{compared with the same}} MAb 131 I-labeled by conventional chloramine-T method. Tumor 125 I concentration of (arylamino) oxy MAb (measured as percent injected dose per gram) was significantly higher as compared to values obtained with a conventionally labeled 131 I antibody. Additionally, thyroid uptake, an indicator of iodine release from the antibody, was up to 25 times lower after injection of 125 I-MAb obtained by the new method as compared to the conventionally iodinated 131 I-MAb...|$|E
30|$|Typically the {{introductions}} of 18 F require elevated temperature and organic solvent as reaction conditions, {{which are often}} incompatible with peptide stability. To overcome this limitation, the classical labeling method is usually employed using N-succinimidyl- 4 - [18 F] flourobenzoate (SFB) {{or the use of}} [18 F] fluorobenzaldehyde to react with a <b>aminooxy</b> or hydrazino nicotinamide derivatized peptide (Poethko et al. 2004; Rennen et al. 2007; Bruus-Jensen et al. 2006). As another alternative the “click chemistry” reactions have been studied for labeling of different peptides (Iddon et al. 2011). This pathway requires the use of multi-step protocol that make more cumbersome and with lower yields than direct labeling.|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} and broad applications of nano-magnetic colloids have generated {{much interest in}} recent years. Specially, Fe 304 nanoparticles have attracted {{a great deal of}} attention since their magnetic properties can be used for hyperthermia treatment or drug targeting. For example, enhanced levels of intracellular gene delivery can be achieved using Fe 304 nano-vectors in the presence of an external magnetic field, a process known as 2 ̆ 7 magnetofection 2 ̆ 7. The low cytotoxicity, tunable particle size, ease of surface functionalization, and ability to generate thermal energy using an external alternating magnetic field (AMF) are properties have propelled Fe 304 research to the forefront of nanoparticle research. The strategy of nanoparticle-mediated, AMF-induced heat generation has been used to effect intracellular hyperthermia. One application of this 2 ̆ 7 magnetic hyperthermia 2 ̆ 7 is heat activated local delivery of a therapeutic effector (e. g.; drug or polynucleotide). This thesis describes the development of a magnetic nano-vector for AMF-induced, heat-activated pDNA and small molecule delivery. The use of heat-inducible vectors, such as heat shock protein (hsp) genes, is a promising mode of gene therapy that would restrict gene expression to a local region by focusing a heat stimulus only at a target region. We thus aimed to design an Fe 304 nanoparticle-mediated gene transfer vehicle for AMF-induced localized gene expression. We opted to use 2 ̆ 7 click 2 ̆ 7 oximation techniques to assemble the magnetic gene transfer vector. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis, characterization, and transfection studies of the oxime ether lipid-based nano-magnetic vectors MLP and dMLP. The synthesis and characterization of a novel series of quaternary ammonium <b>aminooxy</b> reagents (2. 1 - 2. 4) is described. These cationic <b>aminooxy</b> compounds were loaded onto nanoparticles for ligation with carbonyl groups and also to impart a net positive charge on the nanoparticle surface. Our studies indicated that the non-toxic magnetoplexes (magnetic nanoparticle + pDNA complex) derived from dMLP deliver pDNA into mammalian cells even without external magnetic assistance. To date, dMLP is the only polymer-free magnetic gene delivery system that can deliver pDNA without any magnetic assistance. Chapter 3 of this thesis outlines the synthesis and characterization of other oxime ether lipids and details studies using derived-lipoplexes. These lipids were evaluated in pDNA and siRNA transfection studies in various mammalian cell lines. This work constitutes the first use of an oxime ether as the linking domain in cationic transfection lipids. These biocompatible oxime ether lipids can be readily assembled by click chemistry through ligation of hydrophobic aldehydes with quaternary ammonium <b>aminooxy</b> salts. Our studies showed that the oxime ether lipids transfected pDNA and siRNA efficiently in MCF - 7, H 1792, and in PAR C 10 cells comparable to and in some cases better than commercial transfection lipids. Chapter 4 describes the design and characterization of a nano-magnetic delivery system for AMF-induced drug (doxorubicin) release. In efforts to develop a magnetic formulation free from thermo sensitive materials, such as hydrogels, we synthesized three nanoparticle-based doxorubicin formulations using charge interactions as the key associative force. To do so, we synthesized and characterized a novel cationic oxime ether conjugate at C- 13 of doxorubicin. Our investigation indicated that the positive charge of the oxime ether drug conjugate tended to bind better to the negatively charged nanoparticle than did the other formulations prepared in stepwise manner. Our findings show that the nano-magnetic formulations remained essestially inactive at body temperature (37. 5 °C) and released a majority of the cargo only when exposed to an external AMF. Our designed magnetic drug delivery platform is the first example of an AMF-inducible system that does not depend on the inclusion of thermo sensitive materials. Finally, we have developed a bioanalytical application of the highly chemoselective oximation chemistry using <b>aminooxy</b> reagent 2. 1. Chapter 5 describes a silica microchip containing micropillars coated with cationic <b>aminooxy</b> reagent 2. 1. The microchip captures gaseous ketones and aldehydes from exhaled human breath. A brief description of microchip fabricated breath analyzer and breath analysis is described in Chapter 5. Our studies showed that the acetone capture efficiency of the aminooxy-loaded microchip was 98...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the preparation of}} the modified chelator aminooxyacetyl-ferrioxamine, and the replacement of its iron atom by 67 Ga at high specific activity. The <b>aminooxy</b> function of this compound was allowed to react with the aldehyde groups generated by the periodate oxidation of the oligosaccharide of a mouse IgG 1 monoclonal antibody (MAb) directed against carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA). The use of the <b>aminooxy</b> group allowed a stable bond to be formed between the chelon and the antibody with no need for reduction. Iron was removed from the ferrioxamine moiety and replaced by 67 Ga either before or after conjugation of the chelon to the antibody. In either case the labelled antibody was injected into nude mice bearing a human colon carcinoma having the appropriate antigenicity. Unoxidized antibody, labelled with 125 I by conventional methods, was co-injected as an internal control. Additional control experiments were carried out with a non-immune IgG using the same 67 Ga-labelled modified chelon as above. The in vivo distribution of the modified antibodies was evaluated at various times between 24 and 96 hr after injection. The methods used were gamma-camera imaging and, more quantitatively, gamma-counting of the various organs after dissection. Interestingly, with the metal-chelon-labelled antibody, the intensity and specificity of tumor labelling was comparable and in some cases superior to the results obtained with radio-iodinated antibody. In particular, there was almost no increase in liver and spleen uptake of radioactive metal relative to radio-iodine, contrary to what has been observed with most antibodies labelled with 111 In after conjugation with DTPA...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Molecules {{that target}} and inhibit αvβ 3, αvβ 5, and α 5 β 1 integrins have {{generated}} great interest {{because of the}} role of these receptors in mediating angiogenesis and metastasis. Attempts to increase the binding affinity and hence the efficacy of integrin inhibitors by dimerization have been marginally effective. In the present work, we achieved this goal by using oxime-based chemical conjugation to synthesize dimers of integrin-binding cystine knot (knottin) miniproteins with low-picomolar binding affinity to tumor cells. A non-natural amino acid containing an <b>aminooxy</b> side chain was introduced at different locations within a knottin monomer and reacted with dialdehyde-containing cross-linkers of different lengths to create knottin dimers with varying molecular topologies.

For intact fruits, deoperculated fruits and true seeds, ethylene was only produced {{after the start}} of radicle emergence. Removal of the operculum or the whole pericarp, likely allowing better water uptake and gas exchange by the true seed, actually increased the time span between the start of radicle emergence and the beginning of ethylene production compared to intact fruits. ACC (1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid), AOA (<b>aminooxy</b> acetic acid), AIB (2 -amino isobutyric acid) and STS (silver thiosulfate) in the imbibition medium did not influence the germination pattern.
