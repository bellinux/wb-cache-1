5|$|Broad {{interest}} in metformin was not rekindled until {{the withdrawal of}} the other biguanides in the 1970s. Metformin was approved in Canada in 1972, but did not receive approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for type 2 diabetes until 1994. Produced under license by Bristol-Myers Squibb, Glucophage was the first branded formulation of metformin to be marketed in the U.S., beginning on March 3, 1995. Generic formulations are now available in several countries, and metformin is believed to have become the world's most widely prescribed <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drug.</b>|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE — To {{describe}} {{the use of}} oral <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> for management of type 2 diabetes in the U. S. from 1990 through 2001. RESEARCHDESIGNANDMETHODS — Data on oral <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> were derived from two pharmaceutical marketing databases from IMS Health, the National Prescription Audit Plus and the National Disease and Therapeutic Index. RESULTS — In 1990, 23. 4 million outpatient prescriptions of oral antidiabetic agents were dispensed. By 2001, this number had increased 3. 9 -fold, to 91. 8 million prescriptions. Glipizide and glyburide, two sulfonylurea medications, accounted for 77 % of prescriptions of oral <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> in 1990 and 35. 5 % of prescriptions in 2001. By 2001, the biguanide met-formin (approved in 1995) had captured 33 % of prescriptions, and the thiazolidinedione insulin sensitizers (rosiglitazone and pioglitazone marketed beginning in 1999) accounted for 17 % of market share. Compared with patients treated in 1990, those in 2001 were propor-tionately younger and they more often used oral <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> and insulin in combination.

40|$|Background: Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) is a {{major public}} health problem in developing countries. Drug utilization study of <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> {{is of paramount importance}} to promote rational drug use in patients with DM and to make available valuable information for the health-care team. Aims & Objective: To determine the prescription pattern of drugs used in the treatment of patients with type 2 DM in outpatient general clinics of Hyderabad. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was carried out by evaluating 600 prescriptions of <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> over a period of 2 month obtained from pharmacy database of five general family clinics. The study assessed prescribing pattern for six classes of antidiabetic drugs: insulin, biguanides, sulfonylureas, glitazones, α-glucosidase inhibitors, and dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP- 4) inhibitors. Results: Of 600 prescriptions evaluated, 349 were of male patients and 251 were of female patients. Frequency of use of <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> as monotherapy was 74. 5 % and as combination therapy was 24. 5 %.

30|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) {{has become}} a worldwide epidemic. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) reported {{that the number of}} adult diabetic patients worldwide is 366 million in November 2011, and it is predicted to increase to 552 million by 2030 [1]. DM is broadly classified into two categories, namely, type 1 and type 2 [2] in which about 90 – 95  % of diabetic patients suffer from type 2 DM [3]. Type 1 DM is due to inability of pancreas to produce insulin; therefore, patients with type 1 DM need regular insulin injection. Type 2 DM is caused by degradation of secreted insulin. This type of DM can be managed by diet control and consumption of various synthetic <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> [4]. Despite their efficacy, commercial <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> are often associated with some undesirable adverse side effects such as flatulence, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dropsy, drug-resistance, weight gain, and heart failure [5 – 8]. Besides, the synthetic drugs are expensive and have poor availability to many rural populations, particularly in developing countries [9]. As a result, the scientific investigation is increasing for the <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> from natural resources with minimal side effects and cheap.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—The uptake {{of drugs}} into hepatocytes {{is a key}} {{determinant}} for hepatic metabolism, intrahepatic action, their subsequent systemic plasma concentrations, and extrahepatic actions. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that many drugs used for treatment of cardiovascular diseases (e. g., oral <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs,</b> statins) are taken up into hepatocytes by distinct organic anion transporters (organic anion transporting polypeptides [OATPs]; gene symbol SLCO/SLC 21) or organic cation transport-ers (OCTs; gene symbol SLC 22). Because most patients with type 2 diabetes receive more than one drug and inhibition of drug transporters has been recognized as a new mechanism underly-ing drug-drug interactions, we tested the hypothesis of whether oral <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> can inhibit the transport mediated by hepatic uptake transporters.

Evidence has emerged that <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> are promising candidates for both life span extension and prevention of cancer.

Furthermore, information relevant for daily clinical practice was to be obtained. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We performed an exploratory TTO modeling study, using a cohort of diabetes mellitus patients. Four parametric distributions (exponential, lognormal, gamma, and Weibull) were compared in terms of their goodness of fit. Covariates that could influence the TTO were investigated. In addition, TTO mean and median values were summarized for use in clinical practice. RESULTS: Overall, the gamma distribution provided the best goodness of fit, although differences with the Weibull distribution were negligible in some instances. No differences in TTO distributions between different <b>antidiabetic</b> <b>drugs</b> for a given ADR were found. The TTO was influenced by suspected concomitant medication for metformin-associated diarrhea. Mean and median TTO values were similar for different drug-ADR combinations.
