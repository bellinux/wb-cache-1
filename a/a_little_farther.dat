The two major regions that grow Tempranillo are Rioja, in north central Spain, and Ribera del Duero, which lies <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>farther</b> to the south. Substantial quantities are also grown in the Penedès, Navarra and Valdepeñas regions.|$|E
25|$|The main defences are entered <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>farther</b> on in {{the same}} line, through a {{projecting}} two-story building which has some fireplaces with very simple and late mouldings. The buildings are of the local basalt, and the masonry is rough rubble; there are, as is so frequently the case, no very clear indications for dating the different parts, which were in all probability erected at different times.|$|E
25|$|By nightfall on 25 October, Hohenlohe's {{main body}} was between Neuruppin and Lindow, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>farther</b> east. General-Major von Schwerin's cavalry and Oberst von Hagen's {{infantry}} brigade marched toward Wittstock. General-Major Rudolf Ernst Christoph von Bila reached Kyritz, north of Neustadt, with a cavalry-infantry brigade. Blücher's rear guard was near Neustadt after a clash with Bernadotte's leading troops. In an ominous development, French cavalry seized Oranienburg before Schimmelpfennig arrived there.|$|E

25|$|PA449 becomes NY19 {{just north}} of Genesee, Pennsylvania, as it runs along the Genesee River through a narrow valley. Just south of the first New York {{community}} it encounters, the hamlet of Shongo in the Town of Willing, it crosses the river. Running <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>farther</b> from the waterway, NY19 reaches another hamlet, Stannards, several miles (kilometers) farther north, along with its first state highway junction, NY248, which leaves to the east.|$|E
25|$|The first {{irrigation}} works undertaken during East India Company's rule were begun in 1817. Consisting chiefly of extensions or reinforcements of previous Indian works, these projects {{were limited to}} the plains north of Delhi and to the river deltas of the Madras Presidency. A small dam in the Kaveri river delta, built some 1,500 years before, and known as the Grand Anicut, was one such indigenous work in South India. In 1835–36, Sir Arthur Cotton successfully reinforced the dam, and his success prompted more irrigation projects on the river. <b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>farther</b> north, on the Tungabhadra river, the 16th century Vijayanagara ruler, Krishna Deva Raya, had constructed several weirs; these too would be extended under British administration.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the blind}} lady points Manni towards the {{homeless}} {{man with his}} money, who passes on the cyclist's bike. Manni chases him with a gun, inadvertently causing a head-on collision between the white BMW, Mr. Meier, {{and the man who}} stole Lola's moped. Mr. Meier, Lola's dad and the thief apparently die in the crash. Manni manages to retrieve his money, trading it for his gun. Lola reaches the supermarket, but cannot find Manni. She shouts his name but there is no response. <b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>farther</b> away, a car pulls up with Manni and Ronnie inside, who shake hands. Manni, no longer in need of the 100,000 marks, asks Lola what is in the bag she is carrying, only for the film to end in a freeze-frame on Lola's reaction.|$|E

After its display on the Wings of a Century stage, the train was taken on a 31-state, 222-city publicity tour. More than 2million people saw the train before it entered revenue service.|$|E
500|$|Robert Story, {{known as}} [...] "the Craven Poet", {{was born at}} Wark on Tweed in 1795. [...] His father was an {{agricultural}} labourer, and the family moved frequently around the Northumberland villages. [...] When just 10 years old, Story ran away to accompany a lame fiddler on an excursion through the Scottish Borders for a month, and {{about a year later}} the family moved to Howtel, where Story attended the local school. [...] He later claimed that this was where [...] "I learned nearly all that I ever learned from a Master—namely to read badly, to write worse, and to cipher <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>farther,</b> perhaps than to the Rule of Three." [...] There he was introduced to Divine Songs for Children, and discovered a love of poetry while reading on the hills, where he was employed as a shepherd. [...] By 1820 he had moved to Gargrave in North Yorkshire where he opened a school, and in 1825 published a volume of poetry, Craven Blossoms. [...] Algernon Percy, the Duke of Northumberland, became a patron in 1857 and financed an edition of his works. [...] In 1859 Story was invited to Ayr for the centenary celebrations of Robert Burns, where he recited his poem on Burns. [...] The Bradfordian considered that [...] "he stands high among the minor poets of Great Britain, and many of his sweet lyrics will most assuredly descend to and be highly admired by posterity, and by none more than Yorkshiremen." ...|$|E

60|$|At <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{distance}} <b>farther</b> on, on {{the other}} side of the crater, and close at the foot of the ridge of earth that surrounds it, there was to be seen a column of dense smoke, or rather of vapor, coming up out of the ground.|$|R
60|$|He {{had ridden}} but <b>a</b> <b>little</b> way <b>farther,</b> {{when he was}} {{convinced}} that the officer was right. The crash of musketry volleys rose continuously, but although the boom of guns was mingled with it, there was nothing like the continuous fire that might have been expected from a twenty-gun battery.|$|R
2500|$|Granger {{set about}} taking the fort by regular {{approaches}} [...] that is, establishing a sequence of trenches or other protective lines drawn ever closer to the objective, until finally its walls could be breached {{and it could be}} taken by assault. His first line was a gift, a line of trenches [...] from the fort that had been prepared by the garrison of the fort and then for some reason abandoned. It was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>farther</b> than he would have liked, but it served quite well. Additional parallels were built with little interference, as the laborers could work behind the sand dunes.|$|E
2500|$|After the Athenian {{victory at}} Cynossema, the Athenian fleet {{established}} a base at Sestos, {{from where it}} could quickly respond to any moves by the Spartan fleet at Abydos. [...] Mindarus, the Spartan navarch, summoned the Syracusan commander Dorieus, with his 14 ships, to join him at Abydos, hoping {{to end the war}} with a decisive victory. [...] Dorieus, accordingly, sailed north from Rhodes towards the Hellespont. [...] Before reaching Abydos, however, he was spotted by Athenian lookouts and driven ashore. [...] Xenophon reports that he was trapped at Rhoeteum, while Diodorus Siculus reports the location as Dardanus; Donald Kagan suggests that Dorieus was driven ashore at Rhoeteum, then managed to advance <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>farther</b> towards Abydos before being trapped a second time at Dardanus.|$|E
2500|$|FlashForward {{received}} generally positive reviews, with a Metacritic {{score of}} 72 out of 100, based on 26 critic reviews. In September 2009, Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle deemed the series [...] "enormously entertaining" [...] with a [...] "tantalizing premise", while Ginia Bellafante of the New York Times wrote that it [...] "begins {{in such a}} spirit of bracing suspense that [...] challenged to recall another pilot that lured [...] so quickly into addiction." [...] Variety Brian Lowry gave a more measured review, opining, [...] "It's an intriguing, mind-bending concept that's mostly well executed [...] there's a solid desire to see more but not such wonderment as to proclaim unwavering fealty until the show peers <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>farther</b> down the road." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker graded the series [...] "B+", stating, [...] "FF isn't perfect. Much thought {{has been given to}} plot and character but not enough to the visuals: This {{is one of the most}} drab-looking of intelligent shows. Thematically, FF makes major philosophical points— living in the moment, etc.—but instead of dramatizing them, it often just has its characters speak them." [...] Tucker described the show as [...] " [...] sci-fi-ish conspiracy suspense with excellent prime-time-soap drama".|$|E

6000|$|... [76] It {{is worth}} while noting here, in {{comparing}} Fig. 66 and Fig. [...] 68, how entirely our judgment of {{some kinds of}} art depends upon [...] knowledge, not on feeling. Any person unacquainted with hills would [...] think Claude's right and Titian's ridiculous: but, after inquiring <b>a</b> [...] <b>little</b> <b>farther</b> into the matter, we find Titian's a careless and [...] intense expression of true knowledge, and Claude's a slow and [...] plausible expression of total ignorance.|$|R

60|$|They had not {{stood there}} long, {{but two of}} the savages {{appeared}} running directly that way, as if they had already notice where they stood, and were coming up to attack them; and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> way <b>farther</b> they espied three more coming after them, and five more beyond them, all coming the same way; besides which, they saw seven or eight more at a distance, running another way; for, in a word, they ran every way, like sportsmen beating for their game.|$|R
