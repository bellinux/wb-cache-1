5|$|The {{surfaces}} {{should be}} broad and simple, {{defined by a}} bold and clear design, accentuated in the important places. The enlargement of the details or their multiplicity is to be feared. By exaggerating the forms, in order to render them more clearly visible, or by enriching them with details, we would destroy {{the proportion of the}} work. Finally, the model, like the design, should have a summarized character, such <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> give to a rapid sketch. Only it is necessary that this character should be the product of volition and study, and that the artist, concentrating his knowledge, should find the form and the line in its greatest simplicity.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately, the {{category}} whose objects are the sets of NF and whose morphisms are the functions between those sets is not cartesian closed; {{this is a}} highly desirable property for any set theory to have. Intuitively, {{it means that the}} functions of NF do not curry <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> normally expect functions to. Furthermore, it means that NF is not a topos.|$|E
25|$|Secular {{aberration}} {{is typically}} {{a small number}} of arcminutes, for example the stationary star Groombridge 1830 is displaced by approximately 3arcminutes, due to secular aberration. This is roughly 8 times the effect of annual aberration, <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> expect since the velocity of the Solar System relative {{to the center of the}} Galaxy is about 8 times the velocity of the Earth relative to the Sun.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Michael Fitzgerald {{disputes}} {{the claim of}} schizophrenia, saying that Wain more likely had Asperger's syndrome (AS). Of particular note, Fitzgerald indicates that while Wain's art took on a more abstract nature as he grew older, his technique and skill as a painter did not diminish, <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> expect from a person with schizophrenia. Moreover, elements of visual agnosia are demonstrated in his painting. If Wain had visual agnosia, it might have manifested itself merely as an extreme attention to detail.|$|E

25|$|Craig Evans {{states that}} an {{argument}} in favor of the partial authenticity of the Testimonium is that the passage does not exaggerate the role played by the Jewish leaders in the death of Jesus. According to Evans, if the passage had been an interpolation after the emergence of conflicts between Jews and Christians, it would have had a more accusative tone, but in its current form reads <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> expect it to read for a passage composed by Josephus {{towards the end of the}} first century.|$|E
25|$|Unlike stroke-based input methods, the pinyin method only {{requires}} {{the user to}} know how to speak Mandarin and be able to recognize the characters. It does not require the user to be able to construct the character from scratch <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> do in writing Chinese. This is both an advantage and a disadvantage. It is an advantage in that {{people will be able to}} type all the characters they can recognize. It is a disadvantage in that it may cause language attrition and skill loss in adults, and it may be a learning barrier for written Chinese in children.|$|E
25|$|According to the Free-radical theory, {{oxidative}} damage initiated by {{reactive oxygen species}} is {{a major contributor to}} the functional decline that is characteristic of aging. While studies in invertebrate models indicate that animals genetically engineered to lack specific antioxidant enzymes (such as SOD), in general, show a shortened lifespan (<b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> expect from the theory), the converse manipulation, increasing the levels of antioxidant enzymes, has yielded inconsistent effects on lifespan (though some studies in Drosophila do show that lifespan can be increased by the overexpression of MnSOD or glutathione biosynthesizing enzymes). Also contrary to this theory, deletion of mitochondrial SOD2 can extend lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans.|$|E

25|$|Chomsky {{explains}} {{his decision to}} focus on criticizing the U.S. over other countries as being because, during his lifetime, the country has militarily and economically dominated the world, and because its liberal democratic electoral system allows for the citizenry to exert an influence on government policy. His hope is that, by spreading awareness of the negative impact that imperialism has on the populations affected by it, he can sway {{the population of the}} U.S. and other countries into opposing government policies that are imperialist in their nature. He urges people to criticize the motivations, decisions, and actions of their governments; to accept responsibility for one's own thoughts and actions; and to apply the same standards to others <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> apply to oneself.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> expect, Metzinger’s {{concept of}} {{painting}} was both {{more sophisticated and}} perceptive than Cézanne, but fundamentally {{the shape of the}} misunderstandings that were to follow Cubism were the same as Cézanne's, and so too were the implications. Metzinger had seen painting as rooted in the experience of nature: four-dimensional and geometric. He stressed this heavily, {{and at the same time}} brought out the flatness and dislocations of Cézanne’s transformations of nature—with the conceptual aspect of multiple perspectives and non-Euclidean spacetime. The importance of Cubism, he accepted, was to emphasize the idea that everything visible (objects) and invisible (consciousness) has an n-dimensional geometric basis (an idea he associated with ‘construct an infinite number of different spaces for the use of painters’).|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} {{complexity}} and time requirements, de-novo assemblies are {{orders of magnitude}} slower and more memory intensive than mapping assemblies. This is mostly {{due to the fact}} that the assembly algorithm needs to compare every read with every other read (an operation that has a naive time complexity of O(n2); using a hash this can be reduced significantly). Referring to the comparison drawn to shredded books in the introduction: while for mapping assemblies one would have a very similar book as template (perhaps with the names of the main characters and a few locations changed), the de-novo assemblies are more hardcore in a sense <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> not know beforehand whether this would become a science book, a novel, a catalogue, or even several books. Also, every shred would be compared with every other shred.|$|E

25|$|For Agha Mohammad Khan, the re-subjugation and {{reintegration}} of Georgia {{into the}} Iranian Empire {{was part of}} the same process that had brought Shiraz, Esfahan, and Tabriz under his rule. He viewed Georgia, like the Safavids and Nader Shah before him, no different from the provinces in mainland Iran, such as Khorasan. As the Cambridge History of Iran states, its permanent secession was inconceivable and had to be resisted in the same way <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> resist an attempt at the separation of Fars or Gilan. It was therefore natural for Agha Mohammad Khan to perform whatever necessary means in the Caucasus in order to subdue and reincorporate the recently lost regions following Nader Shah's death and the collapse of the Zands, including putting down what in Iranian eyes was seen as treason {{on the part of the}} vali of Georgia.|$|E
25|$|The {{advertising}} {{program for the}} Crown Jewels sandwiches featured the slogan Flash, but not too flash which was an inference stating while they cost more than the standard burger offerings at BK, they were not as much <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> expect to pay at a higher end outlet. The products were introduced {{in a series of}} three pairs of commercials in both 15 and 30 second formats. The commercials featured animals such as snails or frogs that are used as exotic cuisine in various regions of the world. As the narrator announces BK is looking for new and more complex ingredients for their new line of sandwiches, the animals are shown reacting in a fearful way believing they are the new ingredients. At the end, the narrator declares one of the new flavors and the animal is relieved to find out they are not food, then they are promptly dispatched by the new food item (e.g. the frog is hit with a mango).|$|E
25|$|The {{language}} of the Amidah most likely comes from the mishnaic period, {{both before and after}} the destruction of the Temple (70 CE) as the probable time of its composition and compilation. In the time of the Mishnah, it was considered unnecessary to prescribe its text and content. This may have been simply because the language was well known to the Mishnah's authors. The Mishnah may also not have recorded a specific text because of an aversion to making prayer a matter of rigor and fixed formula, an aversion that continued at least to some extent throughout the Talmudic period, as evidenced by the opinions of R. Eliezer (Talmud Ber. 29b) and R. Simeon ben Yohai (Ab. ii. 13). R. Jose held that one should include something new in one's prayer every day (Talmud Yerushalmi Ber. 8b), a principle said to have been carried into practice by R. Eleazar and R. Abbahu (ib.). Prayer was not to be read <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> read a letter (ib.).|$|E

25|$|Many {{compounds}} {{of thorium}} are known: {{this is because}} thorium and uranium are the most stable and accessible actinides and are the only actinides that can be studied safely and legally in bulk in a normal laboratory. As such, they have the best-known chemistry of the actinides, along with that of plutonium, as the self-heating and radiation from them {{is not enough to}} cause radiolysis of chemical bonds as it is for the other actinides. While the later actinides from americium onwards are predominantly trivalent and behave more similarly to the corresponding lanthanides, <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> expect from periodic trends, the early actinides up to plutonium (thus including thorium and uranium) have relativistically destabilised and hence delocalised 5f and 6d electrons that participate in chemistry in a similar way to the early transition metals of group 3 through 8: thus, all their valence electrons can participate in chemical reactions, although this is not common for neptunium and plutonium.|$|E
25|$|For Agha Mohammad Khan, the resubjugation and {{reintegration}} of Georgia {{into the}} Iranian Empire {{was part of}} the same process that had brought Shiraz, Isfahan, and Tabriz under his rule. He viewed, like the Safavids and Nader Shah before him, the territories no different than the territories in mainland Iran. Georgia was a province of Iran the same way Khorasan was. As the Cambridge History of Iran states, its permanent secession was inconceivable and had to be resisted in the same way <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> resist an attempt at the separation of Fars or Gilan. It was therefore natural for Agha Mohammad Khan to perform whatever necessary means in the Caucasus in order to subdue and reincorporate the recently lost regions following Nader Shah's death and the demise of the Zands, including putting down what in Iranian eyes was seen as treason {{on the part of the}} wali of Georgia.|$|E
25|$|Afrikaans uses a diaeresis to mark vowels {{that are}} {{pronounced}} separately and not <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> expect where they occur together, for example voel (to feel) {{as opposed to}} voël (bird). The circumflex is used in ê, î, ô and û generally to indicate long close-mid, as opposed to open-mid vowels, for example in the words wêreld (world) and môre (morning, tomorrow). The acute accent is used to add emphasis {{in the same way}} as underlining or writing in bold or italics in English, for example Dit is jóú boek (It is your book). The grave accent is used to distinguish between words that are different only in placement of the stress, for example appel (apple) and appèl (appeal) and in a few cases where it makes no difference to the pronunciation but distinguishes between homophones. The two most usual cases of the latter are the in the sayings òf... òf (either... or) and nòg... nòg (neither... nor) to distinguish them from of (or) and nog (again, still).|$|E
