5|$|As the Alliance was a Step 5 league, {{its member}} clubs were {{eligible}} {{to take part}} in the FA Cup and FA Vase <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> grounds met the required standards. The league also operated two cup competitions of its own, the knock-out League Cup, which was staged every season, and the Joe McGorian Cup, which was contested between the previous season's League Cup winners and league champions and which was first contested in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to expectations, the American bombing effort had not {{pulverized}} the Base Areas and {{had only}} tended to drive PAVN and the NLF deeper into the Cambodian countryside. This series of events began to pose questions for Hanoi. The North Vietnamese {{had been willing to}} maintain the status quo in Cambodia <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> supply lines and sanctuaries were secure. But with the expansion of the war across the border they might have to take further steps to maintain their position.|$|E
5|$|Pterosaurs {{have been}} a staple of popular culture for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> cousins the dinosaurs, though they are usually not {{featured}} as prominently in films, literature or other art. Additionally, while the depiction of dinosaurs in popular media has changed radically in response to advances in paleontology, a mainly outdated picture of pterosaurs has persisted since the mid 20th century.|$|E

5|$|White tigers {{are more}} {{frequently}} bred in captivity, where the comparatively small gene pool {{can lead to}} inbreeding. This has given white tigers a greater likelihood of being born with physical defects, such as cleft palate, scoliosis (curvature of the spine), and strabismus (squint). Even apparently healthy white tigers generally do not live <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> orange counterparts. Attempts {{have been made to}} cross white and orange tigers to remedy this, often mixing with other subspecies in the process.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the authors}} of Islamic Homosexualities argued this did not mean women could not engage in lesbian relationships, a lesbian {{anthropologist}} in 1991 visited Yemen and reported that women in the town she visited were unable to comprehend her romantic relationship to another woman. Women in Pakistan are expected to marry men; {{those who do not}} are ostracized. Women, however, may have intimate relations with other women <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> wifely duties are met, their private matters are kept quiet, and the woman with whom they are involved is somehow related by family or logical interest to her lover.|$|E
5|$|Blackcurrants {{can grow}} well on sandy or heavy loams, or forest soils, <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> {{nutrient}} requirements are met. They prefer damp, fertile but not waterlogged ground and are intolerant of drought. Although the bushes are winter hardy, frosts during the flowering period may adversely affect the yield and cold winds may restrict {{the number of}} flying insects visiting and pollinating the flowers. A pH of about 6 is ideal for blackcurrants and the ground can be limed if the soil is too acidic. Planting is usually done in the autumn or winter to allow the plants to become established before growth starts in the spring, but container-grown stock can be planted {{at any time of}} year.|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} the Belgian's {{attempts}} to delay the Germans for <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> possible, <b>their</b> surrender angered the Allies, whose armies' north-western flank was now vulnerable to German attack. French civilians became increasingly hostile to Belgians in their midst.|$|R

5|$|Historian Nancy Rabinowitz {{argues that}} ancient Greek red vase images portraying women {{with their arms}} around another woman's waist, or leaning on a woman's {{shoulders}} can be construed as expressions of romantic desire. Much of {{the daily lives of}} women in ancient Greece is unknown, specifically their expressions of sexuality. Although men participated in pederastic relationships outside marriage, there is no clear evidence that women were allowed or encouraged to have same-sex relationships before or during marriage <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> marital obligations were met. Women who appear on Greek pottery are depicted with affection, and in instances where women appear only with other women, their images are eroticized: bathing, touching one another, with dildos placed in and around such scenes, and sometimes with imagery also seen in depictions of heterosexual marriage or pederastic seduction. Whether this eroticism is for the viewer or an accurate representation of life is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The result {{confirmed}} the worries of some, including Spaak, {{that the vote}} would not be sufficiently decisive in either direction and could divide the country along regional and linguistic lines. On 13 March, Eyskens traveled to Pregny to attempt to encourage Leopold to abdicate. Paul Van Zeeland and Spaak attempted to broker a new agreement by which Leopold would abdicate in favour of his son. On 15 April 1950, Leopold {{announced that he was}} willing to temporarily delegate his authority. Many within the PSC–CVP realised that, despite the referendum's result, their party's lack of a parliamentary majority would undermine their ability to build a national reconciliation around the King <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> Liberal coalition partners and Socialist opponents were unwilling to accept the King's return.|$|E
5|$|From the 1994–95 to 2013–14 seasons the Regional League, {{along with}} the Midland Football Combination, served {{as one of the}} two {{official}} feeders to the Midland Football Alliance. The highest-placed team which met the Alliance's entry requirements was promoted to the Alliance, and one or more teams were relegated into the Regional League from the Alliance depending on the number of clubs remaining in each league. (These requirements were inherited by the second Midland League; see last paragraph.) Prior to the 2006–07 season, the league was defined as a step 7 league within the National League System, even though it fed into the Alliance, which was graded as step 5. In 2006 the Regional League was re-graded by the Football Association as a step 6 league. Teams in the top two divisions are eligible {{to take part in the}} FA Cup and FA Vase <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> grounds meet the required standards.|$|E

5|$|In the {{majority}} of species of caecilians, the young are produced by vivipary. Typhlonectes compressicauda, a species from South America, is typical of these. Up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time. They are elongated and have paired sac-like gills, small eyes and specialised scraping teeth. At first, they feed on the yolks of the eggs, but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct. This stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in lipids and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall. They may increase their length sixfold and be two-fifths <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> <b>their</b> mother before being born. By this time they have undergone metamorphosis, lost their eyes and gills, developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles, and reabsorbed their teeth. A permanent set of teeth grow through soon after birth.|$|E

25|$|Animal aerial {{locomotion}} can {{be divided}} into two categories—powered and unpowered. In unpowered modes of locomotion, the animal uses aerodynamics forces exerted on the body due to wind or falling through the air.
