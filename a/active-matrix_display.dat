50|$|Thin-film {{transistors}} {{are usually}} used for constructing an active matrix {{so that the}} two terms are often interchanged, even though a thin-film transistor is just one component in an active matrix and some active-matrix designs have used other components such as diodes. Whereas a passive matrix display uses a simple conductive grid to apply a voltage to the liquid crystals in the target area, an <b>active-matrix</b> <b>display</b> uses a grid of transistors and capacitors {{with the ability to}} hold a charge for a limited period of time. Because of the switching action of transistors, only the desired pixel receives a charge, and the pixel acts as a capacitor to hold the charge until the next refresh cycle, improving image quality over a passive matrix. This is a special version of a sample-and-hold circuit.|$|E

Here, we describe the manufacture of printable elastic conductors comprising single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) uniformly dispersed in a fluorinated rubber. Using an ionic liquid and jet-milling, we produce long and fine SWNT bundles that can form well-developed conducting networks in the rubber.

Integration is key Until now, semiconductor microdisplays were incapable of delivering video images because only one row of a monolithic µLED array could be accessed at any one time, making the task of connecting the huge number of required drive circuits within the array nearly impossible. But these roadblocks were overcome through three key developments: 1) fabrication of low-contact-resistance µLEDs with a 12 µm pixel size; 2) design and fabrication of an active-matrix driver IC through a CMOS process; and 3) hybrid integration of an InGaN µLED array with a silicon CMOS IC chip using flip-chip bonding with tiny 6 -µm-diameter indium bumps.

40|$|The {{amorphous}} {{oxide semiconductor}} Indium-Gallium-Zinc-Oxide (a-IGZO) {{has gained a}} large technological relevance as a semiconductor for thin-film transistors in <b>active-matrix</b> <b>displays.</b> Yet, major questions remain unanswered regarding the atomic origin of threshold voltage control, doping level, hysteresis, negative bias stress (NBS), and negative bias illumination stress (NBIS). We undertake a systematic study {{of the effects of}} oxygen vacancies on the properties of a-IGZO by relating experimental observations to microscopic insights gained from first-principle simulations. It is found that the amorphous nature of the semiconductor allows unusually large atomic relaxations. In some cases, oxygen vacancies are found to behave as perfect shallow donors without the formation of structural defects. Once structural defects are formed, their transition states can vary upon charge and discharge cycles. We associate this phenomenon to a possible presence of hysteresis in the transfer curve of the devices. Under NBS, the creation of oxygen vacancies becomes energetically very stable, hence thermodynamically very likely. This generation process is correlated with the occurrence of the negative bias stress instabilities observed in a-IGZO transistors. While oxygen vacancies can therefore be related to NBS and hysteresis, it appears unlikely from our results that they are direct causes of NBIS, contrary to common belief. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Polycrystalline silicon {{is a key}} {{component}} of integrated circuit technology, micromechanical systems and displays. High-mobility silicon thin-film transistors are replacing amorphous-silicon transistors in advanced <b>active-matrix</b> <b>displays,</b> and are also vital to the emerging fields of microsensors and microactuators [1]. In this study, the deposition processes of silicon thin films were carefully studied and the basic kinetics were analyzed. The films were patterned into submicron islands and the relation of the deposition temperature versus the crystallinity of silicon islands was observed. A “threshold ” deposition temperature for silicon crystals larger than 0. 35 µm was found. The relationships of silicon crystal sizes vs. annealing temperature and vs. annealing duration were also systematically studied. Silicon islands of ~ 0. 1 µm lateral dimensions were successfully fabricated by e-beam lithography and several types of annealings were performed to increase micro-crystal size, with the goal of creating single-crystal high-mobility islands. Theoretically, transistors built from such islands should match the performance of state-of-the-art bulk devices. The crystal size was measured using Transmission Electron Microscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy analysis. Finally, Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure measurements at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lab were employed to study the crystallization processes of silicon films and the correlation between the absorption curves, the thin-film electrical properties and the silicon grain sizes...|$|R

40|$|Self-organization in many soln. -processed, {{semiconducting}} conjugated polymers {{results in}} complex microstructures, in which ordered microcryst. domains {{are embedded in}} an amorphous matrix. This has important consequences for the elec. properties of these materials: charge transport is usually limited by the most difficult hopping processes and is therefore dominated by the disordered matrix, resulting in low charge-carrier mobility (? 10 - 5 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1). Here, the authors use thin-film FET transistor structures to probe the transport properties of the ordered microcryst. domains in the conjugated polymer poly(3 -hexylthiophene), P 3 HT. Self-organization in P 3 HT results in a lamella structure with two-dimensional conjugated sheets formed by interchain stacking.

Optical spectroscopy of the field-induced charge, combined with the mobility anisotropy, reveals the two-dimensional interchain character of the polaronic charge carriers, which exhibit lower relaxation energies than the corresponding radical cations on isolated one-dimensional chains.

40|$|One of {{the main}} drivers for organic {{electronic}} research are the backplanes for flexible <b>active-matrix</b> <b>displays</b> using organic light-emitting diodes (AM-OLEDs). In our work, we processed organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) at low temperatures (< 160 degrees C) on poly(ethylene naphthalate) (PEN) foils. There are several challenges in the integration of OLEDs on top of OTFT backplanes on a foil. One {{of them is the}} interlayer between the OTFT backplane and the OLEDs. For this layer, low-temperature crosslinkable, chemically resistant polymers are required, which, on the one hand, provide proper electrical insulation to OTFT and OLED devices and, on the other hand, can be processed reliably and provide good adhesion to the OLED anode. From the point of reflectivity and, therefore, light emission efficiency, Ag would be a preferred option. The challenge from the processing point of view is the poor adhesion of evaporated or e-beam deposited Ag on most surfaces. Commonly used microelectronic approaches such as sputtered metal or Ar pre-sputtering cannot be applied because of resulting surface leakage paths on the organic dielectric caused by dangling bonds. To address this issue, we tested a variety of low-temperature crosslinkable polymers (e. g., SU- 8, parylene) regarding adhesion, roughness and processability and we measured the adhesion of the Ag deposited at different thicknesses using the Scotch tape test (ASTM D 3359).

More attention was paid to this research field when “the discovery and development of conductive polymers” was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2000. Electronic devices that rely on tailor-made material functionalities, the ability of solution processing and low-cost manufacturing on flexible substrates by traditional printing techniques are among the key features in organic electronics. The common theme while exploring organic electronics, and the focus of this thesis, is that (semi-) conducting polymers serve as active materials to define the principle of operation in devices. This thesis reviews two kinds of organic electronic devices. The first part describes electrochemical devices based on conducting polymers.
