40|$|Depth {{functions}} {{are increasingly being}} used in building nonparametric outlier detectors and in constructing useful nonparametric statistics such as depth-weighted L-statistics. Robustness of a depth function is an essential property for such applications. Here, robustness of three key depth functions, the spatial, simplicial, and generalized Tukey, is explored via the influence function (IF) approach. For all three depths, the IFs are derived and found to be bounded, an important robustness property, and are applied to evaluate two other robustness features, gross error sensitivity and local shift sensitivity. These IFs are also used as components of the IFs of associated depth-weighted L-statistics, for which through a standard approach consistency and asymptotic normality are then derived. In turn, the asymptotic normality is applied to obtain <b>asymptotic</b> <b>relative</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> For spatial depth, two forms of weight function suggested in the recent literature are considered and <b>asymptotic</b> <b>relative</b> <b>efficiencies</b> {{in comparison with the}} mean obtained.
