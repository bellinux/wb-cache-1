40|$|Viruses {{must remain}} {{infectious}} while in harsh extracellular environments. An {{important aspect of}} viral particle stability for double-stranded DNA viruses is the energetically unfavorable state of the tightly confined DNA chain within the virus capsid creating pressures of tens of atmospheres. Here, we study the influence of internal genome pressure on the thermal stability of viral particles. Using differential scanning calorimetry to monitor genome loss upon heating, we find that internal pressure destabilizes the virion, resulting in <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> barrier to trigger DNA release. These experiments are complemented by plaque assay and electron microscopy measurements to {{determine the influence of}} intra-capsid DNA pressure on the rates of viral infectivity loss. At higher temperatures (65 - 75 °C), failure to retain the packaged genome is the dominant mechanism of viral inactivation. Conversely, at lower temperatures (40 - 55 °C), a separate inactivation mechanism dominates, which results in non-infectious particles that still retain their packaged DNA. Most significantly, both mechanisms of infectivity loss are directly influenced by internal DNA pressure, with higher pressure resulting in a more rapid rate of inactivation at all temperatures...|$|E
40|$|The {{arguments}} {{for and against}} a single-molecule rotation mechanism for dielectric relaxation of water are surveyed. It is concluded that two distinct molecular mechanisms are operative in water. Single-molecule rotation is faster than the Debye relaxation time, τD, and possesses <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy.</b> It governs the abnormally fast proton mobility in water. The temperature dependence of τD agrees with that of water self-diffusion assuming a water hopping distance of 3. 3 Å, the separation between an occupied and unoccupied corners of a cube binding the pentawater tetrahedron. This slower translational mechanism controls the ordinary transport phenomena in water. “Tetrahedral displacement ” correlates with two tetrahedral normal modes: the antisymmetric stretch in extended tetrahedral structures at low temperatures and a torsion mode in loosely bound tetrahedra at high temperatures. The temperature dependence of the 180 cm- 1 Raman band is in quantitative agreement with the activation energy for water reorientation and, {{in the framework of}} a twodimensional model, also explains the activation energy for τD. Important information on solvent response times comes from dielectric relaxation measurements. 1 Many dynamical processes, such as proton mobility, charge recombination, and transient solvation, are interpreted in terms of the Debye relaxation time...|$|E

In addition, chlorine monoxide was generated on the surface when molecular oxygen was adsorbed horizontally into a hollow site immediately adjacent to atomic chlorine. Our calculations indicate that while chlorine is easily adsorbed dissociatively on the clean Cu(100) surface, it is stable in the molecular form in the presence of atomic oxygen.

40|$|A {{molecular}} {{model of}} silica nanoparticles grafted with poly(ethylene oxide) oligomers {{has been developed}} for predicting the transport properties of nanoparticle organic-hybrid materials (NOHMs). Ungrafted silica nanoparticles in a medium of poly(ethylene oxide) oligomers were also simulated to clarify the effect of grafting on the dynamics of nanoparticles and chains. The model approximates nanoparticles as solid spheres and uses a united-atom representation for chains, including torsional and bond-bending interactions. The calculated viscosities from Green-Kubo relationships and temperature extrapolation are of the same order of magnitude as experimental data but show <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> relative to real NOHMs systems. Grafted systems have higher viscosities, smaller diffusion coefficients, and slower chain dynamics than the ungrafted ones at high temperatures. At lower temperatures, grafted systems exhibit faster dynamics for both nanoparticles and chains relative to ungrafted systems, because of lower aggregation of particles and enhanced correlations between nanoparticles and chains. This agrees with the experimental observation that NOHMs have liquidlike behavior {{in the absence of}} a solvent. For both grafted and ungrafted systems at low temperatures, increasing chain length reduces the volume fraction of nanoparticles and accelerates the dynamics. However, at high temperatures, longer chains slow down nanoparticle diffusion. From the Stokes-Einstein relationship, it was determined that the coarse-grained treatment of nanoparticles leads to slip on the nanoparticle surfaces. Grafted systems obey the Stokes-Einstein relationship over the temperature range simulated, but ungrafted systems display deviations from it. © 2012 American Chemical Society...|$|E

From thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the K-substituted samples lose weight above 100 °C and are hygroscopic at room temperature; the oxygen vacancies are concentrated at the in-plane O 3 and O 5 sites and those in the terminal O 2 or O 4 are responsible for a 2 D oxide-ion conductivity between the M 3 O 9 complexes. The Na-substituted samples lose little weight by 800 °C and are not hygroscopic; the oxygen vacancies are located at all oxygen atom positions, being more pronounced at the in-plane O 3 and O 5; those in the terminal oxygen sites give an excellent oxide-ion conductivity.

The numerical study supports both the qualitative picture of the reaction dynamics and the rate constant expressions obtained analytically. For those cases where the Langer theory has a restricted range of applicability because of the change in the reaction dynamics scenario, this fact has been numerically demonstrated, Here the Langer expression for the rate constant is replaced by the one obtained {{as a result of the}} consideration of the effective one-dimensional problem along the solvent coordinate, characterized by <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> than that in the initial problem.

We conclude that the peak at 95 K in the DLTS spectra in the case of the heavier ions is due to a different defect, confirming earlier reports in the literature. This defect is negatively charged, unlike VO, which is acceptor-like. We are also able to observe VOH in samples where VO is not present, after these samples have been annealed.

Corrections {{have been made in the}} measured rate constants to compensate for differences in the excited state lifetimes due to tRNA identity, buffer conditions, and temperature. The resulting rate constants are related to the rate at which the s 4 U 8 and C 13 come into the alignment needed for photoreaction; this depends on an activation energy, attributable to the conformational potential energy that occurs during the photoreaction, and on the extent of the structural change.

Two four-membered carbene rings resulting from the [2 + 2] cycloadditions exist; the most stable of the two adducts lies 29 kcal/mol above 1 and is also an intermediate in the rearrangement of 1 to phosphaziridine 2 having an exocyclic C=C double bond (6 kcal/mol above 1), The isomer with an exocyclic C=P bond (3) lies 16 kcal/mol above 1, Overall our results suggest that the [2 + 1] approach is the dominating mechanism of the HN=C + H 2 C=PH reaction, The participation of the [2 + 2] cycloaddition in the transformation can be ruled out. The [2 + 1] cycloaddition giving 1 is also the rate-determining step, Owing {{to the fact that the}} rearrangement 1 [...] > 2 requires <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> and that the energy difference between 1 and 2 is small (6 kcal/mol), 2 could be formed as a minor product, Thus, the reaction differs fundamentally from that involving the isoelectronic HN=C + H 2 C=SiH 2 system where a four-membered carbene has been found to have a high stability, Protonating the phosphorus atom substantially stabilizes the cyclic structures, The four-membered carbene is stabilized by about 9 kcal/mol relative to the neutral structure 1 a, Nevertheless, the only thermodynamically favored process in the HN=C + H 2 C=PH 2 + system is a C-nucleophilic addition giving an open nitrilium cation which is by far the most stable protonated species. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} instability {{mechanisms in}} amorphous In-Ga-Zn-O transistors based on bias and illumination stress-recovery experiments coupled with analysis using stretched exponentials and inverse Laplace transform {{to retrieve the}} distribution of <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> associated with metastable oxygen defects. Results show that the recovery process after illumination stress is persistently slow by virtue of defect states with a broad range, 0. 85 [*]eV to 1. 38 [*]eV, suggesting the presence of ionized oxygen vacancies and interstitials. We also rule out charge trapping/detrapping events since this requires <b>a</b> much <b>smaller</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> ~ 0. 53 [*]eV, and which tends to be much quicker. These arguments are supported by measurements using a novel gate-pulse spectroscopy probing technique that reveals the post-stress ionized oxygen defect profile, including anti-bonding states within the conduction band...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} for the crystal growth of alkaline-earth palladate CaPd 3 O 4 was developed. The {{crystals}} were synthesized on a voltage-applied electrode in a molten chloride solvent. The maximum {{length of the}} crystal was about 1. 5 mm. The X-ray diffraction data were refined well by assuming a cubic structure of the space group Pm n, and the lattice constant a was 5. 7471 (10) Å. The temperature dependence of the resistivity showed semiconductor-like characteristics with <b>a</b> very <b>small</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> Ea of 0. 45 meV at low temperatures, and the resistivity at 300 K was 0. 1 cm. The temperature dependence of the molar magnetic susceptibility showed the Curie-Weiss paramagnetic behavior with <b>a</b> <b>small</b> molar Curie constant Cmol of 5. 0 (1) × 10 - 3 emu K/(mol Oe), indicating the existence of localized spin moments...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{mechanism}} of CO oxidation on O-precovered Pd(111) surfaces by means of fast x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The oxygen overlayer is compressed upon CO coadsorption from a p(2 x 2) structure into a (root 3 x root 3) R 30 degrees structure and then into a p(2 x 1) structure with increasing CO coverage. These three O phases exhibit distinctly different reactivities. (1) The p(2 x 2) phase does not react with CO unless the surface temperature is sufficiently high (< 290 K). (2) In the (root 3 x root 3) R 30 degrees phase, the reaction occurs exclusively at island peripheries. CO molecules in a high-density phase formed under CO exposure react with oxygen atoms, leading to quite <b>a</b> <b>small</b> apparent <b>activation</b> <b>energy.</b> (3) The reaction proceeds uniformly over the islands in the p(2 x 1) phase...|$|R
40|$|Multiscale atomistic {{simulations}} {{were used}} to. understand {{the factors that}} determine the charge carrier mobility spectrum obtained from time-resolved terahertz (THz) spectroscopy in conjugated polymers. The simulation approach combines classical molecular dynamics simulations of atomic structure, large-scale electronic structure calculations, and {{the evaluation of the}} THz mobility using Kubo's linear response formula. We found that THz radiation probes a single carrier hop at low temperatures and high frequencies, while the transport over somewhat longer distances is probed in the opposite cases. Our results indicate that charge carrier transport at THz frequencies is thermally activated but with <b>a</b> much <b>smaller</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> compared to the dc case. The shape of the real and imaginary part of the mobility spectral curve reveals the presence of above THz hopping rates that are relevant for charge carrier transport. Strong differences of the mobilities in the polymer and the corresponding monomer material are largely caused by stronger energetic disorder of the monomer material...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA four-step {{reaction}} mechanism is {{proposed for the}} H- 2 dissociation over pure ceria and gallium promoted mixed oxide materials, in a combined experimental and computational investigation. Two samples of cerium-gallium mixed oxides with Ce/Ga atomic ratios equal to 90 / 10 and 80 / 20 were studied by time-resolved diffuse reflectance infrared spectroscopy under H- 2 (O- 2) flow at isothermal condition {{in the range of}} 523 - 623 K. X-ray photoelectron spectrometry allowed to conclude that only Ce 4 + is reduced to Ce 3 + (Ga 3 + is not reduced), in agreement with density functional theory (DFT) results. The time evolution profiles of gallium hydride (Ga-H) species, hydroxyl groups (OH) and Ce 3 + infrared signals were analyzed and kinetic rate parameters for each step were obtained by mathematical modeling. The values for <b>activation</b> <b>energies</b> were in agreement with those calculated by DFT, for the different elementary pathways. <b>A</b> <b>small</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> (similar to 4 kcal/mol) was found for H- 2 dissociation found on Ga center dot center dot center dot O-Ce sites assuming that the heterolytic cleavage of the H-H bond is the rate determining step. On pure ceria, the experimental <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> is 23 kcal/mol, showing that the addition of Ga 3 + cations boosts the splitting of Hy. Interestingly, the reduction step of pure CeO 2 surface domains seems to proceed via a CeH/OH pair intermediate, according to DFT calculations. Moreover, Ga- 71 NMR experiments indicate the possible presence of gallia nanodomains. It is proposed that the generation of Ga center dot center dot center dot O-Ce sites in the perimeter of such surface gallia nanodomains is responsible for the enhanced reactivity of the mixed materials. The key role of this new type of sites to improve the efficiency of relevant catalytic reactions such as selective alkyne hydrogenation and light alkane dehydrogenation is then analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Naturally formed CdTe/CdS core/shell {{quantum dot}} (QD) {{structures}} {{in the presence of}} surface stabilizing agents have been synthesized by a hydrothermal method. Size and temperature dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectra have been investigated to understand the exciton-phonon interaction, and radiative and nonradiative relaxation of carriers in these QDs. The PL of these aqueous CdTe QDs (3. 0 - 4. 8 nm) has been studied in the temperature range 15 - 300 K. The strength of the exciton-LO-phonon coupling, as reflected in the Huang-Rhys parameter `S' is found to increase from 1. 13 to 1. 51 with the QD size varying from 4. 8 to 3. 0 nm. The PL linewidth (FWHM) increases with increase in temperature and is found to have a maximum in the case of QDs of 3. 0 nm in size, where the exciton-acoustic phonon coupling coefficient is enhanced to 51 mu eV K- 1, compared to the bulk value of 0. 72 mu eV K- 1. To understand the nonradiative processes, which affect the relaxation of carriers, the integrated PL intensity is observed as a function of temperature. The integrated PL intensity remains constant until 50 K for relatively large QDs (3. 9 - 4. 8 nm) beyond which a thermally activated process takes over. Below 150 K, <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>activation</b> <b>energy,</b> 45 - 19 meV, is found to be responsible for the quenching of the PL. Above 150 K, the thermal escape from the dot assisted by scattering with multiple longitudinal optical (LO) phonons is the main mechanism for the fast quenching of the PL. Besides this high temperature quenching, interestingly for relatively smaller size QDs (3. 4 - 3. 0 nm), the PL intensity enhances as the temperature increases up to 90 - 130 K, which is attributed to the emission of carriers from interface/trap states having an <b>activation</b> <b>energy</b> in the range of 6 - 13 meV...|$|R
