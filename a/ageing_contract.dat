30|$|Next the PH {{assumption}} is {{tested for the}} base specification, the final Cox model and the Cox model with interactions. For the Cox model to be valid and to satisfy the PH assumption, the global PH test must return p-values above the threshold of 10 percent. The global PH test reports for the three regressions p-values of 0.000, rejecting the PH assumption and making the Cox model invalid 30. While UISA affiliation and education {{suggest that there is}} no evidence of non-proportionality in the base specification, gender, <b>age</b> and <b>contract</b> type report p-values below the 10 percent threshold. In the final Cox model various variables have low p-values: UISA affiliation, gender, <b>age,</b> <b>contract</b> type, and the income dummies. The results are similar for the interaction model, except for UISA affiliation and gender, where the p-values are above the threshold value. A stratified Cox model presents a possible solution when certain covariates do not satisfy the PH assumption (Ata & Sözer 2007).|$|R
30|$|I {{apply the}} {{stratified}} {{model to the}} data: after testing different sets of stratified regressions, I stratify contract type in the base specification, and <b>age,</b> <b>contract</b> type and hours in the final model and the interaction model. The global PH tests return a p-value of 0.182 for the base specification, a p-value of 0.813 for the final model and a p-value of 0.717 for the interaction model, rejecting the evidence of non-proportionality. Using the stratified Cox model is therefore more appropriate for the data. The coefficients of UISA affiliation remain similar, suggesting quantitatively comparable effects {{as in the previous}} Cox regression Table 31.|$|R

50|$|Up to sixteen {{players who}} were on an AFL list, but were out of {{contract}} {{at the end of}} the season. Again, these players could be recruited at the end of either 2011 or 2012, with no more than sixteen players recruited in this manner over the two years, and no more than one player recruited from any other club. Clubs who lost players in this manner received compensatory selections in the national draft; the number and value of these selections was determined based on <b>age,</b> <b>contract</b> size, on-field performance and draft order, and were permitted to be used in any year between 2011-2015.|$|R

30|$|I {{start the}} {{multiple}} Cox regressions by specifying a base specification. I {{expect the following}} variables {{to have an effect}} on the decision of remaining in employment: gender, <b>age,</b> <b>contract</b> type and education. All variables are statistically significant at the 1 percent level, except for age significant at the 5 percent level. The education dummies are collectively significant at the 1 percent level. While UISA affiliation, female, and a temporary contract increase the hazard of leaving employment, the hazard decreases with age and a higher educational level. With a coefficient of 0.282 the effect of the UISA variable is similar to the simple regression, translating into a hazard ratio of 1.327, or a 32.7 percent increase in the hazard of terminating employment.|$|R
