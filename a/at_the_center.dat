50|$|An Arakawa D-grid is a 90° {{rotation}} of an Arakawa C-grid. E.g., instead of evaluating the v velocity components <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> of <b>the</b> upper/lower grid faces and the u velocity components <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> of <b>the</b> right/left grid faces, one would evaluate the v velocity components <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> of <b>the</b> right/left grid faces and the u velocity components <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> of <b>the</b> upper/lower grid faces.|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "staggered" [...] Arakawa C-grid further {{separates}} {{evaluation of}} vector quantities {{compared to the}} Arakawa B-grid. e.g., instead of evaluating both east-west (u) and north-south (v) velocity components <b>at</b> <b>the</b> grid <b>center,</b> one might evaluate <b>the</b> u components <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> of <b>the</b> left and right grid faces, and <b>the</b> v components <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> of <b>the</b> upper and lower grid faces.|$|R
5|$|Yongle demoted Nanjing to a {{secondary}} capital and in 1403 announced the new capital of China {{was to be}} at his power base in Beijing. Construction of a new city there lasted from 1407 to 1420, employing {{hundreds of thousands of}} workers daily. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> was the political node of the Imperial City, and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of this was the Forbidden City, the palatial residence of the emperor and his family. By 1553, the Outer City was added to the south, which brought the overall size of Beijing to 4 by 4½ miles.|$|E
5|$|A {{much larger}} galaxy cluster is the redshift-0.0354 Abell 2063. The cluster {{is thought to}} be {{interacting}} with the nearby galaxy group MKW 3s, based on radial velocity measurements of galaxies and the positioning of the cD galaxy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of Abell 2063. The active galaxy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of MKW 3s—NGC 5920—appears to be creating a bubble of hot gas from its radio activity. Near the 5th-magnitude star Pi Serpentis lies AWM 4, a cluster containing an excess of metals in the intracluster medium. The central galaxy, NGC 6051, is a radio galaxy that is probably responsible for this enrichment. Similar to AWM 4, the cluster Abell 2052 has central cD radio galaxy, 3C 317. This radio galaxy is believed to have restarted after a period of inactivity less than 200 years ago. The galaxy has over 40,000 known globular clusters, the highest known total of any galaxy as of 2002.|$|E

5|$|Because it {{catered to}} gay people, the bar became a {{flashpoint}} for the nascent homophile movement.

5|$|Galileo's {{discovery}} {{proved the}} importance of the telescope as a tool for astronomers by showing that there were objects in space to be discovered that until then had remained unseen by the naked eye. More importantly, the discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than Earth dealt a blow to the then-accepted Ptolemaic world system, which held that Earth was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the universe and all other celestial bodies revolved around it. Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger), which announced celestial observations through his telescope, does not explicitly mention Copernican heliocentrism, a theory that placed the Sun <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> of the universe. Nevertheless, Galileo accepted the Copernican theory.|$|E
