5|$|Malawi {{has adopted}} task {{shifting}} strategies {{to overcome the}} shortage of workers available for HIV/AIDS treatment and care. Task shifting, which {{has been successful in}} many other regions, involves training less specialized health workers to perform health-related tasks that do not require professional training, such as the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. For example, at Thyolo District Hospital, health workers spend one week learning how to initiate antiretroviral therapy in a classroom setting and an additional two weeks practicing their knowledge in a supervised clinical setting; after completing this course, they are legally (under Ministry of Health guidelines) allowed to initiate antiretroviral therapy. <b>Another</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> task shifting involves training health-oriented counselors in HIV testing and counseling, which relieves nurses of this additional task.|$|E
5|$|Though three-faced Vishnu {{images from}} the Mathura school exist from the Gupta period, not a single four-faced Vaikuntha Chaturmurti from this era is found till day. It is {{suggested}} by scholars that the three-faced Vishnu images {{should be considered as}} Vaikuntha Chaturmurti too, where the fourth head was dropped by sculptors just for sake of convenience. An alternate theory dates Jayakhya-Samhita to c. 600-850 CE and suggests that the three-faced Vishnu images of Gupta era as well as Gupta icons of Vishvarupa (<b>another</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> Vishnu) inspired the iconography of the Vaikuntha Chaturmurti, which developed in Kashmir in the 8th century and attached the fourth head {{on the back of the}} older icon of a three-faced Vishnu.

5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is common}} amongst spiders, both in luring prey and stealthily {{approaching}} predators. One {{case is the}} golden orb weaver (Nephila clavipes), which spins a conspicuous golden colored web in well-lit areas. Experiments show that bees are able to associate the webs with danger when the yellow pigment is not present, as occurs in less well-lit areas where the web is much harder to see. Other colors were also learned and avoided, but bees seemed least able to effectively associate yellow pigmented webs with danger. Yellow {{is the color of}} many nectar bearing flowers, however, so perhaps avoiding yellow is not worth while. <b>Another</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> mimicry is based not on color but pattern. Species such as Argiope argentata employ prominent patterns {{in the middle of their}} webs, such as zigzags. These may reflect ultraviolet light, and mimic the pattern seen in many flowers known as nectar guides. Spiders change their web day to day, which can be explained by bees' ability to remember web patterns. Bees are able to associate a certain pattern with a spatial location, meaning the spider must spin a new pattern regularly or suffer diminishing prey capture.|$|E
5|$|Although St. Louis {{enforced}} {{a variety}} of Jim Crow laws, the area generally had {{a lower level of}} racial violence and fewer lynchings than the American South. The St. Louis black community was stable and relatively concentrated along the riverfront or near the railroad yards. Although informal discrimination had existed in the St. Louis housing market {{since the end of the}} Civil War, only in 1916 did St. Louis pass a residential segregation ordinance. The ordinance quickly was invalidated by court injunctions, but private restrictive covenants in St. Louis real estate transactions limited the ability of white owners to sell to blacks and were <b>another</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> racial discrimination. In 1948 the U.S. Supreme Court overturned such real estate limitations as unconstitutional in Shelley v. Kraemer, a court case based on the sale of a St. Louis house (the Shelley House) to a black family.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> {{acoustic}} communication is the headslap. This typically starts with an {{animal in the}} water elevating its snout and remaining stationary. After some time, the jaws are opened sharply then clamped shut with a biting motion that makes a loud slapping sound, and this is immediately followed by a loud splash, after which the head may be submerged and copious bubbles produced. Some species then roar, while others slap the water with their tails. Episodes of headslapping spread through the group. The purpose varies, {{but it seems to}} be associated with maintaining social relationships, and is also used in courtship. Dominant individuals may also display their body size while swimming at the water surface, and a subordinate will submit by holding its head at an acute angle with the jaws open before retreating underwater.|$|E

5|$|As {{recreational}} facilities and grass ovals were sparse in densely populated Fitzroy, Merv {{and his younger}} brothers played cricket in a cobblestone laneway between their terraced house.

The group also played Australian rules football, kicking around rolled up cardboard and newspaper.

The surface also had a V-shaped slope inwards towards the centre of the lane, causing balls to deviate sideways after bouncing.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to dualism, monism {{does not accept}} any fundamental divisions. The fundamentally disparate nature of reality has been central to forms of eastern philosophies for over two millennia. In Indian and Chinese philosophy, monism is integral to how experience is understood. Today, the most common forms of monism in Western philosophy are physicalist. Physicalistic monism asserts that the only existing substance is physical, in some sense of that term to be clarified by our best science. However, a variety of formulations (see below) are possible. <b>Another</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> monism, idealism, states that the only existing substance is mental. Although pure idealism, {{such as that of}} George Berkeley, is uncommon in contemporary Western philosophy, a more sophisticated variant called panpsychism, according to which mental experience and properties may be at the foundation of physical experience and properties, has been espoused by some philosophers such as Alfred North Whitehead and David Ray Griffin.|$|E
