30|$|One {{issue this}} review has raised is the {{low number of}} RCTs which have been {{conducted}} on 4  % icodextrin solution in gynaecological surgery, despite its widespread use. Another issue was the different ways the authors reported the effect of 4  % icodextrin solution on adhesions. Out of the eight different measurements of adhesions at SLL which were analysed, none were reported by all three studies. Although the three studies used the mAFS adhesion score, often different aspects were reported. For example, {{it was not possible}} to analyse the incidence of adhesions at SLL as Brown et al. stated the reduction in the number of sites of adhesions at SLL but did not provide the number of adhesion sites at baseline, whereas DiZerega et al. reported the incidence of adhesions in patients with at least one adhesion at baseline, and Trew et al. reported only the incidence of de novo adhesions. There was also no long-term follow-up with contact terminating <b>after</b> <b>SLL</b> and the longest time between the initial laparoscopy and the SLL being 16  weeks. It would be interesting to see if there was any difference in the safety/adverse events such as bowel obstruction with further follow up.|$|E

The {{goal of the}} study was to analyse the results of 85 cases of second-look laparotomy (SLL) and explore the influence of this procedure on survival. Patients and Methods. We reviewed retrospectively 85 cases of SLL collected and treated in our institute between 1994 and 2003. Results. Complete pathologic response (CPR) was 25. 8 %, microscopic disease (Rmicro) was 38. 8 %, and macroscopic disease (Rmacro) was 35. 4 %. In patients with negative SLL results, disease recurrence was diagnosed in 41 %. The 3 - and 5 -year overall survival rates for the entire population were 91 % and 87 %, respectively. The 3 - and 5 -year disease-free survivals were, respectively, 76. 3 % and 58. 5 % in negative SLL versus 55. 7 % and 16 % in positive SLL. The difference between the group of patients with complete response (76 %) and the patients with residual microscopic disease (72 %) was not significant. The tumoral residuum after initial surgery was the only prognostic factor influencing significantly the disease-free survival. On Cox regression model analysis, only initial tumoral residuum (P = 0. 04) and tumoral residuum <b>after</b> <b>SLL</b> (P = 0. 02) were independent prognostic factors for survival. Conclusions. The most important advantage of SLL is the early detection of recurrence and thus the early administration of consolidation treatment resulting in a better prognosis. 1...|$|E
30|$|Material and Methods: A {{total of}} 108 {{patients}} who underwent <b>SLL</b> <b>after</b> LM were retrospectively analyzed. Absorbable cellulose adhesion preventions {{were used for}} uterine repair at LM in all women. The influence of the uterine status immediately after uterine repair at LM (number, length and location of wounds, as well as wound appearance classified as virtually normal, swollen or protruding) on adhesion formation were evaluated.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. This study evaluates both scopes of 4 DryField PH, {{certified}} for adhesion {{prevention and}} hemostasis, in patients undergoing surgery for various and severe gynecological disorders. Methods. This is a two-institutional study. Adhesion prevention efficacy was evaluated using video documentation of first-look laparoscopies (FLL) and second-look laparoscopies (SLL); other patient {{data were analyzed}} retrospectively. Twenty patients with various disorders were evaluated, 4 assigned to a uterus pathology, 10 to endometriosis, and 6 to an adhesion disease group. Nine patients received 4 DryField primarily for hemostasis and 11 solely for adhesion prevention. Nineteen patients had <b>SLL</b> <b>after</b> 5 to 12 weeks and one after 13 months. Results. At FLL with 4 DryField, immediate hemostasis could be achieved in diffuse bleeding. At SLL, effective adhesion prevention was observed in 18 of all 20 women, with only 2 revealing major adhesions. In particular, only 1 of the 6 women with adhesion disease as predominant disorder showed major adhesions at SLL. Conclusions. Modified polysaccharide 4 DryField is not only effective in diffuse bleeding. In this cohort with extensive surgery for various gynecological pathologies, 4 DryField showed effective adhesion prevention as confirmed at SLL, too. Its use as premixed gel is a convenient variant for treatment of large peritoneal wounds...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: This was a multinational, open-label, {{randomized}} phase III trial comparing yttrium- 90 -labeled murine HMFG 1 (90 Y-muHMFG 1) plus standard treatment versus standard treatment {{alone in}} patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) who had attained a complete clinical remission after cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 844 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage Ic to IV patients were initially screened, of whom 447 patients with a negative second-look laparoscopy (SLL) {{were randomly assigned to}} receive either a single dose of 90 Y-muHMFG 1 plus standard treatment (224 patients) or standard treatment alone (223 patients). Patients in the active treatment arm received a single intraperitoneal dose of 25 mg of 90 Y-muHMFG 1 (target dose 666 MBq/m 2). The primary end point was length of survival; secondary end points included time to relapse and safety. The study had an 80 % power to detect a 15 % change in survival. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 3. 5 years (range, 1 to 6 years), 70 patients had died in the active treatment arm compared with 61 patients in the control arm. Cox proportional hazards analysis of survival demonstrated no difference between treatment arms. In the study drug arm, 104 patients experienced relapse compared with 98 patients in the standard treatment arm. No difference in time to relapse was observed between the two study arms. Active therapy was associated with occasional grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia and grade 1 or 2 GI symptoms, abdominal discomfort, arthralgia, and myalgia. CONCLUSION A single IP administration of 90 Y-muHMFG 1 to patients with EOC who had a negative <b>SLL</b> <b>after</b> primary therapy did not extend survival or time to relapse...|$|R
