5|$|England {{is highly}} industrialised, {{but since the}} 1970s {{there has been a}} decline in {{traditional}} heavy and manufacturing industries, and an increasing emphasis on a more service industry oriented economy. Tourism has become a significant industry, attracting millions of visitors to England each year. The export part of the economy is dominated by pharmaceuticals, cars (although many English marques are now foreign-owned, such <b>as</b> <b>Land</b> Rover, Lotus, Jaguar and Bentley), crude oil and petroleum from the English parts of North Sea oil along with Wytch Farm, aircraft engines and alcoholic beverages.|$|E
5|$|From 1950, Braathens SAFE started flying charter {{services}} to Europe with Douglas DC-6, mainly to Copenhagen and Paris. DNL protested because Braathens SAFE was charging too low ticket prices, while DDL protested against the flights to Copenhagen. In September 1951, Braathens SAFE offered Danish authorities to fly all domestic routes without subsidies, {{but this was}} rejected because such a permit could only be issued to Danish airlines. After World War II, only Fornebu, Stavanger Airport, Sola and Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik were in use <b>as</b> <b>land</b> airport. A plan for construction was passed by parliament in 1952, that based the financing of airports as joint civilian and military airports, with funding from NATO.|$|E

5|$|The predilection of the Welsh for roasted cheese led to {{the dish}} of Welsh rarebit, or Welsh rabbit, {{seasoned}} melted cheese poured over toasted bread. The cheese {{would need to be}} a harder one, such as chedder or similar. Referred to as Welsh rabbit as early as 1725, the name is not similar to the Welsh term caws pobi. Welsh folk rarely ate rabbit due to the cost and <b>as</b> <b>land</b> owners would not allow rabbit hunting, so the term is more likely a slur on the Welsh. The name evolved from rabbit to rarebit, possibly to remove the slur from Welsh cuisine or due to simple reinterpretation of the word to make menus more pleasant.|$|E

He denounced the unjust exploitation by the Mafia, and when Li Causi started {{to talk about how}} the peasants were being deceived by ‘a powerful leaseholder’ – a thinly disguised reference to Vizzini – the Mafia boss hurled: It’s a lie. Pandemonium broke out. The rally ended in a shoot-out which left 14 people wounded including Li Causi and Pantaleone. Six months later Vizzini acquired the lease for the Miccichè estate.|$|E

5|$|According to Hindu mythology, {{the lands}} of Kerala were {{recovered}} from the sea by the axe-wielding warrior sage Parasurama, the sixth avatar of Vishnu (hence, Kerala is also called Parasurama Kshetram ("The Land of Parasurama")). Parasurama threw his axe across the sea, and the water receded {{as far as it}} reached. According to legend, this new area of land extended from Gokarna to Kanyakumari. The land which rose from sea was filled with salt and unsuitable for habitation; so Parasurama invoked the Snake King Vasuki, who spat holy poison and converted the soil into fertile lush green land. Out of respect, Vasuki and all snakes were appointed as protectors and guardians of the land. The legend was later expanded, and found literary expression in the 17th or 18th century with Keralolpathi, which traces the origin of aspects of early Kerala society, such <b>as</b> <b>land</b> tenure and administration, to the story of Parasurama. In medieval times Kuttuvan may have emulated the Parasurama tradition by throwing his spear into the sea to symbolise his lordship over it.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture is the {{mainstay}} of the Malagasy economy. Land {{is used for the}} cultivation of rice and other crops, raising of zebu and other livestock, the fabrication of bricks and other traditional livelihoods. In Antananarivo, access to land is guaranteed and protected by law for every resident of the city. The CUA manages requests to lease or purchase land, but demand dramatically outstrips supply and much of the unallocated land fails to meet the requisite criteria for parceling, such <b>as</b> <b>land</b> where floodwater runoff is diverted. Much of this marginal land has been illegally occupied and developed by land-seeking residents, creating shantytown slums in pockets throughout the lower portions of the city. This uncontrolled development poses sanitation and safety risks to residents in these areas.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} earnest on 18 April 2013 after {{completion}} of remedial and preparatory works such <b>as</b> <b>land</b> acquisition, removal of vegetation, demolition of certain structures and remedial works on old mines in Midlothian, for which over £54 million was spent by Network Rail. The first task was the excavation of the track alignment through Monktonhall and the clearing of the site for Shawfair station. Construction of the line's first bridge, Rye Haugh Bridge at Millerhall, were underway on 6 August 2013 as part of works to deviate the line out of Edinburgh from Newcraighall before it returns to the original alignment. The 23-arch Newbattle Viaduct (or Lothianbridge Viaduct) was used by lorries removing spoil from the construction site which eased traffic on local roads.|$|E

5|$|D.C. United and {{the city}} signed a final {{construction}} agreement on June 8. The agreement required that the facility seat a minimum of 17,000 people, and established the term of the lease at 30 years for a minimal $1 per year. The agreement also contained a clause governing land: If the cost of land acquisition rose above $150 million, D.C. United was required to reimburse the city 50 percent of the excess (although the club's commitment was capped at $10 million). The club was also barred from playing more than an occasional home game away from the Buzzard Point stadium, prohibiting the team from relocating during the term of the lease. Mayor Bowser then submitted the agreement, as well <b>as</b> <b>land</b> purchase agreements and a revised developer agreement, to the City Council for approval; the council approved the land purchase agreements on June 30, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Donald Cousens Parkway or York Regional Road48, also {{referred}} to historically as the Markham Bypass or Markham Bypass Extension, is a regionally maintained arterial bypass of Markham in the Canadian province of Ontario. Named for former Markham mayor Don Cousens in April 2007, the route initially travelled northward from Copper Creek Drive in Box Grove, south of Highway407, to Major Mackenzie Drive (York Regional Road25). A southern extension to Steeles Avenue was later completed and the name Donald Cousens Parkway applied along the extension to Ninth Line. In addition to its role of funneling through-traffic around downtown Markham, the route serves as a boundary to residential development <b>as</b> <b>land</b> {{to the north and}} east are part of the protected Rouge Park and southwest limits of the planned Pickering Airport.|$|E
5|$|Like the extinctions {{of other}} New Zealand birds {{such as the}} piopio in the 19th century, {{the decline of the}} huia was poorly studied. Massive {{deforestation}} occurred in the North Island at this time, particularly in the lowlands of southern Hawkes Bay, the Manawatu and the Wairarapa, <b>as</b> <b>land</b> was cleared by European settlers for agriculture. The huia was particularly vulnerable to this as it could only live in old-growth forest where there were abundant rotting trees filled with wood-boring insect larvae. It seems it could not survive in regenerating, secondary forests. Although the mountainous part of its former range was not deforested, the lowland forests of the valleys below were systematically destroyed. The destruction of this part of its habitat would have undoubtedly had a severe impact on huia populations, but its removal would have been particularly dire if they did in fact descend to the lowlands as a winter refuge to escape snow at higher altitudes as some researchers including Oliver have surmised.|$|E

5|$|Members of this {{superfamily}} first {{arose in}} the late Cretaceous. Leidyosuchus of Alberta is the earliest known genus. Fossil alligatoroids have been found throughout Eurasia <b>as</b> <b>land</b> bridges across both the North Atlantic and the Bering Strait have connected North America to Eurasia during the Cretaceous, Paleogene, and Neogene periods. Alligators and caimans split in North America during the late Cretaceous and the latter reached South America by the Paleogene, before {{the closure of the}} Isthmus of Panama during the Neogene period. The Chinese alligator likely descended from a lineage that crossed the Bering land bridge during the Neogene. The modern American alligator is well represented in the fossil record of the Pleistocene. The alligator's full mitochondrial genome was sequenced in the 1990s and it suggests the animal evolved at a rate similar to mammals and greater than birds and most cold-blooded vertebrates. However, the full genome, published in 2014, suggests that the alligator evolved much more slowly than mammals and birds.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the station}} started construction, land {{prices in the}} {{immediate}} area have nearly doubled. Interest in the surrounding area has also grown, as many development {{companies are going to}} Hudson Yards to buy air rights; for instance Related Companies, already the developer of Hudson Yards, entered a contract to buy a $75 million-plus parcel of land between 35th and 36th Streets and between Eleventh Avenue and Hudson Boulevard, as well <b>as</b> <b>land</b> over a McDonald's to build 50 Hudson Yards. Also {{as a result of the}} subway extension, three tenants have already been found for 10 Hudson Yards, and Citigroup is considering moving to the area. Most importantly, however, the $750 million platform supporting much of Hudson Yards was built starting in January 2013; subway construction for a station that could potentially carry up to 27,000 daily passengers necessitated the construction of more buildings, as 70% of tenants are expected to come to Hudson Yards via the 7 subway extension. Additionally, new restaurants, luxury condominiums, and stores have appeared near the station and along the extension's route, and residential prices along the extension have also increased. A construction boom has occurred in the greater Hudson Yards area as well.|$|E
5|$|The Uttar Pradesh Financial Corporation (UPFC) was {{established}} in the year 1954 under the SFCs Act of 1951 mainly to develop small- and medium-scale industries in the state.
