40|$|In {{recognition}} of the risky nature of most business, courts are reluctant to intrude into the boardroom and second-guess directors’ decisions. Providing the directors have performed their duties without personal interests being served, have informed themselves, and have acted in what they believe are the company’s best interests, the courts will not interfere, unless the decisions are really very foolish. Only then will honest directors have to face <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> <b>negligence.</b> Certainly, they can make bad decisions and not be pursued. This notion or principle, which shields directors from {{all but the most}} egregious carelessness, is called the business judgment principle.

5000|$|Trespass vi et armis was a {{precursor}} to many other forms of lawsuits at common law. The cause came to be formulaic {{and in many cases}} fictitious. For instance, a lawsuit against a defendant had spoiled wine with salt water required an allegation that he had done so with bows and arrows. [...] The ancient courts at common law developed trespass upon the case as an alternative pleading to causes of action which arose neither from force nor weapons. In modern times, the specific formalities of the distinction between the two have dropped in favor of notice pleading or code pleading and <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> <b>negligence,</b> battery, trespass to chattels, and conversion. [...] The related phrase of contra pacem regis, [...] "against the King's peace", was necessarily not a required element of trespass vi et armis although it was possible for both allegations to appear in a lawsuit when the intentional use of force or weapons breached the peace.|$|R

50|$|Millett J {{held that}} the {{administrator}} had not unfairly prejudiced the creditors, and rejected that the standard of care had been breached. This was, in substance, an <b>action</b> <b>for</b> professional <b>negligence.</b> The administrator owed a duty to a company to obtain a proper price for assets, {{the same as for}} anybody with a power to sell property that does not belong to him (such as a mortgagee, as in Cuckmere Brick Co Ltd v Mutual Finance Ltd 1971 Ch 949). He ‘must take reasonable care in choosing the time at which to sell the property. His duty is ‘to take reasonable care to obtain the best price that the circumstances permit, as in Standard Chartered Bank Ltd v Walker 1982 1 WLR 1410. But that only meant ‘the best prices that circumstances as he reasonably perceives them to be permit. He is not made liable because his perception is wrong, unless it is unreasonable.’ Professional negligence principles did apply to professional insolvency practitioners, which administrators must be. This was to be judged by the standard of ‘an ordinary, skilled practitioner. In order to succeed the claimant must establish that the administrator has made an error which a reasonably skilled and careful insolvency practitioner would not have made.’ Millett J also said the following.|$|R

50|$|In the 19th century, an <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>negligence</b> {{was only}} {{available}} {{if there was}} a particular relationship between the injured person and the person said to be negligent. The most common founding of the relationship was that of contract, but only where both people were party to the same contract, referred to as privity of contract. Thus in Winterbottom v Wright, Winterbottom had a contract with the Postmaster-General to drive a mail coach, while Wright had a contract with the Postmaster-General to maintain the mail coach. Wright performed his contract negligently and a wheel fell of the coach and Winterbottom was injured. The Court of Exchequer held that because Winterbottom and Wright were not parties to the same contract, such that Wright had no liability in negligence. There was no privity of contract where goods were sold by an intermediary, or where the goods were bought on behalf of another. There were some exceptions, such as Langridge v Levy where the seller fraudulently misrepresented that the gun was safe, knowing that the gun was bought on behalf of the buyers son, and George v Skivington where a chemist negligently compounded a bottle of hair shampoo, knowing it was to be used by the plaintiff's wife. In 1932 the law of negligence however was radically altered by the House of Lords in the decision of Donoghue v Stevenson, where Lord Atkin held that the particular relationships that had hitherto been held to give rise to a duty of care were but instances of a general rule that a person owed a duty of care who ought reasonably have been contemplated as being closely and directly affected by the actions.|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} whether pressure ulcers formed while {{a patient}} is a resident {{in a nursing home}} can be considered an act of nursing negligence. It considers whether pressure ulcers are preventable and whether nurses can be held accountable for their formation. In the context of increasing legal <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>negligence</b> it recommends detailed record-keeping, using clinical guidelines and keeping up to date with current clinical thinking. An ethical framework is applied which includes a discussion of prima facie obligations. Many older people in nursing homes will be vulnerable to the formation of pressure ulcers. Through careful identification of risk factors and prompt interventions, care planning and evaluation, pressure ulcers can often be prevented. If they are preventable, it is debatable whether healthcare professionals should be held accountable for their formation. This article will discuss the ethical, legal and professional issues that surround pressure ulcer prevention and management.

40|$|Abstract: Viewed in {{the context}} of a {{so-called}} 'compensation crisis' in the United Kingdom, defensive medicine broadly refers to a response by doctors to the risk of being sued in an <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>negligence.</b> However, the interrelated risk discourses of a 'compensation crisis' and defensive medical practice are suffused with controversy and confusion. For example, influenced by the methods of positivism, narrowly constructed 'cause' and 'effect' studies of defensIve medicine have tended to heighten controversy and confusion around the phenomenon. Accordingly, whilst some researchers seem perplexed by the findings of their studies, others appear to have simply abandoned their projects. Thus, in contrast to simplistic 'cause' and 'effect' methods a key aim in this thesis is to adopt a social constructionist, and therefore a reflexive approach to the study of medical practice and discourses of risk. Underpinned by theories of risk and control, the discussion draws upon theoretical concepts that include contestation and therefore 'reflexivity' in knowledge, 'governmentality', trust, autonomy and discretion. In acknowledging in this thesis that risks associated in public discourse with defensive medicine might have some foundation in reality, unlike most studies informed by positivism, neither defensive medicine nor risk are understood as objective realities. Rather, risk is largely considered in relation to representations of the world as being anxious or in crisis of some kind. In sum, thi~/study suggests that 'reflexivity' in professional practice and medical discourses of risk may be viewed within a nexus of social, political, technological and cultural transformation, entailing for example, the organization of trust relations, indeterminacy, and the erosion of control. The thesis is structured around seven chapters. The initial chapters ground the later analysis of data generated via semi-structured interviews with hospital doctors in England and Wales.
