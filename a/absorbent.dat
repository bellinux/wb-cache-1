30|$|Hydrophobicity {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} properties of oil <b>absorbents.</b> Highly hydrophobic <b>absorbents</b> (Feng et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2015 b) exhibit a better efficiency for oil absorption than low-hydrophobic <b>absorbents.</b> The cost of the <b>absorbents</b> might be low due to the large amounts required for cleaning oil spills. Besides, the development of <b>absorbents</b> capable of being recycled would be an interesting achievement in oil spills treatment. <b>Absorbents</b> with highly porous structures and superhydrophobicity would be capable of very efficient removal of oil spills. For this purpose, efforts are needed to find eco-friendly materials with superhydrophobicity properties, making them selective for the absorption of oil as well as enhancing their buoyancy, recyclability and price (Korhonen et al. 2011).|$|R

5|$|Uranium-235 was {{the first}} isotope that {{was found to be}} fissile. Other {{naturally}} occurring isotopes are fissionable, but not fissile. On bombardment with slow neutrons, its uranium-235 isotope will most of the time divide into two smaller nuclei, releasing nuclear binding energy and more neutrons. If too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei, a nuclear chain reaction occurs that results in a burst of heat or (in special circumstances) an explosion. In a nuclear reactor, such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a neutron poison, absorbing some of the free neutrons. Such neutron <b>absorbent</b> materials are often part of reactor control rods (see nuclear reactor physics for a description of this process of reactor control).|$|E

This list includes more recent pieces of armour, developed as result of a trend toward (lamellar) scale armour that began in Japan in the 6th to the 7th centuries and matured in the mid-Heian period (9th to 10th centuries). Combining materials such as leather and silk with iron or steel parts, these armours had the advantage of being light, flexible, foldable and shock <b>absorbent.</b> They were generally lacquered to protect them from the humid climate and were used widely from the late Heian period to the mid-14th century.

5|$|For the {{construction}} of the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA, with the engineering firm Arup, worked to reduce the noise levels in stations. In order to reduce noise for all future stations starting with the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA is investing in low-vibration track using ties encased in concrete-covered rubber and neoprene pads. Continuously welded rail, which is also being installed, reduces the noise being made by the wheels of trains. The biggest change {{that is going to be}} made is in the design of stations. Current stations were built with tile and stone, which bounce sound everywhere, while newer stations will have the ceilings lined with <b>absorbent</b> fiberglass or mineral wool that will direct sound toward the train and not the platform. With less noise from the trains, platform announcements could be heard more clearly. They will be clearer with speakers spaced periodically on the platform, angled so that announcements can be heard by the riders.

5|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the stealth characteristics is difficult to gauge. The RCS value is a restrictive measurement of the aircraft's frontal or side area {{from the perspective of}} a static radar. When an aircraft maneuvers it exposes a completely different set of angles and surface area, potentially increasing radar observability. Furthermore, the F-22's stealth contouring and radar <b>absorbent</b> materials are chiefly effective against high-frequency radars, usually found on other aircraft. The effects of Rayleigh scattering and resonance mean that low-frequency radars such as weather radars and early-warning radars are more likely to detect the F-22 due to its physical size. However, such radars are also conspicuous, susceptible to clutter, and have low precision. Additionally, while faint or fleeting radar contacts make defenders aware that a stealth aircraft is present, reliably vectoring interception to attack the aircraft is much more challenging. According to the USAF an F-22 surprised an Iranian F-4 Phantom II that was attempting to intercept an American UAV, despite Iran's claim of having military VHF radar coverage over the Persian Gulf.|$|E

This investigation compared the performance of phase-changing <b>absorbents</b> to state-of-the-art monoethanolamine (MEA) capture for three different flue gas conditions with CO 2 concentrations ranging from 4 mole% to 13 mole%. Results indicate that depending on the flue gas conditions, the specific equivalent work necessary for operating phase-changing <b>absorbents</b> is expected to be up to 40 % lower than for MEA capture. However, as the level of maturity of phase-changing <b>absorbents</b> is certainly lower than MEA capture, higher uncertainty in performance is expected.

30|$|Treatment of {{oil spills}} is an {{important}} issue for environmental science and technology. In the last decades, the environmental pollution caused by oil spills on rivers and oceans has been a great concern (Fingas 2012). Several techniques have been developed for oil removal from water; among them are the uses of chemical dispersants and sorbents, bioremediation, skimmers, burning, etc. (Ge et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2015 a; Teisala et al. 2014). Highly efficient <b>absorbents</b> are mainly used in these processes (Ceylan and Dogu 2009; Radetic et al. 2008; Yang et al. 2015 b). High capacity of <b>absorbents</b> for oil absorption is commonly correlated with the porosity of the materials (Adebajo et al. 2003; Rengasamy et al. 2011); for this reason, highly porous materials are regularly used as oil <b>absorbents.</b> Syntheses of materials with specific pore diameters (mesoporous and macroporous) for their use as oil <b>absorbents</b> have been offered (Lei et al. 2013; Li et al. 2013).|$|R
