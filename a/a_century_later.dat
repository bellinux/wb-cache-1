5|$|The Junta {{reversed}} the military disasters of 251–71 {{with a string}} of victories, most notably the defeat at Naissus of a vast Gothic army by Claudius II, which was so crushing that the Goths did not seriously threaten the empire again until <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>later</b> at Adrianople (378).|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>century</b> <b>later</b> he {{was already}} a legendary figure; William of Tyre {{believed}} that it was Peter who had planted the idea for the crusade in Urban's mind (which was taken as fact by historians until the 19th century). It is commonly believed that Peter's followers consisted of a massive group of untrained and illiterate peasants who did not even have any idea where Jerusalem was, but indeed there were many knights among the peasants, including Walter Sans Avoir, who was lieutenant to Peter and led a separate army.|$|E

5|$|A new {{critical}} {{edition of}} both BWV 243 and 243a {{was published in}} 1955 as Series 2, Volume 3 of the New Bach Edition. Although the D major version remained the standard for life performance and studio recordings, half <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>later</b> also the E-flat major version had been published in new editions adapted to performance, it had been recorded several times, and its composition history had been further unravelled.|$|E
5|$|About <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>later,</b> a new mansion was {{constructed}} on land {{that had been}} reclaimed from the Thames, southeast of the first castle.

5|$|According to Constantine VII, the Slavs rose {{up again}} in the early 840s, but were {{defeated}} by strategos Theoktistos Bryennios. In the south, the two tribes of the Ezeritai and Melingoi held out longer. They were eventually subdued and forced to pay heavy tribute, but retained their autonomy. These two tribes rose up again <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>later,</b> in 921. Again they were quickly subdued, this time by the strategos Krenites Arotras, but managed to remain autonomous and retain their distinct identity until well into Frankish times.|$|E

5|$|At {{the heyday}} of Reformation in the Commonwealth, {{at the end of}} the 16th century, there were about one {{thousand}} Protestant congregations, nearly half of them Calvinist. Half <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>later,</b> only 50% of them had survived, with the burgher Lutheranism suffering lesser losses, the szlachta dominated Calvinism and Nontrinitarianism (Polish Brethren) the greatest. The closing of the Brethren Racovian Academy and a printing facility in Raków on charges of blasphemy in 1638 forewarned of more trouble to come.|$|E
5|$|In 1833, Wagner's brother Albert {{managed to}} obtain {{for him a}} {{position}} as choir master at the theatre in Würzburg.

This work, which imitated the style of Weber, went unproduced until half <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>later,</b> when it was premiered in Munich shortly after the composer's death in 1883.|$|E
5|$|Invasion by Magnus Barefoot in {{the late}} 11th century {{resulted}} in {{a brief period of}} direct Norwegian rule over the kingdom, but soon the descendants of Godred Crovan re-asserted a further period of largely independent overlordship. This came to an end with the emergence of Somerled, on whose death in 1164 the kingdom was split in two. Just over <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>later</b> the islands became part of the Kingdom of Scotland, following the 1266 Treaty of Perth.|$|E

5|$|Krikler {{comments}} that Mansfield's conclusions ignored the ruling precedent of his predecessor, Matthew Hale, that {{the killing of}} innocents {{in the name of}} self-preservation was unlawful. This ruling was to prove important <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>later</b> in R v Dudley and Stephens, which also concerned the justifiability of acts of murder at sea. Mansfield also failed to acknowledge another important legal principle—that no insurance claim can be legal if it arose from an illegal act.|$|E
5|$|Rainfall in the {{dry zone}} of Sri Lanka is limited to 50-75inches. Under these conditions, rain fed {{cultivation}} was difficult, forcing early settlers to develop means to store water {{in order to maintain}} a constant supply of water for their cultivations. Small irrigation tanks were constructed at village level, to support the cultivations of that village. The earliest medium-scale irrigation tank is the Basawakkulama reservoir built by King Pandukabhaya. Nuwara wewa and Tissa Wewa reservoirs were constructed <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>later.</b> These reservoirs were enlarged in subsequent years by various rulers.|$|E
5|$|Romblon was {{separated}} from the jurisdiction of Arevalo and annexed to Capiz, when the province was created in 1716.

Asi-speaking natives were assigned the letter F, Romblomanon speakers were assigned the letter M, speakers of the Sibuyanon style of Romblomanon were assigned the letter R, while Onhan-speaking natives were assigned the letter G.|$|E

5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{was first}} observed by English scientists Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton, and its principle – wave interference – explained by Thomas Young <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>later.</b> Young described iridescence {{as the result}} of interference between reflections from two or more surfaces of thin films, combined with refraction as light enters and leaves such films. The geometry then determines that at certain angles, the light reflected from both surfaces interferes constructively, while at other angles, the light interferes destructively. Different colours therefore appear at different angles.|$|E
5|$|The Jacob is a {{traditional}} British breed of domestic sheep. It combines two characteristics unusual in sheep: it is piebald – dark-coloured with areas of white wool – and it is often polycerate or multi-horned. It most commonly has four horns. The origin of the breed is not known; broken-coloured polycerate sheep were present in England {{by the middle of}} the seventeenth century, and were widespread <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>later.</b> A breed society was formed in 1969, and a flock book was published from 1972.|$|E

Almost <b>a</b> <b>century</b> <b>later,</b> in 1686, a second uprising in Tarnovo was headed by Rostislav Stratimirovic, who also claimed to have belonged to the Shishman dynasty and styled himself as Prince of Bulgaria.|$|E
