40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 The {{demand for}} plug-in {{electric}} vehicles has grown rapidly {{in recent years}} due to lower operation costs and lower emissions in comparison to conventional, gas-powered vehicles. Despite these benefits, {{it is essential for}} utilities to investigate the impact of plug-in electric vehicles in order to protect utility system components, especially distribution level networks. Since the operation, plugging timing and energy consumption of these vehicles is subject to uncertainty; we must resort to use probabilistic tools. As a consequence a natural way to investigate the impact of plug-in electric vehicles on distribution networks is by means of Monte Carlo simulations. Since it is of paramount importance to set up scenarios as realistically as possible; therefore in this study, a set of real driving behavior data for 34, 000 drivers is used. The investigation considers two different types of distribution <b>loads</b> - commercial <b>area</b> <b>loads,</b> and residential <b>area</b> <b>loads,</b> as well as different types of charging behaviors such as charge-at-home-only and charge-at-work-and-home...|$|R

Combining {{with the results of}} finite element numerical simulation, we find that the creep property of the tested material is one of the important factors causing the micron indentation hardness descending with the increase of indentation depth. The analysis of experimental results with different indentation depths demonstrates that the hardness decrease can be bated if the continuous stiffness measurement technique is not adopted; this indicates that the test method itself may also be one of the factors causing the hardness being descended...|$|E

50|$|In geology, a forebulge is a {{flexural}} {{bulge in}} front of a load on the lithosphere. The load causes the lithosphere to flex by depressing the plate beneath it. Because of the flexural rigidity of the lithosphere, the <b>area</b> around the <b>load</b> is uplifted by a height that is 4% of that of the depression under the load. The load and the resulting flexure place stress on the mantle, causing it to flow into the <b>area</b> around the <b>loaded</b> <b>area.</b> The subsidence of the <b>area</b> under the <b>load</b> and the uplift of the forebulge continue until the load is in isostatic equilibrium, a process that takes on the order of 10,000 to 20,000 years. Because of the coupling with the mantle, the rate of forebulge formation and collapse is controlled by mantle viscosity.|$|R
