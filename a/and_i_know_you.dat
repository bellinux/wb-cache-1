500|$|In the Giants' match-up {{with the}} St. Louis Cardinals in the 2002 NLCS, Lofton {{delivered}} a key hit {{to help the}} Giants win their first pennant since 1989. In the ninth inning, Cardinals manager Tony La Russa summoned left-handed reliever Steve Kline to face Lofton, who had already notched two singles in the game. Giants manager Dusty Baker considered bringing a right-handed hitter to pinch-hit for Lofton, but decided against doing so {{on the advice of}} his 3-year-old son. Lofton would hit a first-pitch single to the outfield, scoring David Bell from second base and creating a 21 Giants victory. After the game, Baker remarked, [...] "I just knew Kenny was focused <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> can't keep Kenny down for too long. That's why we got Kenny over here. He's a big-game player and he's been great in the playoffs." [...] The Giants would hold a five-run lead in the seventh inning of Game Six of the World Series against the Anaheim Angels, but eight outs away from winning the World Series, the Angels rallied to win 65. The Angels took Game Seven the following night, and {{for the second time in}} his career, Lofton had lost a World Series.|$|E

When {{he took her}} to Newport for a respite, 11-year-old Benny wrote to her: [...] "I hope he won't be elected for I should not like to be at Washington <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> would not either." [...] But the President-elect convinced his wife that his office would be an asset for Benny's success in life.|$|E
2500|$|CBS and Warner Bros. {{terminated}} Sheen's {{contract on}} March 7, 2011. He {{was replaced by}} Ashton Kutcher. In the aftermath of his dismissal, Sheen remained vocally critical of Chuck Lorre, and filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against Lorre and Warner Bros., which was settled the following September 26. That same month, Sheen, while presenting an award at the Primetime Emmy Awards, addressed [...] "everybody here from Two and a Half Men" [...] and stated, [...] "From {{the bottom of my}} heart, I wish you nothing but the best for this upcoming season. We spent eight wonderful years together <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> will continue to make great television." [...] In 2012, Sheen returned to television in Anger Management, the spin-off of the movie of the same name.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now that's right, York--but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> {{would do}} it.
