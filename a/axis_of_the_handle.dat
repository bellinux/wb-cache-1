A crash axe is sometimes also used by crash rescue firefighter crews to chop through the airplane's sheet metal skin for a rescue opening; modern crash axes are often made with an electrically insulated handle.|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to {{understand}} how to easily perform weight measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> workpiece in <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> <b>handling</b> <b>the</b> robot cycle, provided that <b>the</b> <b>handling</b> cycle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robot is not a sufficient idle time.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>handle</b> is made <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ivory <b>of</b> an {{elephant}} tusk, {{and not from}} a hippopotamus canine tooth as was first thought. <b>The</b> <b>handle</b> was carved along <b>the</b> <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tusk, as evidenced by a dark spot located above <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Master <b>of</b> Animals", which is <b>the</b> tip <b>of</b> pulp cavity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tusk.

40|$|To prevent {{low back}} {{disorders}} due to lifting activities, occupational lifting tasks are {{being replaced by}} pushing/pulling tasks, for instance in refuse collection. Design factors of two-wheeled carts, such as centre of mass (COM) and handle location, might {{have a major impact}} on joint loading. We varied the (horizontal and vertical) COM and handle location of a two-wheeled container to test their effect on handle forces and joint loading during two-handed steady pushing and pulling. Net torques at the low back, shoulder and elbow were relatively low in the standard container design. Backward displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> COM increased low back loading and forward displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> COM increased shoulder and elbow loading. A COM displacement in <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wheels did not have negative effects on joint loading and reduced the forces, needed to tilt the container. A 0. 1 m increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>handle</b> height slightly reduced the required vertical force without adverse effects on joint loading.
