25|$|The {{students}} {{spend a lot}} of time at IUT Library and Documentation Centre. It is on the first floor of the Library/Cafeteria building overlooking a lake on the eastern and western sides. The library has a floor area of 1300 sq. meters with a shelf space of 52,000 books. It is divided into two sections, General and Research/Reference. To conduct the IUT Library service, a customised software was developed and installed. The CSE (Computer Science and Engineering) department developed a new software for library management which is accessible through computers <b>and</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phones.</b> The data of projects/thesis/dissertations have been incorporated in the software. Now the faculty members and the students may search their desired books/dissertation from OPAC (On-line Public Access Catalogue). Local Area Network (LAN) in the IUT campus. There are 26,200 books on engineering, technical and vocational subjects. 20 technical journals are being subscribed from abroad annually. It is an open-shelf library. Books are issued to the students and staff for home use. It is open from 8.00am to 10.00pm on all working days and on one weekend 2.00pm. to 10.00pm.|$|E

Although the attackers were encouraged to murder hostages, the attackers were in communication with the news media via cell phones to make demands in return for the release of hostages. This was believed to be done in order to further confuse Indian authorities that they were dealing with primarily a hostage situation.|$|E

[...] The 1966 shooting massacre at the University of Texas was the inspiration for the story's climax, which was only partially filmed at the University of British Columbia because firearms were not allowed on location at the actual university.

500|$|While {{molten rock}} comes {{closer to the}} surface it would most likely cause more fragmentation, {{triggering}} an explosive eruption that could produce an eruption column with an elevation of [...] and may be sustained for 12hours. A well-documented explosive eruption in the Garibaldi Belt with such force is the eruption of Mount Meager 2,350years ago, which deposed ash as far east as Alberta. This would endanger air traffic {{and would have to}} take another route away from the eruptive zone. Every airport buried under pyroclastic fall would be out of service, including those in Vancouver, Victoria, Kamloops, Prince George and Seattle. The tephra would destroy power transmission lines, satellite dishes, computers and other equipment that operates on electricity. Therefore, telephones, radios <b>and</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> would be disconnected. Structures not built for holding heavy material would likely demolish {{under the weight of the}} tephra. Ash from the eruption plume would subside above the vent area to create pyroclastic flows and would travel east and west down the nearby Cheakamus and Squamish river valleys. These would likely have significant impacts on salmon in the associated rivers and would cause considerable melting of glacial ice to produce debris flows that may extend into Daisy Lake and Squamish to cause significant damage. The eruption column would then travel eastward and extract air travel throughout Canada from Alberta to Newfoundland and Labrador.|$|E
