2500|$|The {{completion}} of the screenplay, concerned Sparks that Cyrus {{would not be able}} to successfully execute the role: [...] "The first thing I thought when I finished the screenplay was, wow, I hope she can do this, this is a tough role because I'm bringing you through a whole gamut of emotion and you're just a 16-year-old girl who's done the Disney Channel. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> do this as an actress?", After visiting the set and watching Cyrus film, Sparks' worries abated. To play the New York teen, Cyrus worked with a dialect coach to lose her Southern accent and learned to play classical piano. After she completed filming, Cyrus said that in a case of life imitating art, she had matured and [...] "changed a lot" [...] over the course of her summer in Georgia, similar to the way Ronnie does in the film.

If I were the {{scientist}} merely, I would say, 'Keep on, and I will stand by to observe your struggles.' But I am not, I am something else than scientist. It angers and agonizes me to see you tortured. I cannot endure it and I will not. In order that I may do all that I hope for, you must give yourself wholly into my care." [...] He was speaking now in a low and throbbing voice, oblivious of time and space. [...] "I must be something more than physician or friend. I have been saying 'must' to you, but I am, after all, a very strange autocrat. My power is dependent on you." [...] Then, in answer to her questioning eyes, he hurried on: [...] "I love you, dear girl, and if you find you can trust yourself to me, fully, in this way, then I am sure of victory.

6000|$|The saint {{acted with}} the concubinarians almost {{in the same}} manner as our Saviour dealt with the publicans and harlots. Far from {{treating}} them severely, the deeper they were plunged in that darling vice, the more tenderly he seemed to use them. On all occasions he declared himself their friend; he made them frequent visits, without fear of being upbraided with so infamous a conversation. He invited himself sometimes to eat with them; and then, assuming an air of gaiety, he desired the master to bring down the children to bear him company. When he had a little commended their prettiness, he asked to see their mother, and shewed her the same countenance, as if he had taken her for an honest woman. If she were beautiful or well shaped, he praised her, and said [...] "she looked like a Portuguese:" [...] after which; in private conversation, [...] "you have," [...] said he to her master, [...] "a fair slave, who well deserves to be your wife." [...] But if she were a swarthy, ugly Indian, [...] "Good God!" [...] he cried out, [...] "what a monster do you keep within your doors! and how <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> endure the sight of her?" [...] Such words, spoken in all appearance without design, had commonly their full effect: the keeper married her whom the saint had commended, and turned off the others.|$|E

If there {{be one of}} those qualities in you, I will give up to you all that you ask."[105] Cæcilius was probably even now in alliance with Verres. He himself, when Quæstor, had robbed the people {{in the collection of the}} corn dues, and was unable therefore to include that matter in his accusation. [...] "You can bring no charge against him on this head, lest it be seen that you were a partner with him in the business."[106] He ridicules him as to his personal insufficiency. [...] "What, Cæcilius! as to those practices of the profession without which an action such as this cannot be carried on, do you think that there is nothing in them? Need there be no skill in the business, no habit of speaking, no familiarity with the Forum, with the judgment-seats, and the laws?"[107] [...] "I know well how difficult the ground is. Let me advise you to look into yourself, and to see whether you are able to do that kind of thing. Have you got voice for it, prudence, memory, wit? <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> expose the life of Verres, as it must be done, to divide it into parts and make everything clear?

'Have I these gifts,' you will ask. Would that I had! But from my childhood I have done all that I could to attain them."[108] ...|$|E

Your greatness, How <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> sense that." [...] In saying this he fell on the feet of Sivan and Thirumal {{and asked them to}} excuse the misdeed.

[...] Orloff responded, [...] "Ultimately, Shakespeare himself was our guide. The Shakespeare histories are not really histories. They're dramas. He compresses time.
