2500|$|In 2005, the United States Congressional Budget Office (CBO) {{released}} a paper called [...] "Analyzing the Economic and Budgetary Effects of a 10 Percent Cut in Income Tax Rates'. This paper considered {{the impact of}} a stylized reduction of 10% in the then existing marginal rate of federal income tax in the US (for example, if those facing a 25% marginal federal income tax rate had it lowered to 22.5%). Unlike earlier research, the CBO paper estimates the budgetary impact of possible macroeconomic effects of tax policies, that is, it attempts to account for how reductions in individual income tax rates might affect the overall future growth of the economy, and therefore influence future government tax revenues; and ultimately, impact deficits or surpluses. In the paper's most generous estimated growth scenario, only 28% of the projected lost revenue from the lower tax rate would be recouped over a 10-year period after a 10% <b>across-the-board</b> <b>reduction</b> in all individual income tax rates. In other words, deficits would increase by nearly the same amount as the tax cut in the first five years, with limited feedback revenue thereafter. Through increased budget deficits, the tax cuts primarily benefiting the wealthy will be paid for—plus interest—by taxes borne relatively evenly by all taxpayers. The paper points out that these projected shortfalls in revenue would have to be made up by federal borrowing: the paper estimates that the federal government would pay an extra US$200 billion in interest over the decade covered by the paper's analysis.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{association}} between cost inefficiency and health outcomes in a national sample of acute-care hospitals in the US over the period 1999 - 2001, with health outcomes being measured by both mortality and complications rates. The empirical analysis examines health outcomes {{as a function of}} cost inefficiency and other determinants of outcomes, using stochastic frontier analysis to obtain hospital cost inefficiency scores. The results showed no systematic pattern of association between cost inefficiency and hospital health outcomes; the basic results were unchanged regardless of whether cost inefficiency was measured with or without using instrumental variables. The analysis also indicated, however, that {{the association between}} cost inefficiency and health outcomes may vary substantially across geographical regions. The study highlights the importance of distinguishing between 'good' costs that reflect the efficient use of resources and 'bad' costs that stem from waste and other forms of inefficiency. In particular, the study's results suggest that hospital programs focused on reducing cost inefficiency are unlikely to be associated with worsened hospital-level mortality or complications rates, while, on the other hand, <b>across-the-board</b> <b>reductions</b> in cost could well have adverse consequences on health outcomes by reducing efficient as well as inefficient costs.

First, we must close a shortfall of $ 3. 3 billion in the current fiscal year, which will grow to $ 14. 5 billion next year without swift and decisive action. And second, we must take steps to avoid a potential shortfall in the state’s cash reserves this July and August, and potentially in March. These problems are {{not the result of}} a fundamental crisis in California’s economy. Indeed, we remain a diverse and dynamic economic powerhouse that will continue to grow and lead the world in innovation. These problems are the result of a budget system where there continues to be no linkage between revenues and spending. If we are to avoid these kinds of fiscal crises in the future, and if we truly want to bring fiscal health to this state for the long term, we must resolve to fundamentally fix the budget system this year – once and for all. In order to close the gap, my budget proposes two actions.

The hospital RPs aim to improve the clinical, financial and managerial performance of public-hospitals, teaching-hospitals and research-hospitals through monitoring trends in individual hospitals' expenditure and tackling improvements in clinical care.

40|$|Because {{the health}} sector makes {{up a large}} share of the U. S. economy, {{widespread}} price changes for medical services can impact overall inflation significantly. Cuts to public health-care spending spill over directly and indirectly to private spending. A recent estimate suggests the full effect of the Medicare payment cuts from the 2011 Budget Control Act resulted in a decline of 0. 24 percentage point in the overall personal consumption expenditures price index. This is over twice the expected drop if private-sector spillovers are not included. The Budget Control Act of 2011 triggered extensive, <b>across-the-board</b> <b>reductions</b> in federal spending from 2013 to 2021. Included in these sequestrations was a one-time 2 % reduction to Medicare payments beginning on April 1, 2013.
