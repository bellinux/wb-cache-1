Observations of the impact and its aftermath would allow astronomers to attempt to determine the <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to improving the}} economy, the lower social classes also had to {{be integrated into the}} new body politic, although they often got few rewards from independence. The political debate seeking <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> was marked by a clash—at times on the battlefield—between liberalism and conservatism. Conservatives sought to maintain the traditional social structures in order to ensure stability; liberals sought to create a more dynamic society and economy by ending ethnically-based social distinctions and freeing property from economic restrictions. In its quest to transform society, liberals often adopted policies that were not welcome by Native communities, who had benefited from unique protections afforded to them by traditional Spanish law.|$|E

25|$|The {{succession}} to Muhammad {{raises questions}} about the leadership of Islam after his death: Muhammad's successor, how they should be elected, conditions of legitimacy and the role of successor. <b>Answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> have led to several divisions in the Muslim community since the first century of Muslim history, giving rise to the Sunni, Shia and Khawarij schools. After Muhammad's death in AD 632, disagreement broke out over who should succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. Since none of his sons survived into adulthood, hereditary succession was not an option. Umar (Umar ibn al-Khattab), a prominent companion of Muhammad, nominated Abu Bakr. Others added their support, and Abu Bakr was made the first caliph. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who believed that Ali (Ali ibn Abi Talib), the Prophet's cousin and son-in-law, had already been designated as his successor by the Prophet. During the First and Second Fitnas the Islamic community divided into a number of groups, each of which had a specific idea about successorship. After the Rashidun caliphate evolved into monarchies and sultanates, Sunnis held power in most areas; Shias emerged in opposition.|$|E
25|$|Religion is {{generally}} {{defined as a}} belief system concerning the supernatural, sacred or divine, and practices, values, institutions and rituals associated with such belief. Some religions also have a moral code. The evolution {{and the history of}} the first religions have recently become areas of active scientific investigation. However, in the course of its development, religion has taken on many forms that vary by culture and individual perspective. Some of the chief questions and issues religions are concerned with include life after death (commonly involving belief in an afterlife), the origin of life, the nature of the universe (religious cosmology) and its ultimate fate (eschatology), and what is moral or immoral. A common source for <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> are beliefs in transcendent divine beings such as deities or a singular God, although not all religions are theistic. Spirituality, belief or involvement in matters of the soul or spirit, {{is one of the many}} different approaches humans take in trying to answer fundamental questions about humankind's place in the universe, the meaning of life, and the ideal way to live one's life. Though these topics have also been addressed by philosophy, and to some extent by science, spirituality is unique in that it focuses on mystical or supernatural concepts such as karma and God.|$|E

2500|$|For Tillich, {{the existential}} {{questions}} {{of human existence}} {{are associated with the}} field of philosophy and, more specifically, ontology (the study of being). This is because, according to Tillich, a lifelong pursuit of philosophy reveals that the central question of every philosophical inquiry always comes back to the question of being, or what it means to be, to exist, to be a finite human being. [...] To be correlated with these questions are the theological answers, themselves derived from Christian revelation. [...] The task of the philosopher primarily involves developing the questions, whereas the task of the theologian primarily involves developing the <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions.</b> [...] However, it should be remembered that the two tasks overlap and include one another: the theologian must be somewhat of a philosopher and vice versa, for Tillich’s notion of faith as “ultimate concern” necessitates that the theological answer be correlated with, compatible with, and in response to the general ontological question which must be developed independently from the answers. [...] Thus, {{on one side of the}} correlation lies an ontological analysis of the human situation, whereas on the other is a presentation of the Christian message as a response to this existential dilemma. For Tillich, no formulation of the question can contradict the theological answer. [...] This is because the Christian message claims, a priori, that the logos “who became flesh” is also the universal logos of the Greeks.|$|E
2500|$|Rating {{the film}} 4/5 stars, Eye for Film commented that [...] "Of all the {{films in the}} Texas Chainsaw series, this is {{probably}} the least gory, a fact that will no doubt disappoint some fans. It certainly has its moments and those disturbed by gore should still approach it with caution, but it's nothing like as gratuitous as much of what has gone before. Events happen to serve the story more than the theme. Horror is found in different places." [...] Staci Wilson of Dread Central wrote that [...] "Not to say I loved Leatherface - It’s far too disgusting for my taste (I'm okay with gore, but there's some gooey necrophilia in this flick that I felt was just thrown in for the ick of it), and there are too many plot holes. Still, it's a very well made film, the cinematography is gorgeous, and the acting is aces across the board", giving a final verdict of 3/5 stars. Anton Bitel of SciFiNow appraised, [...] "In spite, or perhaps because, of all the splatter and excess, this still does not come close to the elusively non-explicit horrors of the original The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, even as it serves as their grim rites of passage. If 'Nobody messes with our family' is the ultimate message, then Maury and Bustillo certainly maintain a respectful continuity to reunite the old clan, as Jed pieces together his future identity from the different influences around him." [...] For being what he called [...] "the most entertaining and pleasing TCM film since 1974's classic", ComingSoon.Net writer Jerry Smith gave the prequel a positive review. He assessed that [...] "Do we really need yet another horror icon origin story and if so, would the explanation be anything we haven't seen before? The <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> are quite refreshing", contrasting the origin story given to that of [...] as having been able to [...] "acknowledge what came before it without ever seeming like a wink-wink to the previous films in the series".
