40|$|Recently {{there has}} been a {{significant}} amount of publicity about high levels of radiation from power lines using Broadband communications over Power Lines (BPL). Specific interference problems, or experimental measurements are typically cited. For smart grid, smart metering and advanced metering infrastructure applications, low data rate Power Line Communications (PLC) will be required. This paper describes a Matlab® program for calculating the radiation and resistive losses for power lines from BPL and PLC signals.

50|$|Aerial bundled cables (also <b>aerial</b> bundled <b>conductors</b> {{or simply}} ABC) are {{overhead}} power lines using several insulated phase conductors bundled tightly together, usually with a bare neutral conductor. This contrasts with the traditional practice of using uninsulated conductors separated by air gaps. This variation of {{overhead power lines}} utilizes the same principles as bundled conductors, except that they are closer together {{to the point of}} touching but each conductor is surrounded by an insulating layer (except for the neutral line).|$|R
40|$|As Eskom {{continues}} its drive for Electricity-for-All and the electrification of rural areas, there is continuing pressure {{to reduce costs}} {{by the use of}} appropriate technologies and designs. Single Wire Earth Return (SWER) and dual phase LV technologies have been introduced for rural areas supply. Savings have also been made by the selection of appropriate design loads on which to base the network design. In addition to load and household density, overall cost per connection is also affected by the extent of voltage regulation allowed for in feeder design and operation. Rural electrification projects are typically supplied by 11 kV or 22 kV 3 wire overhead distribution systems. The LV (230 V single phase or 400 V three phase) supplies are distributed to individual homes using <b>Aerial</b> Bundle <b>Conductor</b> (ABC) and Airdac service connections. The design of the distribution infrastructure is based on the requirement that the voltages at all LV customer installations stay within ± 10 % of the nominal voltage, in accordance with the regulations of the National Electricity Regulator and NRS 048. The maximum allowable voltage drop in the LV feeders is effectively dictated by the local MV supply voltage and level of boosting that is being performed by the local distribution MV/LV supply transformer, which is equipped with an Off Circuit Tap Switch (OCTS). By providing a “stiff ” MV supply voltage (the incoming MV voltage does not deviate significantly from nominal), the allowable voltage drop in the LV runs can be increased, an...|$|R
40|$|Many {{electricity}} suppliers will be installing {{smart meters}} {{during the next}} few years. It is likely that these smart meters will communicate with the electricity suppliers' control centre using power line carrier(PLC) communications. The CENELEC A frequency band from 9 kHz to 95 kHz is set aside for PLC use by Power Supply Companies. It is also possible for power companies to provide internet access using Broadband over Power Lines (BPL). Such systems can operate at frequencies up to 100 MHz. Several trials of BPL have been carried out in Australia. Recently the Amateur Radio fraternity has been raising a significant concern about high levels of radiation from power lines using PLC or BPL. The two dominant high frequency loss mechanisms in transmission lines are resistive losses and radiation. The radiation models in antenna textbooks do not apply to very long lines like power lines. This paper describes the development, from first principles, of a transmission line model that accurately determines both the resistive losses and radiation losses from any transmission line. This model is then applied to Single Wire Earth Return (SWER) lines, three phase overhead lines using typical conductors mounted on crossarms and <b>aerial</b> bundled <b>conductors.</b> These results show that depending on the cable and signal frequency, BPL and PLC can be achieved without causing any interference. This research is sponsored by ERGON, an Australian Electricity supplier operating in rural Queensland, as part of a project to develop a communication system for SWER lines, so that smart metering, fault detection and enhanced network control can be applied to SWER lines. The results presented in this paper show that for CENELEC-A frequencies, all the losses are small for the power lines considered, making a Smart Grid system using PLC feasible...|$|R
40|$|As {{residential}} customers {{become more}} energy conscious and environmentally aware, {{the installation of}} grid connected photovoltaic solar panels for small-scale electricity generation is expected to increase. However, the issue of quality of the electrical supply is as equally important as adopting sustainable energy. This thesis proposes a method to determine the quality of electrical supply based on the acceptable level of harmonic current that can be injected from a typical grid connected residential type photovoltaic inverter system (PVIS). The acceptable number of PVISs is based on not exceeding the recommended harmonic voltage levels in medium voltage (MV- 11 kV) and low voltage (LV- 415 V) distribution systems given in standard AS/NZS 61000. 3. 6 - 2001 and its application guide HB 264 - 2003. To undertake this study, an acceptable frequency domain model of a typical power system is developed, an appropriate model of a typical inverter spectrum is proposed and a method for allocating harmonic voltage distortion levels for PVIS in MV and LV systems by incorporating background distortion is suggested. The harmonic voltage distortion levels caused by the residential type PVIS are calculated based on conventional methods such as nodal analysis applied over the distribution network. A typical residential power system is adapted from the available literature. The LV distributors of the power system were modelled based on residential load and PVIS aggregation, and MV feeders are modelled based on distribution transformer aggregation. The distributors selected for LV systems study are based on overhead open-wire <b>conductor,</b> <b>aerial</b> bundled <b>conductor</b> and underground cabling types and the MV system feeders are based on an open-wire overhead conductor system. Residential load for harmonic studies is modelled based on the duration of equipment usage (with typical household ratings) during the power generation (active time) of the PVIS. Active time of the PVIS is estimated from field measurement data. Since the LV system is of multiple earth neutral (MEN) construction, an additional system study is required to investigate the effective neutral harmonic impedance. This study revealed {{the significance of the}} zero sequence impedance of the system to show the importance of representing the neutral current within the study. Consequently, the acceptable number of PVIS units is limited by triplen harmonic voltage magnitudes suggested by recommended harmonic voltage levels. Studying the available literature revealed that the development of a harmonic current spectrum to represent a typical photovoltaic inverter 2 ̆ 7 s line current is required. Hence, an adequate harmonic current spectrum was developed being selected from three distinct methods. The PVIS spectrums were modelled up to 40 th harmonic, and an appropriate model was selected from among the three proposed models based on their compliance to recommended harmonic current emission levels, both individual and total, as suggested by standards. Examining the harmonic range up to 40 th revealed that recent LV distribution network harmonic studies associated with PVIS are not wide enough in harmonic range to show some important network wide harmonic issues. Allocation of harmonic voltage distortion levels for the LV PVIS was based on the background distortion level and recommended harmonic voltage planning levels and the suggestion in standards to incorporate sufficient diversity for the MV and LV distribution systems contribution. Background harmonic voltage distortion levels were calculated based on published data related to field measurements from dedicated residential feeders in distribution systems. This study has proposed and identified a method to assess the harmonic distortion levels in MV and LV distribution systems, and related key issues, to assist the harmonic management of these systems due to grid connected PVIS...|$|R
40|$|Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) {{is engaged}} in generation, {{transmission}} and {{distribution of electrical energy}} in Sri Lanka with support from Lanka Electricity Company Ltd (LECO) for distribution in certain areas and generation support from a number of private power plants. CEB is incurring huge commercial losses annually supplying electricity to 94 % of households at a unit price lower than the actual unit cost. Minimizing losses in generation, transmission and distribution is of vital importance to any utility. Out of these losses, the distribution loss happens to be the larger component. Distribution system loss can be subdivided as Technical Loss (TL) and Non Technical Loss (NTL). The investment requirement for reducing TL is higher compared to the investment required of reducing NTL in distribution networks. This has drawn special attention for the NTL reduction programs in CEB. For devising and implementing suitable preventative and corrective actions of reducing NTL, it needs to be identified accurately. But identifying NTL is more difficult because no properly recorded information is available in many divisions in the CEB. The aim of this research is to study NTL in the distribution network to find mitigation measures through new technology and new systems. Causes of NTL are identified and quantified to the best possible accuracy and their impacts on NTL are discussed. Further, benefits of applying new technologies such as <b>Aerial</b> Bundled <b>Conductors</b> (ABC) and smart meters for mitigating NTL with cost benefit analysis is also included in this study. Legal framework of Sri Lanka was examined towards implementation the NTL reduction measures and some suggestions are made for future amendments to the Sri Lanka Electricity Act of 2009. In summary, out of the 11. 24 % system losses in 2012, 0. 64 % is generation loss, 2. 02 % is transmission loss and 8. 59 % is identified as distribution loss. This study indicates that on average the 10. 06 % of distribution loss of energy input to Distribution Division 4 in 2012 contains 3. 92 % of NTL component; further details of the composition of the NTL are discussed in this thesis...|$|R
