Shen is famous for discovering the concept of true north and magnetic declination towards the North Pole by calculating a more accurate measurement of the <b>astronomical</b> <b>meridian,</b> and fixed the calculated position of the pole star that had shifted over the centuries. This allowed sailors to navigate the seas more accurately with the magnetic needle compass, also first described by Shen. [...] Shen was made famous for his written description of Bi Sheng, the inventor of movable type printing. Shen was also interested in geology, as he formulated a theory of geomorphology and climate change over time after making observations of strange natural phenomena. Using contemporary knowledge of solar eclipses and lunar eclipses, he theorized that the sun and moon were spherical in shape, not flat, while expanding upon the reasoning of earlier Chinese astronomical theorists. Along with his colleague Wei Pu in the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen used cosmological hypotheses when describing the variations of planetary motion, including retrogradation. One of Shen's greatest achievements, aided by Wei Pu, was correcting the lunar error by diligently recording and plotting the moon's orbital path three times a night {{over a period of}} five years. Unfortunately Shen had many political rivals at court who were determined to sabotage his work. The court fully accepted their corrections to lunar and solar error, but only partially adopted Shen and Wei's corrected plotting of the planetary orbital paths and various speeds.|$|E

5000|$|In astronomy, the {{meridian}} is {{the great}} circle passing through the celestial poles, the zenith, and the nadir of an observer's location. Consequently, it contains also the horizon's north and south points, and it is perpendicular to the celestial equator and horizon. A celestial meridian is coplanar with the analogous terrestrial meridian projected onto the celestial sphere. Hence, the number of <b>astronomical</b> <b>meridians</b> is infinite.|$|R
5|$|Su Song {{also created}} a {{celestial}} atlas (in five separate maps), which had the hour circles between the xiu (lunar mansions) forming the <b>astronomical</b> <b>meridians,</b> with stars marked in an equidistant cylindrical projection {{on each side of}} the equator, and thus, was in accordance to their north polar distances. Furthermore, Su Song must have taken advantage of the astronomical findings of his political rival and contemporary astronomer Shen Kuo. This is so because Su Song's fourth star map places the position of the pole star halfway between Tian shu (−350 degrees) and the current Polaris; this was the more accurate calculation (by 3 degrees) that Shen Kuo had made when he observed the pole star over a period of three months with his width-improved sighting tube. There were many star maps written before Song's book, but the greatest significance of these star maps by Su Song is, that they represent the oldest extant star maps in printed form.|$|R

This phenomenon possesses a considerable uniformity of current strength and voltage. As the Earth currents flow from south to north, electrodes are positioned, beginning in the south and ending in the north, to increase the voltage at as large a distance as possible. In many early implementations, the cost was prohibitive because of an over-reliance on extreme spacing between electrodes.|$|E

The tube aims at a point a 116 degrees of azimut, East-South-East and 17. 3 degrees of altitude, the Sun could be aimed in that direction at 07 : 00 UTC of 12 october and 7 : 25 UT of march 2, but the view is obstructed by the church's building.

Other hypotheses on the <b>meridian</b> <b>astronomical</b> use of this hole are here reviewed. In the case of solar observations it cannot be for meridian transits in Rome, since the lower transits occurs now at 24. 5 degrees at winter solstice; we investigate the case of stellar transits, of declination 30. 8 degrees South. Many alignments are possible leaving the azimut as free parameter, being the columun not in its original collocation, but here we investigate only the meridian transits, and no bright stars could have been seen through that hole, taking also into account the precession 2000 years ago. We conclude that this hole was probably not used for meridian observations. Comment: 8 pages, 5 color figures, in Italian. To appear in Gerbertus vol. 5 (2014...|$|R
50|$|In astronomy, the {{altitude}} in the horizontal coordinate {{system and the}} zenith angle are complementary angles, with the horizon perpendicular to the zenith. The <b>astronomical</b> <b>meridian</b> is also determined by the zenith, and {{is defined as a}} circle on the celestial sphere that passes through the zenith, nadir, and the celestial poles. A zenith telescope is a type of telescope designed to point straight up at or near the zenith, and used for precision measurement of star positions, to simplify telescope construction, or both. The NASA Orbital Debris Observatory and the Large Zenith Telescope are both zenith telescopes since the use of liquid mirrors meant these telescopes could only point straight up.|$|E

5000|$|This old astronomical prime {{meridian}} {{has been replaced}} by a more precise {{prime meridian}}. When Greenwich was an active observatory, geographical coordinates were referred to a local oblate spheroid called a datum known as a geoid, whose surface closely matched local mean sea level. Several datums were in use around the world, all using different spheroids, because mean sea level undulates by as much as 100 metres worldwide. Modern geodetic reference systems, such as the World Geodetic System and the International Terrestrial Reference Frame, use a single oblate spheroid, fixed to the Earth's gravitational centre. The shift from several local spheroids to one worldwide spheroid caused all geographical coordinates to shift by many metres, sometimes as much as several hundred metres. The Prime Meridian of these modern reference systems is 102.5 metres east of the Greenwich <b>astronomical</b> <b>meridian</b> represented by the stainless steel strip, which is now 5.31 arcseconds West.

This treatise included many medicinal applications, including the use of ephedrin as a pharmaceutical drug. He also was the author of a large celestial atlas of five different star maps, and his extensive written and illustrative work in cartography helped solve a heated border dispute between the Song dynasty and its Khitan neighbor of the Liao dynasty. However, Su was most famous for his hydraulic-powered astronomical clock tower, crowned with a mechanically driven armillary sphere, which was erected in the capital city of Kaifeng in the year 1088. Su's clock tower employed the escapement mechanism two centuries before it was applied in clocks of Europe. Su's clock tower also featured the earliest known endless power-transmitting chain drive in the world, as outlined in his horological treatise of 1092. The cases of these two men display the eagerness of the Song in drafting highly skilled officials who were knowledgeable in the various sciences which could ultimately benefit the administration, the military, the economy, and the people.|$|E
