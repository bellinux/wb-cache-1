50|$|The I-3U was {{modified}} from the unfinished I-3; the fuselage was stretched 93 cm (from 12.27 m to 13.20 m), the nose redesigned {{to accommodate the}} Uragan-1 fire control system (hence the U in the designation) above the inlet and an Almaz search radar with a search/track range of 17 km was fitted in the cone centered in the inlet. Armament consisted of two 30 mm Nudelman-Richter NR-30 cannon with symmetrical <b>auto</b> ranging <b>connected</b> to the radar. In addition to the fire control system, Mikoyan-Gurevich also used, for the first time, titanium alloys in the rear fuselage where high temperatures were expected.

500|$|The {{portion of}} NY37 from Redwood to Malone was {{originally}} {{part of the}} Theodore Roosevelt International Highway, an international <b>auto</b> trail <b>connecting</b> Portland, Maine, on the Atlantic Ocean coast to Portland, Oregon, east of the Pacific Ocean.

In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY3 was rerouted to follow its current routing between Watertown and Plattsburgh. The former routing of NY3 along the St. Lawrence River became part of the new NY37, which utilized a previously unnumbered highway between Watertown and Redwood via Theresa.

5|$|Dating back to 1910, {{the route}} US6 follows was {{originally}} the Great White Way and River-to-River Road. Both were <b>auto</b> trails which <b>connected</b> Council Bluffs and Davenport. When the U.S. Highway System {{was created in}} 1926, the highway was designated U.S. Highway 32. US 32 was renumbered in 1931 as US6 was extended to the west coast. As the Interstate Highway System expanded in the 1950-1970s, US6's importance as a cross-state route was diminished by I-80. As a result, the least-traveled sections of the route were moved onto I-80 {{and control of the}} vacated sections of highway was given to local jurisdictions.|$|R
50|$|US 75 {{was one of}} the {{original}} U.S. Highways to be created in 1926, though its roots trace back nine years prior {{to the creation of the}} King of Trails, a 2000 mi <b>auto</b> trail that <b>connected</b> Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Galveston, Texas. In the Upper Midwest, there were two branches of the King of Trails that converged at Sioux City, which then continued south to Council Bluffs. In 1920, the Iowa State Highway Commission assigned route numbers to roads in order to improve wayfinding for travelers. The King of Trails was assigned Primary Road No. 12 (No. 12) from Council Bluffs to Sioux City and the western branch and No. 22 along the eastern branch. In 1926, the U.S. Highway 75 name was applied through Iowa to Primary Roads No. 12 and 22, the King of Trails route.|$|R
5000|$|The Arrowhead Trail, an <b>auto</b> trail <b>connecting</b> Salt Lake City with Los Angeles, {{initially}} took {{a longer}} route via present US 95 and former US 66 between Las Vegas and Needles, {{as the more}} direct Old Spanish Trail was in very poor condition. The [...] "Silver Lake cutoff", which would save about 90 miles (145 km), was proposed by 1920, and completed in 1925 as an oiled road by San Bernardino County. The Bureau of Public Roads {{and the state of}} Nevada both urged its inclusion in the state highway system, the former as part of the federal aid highway connecting Salt Lake City and Los Angeles, and the state legislature did that in 1925, with it becoming an extension of Route 31. (Across the state line, State Route 6 continued through Las Vegas to Arizona.) The initial plan for the U.S. Highway system simply stated that Route No. 91 would run from Las Vegas [...] "to an intersection with Route No. 60" [...] (which became US 66 in 1926), but in 1926 the cutoff was chosen, ending at US 66 at Daggett, just east of Barstow. (The roadway south from Las Vegas later became part of US 95.) The route was added to the federal-aid secondary system in 1926, which helped pay for a mid-1930s widening and paving, including some realignments (parts of the old road are now known as Arrowhead Trail). The new routing generally followed the present I-15, except through Baker (where it used Baker Boulevard) and into Barstow (where it followed former SR 58 to First Avenue, ending at Main Street, which carried US 66).|$|R
5000|$|The major stunt {{scenes were}} {{executed}} before the camera with no miniatures, no blue screens, while mostly being shot at night. Completed during May 1990, the centerpiece stunt {{of the film}} involved a Mercedes-Benz convertible driving through the fourth floor window of an exploding warehouse. For the scene, a 1,500 pound Mercedes <b>auto</b> mock-up was <b>connected</b> by 150 feet of quarter-inch pulleyed cable to a Ford 4×4 pickup on the ground. The truck would drive straight ahead and pull the Mercedes through the windows as the cable that connected the two vehicles exhibited a tensile strength of 8,000 pounds. Once the pull on the cable started, both vehicles would move in precise proportion to one another. After the mock-up launched through the windows, the hook connecting the Mercedes would drop. As Frazier explained, [...] "The hook {{is very similar to}} the kind used to launch jets on aircraft carriers, ... Once the hook falls away, the Mercedes is propelled by its own momentum." [...] Aerodynamics {{played a key role in}} the execution, as Frazier referred to the stunt saying, [...] "When the car left the building it was very important that it exit and travel flat, ... A lot of times it doesn't matter. In this case, if the car didn't travel flat, you would know that the car could not have survived into the next sequence where it landed on the rooftop. We had to set up aerodynamics on that car, so that every time it went out the window, including the tests, it flew out without the nose dipping down." [...] The explosion filled destruction of the warehouse was produced by 9 separate 18-inch steel mortars on each of the 4 floors. When fully discharged, all 36 mortars produced the largest orchestrated explosion ever allowed in Los Angeles city limits permitted at the time.|$|R
40|$|A {{stable and}} {{reliable}} {{electric power supply}} system is an inevitable pre-requisite for the technological and economic growth of any nation. Due to this, utilities must strive and ensure that the customer s reliability requirements are met and the regulators requirements satisfied at the lowest possible cost. It is known fact {{around the world that}} 90 % of the of the customer service interruptions are caused due to failure in distribution system. Therefore, it is worth considering reliability worth assessments as it provides an opportunity to incorporate the cost or losses incurred by the utilities customer as a result of power failure and this must be considered in planning and operating practices. The system modeling and simulation study is carried out on one of the district s distribution system which consists of 33 kV and 11 kV network in Bhutan. The reliability assessment is done on both 11 and 33 kV system to assess the performance of the present system and also predictive reliability analysis for the future system considering load growth and system expansion. The alternative which gives low SAIDI, SAIFI and minimum breakeven costs are being assessed and considered. The reliability of 33 kV system could be further improved by installation of load break switch, <b>auto</b> recloser and <b>connecting</b> with line coming from other district (reserve) at reasonable break even cost. The decision base could be further improved by having Bhutan s context interruption cost. However, the questionnaire s which may be used in Bhutan to acquire interruption costs from the customers are being proposed. The utility should have their own reliability improvement strategy depending upon their needs and requirements of the regulators. Although there is no magic bullet in managing power quality issues, utilities can maximize network performance and better serve customers by diligently addressing trouble prone areas. In order to achieve this objective, a computer program NetBas/Lesvik is used to run load flow and reliability analysis, thus selecting the alternatives either based on reliability indices or on cost benefit ratio. </p...|$|R
