50|$|<b>Automotive</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Integrity</b> <b>Level</b> {{refers to}} an {{abstract}} classification of inherent safety risk in an automotive system or elements of such a system. ASIL classifications are used within ISO 26262 to express the level of risk reduction required to prevent a specific hazard, with ASIL D representing the highest and ASIL A the lowest. The ASIL assessed for a given hazard is then assigned to the safety goal set to address that hazard and is then inherited by the safety requirements derived from that goal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Automotive</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Integrity</b> <b>Level</b> (ASIL) {{is a risk}} {{classification}} scheme defined by the ISO 26262 - Functional Safety for Road Vehicles standard. This is an adaptation of the Safety Integrity Level used in IEC 61508 for the automotive industry. This classification helps defining the safety requirements necessary to be {{in line with the}} ISO 26262 standard. The ASIL is established by performing a risk analysis of a potential hazard by looking at the Severity, Exposure and Controllability of the vehicle operating scenario. The safety goal for that hazard in turn carries the ASIL requirements.|$|E

30|$|As {{a result}} of this step, safety goals are defined as {{top-level}} safety requirements, which have to be incrementally refined during the safety assurance lifecycle. Usually, any safety requirement consists of a functional part and an associated <b>integrity</b> <b>level.</b> The functional part defines what the system must (not) do, whereas the <b>integrity</b> <b>level</b> defines the rigor demanded for the implementation and verification of this requirement. The <b>integrity</b> <b>level</b> depends on the risk associated with the hazardous event that is addressed by the safety goal. For example, ISO 26262 defines so-called <b>automotive</b> <b>safety</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>levels</b> (ASIL).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Automotive</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Integrity</b> <b>Levels</b> (ASILs) {{are used}} by ISO 26262, the new <b>automotive</b> {{functional}} <b>safety</b> standard, to categorize the stringency of safety requirements. In {{the course of a}} hierarchical system design, ASILs are iteratively allocated to subsystems and components. This ASIL decomposition allows for redundant elements to share the responsibility of meeting a given ASIL and finding efficient decomposition solutions has a significant, positive, impact on development costs. This paper describes a novel technique that uses Tabu Search to explore the solution space efficiently. We have applied the technique to a case study of a hybrid braking system...|$|R

ETCS is regarded as a safety-critical component, whereby ETCS malfunction can cause unintended acceleration or deceleration event, which can be hazardous to riders. In this study, Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment, an ISO 26262 functional safety standard analysis has been applied on motorbike’s ETCS to determine the required <b>automotive</b> <b>safety</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>level.</b> Based on the analysis, the established <b>automotive</b> <b>safety</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>level</b> can help to derive technical and functional safety measures for ETCS development...|$|E
40|$|In ISO- 26262, the <b>Automotive</b> <b>safety</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>level</b> (ASIL) {{represents}} {{the degree of}} rigour that should be applied in the development, implementation and verification of a requirement {{in order to reduce}} and control the risk in the final product. The ASILs are allocated to the safety requirements which are inherited by the subsystems and components in a hierarchical approach. During the allocation process, the safety requirements could be decomposed over redundant elements. It is referred to as ASIL decomposition and is an important feature, as it helps to reduce the complexity and the development cost of the design. The decomposition could lead, however, to different allocations. In this paper, we propose an approach to find all the possible allocations in order to assist the analyst in reaching the optimal allocation...|$|E
40|$|ISO 26262, the {{functional}} safety standard for automotive electric and electronic (E/E) systems, requires a controllability assessment {{to be made}} {{as part of the}} hazard and risk classification process. As well as influencing the function’s <b>Automotive</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Integrity</b> <b>Level</b> (ASIL), the verifiable controllability may also limit the functions intervention options and intensity during normal operation. For electric driven vehicles this limits their accident-avoidance/-mitigation potential. For an in-wheel motor driven electric vehicle it is questioned whether the failure of a motor could lead to a risk. It is obvious that the result of the risk assessment depends on the operating scenarios chosen. As numerous factors define a driving situation, the possible detailing of these factors is unlimited. In a previous paper, the results of a study regarding the controllability of a vehicle driven by in-wheel motors using a simplified linear bicycle model were presented. In this paper we extend the previous work by qualitatively and quantitatively identifying the hazards associated with in-wheel motors and by quantify the vehicle level effects that could be expected using validated detailed multibody vehicle models in both straight line and cornering events...|$|E
40|$|Cyber-physical {{systems like}} {{self-driving}} cars are highly complex and safety-critical. This {{results in a}} great number of safety requirements that have different levels of criticality. In automotive, the criticality is categorized in <b>Automotive</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Integrity</b> <b>Levels</b> (ASIL). As a high ASIL causes high development effort, the goal is to develop most subsystems with lower ASIL requirements. To achieve this ASIL tailoring, subsystems need to be separated or redundantly implemented. These safety measures are usually integrated late in the development process and thus cause costly development iterations. In this paper, we present a systematic, tool-supported ASIL tailoring process for the requirements analysis phase. It is applied on formal safety requirements and automatically generated fault trees for a functional view of the system. The process supports early planning of safety efforts for mixed-criticality systems and avoids costly late development iterations...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{overview}} of recently developed data-driven tools for safety analysis of autonomous vehicles and advanced driver assist systems. The core algorithms combine model-based, hybrid system reachability analysis with sensitivity analysis of components with unknown or inaccessible models. We illustrate the applicability of this approach with a new case study of emergency braking systems in scenarios {{with two or three}} vehicles. This problem is representative of {{the most common type of}} rear-end crashes, which is relevant for safety analysis of automatic emergency braking (AEB) and forward collision avoidance systems. We show that our verification tool can effectively prove the safety of certain scenarios (specified by several parameters like braking profiles, initial velocities, uncertainties in position and reaction times), and also compute the severity of accidents for unsafe scenarios. Through hundreds of verification experiments, we quantified the safety envelope of the system across relevant parameters. These results show that the approach is promising for design, debugging and certification. We also show how the reachability analysis can be combined with statistical information about the parameters, to assess the risk level of the control system, which in turn is essential, for example, for determining <b>Automotive</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Integrity</b> <b>Levels</b> (ASIL) for the ISO 26262 standard.

40|$|Efforts in {{securing}} the in-vehicle network {{have resulted in}} a number of proposed security mechanisms in recent years. However, so far little attention has been given to the actual architecture of the in-vehicle network. An approach within in-vehicle network design is to divide the network into domains, where each domain consists of a set of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) that handles some united functionality, e. g., body control, powertrain, and telematics. Still, this approach is based on 'best engineering practice' and there is room for improvements. In this paper, we study real traffic from a modern car and we try to divide the in-vehicle network into domains using automated partitioning algorithms. To find the optimum division, we select four community detection algorithms, known from social network analysis, and we evaluate their ability to find these domains. We conclude that community detection algorithms can be used to identify in-vehicle domains based on the message types (signals) used in the in-vehicle network and we demonstrate this by applying the algorithms to real data. The approach is not limited to only message types, but domains can also be identified based on other criteria, such as frequency of messages, payload sizes, or <b>Automotive</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Integrity</b> <b>Levels</b> (ASILs). We also conclude that the identification of good domains can facilitate the implementation of security measures. Therefore, we believe that the approach has great potential to help engineers in deriving secure in-vehicle network architectures during the design of a vehicle...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of {{intelligent transport systems}} such as driver assistance systems currently faces increasing system complexity {{and a growing number}} of requirements, e. g. from safety standards. Thus, requirements engineering activities gain an increasingly important role when it comes to the {{development of}} safety-critical transport systems. As an example, the introduction of ISO 26262 in the automotive domain requires the adaptation of existing industrial development processes to comply with the upcoming standard. The proposed methods address the new demand in requirements management for a safer development of driver assistance systems. By means of ontologies, domain requirements such as from ISO 26262 are formalized providing a reference model to support semiautomated requirements discovery. Based on this formalized knowledge and an automatically identified selection criterion such as the system’s <b>Automotive</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Integrity</b> <b>Level</b> (ASIL), the large set of process and product related requirements of ISO 26262 is tailored to a reduced set of applicable steps and methods for a project specific development process.

In terms of driver assistance systems, a lane departure warning system is used as an application example to illustrate the proceeding...|$|E
40|$|Safety {{has been}} {{always been an}} {{important}} part, irrespective {{of the field of}} work that it accounts for. The functional safety standard that is currently being used in the automotive domain is the ISO 26262. This is an adaptation of the IEC 61508 safety standard. It is directed as a basic functional safety standard for a variety of industries. The version of ISO 26262 that is used in this thesis is the final draft released in January, 2011. In this thesis, various parts of the ISO 26262 functional safety standard are considered {{in order to understand the}} differences and interdependencies between them. The parts of ISO 26262 that are treated are as follows; Part 1 : Vocabulary, Part 3 : Concept phase, Part 4 : Product development at the system level, Part 6 : Product development at the software level and Part 9 : <b>Automotive</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Integrity</b> <b>Level</b> (ASIL) -oriented and safety-oriented analysis. During the entire course of this thesis the ISO 26262 standard is evaluated and the experience gained from it is jotted down. The understanding gained during this thesis about the ISO 26262 can be applied to ongoing or new development processes. As safety can never be overlooked, the wisdom that belongs to the ISO 26262 can be generously used into embedded systems that demand certain levels of safety...|$|E
40|$|Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment (HARA) {{in various}} domains like automotive, aviation, process {{industry}} etc. {{suffer from the}} issues of validity and reliability. While {{there has been an}} increasing appreciation of this subject, there have been limited approaches to overcome these issues. In the automotive domain, HARA is influenced by the ISO 26262 international standard which details functional safety of road vehicles. While ISO 26262 was a major step towards analysing hazards and risks, like other domains, it is also plagued by the issues of reliability. In this paper, the authors discuss the automotive HARA process. While exposing the reliability challenges of the HARA process detailed by the standard, the authors present an approach to overcome the reliability issues. The approach is obtained by creating a rule-set for automotive HARA to determine the <b>Automotive</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Integrity</b> <b>Level</b> (ASIL) by parametrizing the individual components of an automotive HARA, i. e., severity, exposure and controllability. The initial rule-set was put to test by conducting a workshop involving international functional safety experts as participants in an experiment where rules were provided for severity and controllability ratings. Based on the qualitative results of the experiments, the rule-set was re-calibrated. The proposed HARA approach by the creation of a rule- set demonstrated reduction in variation. However, the caveat {{lies in the fact that}} the rule-set needs to be exhaustive or sufficiently explained in order to avoid any degree of subjective interpretation which is a source of variation and unreliability...|$|E
40|$|Automotive {{embedded}} systems need {{to cope with}} antagonist requirements: on the one hand, the users and market pressure push car manufacturers to integrate more and more services that go far {{beyond the control of}} the car itself. On the other hand, recent standardization efforts in the safety domain has {{led to the development of}} the ISO 26262 norm that defines means and requirements to ensure the safe operation of automotive {{embedded systems}}. In particular, it led to the definition of ASIL (<b>Automotive</b> <b>Safety</b> and <b>Integrity</b> <b>Levels),</b> i. e., it formally defines several criticality levels. Handling the increased complexity of new services makes new architectures, such as multi or many-cores, appealing choices for the car industry. Yet, these architectures provide a very low level of timing predictability due to shared resources, which goes in contradiction with timing guarantees required by ISO 26262. For highest criticality level tasks, Worst-Case Execution Time analysis (WCET) is required to guarantee that timing constraints are respected. The WCET analyzers consider the worst-case scenario: whenever a critical task accesses a shared resource in a multi/many-core platform, a WCET analyzer considers that all cores use the same resource concurrently. To improve the system performance, we proposed in a earlier work an approach where a critical task can be run in parallel with less critical tasks, as long as the real-time constraints are met. When no further interferences can be tolerated, the proposed run-time control suspends the low critical tasks until the termination of the critical task. In an automotive context, the approach can be translated as a highly critical partition, namely a classic AUTOSAR one, that runs on one dedicated core, with several cores running less critical Adaptive AUTOSAR application(s). We briefly describe the design of our proven-correct approach. Our strategy is based on a graph grammar to formally model the critical task as a set of control flow graphs on which a safe partial WCET analysis is applied and used at run-time to control the safe execution of the critical task...|$|R

40|$|The {{new demands}} and {{expectations}} of customers and the standard ISO 26262 forces companies in the automotive sector to fast and flexibly develop innovative, yet functional safe products. The standard postulates the requirement to detect random electrical and electronical faults in the products. If such a fault is detected, the product must be brought into a safe state to prevent damage to the passengers and other traffic participants. To fulfill these requirements, {{it is necessary to}} define a transparent and traceable <b>Automotive</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Integrity</b> <b>Level</b> (ASIL) classification {{at the beginning of the}} product development process, as well as to establish an exchange process for interfaces, data and functions across department and corporate boundaries. The ASIL defines the requirements for the functional safety. The methodology developed has the goal to support and solve three of the main issues regarding the development of mechatronic products in context of ISO 26262. Those issues are the definition of an ASIL based on the target market, the handling of interface data across the complete development chain as well as to ensure a traceable and continuous implementation and documentation of requirements. This work analyzes the factors influencing the ASIL, which in consequence allows the definition of those factors with respect to the specific target market. In the further course of the work, an IT architecture based on the hazard and risk analysis (created with the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis; abbr. FMEA) was developed and implemented. This IT concept transforms the FMEA data into a new, extended data model, which is capable of handling data across company boundaries. This enhanced and easily extendable data model can contain all relevant and important information and relationships, as well as the possibility to document the realization of requirements. The approach and the model were validated within a research project in the field of emobility. The validation process has shown that the centralization and transparency of the data leads to an accelerated product development and to a reduced number of faults, which itself leads to higher level of safety...|$|E
