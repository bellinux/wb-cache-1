500|$|Gibraltar's inhospitable terrain made it {{an unpopular}} place to live. To boost the population, convicts from the kingdom of Granada were offered the {{possibility}} of serving their sentence in the Gibraltar garrison as an <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison.</b> Despite its apparent unattractiveness, Juan Alfonso de Guzmán, third Duke of Medina Sidonia, nonetheless sought {{to regain control of}} the town. In September 1506, following Isabella's death, he laid siege in the expectation that the gates would quickly be opened to his forces. This did not happen, and after a fruitless four-month blockade he gave up the attempt. Gibraltar received the title of [...] "Most Loyal" [...] from the Spanish crown in recognition of its faithfulness.|$|E
500|$|Likewise {{a person}} {{charged with a}} non-indictable {{criminal}} offense, including those being adjudicated in juvenile court, may request alcohol treatment in lieu of criminal prosecution. If a physician attests that the defendant is an alcoholic, the court may impose inpatient treatment for up to 30 days, outpatient treatment for up to 60 days, or both. If the person successfully completes the treatment program, the criminal charges will be dismissed. A person with alcohol dependency who {{has been charged with}} an indictable crime may apply for [...] "special probation" [...] (also known as drug court). Those charged with severe violent crimes (e.g. murder, kidnapping) are not eligible, but people charged with offenses with mandatory sentences, or who have extensive non-violent criminal records may be eligible. If admitted to special probation, the defendant will be subject to 18 months to 5 years of intense probation and residential treatment as an <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 1992 the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections {{opened the}} Quehanna Motivational Boot Camp at Piper as the state's [...] "first military-style motivational boot camp". The minimum {{security}} program for non-violent, first-time offenders has accepted {{both male and}} female inmates from the start. Originally designed to house 200, the Department of Corrections expanded the facility in the late 1990s to a capacity of 500 on about [...] The inmates spend six months in a military-style program that offers opportunities for education and builds positive life skills; they also are offered drug and alcohol therapy. Those who successfully complete the boot camp program, which is considered an <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison,</b> are released on parole. The boot camp began to receive men and women from the [...] "general population of state prison inmates" [...] in 2005 and 2006, respectively. At the end of June 2009, the facility had 494inmates, 61percent of whom were in the boot camp program, and cost just over $17million a year to operate.|$|E

2500|$|The Probation Act 1907 {{established}} a probation service to provide supervision {{within the community}} for young offenders as an <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison.</b> In 1908, the Children and Young Persons Act 1908 formed part of the [...] "Children's Charter" [...] which imposed punishments for those neglecting children. It became illegal to sell children tobacco, alcohol and fireworks or to send children begging. Juvenile courts and borstals were created instead for young offenders so {{they did not have}} to stand in adult courts and go to adult prisons for most offences. The 1908 Education (Scotland) Act enforced medical inspection, free books and travel, free meals and clothing grants, and some bursaries.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, the police {{actively}} enforced laws prohibiting sexual behaviour between men. By {{the end of}} 1954, there were 1,069 gay men in prison in England and Wales, {{with an average age}} of 37. There were a number of high-profile arrests and trials, including that of scientist, mathematician, and war-time code-breaker Alan Turing, convicted in 1952 of [...] "gross indecency". He accepted treatment with female hormones (chemical castration) as an <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison.</b> Turing committed suicide in 1954. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, in response to a petition, issued an apology on behalf of the British government in 2009 for [...] "the appalling way he was treated". In 1953, the trial and eventual imprisonment of Edward Montagu (the 3rd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu), Michael Pitt-Rivers and Peter Wildeblood for committing acts of [...] "homosexual indecency" [...] caused uproar and led to the establishment of a committee to examine and report on the law covering [...] "homosexual offences" [...] appointed by Sir David Maxwell Fyfe and Sir Hugh Lucas-Tooth.|$|E

50|$|Another major {{advantage}} {{is the fact}} that wide deployment of electronic monitoring may lead to reduced prison populations. This is most likely where monitoring is used as an <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison,</b> rather than to enhance existing non-custodial orders. Major cost savings may be achieved through building fewer prisons as well as reducing the cost of administering custodial sentences.|$|E

5000|$|To {{offset the}} costs of prisons and burgeoning growth in the incarceration rate, in 2014 state legislators passed a law {{providing}} a [...] "sweeping plan" [...] for <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison</b> for some non-violent prisoners, such as monitored house arrest.

50|$|Judges {{have imposed}} {{sentences}} of home confinement, as an <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison,</b> {{as far back}} as the 1900s. Galileo was confined to his home following his infamous trial in the 1600s.

50|$|Senator Whitmire {{worked closely}} with his colleagues and was {{successful}} in obtaining funding for the largest expansion of treatment and rehabilitation programs in decades.

50|$|The prison {{abolition}} movement attempts <b>to</b> eliminate <b>prisons</b> and {{the prison}} system. Prison abolitionists see the prisons as an ineffective way to decrease crime and reform criminals. They also believe the modern {{criminal justice system}} to be racist, sexist, and classist. One of the many arguments made for prison abolition is {{that the majority of}} people accused of crime cannot afford to pay a lawyer. The Anarchist Black Cross was a key group involved in the prison abolition movement that still persists today. A variety of proposed <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> <b>prisons</b> arose from the prison abolition movement.|$|R
50|$|More serious crimes, {{required}} {{an element of}} punishment in an environment away from older prisoners followed by education to reform their ways.

5000|$|Regarding {{criminal}} justice, Maudling made no attempt, {{despite his}} personal support, to reintroduce capital punishment after its abolition in 1969. He introduced Community Service, a new <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison,</b> and in 1971 modestly tightened the immigration rules. He was criticised for ordering the deportation of Rudi Dutschke, later {{one of the}} founders of the German Green Party. Dutschke, who was in Britain to recuperate from an assassination attempt, was considered a student anarchist.|$|E
50|$|In practice, {{mental health}} {{professionals}} rarely treat psychopathic personality disorders as they are considered untreatable and no interventions {{have proved to be}} effective. In England and Wales the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder is grounds for detention in secure psychiatric hospitals under the Mental Health Act 1983 if the individual has committed a serious crime. But since such individuals are disruptive for other patients and are not responsive to treatment this <b>alternative</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison</b> is not often used.|$|E

The authors argue that while RAP patently did not succeed in abolishing prisons, it did contribute to significant changes in the debate over crime and punishment.

40|$|This {{chapter is}} based on {{research}} funded by the Esmee Fairbairn Foundation: Re-thinking Crime and Punishment. It argues that crime dramas are just as influential as crime news in shaping public understanding of sentencing. Sentencing issues have relatively low media priority. Crime is more dramatic and appealing to audiences than punishment. Even avid consumers of media crime can avoid reflecting on punishment {{because of the way}} crime narratives are typically structured. This makes securing public approval for <b>alternatives</b> <b>to</b> <b>prison</b> more difficult. This research and chapter is widely cited and contributed to storylines about the value of community based sentencing in three soap operas...|$|R
