40|$|Larvae- are soil dwelling, legless {{and have}} a brown head with black jaws. The larva of <b>apple</b> <b>weevil</b> is similar to garden weevil, spotted {{vegetable}} weevil and sitona weevil. A microscope is required to identify the actual weevil type in the larval stage. • Adult- medium sized about 8 mm long and uniform brown weevil. It has a slightly bulbous abdomen. The adult weevils are flightless and all are females. Habits • Adult weevils feed at night. They are inactive {{during the day and}} shelter under bark, in the crotch of branches, between fruit and leaves, and burrow into soil around the base of trees. • When disturbed they fall to the ground and quickly walk away. Life cycle • Eggs are laid in loose organic matter on the soil and hatch in 10 - 14 days. • Young larvae are mobile; they immediately burrow into the soil to feed on plant roots. • Larvae develop slowly during winter and more rapidly as soil temperature increases in spring. They pupate in October/November...|$|E

40|$|Monitoring {{was carried}} out in 2014 in apple {{orchards}} Starý Lístovec (Brno-venkov). The effectiveness of environmentally friendly (Quassia amara, Spruzit-Flussig, SpinTor), synthetic insecticide Calypso 480 SC (thiacloprid) in combination with orange oil PREV-B 2 on hibernating adults were compared. The results were inconclusive due to inclement weather conditions. The most attractive variety were triploid variety Jonagold and second Champion. The influence of selected products (Quassia amara Spruzit-Flussig, SpinTor, Calypso 480 SC) on mortality and activity of <b>apple</b> blossom <b>weevil</b> was investigated in laboratory 24, 48, and 120 hours after application. Degree of leaf damage (%) 120 hours after application was evaluated. The highest efficiency (88 % mortality) reached SpinTor (spinosad) 120 hours after application, other products only temporary paralyzed adults. Spruzit-Flussig, SpinTor and Calypso 480 SC inhibit the activity of <b>apple</b> blossom <b>weevil,</b> they may reduce damage by pests, and therefore they can be recommended for application in the spring during feeding of adults...|$|R
50|$|He {{is known}} for his {{extensive}} research of phylloxera, publishing a number of papers on means of destroying its eggs during the winter (1885, 1887-88). Also he performed studies on the natural history of the <b>apple</b> blossom <b>weevil,</b> proposing methods for its eradication (1891). On behalf of the Marine Fisheries Advisory Committee, he did reviews involving the sale and consumption of mussels throughout the year.|$|R

It is an {{excellent}} insectide and acaricide for ochard pests, including <b>apple</b> flea <b>weevil,</b> plum curculio and coddling moth and for some soil insects1 It is also good to use against the following pests: rice stem borer, boll weevils, oriental fruit moth, fruit moths, codling moths, cotton bollworms,peachtree borers, pear psylla, aphids, scale, budmoths, leafrollers, mites, European cornborrers, aphids, thrips, armyworms, leaf miners, mexican beetles and many others14.|$|R
40|$|In the Czech Republic, apple {{orchards}} cover {{an area of}} 7. 975, {{of which}} almost 55 % involve superannuated plantations. The research {{was carried out in}} the Agricultural and Trade Cooperation - Orchards Starý Lískovec, which farm on 105. 5. ha. In the thesis, a detailed description of the <b>apple</b> blossom <b>weevil</b> is given, including its biology, ecological requirements, harmful effects, and ways of its monitoring and regulation. The thesis also includes a chapter that is dedicated to resistance of the parasite against commonly used insecticides. The efficiency of natural insecticides Spintor and Spruzit-Flüssig was compared to a common insecticide Calypso 480 SC. As a result, Spruzit-Flüssig seemed to be the most efficient (80 %), in comparison with the least efficient Calypso 480 SC (50 %). During the beginning of vegetation in 2015, the observations were made in order to discover the species preference of the <b>apple</b> blossom <b>weevil.</b> Jonagold was determined as most attacked cultivar, since in different areas of the orchard, 207 blossoms of 400 were attacked. On the contrary, Idared and Gloster revealed no evidence of having been attacked. Furthermore, ingestion activity of insect after insecticide application was observed; in all cases, the ingestion activity was inhibited...|$|R
50|$|Perillene is {{a natural}} {{monoterpene}} that consists of a furan ring with a six-carbon homoprenyl side chain. Perillene is {{a component of the}} essential oil obtained by extraction of the leaves of Perilla frutescens. Perillene has also been obtained by steam distillation of the leaves of Perilla frutescens. Perillene has been found to elicit distinct electrophysiological responses in the antennae of the <b>apple</b> blossom <b>weevil.</b> It has been suggested that perillene is one several terpene hydrocarbons in the emanation bouquet of apple tree buds which may be used by adult weevils as chemical cues to discrimination during host-searching behavior.|$|R
50|$|Animals {{are called}} pests when they cause damage to {{agriculture}} by feeding on crops or parasitising livestock, such as codling moth on <b>apples,</b> or boll <b>weevil</b> on cotton. An animal {{could also be}} a pest when it causes damage to a wild ecosystem or carries germs within human habitats. Examples of these include those organisms which vector human disease, such as rats and fleas which carry the plague disease, mosquitoes which vector malaria, and ticks which carry Lyme disease.|$|R
40|$|Vision is {{considered}} to be {{an important component of the}} sensory system used by herbivorous insects to locate host plants. We investigated preferences for transmissive colors and contrasts in the <b>apple</b> blossom <b>weevil,</b> Anthonomus pomorum L., which colonizes apple trees, Malus domestica Borkh., in early spring. The main components of the supposed visual system, green, blue, and UV light, were offered to the weevils versus black or versus each other in a dual choice arena. Furthermore, silhouettes of two different achromatic contrasts were offered in front of the colors blue and green. We also tested whether visual preferences change with time, i. e., 2, 4, and 6 d after termination of diapause in early spring. Female weevils chose UV, green, and blue over black, whereas males only chose UV over black in a series of dual choice experiments. Both sexes preferred blue to green. Weevil response to silhouettes of different contrasts was influenced by the background color, i. e., the silhouette with the higher contrast was preferred in front of green, whereas the silhouette with the lower contrast was preferred in front of blue. The preferences during visual orientation did not change with time after diapause. The more discriminating response of females may reflect a greater visual acuity or a greater visual responsiveness in females than in males because of a higher affinity for the host plant. Our findings indicate that weevils might have a trichromatic visual system and that they are able to include visual cues for the location of host plants in the fiel...|$|R
