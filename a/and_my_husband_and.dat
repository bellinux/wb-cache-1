Their son, Darius John Rubin, was born in 2000. Having previously lived in London, they moved back to New York City in 2010, where they rented an apartment in Manhattan's Upper West Side. But in May 2013, Rubin announced that the family would return to London to work on several projects, and in October of the same year, Amanpour stated {{that she and her}} husband would be relocating to London permanently: [...] "Right now I'd have to say that London is my home... My family are in England, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> I are loving reacquainting ourselves with all the friends we left behind".|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{opened my}} door," [...] {{continued}} Mary, [...] "and listened. In {{a few minutes}} a bell rang violently. Dorcas came running down <b>and</b> woke <b>my</b> <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> we all went to my mother-in-law's room, but it was locked----" ...|$|R
60|$|They gave {{my darling}} into <b>my</b> arms, <b>and</b> through many weeks I never left her. The little {{child who was}} to have done so much was born before the turf was planted on its father's grave.

6000|$|... "Yes, but I'm {{ashamed to}} let them know about it, because they all said I'd repent; <b>and</b> then he's <b>my</b> <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> he's the father of my children." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh,' she shrieked with rage, 'you {{have killed}} my daughters <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> {{all the men}} {{belonging}} to me; how can I get at you to avenge myself?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{for what}} our gentlemen say, sir," [...] cries Mrs. Lambert to Mr. Spencer, [...] "you must not believe {{a word of}} it. 'Tis a {{delightful}} piece, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> Mr. George behaved as ill as possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|In England {{we should}} {{certainly}} {{not have done}} all this in public, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> I were terribly put to the blush; indeed, I felt my whole head and neck burning, and {{caught a glimpse of}} myself in a dreadful mirror, my white bridal dress and flaxen hair making my fiery face look, my brothers would have said, 'as if I had been skinned.' ...|$|E
25|$|She played {{opposite}} her husband, William Moore (1916–2000), in several series, including two episodes of The Liver Birds <b>and</b> again in <b>My</b> <b>Husband</b> <b>and</b> I, on both occasions as a married couple.

60|$|CLEOPATRA (eagerly, {{her eyes}} {{lighting}} up). I will tell you. A beautiful young man, with strong round arms, {{came over the}} desert with many horsemen, <b>and</b> slew <b>my</b> sister's <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> gave <b>my</b> father back his throne.

6000|$|... "Yes, I was in {{a prison}} house," [...] she answered, [...] "and I should have welcomed any jailer {{who had come to}} set me free. I married him, and {{sometimes}} I try to do my duty.

6000|$|... "Hearing of a {{situation}} at this place (also that our expenses would be paid if we applied personally), we got leave of absence, and made our application.

Suffice it to say that we have refused to accept starvation wages, and that we are still out of place. It is just possible that you may have heard of something to suit us. So I write at once, knowing that good chances are often lost through needless delay.|$|E

We've been used to trouble, and don't look for much else. It's only the thought o' my poor children pulls me i' two." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{this thing}} {{gave me a}} terrible shock, for it {{happened}} just after I was married, and served to hasten my going over to Holland; for I {{would not have been}} seen, so as to be known by the name of Roxana, no, not for ten thousand pounds; it would have been enough to have ruined me to all intents <b>and</b> purposes with <b>my</b> <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> everybody else too; I {{might as well have been}} the [...] "German princess." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But for my unhappy invitation," [...] she said, [...] "Bridgenorth {{would not}} have been at the Castle on the morning which succeeded the feast, {{would not have}} seen the Countess, and would not have {{incurred}} the resentment <b>and</b> opposition of <b>my</b> <b>husband.</b> <b>And</b> but for the King's return, an event which was so anxiously expected as the termination of all our calamities, neither the noble lady nor ourselves had been engaged in this new path of difficulty and danger." ...|$|R
500|$|It {{takes me}} back to being in my car as a teenager.

I kinda had this whole fantasy {{of being in the}} car, and this whole movie played in my head. I didn't have a pen and paper. I got to the mic, I'm like, 'Oh, press Record.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never. I {{ought to}} tell you, {{that a few}} years ago my sister married for the second time. I disapproved of the marriage, and refused to see her husband or his son--he was a widower. A few weeks ago, for private reasons, I went over to England, where they are living, and asked my sister to let the boy come here to work in my husband's office. She refused, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> I {{returned}} to New York. This morning I was astonished to get a telephone call from Mr. Pett from his office, to say that James Crocker had unexpectedly arrived after all, and was then at the office. They came up here, and the young man seemed quite genuine. Indeed, he had an offensive jocularity which would be quite in keeping with the character of the real James Crocker, from what I have heard of him." ...|$|E

5000|$|I had so {{much fun}} doing it. It was all cut live. It was cut here in Tennessee, at Lieper's Fork. And we had a BLAST! Ricky Skaggs came out and played {{mandolin}} and sang. Travis Tritt, he played guitar and sang. John Randall, you know he has a WONDERFUL voice and it's just great. We got to cut these wonderful old tunes <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> I wrote some songs for it and I was just thrilled to death to do it...." ...|$|E
6000|$|ARETHUSA. And {{yet this}} pain is our natural lot. Father, I fear to boast, but I know that I can bear it.

5000|$|Her {{research}} on positive illusions was also influential in her personal life.

I've evolved and matured as a person and so has my music. It’s lyrically very real." [...] In her 2016 memoir, Ford disowned the album.|$|E

Ordauro resorted, as before, to a bold expedient.
