40|$|Introduction: We have {{assessed}} {{the effects of}} the inner ear acoustic trauma on the amplitude of the first (I) and fifth (V) wave of the auditory brainstem evoked response (ABR). The aim was to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of the auditory brainstem evoked potentials amplitude in predicting the hearing threshold. Material and Methods: The ABR and pure tone <b>audiometric</b> <b>recording</b> were taken from 132 patients exposed to acute acoustic trauma. The amplitude of the I and V ABR wave was recorded for 80 dB HL click stimulation. Test of multiple regression was performed to establish the best diagnostic combination of the I, V and V/I ABR amplitude ratio on the hearing threshold prediction at 500 Hz, 1 kHz i 2 kHz frequencies. Results and Discussion: The direct correlation was eminent between the hearing threshold and amplitude of the I wave ABR (R= 0. 065, R= 0. 048 i R= 0. 01, p< 0. 05) for all of the tested frequencies. The amplitude of I and V wave of ABR significantly predicts haring threshold in cochlear injury related to acoustic trauma (r 2 = 0. 057, p< 0. 05). Amplitude of the V wave was in reverse correlation to hearing threshold on all of the examined frequencies. Conclusion: The amplitudes of the I and V ABR waves, and V/I ABR wave ratio were significantly correlated with hearing threshold at 500 Hz, 1 kHz i 2 kHz in patients with cochlear damage secondary to acoustic trauma. Inner ear injury results in significant increase of I wave amplitude, yet followed by the decrease in V wave ABR amplitude...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} long term {{exposure}} to excessive levels of aircraft noise {{have been considered}} {{to be one of}} the major factors causing permanent hearing loss of the military Background and Objective: Hearing impairment from noise exposure has been reported in fix-wing pilots, especially in civilized countries. However, there are few studies on rotary wing aviators and aircraft mechanics, especially in developing countries whose hearing conservative program is not well established. The present study, therefore, was done to evaluate the prevalence of noise induced hearing loss and the contributing factors that may effect both groups of noise-exposed population. Material and Method: Report questionnaires were reviewed and physical examination combined with <b>audiometric</b> <b>records</b> of 34 pilots and 42 mechanics in the Royal Thai Army Aviation Center, Lobburi, were examined. Hearing loss was studied using four categories of significant threshold shift (STS). Amplitude of noise radiated by aircraft was also measured at different distances. Results: No significant difference was found in prevalence of hearing loss in aviators (32. 4 %) and aircraft mechanics (47. 6 %), but in the aircraft mechanics group there were more damage of frequency involvemen...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Audiometric</b> <b>records</b> of 449 male manual {{steelworkers}} {{were reviewed}} {{to see whether}} the hearing of men with high initial threshold levels deteriorated more rapidly than that of those men with more normal thresholds when exposed to similar noise levels. Subjects were between 15 and 54 {{years old at the time}} of initial examination, and had a repeat audiogram 6 - 8 years later. They were classified into three occupational noise exposure groups: below 90 dB(A), 90 - 99 dB(A), and 100 dB(A) or over, without knowledge of their audiometric threshold levels, age, or aural history. Measurements at 0 · 5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 kHz for the right ear were considered, first as the mean for all six frequencies, then for 0 · 5, 1 and 2 kHz only, and finally for 6 kHz only. After standardisation for age, it was found that those in the high initial threshold groups deteriorated no faster than the remainder of the series. At the 90 - 99 dB(A) noise exposure level, χ 2 tests showed that the differences between the groups, in terms of mean measured hearing loss, were not significant at the 0 · 05 probability level. The age-standardised mean threshold shifts for the 0 · 5 - 6 kHz range of frequencies over the seven-year review period were 7 · 5, 8 · 7 and 7 · 1 dB at a noise exposure level of 100 dB(A) or more, for workers with an initial threshold level of 26 dB respectively; for those exposed to noise of 90 - 99 dB(A) the corresponding mean shifts were 7 · 8, 6 · 8 and 7 · 3 dB respectively; while for those exposed to noise of less than 90 dB(A) the mean shifts were 6 · 2, 5 · 0 and 5 · 2 dB respectively...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Chronic {{suppurative}} {{otitis media}} still remains {{a major cause}} of conductive hearing loss in our country. But, a few patients also display an added sensorineural hearing loss. MATERIALS & METHODS Hundred patients with CSOM undergoing surgery at our department were included in the study. The affected ears formed the ‘CSOM Group’ and the normal ears formed the ‘Control group’. Detailed otological history, clinical, surgical and <b>audiometric</b> findings were <b>recorded</b> and analysed. RESULTS It was inferred that CSOM associated with sensorineural hearing loss was found in small number of patients only. No correlation was established between duration of discharge and sensorineural loss. CONCLUSION Though greater SN loss was seen in patients of CSOM with cholesteatoma it was not statistically significant. Whether an early surgery in CSOM can prevent SN loss or not needs further studies...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Hearing {{impairment}} due to cochlear {{damage is}} one complication of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM 2). Objective: This study aims {{to determine the}} relationship between duration of DM 2 with hearing impairment. Method: The analytic observasional study with the cross sectional design using the medical record of DM 2 outpatient in internal clinic of Islamic Sultan Agung Hospital Semarang and also pure tone <b>audiometric</b> examinationâ€™s <b>record</b> in Otorynolaryngology clinic of Islamic Sultan Agung Hospital Semarang. 31 medical records of DM 2 patients were meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The data consist of 18 medical records of patients with less than 6 years duration of DM 2, and 13 medical records of patients with more than 6 years duration of DM 2. The pure tone audiometry was used to classified the hearing impairment. The data analysis was conducted using SPSS 20. 0. The correlation between the duration of DM 2 and hearing impairment was analyzed using Chi Square test. The significance relation between the duration of DM type 2 and hearing impairment was analyzed using cooficient contigency, with significance of < 0. 05.

40|$|Objective:The thalassemias {{are among}} the most common genetic {{disorders}} worldwide, occurring more frequently in the Mediterranean region. The aim {{of this study was to}} determined frequency of sensory-neural hearing loss in major ß- thalassemias transfusion dependent patients in south of Iran. Methods:A cross sectional study on 308 cases of major beta-thalassemia patients referring to Thalassemia Center of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences between 2006 - 2007 years. The diagnosis of ß- thalassemia major was based on clinical history, complete blood count and hemoglobine electrophoresis. Clinical data such as serum ferritin level, deferoxamine (DFO) dose, mean daily doses of DFO (mg/kg) and <b>audiometric</b> variables was <b>recorded.</b> Findings:Out of 308 cases, 283 (96. 5 %) had normal hearing and 10 (3. 5 %) sensorineural hearing loss. There was no statically significant difference between two groups regarding mean age, weight, age at the first blood transfusion, age at the first DFO infusion. Conclusion:We found the lowest incidence of sensorineural hearing loss in a large population of patients suffered from major thalassemia who received DFO. We show that DFO is not ototoxic at a low dose. When considering all related literature, as a whole there has been much critical misrepresentation about DFO ototoxicity...|$|R

Please click on the hyperlink in Additional Links fieldThe {{aim of this study}} was to investigate long-term development of hearing in subjects who had received platinum-based chemotherapy in childhood or adolescence. Another aim was to assess the self-reported hearing loss handicap and compare it to <b>audiometric</b> measurements. Medical <b>records</b> from individuals diagnosed with childhood cancer and treated with platinum-based chemotherapy between 1985 and 2000 at the University Hospital in Lund Sweden were reviewed retrospectively. Fifteen subjects, who fulfilled the eligibility criteria set for the study, underwent a thorough audiometric evaluation. The results show that the hearing loss, in subjects with ototoxicity had increased after the end of treatment, to include also the lower frequencies. The largest deterioration in hearing thresholds, up to 55 dB HL, was found at frequencies above 2 kHz. The findings also reveal that the subjects have a considerably greater hearing loss handicap and disability than would be expected from the results of the audiometric evaluations. The conclusion of this study is that children and adolescence treated with platinum-based chemotherapy should have regular audiometric follow-up examinations, also many years after the end of treatment. Furthermore, assessments of self-reported hearing disability should be made during and after chemotherapy...|$|R
40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis: To provide data on {{the outcome}} of stapes surgery in {{patients}} with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). The audiometric results of 15 ears (12 patients), in which a stapes operation was performed, are presented and compared with results from literature. Study Design: Retrospective study. Methods: In 12 patients with genetically confirmed OI, intraoperative findings and <b>audiometric</b> evaluations were <b>recorded.</b> Results: In all patients the genetic mutation was located in the COL 1 A 1 gene. Surgical findings in OI may be particular like mobile, atrophic stapes crura combined with a fixation of the stapes footplate, which may be thickened, and a hypervascularized or thickened middle-ear mucosa. Outcome for hearing in 13 primary surgered ears was good because at short-term follow-up the air-bone gap was reduced in all cases. These results were maintained in the long-term, with exception of one ear, in which progression of the sensorineural component occurred shortly after the operation. Although initial success was noted in two ears with revision surgery, in the long term this was only maintained in one of them. Conclusions: In general, stapes surgery is successful in resolving the conductive hearing loss in OI patients, even in the long term. Hearing loss in OI is mostly of the mixed type, and the sensorineural component is reported to be progressive. Stapedotomy, by improving the hearing level, may facilitate the rehabilitation with a hearing aid. Because the identified mutation could be located in the COL 1 A 1 gene in all patients, conductive hearing loss in OI caused by stapes fixation is possibly linked to a mutation in this gene...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess, in {{otosclerosis}} surgery, {{whether the}} vein or the tragal perichondrium in stapedotomy with interposition yields the better long-term hearing outcome. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective chart review of prospectively collected audiometric data of 452 ears. SETTING: Academic tertiary otology-neurotology referral center. PATIENTS: Four hundred fifty-two stapedotomies with interposition were performed in 412 patients (bilateral in 40 patients) by the senior author (R. C.) between 1987 and 1998. A tragal perichondrium graft {{was used in}} 314 cases and a vein graft was used in 138 cases as sealing material of the oval window. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <b>Audiometric</b> data were <b>recorded</b> at 4 months, at 1 year, and at 3 years after surgery after American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines, except for thresholds at 3 kHz, which were not available and which were replaced with those at 4 kHz. RESULTS: There were no significant intergroup differences in initial or late postoperative hearing outcome with regard {{to change in the}} pure-tone average bone conduction and air-bone gaps, or sensorineural hearing loss. Ears treated with a vein graft showed statistically better postoperative 2 -kHz air-bone gap closure (p = 0. 0157), but the pure-tone average air-bone gap difference was not significant. Postoperative air-bone gap closure to within 10 dB was achieved in 91 % of cases in the vein group and in 76 % of cases in the perichondrium group. Specific study of the bone conduction level at 4 kHz showed a sensorineural hearing loss greater than 10 dB in 8 % of cases in the vein group and in 11 % of cases in the perichondrium group. One case of complete sensorineural hearing loss was observed with a tragal perichondrium graft (0. 22 %). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the vein should be preferred to the tragal perichondrium in stapedotomy with interposition...|$|R
