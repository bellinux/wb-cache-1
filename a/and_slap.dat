25|$|Acoustically, a djembe is a Helmholtz resonator: the {{frequency}} of the bass is determined by {{the size and shape of}} the shell and independent of the amount of tension on the skin. In contrast, the pitch of tones and slaps rises as the tension of the skin is increased. The bass has a frequency of 65–80Hz. Depending on the size of the drum and the amount of tension on the skin, tone frequency varies from 300Hz to 420Hz <b>and</b> <b>slap</b> frequency from 700Hz to 1000Hz, with audible overtones reaching beyond 4kHz.|$|E
25|$|Graphic {{video footage}} shot by law {{enforcement}} officers in 2009 shows 6 Romani boys aged between 6-16 being forced to strip naked, kiss, <b>and</b> <b>slap</b> each other. It is alleged that the boys were then set upon by police dogs, {{with at least two}} sustaining serious injury. Officers attempted to justify their behaviour {{on the grounds that the}} boys were suspected of theft against an elderly citizen. However, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment by police, regardless of whether a crime has been suspected or committed, is prohibited under international law.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} in {{pitch of the}} sounds arises because the different striking techniques selectively emphasize specific vibrational modes of the drum head. A tone emphasizes the (0,1) mode while suppressing the bass (Helmholtz resonance) and higher-order modes as much as possible. A slap emphasizes the (2,1), (0,2), (3,1), (1,2), and (0,3) modes (as well as higher-order modes) while suppressing the Helmholtz resonance and the (0,1) and (1,1) modes. Skilled players can also produce a medium-pitched sound (between a tone <b>and</b> <b>slap)</b> that is variously called third slap, tonpalo, or lé; this sound emphasizes the (1,1) mode while suppressing all other modes as much as possible.|$|E

25|$|In Fort Worth, Wills met Herman Arnspiger {{and formed}} The Wills Fiddle Band. In 1930 Milton Brown {{joined the group}} as lead vocalist and brought a sense of {{innovation}} and experimentation to the band, and {{became known as the}} Aladdin Laddies and then soon re-named themselves the Light Crust Doughboys due to radio sponsorship by the makers of Light Crust Flour. Brown left the band in 1932 to form the Musical Brownies, the first true Western swing band. Brown added twin fiddles, tenor banjo <b>and</b> <b>slap</b> bass, pointing the music in the direction of swing, which they played on local radio and at dancehalls.|$|E
500|$|The {{humpback}} {{social structure}} is loose-knit. Typically, individuals live {{alone or in}} small, transient groups that disband after a few hours. Groups may stay together longer in summer to forage and feed cooperatively. Longer-term relationships between pairs or small groups, lasting months or even years, have rarely been observed. Some females possibly retain bonds created via cooperative feeding for a lifetime. The humpback's range overlaps with other whale and dolphin species—for instance, the minke whale. Humpback whales often leap out of the water, a behaviour known as [...] "breaching", <b>and</b> <b>slap</b> the water with their fins or tails ...|$|E
500|$|As much as VanDerWerff liked [...] "Rolling in the Deep", he {{felt the}} return of Jesse and its {{resulting}} storyline [...] "was a mess" [...] and [...] "just didn't work". Canning was little moved by the drama surrounding Jesse and Rachel, or the resulting brawl <b>and</b> <b>slap,</b> and Brown thought these developments [...] "lacked any real emotional stakes, and seemed tonally inconsistent with the snarky snap {{of the rest of}} the episode". VanDerWerff found the otherwise excellent final segment marred by Quinn's regression to a [...] "generic bitchy cheerleader" [...] stereotype, which he was saddened by as Agron is among his favorite Glee performers.|$|E

2500|$|Djembe players use {{three basic}} sounds: bass, tone, <b>and</b> <b>slap,</b> which have low, medium, and high pitch, respectively. These sounds are {{achieved}} by varying the striking technique and position. Other sounds are possible (masters achieve {{as many as}} twenty-five distinctly different sounds), but these additional sounds are used rarely, mainly for special effects during a solo performance (djembe kan, literally, [...] "the sound of the djembe"). A skilled player can use the sounds to create very complex rhythmic patterns; the combination of rhythm and the differently pitched sounds often leads an inexpert listener to believe {{that more than one}} drum is being played.|$|E
2500|$|The bass {{sound is}} {{produced}} by striking the drum with the palm and flat fingers {{near the center of}} the skin. Tone <b>and</b> <b>slap</b> are produced by striking the drum closer to the edge; the contact area of the fingers determines whether the sound is a tone or a slap. For a tone, most of the area of the fingers and the edge of the palm contact the skin whereas, for a slap, the contact area is limited to the edge of the palm and the fingertips. The basic sounds are played [...] "open", meaning that the hands rebound immediately after a strike, so the contact time with the skin is as short as possible.|$|E

2500|$|Konishiki {{retained}} his ōzeki ranking for 39 tournaments {{over more}} than six years, but he eventually lost it in November 1993 after two consecutive losing records. However, he continued {{to compete in the}} top division as a maegashira [...] for another four years. Now weighing over , he was very susceptible to belt throws <b>and</b> <b>slap</b> downs by lighter and more agile opponents. Ironically, even though he enjoyed less success, he became progressively more popular with Japanese fans due to his continuous fighting spirit, distinctive bulk and amiable personality. In November 1997, he faced demotion to the second jūryō division and announced his retirement after 15 years in sumo. He had spent 81 consecutive tournaments in the top division and won 649 bouts there.|$|E

2500|$|Numerous {{studies and}} {{professional}} clinical {{experience in the}} field of psychology, both before and after Rind et al.'s publications, have long supported the stance that children cannot consent to sexual activity and that child and adolescent sexual abuse cause harm. The then American Psychological Association CEO Raymond D. Fowler succinctly reiterated the prevailing view in a 1999 letter to Congressman Delay [...] "that children cannot consent to sexual activity with adults," [...] and [...] "sexual activity between children and adults should never be considered or labeled as harmless or acceptable". Others, like Rind et al. and Ulrich et al., counter that that prevailing [...] "simplistic" [...] view of CSA fails to completely account for the variety and complexity of documented sexual experience that many insist, for strong moral reasons, [...] "cannot" [...] exist. samples are frequently medium to large.
