25|$|Smith is also {{responsible}} {{for the majority of}} the band's lyrics, which are written in a cryptic fractured form of English alternately hailed as poetic or nonsensical. He has generally refused to discuss their content, preferring to keep the words and their inspirations shrouded in mystique and allowing for fan interpretations. Smith has also sometimes employed a cut-up lyrical approach drawing on the works of (among others), William Blake, Charles Kingsley, William Shakespeare and T.S. Eliot. Two favourite cut-and-paste sources are Pedro Carolino’s English As She Is Spoke (a failed Victorian English-Portuguese phrasebook once hailed by Mark Twain as <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> absurdity) and the nineteenth-century Irish poet George Darley. Fans have also spotted references to the films The Night of the Hunter and Eraserhead in Smith's words and music videos.|$|E
25|$|As {{one of the}} World's {{great powers}} {{together}} with Great Britain, France did not only exercise its influence by conquest {{but also by the}} prestige of its military. At the height of European colonial expansion in the 19th century, France's army and Britain's navy were each regarded as the most powerful forces ever on land and at sea. This lead many a military to copy both powers' military and naval cultures. As most navies in the World adopted the British naval looks (double-breasted navy blue jacket and peaked cap for officer, blue jean collar for ratings, etc.), numerous land armies adopted French-inspired uniforms during the 1860s and 1870s (both Union and Confederate armies during the American Civil War, the Chilean Army of the War of the Pacific, the Russian Imperial Army, etc.) and even sometimes imported types of French units (e.g. Zouave regiments). France's influence on military fashion dimmed for the time being after the most unexpected French defeat ending the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871 and many armies then changed to adopt Prussian military style (as <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> this trend, Chilean soldiers traded their kepis for pickelhauben).|$|E
25|$|Now the {{unexpected}} number one {{contender for the}} heavyweight crown held by Jim Braddock, Schmeling looked forward to his chance to regain the title as first Heavyweight ever, scheduled for that September. The fight was postponed, however, when Braddock injured his hand in training. Rumors existed that the fight's organizers were stalling, afraid of the negative publicity that would be generated over a perceived Nazi getting {{a shot at the}} world's title. When it was confirmed that Braddock's managers were in talks with the Louis camp, the New York Commission officially released an order for Braddock to fight Schmeling for the title. Any other fight, with Louis or otherwise, would not be recognized by New York as being for the championship. The Madison Square Garden Corporation, the largest promotional company in the sport at the time, even attempted to get a legal injunction against a Braddock-Louis fight (Louis was not on their roster). Nonetheless, in February 1937, Schmeling received the news that the champion had indeed signed to defend his championship against Louis. A furious Schmeling protested, but to no avail, and he was forced to watch from ringside as Louis knocked Braddock out and gained the championship. Sorely disappointed and convinced that he would never receive his chance at redemption, Schmeling fought just once more in America, an eighth-round knockout of future contender Harry Thomas, before returning to Germany. In his native land, Schmeling was regarded as a hero and promoted by the Nazi propaganda machine as <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> German supremacy over {{the rest of the world}} by virtue of his defeat of the current champion, Louis. The government ordered parades and rallies in his honor. He became a friend to Hitler and other powerful figures in the government and also a popular subject of newspaper articles and films. He continued to press for a chance at a rematch with Louis and in the meantime padded his record against overmatched fighters Ben Foord and Steve Dudas.|$|E

[...] Gravemind, operating as a frenemy, served to personify the Master Chief's otherwise nebulous fight against the Flood.

IGN critic Andy Patrizio considered [...] "The Revenge" [...] one of his personal favorites of season two. The scene in which Kramer struggles to put cement {{in one of the}} washing machines has gained positive responses from critics. Margery Eagan of The Boston Globe cited the scene as <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> Kramer's personality.

40|$|System Dynamics {{has already}} proved useful in {{modeling}} various social phenomena and processes. <b>As</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> such processes, we can mention elections which are effected by many different social, economic, and political factors in every country. Often those factors are so interrelated and the pre-elections situations are so complicated {{that even the}} best political analysts not only cannot predict which party would win the competition, but also, after the elections, are unable to fully explain what factors contributed the most to one party’s success in the elections. In this paper, we turn our attention to Iran’s presidential elections held in 1997 whose outcome was unpredictable even {{a few weeks before}} the elections day. Few people could believe the result of the elections, yet many politicians, analysts, economists, and sociologists tried to describe the sequence of occurrences that led to such a huge win for the Reformists party. Among all the explanations proposed by different people, we focus on a sociological analysis which considers various important factors in Iranian society. The high compatibility of the results of our model’s simulation with what happened in reality shows the great help that modeling can provide us in understanding social happenings...|$|R

Cohen noted that Bender's addiction is <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> something they could do with a robot character which they could not get away with had it been a human character. One person at the studio refused to work on this episode because they did not agree with the portrayal of some of the religious content.
