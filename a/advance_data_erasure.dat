50|$|Permanent <b>data</b> <b>erasure</b> {{goes beyond}} basic file {{deletion}} commands, which only remove direct pointers {{to the data}} disk sectors and make the data recovery possible with common software tools. Unlike degaussing and physical destruction, which render the storage media unusable, <b>data</b> <b>erasure</b> removes all information while leaving the disk operable. New flash memory - based media implementations, such as solid-state drives or USB flash drives can cause <b>data</b> <b>erasure</b> techniques to fail allowing remnant data to be recoverable.|$|R

50|$|To {{protect the}} data on lost or stolen media, some <b>data</b> <b>erasure</b> {{applications}} remotely destroy the data if the password is incorrectly entered. <b>Data</b> <b>erasure</b> tools can also target specific data on a disk for routine erasure, providing a hacking protection method that is less time-consuming than software encryption. Hardware/firmware encryption built into the drive itself or integrated controllers is a popular solution with no degradation in performance at all.|$|R
50|$|While {{there are}} many {{overwriting}} programs, only those capable of complete <b>data</b> <b>erasure</b> offer full security by destroying the data on all areas of a hard drive. Disk overwriting programs that cannot access the entire hard drive, including hidden/locked areas like the host protected area (HPA), device configuration overlay (DCO), and remapped sectors, perform an incomplete erasure, leaving some of the data intact. By accessing the entire hard drive, <b>data</b> <b>erasure</b> eliminates the risk of data remanence.|$|R

However, the complete <b>data</b> <b>erasure</b> from recorded media is also important for the security of the <b>data.</b> After <b>erasure</b> of <b>data</b> from optical disks, recycling the material is needed in order to recover the valuable components of the optical disks. Here, <b>data</b> <b>erasure</b> methods for optical disks are discussed in the view of material recycling.

50|$|<b>Data</b> <b>erasure</b> may {{not work}} {{completely}} on flash based media, such as Solid State Drives and USB Flash Drives, as these devices can store remnant data which is inaccessible to the <b>erasure</b> technique, and <b>data</b> can be retrieved from the individual flash memory chips inside the device.Data erasure through overwriting only works on hard drives that are functioning and writing to all sectors. Bad sectors cannot usually be overwritten, but may contain recoverable information. Bad sectors, however, may be invisible to the host system and thus to the erasing software. Disk encryption before use prevents this problem. Software-driven <b>data</b> <b>erasure</b> could also be compromised by malicious code.|$|R

50|$|Disk {{cleaners}} {{must not}} be mistaken with antivirus software (which delete malware), registry cleaners (which clean Windows Registry) or <b>data</b> <b>erasure</b> software (which securely delete files), although multifunction software (such as those included below) may fit into all these categories.|$|R
50|$|<b>Data</b> <b>erasure</b> can be {{deployed}} over a network to target multiple PCs {{rather than having}} to erase each one sequentially. In contrast with DOS-based overwriting programs that may not detect all network hardware, Linux-based <b>data</b> <b>erasure</b> software supports high-end server and storage area network (SAN) environments with hardware support for Serial ATA, Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) and Fibre Channel disks and remapped sectors. It operates directly with sector sizes such as 520, 524, and 528, removing the need to first reformat back to 512 sector size. Win PE has now overtaken linux as the environment of choice since drivers can be added with little effort. This also helps with data destruction of tablets and other handheld devices that require pure UEFI environments with out hardware NIC's installed and/or are lacking UEFI network stack support.|$|R

50|$|<b>Data</b> <b>erasure</b> {{can also}} bypass the BIOS and OS.

50|$|Increased {{storage of}} {{sensitive}} data, combined with rapid technological {{change and the}} shorter lifespan of IT assets, has driven the need for permanent <b>data</b> <b>erasure</b> of electronic devices as they are retired or refurbished. Also, compromised networks and laptop theft and loss, {{as well as that}} of other portable media, are increasingly common sources of data breaches.|$|R
50|$|When {{encryption}} is in place, <b>data</b> <b>erasure</b> acts as {{a complement}} to Crypto-shredding, or the practice of 'deleting' data by (only) deleting or overwriting the encryption keys. Presently, dedicated hardware/firmware encryption solutions can perform a 256-bit full AES encryption faster than the drive electronics can write the data. Drives with this capability are known as self-encrypting drives (SEDs); they are present on most modern enterprise-level laptops and are increasingly used in the enterprise to protect the data. Changing the encryption key renders inaccessible all data stored on a SED, which is an easy and very fast method for achieving a 100% <b>data</b> <b>erasure.</b> Theft of an SED results in a physical asset loss, but the stored data is inaccessible without the decryption key that is not stored on a SED, assuming there are no effective attacks against AES or its implementation in the drive hardware.|$|R

50|$|<b>Data</b> <b>erasure</b> {{offers an}} {{alternative}} to physical destruction and degaussing for secure removal of all the disk data. Physical destruction and degaussing destroy the digital media, requiring disposal and contributing to electronic waste while negatively impacting the carbon footprint of individuals and companies.

50|$|Many {{government}} and industry standards exist for software-based overwriting that removes the data. A key factor in meeting these standards {{is the number of}} times the data is overwritten. Also, some standards require a method to verify that all the data have been removed from the entire hard drive and to view the overwrite pattern. Complete <b>data</b> <b>erasure</b> should account for hidden areas, typically DCO, HPA and remapped sectors.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Data</b> <b>erasure</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to as data clearing or data wiping) is a software-based method of overwriting the data that aims to completely destroy all electronic data residing on a hard disk drive or other digital media by using zeros and ones to overwrite data onto all sectors of the device. By overwriting the data on the storage device, the data is rendered unrecoverable and achieves data sanitization.|$|R
