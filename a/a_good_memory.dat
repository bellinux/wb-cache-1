5|$|The promotional {{phase of}} the {{gameplay}} mainly deals with the idol conversing with various other characters and doing events, {{some of which are}} necessary to progress the game. There are also times when the player is given choices that directly affect the idol. Over the course of a conversation, text progression pauses when the player is given multiple responses to choose from. Depending on which choice is made will effect how well or poorly the communication is received, which results in either bad, normal or good memories. A bad memory will decrease an idol's enthusiasm, which is displayed at certain points throughout gameplay by a horizontal bar in the top-left of the lower screen. An idol's enthusiasm ranges from blue to yellow and finally to red as enthusiasm increases. A normal memory will reward the player with a heart point, used later during auditions. <b>A</b> <b>good</b> <b>memory</b> will reward the player with two heart points and increased enthusiasm. If the player chooses to take the day off, an idol's enthusiasm will automatically increase. Days off also give the idol the chance to either stay at home, or go out into town and meet with other characters. The player can check on days off if there are any presents fans have sent the idols, which contain in-game items.|$|E

Charles claims he was a direct descendant of Jacques de L'Orme, {{one of those who}} worked on the reform of the Custom of Bourbonnais.|$|E
25|$|In Müllerian mimicry an {{advantage}} is gained when unpalatable species resemble each other, {{especially when the}} predator has <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>memory</b> for colour (as birds, for instance, do have). Thus one trial may work to dissuade a bird from several species of butterfly which all fly the same 'flag'. Brazilian butterflies provide {{some of the most}} extraordinary examples of mimicry, and Müller, Bates and Wallace all had lengthy experience of this. All three traveller-naturalists believed firmly that such systems of mimicry could only come about by means of natural selection, and all of them wrote about it.|$|E

500|$|Edwards {{was born}} in Fremantle, Western Australia, on 1 August 1914, the third of five {{children}} to Welsh parents Hugh, a blacksmith and farrier, and his wife Jane (née Watkins), who had emigrated to Australia in 1909. Named after his father, he was always referred to by his middle name of Idwal in his family. Edwards received his initial education at White Gum Valley School, before attending the Fremantle Boy's School where he achieved well academically, although he later claimed {{this was due to}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>memory</b> rather than high intelligence. However, Edwards was reluctantly forced to leave school at the age of fourteen as the family finances could no longer support him. Described as a [...] "shy, under-confident, introspective and imaginative lad" [...] at this stage in his life, he gained employment as a shipping office clerk.|$|E
500|$|The {{ambulance}} carrying McKinley {{reached the}} Exposition hospital at 4:25p.m. [...] Although it usually dealt {{only with the}} minor medical issues of fairgoers, the hospital did have an operating theatre. [...] At {{the time of the}} shooting, no fully qualified doctor was at the hospital, only nurses and interns. [...] The best surgeon in the city, and the Exposition's medical director, Dr. Roswell Park, was in Niagara Falls, performing a delicate neck operation. [...] When interrupted during the procedure on September 6 to be told he was needed in Buffalo, he responded that he could not leave, even for the President of the United States. [...] He was then told who had been shot. [...] Park, two weeks later, would save the life of a woman who suffered injuries almost identical to McKinley's. [...] The first physician to arrive at the hospital was Dr. Herman Mynter, whom the President had met briefly the previous day; the wounded McKinley (who had <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>memory</b> for faces) joked that when he had met Mynter, he had not expected to need his professional services. [...] As McKinley lay on the operating table, he stated of Czolgosz, [...] "He didn't know, poor fellow, what he was doing. [...] He couldn't have known." [...] With Park unavailable and with the fading afternoon light the major source of illumination in the operating room, when another surgeon, Dr. Matthew D. Mann arrived, {{the decision was made to}} operate at once to try to remove the remaining bullet. [...] Mynter had given McKinley an injection of morphine and strychnine to ease his pain; Mann (a noted gynecologist without experience in abdominal wounds) administered ether to sedate McKinley as the wounded man murmured the Lord's Prayer.|$|E

[...] However, Darrach wrote, [...] "McClellan had his peculiarities." [...] He often came across as disrespectful and even insubordinate and spoke in a [...] "rapid incoherent manner."

2500|$|But most {{importantly}} despite {{the abundance of}} reforms during the two controversial reigns Ivan Saltykov managed to create the structures of city government and compile the city budget. In 1804 he resigned of his own will, leaving <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>memory.</b> That is how Ivan Saltykov is characterized in the book “Biographies of the Russian Generalissimos and the General Field Marshalls” published in 1840: “Having never made anyone miserable in his whole life, Count Ivan Saltykov was a stranger to shameful pride and despised nobody but arrogant timeservers; he was a cordial host and led a lush life in Moscow: lunches and dinners for 60 persons were served in his house every single day; each Sunday a crowd of 100 guests would come to his ball…He tried to eradicate extortion in government offices, established order and decency, was universally loved and respected and enjoyed bringing good to people. [...] His spare time he spent out in the fields with his huntsmen that he had about a hundred; his son inherited sixteen thousand peasants as well as twelve hundred house serfs and a debt of two million eight thousand”.|$|E
2500|$|The tarsier, {{especially}} if it's a male, {{is also a}} territorial creature. A male would attack any young tarsier venturing into its territory and kill it with a fierce bite. [...] "That's why when there's a newborn, we try {{to check on the}} position [...] three times a day," [...] he said, adding that the male tarsier's murderous disposition precluded keeping it in a small, enclosed space. The creatures seem to have <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>memory,</b> too. [...] "Because whenever there are guests, that's when their eyes stay wide open. If it's just me around, they give me a brief look and go back to sleep," [...] he said. The tarsier mainly dines on insects, usually crickets, and frogs. Its chief predator, on the other hand, is the common house cat. The estimated 100 tarsiers in the PTFI sanctuary can climb over the surrounding seven-foot-high net fence to hunt elsewhere at night. But they almost always return before daybreak. The fence is actually more for keeping the cats out and the insects in, Pizarras explained. Thus, he and two other staff members have made it their daily morning routine to inspect the net for breaches. At night, with the help of strong fog lights, flying insects from neighboring hills are drawn to the sanctuary, providing the tarsiers a steady menu.|$|E
2500|$|Midwifery in Greco-Roman antiquity {{covered a}} wide range of women, {{including}} old women who continued folk medical traditions in the villages of the Roman Empire, trained midwives who garnered their knowledge from a variety of sources, and highly trained women who were considered female physicians. However, there were certain characteristics desired in a “good” midwife, as described by the physician Soranus of Ephesus in the 2nd century. He states in his work, Gynecology, that “a suitable person will be literate, with her wits about her, possessed of <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>memory,</b> loving work, respectable and generally not unduly handicapped as regards her senses , sound of limb, robust, and, according to some people, endowed with long slim fingers and short nails at her fingertips.” Soranus also recommends that the midwife be of sympathetic disposition (although she need not have borne a child herself) and that she keep her hands soft for the comfort of both mother and child. Pliny, another physician from this time, valued nobility and a quiet and inconspicuous disposition in a midwife. [...] There appears to have been three “grades” of midwives present: [...] The first was technically proficient; the second may have read some of the texts on obstetrics and gynecology; but the third was highly trained and reasonably considered a medical specialist with a concentration in midwifery.|$|E
