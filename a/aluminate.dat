5|$|Cobalt is {{primarily}} {{used in the}} preparation of magnetic, wear-resistant and high-strength alloys. The compounds, cobalt silicate and cobalt(II) <b>aluminate</b> (CoAl2O4, cobalt blue) give a distinctive deep blue color to glass, ceramics, inks, paints and varnishes. Cobalt occurs naturally as only one stable isotope, cobalt-59. Cobalt-60 is a commercially important radioisotope, used as a radioactive tracer and for the production of high energy gamma rays.|$|E
5|$|Before the 19th century, cobalt was {{predominantly}} {{used as a}} pigment. Since the Middle Ages, it {{has been}} used in the production of smalt, a blue colored glass. Smalt is produced by melting a mixture of the roasted mineral smaltite, quartz and potassium carbonate, yielding a dark blue silicate glass which is finely ground after the production. Smalt was widely used for the coloration of glass and as pigment for paintings. In 1780, Sven Rinman discovered cobalt green, and in 1802 Louis Jacques Thénard discovered cobalt blue. Cobalt pigments such as cobalt blue (cobalt <b>aluminate),</b> cerulean blue (cobalt(II) stannate), various hues of cobalt green (a mixture of cobalt(II) oxide and zinc oxide), and cobalt violet (cobalt phosphate) are used as artist's pigments because of their superior chromatic stability. Aureolin (cobalt yellow) is now largely replaced by more lightfast yellow pigments.|$|E
5|$|The largest use {{of calcium}} is in steelmaking, {{due to its}} strong {{chemical}} affinity for oxygen and sulfur. Its oxides and sulfides, once formed, give liquid lime <b>aluminate</b> and sulfide inclusions in steel which float out; on treatment, these inclusions disperse throughout the steel and became small and spherical, improving castability, cleanliness and general mechanical properties. Calcium is also used in maintenance-free automotive batteries, in which the use of 0.1% calcium–lead alloys {{instead of the usual}} antimony–lead alloys leads to lower water loss and lower self-discharging. Due to the risk of expansion and cracking, aluminium is sometimes also incorporated into these alloys. These lead–calcium alloys are also used in casting, replacing lead–antimony alloys. Calcium is also used to strengthen aluminium alloys used for bearings, for the control of graphitic carbon in cast iron, and to remove bismuth impurities from lead. Calcium metal is found in some drain cleaners, where it functions to generate heat and calcium hydroxide that saponifies the fats and liquefies the proteins (for example, those in hair) that block drains. Besides metallurgy, the reactivity of calcium is exploited to remove nitrogen from high-purity argon gas and as a getter for oxygen and nitrogen. It is also used as a reducing agent in the production of chromium, zirconium, thorium, and uranium. It {{can also be used to}} store hydrogen gas, as it reacts with hydrogen to form solid calcium hydride, from which the hydrogen can easily be re-extracted.|$|E

30|$|<b>Aluminated</b> {{mesoporous}} silica was prepared by multiple post-grafting of alumina onto uniform mesoporous SiO 2, which was assembled from monodisperse SiO 2 microspheres. Hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalyst was prepared by loading Ni and Mo active components onto the <b>aluminated</b> uniform mesoporous SiO 2, and its HDS catalytic performance was evaluated using hydrodesulfurization of dibenzothiophene as the probe reaction at 300  °C and 6.0  MPa in a tubular reactor. The samples {{were characterized by}} N 2 physisorption, scanning electronic microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrum, X-ray diffraction (XRD), temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH 3 -TPD), 27 Al nuclear magnetic resonance (27 Al-NMR) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The {{results showed that the}} Si–OH group content of SiO 2 was mainly dependent on the pretreatment conditions and had significant influence on the activity of the NiMo catalyst. The surface properties of the <b>aluminated</b> SiO 2 varied with the Al 2 O 3 -grafting cycles. Generally after four cycles of grafting, the <b>aluminated</b> SiO 2 behaved like amorphous alumina. In addition, plotting of activity of NiMo catalysts supported on <b>aluminated</b> meso–macroporous silica materials against the Al 2 O 3 -grafting cycle yields a volcano curve.|$|R

They are ferromagnetic, progressively more so as iron content increases. These phases are easily prepared from the oxides.|$|E
25|$|Calcium aluminoferrite {{has little}} effect upon the {{physical}} properties of cement. On hydration it forms 4CaO⋅Al2O3⋅nH2O and hydrated iron oxide gel. In principle, {{this is a}} fast and energetic reaction, but precipitation of an insoluble layer of hydrated iron oxide upon the calcium aluminoferrite crystal surface forms a barrier to further reaction. In the case of Portland cement, subsequent slow reaction with dissolved sulfate forms an AFm phase, which has negligible strength-giving properties. In the case of calcium <b>aluminate</b> cements, the situation is less clear-cut, {{but there is little}} contribution to early strength. Calcium aluminoferrite is also present in sulfoaluminate cements, and again contributes no strength.|$|E
25|$|Aluminium, {{like its}} {{congener}} boron, is less electronegative than carbon (Al, 1.61; C, 2.55); thus, aluminium-bound carbons in organoalanes possess partial negative charge and are nucleophilic as a result. Generally, however, organoalanes are not nucleophilic enough to transfer an organic group {{on their own}} (the exception being when carbonyl and enone acceptors are used, due to the high oxophilicity of aluminium). In most cases, nucleophilic activation of organoalanes is necessary for group transfer to take place. Like organoboranes, organoalanes possess an empty p orbital on the aluminium center that can receive electron density from an added nucleophile. The resulting negatively charged <b>aluminate</b> is much more nucleophilic than the neutral alane.|$|E

25|$|Strong bases attack aluminium. Sodium {{hydroxide}} {{reacts with}} aluminium {{and water to}} release hydrogen gas. The aluminium takes the oxygen atom from sodium hydroxide, which in turn takes the oxygen atom from the water, and releases the two hydrogen atoms, The reaction thus produces hydrogen gas and sodium <b>aluminate.</b> In this reaction, sodium hydroxide acts as an agent to make the solution alkaline, which aluminium can dissolve in. This reaction {{can be useful in}} etching, removing anodizing, or converting a polished surface to a satin-like finish, but without further passivation such as anodizing or alodining the surface may become degraded, either under normal use or in severe atmospheric conditions.|$|E

When cryolite is used for {{the preparation}} of alum, it is mixed with calcium carbonate and heated. By this means, sodium <b>aluminate</b> is formed; it is then extracted with water and precipitated either by sodium bicarbonate or by passing a current of carbon dioxide through the solution. The precipitate is then dissolved in sulfuric acid, the requisite amount of potassium sulfate added and the solution allowed to crystallize.|$|E

Europium oxide (Eu2O3) is widely used as a red phosphor in television sets and fluorescent lamps, and as an activator for yttrium-based phosphors. Color TV screens contain between 0.5 and 1g of europium oxide. Whereas trivalent europium gives red phosphors, the luminescence of divalent europium depends strongly on {{the composition of the}} host structure. UV to deep red luminescence can be achieved. The two classes of europium-based phosphor (red and blue), combined with the yellow/green terbium phosphors give [...] "white" [...] light, the color temperature of which can be varied by altering the proportion or specific composition of the individual phosphors. This phosphor system is typically encountered in helical fluorescent light bulbs. Combining the same three classes is one way to make trichromatic systems in TV and computer screens. Europium is also used in the manufacture of fluorescent glass. One of the more common persistent after-glow phosphors besides copper-doped zinc sulfide is europium-doped strontium <b>aluminate.</b> Europium fluorescence is used to interrogate biomolecular interactions in drug-discovery screens.
