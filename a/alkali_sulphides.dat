40|$|During the {{interaction}} of sulphide minerals with the environment many reactions may occur. The knowledge of sulphur chemical state is important in order to clarify the mechanisms of oxidation/dissolution and precipitation reactions also in biotic conditions {{on the surface of}} these minerals. To date different hypotheses have been proposed for identifying the sulphur compounds that may form but no consensus is reached so far because the identification has been carried out either only {{on the basis of the}} photoelectron signals or combining the photoelectron signal with the centroid of the X-ray induced SKLL Auger line. The objectives of this thesis are: the development of an analytical strategy for the unambiguous identification of sulphur chemical state in nanometer thick layers that form on mineral surfaces after leaching. To this purpose the acquisition of detailed spectra of a series of metal sulphides and of model systems made of mixtures of sulphur and polysulphides prepared under controlled conditions is necessary. Second objective was the establishment of the curve-fitting procedure to allow the separation of the different components present on the surface (sulphide, polysulphides, sulphates) not only of the S 2 p XP-spectra but also of the SKLL spectra. Based on these results the Auger parameter values will be determined and will be used together with the chemical state plot to distinguish the chemical state of sulphur species formed on the mineral surfaces after different surface treatments. In this way, the surface reactivity of sulphide minerals and more in general, of sulphur –bearing particles will be determined The present work is organized in six chapters: the first one presents a short overview on the environmental problems that may occur when sulphide minerals, especially, those bearing eco-toxic elements such as arsenic, are exposed to the acidic mine drainage in the presence of oxidants and/or of microorganisms which enhance oxidation kinetics. It then outlines the analytical strategy that was adopted in this work for the identification of the sulphur chemical state. In the second chapter a literature survey is provided: it underlines the role of sulphur in sulphide bearing minerals: Section 2. 1 reports information about the mineral enargite and the chemical state of sulphur on its surface as it is available to date. Section 2. 2 deals with the literature on the possibility of using the KLL Auger transition. In chapter 3 a brief description of X-ray photoelectron and X-ray excited Auger electron spectroscopy is given while the materials and methods used in the present work are presented in chapter 4. In chapter 5 – results and discussion - the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray excited Auger electron spectroscopy (XAES) analyses on alkaline and transition metal sulphide and sulphates, polysulphides and sulphide minerals are presented. In particular the spectra recorded on the S 2 p and S KLL lines of the sulphides and sulphates are shown: they were collected for getting the peak fitting parameters and apply them to the model systems obtained by mixing sulphur with sodium tetrasulphide and to investigate the composition of mineral surfaces. Minerals were analysed freshly cleaved, ground and after air exposure. The chemical state of sulphur in sulphates, sulphides (alkali- and transition metal compounds, minerals) and polysulphide is then discussed. For the first time the X-ray excited Auger SKLL lines were fitted with parameters based on standards. In this way, which can be considered as an extension of previous work, a separation of the different components and a more precise determination of their kinetic energy were achieved. The Auger parameter and the chemical state plot were obtained by combining the S 2 p photoelectron lines and the SKLL Auger lines. On this basis a clear distinction of the chemical state of sulphur in sulphates, in <b>alkali</b> <b>sulphides</b> and in transition metal sulphides was possible. The chemical state of sulphur in the bulk of minerals such as enargite or pyrite was determined. The chemical state of sulphur that formed on the surface of compounds after exposure to air or after grinding was found to vary according the coordinating metal and its concentration. It can be assessed that the analytical approach developed in the presented thesis and based on the curve – fitting procedure applied to the X-ray induced Auger electron spectroscopy appears to be a very promising method for identifying the chemical state of sulphur and for providing a new insight in the surface chemistry of sulphide minerals...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{elemental}} and phase compositions of cornstalk ash {{are largely}} {{different from that}} of lean coal ash. In comparison with pure lean coal, co-firing of cornstalk and lean coal may result in serious corrosion to the heating surface of superheater. This paper presents a composition comparison between the two ashes by means of Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS) analysis and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis. A number of experiments were carried out in a tubular furnace to investigate the ash corrosion characteristics. Measured corrosion characteristic curves show the agreement of parabolic rule, and the corrosion is mainly effected by ash compositions and temperature. It was also found that alkali-chloride, <b>alkali</b> metal <b>sulphide</b> in ash and HCl in flue gas significantly aggravate the corrosion. The corrosion speed increases as the temperature increase, and becomes significantly high when the temperature is above 550 ℃...|$|R

40|$|The mineralogical data materialized in {{the present}} work suggest that the {{previously}} described skarns at Ad Darb in the literature are actually marble deposits intercalated with schists and phyllites of different compositions. The marble and associated metasediments lie {{to the west of}} striking ridges of marbles that are nearly aligned in the NNW-SSE direction. Garnet at Al Madhiq occurrence often occurs in the form of bands conformable with rock foliation (gneissosity and schistosity). It is suggested that the paragenesis “quartz-gar- net-epidote” is developed due to the percolation of some Al-rich solutions along rock foliation of the horn- blende gneiss, i. e. metasomatic garnet. Careful field investigation collaborated with petrographic and SEM studies, suggest the occurrence of another garnetiferous paragenesis associating quartz, mica and feldspar in pegmatites, aplites and quartz veins, i. e. exclusively igneous garnet. Metasomatic garnet in the calc-silicates of Al Madhiq is of grossular composition. It is commonly unzoned but some distinctly to slightly zoned crystals are observed where the core is andradite-rich and the rim is grossular. Metasomatic events responseble for growth of garnet in the calc-silicates led also to formation of epidote post-dating grossular. Hand specimens, microscopic investigation and BSE images prove that this epidote post-dates and replaces gros sular, and even rims it in some instances. Igneous garnet at Al Madhiq (almandine-spessartine) is found only in pegmatites and aplites that are genetically related to <b>alkali</b> granitoids. <b>Sulphides</b> (dominated by pyrite) occur in intemate association with domains rich in grossular and hence these sulphides are more likely hydrothermal indicating reducing conditions for formation of grossular...|$|R
