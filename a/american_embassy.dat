The protests were most prevalent in the US, but on 17 March, several thousand demonstrators marched to the <b>American</b> <b>embassy</b> in London's Grosvenor Square and violently clashed with police. Major protests concerning other political issues made international news, such as the March 1968 protests in Poland against their communist government, and the campus uprisings of May 1968 in France.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of an}} American unified special {{operations}} command had its origins {{in the aftermath of}} Operation Eagle Claw, the disastrous attempted rescue of hostages at the <b>American</b> <b>embassy</b> in Iran in 1980. The ensuing investigation, chaired by Admiral James L.

5|$|At the time, Ngô Đình Nhu {{was known}} to favor an even harder line against the Buddhists. Nhu was the younger brother of President Diệm and his main confidant, and was {{regarded}} as the real power behind the Ngô family's rule. Nhu had made statements calling for {{the suppression of the}} protests through his English-language newspaper, the Times of Vietnam. There were persistent reports that Nhu was seeking to usurp power from his elder brother and to attack the Buddhists. Nick Turner of Reuters approached Nhu and interviewed him about these rumors. Nhu said that if the Buddhist crisis were not resolved, he would stage a coup, demolish Xá Lợi in two hours, and head a new anti-Buddhist government. The news was promptly published, which the <b>American</b> <b>embassy</b> largely disregarded, purportedly unconvinced as to Nhu's seriousness.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the <b>American</b> <b>embassy</b> {{believed}} the Ngô family's {{claims that the}} regular army {{was responsible for the}} raids. The Voice of America, which was widely listened to in South Vietnam as the only non-Diệmist news source, initially aired Nhu's version of events, much to the dismay of the generals. The American media thought otherwise and began to debunk this theory, pointing out that the Ngô family constantly sought to undermine the army, and that Madame Nhu's joy over the events suggested the family had neither ceded power nor had their hands forced by the military. Furthermore, they identified Nhu's aides at the site, his idiosyncratic style in the announcements supposedly made by the ARVN, {{and the fact that the}} army had little motive to attack the Buddhists.|$|E

Service praised the CPC and compared them to European socialists, rather than the feared U.S.S.R. Service credited the CPC for a clean and superior society {{in stark contrast to the}} corruption and chaos he saw in the Nationalist areas controlled by Chiang Kai-shek. He was found bias. After visiting Yan'an, Service advocated that the United States should work with the forces opposed to the Nationalists, such as the Communists, though he did not advocate abandoning Chiang.

In January 1957, Häyhänen received a message from Moscow promoting him to Lieutenant Colonel and granting him leave in the Soviet Union. Upon hearing he was due to return to Moscow, Häyhänen was fearful {{that he would be}} severely disciplined or even executed. Häyhänen fabricated stories to justify his delay, claiming to Fisher that the FBI had taken him off the RMS Queen Mary. Fisher, unsuspecting, advised Häyhänen to leave the U.S. immediately to avoid FBI surveillance and handed him two hundred dollars for travel expenses. Prior to his departure, Häyhänen returned to Bear Mountain Park and retrieved the buried five thousand dollars for his own use. Häyhänen arrived in Paris on May Day, having sailed from the U.S. aboard La Liberté. Making contact with the KGB residency he received another two hundred dollars for his journey to Moscow.
