Set between 1967 and 1997, the film depicts {{the relationship between the}} child murderer and Lord Longford, the politician who spent years campaigning (ultimately unsuccessfully) for her release. Longford was a critical success and premiered with 1.7 million viewers. Morton, however, was severely criticised by the relatives of the children who were killed by Hindley and Ian Brady, but she insisted, [...] "It is my duty as a performer to raise issues...we're <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at". She received a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards, and won at the 65th Golden Globe Awards.|$|E

"I don't {{want to be}} offensive; but can't you {{see that}} by urging me to let the thing drop you are casting grave doubts upon the honor of a man of your own caste and kind, one with whom you are closely acquainted?

50|$|As Sado grew older, his {{pervasive}} {{fear and}} anger {{spread to other}} parts of his life. Although unknown to Lady Hyegyong, courtroom scripts of King Yongjo and Crown Prince Sado’s interactions revealed Yongjo scolding Sado that “thunder on the previous night was a warning that Sado should develop moral virtue” (Heritage 173). Afterwards, Lady Hyegyong describes Sado becoming so afraid of thunder he would lie on the ground until the storm was over (Haboush, “Memoirs” p. 265). She also claims Sado’s fear grew so intense he became too <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> even <b>look</b> at the character for thunder (Haboush, “Memoirs” p. 265). Sado also developed a phobia of clothing that required him to burn clothing as part of a ritual (Haboush, “Memoirs” p. 289).|$|R
2500|$|Diaghilev {{was known}} as a hard, demanding, even {{frightening}} taskmaster. Ninette de Valois, no shrinking violet, said she was too <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> ever <b>look</b> him in the face. George Balanchine said he carried around a cane during rehearsals, and banged it angrily when he was displeased. Other dancers said he would shoot them down with one look, or a cold comment. On the other hand, he was capable of great kindness, and when stranded with his bankrupt company in Spain during the 1914–18 war, gave his last bit of cash to Lydia Sokolova to buy medical care for her daughter. Alicia Markova was very young when she joined the Ballet Russes and would later say that she had called Diaghilev [...] "Sergypops" [...] and he had said he would take care of her like a daughter.|$|R

60|$|Pan stood {{gazing down}} the green aisle. He had acted true to himself. How {{impossible}} {{to meet this}} situation in any other way! It meant the spilling of blood. He knew it--accepted it--and {{made no attempt to}} change the cold passion deep within him. Lucy--his mother and father would suffer. But wouldn't they suffer more if he did not confront this conflict as his hard training dictated? He was almost <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> turn and <b>look</b> at Lucy. Just a little while before he had promised her forbearance. So his amaze was great when she faced him, violet eyes ablaze, to clasp him, and creep close to him, with lingering traces of fear giving way to woman's admiration and love.|$|R

60|$|She {{glanced at}} him a moment, and was <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> again. The man's face was very grim, but she had seen what was in his eyes, and waited almost breathless, until he stooped and laid his hand upon her shoulder.|$|E
60|$|I state, Sir, these particulars, {{because this}} act of spirit and fortitude has lately been, in the {{circulation}} of the season, and in some hazarded declamations in this House, attributed to timidity. If, Sir, the conduct of ministry, in proposing the repeal, had arisen from timidity with regard to themselves, {{it would have been}} greatly to be condemned. Interested timidity disgraces as much in the cabinet as personal timidity does in the field. But timidity with regard to the well-being of our country is heroic virtue. The noble lord who then conducted affairs, and his worthy colleagues, whilst they trembled at the prospect of such distresses as you have since brought upon yourselves, were not <b>afraid</b> steadily <b>to</b> <b>look</b> in the face that glaring and dazzling influence at which the eyes of eagles have blenched. He looked in the face one of the ablest, and, let me say, not the most scrupulous oppositions, that perhaps ever was in this House; and withstood it, unaided by even one of the usual supports of administration. He did this, when he repealed the Stamp Act. He looked in the face a person he had long respected and regarded, and whose aid was then particularly wanting: I mean Lord Chatham. He did this when he passed the Declaratory Act.|$|R
