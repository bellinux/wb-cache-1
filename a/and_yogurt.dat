5|$|The {{largest number}} {{exist in the}} gut flora, {{and a large number}} on the skin. The vast {{majority}} of the bacteria in the body are rendered harmless by the protective effects of the immune system, though many are beneficial particularly in the gut flora. However several species of bacteria are pathogenic and cause infectious diseases, including cholera, syphilis, anthrax, leprosy, and bubonic plague. The most common fatal bacterial diseases are respiratory infections, with tuberculosis alone killing about 2 million people per year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. In developed countries, antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are also used in farming, making antibiotic resistance a growing problem. In industry, bacteria are important in sewage treatment and the breakdown of oil spills, the production of cheese <b>and</b> <b>yogurt</b> through fermentation, and the recovery of gold, palladium, copper and other metals in the mining sector, as well as in biotechnology, and the manufacture of antibiotics and other chemicals.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to characterize the fatty acids profiles of goat milk and its fermented products i. e. <b>yogurt</b> <b>and</b> concentrated <b>yogurt.</b> Fresh milk from Peranakan Etawah goats was collected directly from local goat farmers, and processed into stirred-type fresh yogurt. The yogurt was then further processed into concentrated yogurt using Berge method. A total of 26 fatty acids were detected in milk, <b>yogurt</b> <b>and</b> concentrated <b>yogurt,</b> comprised of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. The oleic acid, stearic acid and palmitic acid were the major fatty acids found in fresh milk, <b>yogurt</b> <b>and</b> concentrated <b>yogurt.</b> There were changes in the profiles of individual fatty acids during processing of fresh goat milk into <b>yogurt</b> <b>and</b> concentrated <b>yogurt...</b>|$|R

However, it is demonstrated that the ingestion of phytosterols enriched milk <b>and</b> <b>yogurts</b> could reduce cholesterolemia. The purpose of the present work was to assess the commercially available phytosterols-enriched milk <b>and</b> <b>yogurts.</b> As such, the available three milk <b>and</b> seven <b>yogurt</b> presentations in Portuguese market were collected during 2008 and analyzed through gas chromatography coupled with mass detection. All the analyzed milk samples were in agreement with the proportion established by the European Commission, with β-sitosterol as the more abundant phytosterol.

25|$|Mucor plumbeus is {{a fungus}} {{in the family}} Mucoraceae (subphylum Mucoromycotina) that is very common, {{abundant}} and distributed worldwide. Mucor plumbeus is not {{known to be a}} plant or animal pathogen; however it is able to elicit an immune response in humans by activating the complement system. This species is commonly found in various types of soils over a range of pH, although alkaline soils seem more conducive to its growth. It is also known from the roots of wheat, oat and barley. In addition, M.plumbeus is a common fungal contaminant of indoor built environments. This species shares many similarities with M.racemosus, another fungus that belongs to the family Mucoraceae which is known to cause mucormycosis. Mucor plumbeus is a common spoilage agent of cheese, apples, apple cider <b>and</b> <b>yogurt.</b>|$|E

25|$|Indian Chinese cuisine, {{also known}} as Indo-Chinese cuisine {{originated}} in the 19th century among the Chinese community of Calcutta, during the immigration of Hakka Chinese from Canton (present-day Guangzhou) seeking to escape the First and Second Opium Wars and political instability in the region. Upon exposure to local Indian cuisine, they incorporated many spices and cooking techniques into their own cuisine, thus creating a unique fusion of Indian and Chinese cuisine. After 1947, many Cantonese immigrants fleeing political repression under Mao Zedong, opened their own restaurants in Calcutta, whose dishes combined aspects of Indian cuisine with Cantonese cuisine. While Indian Chinese cuisine is heavily derived from traditional Chinese cuisine, it bears little resemblance to its Chinese counterpart. The dishes tend to be flavoured with cumin, coriander seeds, and turmeric, which with a few regional exceptions, are not traditionally associated with Chinese cuisine. Chilli, ginger, garlic <b>and</b> <b>yogurt</b> are also frequently used in dishes.|$|E
25|$|He {{reached the}} port of Chittagong in modern-day Bangladesh {{intending}} to travel to Sylhet to meet Shah Jalal, who became so renowned that Ibn Battuta, then in Chittagong, made a one-month journey through the mountains of Kamaru near Sylhet to meet him. On his way to Sylhet, Ibn Battuta was greeted by several of Shah Jalal's disciples {{who had come to}} assist him on his journey many days before he had arrived. At the meeting in 1345 CE, Ibn Battuta noted that Shah Jalal was tall and lean, fair in complexion and lived by the mosque in a cave, where his only item of value was a goat he kept for milk, butter, <b>and</b> <b>yogurt.</b> He observed that the companions of the Shah Jalal were foreign and known for their strength and bravery.

25|$|Odia cuisine {{refers to}} the cooking of the eastern Indian state of Odisha. Foods from this area are rich and varied, while relying heavily on local ingredients. The {{flavours}} are usually subtle and delicately spiced, quite unlike the fiery curries typically associated with Indian cuisine. Fish and other seafood such as crab and shrimp are very popular. Chicken and mutton are also consumed, but somewhat occasionally. Only 6% {{of the population of}} Odisha is vegetarian, and this is reflected in its cuisine. The oil base used is mostly mustard oil, but in festivals ghee is used. Panch phutana, a mix of cumin, mustard, fennel, fenugreek and kalonji (nigella) is widely used for tempering vegetables and dals, while garam masala (curry powder) and haladi (turmeric) are commonly used for non-vegetarian curries. Pakhala, a dish made of rice, water, <b>and</b> <b>yogurt,</b> that is fermented overnight, is very popular in summer, particularly in the rural areas. Oriyas are very fond of sweets and no Oriya repast is considered complete without some dessert at the end. Festivals and fasts witness a cuisine without onion and garlic, whereas other days witness an aroma of garlic and onion paste in curries. One can find restaurants serving food without onion and garlic in major places like Puri and other coastal area, which is run by Brahmin owners.|$|E

500|$|Though sheep's milk may {{be drunk}} rarely in fresh form, {{today it is}} used {{predominantly}} in cheese <b>and</b> <b>yogurt</b> making. Sheep have only two teats, and produce a far smaller volume of milk than cows. However, as sheep's milk contains far more fat, solids, and minerals than cow's milk, it is ideal for the cheese-making process. It also resists contamination during cooling better because of its much higher calcium content. [...] Well-known cheeses made from sheep milk include the Feta of Bulgaria and Greece, Roquefort of France, Manchego from Spain, the Pecorino Romano (the Italian word for sheep is pecore) and Ricotta of Italy. Yogurts, especially some forms of strained yogurt, may also be made from sheep milk. Many of these products are now often made with cow's milk, especially when produced outside their country of origin. Sheep milk contains 4.8% lactose, which may affect those who are intolerant.|$|E
