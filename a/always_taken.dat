5|$|Like other {{rulers of}} the period, Henry donated to the Church and patronised various {{religious}} communities, but contemporary chroniclers did not consider him an unusually pious king. His personal beliefs and piety may, however, have developed {{during the course of}} his life. Henry had <b>always</b> <b>taken</b> an interest in religion, but in his later years he may have become much more concerned about spiritual affairs. If so, the major shifts in his thinking would appear to have occurred after 1120, when his son William Adelin died, and 1129, when his daughter's marriage teetered on the verge of collapse.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, MacArthur had {{attacked}} the imperial mystique when his staff released the famous {{picture of his}} first meeting with the Emperor, whose impact on the Japanese public was electric as the Japanese people for the first time saw the Emperor as a mere man overshadowed by the much taller MacArthur instead of the living god he had always been portrayed as. Up to 1945, the Emperor had been a remote, mysterious figure to his people, rarely seen in public and always silent, whose photographs were <b>always</b> <b>taken</b> from a certain angle to make him look taller and more impressive than he really was. No Japanese photographer would have taken such a photo of the Emperor being overshadowed by MacArthur. The Japanese government immediately banned the photo of the Emperor with MacArthur {{on the grounds that it}} damaged the imperial mystique, but MacArthur rescinded the ban and ordered all of the Japanese newspapers to print it. The photo was intended as a message to the Emperor about who was going to be the senior partner in their relationship.|$|E

25|$|Many {{restaurants}} and homes in Japan {{are equipped with}} Western-style chairs and tables. However, traditional Japanese low tables and cushions, usually found on tatami floors, are also very common. Tatami mats, which are made of straw, can be easily damaged and are hard to clean, thus shoes or any type of footwear are <b>always</b> <b>taken</b> off when stepping on tatami floors.|$|E

O'Connor has <b>always</b> <b>taken</b> criticism in good humour, even appearing with Morecambe and Wise on their 1975 Christmas Show in a sketch that mocked him.

The most important factor is time elapsed since onset of clinical signs, as this has a profound impact on prognosis. Additionally, a veterinarian will need to know any drugs given to the horse, their amount, and the time they were given, as those can help with the assessment of the colic progression and how it is responding to analgesia.|$|E

25|$|Punch and Judy {{shows have}} <b>always</b> <b>taken</b> place during summer {{right next to}} the pier on the beach to the west of it, and this {{tradition}} is continued in the annual Herne Bay Festival. Pierrots used to perform in the open air {{at the end of the}} pier until 1914, and in 2009 a recreation of such a show at the Herne Bay Bandstand was specially commissioned by the Council for Herne Bay Festival. Ken Russell chose Herne Bay Pier as the backdrop to the opening sequence of his first feature film, French Dressing (1963), and returned to Herne Bay in 2008 to bemoan the missing pier. It also featured in Hugues Burin des Roziers' film Blue jeans - Du beurre aux Allemands, filmed in 1976. In 2008 Canterbury art students designed a virtual pier as part of the Cultural Trail.|$|E
25|$|Both the PPE and SPE are RISC {{architectures}} with a fixed-width 32-bit instruction format. The PPE {{contains a}} 64-bit {{general purpose register}} set (GPR), a 64-bit floating point register set (FPR), and a 128-bit Altivec register set. The SPE contains 128-bit registers only. These {{can be used for}} scalar data types ranging from 8-bits to 64-bits in size or for SIMD computations on a variety of integer and floating point formats. System memory addresses for both the PPE and SPE are expressed as 64-bit values for a theoretic address range of 264 bytes (16 exabytes or 16,777,216 terabytes). In practice, not all of these bits are implemented in hardware. Local store addresses internal to the SPU (Synergistic Processor Unit) processor are expressed as a 32-bit word. In documentation relating to Cell a word is <b>always</b> <b>taken</b> to mean 32 bits, a doubleword means 64 bits, and a quadword means 128 bits.|$|E

500|$|Critic Matt Taibbi accused The New York Times of favoring Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the paper's news {{coverage}} of the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries. Responding to the complaints of many readers, New York Times public editor Margaret Sullivan wrote that [...] "The Times has not ignored Mr. Sanders's campaign, but it hasn't <b>always</b> <b>taken</b> it very seriously. The tone of some stories is regrettably dismissive, even mocking at times. Some of that is focused on the candidate's age, appearance and style, rather than what he has to say." [...] Times senior editor Carolyn Ryan defended both the volume of New York Times coverage (noting that Sanders had received about the same amount of article coverage as Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio) and its tone.|$|E
500|$|Bathurst and Thomas express {{contrasting}} {{views on}} the significance of Stroma's abandonment. Thomas regards it as a tragedy: [...] "Of all the out-of-the-way places I have known, this was the saddest. It seemed as though its life had been ended {{in a fit of}} pique." [...] To Bathurst, however, [...] "it is tempting to see Stroma's abandonment as the result of some appalling trauma. Abandonment is <b>always</b> <b>taken</b> as a sign of failure, a collective death... But Stroma does not feel sad. True, there is sorrow in seeing the once meticulous vegetable patches turned over to weeds, or wondering how many more winters the box beds will stand before they start to rot. But that isn't the whole story. What is interesting about Stroma is not the fact of its abandonment, but the tale of its past." ...|$|E

She explained to Billboard that [...] "in taking on a project like this, I'm taking the responsibility to talk for my race and my planet." [...] In an interview for the New York Post, she explained the album to be about [...] "the war against self ... against your inner being", and said of her hiatus, [...] "I've <b>always</b> <b>taken</b> my time between albums.

500|$|The {{location}} of the conclaves became fixed only in the fourteenth century. Since {{the end of the}} Western Schism in 1417, however, elections have <b>always</b> <b>taken</b> place in Rome (except in 1800, when French troops occupying Rome forced the election to be held in Venice), and normally in what, since the Lateran Treaties of 1929, has become the independent Vatican City State. Since 1846, when the Quirinal Palace was used, the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican has always served as the {{location of}} the election. Popes have often fine-tuned the rules for the election of their successors: Pope Pius XII's Vacantis Apostolicae Sedis of 1945 governed the conclave of 1958, Pope John XXIII's Summi Pontificis Electio of 1962 that of 1963, Pope Paul VI's Romano Pontifici Eligendo of 1975 those of 1978, and John Paul II's Universi Dominici Gregis of 1996 that of 2005. [...] Benedict XVI's De Aliquibus Mutationibus of 2007 governed the conclave of 2013.|$|E
500|$|From {{the middle}} of the 1370s, the Lackfis' {{influence}} diminished and new favorites emerged in the royal court. James Szepesi was appointed judge royal in 1373, and Nicholas Garay became the palatine in 1375. The organization of central government was also modified to create a more centralized power structure. Louis's [...] "secret seal", that he had <b>always</b> <b>taken</b> with him during his wars and journeys, was declared authentic, and Louis entrusted it to the secret chancellor who was always to accompany him. A new high official, the Lord Chancellor were authorized to use the great seal in the king's name in 1376 or 1377. Demetrius, Bishop of Zagreb, who was of humble origin, was the first to hold this new office. The Lord Chancellor became the head of a new central court of justice, called the court of [...] "the king's special presence" [...] in 1377. From around the same time, the royal free towns delegated jurors to assist the master of the treasury, who headed the court of appeal for the towns. A new official, the treasurer, took over the financial duties of the master of the treasury.|$|E
