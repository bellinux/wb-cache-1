2500|$|Originally, woodcarving was {{a solitary}} {{activity}} with all aspects done by one person, usually a male. As sales soared in the 1980s, the work {{began to be}} shared among family members.

Despite this, pieces are still referred to as the work of one person, usually the male carver. There are exceptions to this. There are men who paint better than they carve <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> of San Pedro Taviche, women collect and carve wood about as often as the men.

2500|$|... are {{sentences}} that are served {{outside of the}} prison walls <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> {{with some sort of}} restrictions or conditions placed on the offender, in an effort to reduce prison populations. [...] The requirements or conditions may include mandatory programs such as a drug or alcohol treatment seminars, curfews, house arrest, or electronic monitoring. [...] Most offenders who receive conditional sentences are low risk and are usually serving time for impaired driving where no death occurred. When an offender receives a conditional sentence of home confinement in comparison to incarceration, the offender is still able to see family members, maintain a normal job, and attend school. This is a huge advantage to conditional sentencing, since offenders are not completely cut off from the external world. [...] Although the offender is not locked away in a prison cell, the offender is still expected to stay at home during certain times of the day or night. [...] In order to verify that offenders are abiding by the restrictions placed on them, electronic monitoring is often used. The development of GPS, which allows law enforcement agencies to know the exact location of the offender by the use of satellites, has increased the effectiveness of offenders serving home confinement sentences drastically. Offenders can now easily be identified and tracked down through the use of GPS allowing law enforcement officers to quickly move in to make an arrest when an offender is in breach of their conditions.|$|E
60|$|A certain weariness possessed her. She was {{beginning}} to realize something about him: how he {{had no sense of}} home and domestic life, as an Englishman has.

He lived in the open air, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>community.</b> When the true Italian came out in him, his veriest home was the piazza of Pescocalascio, the little sort of market-place where the roads met in the village, under the castle, and where the men stood in groups and talked, talked, talked. This was where Ciccio belonged: his active, mindful self. His active, mindful self was none of hers. She only had his passive self, and his family passion. His masculine mind and intelligence had its home in the little public square of his village. She knew this as she watched him now, with all his body talking politics. He could not break off till he had finished. And then, with a swift, intimate handshake to the group with whom he had been engaged, he came away, putting all his interest off from himself.|$|E
