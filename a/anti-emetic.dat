40|$|Introduction: Vomiting in the {{emergency}} department after trauma occurs frequently and might lead to aspiration of gastric content. An orogastric tube (OGT) {{is a way to}} prevent emesis. However, this is an inconvenient procedure and may actually trigger vomiting. Therefore, a change in policy was applied from preferably an OGT to the administration of <b>anti-emetics</b> in a selected population. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse the prevention of vomiting in trauma patients after OGT or <b>anti-emetics.</b> Materials and methods: Retrospective cohort study. Data of all trauma patients presented at the crash room of {{the emergency}} department between July 1 st 2013 and July 1 st 2014 were collected from the local trauma registry and electronic patient documentation system and comprising 6 months preceding and 6 months after change of policy. Vomiting and nausea after trauma were recorded. Furthermore, complications such as aspiration and cardiac arrhythmias were documented. Results: A total of 1446 patients were presented after trauma. 230 patients were promptly intubated. An additional 763 patients were fully responsive and did not complain of nausea. The remaining 453 patients were further analysed. 44 patients received OGT placement procedure and 409 patients received antiemetics. Significant difference was found in patients vomiting after OGT placement or <b>anti-emetics</b> (20. 5 % vs. 2. 7 %; P < 0. 001). Patients who received <b>anti-emetics</b> were not more at risk for cardiac arrhythmias. After matched control analysis, there was still a significant difference was found. Discussion and conclusion: Administration of <b>anti-emetics</b> is suitable and effective for the prevention of vomiting after trauma in this selected population, without an increased risk for complications.

40|$|Despite {{the advent}} of classic <b>anti-emetics,</b> chemotherapy-induced nausea is still problematic, with {{vomiting}} being somewhat better managed in the clinic. If post-treatment nausea and vomiting are not properly controlled, anticipatory nausea—a conditioned response to the contextual cues associated with illness-inducing chemotherapy— can develop. Once it develops, anticipatory nausea is refractive to current <b>anti-emetics,</b> highlighting the need for alternative treatment options. One of the first documented medicinal uses of Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ 9 -THC) was {{for the treatment of}} chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and recent evidence is accumulating to suggest a role for the endocannabinoid system in modulating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.

40|$|Background: Tonsillectomy is the commonest ENT {{surgical}} procedure. The common postoperative morbidi-ties {{associated with}} tonsillectomy are nausea, vomiting, pain and bleeding. The {{objective of this}} study was to compare the effects of single intra-operative intravenous dose of dexamethasone versus control group on frequency of post tonsillectomy nausea and vomiting and need for rescue <b>anti-emetics</b> in the first 24 hours. Material & Methods: This comparative study was conducted at Department of ENT, DHQ Hospital, Lakki Marwat from January 2009 to June 2010. Patients of both gender aged 6 - 30 years were listed for elective tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy. Patients with history of acute tonsillitis within six weeks, bleeding diathesis, or those with a known contraindication to steroids, were excluded. Patients were divided into group 1 (treatment) and 2 (control) of 50 each on alternate basis. A single dose of dexamethasone was given to patients of group 1 intra-operatively, whereas patients in group 2 received nothing. The difference in frequency of postoperative nausea, vomiting and need for rescue <b>anti-emetics</b> between the two groups was analyzed by Chi-Square test. Results: Out of 100 patients, 66 were male and 34 female. Statistically significant decrease in frequency of nausea, vomiting and need for rescue <b>anti-emetics</b> (p=values 0. 006, 0. 014 and 0. 008 respectively) was noted in patients treated with dexamethasone...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This study aims to {{determine}} the prevalence of methotrexate-induced nausea and vomiting in both adolescent and adult patients with inflammatory arthritis. A survey of methotrexate side effects was conducted on patients with inflammatory arthritis. We provided a brief questionnaire to unselected patients with inflammatory arthritis being treated with methotrexate attending adolescent and adult rheumatol-ogy clinics. The questions related to the presence, absence, and severity of nausea and vomiting, the temporal relationship with methotrexate and whether <b>anti-emetics</b> had been pre-scribed. A total of 106 patients {{from the age of}} 13 years and above— 57 adults (over 20 years) and 49 adolescents (13 – 19 years) were included in this study. The median age for those experiencing nausea was 19 years (interquartile range (IQR) 7) and for those with no nausea 55 years (IQR 46) (p < 0. 001). Thirty-six out of 49 adolescent patients reported nausea (73 %) compared to only 20 / 57 adults (35 %) (p < 0. 001). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the nausea group had a significantly higher proportion of adolescents (p = 0. 0002), patients taking subcutaneous (SC) methotrexate MTX (p = 0. 002), and patients with duration of MTX of more than 1 year (p = 0. 049). Adolescents were estimated to have over 6 times higher odds of nausea com-pared to adults (OR 6. 31, 95 % CI 2. 38 to 16. 75, p = 0. 0002) after adjusting for SC MTX and duration of MTX. Only 22 % of adolescents and 10 % of adults were prescribed <b>anti-emetics.</b> There is a higher prevalence ofMTX-induced nausea and vomiting in adolescents and younger adult patients with inflammatory arthritis compared to older adults. The role of <b>anti-emetics</b> in the treatment of these symptoms is unclear...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{carried out}} a {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of prophylactic dexamethasone on post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV), post-operative pain, and complications in patients undergoing thyroidectomy. METHODS: We searched Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the prophylactic effect of dexamethasone versus placebo with or without other antiemetics for PONV in patients undergoing thyroidectomy. Meta-analyses were performed using RevMan 5. 0 software. RESULTS: Thirteen RCTs that considered high quality evidence including 2, 180 patients were analyzed. The meta-analysis demonstrated {{a significant decrease in}} the incidence of PONV (RR 0. 52, 95 % CI 0. 43 to 0. 63, P < 0. 00001), the need for rescue <b>anti-emetics</b> (RR 0. 42, 95 % CI 0. 30 to 0. 57, P< 0. 00001), post-operative pain scores (WMD - 1. 17, 95 % CI - 1. 91 to - 0. 44, P = 0. 002), and the need for rescue analgesics (RR 0. 65, 95 % CI 0. 50 - 0. 83, P = 0. 0008) in patients receiving dexamethasone compared to placebo, with or without concomitant antiemetics. Dexamethasone 8 - 10 mg had a significantly greater effect for reducing the incidence of PONV than dexamethasone 1. 25 - 5 mg. Dexamethasone was as effective as other <b>anti-emetics</b> for reducing PONV (RR 1. 25, 95 % CI 0. 86 - 1. 81, P = 0. 24). A significantly higher level of blood glucose during the immediate post-operative period in patients receiving dexamethasone compared to controls was the only adverse event. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic dexamethasone 8 - 10 mg administered intravenously before induction of anesthesia should be recommended as a safe and effective strategy for reducing the incidence of PONV, the need for rescue <b>anti-emetics,</b> post-operative pain, and the need for rescue analgesia in thyroidectomy patients, except those that are pregnant, have diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or contraindications for dexamethasone. More high quality trials are warranted to define the benefits and risks of prophylactic dexamethasone in potential patients with a high risk for PONV...|$|R

25|$|Treatment in {{the acute}} setting is mostly focused on {{symptomatic}} management. After initial {{treatment in the}} hospital, some patients will need short-term placement {{in a nursing home}} or rehabilitation facility before going home. In hospital settings the doctors work with speech pathologists in issues like these. Typically, a commonly used tool to assess the degree of severity of dysphagia and speech issues is the Barnes Jewish Hospital Stroke Dysphagia Screen, which offers a validated guide to assessing plan of action (solid food diet, all liquid diet, IV hydration, etc.) for the patient while in the hospital and the proper course of action in the outpatient setting. Rehabilitation in Wallenberg’s Syndrome focuses on improving balance, coordination, working on activities of daily living, and improving speech and swallowing function. Severe nausea and vertigo can be present and limit progress in rehabilitation and recovery. Symptomatic treatment with <b>anti-emetics</b> and medications for the hiccups are important. Commonly used <b>anti-emetics</b> include ondansetron, metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, and promethazine. These medications are also used to treat hiccups, along with chlorpromazine. There are case reports of other medications useful in treating hiccups in Wallenberg’s Syndrome including baclofen and anti-epileptic medications. The prognosis for someone with lateral medullary syndrome depends upon the size and location of damaged area of the brain stem. Some individuals recover quickly while others may have significant neurological disabilities for months to years after the initial injury.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAntineoplastic drug induced {{nausea and}} {{vomiting}} (AINV) {{is a major}} adverse event which deeply impacts {{the quality of life}} of children with cancer. It additionally causes distress to parents and negatively impacts compliance to therapy. A robust AINV prophylaxis regimen is essential to achieve complete control; and prevent anticipatory, breakthrough and refractory AINV. With a wide array of available <b>anti-emetics,</b> standard guidelines for their use are crucial to ensure uniform and optimum prophylaxis. Chemotherapeutic agents are classified as having high, moderate, low or minimal emetic risk based on their potential to cause emesis in the absence of prophylaxis. Three drug regimen with aprepitant, ondansetron/granisetron and dexamethasone is recommended for protocols with high emetic risk. Although approved in children ≥ 12 years, there is mounting evidence for the use of aprepitant in younger children too. In protocols with moderate and low emetic risk, combination of ondansetron/granisetron and dexamethasone; and single agent ondansetron/granisetron are recommended, respectively. Metoclopramide is an alternative when steroids are contraindicated. Olanzapine and lorazepam are useful drugs for breakthrough AINV and anticipatory AINV. Knowledge of pediatric dosage, salient adverse events, drug interactions as well as cost of drugs is essential to prescribe <b>anti-emetics</b> accurately and safely in resource constrained settings.
