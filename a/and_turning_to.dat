5|$|After {{intersecting}} with NY289, NY178 progresses northeastward, {{intersecting with}} the western terminus of CR84 {{in the community of}} Thomas Settlement. After leaving Thomas Settlement, NY178 intersects with CR77 <b>and</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> the southeast through a rural region before entering the village of Adams at an intersection with Cobbville Road. There, the surroundings become further residential, before the highway connects to I-81 at exit41. After the interchange, NY178 becomes known as Church Street West, crosses over a railroad line and enters the downtown portion of Adams. After the intersection with Clay Street, NY178 intersects with US11 (Main Street), where the NY178 designation ends. The right-of-way continues eastward as Church Street East, which becomes CR69 at the east village line.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Alice is {{the only}} known Atlantic {{hurricane}} to span two calendar years and {{one of only two}} named Atlantic tropical cyclones, along with Tropical Storm Zeta of 2005, to do so. The twelfth tropical cyclone and the eighth hurricane of the 1954 Atlantic hurricane season, Alice developed on December 30, 1954 from a trough of low pressure in the central Atlantic Ocean in an area of unusually favorable conditions. The storm moved southwestward and gradually strengthened to reach hurricane status. After passing through the Leeward Islands on January 2, 1955, Alice reached peak winds of 90mph (150km/h) before encountering cold air <b>and</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> the southeast. It dissipated on January 6 over the southeastern Caribbean Sea.|$|E

5|$|Hearts {{started the}} match as the {{brighter}} {{of the two}} teams. Rudi Skácel headed wide early on from an Andrew Driver cross. Hearts took the lead through Darren Barr in the 15th minute, scoring from close range. Hearts continued to control the match and Pa Kujabi picked up a booking for fouling Suso Santana. Skácel then doubled Hearts' lead after receiving {{the ball on the}} edge of the area <b>and</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> hit a shot which deflected off James McPake before going in. Hibs then had an opportunity as Kujabi's cross came to Garry O'Connor, but he hit his shot over the bar. McPake then made a goal-line clearance from a Suso shot which had beaten Hibs' keeper Mark Brown. McPake got Hibs back into the game from a corner. Tom Soares' initial delivery was cleared but he got the ball back out on the wing and put in a low cross which McPake converted.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Gordon was a {{long-lived}} and catastrophic late-season hurricane of the 1994 Atlantic hurricane season. The twelfth {{and final}} tropical cyclone of the season, Gordon {{formed in the}} southwestern Caribbean on November8. Without strengthening, the storm made landfall on Nicaragua. Later on November 10, the storm began to strengthen as it tracked further from land, and it quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Gordon, the seventh named storm that season. Gordon also made landfalls in Jamaica and Cuba while a minimal tropical storm. It entered the southwestern Atlantic while resembling a subtropical cyclone. By the time it entered the Gulf of Mexico, it was fully tropical again. Tropical Storm Gordon later crossed the Florida Keys, <b>and</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> the northeast it made landfall in Fort Myers, Florida. Gordon strengthened after it re-entered the Atlantic Ocean, becoming a hurricane on November 17. It briefly threatened North Carolina while turning to the northwest, although it turned {{to the south and}} weakened. Gordon deteriorated into a tropical depression and struck Florida again at that intensity on November20. It turned to the north and dissipated the next day over South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kenneth was {{the strongest}} and longest-tracked {{hurricane}} of the 2005 Pacific hurricane season. The eleventh named storm and fifth hurricane of the season, Kenneth developed from a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone to the southwest of Mexico on September 14. It quickly attained peak winds of 135mph (215km/h) on September 18, before weakening due to increased wind shear <b>and</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> a southwest drift. After weakening to tropical storm status, Kenneth attained a steady west-northwest motion and encountered favorable enough conditions for it to gain power and attain hurricane status on September 25. The cyclone again weakened as its motion halted, and on September 30 Kenneth dissipated a short distance off the Big Island of Hawaii. The remnants of Kenneth produced {{one of the highest}} rainfall totals in Hawaii, reaching up to 12inches (305mm) on Oahu. The rainfall caused flooding, though no major damage was reported.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Kristy in 2006 was a {{relatively}} long-lived tropical cyclone in the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. It developed on August30 from a tropical wave off the southwest coast of Mexico, and quickly intensified to attain hurricane status, reaching peak winds of 80mph (130km/h). Subsequently, Kristy weakened from cooler waters and increased wind shear from Hurricane John to its northeast. Steering currents weakened, <b>and</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> a southerly drift, it weakened to a tropical depression by September2. The next day it briefly regained tropical storm status, only to again deteriorate to depression status. After turning to the west, Kristy encountered marginally favorable conditions and attained tropical storm status for a third time, though unfavorable conditions caused it to dissipate on September9. The storm never affected land, although initially {{there was a slight}} threat to Clarion Island. Within the National Hurricane Center area of warning responsibility east of 140°W, Hurricane Kristy was the longest-lasting tropical cyclone of the season.|$|E
5|$|NY386 {{begins at}} a {{three-way}} intersection with NY383 {{on the west}} side of the village of Scottsville. From this junction, NY383 heads south and east while NY386 takes the west exit, passing under the Rochester and Southern Railroad <b>and</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> the northwest as it encircles the village. At North Road, which acts as a westward extension of NY253, NY386 passes the middle and high schools of the Wheatland–Chili Central School District and becomes Scottsville–Chili Road. The route continues onward, leaving Scottsville and entering an open, rural area of the town of Wheatland. NY386 remains on a northwesterly track to the Chili town line, where it curves to the north as it approaches and crosses over the New York State Thruway (I-90).|$|E

5|$|Critics {{reported}} that players rarely {{need to use}} Undead Nightmare new weapons. Whitehead (Eurogamer) said that Marston's firearms are mostly indistinguishable apart from the blunderbuss, which is only useful when the player is overrun by zombies. GameSpot added that the game's combat is repetitive and less fun in the expansion, as zombies barely pose a threat. The zombies, without guns, cover, horses, lack the complexities of cowboys and, apart {{from some of the}} special zombie types, are only a threat at short distances. The reviewer found little variation between weapons when firing at close range, which is more effective than aiming at a distance. The fun of the new guns quickly faded for the critic, who found little incentive to use traditional gunfight strategies. Whitehead (Eurogamer) too noted that the base game relied on its use of cover during gunfights, which the expansion jettisons altogether. Thus the player is forced into the technique of backtracking <b>and</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> use the time-slowing Dead Eye mode to clear zombies with headshots. The reviewer also found the controls clumsy and often tripped on piles of zombie bodies or became stuck in doorways. While the idea of zombie animals scared Whitehead, he was both relieved and disappointed to find that bears and cougars, like the humans, died with a single bullet.|$|E
5|$|The ride {{begins with}} Evac {{moving out of}} the loading station and making a turn. The vehicle {{approaches}} the first of thirteen 3D high-definition video screens which depicts Ravage grabbing a canister containing the AllSpark. Evac spins 180° to face the second screen on which Bumblebee is fighting Sideways for the AllSpark, which ends up in Evac's possession. Evac reverses into one of two elevator shafts which ascend to the second level of the attraction. During the ascent Optimus Prime battles Megatron and Grindor chases Evac who is furiously heading in reverse until Grindor's arm is broken off by a train. Megatron grabs Evac and the two struggle until Megatron breaks a water pipe, which sprays riders with water. Evac enters a dead end pathway before reversing <b>and</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> face another 3D screen, which shows Megatron firing a missile at Evac while continuing to find Optimus. Hot air and fog generate the illusion of an explosion. Evac then heads through the hole in a building which was caused by the explosion. Inside lies Devastator, who is trying to suck everything out of the building. Ratchet and Ironhide cover fire while Evac reverses and escapes the suction. Here the Autobot Sideswipe helps in the battle against the Decepticon Bonecrusher. Devastator returns to the scene alongside Starscream. Evac escapes from Devastator a second time by going through him, but Starscream grabs Evac and throws him across several city blocks before landing on a construction site and smashing into some drums which release clouds of fog resulting in Evac asking if the riders are okay. Optimus Prime and Megatron continue their battle in the construction site as Evac reverses away in an attempt to protect the AllSpark. Starscream appears for a second time but is chased away by two NEST helicopters. Evac then returns to a second set of two elevators. During the descent to the ground floor, Evac forces the AllSpark into Megatron's chest causing both to freefall to the ground when Megatron grabs Evac. Bumblebee saves Evac from destruction before Optimus Prime congratulates Evac and the riders on their mission. The last thing guests see before disembarking is the twisted wreckage of Megatron stuck in the ceiling near the exit.|$|E

25|$|It is {{important}} to remember that unlike, for example, Roman roads, these medieval routes were not essentially physical entities—thin strips of land with physical boundaries; rather they were rights of way, sometimes with legal and traditional status. Routes tended to follow the line of least resistance, twisting <b>and</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> avoid poorly drained areas and land that was easily overlooked. Where there was a hill to climb or a difficult area to pass through, multiple tracks would develop, the traveller taking the easiest route. Routes may also have varied seasonally as changing weather affected the condition of the pathway.|$|E
25|$|After {{crossing}} {{back into}} Passaic County, Skyline Drive (and County Route 692) continue northward through Ringwood State Park before curving {{its way out}} of the northern reaches of the park. At this point, the highway enters the borough of Ringwood, where the dense forestry changes back to residences. The route continues through Ringwood, crossing several local streets <b>and</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> the northwest once again. Just before the intersection with Countryside Lane, Skyline Drive turns to the northeast and once again, enters the dense forestry. After crossing through a large residential complex, the highway continues curving its way northward, turning westward one final time at the intersection with Erskine Road. After the curve, Skyline Drive and County Route692 continue the short stretch westward, terminating at County Route511 (the Greenwood Lake Turnpike) in the community of Ringwood, near the shores of the Wanaque Reservoir.|$|E
25|$|The route {{crosses to}} {{the east side of}} I-81 and {{continues}} into Pittston Township, where it heads east of a park and ride lot and passes businesses as it reaches a trumpet interchange that connects to the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-476). A short distance later, PA 315 comes to another interchange with I-81 that has access to and from the northbound direction of the interstate. After this interchange, the route splits into a one-way pair and enters Dupont, with northbound PA 315 following Chestnut Street and southbound PA 315 following Ziegler Street. In this area, the road passes a mix of homes and businesses. In the center of Dupont, southbound PA 315 becomes Main Street, with the two directions of the route joining farther to the north. At this point, the route becomes four-lane undivided Airport Road and enters woodland, crossing into Avoca <b>and</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> the northeast and becoming a divided highway. PA 315 reaches its northern terminus at the entrance of the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport, just past a final interchange with I-81 on the border of Avoca and Pittston Township.|$|E

The hurricane reached peak winds of [...] on October19 before weakening <b>and</b> <b>turning</b> <b>to</b> the northeast. Roslyn ultimately moved ashore near Mazatlán, Sinaloa as a minimal hurricane, where it caused minimal damage due to the light population affected.
