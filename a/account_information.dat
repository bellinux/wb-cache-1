25|$|Male Banggai {{cardinalfish}} also exhibit preference by size, as larger females tend to lay larger eggs, and egg size positively affects traits such as offspring size, survival, growth, {{time until}} maturation, and swimming performance. However, {{it also takes}} into <b>account</b> <b>information</b> conveyed by females’ courting movement. The ‘side by side trembling’ described {{in the previous section}} can be subcategorized into two different movements: ‘rush’ and ‘twitch’. ‘Rush’ refers to {{the first part of the}} movement when the females approaches the male, folding the pelvic, dorsal and anal fins together and quickly swimming past the male for a distance of 10-40 centimeters. Then it performs the ‘twitch’, where it twitches, or trembles her body close to the male. Studies have shown that the intensity of the ‘rush’ behavior is important for the male in predicting the female’s potential reproductive effort, as the intensity of the behavior correlates positively with clutch weight. On the other hand, the number of twitches performed per day strongly associates with how close to spawning the female is. By forming a pair with a female with more mature eggs, or closer to spawning, a male can increase his reproductive rate. Furthermore, it can match his readiness to spawn to females’ by observing its ‘twitch’ behavior.|$|E
