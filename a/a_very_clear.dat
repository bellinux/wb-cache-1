This style of bouyon music was originated in Dominica, but is also very popular in Saint Lucia, Guadeloupe and Martinique.|$|E
5|$|In the italic, the {{expansive}} ascenders of Tagliente's type were shortened and the curl {{to the right}} replaced with more conventional serifs. Monotype also cut italic capitals sloped to match the lower-case, whereas in the Renaissance italics were used with upright capital letters in the Roman inscriptional tradition. The bold (Monotype's invention, since Griffo and his contemporaries did not use bold type) is extremely solid, providing <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> contrast to the regular styles, and Monotype also added lining (upper-case height) figures {{as well as the}} text figures (at lower-case height) used in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.|$|E
5|$|The {{performance}} of Rebecca {{seems to me}} to have taken us further into the danger area instead of showing any improvement. I am unable to defend at a time when departmental costs and scene loads are in an acute state the load imposed by Rebecca on Design and Supply and the expenditure upon extras and costumes... the vast area of the hall and the stairway never justified the great expenditure of effort required in building and one is left with <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> impression of reaching a point where the department must be accused of not knowing what it is doing.|$|E

6000|$|... [DAISY enters. SHE is an {{extremely}} pretty woman, beautifully, perhaps a little showily, dressed. She has <b>a</b> pale, <b>very</b> <b>clear,</b> slightly sallow skin, and beautiful dark eyes. There is only the very faintest suspicion in them of the Chinese slant. Her hair is abundant and black.|$|R

Is it not {{a novelty}} which strikes {{at the root of}} our [...] {{parliamentary}} government? under which the first duty of a majority [...] freshly elected, according to a uniform course of precedent and <b>a</b> [...] <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> principle, is to establish a government which has its [...] confidence.|$|R
5|$|Where {{the shot}} is {{tracking}} with Superman as he flies (such {{as in the}} Superman and Lois Metropolis flying sequence), front projection was used. This involved photographing the actors suspended {{in front of a}} background image dimly projected from the front onto a special screen made by 3M that would reflect light back at many times the original intensity directly into a combined camera/projector. The result was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> and intense photographic reproduction of both the actors and the background plate, with far less image deterioration or lighting problems than occur with rear projection.|$|E
5|$|I think {{everyone}} who disses the Columbine RPG is gutless. Most haven't played the game, or have played it with such preconceptions that they're blinded to the genuis , the honesty, {{the beauty of}} its social commentary. Super Columbine Massacre RPG is riddled with design flaws and has mediocre graphics by 1995, the maker of the game admits this, but it regardless {{is a work of}} art. It puts you in the mindset of the killers and provides <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> suggestion of why they did what they did; they were enacting an ideological demonstration through a terrorist act, and the game shines light on this as an indictment of the American dream and way of life painfully close to the main nerve.|$|E
5|$|The {{porpoise}} eye {{is relatively}} small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, {{the eyes of a}} porpoise are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When porpoises surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; their eyes contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light. Porpoises do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most porpoises have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, they are able to form <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> image of the surrounding area.|$|E
2500|$|As regards Dee's {{physical}} appearance, the antiquary John Aubrey {{gives the}} following description: [...] "He {{was tall and}} slender. He wore a gown like an artist's gown, with hanging sleeves, and <b>a</b> slit.... <b>A</b> <b>very</b> fair, <b>clear</b> sanguine complexion... a long beard as white as milk. <b>A</b> <b>very</b> handsome man." ...|$|R

25|$|Hercules {{contains}} two bright globular clusters: M13, the brightest globular cluster {{in the northern}} hemisphere, and M92. It also contains the nearly spherical planetary nebula Abell 39. M13 lies between the stars η Her and ζ Her; it is dim, but may be detected by the unaided eye on <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> night.|$|E
5000|$|Tagua is a nut from South America {{grown on}} a Tagua Palm Tree. They have similar {{properties}} to animal ivory so it's {{also known as}} Vegetable Ivory.

25|$|On 18 August 2016, {{a report}} for a Euro-Med Monitor team {{confirmed}} {{that one of}} the hospitals, overcrowded by injured civilians, was bombarded by Russian warplanes in the western Aleppo countryside, which, according to Euro-Med Monitor, is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> violation of the international laws saying that those civilians must be protected from the continuing conflict.|$|E
25|$|M92 is a {{globular}} cluster of magnitude 6.4, 26,000 light-years from earth. It is a Shapley class IV cluster, indicating {{that it is}} quite concentrated at the center; it has <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> nucleus. M92 is visible as a fuzzy star in binoculars, like M13; it is denser and smaller than the more celebrated cluster. The oldest {{globular cluster}} known at 14 billion years, its stars are resolvable in a medium-aperture amateur telescope.|$|E
25|$|This {{operation}} is aimed very specifically at {{people we have}} information to suggest {{may be involved in}} gun crime or other offences. We want to send out <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> message to those who carry guns in Lambeth, don't. It is time to stop {{the vast majority of people}} in this borough feeling afraid to be on the street and make it the gunmen who are fearful of their community helping the police to arrest them.|$|E

Pilsen style lagers are marketed internationally by numerous small brewers and larger conglomerates.|$|R
25|$|Throughout {{his writing}} Mailer never {{presents}} <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> perspective on race. His works {{range from a}} profound understanding of the African American condition in America to extremely stereotypical depictions of race. For the majority of Mailer’s career he does not delve directly into race, but chose to pursue the matter only as a side note to the larger currents of the 1960s and 1970s. Mailer does however spend some time working through the issue in “The White Negro”, Of a Fire on the Moon, and in his work The Fight about the heavyweight title bout between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman.|$|E
25|$|Haughey on {{the other}} hand was distrusted by a number of his Cabinet colleagues but was much more {{respected}} by new backbenchers who were worried about the safety of their Dáil seats. When the vote was taken Haughey emerged as the victor by a margin of 44 votes to 38, <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> division within the party. In a conciliatory gesture, Colley was re-appointed as Tánaiste and had a veto over whom Haughey would appoint as Ministers for Justice and for Defence. This was due to his distrust of Haughey on security issues (because of the Arms Crisis). However he was removed from the important position of Minister for Finance.|$|E
25|$|Magazines {{for every}} taste and fetish were soon created {{due to the}} low cost of {{producing}} them. Magazines for the gay community flourished, the most notable {{and one of the}} first being Physique Pictorial, started in 1951 by Bob Mizer when his attempt to sell the services of male models; however, Athletic Model Guild photographs of them failed. It was published in black and white, in <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> yet photographic manner celebrating the male form and was published for nearly 50 years. The magazine was innovative in its use of props and costumes to depict the now standard gay icons like cowboys, gladiators and sailors.|$|E
50|$|<b>As</b> is <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> {{from the}} Vita S. Aethelwoldi, Wulfstan {{was the primary}} figure in effecting the canonization of St. Aethelwold and was also {{instrumental}} in establishing and promoting the Cult of St. Aethelwold. The promotion of the cult was dependent on {{the publication of a}} suitable Vita text to display Aethelwold’s sanctity and miraculous powers, as well as the composition of the necessary hymns and prayers for the liturgical commemoration of the saint on his feast-day. As precentor, Wulfstan fulfilled these duties and solidified Aethelwold’s position as an honoured Anglo-Saxon saint.|$|R
5000|$|Václav Klaus, former {{president}} of the Czech Republic and an economist, recommended Heaven and Earth in a blurb on the dust jacket: [...] "This is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> powerful, <b>clear,</b> understandable and extremely useful book."

5000|$|Arthur Crawshay Alliston Hall was {{the third}} bishop of Vermont in The Episcopal Church. As a person, Hall {{combined}} [...] "a thoroughly consecrated character, a commanding, winning personality, <b>a</b> <b>very</b> quick and <b>clear</b> and wise mind, a deeply spiritual purpose and outlook, <b>a</b> <b>very</b> thorough scholarship, <b>a</b> loving heart, alive {{with a sense of}} humor, which never suggested the slightest touch of irreverence." ...|$|R
25|$|Vitamin B1 or {{thiamine}} {{is present}} at a concentration between 0.2 and 0.5 milligrams per litre. This vitamin {{is necessary for}} the proper growth of yeasts that ensure alcoholic fermentation. In the must of healthy grapes the natural quantity is sufficient for the yeast. On the other hand, for a degraded harvest (by gray mold), the degradation of this vitamin leads the winemaker to add it to the must to ensure a trouble-free fermentation. In the case of a harvest with <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> wort and low temperature the yeast works in a limited way and the addition of thiamine can help avoid a difficult end of fermentation. Legislation limits the amount added to 30 milligrams per hectolitre.|$|E
25|$|Oroonoko is {{the first}} English novel to show Africans in a {{sympathetic}} manner. At the same time, this novel {{is as much about}} the nature of kingship as it is about the nature of race. Oroonoko is a prince, and he is of noble lineage whether of African or European descent, and the novel's regicide is devastating to the colony. The theatrical nature of the plot follows from Behn's previous experience as a dramatist. The language she uses in Oroonoko is far more straightforward than in her other novels, and she dispenses {{with a great deal of}} the emotional content of her earlier works. Further, the novel is unusual in Behn's fictions by having <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> love story without complications of gender roles.|$|E
25|$|According to legends {{recorded}} by the missionaries in the 1860s, the island originally had <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> class system, with an ariki, king, wielding absolute God-like power ever since Hotu Matua had arrived on the island. The most visible element in the culture was production of massive moai {{that were part of}} the ancestral worship. With a strictly unified appearance, moai were erected along most of the coastline, indicating a homogeneous culture and centralized governance. In addition to the royal family, the island's habitation consisted of priests, soldiers and commoners. The last king, along with his family, died as a slave in the 1860s in the Peruvian mines. Long before that, the king had become a mere symbolic figure, remaining respected and untouchable, but having only nominal authority.|$|E
5000|$|Susanna and the Magical Orchestra is the moniker of singer Susanna Wallumrød and {{keyboard}} player Morten Qvenild. Their {{style of}} {{music can be}} described as quiet, slow pop mixed with elements from electronica and jazz. Susanna has <b>a</b> <b>very</b> distinct, <b>clear</b> and cool voice that stands much on its own, only accompanied by Morten on various keyboard instruments such as acoustic piano, synthesizers and even harpsichord and church organ. The duo is mostly known for their highly personal interpretations of well known songs such as Dolly Parton's [...] "Jolene" [...] and Leonard Cohen's [...] "Hallelujah".|$|R
