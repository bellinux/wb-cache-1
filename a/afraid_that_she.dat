2500|$|Zheng {{started playing}} tennis {{when she was}} 10, after she saw her older sister play and thought tennis would be good exercise. At first, it was just for exercise.

(In fact, she was called [...] "xiao bu dier" [...] by her parents, which {{translates}} into {{something along the lines of}} [...] "small kid."

They considered her focusing more on her studies, so that if she did not make it in tennis she would be able to get a different job.

2500|$|Duncan {{was found}} to be in {{possession}} of a mocked-up HMS Barham hat-band. This apparently related to an alleged manifestation of the spirit of a dead sailor on HMS Barham, although Duncan appeared unaware that after 1939, sailors' hat bands carried only 'H.M.S.' and did not identify the ship they were serving on. She was initially arrested under section 4 of the Vagrancy Act 1824, a minor offence tried by magistrates. The authorities regarded the case as more serious, and eventually discovered section 4 of the Witchcraft Act 1735, covering fraudulent [...] "spiritual" [...] activity, which was triable before a jury. Charged alongside her for conspiracy to contravene this Act were Ernest and Elizabeth Homer, who operated the Psychic centre in Portsmouth, and Frances Brown, who was Duncan's agent who went with her to set up séances. There were seven counts in total, two of conspiracy to contravene the Witchcraft Act, two of obtaining money by false pretences, and three of public mischief (a common law offence). The prosecution may be explained by the mood of suspicion prevailing at the time: the authorities were <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could continue to reveal classified information, whatever her source was. There were also concerns that she was exploiting the recently bereaved, as the Recorder noted when passing sentence.|$|E

2500|$|Janet Arvizo first {{approached}} attorney Bill Dickerman {{to discuss}} taking {{legal action against}} Martin Bashir. Dickerman referred her to Larry Feldman, the attorney who represented Jordan Chandler , the first accuser, in 1993. Feldman then contacted child psychologist Stan Katz, who told Santa Barbara sheriff's investigator Paul Zelis that [...] "Mr. Feldman actually referred these kids to me. Because {{they had come to}} him in this lawsuit." [...] It was then that allegations of child molestation surfaced, and Katz reported this to the authorities, as is compulsory for someone in his profession in such cases. He said in a taped conversation that he didn't consider Jackson a pedophile but a [...] "regressed 10-year-old." [...] Larry Feldman was the attorney who helped Jordan Chandler win an out-of-court settlement reportedly for $20million, and Dr. Katz was the psychologist that assisted Evan Chandler in uncovering whether his son was suffering abuse. The defense later focused on Feldman and Katz, stressing that Janet went to the same people who helped obtain a settlement from Jackson in 1993 prior to ever going to the police. The circumstances by which the Arvizos' allegations surfaced aroused suspicion over their claims and caused some to believe that the family was merely seeking money. Others believed that Janet sought legal advice perhaps because she was <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could be charged with child endangerment for allowing her sons to sleep in Jackson's bed.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 October 1766, Sophia Magdalena {{was married}} to Gustav by proxy at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen with her brother Frederick, Hereditary Prince of Denmark as {{representative}} of her groom. She traveled in the royal golden sloop from Kronborg in Denmark over Öresund to Hälsingborg in Sweden; when she was halfway, the Danish cannon salute ended, and the Swedish started to fire. In Helsingborg, she was welcomed by her brother-in-law Prince Charles of Hesse, who had crossed the sea shortly before her, the Danish envoy in Stockholm, Baron Schack, as well as Crown Prince Gustav. As {{she was about to}} set foot on ground, Gustav was <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would fall, and he therefore reached her his hand with the words: [...] "Watch out, Madame!", a reply which quickly became a topic of gossip at the Swedish court. The couple then traveled by land toward Stockholm, being celebrated on the way. She met her father-in-law the King and her brothers-in-law at Stäket Manor on 27 October, and she continued to be well-treated and liked by them all during her life in Sweden. Thereafter, she met her mother-in-law the Queen and her sister-in-law at Säby Manor, and on the 28th, she was formally presented for the Swedish royal court at Drottningholm Palace. At this occasion, Countess Ebba Bonde noted that the impression about her was: [...] "By God, how beautiful she is!", but that her appearance was affected by {{the fact that she had}} a: [...] "terrible fear of the Queen". The 4 November 1766, she was officially welcomed to the capital of Stockholm, were the she {{was married to}} Gustav in person in the Royal Chapel at Stockholm Royal Palace.|$|E
2500|$|During the Coup of Gustav III on 19 August 1772, Sophia Magdalena was at Ekolsund Castle. After {{having been}} {{told of the}} {{successful}} coup where her consort had reinstated absolute monarchy, she confided to her Mistress of the Robes, Countess Anna Maria Hjärne, that she was <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would now be divorced by Gustav, because {{she knew she was}} not liked by him, because she had not given birth, and because she knew she was being slandered before him. Gustav III was told of this and her words led to a conflict. At a following ball at Ekolsund, the King told Count Axel von Fersen the Elder, that he did plan to divorce her on the grounds of pro-Danish plots and adultery with riksråd Count Fredrik Sparre and Marcus Gerhard Rosencrone of the Danish legation in Stockholm. von Fersen, however, convinced him not to by saying that she should not be regarded to participate in pro-Danish plots just for her love of her Danish chamber-maids, and that as a neglected wife, she should not be blamed for enjoying the compliments of Count Ribbing, which were not grounds for suspicions of adultery. During this period, it had been noted that Count Ribbing was often seen in the company of the Queen and had paid her compliments and made her laugh, among other things by caricaturing her Mistress of the Robes Countess Anna Maria Hjärne. Countess Hjärne had informed the King that the Queen was pregnant [...] "And the riksråd Ribbing is her favorite." [...] The King had given Countess Ulrica Catharina Stromberg the task to investigate this, and she was told by the chamber madame of Sophia Magdalena, Charlotta Hellman: [...] "information, which where dubious, especially since the clearest evidence could be gathered from the linen of the Queen". [...] her contact with Rosencrone {{is said to have been}} restricted to the fact that he handled her correspondence with Denmark. After the reconciliation of Sophia Magdalena and Gustav III, he apologized to her for having believed these rumors.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1930s, {{the family}} {{acquired}} {{and moved to}} Sissinghurst Castle, near Cranbrook, Kent. Sissinghurst had once been owned by Vita's ancestors, which gave it a dynastic attraction to her after her father had disinherit her from Knole and his title. There the couple created the famous gardens that are now run by the National Trust. One of Vita's male suitors was Henry Lascelles, who would later marry the Princess Royal and become the 6th Earl of Harewood. Vita Sackville-West also had a passionate affair between 1929 and 1931 with Hilda Matheson, head of the BBC Talks Department. She called Hilda by the pet name of [...] "Stoker" [...] during their liaison. In 1931, Sackville-West was in a ménage à trois with journalist Evelyn Irons, who had interviewed her after her novel The Edwardians was published and became a best-seller, and Irons's lover, Olive Rinder. Sackville-West's 1932 novel Family History {{is the first of}} her books to raise the subject of lesbianism, albeit in an oblique form where the 24-year old heroine Evelyn Jerrold has more than familial feelings of love for her teenage niece Ruth. Jerrold, ashamed of feelings for Ruth, tries to destroy them by marrying a man named Miles Vane-Merrick, who she accidentally destroys by demanding more and more from him as she cannot bring herself to admit to her love for Ruth or see that Vane-Merrick cannot be a substitute for Ruth. The characters of Viola and Leonard Anquetil in Family History who are socialists, pacifists and feminists are thinly veiled versions of Virginia and Leonard Woolf. In Orlando, Woolf allowed Sackville-West to finally [...] "own" [...] Knole, and in Family History, she returns the favor as the Anquetils have children who are intelligent and decent people whom any parent could be proud of. Woolf never had children and was <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> would have been a bad mother if she did, so Sackville-West, in having her fictional alter-ego be an excellent mother {{was meant to be a}} [...] "gift" [...] to Woolf. Though Sackville-West regarded Nicolson's involvement with Sir Oswald Mosley's New Party (soon to be renamed the British Union of Fascists) as [...] "unfortunate", an angry Woolf wrote her in August 1931: [...] "Potto [...] expiring. What about Harold and Mosley? But don't write if it hurts". In the 1930s, Woolf and Sackville-West clashed over the question of pacifism as Sackville-West supported rearmament while Woolf remained loyal to her pacifism, leading to an end of their relationship in 1935.|$|E
2500|$|The story follows Sakura, a 14-year-old princess who'd rather marry {{for love}} and make her own choices in life than be married away to someone she's never met. Her best friend is Asagiri, a cute female Mononoke (a tiny spirit) who she once saved from a life of slavery (unbeknownst to her, Asagiri is really a Yuki-Onna). Since birth, she's been engaged to Prince Oura. Not wanting to marry the prince after a {{precarious}} argument with Prince Oura's messenger, named Aoba, Sakura runs away but gets lost and accidentally looks at the full moon, which she was warned to never do. A man-eating demon arrives, referring to Sakura as [...] "Princess Kaguya" [...] and nearly wounds her, but Aoba and a priestess that Sakura knows named Byakuya arrive. Priestess Byakuya tells Sakura that she is in fact Princess Kaguya's granddaughter {{and is the only}} one able to destroy the demons. By drawing a pair of back-to-back crescent moons on her palm, she is able to summon the mystic sword Chizakura and kill the demon. She also discovers the word “destroy” is actually her Soul Symbol (a symbol each person possesses that best represents his or her true nature). Soon after, Sakura, Asagiri, and Aoba travel to Prince Oura's estate, where it's discovered that Aoba actually is Prince Oura, explaining {{that he wanted to be}} mischievous. Of course, the two don't get along from then on, until finally while relaxing under a tree, the two finally seem to come to an understanding, and do appear to be finding the silver lining in their arranged engagement. Unfortunately, she is soon under threat of execution, as Aoba turns on her, as he's <b>afraid</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> will eventually become a demon herself, like her mother and grandmother before her. Aoba shoots an arrow through her chest and Sakura falls into a river, only to be found by a cute and sassy young ninja named Kohaku and her childhood friend Hayate, who used to be human but was accidentally turned into a frog by Kohaku (although he regains his human form during the full moon). While with Kohaku, the two form a nice friendship, and Sakura reveals that she is being hunted by Kohaku's master, who just so happens to be Aoba. Kohaku though in return admits already knowing this, and tells that she doesn't wish to harm her, and wants to protect her. The two, along with Asagiri and Hayate, soon encounter Aoba and his men, and Volume 1 ends with Sakura being affected by a youko whistle that Aoba has.|$|E
