For two sovereign governments, we compare allocation choices that are either simultaneously or sequentially announced. We show sequential allocation announcements result in higher (lower) aggregate emissions when <b>announcements</b> <b>are</b> strategic substitutes (complements). Whether allocation <b>announcements</b> <b>are</b> strategic substitutes or complements depends {{on the relationship between}} the follower’s damage function and governments’ abatement costs. When the marginal damage function is relatively steep (flat), allocation <b>announcements</b> <b>are</b> strategic substitutes (complements). For quadratic abatement costs and damages, sequential announcements provide a higher level of aggregate emissions...|$|R

40|$|We {{draw on the}} {{investor}} protection literature to identify structural factors in the financial reporting environment {{that are likely to}} explain cross-country differences in the information content of annual earnings announcements. Using data from over 50, 000 annual earnings announcements in 26 countries, we find that annual earnings <b>announcements</b> <b>are</b> more informative in countries with higher quality earnings or better enforced insider trading laws, and that annual earnings <b>announcements</b> <b>are</b> less informative in countries with more frequent interim financial reporting. We also find that, on average, earnings <b>announcements</b> <b>are</b> more informative in countries with strong investor protection institutions. © 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Researchers have {{consistently}} {{shown that a}} firms repurchase <b>announcement</b> <b>is</b> met with positive abnormal stock price return reactions. Open-market repurchases are extremely flexible, non-committal and non-punitive; thus, it is puzzling that the mere announcement of an open-market repurchase will likely increase a firms stock price. I propose to disentangle a firms choice to repurchase its stock to determine when a repurchase <b>announcement</b> <b>is</b> good news for shareholders and when the <b>announcement</b> <b>is</b> not. I find {{that the purpose of}} the repurchase announcement matters. At the announcement date, managers intention of avoiding dilution is significantly negative and enhancing shareholder value is significantly positive, as expected...|$|R
