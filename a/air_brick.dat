This soil has a low bearing capacity and the water level is near the ground surface. The reinforced concrete structural skeleton of this building consists of a mat foundation and slabs joined by walls. The façades of the building are in <b>air</b> <b>brick</b> masonry. Instrumental devices to measure the settlements of the building were installed. To observe the behaviour of the developed cracks, a monitoring system was also applied. The water table was observed with piezometers. A tridimensional numerical linear-elastic analysis using a finite element computer program considering soil-structure interaction is done. The soil is modelled using springs distributed continuously and {{the values of the}} modulus of subgrade vertical reaction are estimated from the geotechnical properties. The numerical results reveal the deformations and the damages of the building. These results are compared with the field observations. A rehabilitation structural solution is analysed in order to decrease the differential settlements and the soil pressure, and sustain the crack development...|$|E

40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{optimize}} the envelope thermal design of free-running urban residential buildings in Malawi. It specifically set out to improve the urban residential buildings’ thermal comfort and suggest optimal envelope thermal design features for these buildings. The research study was primarily dependent on computer simulations in EnergyPlus to replicate the typical Malawian urban residential building’s thermal behaviour and then study the impacts of various envelope configurations on the thermal comfort conditions registered in the building. The simulation model was experimentally validated to check its appropriateness to the climatic design conditions prevalent in Malawi {{and out of the}} three major cities that were considered, the model was found to be appropriate for use in the two cities of Mzuzu and Lilongwe leaving out the city of Blantyre. The optimization methodology that was employed involved the use of orthogonal arrays, statistical analyses and the listing method. It was found that the optimal envelope thermal design, which registered up to 18 % lower discomfort hours than that of the typical urban residential building, consists of a 50 mm concrete floor slab, 230 mm burnt brick walls with an external layer of 19 mm EPS, tiled roof with an internal layer of sarking and 50 mm EPS, double Low-E Glazing with a transparency ratio of 45 % and 0. 2408 m 2 of adaptable operational surface area for the <b>air</b> <b>bricks.</b> Out of all the envelope features that were studied, air infiltration registered the most significant contribution towards the ultimate residential building thermal performance. It was demonstrated that controlled air infiltration through the use of operable <b>air</b> <b>bricks</b> whose operational surface area is adaptable can be very effective in enhancing the building’s comfort levels. It was further observed that excessive insulation of the building envelope generally has a detrimental effect on the indoor space thermal comfort levels...|$|R

50|$|A <b>brick</b> <b>air</b> raid shelter was {{constructed}} {{to the rear}} of the fire station during World War II. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in December 1941 stunned the Australian populous, and in the weeks and months which followed fear of air raids and invasion dominated Australian society. On Christmas Eve, 1941, instructions were issued in each State by the State Emergency Committee for government, private employers and private households to immediately commence with the building of shelters. In Brisbane, three distinct categories of surface shelters were constructed: pill box, cantilever and special/site specific. Most of the shelters surviving today are of cantilever construction as these were purposely designed and located for conversion to public waiting sheds and shade structures after the war. The air raid shelter at the Balmoral Fire Station is of the pill box form, constructed by the State Government for the use of the firemen manning the Station. It was built to shelter approximately six adults.|$|R

Production processes of bricks by artisans, and small- and medium-scale manufacturers are explained. Embodied energy of brick walls is also calculated and the key factors in the energy efficiency of brick kilns are discussed in detail. Low quality, high material waste and excessive energy waste during production and handling are highlighted as the major issues associate with traditional manufacturing processes of burned bricks in Uganda and Tanzania. The results reveal that small clamp kilns lose up to 3. 5 times more energy through their cooling surfaces compared to large kilns. The results also indicate that clamp fired bricks are up to 60 % more energy intensive than generic bricks and the embodied energy of artisan brick walls is 35 % more than standard brick walls with comparable thicknesses. Improving kiln construction and production methods, educating artisan producers, replanting tress, providing alternative renewable energy sources, and design improvements to control fire intensity and <b>air</b> circulation in <b>brick</b> kilns are some of the recommendations to improve the energy efficiency and mitigate the environmental impacts of fired bricks in East African countries...|$|R

40|$|Brick {{making in}} {{emerging}} and developing countries, using simple technologies without any abatement of emissions in place, is a sector that particularly gains importance when economies start to grow, with subsequently rising demands for construction materials. Traditionally, bricks are made using virgin biomass as a fuel. Apart from the overuse of {{resources in the}} vicinity of the kilns, the lack of traditional combustion material leads to the uncontrolled use of alternative fuels, often high caloric waste such as plastic material, waste oils etc. Consequently the releases of hazardous compounds may become an issue. Apart from that occupational health and - since the production sites are often part of settlement areas ¿ public health may be concerned. We present first results from a field campaign determining the emission of PCDD/Fs, dioxin- like PCBs and Hexachlorobenzene from <b>brick</b> production to <b>air,</b> ashes and <b>bricks.</b> The measurements were carried out in Mexico, in the province of Guanajuato, on kilns typically used in developing countries. In the State of Guanajuato there are 2170 brick kilns of that type registered. To investigate the influence of fuel, the selection comprised one kiln operated with traditional fuel (untreated wood trunks), the other one with waste- derived fuel (¿ Combustóleo¿, a type of heavy oil). The experiments were carried out in co-operation between the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC), who coordinated the project and analysed emission and ash samples, and the Centro Nacional de Investigación y Capacitación Ambiental (CENICA), Instituto Nacional de Ecología (INE), Mexico, who coordinated the field campaigns as part of a main project to evaluate the impact of artisanal brick kiln production 1. The data on PCDD/Fs, dioxin- like PCBs and Hexachlorobenzene in bricks were contributed from Krakow University. Gamatek (subcontracted by CENICA) executed the sampling of PCDD/Fs, dioxin- like PCBs and Hexachlorobenzene emissions, determined the content of CO 2, CO and CH 4 in the flue gas, and calculated the emission factors to air. The emission factors to waste (ashes) and products (bricks) were calculated by the JRC.
