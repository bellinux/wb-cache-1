40|$|Although {{crucial for}} their {{business}} and establishment in the market, many young and innovative internet companies face a decreased number of venture capital investments in 2009. To enter a market or expand in other markets, a company {{needs to be}} in a good financial condition. Especially in times of the economic downturn, the long-term potential of a business is decisive for investors.

2500|$|Babson College's Diana Report {{found that}} the number of women {{partners}} in VC firms decreased from 10% in 1999 to 6% in 2014. The report also found that 97% of VC-funded businesses had male chief executives, and that businesses with all-male teams were more than four times as likely to receive VC funding compared to teams with at least one woman. More than 75% of VC firms in the US did not have any female venture capitalists at the time they were surveyed. It was found that a greater fraction of VC firms had never had a woman represent them on the board of one of their portfolio companies. For comparison, a UC Davis study focusing on large public companies in California found 49.5% with at least one female board seat. When the latter results were published, some San Jose Mercury News readers dismissed the possibility that sexism was a cause.

2500|$|Kalanick {{received}} a letter, dated November 19, 2014, from U.S. Senator Al Franken, Chairman of the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law, over user privacy. In {{addition to a}} list of 10 questions, Franken stated that the company had a [...] "troubling disregard for customer privacy" [...] and that he was [...] "especially troubled because there appears to be evidence of practices inconsistent with the policy [...] Ms. Hourajian articulated" [...] and that [...] "it appears that on prior occasions your company [...] has condoned use of customers' data for questionable purposes." [...] Franken concluded his letter by asking for a response by December 15, 2014. Concerns have been raised about internal misuse of the company's data, in particular the ability of Uber staff to track the movements of its customers, known as [...] "God View". In addition to the aforementioned use of the service to track journalists and politicians, <b>a</b> <b>venture</b> <b>capitalist</b> disclosed in 2011 that Uber staff were using the function recreationally and viewed being tracked by Uber as a positive reflection on the subject's character. An individual who had interviewed for a job at Uber said that he was given unrestricted access to Uber's customer tracking function as part of the interview process, and that he retained that access for several hours after the interview ended. On February 27, 2015, Uber admitted that it had suffered a data breach more than nine months before. Driver names and license plate information on approximately 50,000 drivers were inadvertently disclosed. Uber discovered this leak in September 2014 but waited more than five months to notify the people affected.|$|E
