5|$|July 1940to October 1943: A {{total ban}} on <b>air</b> <b>operations,</b> and {{a release of}} interned German {{aircraft}} and pilots, resulting from the encirclement of Swiss territory by the Axis, {{the implementation of the}} Réduit strategy, and recognition that the Air Force would be overwhelmed by the Germans in a sustained campaign.|$|E
5|$|The {{most senior}} {{military}} officer in-country was the AIRA, the ambassador's air attaché, an Air Force colonel. The air attaché office originally consisted of that officer {{and six other}} personnel. The burgeoning air programs in Laos however, dictated the dispatch of 117 more Air Force personnel during 1966. The Air Force conducted its operations {{under the aegis of}} Project 404, whose mission was to support the Royal Laotian military, the clandestine Hmong army, and to support project personnel, who coordinated the operational end of covert activities in Laos. Eventually, five <b>air</b> <b>operations</b> centers were created in Laos – at Vientiane, Pakse, Savannakhet, Long Tieng, and Luang Prabang. These centers supported the ambassador with intelligence, administrative services, and communications as well as the actual <b>air</b> <b>operations</b> under a program called Palace Dog.|$|E
5|$|In June 1944, Kenney was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} Far East Air Forces (FEAF), which came to include the Fifth, Thirteenth, and Seventh Air Forces. He created the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Air Task Forces to control <b>air</b> <b>operations</b> in forward areas, each for a specific mission, another departure from doctrine. While Kenney was enthusiastic about this innovation, Washington did not like it and, over Kenney's objections, converted the three air task forces into the 308th, 309th and 310th Bombardment Wings. He was promoted to general on 9 March 1945.|$|E

5|$|In late 1941, Luftflotte 2 {{supported}} the final German offensive against Moscow, codenamed Operation Typhoon. Raids on Moscow proved hazardous, as Moscow had good all-weather airfields and opposition from both fighters and anti-aircraft guns {{was similar to}} that encountered over Britain. The bad weather that hampered ground operations from October on impeded <b>air</b> <b>operations</b> even more. Nonetheless, Luftflotte 2 continued to fly critical reconnaissance, interdiction, close air support and air supply missions.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{suspension}} of NATO flights, former US President Jimmy Carter personally negotiated a four-month ceasefire in Bosnia. Although there were some violations of this ceasefire, most of the parties in the conflict heeded it. NATO ordered its planes back in the air, but due to the diminished hostilities, they did not engage in any significant operations {{for the next several}} months. The reduced tensions resulting from the Carter ceasefire and the cessation of NATO <b>air</b> <b>operations</b> also led to the release of most of the UNPROFOR hostages over the next several weeks.|$|E
5|$|Shoup's {{opposition}} to the war only increased over time; he initially pushed for a negotiated settlement but later supported a unilateral pullout from the country. As the Vietnamization strategy took effect and the U.S. increased its <b>air</b> <b>operations,</b> he remained opposed to any strategy that risked a nuclear war with China or the Soviet Union. His criticism attracted more press as the war became a stalemate. It also became highly publicized through discourse among the anti-war movement.|$|E

While initial <b>air</b> <b>operations</b> went well, and the German {{fighters and}} bombers soon gained {{the upper hand}} against the small Dutch air force, the paratroopers ran into fierce opposition in the Battle for The Hague and the Battle of Rotterdam. On 14 May 1940, responding to a call for assistance from Student, Kesselring ordered the bombing of Rotterdam city centre. Fires raged out of control, destroying much of the city.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffe {{had been}} far from absent {{over the front}} in December. It flew several {{thousand}} sorties over the theatre. Its encounters with the RAF and USAAF had meant heavy losses in matériel and pilots. On the eight days of operations between 17 and 27 December 1944, 644 fighters were lost and 227 damaged. This resulted in 322 pilots killed, 23 captured and 133 wounded. On the three days of operations 23–25 December, 363 fighters were destroyed. None of the Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commanders) expected any large-scale <b>air</b> <b>operations</b> {{by the end of}} the month.|$|E
5|$|When deployed, the E-3 {{monitors}} an assigned area of {{the battlefield}} and provides information for commanders of <b>air</b> <b>operations</b> to gain and maintain control of the battle; while as an air defense asset, E-3s can detect, identify, and track airborne enemy forces far from {{the boundaries of the}} U.S. or NATO countries and can direct fighter-interceptor aircraft to these targets. In support of air-to-ground operations, the E-3 can provide direct information needed for interdiction, reconnaissance, airlift, and close-air support for friendly ground forces.|$|E

An <b>Air</b> <b>Operation</b> Center {{was established in}} each of Laos' five military regions, with the personnel being recruited via the U. S. Air Force's Palace Dog program. On both 1 and 2 August 1965, RLAF B Team T-28s struck North Vietnam; on the 18th, a T-28 on a similar raid was shot down, and cross border attacks by the RLAF were suspended.|$|R
5|$|A {{subsequent}} USAF investigation {{blamed the}} accident on several factors. The F-15 pilots were faulted for misidentifying the helicopters as hostile. Also, {{the crew members}} of the AWACS aircraft were blamed for their inaction in failing to exercise appropriate control and for not intervening in the situation. In addition, the {{identification friend or foe}} (IFF) systems had not functioned to identify the helicopters to the F-15 pilots. Furthermore, USAF leaders had failed to adequately integrate U.S. Army helicopter operations into overall OPC <b>air</b> <b>operations.</b> As a result of the investigation several USAF officers received administrative discipline but only one, Jim Wang, an AWACS crew member, was tried by military court-martial, in which he was acquitted.|$|E
5|$|As of 20April 1942, {{operational}} {{authority over}} all RAAF combat infrastructure, including area commands, was {{invested in the}} newly established Allied Air Forces (AAF) Headquarters under South West Pacific Area Command (SWPA). On 15May, Southern Area, which by then was considered too large, yielded responsibility for operational and maintenance units within New South Wales to a new area command, Eastern Area. Control of maintenance units under Southern Area {{was transferred to the}} newly established No.4 (Maintenance) Group in Melbourne on 14September. September also saw the formation of RAAF Command, led by Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock, to oversee the majority of Australian flying units in the SWPA. Bostock exercised control of <b>air</b> <b>operations</b> through the area commands, although RAAF Headquarters continued to hold overarching administrative authority over Australian units.|$|E
5|$|Hansell {{played a}} key and largely unsung role in the {{strategic}} planning of <b>air</b> <b>operations</b> by the United States. This included drafting both the strategic air war plans (AWPD-1 and AWPD-42) and the plan for the Combined Bomber Offensive in Europe; obtaining a base {{of operations for the}} B-29 Superfortress in the Mariana Islands; and devising the command structure of the Twentieth Air Force, the first global strategic air force and forerunner of the Strategic Air Command. He made precision air attack, as both the most humane and effective means of achieving military success, a lifelong personal crusade that eventually became the key tenet of American airpower employment.|$|E

50|$|In September 1994, the 1st Brigade of the 10th Mountain Division, which {{included}} 1-87 Infantry, conducted the Army's first <b>Air</b> Assault <b>operation</b> {{from the deck}} of a naval vessel, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69), in support of Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti. This was the Army's first <b>air</b> <b>operation</b> from a naval vessel since the Doolittle Raid of World War II.|$|R
5|$|Heated debate arose among Westmoreland, Commandant of the Marine Corps Leonard F. Chapman, Jr. and Army Chief of Staff Harold K. Johnson. Johnson {{backed the}} Marine {{position}} {{due to his}} concern over protecting the Army's air assets from Air Force co-option. Westmoreland was so obsessed with the tactical situation that he threatened to resign if his wishes were not obeyed. As a result, on 7 March, {{for the first time}} during the Vietnam War, <b>air</b> <b>operations</b> were placed under the control of a single manager. Westmoreland insisted for several months that the entire Tet Offensive was a diversion including, famously, attacks on downtown Saigon and obsessively affirming that the true objective of the North Vietnamese was Khe Sanh.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, Russia, for {{the first}} time in combat conditions, {{deployed}} four Su-35S planes to Khmeimim air base in Syria as part of Russian <b>air</b> <b>operations</b> in the country. This occurred following an increase in tension between Russia and Turkey as a result of reported incursions by Russian aircraft into Turkish airspace. The aircraft complemented the Su-30SMs in flying combat air patrols and providing protection to other aircraft that were conducting bombing missions. As a result of operations in Syria, problems were identified with the aircraft's avionics and were subsequently rectified. The aircraft presumably attained full operational capability in September 2017.|$|E
5|$|The Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair was not {{convinced}} when {{the class was}} being designed that aircraft could effectively substitute as armament for a warship, especially at night or in bad weather that would prevent <b>air</b> <b>operations.</b> Thus the carriers' design included a substantial gun battery of eight 55-caliber Mk 9 eight-inch guns in four twin gun turrets. These turrets were mounted above the flight deck on the starboard side, two before the superstructure, and two behind the funnel, numbered I to IV from bow to stern. In theory the guns could fire to both sides, but {{it is probable that}} firing them to port would have damaged the flight deck. They could be depressed to −5° and elevated to +41°.|$|E

5|$|The air {{wings of}} the USS Enterprise and USS Coral Sea, were ready to provide close air support and {{anti-aircraft}} suppression if required with their A-6 and A-7 attack aircraft, and would provide continuous fighter cover the evacuation route including by VF-1 and VF-2, flying from the Enterprise with the first combat deployment of the new F-14 Tomcat. USAF aircraft operating out of Nakhon Phanom Air Base, Korat Air Base and U-Tapao Air Base in Thailand were also overhead {{for the duration of}} the helicopter evacuation. A C-130 Airborne Command and Control controlled all US <b>air</b> <b>operations</b> over land. USAF F-4s, F-111s and A-7s provided air cover during daylight, being replaced by AC-130s from the 16th Special Operations Squadron at night. Strategic Air Command KC-135 tankers provided air-to-air refueling.|$|E
5|$|The {{consumption}} of aviation gasoline during combat and resupply operations {{was so great}} in the early phase of the war, taxing the very limited supply available in the Far East, that it {{became one of the}} more serious logistical problems facing UN planners. Ocean tankers could rarely keep pace with the rate of consumption. Although the situation never forced the UN to halt its <b>air</b> <b>operations,</b> on several occasion the situation became quite dire, and was only rectified by the rapid procurement of supplies from Japan. On a number of occasions throughout the war, the demand of military consumption had the effect of leaving Japanese gas stations with no fuel to sell to the public.|$|E
