50|$|Some jurisdictions use the {{warranty}} deed to transfer real property {{instead of the}} grant deed. The warranty deed adds the <b>additional</b> <b>guarantee</b> that the grantor will defend the title against any third-party claim.

50|$|As {{sophisticated}} technologies become widespread (and even subsidized) {{in emerging}} countries, sourcing {{of a wide}} range of products can be made at very low cost. These same products may have prices that allow for net margins to account up to several times the cost of the goods sold. Customers may be unaware of this business practice and may be paying higher prices for products that differ little from others with less famous brands. On the other hand, some companies do provide <b>additional</b> <b>guarantees</b> to these products offering better quality, customer support, and additional services.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the capital guarantees shown in the table, the enlarged EFSF agreement holds the guarantor countries responsible for all interest costs of the issued EFSF bonds, {{in contrast to the}} original EFSF structure, significantly expanding the potential taxpayer liabilities. These <b>additional</b> <b>guarantee</b> amounts increase if the coupon payments of the issued EFSF bonds are high. On 29 November 2011, European finance ministers decided that EFSF can guarantee 20 to 30% of the bonds of struggling peripheral economies.|$|R

50|$|The {{first article}} of the Wisconsin {{constitution}} outlines the legal rights of state citizens. In addition to reaffirming the rights guaranteed in the United States Bill of Rights, Article I of the Wisconsin Constitution offers <b>additional</b> <b>guarantees</b> to its citizens.

50|$|Access to information, just as media {{independence}} and pluralism remain critical {{issues in the}} Republic of Moldova. Despite numerous calls for media legislation reform, the government of Moldova has not made significant steps to improve access to information according to the country's international obligations, including a convention with the Council of Europe. Public officials widely impede access to public information through refusals, delays or incomplete answers, without sanctions. In 2014, the Independent Journalism Center (IJC) presented to Parliament amendments to improve the law on access to information, provide <b>additional</b> <b>guarantees</b> for journalists and limit unjustified limitations of access to public information by public officials. However, the draft law {{has not yet been}} adopted. According to the Executive Director of the Association of Independent Press, Petru Macovei, overall the law on access to information is good, but it is compromised by a non-collaborative attitude of the public authorities.|$|E

40|$|The subject. The {{article focuses}} {{on the need to}} improve {{legislative}} and law enforcement activities related to the consolidation of constituent entities of the Russian Federation <b>additional</b> <b>guarantees</b> of realization of constitutional human and civil rights and freedoms. The purpose of the article is to identify main ways of improvement the legal regulation <b>additional</b> <b>guarantees</b> of realization of constitutional human and civil rights and freedoms by the constituent entities of the Russian Federation. The methodology. The author uses a dialectical method, a method of analysis and synthesis, a formal legal method. The results and scope of application. The lack of unity in understanding the essence of <b>additional</b> <b>guarantees</b> of realization of rights and freedoms requires not only theoretical analysis of this legal category, but a consistent system of the legislation, and corresponding to the system of law enforcement practice. The legal establishment of the <b>additional</b> <b>guarantees</b> of realization of constitutional human and civil rights and freedoms, due solely to the will of the legislator of a constituent entitiy of the Russian Federation aimed at the concretization of constitutional rights and freedoms {{as well as of the}} security mechanisms (legal conditions, means) of the implementation of these rights. Features of development of the corresponding constituent entitiy of the Russian Federation should be taken into account. One of the main directions of improvement of legal regulation in this field is legislative recognition of <b>additional</b> <b>guarantees</b> of realization of constitutional human and civil rights and freedoms established by the constituent entities of the Russian Federation. This concept should be reflected in the Federal law of October 6, 1999 No. 184 -FZ "On General principles of organization of legislative (representative) and executive bodies of state power of constituent entities of the Russian Federation", as well as in the constitutions (charters) of constituent entities of the Russian Federation. The consolidation of this concept in the legislation will be the impetus to the theoretical analysis of this legal category, and will ultimately contribute to the improvement of the legal status of the individual. Conclusions. Improvement of regional legal policy in the sphere of establishment <b>additional</b> <b>guarantees</b> of realization of constitutional human and civil rights and freedoms by subjects of the Russian Federation has great practical significance and contributes to the theoretical knowledge of the specified legal category. </p...|$|E

50|$|Child life {{insurance}} {{is a form}} of permanent {{life insurance}} that insures the life of a minor. It is usually purchased to protect a family against the sudden and unexpected costs of a child’s funeral or burial and to secure inexpensive and guaranteed insurance for the lifetime of the child. It offers guaranteed growth of cash value, which some carriers allow to be withdrawn (collapsing the policy) when the child is in their early twenties. Child life insurance policies typically offer the owner the option to purchase, or in some cases obtain <b>additional</b> <b>guaranteed</b> insurance when the child reachesmaturity.|$|R
40|$|The door-closing {{process can}} {{reinforce}} {{the impression of}} a solid, rock-proof, car body or of a rather cheap, flimsy vehicle. As there are no real prototypes during rubber profile bidding-out stages, engineers need to carry out non-linear numerical simulations that involve complex phenomena as well as static and dynamic loads for several profile candidates. This paper presents a structured virtual design tool based on FEM, including constitutive laws and incompressibility constraints allowing to predict more realistically the final closing forces and even to estimate sealing overpressure as an <b>additional</b> <b>guarantee</b> of noise insulation.

In this paper, we present a methodology to generate <b>additional</b> <b>guarantees</b> given the limited set of guarantees in the design manual. In order to achieve this, we propose a multi-function optimization method to extract parame-ters of a preliminary dimension- and distance-based process correlation model for interconnects.

40|$|Abstract. Motivated by {{the problem}} of {{establishing}} a session key among parties based on the possession of certain credentials only, we discuss a notion of attribute-based key establishment. A number of new issues arise in this setting that are not present in the usual settings of group key establishment where unique user identities {{are assumed to be}} publicly available. After detailing the security model, we give a two-round solution in the random oracle model. As main technical tool we introduce a notion of attribute-based signcryption, which may be of independent interest. We show that the type of signcryption needed can be realized through the encrypt-then-sign paradigm. Further, we discuss <b>additional</b> <b>guarantees</b> of the proposed protocol, that can be interpreted in terms of deniability and privacy...|$|E

40|$|Replication is {{a popular}} {{technique}} for increasing data availability and improving perfor- mance in peer-to-peer systems. Maintaining freshness of replicated data is challenging due to {{the high cost of}} update management. While updates have been studied in structured networks, they have been neglected in unstructured networks. We therefore confront the problem of maintaining fresh replicas of data in unstructured peer-to-peer networks. We propose techniques that leverage path replication to support efficient lazy updates and provide freshness for cached data in these systems using only local knowledge. In addition, we show that locally available information may be used to provide <b>additional</b> <b>guarantees</b> of freshness at an acceptable cost to performance. Through performance simulations based on both synthetic and real-world workloads from big data environments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach...|$|E
