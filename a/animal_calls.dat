6000|$|... 'When {{a savage}} names himself after an <b>animal,</b> <b>calls</b> it his brother, {{and refuses to}} kill it, the animal {{is said to be}} his totem.' Distinguo! A savage does not name himself after his totem, any more than Mr. Frazer named himself by his clan-name, {{originally}} Norman. It was not as when Miss Betty Amory named herself 'Blanche,' by her own will and fantasy. A savage inherits his totem name, usually through the mother's side. The special animal which protects an individual savage (Zapotec, tona; Guatemalan, nagual; North America, Manitou, 'medicine') is not that savage's totem. {89a} The nagual, tona, or manitou is selected for each particular savage, at birth or puberty, in various ways: in America, North and Central, by a dream in a fast, or after a dream. ('Post-hypnotic suggestion.') But a savage is born to his kin-totem. A man is born a wolf of the Delawares, his totem is the wolf, he cannot help himself. But after, or in, his medicine fast and sleep, he may choose a dormouse or a squirrel for his manitou (tona, nagual) or private protecting animal. These are quite separate from totems, as Mr. Max Muller also points out.|$|E

50|$|Some {{researchers}} {{propose that}} an <b>animal</b> <b>calls</b> and other vocal behavior provide evidence as to consciousness.

50|$|During {{the early}} {{settlement}} of Australia by Europeans, {{the notion that}} the bunyip was an actual unknown animal that awaited discovery became common. Early European settlers, unfamiliar with {{the sights and sounds of}} the island continent's peculiar fauna, regarded the bunyip as one more strange Australian animal and sometimes attributed unfamiliar <b>animal</b> <b>calls</b> or cries to it. It has also been suggested that 19th-century bunyip lore was reinforced by imported European memories, such as that of the Irish Púca.|$|E
50|$|The {{distinctive}} {{sound of}} exotica {{relies on a}} variety of instruments: conga, bongos, vibes, Indonesian and Burmese gongs, boo bams (bamboo sticks), Tahitian log, Chinese bell tree and Japanese kotos. Additionally intrinsic to the sound of exotica are bird calls, big-cat roars, and even primate shrieks which invoke the dangers of the jungle. Though there are some standards which contain lyrics, singing is rare. Abstract, sirenish ululations, chants, vocalized <b>animal</b> <b>calls,</b> and guttural growls are common.|$|E
