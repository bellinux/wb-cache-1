5000|$|The steam wagon came in {{two basic}} forms. The overtype designs {{looked like a}} cross between <b>a</b> <b>traction</b> engine and <b>a</b> lorry. The front resembled <b>a</b> <b>traction</b> engine by having a cab built around a {{horizontal}} fire-tube boiler with a round smokebox and chimney (e.g. Foden). The back resembled a lorry in having a load-carrying body and being built around <b>a</b> chassis. (<b>A</b> <b>traction</b> engine is constructed around the boiler and has no separate chassis.) ...|$|R

50|$|These were {{designed}} to replace the 030 0-6-0 shunting engines. The 0-6-0 engines possessed <b>a</b> <b>traction</b> force of 40 tons, while the 0-8-0 {{were designed}} to have <b>a</b> <b>traction</b> force of 60 tons.

50|$|The {{campaign}} is also notable {{for the first}} recorded instance of <b>a</b> <b>traction</b> engine being employed on active service. Steam sapper number 8 (made by Aveling and Porter) was shipped out and assembled at Cape Coast Castle. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>traction</b> engine it had limited success hauling heavy loads up the beach, but gave good service when employed as a stationary engine driving a large circular saw.|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{angiogenesis}} did {{not occur}} with the film model method. A tendon gel is secreted only at the transition of cells from the tendon stump, and we consider this as an intrinsic healing process. Thus, we considered that this study evaluated the intrinsic healing of mouse Achilles tendons on days 10, 15, and 20 after surgery using the film model method. The results demonstrated that the application of <b>a</b> <b>traction</b> force to the tendon gel secreted from the transected tendon ends induces tendon regeneration on day 10, and that application of <b>a</b> <b>traction</b> force on or after day 15 results in the regeneration of the tendon that is more resilient to <b>a</b> <b>traction</b> force.|$|R

5000|$|<b>As</b> <b>traction</b> motors use <b>a</b> {{reduction}} gear setup to transfer torque from the motor armature to the driven axle, the actual load {{placed on the}} motor varies with the gear ratio. Otherwise [...] "identical" [...] traction motors can have significantly different load rating. <b>A</b> <b>traction</b> motor geared for freight use with a low gear ratio will safely produce higher torque at the wheels {{for a longer period}} at the same current level because the lower gears give the motor more mechanical advantage.|$|R
