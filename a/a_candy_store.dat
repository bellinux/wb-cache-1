5|$|Spring Street, {{a typical}} {{commercial}} 19th century corridor, {{is the primary}} roadway within the district. Most buildings along Spring Street are Italianate and eclectic Victorian. The structure vary between two and three stories tall, with brick as the most common building material. The 100 block is the closest to the Ohio River and has seen the most demolition. It contains the Old Strauss Hotel {{at the corner of}} Riverside Drive, a three-story Italianate hostelry with a corbeled cornice and arched windows. The buildings on the 200 block are mostly Italianate style buildings, the most notable being the old Elk's Club structure (a three-story highly decorated glazed brick building) and the Bensinger's Building (a 1920s commercial building of pressed brick and crenelated parapet). There is more diverse architecture on the 300-block, with a 19th-century Masonic Temple, the LaRose Theatre (a 1920s orange glazed brick structure with terra cotta trim), Horner's Novelty (which had to be rebuilt after the worst fire in Jeffersonville's history), and Schimpff's Confectionery, <b>a</b> <b>candy</b> <b>store</b> that opened in 1891 that now also features a small candy museum. More Italianate structures are on the 400 block, but its most important structure is the 1907 Citizens National Bank Building, which is stone Classical Revival with large eagles for adornment. The block also holds the regional office for the local Boy Scouts of America council. Warder Park is located {{on the east side of}} the 500 block and features a Classical Revival Masonic Temple that used for most of the 20th Century.|$|E

500|$|Adam LaClave and Paul Meany {{were the}} primary songwriters for Earthsuit. As Christians, the two wrote lyrics that often communicated a Christian message. For example, the song [...] "Said the Sun" [...] is an allegory about God telling Christians to be {{carriers}} of light. [...] "Whitehorse" [...] was written to present {{a different view of}} the return of Jesus, as LaClave stated in an interview, [...] "Most people, when they hear the term [...] "white horse," [...] think of the analogy of Jesus coming back ... wanted to bring a different meaning to it, because ... He comes to rescue us in our everyday life [...]" [...] The men's lyrics also reflect experiences they have had. Meany once had a dream that inspired him to write [...] "Gummy Buffalo"; he found himself in <b>a</b> <b>candy</b> <b>store</b> and squeezed a gummy buffalo whereupon he heard the melody for the song. Christianity Today has proposed the lyrics in [...] "Foreign" [...] may have been inspired by their departure from Sparrow Records. The lyrics read [...] "There's no place in your world for me / I've been from sea to shining sea / And I can't retain your policies, excuse me / If I'm just hanging around, I'm foreign." ...|$|E
500|$|Large {{quantities}} of two-cent pieces were withdrawn in the 1870s and after. Approximately 17,000,000 of the some 45,600,000 two-cent pieces issued had been repurchased by the Treasury as of 1909. Withdrawn pieces were melted and recoined into one-cent pieces. [...] A bill for a two-cent piece bearing {{the portrait of}} recently deceased former president Theodore Roosevelt passed the Senate in 1920 and was strongly recommended by a House committee but never enacted. Numismatist S.W. Freeman noted in 1954 that few alive could remember using a two-cent piece, {{but for those who}} did, it was often associated with spending it at <b>a</b> <b>candy</b> <b>store.</b> [...] He recalled that two cents would buy a quantity of sweets, as a dime did in Freeman's day, and, he feared, it would take a quarter to do in the future. Full legal tender status was granted the two-cent piece by the Coinage Act of 1965, long after the coin had passed from circulation, as it made all coins and currency of the United States good for all public and private debts without limit. Nevertheless, numismatist Jack White pointed out in a 1971 column that due to its short lifespan, the piece [...] "hardly got its two cents in".|$|E
2500|$|Darin's career {{took off}} with a songwriting partnership, formed in 1955 with Don Kirshner, whom he met at <b>a</b> <b>candy</b> <b>store</b> in Washington Heights.

2500|$|Seeking to musically express Raekwon's {{blend of}} Five Percenter creed and inner-city experience, {{producer}} RZA worked intensively on a polished sound, slower and more layered {{than that of}} Wu-Tang's previous efforts, using strings, piano loops and vocal samples from Kung Fu movies, and Mafia films. Due to Raekwon's storytelling, mobster-minded approach, the producer set up Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... to play like scenes in a crime movie. RZA has cited soul musician Isaac Hayes as an influence on his orchestral approach to several of the album's tracks. He also later revealed {{that several of the}} album's beats, such as [...] "Incarcerated Scarfaces," [...] were originally intended for Wu-Tang member GZA's Liquid Swords album, but because of Raekwon's timely writing approach, were used last minute for Cuban Linx. In regard to this, Raekwon clarified [...] "RZA's house was more or less like <b>a</b> <b>candy</b> <b>store.</b> You come in and have all kinds of shit to choose from. I would take stuff that I felt would suit my album correctly; others would take their own beats too. The beats were like a grab bag. If I came in and heard a beat that someone already claimed, then I just had to fall back. We almost never fought over beats or nothing. I'd tell RZA if I liked a certain beat, and he'd see if it would fit me or not." ...|$|E
