40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{resiliency}} of a pure limit order market by investigating the limit order book (bid and ask prices, spreads, depth and duration), order flow and transaction prices {{in a window}} of best limit updates and transactions around aggressive orders (orders that move prices). We find strong persistence in the submission of aggressive orders. Aggressive orders take place when spreads and depths are relatively low, and they induce bid and ask prices to be persistently different after the shock. Depth and spread remain also higher than just before the order, but do return to their initial level within 20 best limit updates after the shock. Relative to the sample average, depths stay around their mean before and after aggressive orders, whereas spreads return to their mean after about twenty best limit updates. The initial price impact of the <b>aggressive</b> <b>order</b> is partly reversed in the subsequent transactions. However, the <b>aggressive</b> <b>order</b> produces a long-term effect as prices show a tendency to return slowly {{to the price of}} the <b>aggressive</b> <b>order.</b> Copyright Springer 2005...|$|E
40|$|Those {{who write}} about the police have {{generally}} neglected the informal ways police officers handle situations involving troublesome persons. Trouble-some persons, including homeless and mentally disturbed people, prosti-tutes, juveniles, and people {{under the influence of}} alcohol or drugs, are not necessarily best handled by arrest. In fact the recent move by many police agencies to handle situations with either <b>aggressive</b> <b>order</b> maintenance or community policing may encourage officers to handle troublesome persons via informal methods. This article focuses on one such informal method: police-initiated transjurisdictional transport (PITT) of troublesome persons, or dumping. This article describes PITT, explores the literature for examples of it, describes some of its possible causes, and proposes three ways to con-trol PITT. We conclude with four research strategies for studying police dumping of troublesome persons...|$|E
40|$|The spot foreign {{exchange}} marketplaces are {{split into two}} types by their respective trading rules: markets with conventional resting orders versus markets with resting that orders that include optionality. This optionality {{is owned by the}} counterparty who placed the resting order and provides the option to refuse the <b>aggressive</b> <b>order</b> matched against the resting order. This paper describes and contrasts these two types of markets. A valuation method for these very short expiry options on the later marketplace is proposed. Appropriate historical volatility metrics are defined and applied for these uniquely short expiry timescales. These historical volatility and valuation methods are used to describe some historical intraday periods, and are applied to various trading scenarios. Unique behaviors driven by the value of these options are highlighted. The benefits and risks of trading on these markets are described in light of this valuation approach. The effects of various addition constraints on the liquidity providers for these optionality matching marketplaces are introduced. Through judicious timing of order placement and appropriate constraints on the behaviors of the liquidity providers on these markets, the result is shown to be tighter spreads, greater breath and depth of liquidity, and the high fill ratios than the more conventional non-optionality matching markets...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{resiliency}} of a pure limit order market for {{large and small}} capitalization stocks as well as stocks with different tick sizes. We explore the issue of resiliency by investigating the <b>order</b> flow around <b>aggressive</b> <b>orders</b> that move prices. The impact of <b>aggressive</b> <b>orders</b> is gauged in three complementary ways. First, {{we look at the}} order flow before and after <b>aggressive</b> <b>orders.</b> We find strong persistence in the submission of <b>aggressive</b> <b>orders.</b> It takes about 50 subsequent orders before the order flow returns to its unconditional pattern. Second, we describe and estimate the effect of <b>aggressive</b> <b>orders</b> on prices. The estimated price impact is realized immediately, i. e. there are no lagged price effects. However, due to correlated order flow, prices do move {{both before and after the}} submission of <b>aggressive</b> <b>orders.</b> As an explanatory variable, both aggressiveness and <b>order</b> size of <b>aggressive</b> <b>orders</b> are important in explaining price effects. Both firm size and tick size are important in explaining the variation of the impact of order aggressiveness. Small firms exhibit a larger price impact. A larger tick size implies somewhat larger price effects. ...|$|R
40|$|Dealers {{trading in}} a limit order market must choose both the order {{aggressiveness}} and the quantity for their orders. We empirically investigate how dealers jointly {{make these decisions}} in the foreign exchange market using a unique simultaneous equations model. The model uses an ordered probit model {{to account for the}} discrete nature of order aggressiveness and a censored regression model to capture the clustering of orders placed at the smallest available quantity, $ 1 million. We find evidence of a clear trade-off between order aggressiveness and quantity: more <b>aggressive</b> <b>orders</b> tend to be smaller in size. The increased competition (demand) suggested by increased depth on the same (opposite) side of the market leads to less (more) <b>aggressive</b> <b>orders</b> in smaller (larger) size. This holds for the depths at both the best and off-best prices, even though off-best depths are not observable to dealers. Exchange rates; Financial markets...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of {{increasing}} pre-trade transparency using data from the Taiwanese stock market which has experienced a gradual increase in transparency. Specifically, we analyze the influence of transparency on the order placement strategies of individual as well as institutional investors, and its effect on market performance. We find that as the pre-trade transparency increases, the percent of the most <b>aggressive</b> <b>orders</b> decreases significantly while that of the other inside-quote orders increases. Furthermore, the percent of the most conservative orders declines mildly for the institutional investors as market transparency enhances, while the opposite is true for individual investors. Our results indicate greater pre-trade transparency intensifies the competition in order placement strategy especially for institutional investors, {{at the same time it}} reduces the extreme orders placement of institutional investors. All investors get smarter in placing orders and reduce unnecessary high-cost orders when the market is more transparent. Compared with institutional investors, the individual investors seem to be more patient as order flow information is disclosed, suggesting liquidity providers are mainly individuals. The result of the intraday analysis shows that the intraday pattern of each order category does not change much as transparency increases, the intraday pattern of the more <b>aggressive</b> <b>orders</b> is U-shaped while that of the least <b>aggressive</b> <b>orders</b> is inverse J-shaped. Generally speaking, greater transparency increases price volatility, while it does not improve market liquidity or efficiency. Further cross-sectional analysis reveals that the gain in liquidity from increasing transparency is positively related with the number of individual investor’s trades in the stock...|$|R
40|$|Objectives To {{examine the}} impacts of broken windows {{policing}} at crime hot spots on fear of crime, ratings of police legitimacy and reports of collective efficacy among residents of targeted hot spots. Methods A block randomized experimental design with a police intervention targeting disorder delivered to 55 treatment street segments with {{an equal number of}} segments serving as controls. Main outcomes were measured using a panel survey of 371 persons living or working in these sites. Results The broken windows police intervention delivered to crime hot spots in this study had no significant impacts on fear of crime, police legitimacy, collective efficacy, or perceptions of crime or social disorder. Perceptions of physical disorder appear to have been modestly increased in the target areas. Conclusions The findings suggest that recent criticisms of hot spots policing approaches which focus on possible negative “backfire” effects for residents of the targeted areas may be overstated. The study shows that residents are not aware of, or much affected by, a three hour per week dosage of <b>aggressive</b> <b>order</b> maintenance policing on their blocks (in addition to routine police responses in these areas). Future research needs to replicate these findings focusing on varied target populations and types of crime hot spots, and examining different styles of hot spots policing. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Throughout the 1920 s, America {{was marked}} {{by a series of}} {{fundamental}} political, social and economic shifts that defined the decade. The rise of the Second Ku Klux Klan {{was just one of the}} many results of the underlying tensions produced by the radical changes of the period. This fervently patriotic and nativist organization has captivated onlookers and academics because of its peculiar customs and its mysterious resurgence following the First World War. Historians have thoroughly analysed this group’s ideology, and have presented detailed case studies of the growth and decline of individual chapters of this vast organization. The 1920 s Klan has been studied from practically every possible angle. However, researchers have neglected to study the order’s fraternal traditions and their relationship with other fraternities. This thesis hopes to address this oversight by offering a critical evaluation of the Ku Klux Klan’s role as a fraternity. This thesis will analyse how this order functioned as a fraternity, and how these traditions helped recruit followers to the movement. This study will also discuss how the Klan interacted with other fraternities, particularly the Freemasons. These two fraternities shared a complex relationship with elements of both cooperation and conflict, and their interactions will help us comprehend how the Ku Klux Klan managed to become the foremost fraternal movement of the 1920 s. This thesis will analyse a number of different aspects about the Ku Klux Klan, from their ideology and rituals to their sales methods and public relations campaign. This study hopes to re-evaluate a number of key assumptions about this group by critically assessing the Klan from a different perspective. By investigating the response of fraternities like the Freemasons to an intrusive and <b>aggressive</b> <b>order</b> like the Klan, we can gain a better understanding of how the nation as a whole perceived and reacted to this peculiar organization.

40|$|The {{shipping}} market {{had taken off}} in 2003 and {{had come to a}} hard landing after the Financial Crisis in 2008. The optimism in this period spurred an <b>aggressive</b> <b>order</b> book expansion as the demand for these ships exceeded the supply. From 2008 till now, the market tries to find its equilibrium but supply and demand are still far from level. This research gives insight in the current market situation for Panamax ships and hereby focusing on ocean going grain shipments. The study aims to script the changing supply and demand elements that determine the future growth prospects for the Panamax fleet. This research will be of high value to decision makers in shipping companies, cargo owners, shipbuilders, bankers, governments and many more. The {{reason for this is that}} all of these decisions makers want have a good view of where the market is heading and if smart decisions and investments can be made. The research is performed with the data filtered from the Clarkson Shipping Intelligence Network. Clarkson Shipping Intelligence Network is a well-known Internet database that provides raw data, market reports, time series and graphs counting around 100, 000 pages regarding any aspect of shipping. From here, all Panamax ship market information was filtered (number of ships, age profile, flag, conversions and many more). Next to this, important drivers of grain demand and grain supply were filtered from web-sources and matched with the drivers of Panamax ships to seek correlations. Surprisingly, no correlations were found between these drivers. On the other hand, the Panamax ship information was structured in such a way that graphs and tables could be made that led to the following conclusions. Future growth prospects are almost none existing and a recovery of the market in the short term (within one to two years) is highly unlikely. The consequence is a sharp decrease of new building orders of Panamax ships and shipyards are struggling for work. Meanwhile, scrap prices are skyrocketing thus indicating an enormous increase in activity on scrap yards. But these days, scrap yards are struggling more and more with environmental and health and safety issues than their fight for new work. In the end, the research that lies in front of you is on of the most up-to-date market report on Panamax ships with the focus on ocean going grain shipments with those ships. Once over, the importance of this research to managers cannot be understated. Business Schoo...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contributes to}} the on-going discussion {{about the role of}} informed trading in the formation of efficient security prices. In Chapter II, I examine the pre-announcement periods with the temporary increases in informed trading. The findings suggest that the market can detect the temporary changes in the information environment of a stock in these periods with the standard measures of information asymmetry. In Chapter III, I analyze how the increases in trading aggressiveness by informed and uninformed traders after earnings announcement releases impact the speed of price adjustment to its new equilibrium level. I find that an increased use of <b>aggressive</b> <b>orders</b> slows down the adjustment process, especially in the situations when the majority of <b>aggressive</b> <b>orders</b> are submitted by uninformed traders.

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{important}} yet little explored subject of the market impact of limit orders. Our analysis is based on a proprietary database of metaorders, that is, large orders that are split into smaller pieces. It is divided into two distinct parts: the first addresses the case of <b>aggressive</b> limit <b>orders</b> and the second, that of passive limit orders. For both order types, we confirm a square root temporary impact in the participation rate. In the case of <b>aggressive</b> <b>orders,</b> we also study the price relaxation {{after the end of the}} metaorder, and show that the long-term impact reaches a level of approximately two-thirds of the maximum impact. Finally, we propose a functional form for market impact given by σ (Q/V) ^ 0. 5, where σ and Q/V respectively stand for the volatility and the participation rate...|$|R

When we focus on specific situations characterized by higher probability of information-based trading, we find that <b>orders</b> are less <b>aggressive,</b> suggesting strategic behavior of informed traders. This conjecture is supported by a different response to changes in the investor’s information set and by a stronger price impact of less <b>aggressive</b> <b>orders...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} general {{framework}} {{to describe the}} impact of different events in the order book, that generalizes previous work {{on the impact of}} market orders. Two different modeling routes can be considered, which are equivalent when only market orders are taken into account. One model posits that each event type has a temporary impact (TIM). The "history dependent impact" model (HDIM), on the other hand, assumes that only price-changing events have a direct impact, itself modulated by the past history of all events through an "influence matrix" that measures how much, on average, an event of a given type affects the immediate impact of a price-changing event of the same sign in the future. We find in particular that <b>aggressive</b> market <b>orders</b> tend to reduce the impact of further <b>aggressive</b> market <b>orders</b> of the same sign (and increase the impact of <b>aggressive</b> market <b>orders</b> of opposite sign). We discuss the relative merits of TIM and HDIM, in particular concerning their ability to reproduce accurately the price diffusion pattern. We find that in spite of theoretical inconsistencies, TIM appears to fare better than HDIM when compared to empirical data. We ascribe this paradox to an uncontrolled approximation used to calibrate HDIMs, calling for further work on this issue. ...|$|R

We also find a sizable opportunity cost from the unexecuted portion of a limit order that more than offsets the benefit obtained from the partial fulfillment of the order. The total trading cost, which includes price impact and opportunity cost, is positively related to order size and stock price volatility, but negatively associated with firm size, stock price, and stock liquidity. The total trading cost has a U-shaped relation with order aggressiveness. Collectively, our study suggests that, to minimize the total trading cost, the optimal strategy is simply to use a limit order submitted at the best quote...|$|R
