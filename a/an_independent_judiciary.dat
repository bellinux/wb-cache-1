5|$|Other {{difficulties}} arose {{when the}} Empire's parliament, the General Assembly, opened in 1826. PedroI, {{along with a}} significant percentage of the legislature, argued for <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> <b>judiciary,</b> a popularly elected legislature and a government which would be led by the emperor who held broad executive powers and prerogatives. Others in parliament argued for a similar structure, only with a less influential role for the monarch and the legislative branch being dominant in policy and governance. The struggle over whether the government would be dominated by the emperor or by the parliament was carried over into debates from 1826 to 1831 on the establishment of the governmental and political structure. Unable to deal with the problems in both Brazil and Portugal simultaneously, the Emperor abdicated on behalf of his son, PedroII, on 7 April 1831 and immediately sailed for Europe to restore his daughter to her throne.|$|E
5|$|The SPC is {{the highest}} court for appeal and review, and it reports to the National Assembly, which {{controls}} the judiciary's budget and confirms the president's nominees to the SPC and SPP. The SPP issues arrest warrants, sometimes retroactively. Below the SPC are district and provincial people's courts, military tribunals, and administrative, economic and labor courts. The people's courts are the courts of first instance. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has military tribunals, which have the same rules as civil courts. Military judges and assessors are selected by the MOD and the SPC, but the SPC has supervisory responsibility. Although the constitution provides for independent judges and lay assessors (who lack administrative training), the United States Department of State maintains that Vietnam lacks <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> <b>judiciary,</b> {{in part because the}} Communist Party selects judges and vets them for political reliability. Moreover, the party seeks to influence the outcome of cases involving perceived threats to the state or the party's dominant position. In an effort to increase judicial independence, the government transferred local courts from the Ministry of Justice to the SPC in September 2002. However, the Department of State saw no evidence that the move actually achieved the stated goal. Vietnam's judiciary is also hampered by a shortage of lawyers and by rudimentary trial procedures. The death penalty often is imposed in cases of corruption and drug trafficking.|$|E

Various lower courts exist, though village chiefs and elders resolve most local disputes in rural areas.|$|E

25|$|Established uitlanders, {{including}} the mining magnates, wanted political, social, and economic {{control over their}} lives. These rights included a stable constitution, a fair franchise law, <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> <b>judiciary,</b> and a better educational system. The Boers, for their part, recognised that the more concessions they made to the uitlanders the greater the likelihood – with approximately 30,000 white male Boer voters and potentially 60,000 white male uitlanders – that their independent control of the Transvaal would be lost and the territory absorbed into the British Empire.|$|E
25|$|Upon declaring Gibraltar to be a Crown {{colony in}} 1830, The Crown {{established}} <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> <b>judiciary</b> and a Supreme Court of Justice.

The Oireachtas has a dominant directly elected lower house known as Dáil Éireann (Article 16) and an upper house Seanad Éireann (Article 18), which is partly appointed, partly indirectly elected and partly elected by a limited electorate. There is also <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> <b>judiciary</b> headed by the Supreme Court (Article 34).|$|E
25|$|Israeli law {{provides}} {{for the right to}} a fair trial and <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> <b>judiciary.</b> The 2005 US Department of State report on Israel notes that the courts sometimes ruled against the executive branch, including in some security cases. Human Rights Groups believe these requirements are generally respected. The system is adversarial and cases are decided by professional judges. Indigent defendants receive mandatory representation. Some areas of the country fall under the separate judicial jurisdiction of military courts. These courts are believed to be in alignment with Israel's other criminal courts on matters pertaining to civilians. Convictions in these courts cannot be based on confession alone.|$|E

25|$|Dato Seri Abdullah Ahmad Badawi freed Anwar, {{which was}} seen as a portent of a mild liberalisation. At the 2004 election, the National Front led by Abdullah had a massive victory, {{virtually}} wiping out the PAS and Keadilan, although the DAP recovered the seats it had lost in 1999. This victory {{was seen as}} the result mainly of Abdullah's personal popularity and the strong recovery of Malaysia’s economy, which has lifted the living standards of most Malaysians to almost first world standards, coupled with an ineffective opposition. The government's objective is for Malaysia to become a fully developed country by 2020 as expressed in Wawasan 2020. It leaves unanswered, however, the question of when and how Malaysia will acquire a first world political system (a multi-party democracy, a free press, <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> <b>judiciary</b> and the restoration of civil and political liberties) to go with its new economic maturity.|$|E

The creation of this complex system indicates the desire of the framers of the constitution for a society built upon the rule of law. Indeed, the constitution explicitly outlines the fundamental rights of individual citizens and groups (most notably freedom of speech) and guarantees the existence of <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> press free from government control or censorship.|$|R

However, instead of having a Royally appointed governor, it elected its own and it appointed its own judges.

25|$|Numerous {{human rights}} groups have publicized human rights issues in China that they {{consider}} the government to be mishandling, including: the death penalty (capital punishment), the one-child policy (which China had made exceptions for ethnic minorities prior to abolishing it in 2015), the political and legal status of Tibet, and neglect of {{freedom of the press}} in mainland China. Other areas of concern include the lack of legal recognition of human rights and the lack of <b>an</b> <b>independent</b> <b>judiciary,</b> rule of law, and due process. Further issues raised in regard to human rights include the severe lack of worker's rights (in particular the hukou system which restricts migrant labourers' freedom of movement), the absence of independent labour unions (which have since been changing), and allegations of discrimination against rural workers and ethnic minorities, as well as the lack of religious freedom rights groups have highlighted repression of the Christian, Tibetan Buddhist, and Falun Gong religious groups. Some Chinese activist groups are trying to expand these freedoms, including Human Rights in China, Chinese Human Rights Defenders, and the China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group. Chinese human rights attorneys who take on cases related to these issues, however, often face harassment, disbarment, and arrest.|$|E

In 1889, the Meiji Constitution was adopted in a move to strengthen Japan {{to the level of}} western nations, resulting in the first parliamentary system in Asia.

However judicial accountability can reinforce judicial independence as it could show that judges have proper reasons and rationales for arriving at a particular decision. While judges are not democratically accountable to the people, the key is for judges to achieve equilibrium between the two to ensure that justice is upheld.|$|R
