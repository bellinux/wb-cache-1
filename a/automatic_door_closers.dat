Whereas interior closers typically use hydraulics, storm <b>door</b> <b>closers</b> are more typically pneumatic, using air and springs to close the <b>door.</b> Storm <b>Door</b> <b>closers</b> generally have a small metal washer on the rod that is used to lock the closer in the open position when moving stuff in or out, but more recent models such as the Touch 'n Hold door closer have a button to actuate the hold open feature to make this process easier.|$|R

50|$|A manual {{door closer}} stores the energy {{used in the}} opening of the door in a {{compression}} or torsion spring and releases it to close the <b>door.</b> Some <b>closers</b> allow for adjustment of the strength of the spring, making it easier or more difficult to push the door open. To limit the speed at which the door closes, most <b>door</b> <b>closers</b> use hydraulic (oil-filled) dampers, although spring mechanisms may also be used for damping. Some closers incorporate a back-check facility which prevents the door from being opened too fast; this is useful for, for example, external doors where there is a danger of wind catching and blowing it open, something which could otherwise cause damage to the doorset and/or objects and/or people near it. The speed at which the door closer closes the door may be adjustable by up to three adjustment valves. These valves often adjust the sweep speed and the latch speed of the <b>door</b> and some <b>closers</b> are optioned with a delayed action valve. The latch speed is the speed that the door travels in the last third to 10 degrees as it closes and is often set fast so that the door can properly latch closed. The sweep speed is the speed which the door travels at along the first two thirds of its travel and is often set slower than the latch speed. For openings where a much longer close time is desired, one may opt for a delayed action closer. The delayed action valve slows the sweep speed dramatically for roughly {{the first half of the}} sweep range. <b>Door</b> <b>closers</b> which provide this two or three-stage action and close doors at a determined rate are called 'controlled' <b>door</b> <b>closers.</b>|$|R
