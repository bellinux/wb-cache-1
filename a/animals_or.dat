5|$|Historically, {{all living}} things were {{classified}} as either <b>animals</b> <b>or</b> plants and botany covered the study of all organisms not considered animals. Botanists examine both the internal functions and processes within plant organelles, cells, tissues, whole plants, plant populations and plant communities.

5|$|Large, heavy horses, {{weighing}} from , {{the ancestors}} of today's draught horses, were used, particularly in Europe, from the Middle Ages onward. They pulled heavy loads like supply wagons and were disposed to remain calm in battle. Some historians believe they may have carried the heaviest-armoured knights of the European Late Middle Ages, though others dispute this claim, indicating that the destrier, or knight's battle horse, was a medium-weight animal. It is also disputed whether the destrier class included draught <b>animals</b> <b>or</b> not. Breeds at the smaller end of the heavyweight category may have included {{the ancestors of}} the Percheron, agile for their size and physically able to manoeuvre in battle.|$|E
5|$|Like many mammals, {{elephants}} can {{contract and}} transmit diseases to humans, {{one of which}} is tuberculosis. , tuberculosis appears to be widespread among captive elephants in the US, and because the disease can spread through the air to infect both humans and other animals, it is a public health concern affecting circuses and zoos. In 2012, two elephants in Tete d'Or zoo, Lyon were diagnosed with the disease. Due to the threat of transmitting tuberculosis to other <b>animals</b> <b>or</b> visitors to the zoo, their euthanasia was initially ordered by city authorities but a court later overturned this decision. At an elephant sanctuary in Tennessee, a 54-year-old African elephant was considered to be the source of tuberculosis infections among eight workers.|$|E

5|$|Like other otters, the North American {{river otter}} {{lives in a}} holt, or den, {{constructed}} in the burrows of other <b>animals,</b> <b>or</b> in natural hollows, such as under a log or in river banks. An entrance, which may be under water or above ground, leads to a nest chamber lined with leaves, grass, moss, bark, and hair. Den sites include burrows dug by woodchucks (Marmota monax), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), nutria (Myocastor coypus), or beaver and muskrat lodges. River otters also may use hollow trees or logs, undercut banks, rock formations, backwater sloughs, and flood debris. The use of den and resting sites is chiefly opportunistic, although locations that provide protection and seclusion are preferred.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippopotamus}} {{is considered}} to be very aggressive and has frequently been reported as charging and attacking boats. Small boats can be capsized by hippos and passengers can be injured or killed by the <b>animals</b> <b>or</b> drown. In one case in Niger, a boat was capsized by a hippo and 13 people were killed. As hippopotamuses will often engage in raiding nearby crops if the opportunity arises, humans may also come in conflict with them on these occasions, with potential for fatalities on both sides.|$|E
5|$|The rampant and {{unsustainable}} hunting was {{not just}} financially motivated: it also had a more philosophical, fatalistic aspect. The conventional wisdom among New Zealand Europeans in the 19th century was that things colonial, whether they were plants, <b>animals</b> <b>or</b> people, were inferior to things European. It was widely assumed that the plants and animals of New Zealand's forest ecosystems would be quickly replaced by more vigorous and competitive European species. This assumption of inevitable doom led to a conclusion that the conservation of native biota was pointless and futile; Victorian collectors instead focused their efforts on acquiring a good range of specimens before the rare species disappeared altogether.|$|E

The NNR has taken steps to control entry to the fragile dunes and other areas important for their <b>animals</b> <b>or</b> plants because of the damage to sensitive habitats that could be caused by unrestricted access. The dunes are an essential natural defence against the projected rises in sea level along this vulnerable coast.|$|E

These specimens were identified at the Pacific Biological Station in Nanaimo, creating a list of eleven varieties of sea bottom invertebrates.|$|E
