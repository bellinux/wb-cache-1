5000|$|Basketball's newness {{had other}} ramifications, too. According to the Arbutus, [...] "The {{fact that the}} game has <b>been</b> <b>so</b> {{recently}} adopted as a college game, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> few experienced players in the university, prevented a general interest {{on the part of}} the student body." ...|$|R
50|$|Grant McDougall of Christie's said:It is {{the most}} {{comprehensive}} collection of memorabilia I’ve {{had the good fortune}} to catalogue.

5000|$|Lucia from Heroine TV {{said that}} this was another amazing episode: [...] "...this show just keeps getting better and better. Yes, I know that I say that every week, shut up. I was enthralled by every scene {{featuring}} Damon and Stefan together, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> many of them." ...|$|R

6000|$|Caroline spoke rather hurriedly, [...] "I wish we could, {{but you see}} papa is out so often, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> people {{staying here}} sometimes: and in London, papa is so late at the House--it is very unlucky, {{but it would not}} do, it is all so irregular." ...|$|E
60|$|N.B. It is not said, let {{him that}} standeth take heed, but him that thinketh he standeth.

50|$|The {{team have}} been relegated last season 2010/2011.

50|$|Starkad killed Hugleik {{and made}} the Irish flee. He then had the jugglers and mimes whipped and beaten, in order to humiliate them. Then the Danes brought Hugleik's riches out to Dublin to <b>be</b> {{publicly}} looted, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> much of it that none cared for its strict division.|$|R

[...] "Perhaps I miss our clear sunshine, but here {{everyone}} looks careworn in your dingy towns, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> poor.

The Admiral hates trouble, and scorns asking favours; <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> young men's claims to be {{attended}} to in the same way, that a friendship and energy, not very determined, is easily put by. What a happy creature William must be! I wish we could see him." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{worship of}} Shiva and Nandi can be trace to even Indus Valley Civilization time period. The famous 'Pasupati Seal' depicts a seated figure {{which is usually}} {{identified}} as Shiva <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> many bull seals were found in Mohenjo daro and Harappa that led to conclude the researchers {{it might be the}} origin of Bull - cum - Nandi worship.|$|R
5000|$|The Blondies {{were tough}} in the studio, real tough. None of them liked each other, except Chris <b>and</b> Debbie, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> much animosity. They were really, really {{juvenile}} {{in their approach}} to life—a classic New York underground rock band—and they didn't give a fuck about anything. They just wanted to have fun and didn't want to work too hard getting it.|$|R
50|$|Earth {{receives}} {{a steady stream}} of meteorites from Mars, but they come from relatively few original impactors, and transfer was more likely in the early Solar System. Also some life forms viable on both Mars and on Earth might be unable to survive transfer on a meteorite, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> far no direct evidence of any transfer of life from Mars to Earth in this way.|$|R

5000|$|At {{that stage}} <b>there</b> <b>were</b> very few {{farms in the}} district.

25|$|Michael Brodie of Brodie {{received}} a charter from Robert the Bruce confirming his lands of Brodie. The charter states that Brodie held his thanage of Brodie {{by the right}} of succession from his paternal ancestors.

5000|$|American Aftermath writes, [...] "Every {{single track}} tells its own story and could easily stand by itself, {{but when you}} put them all {{together}}, this becomes a magnum opus. Some bands spent their entire career {{trying to put together}} material this strong. The opening track 'Gooski's Ladder' sets a tone for the album that will leave you begging for more <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>so,</b> so much more... 10/10." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{is just as}} {{difficult}} to give a minute account of {{the governments of the}} different cantons of Switzerland, as it is to give an account of the different state governments of America. Each differs, in some respect, from all the others; <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> of them in both cases, as to make it a subject proper only for regular treatises. I shall therefore confine the remarks I have to make on this subject to a few general facts.|$|E
60|$|MRS TARLETON. Oh, {{it wasnt}} much fancy with me, dear: your father just wouldnt {{take no for}} an answer; and I was only too glad to be his wife instead of his shop-girl. Still, it's curious; but I had more choice than you in a way, because, you see, I was poor; <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> more poor men than rich ones that I might have had more of a pick, as you might say, if John hadnt suited me.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, Neil Young {{inducted}} McCartney {{into the}} Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and praised McCartney, saying: [...] "I loved that record because it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> simple. <b>And</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> {{much to see}} and to hear.

5000|$|Douglas Wolfe from TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode 4.2/5 {{and stated that}} [...] "Episodes like this <b>are</b> <b>so</b> welcome - when {{almost all of the}} cast gets a small but meaty role to play. ...

5000|$|Bayer {{had told}} one of the SNL writers about the Jacob character, which she had {{originated}} in her stand-up, but didn't write the first bar mitzvah sketch herself. About the character, she said: [...] "When I was in seventh grade, we had bar and bat mitzvahs every weekend, so I {{had a lot of}} experience with that kind of boy. I <b>was</b> bat mitzvahed, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> many awkward boys running around." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As if it {{were any}} {{pleasure}} to me to think ill of you," [...] said Mary, in a mournful tone. [...] "As {{if it were}} not very painful to me to see you an idle frivolous creature.

And with so much good in your disposition, Fred,--you might be worth a great deal." ...|$|E
60|$|On the 22d we had light head-winds. A {{little before}} noon we passed, with the {{assistance}} of our oars, the Paciencia Straits, the narrowest part of the channel between Batchian and Gilolo. These were well named by the early Portuguese navigators, as the currents are very strong, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> eddies, that even with a fair wind vessels are often quite unable to pass through them. In the afternoon a strong north wind (dead ahead) obliged us to anchor twice. At nigh it was calm, and we crept along slowly with our oars.|$|E

Nellie and I will have just the nicest kind of a time. I won't get lonesome, but if I should feel just tempted to, I'll think, Father {{is on his way}} home. He will soon be here.' And that would drive the lonesomeness away before it dared to show its face. Don't you worry, Mother Campbell." ...|$|E

25|$|In France, the National Assembly made {{radical changes}} in French laws, and on 26 August 1789, {{published}} the Declaration of the Rights of Man, declaring all men free and equal. The French Revolution shaped {{the course of}} the conflict in Saint-Domingue and was at first widely welcomed in the island. Wealthy whites saw it as an opportunity to gain independence from France, which would allow elite plantation-owners {{to take control of the}} island and create trade regulations that would further their own wealth <b>and</b> power. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> many twists <b>and</b> turns in the leadership in France, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> many complex events in Saint-Domingue, that various classes and parties changed their alignments many times. However, the Haitian Revolution quickly became a test of the ideology of the French Revolution, as it radicalized the slavery question and forced French leaders to recognize the full meaning of their revolution.|$|R
