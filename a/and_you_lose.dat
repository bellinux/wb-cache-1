25|$|Cross a brook, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> the King of England; but {{you have}} some comfort in coming again under his Majesty, though 'shorn of his beams,' {{and no more than}} Prince of Wales. Go to the north, and you find him dwindled to a Duke of Lancaster; turn to the west of that north, and he pops upon you in the humble {{character}} of Earl of Chester. Travel a few miles on, the Earl of Chester disappears, and the King surprises you again as Count Palatine of Lancaster. If you travel beyond Mount Edgecombe, you find him once more in his incognito, and he is Duke of Cornwall... every one of those Principalities has the apparatus of a Kingdom for the jurisdiction over a few private estates, and the formality and charge of the Exchequer of Great Britain for collecting the rents of a country squire. Cornwall is the best of them.|$|E
500|$|... "Revolver" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna, Carlos Battey, Steven Battey, Lil Wayne, Justin Franks and Brandon Kitchen, and {{produced}} by Madonna and DJ Frank E. In an interview with Hiphopupdate.com, Frank E recalled that {{he had gone to}} the recording session two hours before his scheduled meeting with Madonna to set up and give the audio files to the recording engineer, and he said that the ensuing wait was incredibly nerve-racking for him. After Madonna arrived, they recorded her vocals and the song was finished the next day. [...] Reminiscing about the session, he said: [...] "I will never forget the feeling of leaving that session after vocal producing Madonna, and thinking to myself, 'It can’t it really get any harder than this.' I've taken that mentality into every other session I've been in, and it's helped me make the session and song more of a success. Unfortunately, the mix sounded like crap and the song flopped, but hey, you win some <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> some." ...|$|E
500|$|Carey wrote [...] "Mine Again" [...] {{alongside}} producer James Poyser. The ballad has {{electronic keyboard}} notes, a rhythmic vinyl sound, and melodies from gospel and R genres. [...] "Stay the Night" [...] {{was produced by}} Carey and Kanye West, and samples a piano loop from Ramsey Lewis's 1971 cover version of [...] "Betcha by Golly, Wow". In the lyrics, the protagonist faces the dilemma of spending the night with an ex-lover, although he is in another relationship. [...] "Get Your Number" [...] samples the hook from British band Imagination's 1982 single [...] "Just an Illusion", and derives its production from [...] "'80s-esque synthesizers" [...] and computerized musical instruments. Lawrence Ferber from the Windy City Times described [...] "Shake It Off" [...] as a [...] "playful approach to bitterness—and, more specifically, a cheatin' bad apple", with lyrics such as [...] "I gotta shake you off / Just like a Calgon commercial". In an interview with Ferber, Carey described the track as her favorite from The Emancipation of Mimi: [...] "'Shake It Off' can apply to anything. Whatever personal dramas we go through, put that song on <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> the anxiety or intensity of the moment. I'll listen to that song when I've {{just come out of}} an annoying meeting. I gotta shake this off." [...] Editor Jon Pareles from The New York Times felt that the album follows a formula that was most apparent on [...] "Shake It Off": [...] "On this album, the verses stay in a narrow range, the choruses glide higher, and at the ends of some songs, Ms. Carey gives herself a few of her old sky-high notes as a background flourish." ...|$|E

500|$|In game seven at Yankee Stadium, the Red Sox held a 5–2 {{lead through}} seven innings {{due to an}} {{ineffective}} start by Roger Clemens, but the Yankees remained in the game because of three shutout innings of relief by Mike Mussina in his first career relief appearance. After Boston Red Sox starter Pedro Martínez gave up a run in the eighth, manager Grady Little visited the mound but elected to leave a tiring Martínez to complete the inning. Martínez then gave up a ground-rule double to Hideki Matsui, and Yankees catcher Jorge Posada blooped a double into center field that drove in two runners and tied the game. The game went into extra innings and {{in the bottom of}} the eleventh inning, leadoff hitter Aaron Boone, grandson of Ray Boone, a (retired) longtime scout with the Red Sox, hit a solo home run off of Tim Wakefield to left field, ending the game and the series, giving the Yankees their 39th American League pennant. The Long Island, New York, newspaper Newsday went to the press before the game was over, and thinking Boston would win the game, editorialized as to what was wrong with the Yankees, and why they had lost the ALCS to the Red Sox. In a postgame interview, Red Sox firstbaseman Kevin Millar described the emotions in the Red Sox locker room: [...] "It was like we were all back in high school, like we'd all just gotten beat in the state playoffs, and everyone was going to graduate.... When you're a teenager <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> the big football game, that's when you see guys cry uncontrollably. You don't [...] see that much at this level." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Shake It Off" [...] was {{met with}} {{generally}} positive reviews from music critics. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine picked [...] "Shake It Off" [...] as a top pick from the album. Michael Paoletta, writing for Billboard, gave the song a positive review, complimenting its lyrics, production and Carey's vocals. He concluded his review with his assurance that the song would be a success, writing [...] "After 'We Belong Together' {{brought her back to}} radio big time, 'Shake It Off' will take Carey's good fortune to the next step." [...] Some critics compared the song heavily to Usher's material from his 2004 album, Confessions. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine wrote [...] "Mariah too heavily bites on the styles of her successors: Usher by way of Dupri on 'Shake It Off'," [...] while Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK said the song was [...] "Usher-lite". Lawrence Ferber from the Windy City Times described [...] "Shake It Off" [...] as a [...] "standout" [...] track from the album. When discussing the track with Ferber, Carey described the song as her favorite from The Emancipation of Mimi: [...] "Shake it off can apply to anything. Whatever personal dramas we go through, put that song on <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> the anxiety or intensity of the moment. I'll listen to that song when I've just come out of an annoying meeting. I gotta shake this off." [...] While Todd Burns from Stylus Magazine described it as [...] "sultry", a writer from the Fort Worth Star-Telegram called it [...] "lyrically crude" [...] and [...] "ghetto". Similarly, The Michigan Dailys Chris Gaerig criticized Carey's [...] "airy vocals" [...] and wrote [...] "Carey sounds like a 13-year-old boy going through puberty, singing love songs to a grade school crush." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{negative}} reviews generally {{disliked the}} film's Cold War-period setting, using various adjectives {{to describe it}} such as [...] "stuffy", [...] "stiff", [...] "bor", [...] "oddly hollow", [...] "embalmed", [...] "truncated", and [...] "psychic suffocation". They cited the film's much-advertised reverence of the source material as a fault, referring to the story as [...] "trapped" [...] in a faithful representation of Alan Moore's graphic novel. [...] "Watchmen is a bore [...] It sinks {{under the weight of}} its reverence for the original," [...] wrote Philip Kennicott of The Washington Post. Devin Gordon wrote for Newsweek, [...] "That's the trouble with loyalty. Too little, and you alienate your core fans. Too much, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> everyone—and everything—else." [...] Owen Gleiberman's Entertainment Weekly review reads, [...] "Snyder treats each image with the same stuffy hermetic reverence. He doesn't move the camera or let the scenes breathe. He crams the film with bits and pieces, trapping his actors like bugs wriggling in the frame." [...] " [...] never pause to develop a vision of his own. The result is oddly hollow and disjointed; the actors moving stiffly from one overdetermined tableau to another," [...] said Noah Berlatsky of the Chicago Reader. David Edelstein of New York agrees: [...] "They've made the most reverent adaptation of a graphic novel ever. But this kind of reverence kills what it seeks to preserve. The movie is embalmed." [...] A reviewer in The Wall Street Journal wrote, [...] "Watching 'Watchmen' is the spiritual equivalent of being whacked on the skull for 163 minutes. The reverence is inert, the violence noxious, the mythology murky, the tone grandiose, the texture glutinous." [...] Donald Clarke of The Irish Times was similarly dismissive: [...] "Snyder, director of the unsubtle 300, has squinted hard at the source material {{and turned it into a}} colossal animated storyboard, augmented by indifferent performances and moronically obvious music cues." [...] The trade magazines Variety and The Hollywood Reporter were even less taken with the film. Variety's Justin Chang commented that, [...] "The movie is ultimately undone by its own reverence; there's simply no room for these characters and stories to breathe of their own accord, and even the most fastidiously replicated scenes can feel glib and truncated," [...] and Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter writing, [...] "The real disappointment is that the film does not transport an audience to another world, as 300 did. Nor does the third-rate Chandler-esque narration by Rorschach help...Looks like we have the first real flop of 2009." ...|$|E

2500|$|FIFA President Sepp Blatter {{took the}} unusual step of apologising to England and Mexico for the {{decisions}} that went against them, saying: [...] "Yesterday I spoke to the two federations directly concerned by referees' mistakes [...] I apologised to England and Mexico. The English said thank you and accepted that you can win some <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> some and the Mexicans bowed their head and accepted it." [...] Blatter also promised to re-open the discussion regarding devices which monitor possible goals and make that information immediately available to match officials, saying: [...] "We will naturally take on board the discussion on technology and have the first opportunity in July at the business meeting." [...] Blatter's call came less than four months after FIFA general secretary Jérôme Valcke said the door was closed on goal-line technology and video replays after a vote by the IFAB.|$|E
2500|$|... (A PT is {{a patrol}} torpedo boat and a bluejacket is an enlisted sailor.) These incidents, {{along with many other}} perfidious actions of the Japanese {{throughout}} the Pacific War, led to an American tendency to shoot the dead or wounded Japanese soldiers and those who were attempting to surrender and not take them as prisoners of war easily. Two Marines of Iwo Jima told cautionary tales. One confided: [...] "They always told you take prisoners but we had some bad experiences on Saipan taking prisoners, you take them and then as soon as they get behind the lines they drop grenades <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> a few more people. You get a little bit leery of taking prisoners when they are fighting to the death and so are you." [...] The other reported, [...] "Very few of them came out on their own; when they did, why, usually one in the front he'd come out with his hands up and one behind him, he'd come out with a grenade." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although he {{embarked}} on the Test leg of England's tour of Bangladesh in March 2010, Onions returned {{home with a}} back injury without playing a match. Alastair Cook, England captain on the tour, voiced his disappointment that Onions {{would not be able}} to play for England: [...] "He was a huge part of our plans and he still is, obviously, because of the way he bowled in South Africa, where he was unlucky not to take more wickets than he did. He bowled really well there, and I was expecting him come to these conditions and bowl well here as well." [...] The injury prevented Onions from playing most of the English cricket season. He also underwent surgery on his left knee to repair cartilage. Speaking of his disappointment at not being able to play for England, Onions said [...] "The last few months have been massively frustrating. When you've had a place in the team for a while <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>lose</b> it it's hugely disappointing and hurts a lot. Before the injury everything had been like a dream for me, all I ever wanted to do was play for England, but the last six months have been tough." [...] In April 2010 Wisden Cricketers' Almanack named him as one of its five cricketers of the year for 2009. Onions did not recover in time to play in the 2010–11 Ashes series. However he was named in England's 27-man performance squad the following March after recovering from surgery.|$|E

A wooden-faced high priest flicks a red india-rubber ball into a polished oaken bowl, at the bottom of which are holes, each bearing a number up to nine.
