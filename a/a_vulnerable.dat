Initially angry that he is still {{following}} her, the two realize {{that they have been}} caught up in a complicated affair - that Aslam, unbeknownst to Jasmine, works for Khan, and that Jasmine was the one he had been sent to pick up. Before either can speak, a car containing Rawal and his henchmen arrives at a distance. Rawal shoots Jasmine, having learned of her relationship with Khan and hoping that hurting her lure the gangster into <b>a</b> <b>vulnerable</b> position.|$|E
5|$|Following the First World War, it surged in {{popularity}} and {{was associated with}} Hollywood stars {{and members of the}} British Royal Family. Its numbers have dropped significantly since then, with the breed listed as <b>a</b> <b>Vulnerable</b> Native Breed by the Kennel Club; an all-time low was recorded in 2008 when only 43 puppies were registered in the United Kingdom. This decline has been blamed on an influx of foreign and designer breeds, and the Sealyham's reduced usefulness as a working dog.|$|E

It has been recorded from Australia, Europe, northern Asia, and North America. In Europe, it has been listed as <b>a</b> <b>vulnerable</b> species in the Red Data Lists of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany; Sweden lists it as being of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Since 1998, the mallard {{has been}} rated {{as a species}} of least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This is {{because it has a}} large range–more than 20,000km2 (7700mi2)–and because its {{population}} is increasing, rather than declining by 30% over ten years or three generations and thus is not warranted <b>a</b> <b>vulnerable</b> rating. Also, the population size of the mallard is very large.|$|E

5|$|The Field Spaniel is a {{medium-sized}} breed dog of the spaniel type. They were originally developed to be all-black show {{dogs in the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries and were unpopular for work as a hunting dog. However, during the mid-20th century they were redeveloped as a longer-legged dog that was more suitable {{to be used for}} field work. They are now considered to be a rare breed, and are registered as <b>a</b> <b>Vulnerable</b> Native Breed by The Kennel Club.|$|E
5|$|The Field Spaniel {{remains a}} rare breed, {{even in the}} UK. In 2009, a total of 51 dogs were {{registered}} with The Kennel Club {{and has been in}} steady decline since 2000. Out of all the Spaniel breeds registered with The Kennel Club, the Field Spaniel has the lowest numbered registered year on year, with only the Sussex Spaniel coming a close second with 60 registrations in 2009. This is compared to the English Springer Spaniel with 12,700 and the English Cocker Spaniel with 22,211 registrations in 2009 alone. In order to promote the breed, they have been registered as <b>a</b> <b>Vulnerable</b> Native Breed by The Kennel Club.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) classifies the impala as {{a species}} of least concern overall. The black-faced impala, however, is {{classified}} as <b>a</b> <b>vulnerable</b> species; as of 2008, fewer than 1,000 were estimated in the wild. Though there are no major threats {{to the survival of}} the common impala, poaching and natural calamities have significantly contributed to the decline of the black-faced impala. As of 2008, the population of the common impala has been estimated at around two million. According to some studies, translocation of the black-faced impala can be highly beneficial in its conservation.|$|E

5|$|The King Charles Spaniel is {{less popular}} than the Cavalier {{in both the}} UK and the US. In 2010, the Cavalier was the 23rd most popular breed, {{according}} to registration figures collected by the American Kennel Club, while the English Toy Spaniel was the 126th. In the UK, according to the Kennel Club, the Cavalier {{is the most popular}} breed in the Toy Group, with 8,154 puppies registered in 2010, compared to 199 registrations for King Charles Spaniels. Due to the low number of registrations, the King Charles was identified as <b>a</b> <b>Vulnerable</b> Native Breed by the Kennel Club in 2003 in an effort to help promote the breed.|$|E
5|$|The {{great white}} shark has no known natural predators other than, on very rare occasion, the killer whale. The {{great white shark}} is arguably the world's largest known extant macropredatory fish, {{and is one of}} the primary predators of marine mammals. It is also known to prey upon a variety of other marine animals, {{including}} fish and seabirds. It is the only known surviving species of its genus Carcharodon, and is ranked first in having the most recorded shark bite incidents on humans. The IUCN list the great white shark as <b>a</b> <b>vulnerable</b> species, while it is included in AppendixII of CITES.|$|E
5|$|The impala {{occurs in}} {{woodlands}} and sometimes {{on the interface}} (ecotone) between woodlands and savannahs; it inhabits places close to water. While the black-faced impala is confined to southwestern Angola and Kaokoland in northwestern Namibia, the common impala is widespread across its range and has been reintroduced in Gabon and southern Africa. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifies the impala as a species of least concern; the black-faced subspecies has been classified as <b>a</b> <b>vulnerable</b> species, with less than 1,000 individuals remaining in the wild as of 2008.|$|E

There are no breed specific health concerns, {{but they can be}} affected by spinal problems due to their elongated body and the breed is affected by canine cancer at a higher than average rate.|$|E
5|$|Amésqueta was {{extremely}} {{suspicious of the}} small canoes being supplied, knowing that the Itza had 30-man canoes; he was also aware that tricking enemies into small canoes was a favoured tactic among the lowland Maya to separate and kill Spanish intruders. He suspected that AjK'ixaw had betrayed them {{and that this was}} precisely what had happened to Díaz and his men. As nightfall approached, low on rations, in <b>a</b> <b>vulnerable</b> location and with no sign of Díaz and his men, Amésqueta retreated from the lakeshore and his men took up positions on a small hill nearby. In {{the early hours of the}} morning he ordered a retreat by moonlight, using just a few torches. They arrived back at Chakal on 25 March and from there retreated to San Pedro Mártir on 9 April, beset by worsening conditions, a hurricane, sickness and rumours of enemies. The battered expedition set up a base camp nine leagues (approximately 23.4miles or 37.7km) north of Mopan.|$|E
5|$|Chrysolina graminis and C. herbacea {{are similar}} in size and colour and may be {{confused}} in UK populations. Distinguishing the two species in the United Kingdom is particularly important as C. graminis is <b>a</b> <b>vulnerable</b> species whereas C. herbacea is much more common. This has previously led to the misidentification of C. herbacea as C. graminis. C. herbacea measures 7–11mm in length. It is coloured iridescent green on dorsal surface throughout. The punctuation on the pronotum and elytra is distinctly similar, unlike in C. graminis. There is a smooth lip running only half {{the length of the}} ventral edge of the elytra, whereas this lip runs the full length on C. graminis.|$|E
