5|$|The {{innermost}} cortical layer, the zona reticularis, lies directly {{adjacent to}} the medulla. It produces androgens, mainly dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S), and <b>androstenedione</b> (the precursor to testosterone) in humans. Its small cells form irregular cords and clusters, separated by capillaries and connective tissue. The cells contain relatively small quantities of cytoplasm and lipid droplets, and sometimes display brown lipofuscin pigment.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the risk}} factors for endometrial cancer involve high levels of estrogens. An {{estimated}} 40% of cases {{are thought to be}} related to obesity. In obesity, the excess of adipose tissue increases conversion of <b>androstenedione</b> into estrone, an estrogen. Higher levels of estrone in the blood causes less or no ovulation and exposes the endometrium to continuously high levels of estrogens. Obesity also causes less estrogen to be removed from the blood. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which also causes irregular or no ovulation, is associated with higher rates of endometrial cancer for the same reasons as obesity. Specifically, obesity, typeII diabetes, and insulin resistance are risk factors for TypeI endometrial cancer. Obesity increases the risk for endometrial cancer by 300–400%.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} the {{gestation}} period tends to vary greatly, though 110 days is {{the average length of}} time. In the final stages of pregnancy, dominant females provide their developing offspring with higher androgen levels than lower-ranking mothers do. The higher androgen levels the result of high concentrations of ovarian <b>androstenedione</b> are thought to be responsible for the extreme masculinization of female behavior and morphology. This has the effect of rendering the cubs of dominant females more aggressive and sexually active than those of lower ranking hyenas; high ranking male cubs will attempt to mount females earlier than lower ranking males. The average litter consists of two cubs, with three occasionally being reported. Males take no part in the raising of young. Giving birth is difficult for female hyenas, as the females give birth through their narrow clitoris, and spotted hyena cubs are the largest carnivoran young relative to their mothers' weight. During parturition, the clitoris ruptures in order to facilitate the passage of the young, and may take weeks to heal.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{two studies}} further pinpointed the {{responsible}} region to chromosome 11 and a 4.5-Mb covering chromosomal rearrangement. The scientists {{were able to}} show that the first genetic change happened 3.8 million years ago on the resident chromosome, when a part of it broke off and was reintroduced in the wrong direction. This inversion created the faeder allele. About 500,000 years ago another rare recombination event of faeder and resident allele in the very same inverted region lead to the satellite allele. The 4.5 Mb inversion covers 90 genes, {{one of them is the}} centromere coding gene N- CENPN-, which is located exactly at one of the inversion breakpoints. The inactivation of the gene has severe deleterious effects and pedigree data of a captive ruff colony suggests that the inversion is homozygous lethal. Over the course of the past 3.8 million years, further mutations have accumulated within the inversion i.e. three deletions ranging from 3.3 to 17.6 kb. Two of these deletions remove evolutionary highly conserved elements close to two genes- HSD17B2 and SDR42E1-both holding important roles in metabolism of steroid hormones. Hormone measurements around mating time showed that whereas residents have a sharp increase of testosterone, faeders and satellites only experience higher <b>androstenedione</b> levels, a substance which is considered an intermediate in testosterone biosynthesis. The authors conclude that one or more of the deletions act as a cis-acting regulatory mutation which is altering the expression of one or both genes and eventually contributes to the different male phenotypes and behaviour.|$|E
25|$|In females, {{synthesis}} of estrogens starts in theca interna {{cells in the}} ovary, by the {{synthesis of}} <b>androstenedione</b> from cholesterol. <b>Androstenedione</b> is a substance of weak androgenic activity which serves predominantly as a precursor for more potent androgens such as testosterone as well as estrogen. This compound crosses the basal membrane into the surrounding granulosa cells, where it is converted either immediately into estrone, or into testosterone and then estradiol in an additional step. The conversion of <b>androstenedione</b> to testosterone is catalyzed by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD), whereas the conversion of <b>androstenedione</b> and testosterone into estrone and estradiol, respectively is catalyzed by aromatase, enzymes which are both expressed in granulosa cells. In contrast, granulosa cells lack 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, whereas theca cells express these enzymes and 17β-HSD but lack aromatase. Hence, both granulosa and theca cells are essential {{for the production of}} estrogen in the ovaries.|$|E
25|$|<b>Androstenedione</b> (A4) is an {{androgenic}} steroid {{produced by}} the testes, adrenal cortex, and ovaries. While androstenediones are converted metabolically to testosterone and other androgens, {{they are also the}} parent structure of estrone. Use of <b>androstenedione</b> as an athletic or bodybuilding supplement has been banned by the International Olympic Committee, as well as other sporting organizations.|$|E
25|$|Levels of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, <b>androstenedione,</b> and {{cortisol}} {{may play}} a role in screening.|$|E
25|$|Metabolites of DHEA include DHEA-S, 7α-hydroxy-DHEA, 7β-hydroxy-DHEA, 7-keto-DHEA, 7α-hydroxyepiandrosterone, and 7β-hydroxyepiandrosterone, {{as well as}} androstenediol and <b>androstenedione.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{expected}} second 17,20-lyase reaction (17α-hydroxyprogesterone → <b>androstenedione)</b> {{is mediated}} so inefficiently in humans {{as to be}} of no known significance.|$|E
25|$|The inner most {{cortical}} layer, the zona reticularis produces androgens, mainly dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S), and <b>androstenedione</b> (the {{precursor to}} testosterone) in humans.|$|E
25|$|It {{was after}} this {{accomplishment}} that McGwire {{and a wide}} array of MLB players came under scrutiny for use of steroids. A news reporter stumbled upon an open container of <b>androstenedione</b> in McGwire's locker in August of the '98 season. At the time <b>androstenedione</b> was not on the banned substance list for Major League Baseball, but was viewed as a precursor to anabolic steroids and was already banned by the International Olympic Committee, the National Football League, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association.|$|E
25|$|Estradiol is {{produced}} especially within the follicles {{of the female}} ovaries, but also in other endocrine (i.e., hormone-producing) and nonendocrine tissues (e.g., including fat, liver, adrenal, breast, and neural tissues). Estradiol is biosynthesized from cholesterol {{through a series of}} chemical intermediates. One principal pathway involves the generation of <b>androstenedione,</b> which is converted into estrone by aromatase and then by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase into estradiol. Alternatively, <b>androstenedione</b> can be converted into testosterone, an androgen and the primary male sex hormone, which in turn can be aromatized into estradiol.|$|E
25|$|Because 11β-hydroxylase {{activity}} {{is not necessary}} {{in the production of}} sex steroids (androgens and estrogens), the hyperplastic adrenal cortex produces excessive amounts of DHEA, <b>androstenedione,</b> and especially testosterone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Androstenedione</b> (Andro): an {{androgenic}} steroid {{produced by}} the testes, adrenal cortex, and ovaries. While androstenediones are converted metabolically to testosterone and other androgens, {{they are also the}} parent structure of estrone.|$|E
25|$|Like other steroid hormones, {{testosterone}} {{is derived}} from cholesterol (see figure). The {{first step in the}} biosynthesis involves the oxidative cleavage of the side-chain of cholesterol by cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc, CYP11A1), a mitochondrial cytochrome P450 oxidase with the loss of six carbon atoms to give pregnenolone. In the next step, two additional carbon atoms are removed by the CYP17A1 (17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase) enzyme in the endoplasmic reticulum to yield a variety of C19 steroids. In addition, the 3β-hydroxyl group is oxidized by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to produce <b>androstenedione.</b> In the final and rate limiting step, the C17 keto group <b>androstenedione</b> is reduced by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to yield testosterone.|$|E
25|$|Since 21-hydroxylase {{activity}} {{is not involved}} in synthesis of androgens, a substantial fraction of the large amounts of 17α-hydroxypregnenolone is diverted to synthesis of DHEA, <b>androstenedione,</b> and testosterone beginning in the third month of fetal life in both sexes.|$|E
25|$|DHEA, {{also known}} as androst-5-en-3β-ol-17-one, is a {{naturally}} occurring androstane steroid and a 17-ketosteroid. It is closely related structurally to androstenediol (androst-5-ene-3β,17β-diol), <b>androstenedione</b> (androst-4-ene-3,17-dione), and testosterone (androst-4-en-17β-ol-3-one). DHEA is the 5-dehydro analogue of epiandrosterone (5α-androstan-3β-ol-17-one) and is {{also known as}} 5-dehydroepiandrosterone or as δ5-epiandrosterone.|$|E
25|$|At a {{high dosage}} of 1,600mg/day orally for 4weeks, {{treatment}} of postmenopausal women with prasterone {{has been found}} to increase serum levels of DHEA by 15-fold, testosterone by 9-fold, DHEA-S, <b>androstenedione</b> (A4), and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) all by 20-fold, and estrone and estradiol both by 2-fold.|$|E
25|$|Prasterone, {{also known}} as androst-5-en-3β-ol-17-one, is a {{naturally}} occurring androstane steroid and a 17-ketosteroid. It is closely related structurally to androstenediol (androst-5-ene-3β,17β-diol), <b>androstenedione</b> (androst-4-ene-3,17-dione), and testosterone (androst-4-en-17β-ol-3-one). Prasterone is the 5-dehydro analogue of epiandrosterone (5α-androstan-3β-ol-17-one) and is {{also known as}} 5-dehydroepiandrosterone or as δ5-epiandrosterone.|$|E
25|$|Adipose tissue {{possesses}} aromatase, {{an enzyme}} that converts <b>androstenedione</b> to estrone and testosterone to estradiol. The excess of adipose tissue in obese women creates {{the paradox of}} having both excess androgens (which are responsible for hirsutism and virilization) and estrogens (which inhibits FSH via negative feedback).|$|E
25|$|Adrenal androgens are steroids {{produced}} by the zona reticulosa of the adrenal cortex in both sexes. The major adrenal androgens are dehydroepiandrosterone, <b>androstenedione</b> (which are precursors of testosterone), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate which is present in large amounts in the blood. Adrenal androgens contribute to the androgenic events of early puberty in girls.|$|E
25|$|The main {{subset of}} androgens, known as adrenal androgens, is {{composed}} of 19-carbon steroids synthesized in the zona reticularis, the innermost layer of the adrenal cortex. Adrenal androgens function as weak steroids (though some are precursors), and the subset includes dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), <b>androstenedione</b> (A4), and androstenediol (A5).|$|E
25|$|Although {{progesterone}} {{does not}} bind {{directly to the}} AR, it is a precursor and intermediate in the biosynthesis of androgens from cholesterol. For this reason, {{there has been some}} speculation that exogenous progesterone could be transformed into androgens by certain tissues that express the requisite enzymes. Progesterone is converted by 17α-hydroxylase into 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone is converted by 17,20-lyase into <b>androstenedione,</b> and <b>androstenedione</b> is converted by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases into testosterone. CYP17A1, the cytochrome P450 gene that encodes 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, is expressed mainly in the gonads (ovaries and testes) and the adrenal glands. Despite the reasoning that progesterone could be converted into androgens however, clinical studies in which women were treated with 100 to 300mg/day OMP have found no or only a small increase in levels of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and no change in androgen levels, including those of dehydroepiandrosterone, <b>androstenedione,</b> and testosterone. In these studies, levels of estradiol and cortisol, which progesterone is also a precursor of, did not change either, although levels of 11-deoxycorticosterone did increase significantly. In accordance with the lack of changes in androgen levels, progesterone, unlike various progestins, has not been associated with androgenic effects in clinical studies, including changes in the blood lipid profile or sex hormone-binding globulin levels, acne, skin oiliness, hirsutism, or voice deepening, or induction of teratogenicity (i.e., virilization of female fetuses).|$|E
25|$|Other {{endogenous}} estrogens, the biosyntheses {{of which}} do not involve aromatase, include 27-hydroxycholesterol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 7-oxo-DHEA, 7α-hydroxy-DHEA, 16α-hydroxy-DHEA, 7β-hydroxyepiandrosterone, <b>androstenedione</b> (A4), androstenediol (A5), 3α-androstanediol, and 3β-androstanediol, and may have important endogenous functions as estrogens. Some estrogen metabolites, such as the catechol estrogens 2-hydroxyestradiol, 2-hydroxyestrone, 4-hydroxyestradiol, and 4-hydroxyestrone, as well as 16α-hydroxyestrone, are also estrogens {{with varying degrees of}} activity.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the sudden fall in estradiol during menopause, the levels of total and free testosterone, as well as dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and <b>androstenedione</b> appear to decline more or less steadily with age. An effect of natural menopause on circulating androgen levels has not been observed. Thus specific tissue effects of natural menopause cannot be attributed to loss of androgenic hormone production.|$|E
25|$|In a 1998 {{article by}} Associated Press writer Steve Wilstein, McGwire confessed to taking <b>androstenedione,</b> an {{over-the-counter}} muscle enhancement product {{that had already}} been banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency, the NFL, and the IOC. At the time, however, use of the substance was not prohibited by Major League Baseball and it was not federally classified as an anabolic steroid in the United States until 2004.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone is {{observed}} in most vertebrates. Testosterone and the classical nuclear androgen receptor {{first appeared in}} gnathostomes (jawed vertebrates). Agnathans (jawless vertebrates) such as lampreys don't produce testosterone but instead use <b>androstenedione</b> as a male sex hormone. Fish make a slightly different form called 11-ketotestosterone. Its counterpart in insects is ecdysone. The presence of these ubiquitous steroids {{in a wide range}} of animals suggest that sex hormones have an ancient evolutionary history.|$|E
25|$|Persistently {{increased}} {{blood levels}} of estrogen are {{associated with an increased}} risk of breast cancer, as are increased levels of the androgens <b>androstenedione</b> and testosterone (which can be directly converted by aromatase to the estrogens estrone and estradiol, respectively). Increased {{blood levels of}} progesterone are associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer in premenopausal women. A number of circumstances which increase exposure to endogenous estrogens including not having children, delaying first childbirth, not breastfeeding, early menarche (the first menstrual period) and late menopause are suspected of increasing lifetime risk for developing breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|DHEA {{and other}} adrenal androgens such as <b>androstenedione,</b> {{although}} relatively weak androgens, {{are responsible for}} the androgenic effects of adrenarche, such as early pubic and axillary hair growth, adult-type body odor, increased oiliness of hair and skin, and mild acne. Women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), who have a non-functional androgen receptor (AR) and are immune to the androgenic effects of DHEA and other androgens, have absent or only sparse/scanty pubic and axillary hair and body hair in general, demonstrating the role of DHEA, testosterone, and other androgens in body hair development at both adrenarche and pubarche.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to conjugation and the 17-ketosteroid pathway, testosterone {{can also be}} hydroxylated and oxidized in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. 6β-Hydroxylation {{and to a lesser}} extent 16β-hydroxylation are the major transformations. The 6β-hydroxylation of testosterone is catalyzed mainly by CYP3A4 {{and to a lesser extent}} CYP3A5 and is responsible for 75 to 80% of cytochrome P450-mediated testosterone metabolism. In {{addition to}} 6β- and 16β-hydroxytestosterone, 1β-, 2α/β-, 11β-, and 15β-hydroxytestosterone are also formed as minor metabolites. Certain cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 can also oxidize testosterone at the C17 position to form <b>androstenedione.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the hepatic 17-ketosteroid pathway of {{testosterone}} metabolism, testosterone is converted {{in the liver}} by 5α-reductase and 5β-reductase into 5α-DHT and the inactive 5β-DHT, respectively. Then, 5α-DHT and 5β-DHT are converted by 3α-HSD into 3α,5α-androstanediol and 3α,5β-androstanediol, respectively. Subsequently, 3α,5α-androstanediol and 3α,5β-androstanediol are converted by 17β-HSD into androsterone and etiocholanolone, which is followed by their conjugation and excretion. 3β,5α-Androstanediol and 3β,5β-androstanediol can also be formed in this pathway when 5α-DHT and 5β-DHT are acted upon by 3β-HSD instead of 3α-HSD, respectively, and they can then be transformed into epiandrosterone and epietiocholanolone, respectively. A small portion of approximately 3% {{of testosterone}} is reversibly converted in the liver into <b>androstenedione</b> by 17β-HSD.|$|E
25|$|Serum (blood) {{levels of}} androgens (hormones {{associated}} with male development), including <b>androstenedione</b> and testosterone may be elevated. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels above 700–800µg/dL are highly suggestive of adrenal dysfunction because DHEA-S is made exclusively by the adrenal glands. The free testosterone level {{is thought to}} be the best measure, with ~60% of PCOS patients demonstrating supranormal levels. The Free androgen index (FAI) of the ratio of testosterone to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is high and is meant to be a predictor of free testosterone, but is a poor parameter for this and is no better than testosterone alone as a marker for PCOS, possibly because FAI is correlated with the degree of obesity.|$|E
25|$|However, both Bonds' {{accomplishments in}} the 2000s {{have not been}} without controversy. During his run, journalists {{questioned}} McGwire about {{his use of the}} steroid-precursor <b>androstenedione,</b> and in March 2005 was unforthcoming when questioned as part of a Congressional inquiry into steroids. Bonds has also been dogged by allegations of steroid use and his involvement in the BALCO drugs scandal, as his personal trainer Greg Anderson pleaded guilty to supplying steroids (without naming Bonds as a recipient). Neither Bonds nor McGwire has failed a drug test at any time since there was no steroid-testing until 2003 after the new August 7, 2002 agreement between owners and players was reached. McGwire retired after the 2001 season; in 2010, he admitted to having used steroids throughout his MLB career.|$|E
25|$|The {{three major}} {{naturally}} occurring estrogens in women are estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), and estriol (E3). Estradiol is the predominant estrogen during reproductive years {{both in terms}} of absolute serum levels as well as in terms of estrogenic activity. During menopause, estrone is the predominant circulating estrogen and during pregnancy estriol is the predominant circulating estrogen in terms of serum levels. Though estriol is the most plentiful of the three estrogens it is also the weakest, whereas estradiol is the strongest with a potency of approximately 80 times that of estriol. Thus, estradiol is the most important estrogen in non-pregnant females who are between the menarche and menopause stages of life. However, during pregnancy this role shifts to estriol, and in postmenopausal women estrone becomes the primary form of estrogen in the body. Another type of estrogen called estetrol (E4) is produced only during pregnancy. All of the different forms of estrogen are synthesized from androgens, specifically testosterone and <b>androstenedione,</b> by the enzyme aromatase.|$|E
25|$|The year 2000 {{began with}} Jones easily beating the hard-punching David Telesco via a 12-round {{decision}} on January 15, at Radio City Music Hall to retain his titles. Jones reportedly fractured his wrist {{a few weeks}} before this fight and fought almost exclusively one-handed. He entered the ring surrounded by the famous group of dancers, The Rockettes. His next fight was also a first time boxing event for a venue, as he traveled to Indianapolis and retained his title with an 11-round technical knockout over Richard Hall at the Conseco Fieldhouse. A post fight drug test showed that both Jones and Hall tested positive for <b>androstenedione</b> which was available legally over the counter at that time but banned by the IBF. The results of Jones' next two drug tests, which were negative, were sent to the Indiana Boxing Commission. The IBF chose not to take any action against Jones or Hall. Jones ended the year with a 10-round stoppage of undefeated Eric Harding in New Orleans.|$|E
25|$|Non-17α-alkylated {{testosterone}} derivatives such as testosterone itself, DHT, and nandrolone {{all have}} poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and hence are not orally active. A notable {{exception to this}} are AAS that are androgen precursors or prohormones, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenediol, <b>androstenedione,</b> boldione (androstadienedione), bolandiol (norandrostenediol), bolandione (norandrostenedione), dienedione, mentabolan (MENT dione, trestione), and methoxydienone (methoxygonadiene) (although these are relatively weak AAS). AAS that are not orally active are used almost exclusively {{in the form of}} esters administered by intramuscular injection, which act as depots and function as long-acting prodrugs. Examples include testosterone, as testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, and testosterone propionate, and nandrolone, as nandrolone phenylpropionate and nandrolone decanoate, among many others (see here for a full list of testosterone and nandrolone esters). An exception is the very long-chain ester testosterone undecanoate, which is orally active, albeit with only very low oral bioavailability (approximately 3%). In contrast to most other AAS, 17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives show resistance to metabolism due to steric hindrance and are orally active, though they may be esterified and administered via intramuscular injection as well.|$|E
