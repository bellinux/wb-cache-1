5|$|Although Z. Marcas {{features}} {{characters from}} other Balzac stories and elements of literary realism– both hallmarks of Balzac's style– it is remembered primarily for its political themes. Balzac, a legitimist, believed that France's lack of bold leadership {{had led to}} mediocrity <b>and</b> <b>ruin,</b> and that men of quality were being ignored or worse. He maintained that the youth of France {{were in danger of}} being abandoned by the government, and predicted unrest in the years to come.|$|E

He suggests that Cú Chulainn should train in arms with the renowned warrior-woman Scáthach {{in the land of}} Alba (Scotland), hoping the ordeal will be too much for him and he will be killed. Cú Chulainn takes up the challenge, travelling to her residence Dún Scáith (Fortress of Shadows) on the Isle of Skye. In the meantime, Forgall offers Emer to Lugaid mac Nóis, a king of Munster, but when he hears that Emer loves Cú Chulainn, Lugaid refuses her hand.|$|E

5|$|The bad {{economic}} times had continued, and strengthened {{the hand of}} forces for free silver. The issue bitterly divided the Democratic Party; President Cleveland firmly supported the gold standard, but {{an increasing number of}} rural Democrats wanted silver, especially in the South and West. The silverites took control of the 1896 Democratic National Convention and chose William Jennings Bryan for president; he had electrified the delegates with his Cross of Gold speech. Bryan's financial radicalism shocked bankers—they thought his inflationary program would bankrupt the railroads <b>and</b> <b>ruin</b> the economy. Hanna approached them for support for his strategy to win the election, and they gave $3.5 million for speakers and over 200million pamphlets advocating the Republican position on the money and tariff questions.|$|E
5|$|The hill {{stands at}} a {{strategic}} location overlooking {{the point where the}} River Tone and the old course of the River Cary join the River Parrett. Although there is some evidence of Roman visitation, the first fortification of the site was the construction of a Norman motte. It has been called King Alfred's Fort, however there is no proof of use by Alfred the Great. A medieval church was built on the hill in the 15th century. The current ruined church on top of the hill was built in 1793. The land <b>and</b> <b>ruin</b> were donated to the National Trust in 1946 as a war memorial.|$|E

5|$|The {{music for}} each {{game in the}} Myst series has fallen to various composers. Originally, the Millers {{believed}} that any music or sound besides ambient noise would distract the player from the game <b>and</b> <b>ruin</b> the sense of reality; Myst, therefore, was to have no music at all. A sound test eventually persuaded the developers that music heightened the sense of immersion rather than lessening it, and as such Robyn Miller composed 40 minutes of synthesized music for the game. He would also produce the music for Riven, which featured leitmotifs {{for each of the}} main characters. Virgin Records bought the rights to the music and produced the soundtracks, which were released in 1998.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} script {{called for}} Michael to tell Andy about Angela's affair {{outside in the}} parking lot before getting into his car and driving away. When filming began, Holland considered filming the scene inside the car instead. Steve Carell suggested Michael get in the car and leave Andy outside, then tell him while driving away, which was how the scene was ultimately shot. During a scene when Andy returns to the office and confronts his co-workers; there is a long, awkward silence, and the script originally called for Kevin to pass gas <b>and</b> <b>ruin</b> the tension. During filming, it was changed so Phyllis would pass gas instead because it was decided it would be funnier if it were a woman. During the editing process, Holland decided the joke did not work very well and cut it, but a brief moment of Dwight reacting in a disgusted way to the flatulence, while maintaining a defensive fighting pose toward Andy, can still be seen in the finished episode.|$|E
5|$|The two {{exchange}} wits; Jessica requests that Dain {{send her}} brother back to England {{in exchange for}} a valuable religious icon she will sell him, while Dain wants the icon or else he will destroy her reputation <b>and</b> <b>ruin</b> her brother. They reach an impasse, and while her reputation remains intact, Dain spends the week personally overseeing Bertie's disintegration from excessive drinking and gambling. Jessica angrily confronts him and the two unexpectedly kiss. Later, at a party they almost consummate their relationship before being discovered by other party-goers. Dain coldly departs, assuming Jessica invited the others to force him to honorably marry her, leaving her angry that he would leave her reputation in tatters so casually.|$|E

5|$|Kratos {{falls into}} the River Styx, where he loses the Blade of Olympus; {{the souls of the}} Underworld weaken him <b>and</b> <b>ruin</b> the Blades of Athena. Climbing from the river, he is confronted by the spirit of Athena, who had {{previously}} sacrificed herself to save Zeus from Kratos. She tells Kratos that her sacrifice has brought her to a higher existence, and she now sees truths she did not see before. She states that as long as Zeus reigns, there is no hope for mankind. She gives him the Blades of Exile and says that to kill Zeus, he must quench the Flame of Olympus. After finding the three Judges of the Underworld and the Chain of Balance, Kratos encounters the spirit of Pandora, whom he mistakes for his dead daughter, Calliope. Refusing to help the child, he continues his quest.

He severs her arm, causing her to fall from Mount Olympus to her apparent death.|$|E
