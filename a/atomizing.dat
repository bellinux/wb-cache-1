25|$|High-quality {{compound}} fertilizers containing nitrogen co-granulated {{with other}} components such as phosphates {{have been produced}} routinely since {{the beginnings of the}} modern fertilizer industry, but on account of the low melting point and hygroscopic nature of urea it took courage to apply the same kind of technology to granulate urea on its own. But {{at the end of the}} 1970s three companies began to develop fluidized-bed granulation. The first in the field was Nederlandse Stikstof Maatschappij, which later became part of Hydro Agri (now Yara International). Yara eventually sold this technology to Uhde GmbH, whose Uhde Fertilizer Technology (UFT) subsidiary now markets it. Around the same time Toyo Engineering Corporation developed its spouted-bed process, comprising a fluidized bed deliberately agitated to produce turbulent ebullation. Stamicarbon also undertook development work on its own fluidized-bed granulation system, using film sprays rather than <b>atomizing</b> sprays to introduce the urea melt, but shelved it until the 1990s, when there was for a time considerable doubt about the commercial future of the Hydro (UFT) process. As a result, the Stamicarbon technology is now commercialized and highly successful. More recently, Urea Casale introduced a different fluidized-bed granulation system: the urea is sprayed in laterally from the side walls of the granulator instead of from the bottom. This organizes the bed into two cylindrical masses contrarotating on parallel longitudinal axes. The raw product is uniform enough to not require screens.|$|E

2500|$|The fuel {{injector}} {{is responsible for}} introducing fuel to the combustion zone and, along with the swirler (above), is responsible for mixing the fuel and air. There are four primary types of {{fuel injector}}s; pressure-atomizing, air blast, vaporizing, and premix/prevaporizing injectors. Pressure <b>atomizing</b> fuel injectors rely on high fuel pressures (as much as [...] ) to atomize the fuel. This type of fuel injector {{has the advantage of}} being very simple, but it has several disadvantages. The fuel system must be robust enough to withstand such high pressures, and the fuel tends to be heterogeneously atomized, resulting in incomplete or uneven combustion which has more pollutants and smoke.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{construction}} {{there were}} concerns that during construction the sea bed would be disturbed, dislodging World War II-era naval mines and toxic materials including mines, chemical waste, chemical munitions {{and other items}} dumped in the Baltic Sea in the past decades, and thereby toxic substances could surface from the seabed damaging the Baltic's particularly sensitive ecosystem. [...] Swedish Environment Minister Andreas Carlgren demanded that the environmental analysis should include alternative ways of taking the pipeline across the Baltic, as the pipeline is projected to be passing through areas considered environmentally problematic and risky. [...] Sweden's three opposition parties called for {{an examination of the}} possibility of rerouting the pipeline onto dry land. Finnish environmental groups campaigned to consider the more southern route, claiming that the sea bed is flatter and so construction would be more straightforward, and therefore potentially less disruptive to waste, including dioxins and dioxin-like compounds, littered on the sea bed. [...] Latvian president Valdis Zatlers said that Nord Stream was environmentally hazardous as, unlike the North Sea, there is no such water circulation in the Baltic Sea. [...] Ene Ergma, Speaker of the Riigikogu (Parliament of Estonia), warned that the pipeline work rips a canal in the seabed which will demand leveling the sand that lies along the way, <b>atomizing</b> volcanic formations and disposing of fill along the bottom of the sea, altering sea currents.|$|E

Coarse and fine SS 316 L water <b>atomized</b> powder {{is mixed with}} a composite binder consisting of PMMA and PEG to form a homogenous paste, termed as feedstock. The feedstock is loaded with SS 316 L water <b>atomized</b> powder ranging 62 v/o, 62. 5 v/o, 63 v/o, 63. 5 v/o and 64 v/o. However, due to the morphology of the water <b>atomized</b> powder which is not spherical compared to the gas <b>atomized</b> ones, fine powder feedstock is unable to produce any significant rheological result due to the powder loading being more than 63. 5 v/o. Results show that the fine powder feedstock demonstrates a higher viscosity if compared to the coarse powder feedstock. It can be established that binder separations are {{likely to occur in}} the coarse powder feedstock, especially, at high temperatures. The investigation concludes that the fine powder feedstock has its best rheological properties at 62 v/o while the coarse powder feedstock lies between 63 v/o and 63. 5 v/...|$|R

50|$|External mix nozzles {{contacts}} fluids {{outside the}} nozzle {{as shown in}} the schematic diagram. This type of spray nozzle may require more <b>atomizing</b> air and a higher <b>atomizing</b> air pressure drop because the mixing and atomization of liquid takes place outside the nozzle. The liquid pressure drop is lower for this type of nozzle, sometimes drawing liquid into the nozzle due to the suction caused by the <b>atomizing</b> air nozzles (siphon nozzle). If the liquid to be atomized contains solids an external mix atomizer may be preferred. This spray may be shaped to produce different spray patterns.

40|$|Two {{problems}} are researched, {{one is that}} the existing results did not reveal the essence factor that determines the <b>atomized</b> property of cloud model; the other one is that error of backward cloud model with uncertainty is relatively large. Through the analysis of the normal cloud model, it is pointed out that standard deviation of the cloud droplet quantitative data determines the <b>atomized</b> property of cloud model, and the ratio of entropy and hyper entropy, known as the <b>atomized</b> factor, is proposed to measure degree of dispersion of droplet. The analysis and experiment results show that the range of <b>atomized</b> factor corresponded to cloud distribution is from 3 to 18; when it is greater than 18, cloud distribution will reduce to normal distribution, and backward cloud model with uncertainty is no longer applicable. And then, the four order origin moment of cloud distribution is used to estimate the characteristics of cloud model, thus presenting a new algorithm of backward cloud model with uncertainty.
