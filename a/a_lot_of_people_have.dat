Rory Cashin of State wrote that the song sounds like [...] "she is rapping while throwing furniture down the stairs". Hardeep Phull of the New York Post noted that the insulting nature of the song [...] "will leave {{the rest of us}} snickering like tennagers".

500|$|Jeremy Medina of Entertainment Weekly said he {{believed}} although the show initially needed improvement, that it had arrived at a [...] "settled and focused" [...] series with [...] "The Banquet". He praised the episode as a whole, {{as well as individual}} small moments, like Leslie's haircut, April calling her [...] "sir", Ron's affinity for bacon-wrapped shrimp, Tom's coining of the phrase [...] "peacockin" [...] to mean standing out in bars. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said [...] "The Banquet" [...] was funnier than other recent Parks and Recreation episodes, although he said the Leslie character continues to too closely resemble a female Michael Scott, the protagonist of The Office. Sepinwall said of the show, [...] "I know <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> already given up, but I really feel like the show is a summer's worth of tweaking away from being good. It's not there yet, but I see glimmers." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> told me this record has been for them.|$|E
500|$|Kiersten Warren also {{returned}} to the series as Nora Huntington after being introduced {{at the end of}} the second season. On her storyline, Warren commented, [...] "There's a lot of families who are going through this. Not quite the surprise ooh, boo, child, but children from other marriages and trying to meld these families. I think <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> to deal with it. I think it's fantastic that they’re doing this on the show." [...] Dougray Scott made his debut in this episode as Ian Hainsworth, Susan's romantic interest. Cherry opined that the character [...] "can legitimately rival Mike for [...] affections." [...] Daily commented on the storyline, saying: [...] "Talk about dark comedy — we're trying to find the humor in these two people bonding over the fact that they each have a partner in a coma."

500|$|... "Harvest Festival" [...] was {{the first}} episode of the season written and {{produced}} separately from the second season. The previous six episodes from the third season were filmed almost immediately after the second season ended {{as part of an}} early shooting schedule to accommodate Poehler's pregnancy. Series co-creator Michael Schur described it as a particularly empowering episode for the Leslie Knope character: [...] "When you see this episode [...] it makes you love her even more. This episode is about Leslie being noticed for the incredible hard work she does." [...] Schur also said he believed the subplot with April and Andy was one that several young people in their situation have faced in real life: [...] "Andy is put into a situation that <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been put into in our lives and he does the exact wrong thing you can do. And that's sort of the template for them going forward is what's the wrongest thing you can do? That's sort of how we follow them." [...] Chris Pratt said he believed the conflict provided strong romantic and comedic potential for the characters: [...] "There definitely will be conflict in their relationship [...] there's still {{a lot of room for}} comedy in there, because we have good writers." ...|$|E
500|$|The plot of [...] "The Bob Next Door" [...] {{is based}} on the movie Face/Off. The opening couch gag also {{features}} Harold from [...] the 1955 children's book Harold and the Purple Crayon. Bart tries to tempt Walt to sing [...] "Three Little Maids from School Are We" [...] from The Mikado; the same song was also used in an earlier episode, [...] "Cape Feare", which also featured Sideshow Bob. Later in the show, when Sideshow Bob reveals his true identity, he exclaims he is now [...] "able to sing all the Gilbert & Sullivan I damn well please", followed by him pulling a Japanese fan out of the glove box and singing the opening notes of [...] "Behold The Lord High Executioner", another number from The Mikado, to Bart's horror. Marge and Homer tell Bart that <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> voices like Sideshow Bob's, such as [...] "Frasier on Cheers, Frasier on Frasier or Lt. Cmdr. Tom Dodge in Down Periscope." [...] Both of these characters were played by Sideshow Bob's voice, Kelsey Grammer.

500|$|When {{speaking}} on the conceptual basis of Ready, Songz said, [...] "You think about a record like 'LOL Smiley Face,' it's something real simple, {{but when you look}} at the title or listen to the record, you're like, 'Wow.' That's something great from a songwriter's perspective. I'm just trying to make hits and classic records that people can vibe to and live their life." [...] In an interview with BallerStatus, Songz commented on his thoughts of making a remix of the song, stating, [...] "I think there's going to be a remix for that song, because a lot of people dig it. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> hit me up actually about it. That song is blowing up real fast man." [...] He also stated the possibility of American rapper Nicki Minaj appearing on a remix, saying, [...] "She wanted to do more of a commercial record, a cuter sex record. 'LOL' was actually already done, but when she heard it, she hit me up, and said 'I love that song. You're a punk for not putting me on it.' She'll definitely be on the remix." [...] However no remix was seen to be in the works nor did it come to fruition.|$|E

500|$|Mays has deemed Emma an [...] "amazing" [...] {{character}} to play, and has explained: [...] "I don't find that female characters are always written {{with a lot}} of depth, but she's so well defined on the page. Sure, she's terrified of germs and in love with a married man, so seeing her as the voice of reason for the kids is amazing." [...] Emma's relationship with Will will continue to grow, as [...] "she has these moments of clarity when she's talking to Will because he calms her." [...] Mays described her in an interview with TheTVChick: [...] "She is a romantic at heart. But she’s practical. She’s very interesting, because she does have those dreams and hopes of finding the right man. And in her mind, even though Will Schuester’s married, that sort of guy is like the perfect guy for her. She’s very practical in the fact that she doesn’t want to be alone and she knows that she’s somewhat limited in a small town to men. And Ken Tanaka is a very nice man, he’s not exactly like Will, but he’s good to her and he’s solid. He’s got a job, and he understands her and he understands all her quirks and stuff. So she’s practical, she knows that just might be her lot in life. So it’s weird. She’s got this very dreamy side about her and who she wants to be and what she wants her life to be like. But she’s also got this very practical, down-to-earth, well this is kind of the best I can do thing. It’s funny <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> thought that part about her is weak. Like a weak character flaw, but I actually don’t think that’s true. I really just think that’s the practical side of her. I think that’s her being practical. And I {{think a lot of people}} are like that sometimes." ...|$|E

2500|$|As Archbishop for the Military Services, O'Brien {{has been}} an outspoken proponent of the Just war theory.

Early 2003, O'Brien preached to the soldiers at West Point saying openly at mass : [...] "I know that <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> said that the Pope is against war with Iraq...

2500|$|The {{album was}} titled War for several reasons; in 1982, Bono said, [...] "War {{seemed to be}} the motif for 1982," [...] adding that [...] "Everywhere you looked, from the Falklands to the Middle East and South Africa, there was war. By calling the album War we're giving people {{a slap in the face}} and at the same time getting away from the cosy image <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> of U2." [...] The Edge said that [...] "It's a heavy title. It's blunt. It's not {{something}} that's safe, so it could backfire. It's the sort of subject matter that people can really take a dislike to. But we wanted to take a more dangerous course, fly a bit closer to the wind, so I think the title is appropriate." [...] The boy on the cover is Peter Rowen (brother of Bono's friend, Guggi). He also appears on the covers of Boy, Three, The Best of 1980–1990, Early Demos and many singles. Bono described the reasoning behind the cover: [...] "Instead of putting tanks and guns on the cover, we've put a child's face. War can also be a mental thing, an emotional thing between loves. It doesn't have to be a physical thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{newspaper}} highlighted {{four factors}} driving {{the opposition to}} the mosque: a dislike of immigrants, a fear that Christianity was losing its grip on a Bible Belt heartland, a [...] "swell of fear and hatred" [...] prompted by terrorist attacks, and the insecurity of the worst economic climate since the Great Depression. In past slumps, Chinese immigrants had been ostracized for being non-Christians, Catholics had been ostracized for being [...] "the wrong kind of Christians", and this time Muslims were suffering the brunt of prejudice. Rabbi Rami Shapiro noted that [...] "Muslims are in the way of God's plan" [...] for some anti-Muslim Christian Zionists, who believe that Muslims in Iran and Iraq will be forced out of their homes by Israeli expansion that will pave the way for the Second Coming of Jesus. Professor Ron Messier, who teaches Islamic studies and lives in Murfreesboro, commented: [...] "It's happened because this is an election year and I think there were some political candidates who thought that, here in Middle Tennessee, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> very right leanings and they could gain some political leverage by promoting fear about people who have been here for 20 years or more without ever being an issue." ...|$|E
