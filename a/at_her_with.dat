5|$|During the {{bombardment}} a small naval engagement occurred when, at 09:05, the obsolete Glasgow fired upon the St George using her armament of 7 nine-pounder guns and a Gatling gun, {{which had been}} a present from Queen Victoria to the sultan. The return fire caused Glasgow to sink, though the shallow harbour meant that her masts remained out of the water. Glasgows crew hoisted a British flag as a token of their surrender, {{and they were all}} rescued by British sailors in launches. Thrush also sank two steam launches whose Zanzibari crews shot <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> rifles. Some land fighting occurred when Khalid's men fired on Raikes' askaris, with little effect, as they approached the palace. The fighting ceased {{with the end of the}} shelling. The British controlled the town and the palace, and by the afternoon Hamud bin Muhammed, an Arab favourable to the British, had been installed as sultan with much reduced powers. The British ships and crews had fired around 500 shells, 4,100 machine gun rounds and 1,000 rifle rounds during the engagement.|$|E
5|$|The ballad, The Mermaid of Padstow, tells {{a similar}} story of a local named Tom Yeo, who shot the mermaid mistaking her for a seal. John Betjeman, who was well-acquainted with the area, wrote in 1969 that the mermaid met a local man {{and fell in love}} with him. When she could no longer bear living without him, she tried to lure him beneath the waves but he escaped by {{shooting}} her. In her rage she threw a handful of sand towards Padstow, around which the sandbank grew. In other versions of the tale, the mermaid sings from the rocks and a youth shoots <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> a crossbow, or a greedy man shoots her with a longbow. Mermaids were believed to sing to their victims so that they can lure adulterers to their death.|$|E
25|$|As the {{questioning}} continues, Ingrid admits to Emma {{that she wants}} her {{to be part of}} her family, but then uses mind tactics on Emma to convince her that her family do not love her, they fear her. Emma denies this, but as she pauses for a second, Ingrid casts a spell on a glass of water, and when she returns Ingrid increases the pressure on Emma, resulting in the glass of water to boil as Emma's powers are unleashed due to her fear, causing the wall in the station to blast open and Ingrid to escape. Emma then walks out and as David, Mary Margaret, Hook, Elsa, Gold, and Belle show up to stop her, Emma wants everyone to stay away but when Hook touches her, Emma causes the streetlight to fall on David. Emma runs away after a horrified Mary Margret looks <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> disgust and gets into her car driving away even as Mary Margret calls after her that it's okay. Everyone present suspects that The Snow Queen/Ingrid has succeeded in turning Emma against them. After Elsa and Hook are unable to find Emma, Mary Margret blames herself, stating that no one wants their family to see them as a monster. Elsa reassures a fearful Hook that Emma will be fine, but that she needs time alone {{to come to terms with}} her powers, the way she did. Meanwhile, a terrified Emma sits in her parked bug in the woods overlooking the town.|$|E

500|$|Aleppine {{historian}} Muhammad Raghib al-Tabbakh {{wrote that}} she was unique in Aleppo, and that [...] "people looked <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> a different eye". Although she had many suitors, she initially wished to remain single. However, she was persuaded to marry after her mother's death, and chose for husband Habib Ghadban, a scion of a local Christian family. They had one son and two daughters.|$|E
500|$|Set in the 1950s, Michael and his unnamed date (Ola Ray) {{run out of}} gas near a dark wooded area. They {{walk off}} into the forest, and Michael asks her if she would be [...] "his girl"; she accepts and he gives her a ring. He warns her, however, that he is [...] "different". A full moon appears, and Michael begins convulsing in agony, {{transforming}} into a werewolf. His date runs away in terror, but the werecat catches up to her, knocking her down and begins lunging <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> his claws. He also knocks down a tree. The scene then cuts to a modern-day movie theater where Michael and his date, along with a repulsed audience, are actually watching the scene unfold in a movie called Thriller.|$|E
500|$|There {{are other}} {{dimensions}} to the lyrics, with Gaga playing off her image of self-promotion and criticisms directed <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> the line [...] "I {{try to sell}} myself, but I am really laughing because I just want the music not the bling". In a review for Artpop, Simon Chandler from Tiny Mix Tapes gave {{a detailed analysis of}} the lyrical composition. According to him, Gaga wanted to portray her music as boundless in its meaning with [...] "Artpop", but it appeared to be arrogant since most of the conclusions derived about her music is from her public persona created and its media coverage. Chandler believed that the lyrics wanted to drive home a point about Gaga being the center for any discussion. With the previous lyrics, the implication is that Gaga's impassive personality utilizes her music to sell her brand name to the general crowd, and primarily fuels the public interest in her.|$|E

500|$|... "Bart Gets Famous" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder. The episode mocks the use of catchphrase-based humor. Many {{characters}} from The Simpsons have catchphrases, including Homer ("D'oh!"), Bart ("Eat My Shorts", [...] "¡Ay, caramba!" [...] and [...] "Don't have a cow, man!"), Marge (her worried [...] "hmmmm") and Maggie (her pacifier suck). The writers chose the phrase [...] "I didn't do it" [...] because they wanted a [...] "lousy" [...] phrase [...] "to point out how really crummy things can become really popular". It was also an intentional call {{back to the first}} season episode [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] where it was a catchphrase of Krusty the Clown. The episode ends with a self-referential scene in which several characters say their catchphrases, including the Simpsons, Ned Flanders, Nelson Muntz, Mr. Burns and Barney Gumble. All of the characters gather around Lisa and stare <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> an anticipating look, and Lisa, displeased, finishes the episode by muttering [...] "If anyone wants me I'll be in my room", to which Homer says [...] "what kind of a catchphrase is that?" ...|$|E
500|$|A woman (Lenora Crichlow) {{wakes up}} in a house and realizes she has amnesia. She is {{surrounded}} by images of a small girl (Imani Jackman)—whom she assumes is her daughter—as well as photos of herself and a man (Nick Ofield) and also by a television signal. She leaves the house and notices several people recording her on their phones who ignore her pleas for help. A masked man arrives and opens fire <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> a shotgun. She flees and meets Jem (Tuppence Middleton) and Damien (Ian Bonar). Jem and the woman escape the masked man, who kills Damien. Jem explains that a mysterious signal began appearing on television and over the Internet, {{while most of the}} population turned into passive voyeurs who do nothing but record everything around them. The woman and Jem are unaffected, but they are also a target for the [...] "hunters", unaffected humans who act sadistically. Jem plans to reach a transmitter at [...] "White Bear" [...] to destroy it and stop the signal's effect on the area.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{the myth}} of Inanna's descent to the underworld, {{represented}} in parallel Sumerian and Akkadian tablets, Inanna (Ishtar in the Akkadian texts) set off for the netherworld, or Kur, which was ruled by her sister Ereshkigal. Ereshkigal is in mourning at {{the death of her}} consort, Gugalanna (The Wild Bull of Heaven Sumerian Gu = Bull, Gal = Great, An = Heaven). [...] She passed through seven gates and at each one was required to leave a garment or an ornament so that when she had passed through the seventh gate she was a simple woman, entirely naked. Despite warnings about her presumption, she did not turn back but dared to sit herself down on Ereshkigal's throne. Immediately the Anunnaki of the underworld judged her, gazed <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> the eyes of death, and she became a corpse, hung up on a meathook.|$|E

2500|$|In the season's final episode, Roseanne {{reveals the}} entire series itself is {{actually}} a story written by Roseanne Conner about her life. To cope, Roseanne twisted major elements of her life for the story, which the audience does not discover until the final moments of the series. In reality, Dan's heart attack {{near the end of}} Season 8 was fatal and the Conner family did not win the lottery. [...] A story arc which runs through the final season, was that Dan betrayed Roseanne by having an affair. [...] We learn that Dan's betrayal wasn't by having an affair, but by dying. [...] Tough Roseanne, who could always take the worst life could throw <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> a laugh, could not handle Dan's death. [...] Also, Jackie is a lesbian and Beverly is straight. Scott is a probate lawyer that Roseanne befriended, and set up with Leon—who she claims isn't very hip like she wrote him to be. Another difference is that Mark and Darlene were a couple all along, as were David and Becky, rather than the opposite (Becky with Mark and Darlene with David).|$|E
2500|$|While fire raged aboard Blücher, the {{secondary}} Norwegian coastal batteries fired <b>at</b> <b>her</b> <b>with</b> guns ranging in calibre {{from the two}} small [...] pieces at Husvik, intended to protect the fortress' missing mine barrier, to the three [...] guns of the Kopås Battery {{on the eastern side}} of the fjord. The larger guns wrought havoc on board Blücher, while the 57mm guns concentrated on the cruiser's superstructure and the anti-aircraft weapons, and were partially successful in suppressing the fire from her light artillery as Blücher slowly sailed past the fortress. The Husvik battery had to be abandoned when Blücher passed in front of it and fired her light AA guns directly down into the positions. Although the main building at the battery caught fire, the Norwegians suffered no casualties. In all, thirteen 15cm rounds and around thirty 57mm shells hit the German cruiser as it passed the guns of the fortress' secondary batteries. One of the 15cm rounds from Kopås disabled Blüchers steering gear and forced the cruiser's crew to steer her using the engines and propeller to avoid running aground. Blüchers fire-fighting system was also knocked out by shell fragments from the two Norwegian batteries, making attempts to control the fires aboard the ship and rescue the many wounded much more difficult.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2009 U.S. Open {{semifinal}} round against Kim Clijsters, Williams slammed her racquet on {{the court}} after losing the first set. She was given a warning, with a potential second violation carrying a one-point penalty. While trailing 4–6, 5–6, 15–30, Williams's second serve was called a foot fault, resulting in two match points for Clijsters. Williams gestured with her racquet to the lineswoman {{who had made the}} call and yelled <b>at</b> <b>her,</b> <b>with</b> profanities and a threat to shove a tennis ball down the lineswoman's throat. During the subsequent on-court conference between the chair umpire, the lineswoman, US Open officials, and Williams, a television microphone picked up Williams saying to the lineswoman, [...] "I didn't say I would kill you! Are you serious?" [...] The incident resulted in Williams being penalized a point for unsportsmanlike conductnecessitated by the earlier warning for racquet abusemeaning Clijsters won the match 64, 75. The following day, Williams was issued the maximum permissible on-site fine of $10,000 (plus $500 for racquet abuse). After further investigation, the Grand Slam Committee in November 2009 fined her $175,000 in lieu of suspending her from the 2010 US Open or other Grand Slam events. They also placed her on a two-year probation, so if Williams committed another offense in the following two years at a Grand Slam tournament, she would be suspended from participating in the following US Open. If she committed no offenses in the next two years, her fine would be reduced to $82,500. Williams initially refused to apologize for her outburst, both in her post-match press conference and in an official statement released the following day. She eventually apologized stating [...] "I just really wanted to apologize sincerely, because I'm a very prideful person and I'm a very intense person and a very emotional person", and [...] "I wanted to offer my sincere apologies to anyone that I may have offended." [...] She said she had been humbled by the experience.|$|E
