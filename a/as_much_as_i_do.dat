5|$|In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview, Fischer {{explained}} {{his reasons for}} advocating Fischerandom Chess:In chess so much depends on opening theory, so the champions before the last century did not know <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> and other players do about opening theory. So if you just brought them {{back from the dead}} they wouldn't do well. They'd get bad openings. You cannot compare the playing strength, you can only talk about natural ability. Memorisation is enormously powerful. Some kid of fourteen today, or even younger, could get an opening advantage against Capablanca, and especially against the players of the previous century, like Morphy and Steinitz. Maybe they would still be able to outplay the young kid of today. Or maybe not, because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage, you know how to play, they have so many examples of what to do from this position... and that is why I don't like chess any more... It is all just memorization and prearrangement...|$|E
25|$|This is a {{book that}} clatters around in a dark closet of irrelevancies for 450 pages before it bumps accidentally into its index and stops; {{but that is not}} a criticism, either, because its author finds it gratifying and {{refreshing}} to bang unrelated facts together as a rebuke to stuffy minds. This book infuriated me; but that is not a defect in it, because it is supposed to infuriate people like me, and the author would have been happier still if I had blown out an artery. In short, this book is flawless, because all its deficiencies are deliberate products of art. Given its assumptions, there is nothing here to criticize. The only course open to a reviewer who dislikes this book <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> is to question its author’s fundamental assumptions—which are big-ticket items involving the nature and relationships of language, knowledge, and science.|$|E

Bon Jovi frontman Jon Bon Jovi, also a veteran, has said: [...] "We continue to make Number One records and fill stadiums. But will we still be doing 150 shows per tour? I just can't see it. I don't know how the hell Mick Jagger does it at 67. That {{would be the first}} question I'd ask him. He runs around the stage <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> yet he's got almost 20 years on me." [...] Since his early career Jagger has embodied what some authors describe as a [...] "Dionysian archetype" [...] of [...] "eternal youth" [...] personified by many rock stars and the rock culture.|$|E

When asked about Playground Games' involvement, Dan Greenawalt, the head of Turn 10 Studios, said, [...] "I wouldn't trust this partner <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> if I didn't expect them to surprise me and surprise our players. I have respect {{for their ability to}} come up with great ideas. So I think yes, they are challenged by the customers the same way we are to surprise them with innovation. That's how they see themselves, that's how we see them, it's how they see us. It's really a shared goal." ...|$|E

I hope that everyone who comes to the show enjoys it <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> Michelle is a prime example of an all-round entertainer, she has enjoyed many successes as a music artist and now theater goers are going to experience her far reaching talents once again" [...] whilst Williams is quoted as saying, [...] "It's a real thrill to be given the opportunity to play Roxie Hart in the West End's spectacular production of 'Chicago'."
