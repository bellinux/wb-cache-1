40|$|The {{effects of}} seed treatments, {{including}} cooking, popping germination and flour <b>air</b> <b>classification,</b> on the functional properties and antinutritional factors of Amaranthus caudatus and Amaranthus cruentus seeds were studied. Thermal treatments increased the water absorption {{with a maximum}} value of 5. 1 and 6. 3 g g- 1 in flour of popped seeds of both species.

40|$|Milling and <b>air</b> <b>classification</b> is a {{well-known}} procedure to obtain protein and starch enriched fractions from cereals and grain legumes. Adhesion of small protein particles to larger starch granules adversely affects the separation efficiency during <b>air</b> <b>classification.</b> To gain insight into this phenomenon the dispersion of bimodal mixtures of starch granules and fine protein particles in an air stream was studied. Using a method to correct {{for the number of}} small starch particles in the protein fraction, the dispersability of protein/starch mixtures was determined. The type of protein and, particularly, of starch may affect dispersability. The effect of starch type is not only caused by differences in granule size; likely other properties such as roughness are also involved. Increasing protein content enhances dispersability but {{does not seem to have}} an effect on the adhesion between starch and protein particles itself. An increase in adhesion by relative humidity of 90 % results in a decreased dispersability. The dispersability of the mixtures was related to their performance upon <b>air</b> <b>classification.</b> Both the separation efficiency and tau were strongly related to dispersability (R 2 = 0. 86 and 0. 88 respectively).

The resistant starch content was increased in the high protein flour (HPF) fraction and germinated flour compared with the raw flour, while its content decreased in the heat treated seed flours. These processes also affected the starch gelatinization temperature and peak viscosity. The thermal properties of the starch flour were not affected by <b>air</b> <b>classification</b> while gelatinization energy was decreased significantly (by 52. 0 and 90. 0 % and by 70. 0 and 95. 0 %) in cooked and popped A caudatus and A cruentus seed flours, respectively.

40|$|The {{amount of}} biomass ash (BA) {{produced}} worldwide {{is expected to}} increase in the near future because biomass is commonly regarded as a carbon neutral fuel. Therefore, sustainable methods for the utilization of BA will be needed to manage the increased flux of BA from the energy sector while concurrently dealing with a smaller allowance of BA that can be landfilled. Therefore, research into new technologies is needed to find and exploit methods to utilize BA in safe and economically and environmentally sustainable ways in order to maximize the environmental benefits of biomass combustion. Presently BAs are utilized primarily in the construction of landfills or disposed of in landfills, with a minor percentage recycled for various purposes. Viable alternatives to landfill construction and landfill disposal require supportive evidence for their practicality, which is currently limited. One of the main barriers to reuse is the presence of heavy metals in BA. Therefore, finding effective methods for isolating and removing heavy metals is important to allowing reuse and is pursued in this work. Furthermore, this thesis seeks to assess the quality of specific BA samples as the quality pertains to their final usage, and to assess the sustainability of the usage solution to the comparable product that BA is replacing. Technologies were evaluated for their suitability and feasibility for utilizing BA as a replacement for traditional natural resources in specific applications. This thesis will seek to clarify the usage of <b>air</b> <b>classification</b> for refining BA for reuse as a product with the goal of contributing to the knowledge of viable and sustainable solutions for the reuse of BA.

40|$|Dry milling in {{combination}} with <b>air</b> <b>classification</b> was evaluated {{as an alternative to}} conventional wet extraction of protein from yellow field peas (Pisum sativum). Major advantages of dry fractionation are retention of native functionality of proteins and its lower energy and water use. Peas were ground by impact (ZPS 50) and jet milling (AFG 100) at various classifier wheel speeds to provide pea flours with different particle size distributions, protein contents and damaged starch levels. Peas were milled under various conditions to maximally disentangle starch granules from the surrounding protein bodies. The optimal milling conditions were confirmed by particle size analysis and scanning electron microscope imaging. Too extensive milling, e. g. using ultrafine impact or jet milling, resulted in very fine flours (with D 0. 5 < 10 µm) with poor flowability, whereas ultrafine jet milling led to an increased percentage of damaged starch. Subsequently, <b>air</b> <b>classification</b> was applied to separate small fragments (primarily protein bodies) from the coarse fraction (starch granules) to obtain enriched protein concentrates. Protein concentrates were obtained with protein contents between 51 % and 55 % (w/dw) and a maximum protein recovery of 77 %. Deviating cut-off size for <b>air</b> <b>classification</b> could be ascribed to build-up of material between the vanes of the classifier wheel. Finally, water holding capacity (WHC) tests were used to evaluate the functional properties of the pea protein concentrates. A liquid pea concentrate comprising 26 % (w/w) of protein could be prepared from dry pea concentrates containing more than 30 % (w/dw) of pea protein. This was explained by the high solubility of pea protein in its native state. After heat treatment of pea protein concentrates, a gel with a high WHC of 4. 8 g water (w/w) was obtained, which decreased with increasing protein content. Functional properties of the pea protein concentrates are interesting for preparation of high-protein foods or for replacement of egg protein functionalit...|$|E

In this study, the effects of particle size and unburned carbon content of fly ash on the compressive strength of geopolymers have been studied over a compositional range in geopolymer gels. Unburned carbon was effectively separated in the − 46 µm fraction using an air classifier and the fixed carbon content declined from 3. 04 wt % to 0. 06 wt%.

40|$|Aggregate {{is defined}} as {{particles}} of rock which in combination are used as a civil engineering material. It is used in bounded form in asphalt and concrete. Historically natural sand {{has been used as}} fine aggregate for concrete production in Sweden. Due to environmental reasons the Swedish government is limiting the extraction of natural sand resources. Manufactured sand is therefore being investigated in Sweden as a replacement product. Properties of the fine aggregates such as shape and particle size distribution are affecting the properties of both the uncured and finished concrete. It is possible to produce manufactured sand with a good shape, however the crushing process results in a relative large amount of fines (particles smaller than 63 µm). Research shows that the amount of fines in manufactured sand affects concrete properties such as, workability, water demand, drying shrinkage, compressive and flexural strength. To achieve a good concrete the manufactured sand should have somewhere between 5 - 10 mass percent of fines depending on rock type. It is common that manufactured sand has around 15 - 25 mass percent of fines after the crushing stage. In this thesis, dry <b>air</b> <b>classification</b> has been investigated {{to reduce the amount of}} fines in manufactured sand. There exists a number of air classifiers produced for different industrial use. This work has investigated two air classifiers using different design approaches. The investigated air classifiers were a circulating air classifier and a two-stage air classifier. The circulating air classifier investigated is based around a centrifugal-crossflow separation zone and an internal aerodynamic cycle. The classification process is controlled by two fans, the circulating fan and the separator fan. The circulating fan creates the internal circulating air flow. The air flow created by the separator fan changes the cut size. Experiments performed on the circulating air classifier showed a diffuse cut size. It was possible to reduce the amount of fines from 15 mass percent to 5 mass percent. The two-stage classifier is based on two different air classifiers serial mounted using the same external air fan. The first stage consists of a gravitational-crossflow separation zone modified by allowing for recirculating of particles towards the separation zone. The second stage is based around a vertical standing centrifugal-counterflow zone modified to allow for recirculation of material. The two-stage classifier produces three different products, and both performed experiments and models have shown that recirculation is important to get a sharp cut size. The amount of fines was at best reduced in the coarse product from 15 mass percent to 1 mass percent. In conclusion, <b>air</b> <b>classification</b> has been technically proven to be able to reduce the amount of fines in the finished product. The classification result will depend on the chosen technology. The economic feasibility of <b>air</b> <b>classification</b> for manufactured sand production will depend upon the local supply of natural sand and the quarry situation.

However, little research has directly addressed the role of snow cover extent in the production and/or maintenance of diverse air mass types. The major hypothesis {{of this study is that}} continental-scale snow cover anomalies should influence air mass frequencies because of their important effects on land-surface energy budgets. To test this hypothesis, satellite-derived Northern Hemisphere snow cover data were used in conjunction with a unique <b>air</b> mass <b>classification</b> routine to ascertain the association between air mass frequencies and snow cover anomalies across eastern North America. Results indicate that continental-scale snow cover anomalies are strongly associated with changes in the frequency of air masses over eastern North America. However, strong mid-tropospheric circulation anomalies are often associated with the snow cover and air mass frequency changes, making it difficult to judge the relative importance of the sno...|$|R
