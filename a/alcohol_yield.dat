40|$|The {{catalytic}} conversion of glycerol was performed with iron oxide-based catalysts for production of allyl alcohol using a fixed-bed flow reactor at 623 K under atmospheric pressure. The glycerol dehydration proceeds on acid sites of catalysts while the allyl alcohol production {{is assumed to}} be catalyzed by non-acidic sites of catalysts through a hydrogen transfer mechanism. Different alkali metals, including Na, K, Rb, and Cs were supported on ZrO 2 -FeOx and all of them gave impressively higher allyl <b>alcohol</b> <b>yield</b> and suppressed glycerol dehydration due to the reduced catalyst acidic property. K-supported ZrO 2 -FeOx (K/ZrO 2 -FeOx) was chosen for further studies, and allyl <b>alcohol</b> <b>yield</b> remarkably increased up to 27 mol% C at the K content of 3 - 5 mol%. Since no external hydrogen gas is supplied to the system, the hydrogen transfer mechanism should take place between the reaction of glycerol and either hydrogen atoms derived from formic acid forming during the reaction, or active hydrogen species produced from the decomposition of H 2 O by ZrO 2. Addition of Al 2 O 3 to K/ZrO 2 -FeOx (K/Al 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 -FeOx) was examined in order to improve structure stability during the glycerol conversion. Al 2 O 3 addition to the catalyst was effective to achieve higher structure stability, leading to high glycerol conversion with stable allyl <b>alcohol</b> <b>yield</b> of above 25 mol% C.

40|$|Background Lignocellulosic biomass is {{a viable}} source of {{renewable}} energy for bioethanol production. For the efficient conversion of biomass into bioethanol, {{it is essential that}} sugars from both the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions of lignocellulose be utilised. Results We describe the development of a recombinant yeast system for the fermentation of cellulose and xylose, the most abundant pentose sugar in the hemicellulose fraction of biomass. The brewer?s yeast Saccharomyces pastorianus was chosen as a host as significantly higher recombinant enzyme activities are achieved, when compared to the more commonly used S. cerevisiae. When expressed in S. pastorianus, the Trichoderma reesei xylose oxidoreductase pathway was more efficient at alcohol production from xylose than the xylose isomerase pathway. The <b>alcohol</b> <b>yield</b> was influenced by the concentration of xylose in the medium and was significantly improved by the additional expression of a gene encoding for xylulose kinase. The xylose reductase, xylitol dehydrogenase and xylulose kinase genes were co-expressed with genes encoding for the three classes of T. reesei cellulases, namely endoglucanase (EG 2), cellobiohydrolysase (CBH 2) and ?-glucosidase (BGL 1). The initial metabolism of xylose by the engineered strains facilitated production of cellulases at fermentation temperatures. The sequential metabolism of xylose and cellulose generated an <b>alcohol</b> <b>yield</b> of 82 % from the available sugars. Several different types of biomass, such as the energy crop Miscanthus sinensis and the industrial waste, brewer?s spent grains, were examined as biomass sources for fermentation using the developed yeast strains. Xylose metabolism and cell growth were inhibited in fermentations carried out with acid-treated spent grain liquor, resulting in a 30 % reduction in <b>alcohol</b> <b>yield</b> compared to fermentations carried out with mixed sugar substrates. Conclusions Reconstitution of complete enzymatic pathways for cellulose hydrolysis and xylose utilisation in S. pastorianus facilitates the co-fermentation of cellulose and xylose without the need for added exogenous cellulases and provides a basis {{for the development of a}} consolidated process for co-utilisation of hemicellulose and cellulose sugars...|$|E
