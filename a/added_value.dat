40|$|In {{order to}} {{classify}} stormwater as a resource, {{rather than a}} problem, tools to emphasize <b>added</b> <b>values</b> generated by the stormwater system, are needed. In this study, {{the aim was to}} develop a method based on <b>added</b> <b>values</b> and risks for comparison and evaluation of stormwater systems. How <b>added</b> <b>values</b> are classified differs from case to case. The approach and the purpose of the analysis also affects the evaluation of <b>added</b> <b>values.</b> In this report <b>added</b> <b>values</b> are defined as:A value, for an individual, an organisation or the environment, other than the object's main intended purpose. In this report five different categories of risks and <b>added</b> <b>values</b> were studied, namely: environment, economy, technology, health and socioculture. In the analysis of <b>added</b> <b>values</b> the data collection was made in a questionnaire. A group was appointed the task to compile the answers and evaluate the outcome and identify the <b>added</b> <b>values</b> generated by the stormwater system. The risk assessment was conducted by estimating probabilities and consequences of a range of identified risk sources. The results were presented in a matrix. The methodology was tested in a case study where two stormwater systems were evaluated and compared to each other. One of the systems was a swale system and the other was a piped storm drainage system. The result showed no major differences with respect to <b>added</b> <b>values,</b> on the contrary, the risk assessment indicated some significant differences. The case study confirms that the developed and evaluated tool is applicable for this type of evaluation and comparison between different stormwater systems in diverse surroundings. The method, developed in this study can with advantage be used as a complementing tool when evaluating different stormwater system options. Validerat; 20150609 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R

25|$|As {{would be}} expected, these fifes were notably more {{internally}} in tune than most previous fifes, since {{the designs of}} the 1830s fell from favor, and had the <b>added</b> <b>value</b> of being tunable with each other (by sliding the joint or the head cork). In addition, they gave the player greater dynamic control and could be played even louder than traditional fifes, {{the result of the}} lower cone in the bore. At first, only six hole (Model J) fifes were made, but by 1960, McDonagh designed and Seaman manufactured a 10-hole (Model L). Two of the holes were used by RH2 – covering only one of the two produced F natural. Some players found this quite difficult, so eventually (c. 1970s), an 11-hole model was introduced, the Model M, with both the original double RH2 holes and an RH thumb hole to choose from for the F natural. These were actually ideas derived from several makers of the days of the 19th century, including Giorgi, even though {{there was no need for}} F natural in traditional fife music.|$|E
