50|$|Improper set-up {{of these}} wheels meant either {{a lack of}} tone, or—usually {{in the case of}} over-eager amateur or {{impatient}} guitarists—too harsh a tone caused by wheels being forced too tightly against the strings. This improper set-up resulted in a quick wearing down of the wheels for which there were no replacements—the wheels were not removable from the <b>arm</b> <b>attachments.</b> This was true of both guitar and bass units.|$|R
50|$|Drill Arm: An <b>arm</b> <b>attachment</b> that {{consists}} of a rocket-boosted oversized drill. Unfortunately, such a weapon is in reality quite impractical as it is basically a massive gyroscope, and is incredibly difficult to wield due to the torque it produces. However, the pilots eventually develop the skill to make limited use of this weapon, and it is later seen in several scenarios where other weapons are unavailable.|$|E

5000|$|Today, {{intact and}} working legacy Gizmotrons are {{virtually}} non-existent. The Gizmo wheels and <b>arm</b> <b>attachments</b> {{were made of}} a plastic (Delrin) that cracks and weakens over time. As a result, the wheels and arms of all Gizmotrons become brittle, fall apart, and disintegrate into smaller pieces all by themselves even in [...] "like new" [...] unopened boxes. Other guitar effects have since been used to create sustained tones, {{but because of the}} different mechanical nature and physics involved, none of them replicate the sound of the Gizmotron.|$|R

5000|$|Sometimes, robots {{that were}} not {{originally}} Swiss army bots have had their weapons changed or altered on the fly, typically due to malfunctions. A notable example of this was Ghost Raptor in BattleBots 2015: after its spinning bar weapon broke in its first fight, its builder Chuck Pitzer improvized new weapons for each following fight, including a [...] "De-Icer" [...] <b>arm</b> <b>attachment</b> which it used to unbalance and defeat the highly-fancied bar spinner Icewave in the quarter-finals, a result that was considered a shock upset.|$|E
50|$|Knot Buster: An <b>arm</b> <b>attachment</b> {{specifically}} designed by Rika Domeki to strike and destroy a Heterodyne's Fractal Knot, the weak {{point of the}} creatures. It is a claw with an integral explosive-propelled pile driver, far more practical and controllable than the Drill Arm. One simply targets the Heterodyne's Fractal Knot, latches onto it with the claw and triggers the pile driver, impaling it. This weapon was only used once by Dai-Guard before being claimed by the Army for use by its own robot, Kokubogar, but was destroyed soon afterward.|$|E

While the 59 used Triumph Herald front uprights, the 59B used the Formula Two version Lotus 41X uprights and brakes shared with Lotus 47A. Hubs and wheels were knock-off type with spin-on central lock nut, except for the Formula Ford version, which had the Ford production 4 lugnut configuration as per the formula.|$|E

2500|$|A new {{race car}} called the Viper Competition Coupe took the GTS-R's {{place for the}} second phase. The Viper Competition Coupe had the same 8.3-liter V10 engine as the street Viper, but {{increased}} power to , and [...] of torque. The Competition Coupe had a carbon fiber composite body on a tubular steel frame with no interior trim and an FIA-legal roll cage. [...] The exterior design of the Competition Coupe {{was based on the}} Viper GTS-R concept from 1999. [...] Modifications to the mechanicals of the Viper were a 27-gallon fuel cell, differential cooler, ducted brakes, improved driver and engine cooling, trap door oil pan, low-inertia flywheel, an improved double-wishbone suspension system, new spherical bearing control <b>arm</b> <b>attachments,</b> two-way adjustable coil over dampers, and a driver-adjustable blade-type rear anti-roll bar. [...] The anti-lock braking system added a distribution control system. The initial price of the car is around $100,000.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} shown (Hines, M., and J. J. Blum, Biophys. J., 1984, 46 : 559 - 565) that passive moment-bearing links do not {{contribute}} appreciable twist resistance to an axoneme nor do they cause appreciable twisting in response to internal shear forces. We now examine the contribution of active moment-bearing links such as dynein arms to the generation of twist within an axoneme. The dynein model used causes distal sliding of the adjacent doublet by a force dependent on the angle of <b>attachment</b> of the <b>arms.</b> <b>Attachment</b> of the <b>arms</b> occurs at a specified angle relative to the angle of minimum potential energy. The steady state shape consistent with the forces applied by the attached dyneins is computed. It is shown that the twist generated in an active region is counterclockwise as viewed from tip to base and therefore accumulates {{at the end of}} the axoneme. For realistic forces and twist resistances, cumulative twist should not exceed a few degrees...|$|R
50|$|Knot Punisher: Like the Knot Buster, it is {{designed}} to strike the Fractal Knot of the Heterodyne. Unknown to the Army, Domeki designed the Knot Buster merely as a prototype for this weapon. Where the Knot Buster is a single <b>arm</b> <b>attachment,</b> the Knot Punisher utilizes both arms. One arm utilizes the same pile driver-claw utility of the Knot Buster, but instead of an explosive charge, it is driven by a torque-less counter-rotating dual flywheel attached to the other arm. The flywheel is spun up in advance, the Heterodyne's Fractal Knot is grasped with the claw, and the flywheel is inserted into the pile driver's gear port, firing the spike and impaling the knot. The flywheel itself {{can be used as a}} melee weapon, as it is quite sturdy and possesses a greater radius than the arm and more stability than the drill arm. The downsides with this system is that Dai-Guard cannot pick anything up with it in place, (aside from using the claw), and it takes a considerable amount of time to install the equipment prior to battle.|$|E
50|$|The {{long and}} short heads of the biceps femoris each branch off into 5 {{attachment}} arms as they course distally in the knee. In the posterolateral corner, the long head has 3 important anatomic attachments. The direct <b>arm</b> <b>attachment</b> is on the posterolateral fibular styloid, the anterior arm lateral to the FCL and the lateral aponeurotic arm on the posterior and lateral portion of the FCL. The short head of the biceps also has 3 important arms in the posterolateral corner. The capsular arm attaches to the posterolateral capsule {{as well as the}} fibula, just lateral to the styloid and provides a strong attachment to the capsule, lateral gastrocnemius tendon, and capsuloosseus layer of the IT band. The fabellofibular ligament is actually a thickening of the capsular arm of the biceps femoris as it runs distally to the fibula. The direct arm attaches to the posterior and lateral aspect of the fibular styloid. The anterior arm attaches to the tibia at the same site as the mid-third lateral capsular ligament and is often injured in Segond fractures. Injuries to the biceps femoris tendons have been reported in patients with anterolateral-anteromedial rotatory instability.|$|E

However, only the wife of the baker turned him down and Kanedama attempt to force the woman to reconsider by putting up the ante as the Kakurangers help her out. However, due to getting a bump {{on the back of his}} head while fighting the Kakurangers, Kanedama's con is exposed as he laced the entire building with his coins before going after Hiroshi with Sasuke saving the baker's son. Though he uses his Thievery Jutsu to take the Kakurangers' Kakulasers from them, he is defeated by Ninja Red using his Full-Moon Cut on the Yokai. Kanedama is quickly enlarged, with the Beast General Fighters delivering a quick beating to Kanedama before destroying him with Fighter Crush. Once he was destroyed, Kanedama's coins faded and his spell was broken.|$|E

25|$|Sadamasa Arikawa (who {{worked with}} Eiji Tsuburaya) {{said that the}} sculptors {{had a hard time}} coming up with a King Kong suit that appeased Tsuburaya. The first suit was {{rejected}} for being too fat with long legs giving Kong an almost cute look. A few other designs were done before Tsuburaya would approve the final look that was ultimately used in the film. The suit was given two separate masks and two separate pairs of arms. Long arm extensions which contained poles inside the arms for Hirose to grab onto and with static immovable hands was used for long shots of Kong, while short human length arms were added to the suit for scenes that required Kong to grab items and wrestle with Godzilla. Besides the suit with the two separate <b>arm</b> <b>attachments,</b> a meter high model and a puppet of Kong (used for closeups) were also built. As well, a huge prop of Kong's hand was built for the scene where he grabs Mie Hama (Fumiko) and carries her off.|$|R

50|$|Within {{the distal}} {{borders of the}} incision, the semitendinosus and {{gracilis}} tendons are found beneath the sartorius muscle fascia. The distal tibial attachment of the sMCL can be found under these identified tendons, making up {{the floor of the}} pes anserine bursa, 6 cm distal to the joint line. Once identified, the remaining soft tissue is removed from the attachment site. An eyelet pin is then drilled through attachment site transversely through the tibia, making sure the starting point is located at the posterior aspect of the site to ensure better biomechanical outcomes. Over the eyelet pin, a 7-mm reamer (6 mm considered in smaller patients) is reamed to a depth of 25 mm. Once prepared, attention is directed to preparing the reconstruction tunnel for the tibial attachment of the POL. Above the anterior <b>arm</b> <b>attachment</b> of the semimembranosus muscle tendon, the tibial attachment of the central arm of the POL is identified. This attachment is exposed by making a small incision parallel to the fibers along the posterior edge of the anterior arm of the semimembranosus tendon. Once exposed, an eyelet pin is drilled through the tibia toward Gerdy’s tubercle (anterolateral tibia). After verifying the correct anatomic eyelet pin placement, a 7-mm reamer is used over the pin to drill a tunnel depth of 25 mm.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} our project was to provide Charlie with a device that he could talk with others.

40|$|Purposes:To {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} using the single-joint Hybrid Assistive Limb® robot (HAL) to assist with shoulder flexion-extension in healthy adults, and to assess {{the capacity of the}} HAL to analyze the bioelectrical signals of muscle activity for shoulder flexion-extension. Methods:This cross-sectional feasibility study included six healthy adult men with no impairment in shoulder motion. The single-joint HAL was fixed to a custom-designed platform and upper <b>arm</b> <b>attachment,</b> and aligned 3 cm below the acromion process. Vital signs, shoulder fatigue, and shoulder pain were evaluated before and after the shoulder elevation exercise performed with and without the HAL. Activity of selected muscles of the shoulder was recorded using a wireless superficial electromyography device. Shoulder movement was captured using a three-dimensional motion analysis system. Results:The HAL supported smooth flexion-extension of the arm at the shoulder joint, with no negative effects on vital signs, shoulder fatigue, and shoulder pain. The HAL decreased muscle activity levels, with a 55 % decrease in trapezius muscle activity. The upward rotation angle of the scapula was significantly lower with the HAL at 120 ° of shoulder flexion. Conclusion:The single-joint HAL provided safe and effective assistance to scapular plane shoulder flexion-extension among healthy adults...|$|E

Servos can be calibrated from a special control screen on the CBC w/o any programming to test/adjust their mechanical positions for a desired angular command.|$|R
50|$|An added {{complication}} is {{the phenomenon}} of backscatter, where the flash reflects off particles or plankton in the water. Even seemingly clear water contains enormous amounts of this particulate, {{even if it is}} not readily seen by the naked eye. The best technique for avoiding backscatter is positioning the strobe away from the axis of the camera lens. Ideally, this means the flash will not light up the water {{directly in front of the}} lens, but will still strike the subject.

50|$|This most basal Carboniferous {{tetrapod}} had a large, somewhat triangular head, {{similar to}} that of later American sister-genus Whatcheeria, from which it is distinguished by various skeletal features, such as a spike-like latissimus dorsi (an <b>arm</b> muscle) <b>attachment</b> on the humerus and several minor skull features. The feet had characteristics that distinguished it from the paddle-like feet of the Devonian Ichthyostegalia and resembled the feet of later, more terrestrially adapted Carboniferous forms. Pederpes is the earliest-known tetrapod to show the beginnings of terrestrial locomotion and despite the probable presence of a sixth digit on the forelimbs it was at least functionally pentadactyl.|$|R
40|$|Zampanolide is a microtubule-stabilising marine natural product, with {{promise as}} a cancer drug candidate. The {{potential}} therapeutic application of zampanolide has fuelled worldwide interest in its total synthesis, but few analogue {{studies have been}} reported. Analogues afford the possibility of examining the structure-activity relationships {{with a view to}} optimising for potency and medicinal viability. This project seeks to devise a new route to zampanolide and generate a series of analogues for bioactivity evaluation. The initial approach to zampanolide and a number of designed analogues was through disconnections at C 20 by an N-aldol reaction, at C 1 by Yamaguchi esterification, at C 8 -C 9 by metathesis and at C 15 -C 16 by alkynylation. During the development of fragment syntheses, problems were encountered with protection of the secondary hydroxyl group at C 19 and establishment of an aldehyde at C 15. Useful natural and analogue fragments were generated during this exploratory phase. The order of connections was revised, and effort has been put towards the improvement of the synthetic efficiency. A three-component reaction involving (triphenylphosphoranylidene) -ketene, also known as Bestmann ylide, as a linchpin was envisaged to provide the dienoate of zampanolide. This is an expanded application of Bestmann ylide and therefore the scope of this linchpin reaction was investigated using simple alcohols and aldehydes. Success in the scoping study fortified this approach, and the coupling of the C 3 -C 8 and C 16 -C 20 fragments of zampanolide proceeded with good yields and stereoselectivity of the E,Z-geometry. The planned late stage connections were tested on model substrates. The side <b>arm</b> <b>attachment</b> by a chiral boron reagent-promoted aza-aldol reaction failed to produce desired product on a simple model. However, model substrates that better account for the functionality of the zampanolide macrocycle are proposed for subsequent studies. In case these also do not succeed, reliable alternative methods described in the literature would be used. Several methods were scanned for the asymmetric alkynylation required for the C 15 -C 16 bond connection. That involving ProPhenol and diethylzinc produced an excellent yield with a model alkyne. Although the stereoselectivity of the alkynylation is yet to be optimized, it was also tested on the full zampanolide fragment generated from the Bestmann ylide reaction. A small amount of the desired product was isolated, establishing 16 out of the 18 carbons of the macrocycle. Formation of a macrocycle is close at hand...|$|E

40|$|The {{internal}} {{mechanism of}} cilia {{is among the}} most ancient biological motors on an evolutionary scale. It produces beat patterns that consist of two phases: during the effective stroke, the cilium moves approximately as a straight rod, and during the recovery stroke, it rolls close to the surface in a tangential motion. It is commonly agreed that these two phases are designed for efficient functioning: the effective stroke encounters strong viscous resistance and generates thrust, whereas the recovery stroke returns the cilium to starting position while avoiding viscous resistance. Metachronal coordination between cilia, which occurs when many of them beat close to each other, is believed to be an autonomous result of the hydrodynamical interactions in the system. Qualitatively, metachronism is perceived as a way for reducing the energy expenditure required for beating. This paper presents a quantitative study of the energy expenditure of beating cilia, and of the energetic significance of metachronism. We develop a method for computing the work done by model cilia that beat in a viscous fluid. We demonstrate that for a single cilium, beating in water, the mechanical work done during the effective stroke is approximately five times the amount of work done during the recovery stroke. Investigation of multicilia configurations shows that having neighboring cilia beat metachronally is energetically advantageous and perhaps even crucial for multiciliary functioning. Finally, the model is used to approximate the number of dynein <b>arm</b> <b>attachments</b> that are likely to occur during the effective and recovery strokes of a beat cycle, predicting that almost all of the available dynein arms should participate in generating the motion...|$|R
50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the radius <b>arm</b> forward <b>attachments</b> not being on the axis of the lower link arm inner pivots, it would appear at first glance that free movement of the suspension would be impossible without some components bending, or the trailing arm elastomeric bushes being compressed unduly. However, as described above, the crossbeam is rubber mounted to the body. The crossbeam and lower links maintain the correct toe angle of one wheel relative to the other, however due to the relative angles of the trailing radius arms, body roll results in the entire cross-beam and lower links pivoting slightly about the crossbeam's mounting points, thus inducing a small amount of passive rear wheel steering, which may result in significantly improved handling. When the Jaguar components are re-used in other vehicles, the differential is often rigidly mounted to the chassis, different radius arm configurations are used, and the passive rear wheel steering effect is lost.|$|R
50|$|A {{brand new}} Godzilla suit was {{designed}} for this film and some slight alterations were done to its overall appearance. These alterations included the removal of its tiny ears, three toes on each foot rather than four, enlarged central dorsal fins and a bulkier body. These new features gave Godzilla a more reptilian/dinosaurian appearance. Outside of the suit, a meter high model and a small puppet were also built. Another puppet (from the waist up) was also designed that had a nozzle in the mouth to spray out liquid mist simulating Godzilla's atomic breath. However the shots in the film where this prop was employed (far away shots of Godzilla breathing its atomic breath during its attack on the Arctic Military base) were ultimately cut from the film. These cut scenes {{can be seen in}} the Japanese theatrical trailer. Finally, a separate prop of Godzilla's tail was also built for close up practical shots when its tail would be used (such as the scene where Godzilla trips Kong with its tail). The tail prop would be swung offscreen by a stage hand.Sadamasa Arikawa (who worked with Eiji Tsuburaya) said that the sculptors had a hard time coming up with a King Kong suit that appeased Tsuburaya.
