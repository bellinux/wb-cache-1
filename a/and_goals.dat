40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of rule changes on game-related statistics in men’s water polo matches. A total of 856 men’s matches played in all Olympic Games and World Championship since 1936 was analysed. The game-related statistics considered were: total goals, winners’ goals, losers’ goals, goals per minute, goals difference, relationship difference <b>goals</b> <b>and</b> total <b>goals,</b> <b>and</b> relationship difference <b>goals</b> <b>and</b> winners’ <b>goals.</b> The rule changes were grouped by structural (game and period) and functional changes (possession time, exclusion time, timing, minimum distance to take a direct shot). Differences between rule changes were determined using a one-way ANOVA. In general, the changes in water polo rules were shown to have an effect on the final result of the matches. There were differences in each rule change of duration (increased total <b>goals</b> <b>and</b> winners’ <b>goals),</b> period (increased total <b>goals</b> <b>and</b> winners’ <b>goals),</b> possession time (increased losers’ goals), timing (increased total, winners’, losers’, <b>and</b> decreased % <b>goals</b> <b>and</b> total <b>goals)</b> <b>and</b> fouls (increased total <b>goals</b> <b>and</b> losers’ <b>goals).</b> The analysis in game-related statistics through the rule changes could be used to evaluate their effects and/or justify future modifications...|$|R
40|$|To (1) {{examine whether}} {{reducing}} discrepancies between <b>goal</b> importance <b>and</b> <b>goal</b> attainability is an adaptive predictor of well-being, (2) investigate intrusion, awareness, optimism, and pessimism as determinants of reducing discrepancies between <b>goal</b> importance <b>and</b> <b>goal</b> attainability, <b>and</b> (3) explore how goal progress {{is involved in}} reducing discrepancies between <b>goal</b> importance <b>and</b> <b>goal</b> attainability during two major periods after a colorectal cancer diagnosis. Prospective design. Newly diagnosed colorectal cancer patients (n = 120) were interviewed three times: within a month, 7 months (treatment period), and 18 months (follow-up period) post-diagnosis. Data were analysed using multiple regressions. Results showed that (1) reducing discrepancies enhances well-being, (2) optimism and pessimism are predictors of reducing discrepancies during the treatment period but not during the follow-up period, while intrusion and awareness do not predict reducing discrepancies in either period, <b>and</b> (3) <b>goal</b> progress is a predictor of reducing discrepancies during the follow-up period, but no evidence for a moderating or mediating role of goal progress in the relation between psychological characteristics and reducing discrepancies was found. Reducing discrepancies between <b>goal</b> importance <b>and</b> <b>goal</b> attainability could benefit colorectal cancer patients' well-being. Optimism, pessimism, <b>and</b> <b>goal</b> progress appear to influence cancer patients' ability to reduce discrepancies. Providing assistance in improving goal progress {{to those who are}} less optimistic and highly pessimistic may be a suitable training for cancer patients to prevent deterioration in well-being. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? More discrepancy between <b>goal</b> importance <b>and</b> <b>goal</b> attainability is associated with lower levels of well-being. People are able to change evaluations of importance and attainability, but it is unknown whether this positively impacts well-being. Underlying causes of differences in the extent to which discrepancies between <b>goal</b> importance <b>and</b> <b>goal</b> attainability are reduced are unknown. What does this study add? This is the first study to show that reducing discrepancies between <b>goal</b> importance <b>and</b> <b>goal</b> attainability is beneficial for well-being. This is the first study to show that optimism and pessimism are determinants of reducing discrepancies between <b>goal</b> importance <b>and</b> <b>goal</b> attainability. Goal progress might be an effective target for interventions that aim to facilitate one's ability to reduce discrepancies between <b>goal</b> importance <b>and</b> <b>goal</b> attainabilit...|$|R

The results indicate that high school peer leaders perceived an increase in both their leadership <b>and</b> <b>goal</b> setting skills. Results from retrospective pretest measures of the leadership <b>and</b> <b>goal</b> setting scales also indicate that the participants had overestimated those skills prior to their peer-leadership experience.
