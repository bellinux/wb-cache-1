His analogy was with divorce law; <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>does</b> not need to have committed adultery for his wife to have grounds to divorce him, but rather she simply has to believe that he has committed adultery. This is because such a belief would destroy the trust and confidence within the relationship. This brought criticism from several government ministers including Sir John Hobson, the Attorney-General for England and Wales, saying that it would mean condemning a man on the basis of suspicion rather than evidence.|$|E

Reitman {{emerges as a}} modern-day Frank Capra, {{capturing}} the nation's anxieties and culture of resilience." [...] Stephen Saito of IFC.com wrote, [...] "It touches on larger themes of mass unemployment, cultural alienation and technology as a crutch. But ultimately, it's really an expertly done character study that's a dramatic change of pace from director Jason Reitman's previous two films." [...] Jonathan Romney of The Independent wrote, [...] "Its cynical wit almost places it in the Billy Wilder bracket: Up In The Air is as eloquent about today's executive culture as The Apartment was about that of 1960. It is a brutal, desolate film – but also a superb existential rom-com, and the most entertaining lesson in contemporary socio-economics that you could hope for." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film four stars and wrote, [...] "This isn't a comedy. If it were, {{it would be hard}} to laugh in these last days of 2009. Nor is it a tragedy. It's an observant look at how <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>does</b> a job." ...|$|E
500|$|Statements {{regarding}} Jesuit-encouraged plots against Queen Elizabeth {{were read}} to the court, {{as well as some}} of the plotters' confessions. Garnet defended his use of equivocation with his own treatise on the doctrine. He had denied his conversation with Oldcorne as it was a secret, but said that in matters of faith, equivocation could never be lawful. When asked by Salisbury what he would do if the pope excommunicated King James, he [...] "denied to answer". His defence of equivocation was scorned by Coke, who called it [...] "open and broad lying and forswearing". [...] As for Tesimond's confession, the planned assassination had not at that point happened and so Salisbury said that Garnet could easily have alerted the government. [...] Salisbury attacked the idea that it had ever been made under the seal of the confessional, and claimed anyway that Garnet could have warned the authorities after his more ordinary conversation with Catesby about the death of innocents; the priest replied by saying that at the time, he did not understand the relevance of Catesby's questions. The Earl of Northampton said, in Latin, [...] "quod non-prohibet cum potest, jubet" [...] (what <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>does</b> not forbid when he can, he orders). Garnet's defence, that he had forbidden Catesby from proceeding, was futile.|$|E

[...] etc. Vivekananda felt, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>does</b> not have any right to do this or venture so far, and any woman should not permit this as well.

2500|$|It is {{not only}} among us, who are marked {{with the name of}} Christ, that the dignity of faith is great; all the {{business}} of the world, even of those outside the Church, is accomplished by faith.

By faith, agriculture is sustained; for <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>does</b> not endure the toil involved unless he believes he will reap a harvest.

2500|$|Robert Winston, {{a pioneer}} of {{in-vitro}} fertilization, told London's Sunday Times that [...] "male pregnancy would certainly be possible" [...] by having an embryo implanted in a man's abdomen – with the placenta attached to an internal organ such as the bowel – and later delivered by Caesarean section. Ectopic implantation of the embryo along the abdominal wall, and resulting placenta growth would, however, be very dangerous and potentially fatal for the host, and is therefore unlikely to be studied in humans. Gillian Lockwood, medical director of Midland Fertility Services, a British fertility clinic, noted that the abdomen is not designed to separate from the placenta during delivery, hence the danger of an ectopic pregnancy.

2500|$|Resulting trusts in English law are trusts created where {{property}} is not properly disposed of. It {{comes from the}} Latin resultare, meaning to spring back, and was defined by Megarry VC as [...] "essentially a property concept; any property that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>does</b> not effectually dispose of remains his own". These trusts come in two forms: [...] automatic resulting trusts, and presumed resulting trusts. Automatic resulting trusts arise from a [...] "gap" [...] in the equitable title of property. The equitable maxim [...] "equity abhors a vacuum" [...] is followed: it is against principle {{for a piece of}} property to have no owner. As such, the courts assign the property to somebody in a resulting trust to avoid this becoming an issue. They occur in one of four situations: where there is no declaration of trust, where an express trust fails, where there is surplus property, or upon the dissolution of an unincorporated association. Rules differ depending on the situation and the type of original trust under dispute; failed charitable trusts, for example, have the property reapplied in a different way from other forms of trust.|$|E

2500|$|Ashanti {{was first}} noticed by Irv Gotti {{because of her}} vocal skills. Ashanti {{initially}} asked him to produce a few demo songs for her to record so she could say she had some strong tracks by the big time producer but Gotti had a different idea. He asked her to pen hooks for his rap artists and to perform with them in duets. Ashanti provided the melodic response to their call. Ashanti was first featured as a background vocalist on rapper Big Pun's song [...] "How We Roll". In the same year, Ashanti was featured on fellow labelmate Cadillac Tah's singles [...] "Pov City Anthem" [...] and [...] "Just Like a Thug". She also appeared on the 2001 The Fast and the Furious soundtrack as a featured artist on Vita's 2001 hip hop remake of Madonna's [...] "Justify My Love" [...] and on the solo track [...] "When <b>a</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Does</b> Wrong". She was featured on Fat Joe's [...] "What's Luv?" [...] and Ja Rule's [...] "Always on Time". [...] "What's Luv?" [...] and [...] "Always on Time" [...] were released simultaneously and became {{two of the biggest}} hit songs of 2002.

2500|$|The name {{resulting}} trust {{comes from the}} Latin resultare, meaning to spring back. It was defined in [...] Re Sick and Funeral Society of St John's Sunday School, Golcar, where Megarry VC stated that [...] "A {{resulting trust}} is essentially a property concept; any property that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>does</b> not effectually dispose of remains his own". In Re Vandervell's Trusts (No 2), he divided them into two categories; presumed resulting trusts, which are created by the presumed intention of the transferor of property, and automatic resulting trusts, which arise regardless of the transferor's intention whenever he has failed {{to dispose of the}} beneficial interest. Lord Browne-Wilkinson, in Westdeutsche Landesbank v Islington London Borough Council, disagreed with Megarry's classification. While he agreed there were two categories, he felt the dividing line was not based on intention, and the classes were [...] "where A makes a voluntary payment to B or pays (wholly or in part) for the purchase of property which is vested either in B alone or in the joint names of A and B" [...] and [...] "Where A transfers property to B on express trusts, but the trusts declared do not exhaust the whole beneficial interest", with both involving a presumption of intention. It is possible to argue that Quistclose trusts are also a category of resulting trusts, but their classification is the subject of much debate and remains ambiguous.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Johanan said in {{the name}} of Rabbi Simeon ben Jehozadak that it was {{resolved}} by a majority vote in the upper chambers of the house of Nithza in Lydda that in every other law of the Torah, if a person is forced to choose between transgressing the commandment and death, he may transgress and not die, excepting idolatry, incest (including adultery), and murder. The Gemara questioned whether that would mean that one could practice idolatry to avoid being killed. Rabbi Ishmael taught that if a person is forced to choose between idolatry and death, the person should do so, and not be killed, for [...] says, [...] "You shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, which if <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>does,</b> he shall live in them" [...] — not die by them. The Gemara questioned whether one might think that idolatry may even be practiced openly, [...] says, [...] "Neither shall you profane My Holy Name; but I will be hallowed," [...] and as the public violation of commandments profanes God’s Name, one might think that one must die to avoid doing so. The Sages ruled with Rabbi Eliezer, who cited [...] "And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, and with all your might." [...] Rabbi Eliezer taught that since [...] says, [...] "with all your soul," [...] there must be a reason that [...] also says, [...] "with all your might ," [...] and vice versa. stated? Rabbi Eliezer taught that [...] says, [...] "with all your soul" [...] for the person to whom life is more precious than wealth, and [...] says, [...] "with all your soul" [...] to teach that one must be prepared even to give one’s life in God’s service; while to one to whom wealth is more precious than life [...] says, [...] "with all your might" [...] (that is, wealth). [...] Thus the Sages decided that one must incur a martyr's death rather than practice idolatry, for [...] "and you shall love the Lord your God," [...] means that one must not worship any other in God’s place.|$|E
