5|$|In the 1995 {{compilation}} Children <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Politics</b> <b>of</b> Culture, anthropologist Vivienne Wee {{analyzed the}} perception of children by adults and how it supported the concept of children's rights. Wee wrote that in this model (which she called the European pattern), children were seen as defenseless, unadulterated, {{and in need of}} protection by authoritative adults. According to Wee, this European pattern led to the idea that children required the sanctuary of the United Nations Charter and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.|$|E

5|$|During sessions, {{members may}} speak after being called {{on by the}} President. Members of the Council or Commission may also attend and speak in debates. Partly due {{to the need for}} translation, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>politics</b> <b>of</b> {{consensus}} in the chamber, debates tend to be calmer and more polite than, say, the Westminster system. Voting is conducted primarily by a show of hands, that may be checked on request by electronic voting. Votes of MEPs are not recorded in either case, however; that only occurs when there is a roll-call ballot. This is required for the final votes on legislation and also whenever a political group or 30 MEPs request it. The number of roll-call votes has increased with time. Votes can also be a completely secret ballot (for example, when the president is elected). All recorded votes, along with minutes and legislation, are recorded in the Official Journal of the European Union and can be accessed online. Votes usually do not follow a debate, but rather they are grouped with other due votes on specific occasions, usually at noon on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays. This is because the length of the vote is unpredictable and if it continues for longer than allocated it can disrupt other debates and meetings later in the day.|$|E
