5|$|A second {{hindrance}} to Sicilian architects' fully achieving {{their potential}} earlier was that frequently {{they were only}} rebuilding a damaged structure, {{and as a consequence}} having to match their designs to what had been before, or remained. The Cathedral of San Giorgio at Modica (Illustration 10) is an example. It was badly damaged in the earthquake of 1613, rebuilt in 1643 in a Baroque style while keeping the medieval layout, then damaged again in 1693. Rebuilding again began in 1702, by an unknown architect. Finally, Rosario Gagliardi oversaw the façade's completion in 1760, but the compromises he had to make in deference to the existing structure are obvious. While Gagliardi used the same formulae he used so successfully at the church of San Giorgio in Ragusa, here in Modica the building is heavier, and lacks his usual lightness of touch <b>and</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> design.|$|E
5|$|Frederick grew {{up during}} a tumultuous {{political}} period as {{the concept of}} liberalism in Germany, which evolved during the 1840s, was gaining widespread and enthusiastic support. The liberals sought a unified Germany and were constitutional monarchists who desired a constitution to ensure equal protection under the law, the protection of property, and the safeguarding of basic civil rights. Overall, the liberals desired a government ruled by popular representation. When Frederick was 17, these emergent nationalistic and liberal sentiments sparked a series of political uprisings across the German states and elsewhere in Europe. In Germany, their goal was to protect freedoms, such as the freedom of assembly <b>and</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> the press, {{and to create a}} German parliament and constitution. Although the uprisings ultimately brought about no lasting changes, liberal sentiments remained an influential force in German politics throughout Frederick's life.|$|E
5|$|In {{his review}} of the Director's Cut, IGN's Brian Albert, despite noting {{inconsistencies}} in enemy behavior, shared much of his praised with the original version {{in addition to the}} added gameplay mechanics and improved boss battles. GameSpot's VanOrd again noted dated facial animations and poor AI, but generally praised other aspects of the Director's Cut, particularly pointing out the improvements to boss battles. Bramwell, again writing for Eurogamer, particularly praised the revamped boss battles and the inclusion of additional content such as The Missing Link that did not function properly as a standalone release. He also echoed much of his praise for the original game. Michael Gapper of Official Nintendo Magazine stated that all the changes made to the game for the Director's Cut had improved it for the better, praising its gameplay balance <b>and</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> choice in addition to the new features.|$|E

5|$|On the Swabian side, similar {{concerns}} existed. For {{the common people}} in Swabia, the independence <b>and</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> the Eidgenossen was a powerful and attractive role model. Many a baron in southern Swabia feared that his own subjects might revolt and seek adherence to the Swiss Confederacy. These fears were not entirely without foundation: the Swiss had begun to form alliances north of the Rhine river, concluding a first treaty with Schaffhausen in 1454 and then also treaties with cities {{as far away as}} Rottweil (1463) or Mulhouse (1466).|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 27 February 1933, the Reichstag {{building}} was set afire and Marinus van der Lubbe, a Dutch communist, {{was found guilty of}} starting the blaze. Hitler proclaimed that the arson marked the start of a communist uprising. Violent suppression of communists by the Sturmabteilung (SA) was undertaken {{all over the country and}} four thousand members of the Communist Party of Germany were arrested. The Reichstag Fire Decree, imposed on 28 February 1933, rescinded most German civil liberties, including rights of assembly <b>and</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> the press. The decree also allowed the police to detain people indefinitely without charges or a court order. The legislation was accompanied by a propaganda blitz that led to public support for the measure.|$|E
5|$|Oswaldo Payá Sardiñas (29 February 1952– 22 July 2012) was a Cuban {{political}} activist. A Roman Catholic, {{he founded}} the Christian Liberation Movement in 1987 to oppose the one-party rule of the Cuban Communist Party. He attracted international attention for organizing a petition drive known as the Varela Project, in which 25,000 signatories petitioned the Cuban government to guarantee freedom of speech <b>and</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> assembly {{as well as to}} institute a multi-party democracy. In recognition of his work, he received the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize and People in Need's Homo Homini Award.|$|E

5|$|The Government's {{adherence}} to secularism {{has been criticized}} in that the unwritten principle of secularism has trumped the constitutional protection of freedom of religion. For instance, in 2002 a controversy arose upon the suspension of four Muslim girls from school when their parents insisted that they wear the tudung (Islamic headscarf) to national schools. Section 61 of the Education Act empowers the Minister for Education to regulate schools, including prohibiting students from wearing anything not forming part of an official school uniform. The parents of the schoolgirls took {{the view that the}} Ministry of Education's school uniform policy was unconstitutional as it violated the girls' freedom of religion under Article 15(1). While the parents eventually did not pursue legal proceedings against the Ministry, the controversy showed the Singapore Government's steadfastness in insisting on secularism and the difficulties in reconciling secularism <b>and</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> religion in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia NAACP {{filed suit}} {{in federal court in}} 1956 to have the five barratry, champerty, and {{maintenance}} laws thrown out as an unconstitutional infringement of the 1st Amendment rights of freedom of speech <b>and</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> assembly. A three-judge panel of a U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia agreed that three of the laws were unconstitutional, but reserved judgment on the other two laws pending interpretation by state courts (which had not yet ruled on the laws' legality). Both the state and the NAACP appealed. In Harrison v. NAACP, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-to-3 that the district court should have withheld judgment until state courts had considered the issue first.|$|E

5|$|The book's {{central theme}} {{is a warning}} that, in times of strife and {{increased}} fear, {{there is a danger}} of repression and suppression of dissent by those in government who seek to limit freedom of speech. In an interview with the author, Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine wrote that American politics has frequently used fear to justify repression. Lewis pointed out to Solomon that, under the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918, individuals who protested against President Woodrow Wilson's sending of soldiers to Russia were tried and given a twenty-year jail sentence. The author explained that his motivation for writing the book was to recognize the unparalleled civil liberties in the U.S., including freedom of speech <b>and</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> the press. He identified reductions in freedoms of citizens as a result of governmental action taken after the September 11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} abuses of media rights and access. The Zimbabwean {{government}} {{is accused of}} suppressing {{freedom of the press}} <b>and</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> speech. It has been repeatedly accused of using the public broadcaster, the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation, as a propaganda tool. Newspapers critical of the government, such as the Daily News, closed after bombs exploded at their offices and the government refused to renew their license. BBC News, Sky News, and CNN were banned from filming or reporting from Zimbabwe. In 2009 reporting restrictions on the BBC and CNN were lifted. Sky News continue to report on happenings within Zimbabwe from neighbouring countries like South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Writing for the Hartford Courant, Bill Williams {{stated that}} the book should be {{mandatory}} reading for {{high school and college}} students.

Writing for The Christian Science Monitor, Chuck Leddy noted that the author helps readers understand the importance of freedom of speech in a democracy, especially during a period of military conflict when there is increased controversy over the appropriateness of dissent and open dialogue.|$|E

5|$|Articles 14(1)(a) and (b) of the Constitution of Singapore {{respectively}} guarantee {{freedom of}} speech and expression <b>and</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> assembly to Singapore citizens. However, the PEMA and POA, which require permits to be obtained before public meetings and assemblies can be held, were enacted pursuant to exceptions to these rights. Article 14(2)(a) provides that Parliament may by law restrict the right to free speech to protect, among other things, Singapore's security and public order, and to prevent incitement to any criminal offence. Under Article 14(2)(b), the right of assembly may also be limited for public order reasons. As Speakers' Corner was intended to increase avenues available for the exercise of free speech, the pieces of subsidiary legislation regulating the venue were issued to provide that public speaking and demonstrations there are not subject to the PEMA and POA if the conditions specified in the subsidiary legislation are complied with. Speakers' Corner has been criticized as a token gesture, though others have pointed to its use by civil society activists as evidence that it has widened the political space in Singapore.|$|E
5|$|By December 1966 some Australian officers, {{including}} Lieutenant Colonel John Warr, the 5 RAR commanding officer, {{had begun}} to reassess their operational aims. Warr argued that they should move away from conventional operations and instead focus on population control and disrupting communist supply lines <b>and</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> movement. Assessing that with just two infantry battalions 1 ATF {{did not have the}} strength to destroy the Viet Cong forces then in Phuoc Tuy, Warr favoured cordon and search operations to eliminate cadres and block the supply of rice from the villages. On 7 January 1967, Brigadier David Jackson was replaced as Commander 1 ATF by Brigadier Stuart Graham, and he subsequently approved Warr's proposed concept of operations. Two days later 5 RAR conducted a successful cordon and search of the village of Binh Ba as part of Operation Caloundra, screening 1,500 villagers and interrogating 591. Nine confirmed members of the Viet Cong were captured, while five draft dodgers were also detained. By mid-afternoon the operation had concluded without a shot being fired.|$|E
5|$|Freedom of Speech was {{the first}} of a series of four oil paintings, {{entitled}} Four Freedoms, painted by Norman Rockwell. The works were inspired by United States President, Franklin D. Roosevelt in a State of the Union Address, known as Four Freedoms, delivered to the 77th United States Congress on January 6, 1941. Of the Four Freedoms, the only two described in the United States Constitution were freedom of speech <b>and</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> worship. The Four Freedoms' theme was eventually incorporated into the Atlantic Charter, and it became part of the charter of the United Nations. The series of paintings ran in The Saturday Evening Post accompanied by essays from noted writers on four consecutive weeks: Freedom of Speech (February 20), Freedom of Worship (February 27), Freedom from Want (March 6) and Freedom from Fear (March 13). Eventually, the series became widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the U. S. Government War Bond Drive.|$|E
