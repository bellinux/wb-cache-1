50|$|By August 1955, Japan Science and Industry Co., Ltd. was {{established}} as {{a joint venture with}} a major toy manufacturer, and an automatic <b>armature</b> coil <b>winding</b> apparatus was developed, thereby expanding production capacity to 30,000 motors per day. The machines were exceptionally loud but resulted in lower prices and cheaper toys for the children of Japan. But in September 1957, American newspapers reported that lead based paints were used on some toys imported from Japan. The Japanese toy industry was hit by a sharp drop in demand. The Mabuchi brothers, however, seized on this development as an opportunity to break away from their exclusive relationship with the toy manufacturer.|$|R

Finite element analysis (FEA) and equivalent circuit models are used to determine the levels of the magnetic saturation in the motors; calculate torque, inductance, and electromotive force (EMF); and determine the distribution of losses in the machine. The results show that the powder iron armature machine has lower back EMF and torque constants, and is less efficient than the steel laminations machine, which is due to the lower permeability and saturation flux density of the powder iron material...|$|R

40|$|Wound-field switched-flux {{machines}} (WFSFM) have {{an intrinsic}} simplicity and high speed {{that make them}} well suited to many hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) applications. However, overlap armature and field windings raised the copper losses in these machines.

The winding proceed till all the conductors are connected.|$|E
50|$|A {{commutator}} {{consists of}} a set of contact bars fixed to the rotating shaft of a machine, and connected to the armature windings. As the shaft rotates, the commutator reverses the flow of current in a winding. For a single <b>armature</b> <b>winding,</b> when the shaft has made one-half complete turn, the winding is now connected so that current flows through it in the opposite of the initial direction. In a motor, the armature current causes the fixed magnetic field to exert a rotational force, or a torque, on the winding to make it turn. In a generator, the mechanical torque applied to the shaft maintains the motion of the <b>armature</b> <b>winding</b> through the stationary magnetic field, inducing a current in the winding. In both the motor and generator case, the commutator periodically reverses the direction of current flow through the winding so that current flow in the circuit external to the machine continues in only one direction.|$|E

50|$|Neglecting losses, the {{difference}} between the mechanical and electrical torque gives the net accelerating torque Ta. In the steady state, the electrical torque is equal to the mechanical torque and hence the accelerating power is zero. During this period the rotor moves at synchronous speed ωs in rad/s. The electric torque Te corresponds to the net air-gap power in the machine and thus accounts for the total output power of the generator plus I2R losses in the <b>armature</b> <b>winding.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{speed of}} a DC motor can be {{increased}} by field weakening. Reducing the field strength is done by inserting resistance in series with a shunt field, or inserting resistances around a series-connected field winding, to reduce current in the field winding. When the field is weakened, the back-emf reduces, so a larger current flows through the <b>armature</b> <b>winding</b> and this increases the speed. Field weakening is not used on its own but {{in combination with other}} methods, such as series-parallel control.|$|E
50|$|A shunt {{generator}} {{is a type}} {{of direct}} current electric generator in which field winding and <b>armature</b> <b>winding</b> are connected in parallel, and in which the armature supplies both the load current and the field current. A direct current (DC) generator, not using a permanent magnet, requires a DC field current for excitation. The field may be separately excited by a source of DC, such as a battery, or self excited by being connected to the armature of the generator so that the generator also provides the energy required for the field current.|$|E
50|$|High {{frequency}} alternators of the variable-reluctance type {{were applied}} commercially to radio transmission in the low-frequency radio bands. These {{were used for}} transmission of Morse code and, experimentally, for transmission of voice and music. In the Alexanderson alternator, both the field winding and <b>armature</b> <b>winding</b> are stationary, and current is induced in the armature {{by virtue of the}} changing magnetic reluctance of the rotor (which has no windings or current carrying parts). Such machines were made to produce radio frequency current for radio transmissions, although the efficiency was low.|$|E
5000|$|The {{field coils}} are {{connected}} in series or {{parallel with the}} <b>armature</b> <b>winding.</b> When the generator first starts to turn, {{the small amount of}} remanent magnetism present in the iron core provides a magnetic field to get it started, generating a small current in the armature. This flows through the field coils, creating a larger magnetic field which generates a larger armature current. This [...] "bootstrap" [...] process continues until the magnetic field in the core levels off due to saturation and the generator reaches a steady state power output.|$|E
50|$|The Magnicon, {{developed}} by Macfarlane's in Scotland, {{is similar to}} the Metadyne, but whereas the latter has a two-pole <b>armature</b> <b>winding,</b> the Magnicon has a four-pole lap winding, and is sometimes referred to a Metadyne with a short-pitched <b>armature</b> <b>winding.</b> They have been supplied to operate hoists and winches on ships. The stator of a Magnicon has four polar projections, spaced at 90 degrees, and one pair of them is excited. The pair of brushes which are on the same axis as the excited poles are short-circuited, resulting in a large current. The magnetomotive force (MMF) of this current acts on the non-excited poles, creating a working flux (Φ) and the output voltage. As with a full-pitch Metadyne, the armature reaction of the output current is 90 degrees out of phase, and therefore opposes the original excitation. Advantages over the normal Metadyne are that the number of exciting and compensating coils is halved to two each per cycle, and the shorter pitch of the coils results in less overhang at the ends of the windings. However, the design creates idle currents in the armature, which result in losses, and on larger machines, where interpoles are required, each interpole must be fitted with two coils, one for each of the brush circuits. Tustin argues that there is little advantage of the Magnicon over the Metadyne for smaller machines, and for larger machines, which require interpoles to be fitted, insufficient analysis has been carried out to make a judgement.|$|E
50|$|One useful {{property}} {{of having the}} field windings in series with the <b>armature</b> <b>winding</b> is that as the speed increases the counter EMF naturally reduces the voltage across, and current through the field windings, giving field weakening at high speeds. This means that the motor has no theoretical maximum speed for any particular applied voltage. Universal motors can be and are generally run at high speeds, 4000-16000 rpm, and can go over 20,000 rpm. By way of contrast, AC synchronous and squirrel cage induction motors cannot turn a shaft faster than allowed by the power line frequency. In countries with 60 Hz(cycle/Sec) AC supply, this speed is limited to 3600 RPM.|$|E
50|$|The rotor {{is a large}} magnet with poles {{constructed}} of steel lamination projecting out of the rotor’s core. The poles are supplied by direct current or magnetized by permanent magnets. The armature with a three-phase winding is attached to three slip rings with brushes riding on them and mounted on the shaft. The field winding is wound on the rotor which produces the magnetic field and the <b>armature</b> <b>winding</b> is on the stator where voltage is induced. Direct current (DC), from an external exciter or from a diode bridge mounted on the rotor shaft, produces a magnetic field and energizes the rotating field windings and alternating current energizes the armature windings simultaneously.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{majority}} of designs the rotating assembly {{in the center of}} the generator—the [...] "rotor"—contains the magnet, and the [...] "stator" [...] is the stationary armature that is electrically connected to a load. As shown in the diagram, the perpendicular component of the stator field affects the torque while the parallel component affects the voltage. The load supplied by the generator determines the voltage. If the load is inductive, then the angle between the rotor and stator fields will be greater than 90 degrees which corresponds to an increased generator voltage. This is known as an overexcited generator. The opposite is true for a generator supplying a capacitive load which is known as an underexcited generator. A set of three conductors make up the <b>armature</b> <b>winding</b> in standard utility equipment, constituting three phases of a power circuit—that correspond to the three wires we are accustomed to see on transmission lines. The phases are wound such that they are 120 degrees apart spatially on the stator, providing for a uniform force or torque on the generator rotor. The uniformity of the torque arises because the magnetic fields resulting from the induced currents in the three conductors of the <b>armature</b> <b>winding</b> combine spatially in such a way as to resemble the magnetic field of a single, rotating magnet. This stator magnetic field or [...] "stator field" [...] appears as a steady rotating field and spins at the same frequency as the rotor when the rotor contains a single dipole magnetic field. The two fields move in [...] "synchronicity" [...] and maintain a fixed position relative to each other as they spin.|$|E
5000|$|DC motor {{consists}} of two parts i.e. rotor and stator. Stator {{consists of}} field winding while rotor (also called armature) consists of <b>armature</b> <b>winding.</b> When both armature and field are excited by DC supply, current flows through windings and magnetic flux proportional to the current is produced. When the flux of field interacts with the flux of armature, it results in motion of the rotor.Armature control {{is the most common}} control technique for DC motors. In order to implement this control, the flux is required to be kept constant[...] To this aim, either the stator voltage is constant or the stator coils are replaced by a permanent magnet. In the latter case, the motor {{is said to be a}} permanent magnet DC motor and is driven by means of the only armature coils.|$|E
50|$|A {{coil of wire}} {{rotating}} in {{a magnetic}} field produces a current which changes direction with each 180° rotation, an alternating current (AC). However many early uses of electricity required direct current (DC). In the first practical electric generators, called dynamos, the AC was converted into DC with a commutator, a set of rotating switch contacts on the armature shaft. The commutator reversed the connection of the <b>armature</b> <b>winding</b> to the circuit every 180° rotation of the shaft, creating a pulsing DC current. One of the first dynamos was built by Hippolyte Pixii in 1832. The dynamo was the first electrical generator capable of delivering power for industry. The Woolrich Electrical Generator of 1844, now in Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum, is the earliest electrical generator used in an industrial process.

It was {{subsequently}} taken over by his son and activities soon included the repair of electric motors and machines and the installation of lighting and power systems. The company developed further when, in 1954, Theodor's daughter Marianne opened an electrical retail business in Ahlen and then in 1964 when an engineering office and switchgear manufacturing firm were also incorporated into the group. These affiliates were merged in 1966 to form 'Blumenbecker KG'. In 1982 the Group was split into the holding company 'Blumenbecker KG' and the operating company 'B+M Blumenbecker GmbH'. Restructuring in 2004 then created a total of 20 largely independent companies with numerous sites and offices in Germany, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Ukraine, India, the United States, China and Italy.|$|E
50|$|The {{revolving}} part of alternators {{can be the}} armature or the magnetic field. The revolving armature type has the armature wound on the rotor, where the winding moves through a stationary magnetic field. The revolving armature type is not often used. The revolving field type has magnetic field on the rotor to rotate through a stationary <b>armature</b> <b>winding.</b> The advantage is that then the rotor circuit carries much less power than the armature circuit, making the slip ring connections smaller and less costly; only two contacts are needed for the direct-current rotor, whereas often a rotor winding has three phases and multiple sections which would each require a slip ring connection. The stationary armature can be wound for any convenient medium voltage level, up {{to tens of thousands}} of volts; manufacture of slip ring connections for more than a few thousand volts is costly and inconvenient.|$|E
