5|$|Martin Varno's {{dissatisfaction with}} the Cormans {{eventually}} led him to take them into formal <b>arbitration</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Although Varno was {{not a member of}} the Writers Guild of America when he wrote the Blood Beast script, he was encouraged by actor Jay Jostyn to discuss the matter with them. According to Varno, Jostyn claimed several actors and writers had similar problems with the Cormans in the past, but were not taking action because the Cormans provided them continued work in their films. After meeting with the Writers Guild, Varno became a member and filed arbitration papers against the Cormans for not paying him enough. Roger Corman was in the process of editing the film when he received the arbitration notice, and he became so angry he started screaming and throwing things in the cutting room. Varno claims one of the film crew members approached him (Varno) and promised that the Cormans would hire Varno to work on many of their future films if he dropped the matter, but Varno refused.|$|E

25|$|Arbitration in its {{common law}} form {{developed}} in England; in the Middle Ages, tribunals {{such as the}} Courts of the Boroughs, of the Fair and of the Staple arose as the Royal Courts were not designed for trade disputes, and trade with foreigners was otherwise unenforceable. In the mid-16th century, common law courts developed contract law and the Admiralty court became accessible for disputes with foreign merchants, broadening the venues for trade disputes. Courts became suspicious of arbitration; for example, in Kill v. Hollister (1746), an English {{court ruled that the}} arbitration agreement could 'oust' courts of law and equity of jurisdiction. Merchants, however, retained provisions to settle disputes among themselves, but tension between the <b>arbitration</b> <b>proceedings</b> and courts eventually resulted in the Common Law Procedure Act 1854 which provided for the appointment of arbitrators and umpires, allowed courts to 'stay proceedings' when a disputant filed a suit despite an agreement to arbitrate, and provided a process for arbitrators to submit questions to a court. Later, the Arbitration Act 1889 was passed, followed by other Arbitration Acts in 1950, 1975, 1979 and 1996. Arbitration Act 1979 in particular limited judicial review for arbitration awards.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a debate in the European Union over the need to provide a {{transparent}} and predictable interface between international arbitration and cross-border litigation. That debate has recently culminated in the issuance of the Recast Brussels Regulation (the Recast), effective January 10, 2015.

Parallel proceedings occur when a party that had agreed to arbitrate nonetheless goes to court while the other party proceeds with <b>arbitration.</b> These parallel <b>proceedings</b> undermine the effectiveness of arbitration because of increased cost, inefficiency, and delay, as well as the high risk of inconsistent judgments.

Arbitration is not a new phenomenon, much of its development has taken place in the 19 th century, when alongside with arbitration ad hoc an institutional arbitration has also been created and permanent arbitration courts were established. The best known permanent arbitration court is undoubtedly the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris.

Certain terms relating to arbitration are defined in the first chapter in particular the concept of international commercial arbitration. The question of arbitrability, ie. admissibility of arbitration, is also addressed there. In the second chapter the types of arbitration are analyzed - ad hoc and institutional arbitration, facultative and obligatory arbitration, traditional and online arbitration, international and domestic arbitration; as well as different types of arbitration agreements - agreement on an arbitrator, the arbitration clause, unlimited compromise, asymmetric, pathological and combined arbitration clause.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{possible}} use of arbitration in disputes involving claims against directors. It takes as its starting point a recent decision of the English Court of Appeal, Fulham Football Club [1987] Ltd v. Richards, in which the Court confirmed the enforceability of an <b>arbitration</b> agreement in <b>proceedings</b> where one of the defendants was the company chairman, and asks how far this case is representative of a general trend. Design/methodology/approach – The methodology adopted is comparative, with particular but not exclusive reference to laws in the USA, the UK, France and Germany. The paper examines case law and literature in three intersecting areas. First, it notes the existence of distinctive approaches to corporate governance which broadly correspond to those of common law and civil law (outsider and insider) jurisdictions. Second, it reviews the relative significance in different jurisdictions of public and private law mechanisms for enforcing compliance with the rules designed to ensure good governance. Finally, to the extent that private enforcement is relevant, it explores how far intra-corporate disputes are considered arbitrable in the selected jurisdictions. Findings – It is apparent that the function performed by claims against directors in some jurisdictions – notably the USA and to a lesser extent the UK – is performed by other mechanisms elsewhere. In Germany, for example, actions for the annulment of company resolutions are a common form of intra-corporate dispute. A trend towards the use of arbitration to resolve intra-corporate disputes can be observed, but this may be limited to cases where there is a desire to preserve the relationship between the parties – which is frequently not the case where claims against directors are involved. Where that relationship is already damaged beyond repair, litigation may offer greater advantages. Research limitations/implications – There is, nevertheless, a lack of empirical data as to the actual use of arbitration – as compared to litigation – in intra-corporate disputes in the jurisdictions under consideration. Originality/value – The main value of this paper is thus to clarify the parameters of a field for further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Unlike law-related feature films, law-related {{documentary}} or nonfiction {{films have}} rarely {{been the subject}} of legal scholarship, nor have they been extensively used as teaching tools throughout the law school curriculum. The lack of interest in such films is explained by a number of popular misconceptions about documentaries, such as their “genre-lessness” or the lack of common threads running through the films that facilitate critical reception; the elusive nature of documentary truth; the films’ fixation on victimization and by necessity the exploitation of the films’ subjects; and the lack of practical payoff for law students and lawyers from critically studying documentaries and the process by which they are produced. This Article addresses those misconceptions. First, it identifies a body of nonfiction film work that might be characterized as “law-genre” documentaries in that they tell “real” or “true” stories as to which the law is the point of departure, a central organizing theme, or most importantly such an important consideration affecting the advancement of the chronicle or story that the subject matter might reasonably be characterized as “law as a lived experience. ” Second, the Article argues that critical analysis of this body of work should not entail an elusive search for truth. Rather “reflexivity” is the key to assessing a documentary’s value or quality. A good documentary will present its subjects as deeply contextualized, socially connected, and individually complex beings who are reflexive or introspective about their own situation and the filming of it. The filmmaker will be reflexive or self-critical about the people and the circumstances she or he is filming, as well as reflexive about the process by which she or he has interpreted reality {{for the benefit of the}} audience. Finally, the audience should be provoked to be reflexive about its possible involvement in the lives of the subjects or the circumstances portrayed in the film. Third, with regard to many documentary films, the quality of the finished product and the reception they receive will depend on what happened during their making, particularly with regard to access to venues, permission to use copyrighted material, and the treatment of subjects. Because of these concerns, law and lawyers are also playing an increasingly important role in the creative process of documentary film production. Lawyers, then, are not just the subjects and the viewers of documentary films; they are inextricably engaged in their making. Finally, lawyers are now producing visual legal advocacy on behalf of clients. For example, lawyers are using the narrative styles of documentaries to generate arguments on film on behalf of death-row inmates seeking clemency and personal injury claimants seeking damages in <b>arbitration</b> and mediation <b>proceedings.</b> An enhanced ability to engage in visual legal advocacy is likely to provide the biggest payoff for scholars and students who seriously pursue the study of law-genre documentaries...|$|R
