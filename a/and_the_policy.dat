5|$|In general, {{like with}} many of the New Trade Theory models, the results of the Brander Spencer model <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> {{prescriptions}} it generates are very sensitive to the underlying assumptions {{on the nature of the}} industry in question, the information available to the national government, its ability to credibly commit to an action and the likely response of foreign governments. Some of these criticisms were already noted by Brander and Spencer in their paper, where they advised caution.|$|E
5|$|After the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679), {{the navy}} {{was used to}} hijack Swedish ships in the Baltic Sea, and in 1680, six Brandenburg-Prussian vessels {{captured}} the Spanish vessel Carolus Secundus near Oostende to pressure Spain to pay promised subsidies. The Spanish ship was renamed Markgraf von Brandenburg ("Margrave of Brandenburg") and became the flagship of an Atlantic fleet that was ordered to capture Spanish vessels carrying silver; it was not successful in this mission. In the following years, the navy was expanded, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> of leasing ships {{was replaced by the}} policy of building or purchasing them. On 1 October 1684 Frederick William bought all ships that had been leased for 110,000 talers. Also in 1684, the East Frisian port of Emden replaced Pillau as the main Brandenburg-Prussian naval base. From Pillau, part of the shipyard, the admiral's house and the wooden church of the employees was transferred to Emden. While Emden was not part of Brandenburg-Prussia, the elector owned a nearby castle, Greetsiel, and negotiated an agreement with the town to maintain a garrison and a port.|$|E
5|$|The first schools {{offering}} Western-style {{education in}} the presidency were established in Madras during the 18th century. In 1822, a Board of Public Instruction was created based on the recommendations of Sir Thomas Munro, after which schools teaching students in vernacular language was established. A central training school {{was set up in}} Madras as per Munro's scheme. However, this system appeared to be a failure <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>policy</b> was altered in 1836 in order to promote European literature and science. The Board of Public Instruction was superseded by a Committee for Native Education. In January 1840, during the viceroyalty of Lord Ellenborough, a University Board was established with Alexander J. Arbuthnot as the Joint Director of Public Instruction. The central school was converted to a high school in April 1841 with 67 students and in 1853 became the Presidency College {{with the addition of a}} college department. On 5 September 1857, the University of Madras was established as an examining body using the University of London as a model with the first examinations held in February 1858. C. W. Thamotharam Pillai and Caroll V. Visvanatha Pillai of Ceylon were the first to graduate from the University. Sir S. Subramaniya Iyer was the first Indian Vice-Chancellor of the University.|$|E
