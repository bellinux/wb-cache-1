In Woolley et al.'s two initial studies, groups worked together on different tasks from the McGrath Task Circumplex, a well-established taxonomy of group tasks. Tasks were chosen from all four quadrants of the circumplex and included visual puzzles, brainstorming, making collective moral judgments, and negotiating over limited resources. The results in these tasks were taken to conduct <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> <b>analysis.</b> Both studies showed support for a general collective intelligence factor c underlying differences in group performance with an initial eigenvalue accounting for 43% (44% in study 2) of the variance, whereas the next factor accounted for only 18% (20%). That fits the range normally found in research regarding a general individual intelligence factor g typically accounting for 40% to 50% percent of between-individual performance differences on cognitive tests.|$|E

50|$|In <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> <b>analysis</b> of {{the latest}} wave (6) of World Values Survey data, Arno Tausch (Corvinus University Budapest) found that family values in the {{tradition}} of Joseph Alois Schumpeter and religious values in the research tradition of Robert Barro can be an important positive asset for society. Negative phenomena, like the distrust in the state of law; the shadow economy; the distance from altruistic values; a growing fatigue of democracy; and the lack of entrepreneurial spirit are all correlated with the loss of religiosity. Tausch based his results on <b>a</b> <b>factor</b> <b>analysis</b> with promax rotation of 78 variables from 45 countries with complete data, and also calculated performance indices for the 45 countries with complete data and the nine main global religious denominations. On this account, Judaism and also Protestantism emerge as most closely combining religion and the traditions of the Enlightenment.|$|E

40|$|The Ruminative Thought Style Questionnaire (RTSQ) is a 20 -item measure {{assessing}} {{a single}} dimension of rumination {{over and above}} valence, temporal orientation of thought content, and the cognitive-affective context in which it occurs.
