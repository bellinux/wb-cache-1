5|$|Motif finding, {{also known}} as profile analysis, is a method of {{locating}} sequence motifs in global MSAs that is both a means of producing a better MSA and a means of producing a scoring matrix for use in searching other sequences for similar motifs. A variety of methods for isolating the motifs have been developed, but <b>all</b> <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> identifying short highly conserved patterns within the larger alignment and constructing a matrix similar to a substitution matrix that reflects the amino acid or nucleotide composition of each position in the putative motif. The alignment can then be refined using these matrices. In standard profile analysis, the matrix includes entries for each possible character as well as entries for gaps. Alternatively, statistical pattern-finding algorithms can identify motifs as a precursor to an MSA {{rather than as a}} derivation. In many cases when the query set contains {{only a small number of}} sequences or contains only highly related sequences, pseudocounts are added to normalize the distribution reflected in the scoring matrix. In particular, this corrects zero-probability entries in the matrix to values that are small but nonzero.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{there is}} no one {{governing}} or official body that regulates, recognizes, or awards national championships in college football, and because many independent selectors of championships exist, many of the claims by the schools listed below are shared, contradict each other, or are controversial. In addition, because {{there is no}} one body overseeing national championships, no standardized requirements exist in order for a school to make a claim on a national championship, as any particular institution is free to make any declaration it deems to be fit. However, all known national championship claims are for seasons in which a National Championship, or share of a championship, was believed to be awarded to that particular school by at least one independent third-party selector. The majority of these claims, but not <b>all,</b> <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> championships awarded from selectors listed as [...] "major" [...] in the official NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision Records. Not all championships awarded by third party selectors, nor those listed in the official NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision Records, are necessarily claimed by each school. Therefore, these claims represent how each individual school sees their own history on the subject of national championships.|$|E

5000|$|Spec RX-7 {{is one of}} many production-based spec classes, {{originating}} in the mid-90's with the Sports Car Club of America. The class was created by Dave Turner and Mark Holland. The main fault of the class is a lack of nationwide compatibility, with each division having slightly different rulesets from one another. Some allow for vast modification, some allow very little, but they <b>all</b> <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the premise of equality, with the skill being placed solely on the driver and reducing the need for costly development and [...] "part of the week". Specs range from relatively stock including exhaust and intake, to mildly modified, to Improved Touring specs. <b>All</b> <b>are</b> <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the 79-85 year model RX-7, with some excluding the 79-80 year models.|$|E
