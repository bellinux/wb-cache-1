500|$|Malone {{credited}} Howarth's versatility {{with the}} reason he was cast as Todd. [...] During a February 1993 interview with Soap Opera Digest (SOD), Howarth stated he was surprised he won the part. [...] "I really don't know how I made it," [...] he said. He met a One Life to Live casting director two years previously, while performing in a New York play, but, when the role of Todd opened up, he [...] "auditioned just like everybody else". He [...] "made it to callbacks, and [...] got the part". Howarth said, [...] "I was hired... to plant drugs in Jason Webb's jacket. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> my first name was Todd. I don't know what happened next. They called me in again and suddenly I had a last name 'Manning.' Then I get called to read another day." ...|$|E

I was new to the life, so I had no reference for what people were talking about, but I soon gathered that [...] "banjee" [...] meant that I wasn't a [...] "queen." [...] Whatever the terms of identification, <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> there was one thing that brought both the banjees and the queens (and whatever lies between) to the pier: we were men who loved men. An anxious 19 year old, I wore my banjee realness designation like a badge of honor. [...] a queen schooled me on how my masculinity was something that carried great weight, not only in the gay world, but the straight world as well.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2013, she {{released}} [...] "Jikele" [...] as the album's third single. Motherland was {{revealed to be}} a 12-track album and when asked why is it taking so long? she commented [...] "One needs to take one's time because good work takes time. But it must be worth the wait in the end." [...] At the 4th City People Awards, 14 July 2013, she lost South South Musician of the Year to fellow Rivers State recording artist Oba Omega; present at the occasion were the celebrities Rita Dominic and Yvonne Nelson from Ghana. Muma Gee competed in the first Imo State intercommunity beauty pageant, representing the community of Umuhu in Ngor Okpala. She came into the competition through her matrimonial union with Eke, whose heritage stems from the Umuhu people. On 1 August 2013, she was named Mrs. Ngor Okpala by first lady of Imo State, Nneoma Nkechi Okorocha, after beating off challenges from 28 other entrants. It was also made known on 23 September 2013, that Muma Gee has commenced a new recording session—possibly for Motherland—with Slim Burna and P Jaydino in the studio. On 15 February 2014, whilst heavily pregnant with her first child, she confirmed {{in a telephone interview}} with Saturday Beats of The Punch that she will be performing at the album launch party for Motherland regardless of her physical condition. On 18 April, just weeks before the anticipated concert, Uwame delivered twins – {{a boy and a girl}} commenting on this Uwame said, [...] "I was not initially expecting twins. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I started getting big and bigger. And people would see me and say, oh, you are looking so beautiful. I didn't believe I was going to have twins." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{he disliked}} me {{and had some}} {{contempt}} for my person. Why? Apparently because his ship had been delayed three hours on my account. Who was I {{to have such a}} thing done for me? Such a thing had never been done for him. It was a sort of jealous indignation.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{paid for}} it. It {{was two years}} and over before I knew what happened. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I was Julian Jones and that I'd been blacklisted in the big strike, and that I was married to Sarah here. I mean that. I didn't know {{anything}} in between, and when Sarah tried to talk about it, it gave me pains in the head. I mean my head was queer, and I knew it was queer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why couldn't {{you leave}} the cat alone?" [...] I shouted at him in idiotic remonstrance, for my brain had gone, and <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{we were about to}} be thrown into the fiery pit. Already I was over it; I felt the flames singe my hair and saw its red caverns {{awaiting}} me, when of a sudden the brutal hands that held me were unloosed and I fell backwards to the ground, where I lay staring upwards.|$|E

He knows that you lodge in the Place des Trois Maries, and that you come here frequently. I would have given my life to warn you then and there," [...] continued the old man with touching earnestness, [...] "but I didn't {{know where to find}} you. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> you were looking after Pierre." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By Aphrodite, or by Isis, {{or both of}} them I did not know. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I {{must seek}} him, then and evermore, as seek I do to-day and shall perchance through æons yet unborn. So I followed, as I was taught and commanded, the sistrum being my guide, how it matters not, and giving me the means, and so at last I came to this ancient land whereof the ruin in which you sit was once known as Kôr." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{replied that}} I was innocent, but that I {{would wait for}} legal {{assistance}} before I defended myself. The justice remanded me and the examination was over. Three days later my unhappy mistress was subjected to the same trial. I {{was not allowed to}} communicate with her. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the lawyer had arrived from London to help her. Toward the evening he was admitted to see me. He shook his head sorrowfully when I asked after my mistress.|$|E

60|$|Here {{and there}} they were scattered, nearly fifty altogether, in that great gulf they had made, {{overtaken}} by a death that must have seemed to them as incomprehensible as any death could be. To me also at that time this death was incomprehensible. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> these things that had been alive and so terrible to men were dead. For a moment I believed that the destruction of Sennacherib had been repeated, that God had repented, that the Angel of Death had slain them in the night.|$|E
60|$|I {{heard the}} engine whistling, and I felt the speed easing down. I knew the train wasn't going to stop, {{but my mind}} was made up to chance it if she slowed down sufficiently. The right of way at this point took a curve, crossed a bridge over a canal, and cut through the town of Bristol. This {{combination}} compelled slow speed. I clung on to the side-ladder and waited. I didn't know it was the town of Bristol we were approaching. I {{did not know what}} necessitated slackening in speed. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I wanted to get off. I strained my eyes in the darkness for a street-crossing on which to land. I was pretty well down the train, and before my car was in the town the engine was past the station and I could feel her making speed again.|$|E
60|$|I now had no plan of action. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I {{could not}} leave America without finding out {{something}} definite about this Barker business. That is to say, if it should be made known to me that instead of attending to my business, sending a carpenter to make repairs, if such were necessary, or going personally to the plumber {{to make sure that}} that erratic personage would give his attention to any pipes in regard to which Mr. Vincent might have written, Barker should mingle in sociable relations with my tenants, and drive or play tennis with the young lady of the house, then would I immediately have done with him. I would withdraw my business from his hands and place it in those of old Mr. Poindexter. More than that, it might be my duty to warn Miss Vincent's parents against Barker. I did not doubt that he was a very good house and land-agent, but in selecting him as such I had no idea of introducing him to the Vincents in a social way. In fact, the more I thought about it the more I became convinced that if ever I mentioned Barker to my tenants it would be to warn them against him. From certain points of view he was actually a dangerous man.|$|E

60|$|Fortunately or {{unfortunately}} her inquisitiveness got {{the better}} of her, and she fell into her native Italian. What were we, where did we come from, where were we going, why were we going, had we any children, did we want any, etc. After every answer she nodded her head and said Ahu! and watched us with energetic dark eyes. Then she ruminated over our nationalities and said, to the unseeing witnesses: Una bella coppia, a fine couple. As at the moment we felt neither beautiful nor coupled, we only looked greener. The grim man-at-arms coming up to ask us again if we weren't going to have a little wine, she lapsed into her ten-pounder French, which was most difficult to follow. And she said that on a sea-voyage one must eat, one must eat, if only a little. But--and she lapsed into Italian--one must by no means drink wine--no--no! One didn't want to, said I sadly. Whereupon the grim man-at-arms, whom, of course, we had cheated out of the bottle we refused to have opened for us, said with a lost sarcasm that wine made a man of a man, etc., etc. I was too weary of that underground, however. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he wanted wine, wine, wine, and we hadn't ordered any. He didn't care for food.|$|E
5000|$|Baeza {{was also}} {{surprised}} by the performance. [...] "I never in any of his races knew how fast he was going," [...] he said. [...] "He moved so smoothly and his action was so fluid I felt like I was in a Lear Jet. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he was going faster {{than the rest of}} them. I'd try to slow him down, but he'd still pull away from them." ...|$|E
5000|$|Huck Magazine writer Jay Riggio both praised and {{described}} his history with Video Days stating [...] "The video {{was almost too}} much to take in. From the mind-blowing skating to the documented personalities of my heroes, absorbing it in small intervals was my only option. I can’t {{go as far as}} to say that I recognized the genius of Video Days off the bat, nor can I say that I even placed much importance on Spike Jonze’s onscreen credit back then - I had only recognized his name from photo credits in skate mags. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Video Days made me want to skate like never before. There was magic in it that to this day seems difficult to place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True, but <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> where. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>is</b> {{that he once}} {{mentioned}} casually in one of {{his letters}} {{that he was going to}} Buenos Ayres, where he had some property." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{remainder}} {{of the story of}} the battle others have told. It is history. I have told what I saw as a young private; I was not seventeen years old. The causes of the discontent and the troubles with Mexico I did not then know. History tells all that. As a boy <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> we had a row on our hands, and they wanted to fight. I thought I could kill Mexicans as easily as I could deer and turkeys. In 1842 I helped General Burleson whip the Comanches at Plum Creek fight, and in 1848, during the Mexican War, I went out again under Claiborne Herbert. Still later, in 1861, I went again, this time to Virginia, and served in Hood's brigade in the Fifth Texas.
