Because of potential differences between species, Nicotiana tabacum guard cells were studied in intact plants, with simultaneous recordings of the plasma membrane conductance and the cytoplasmic free Ca 2 + concentration.

Stomatal closures in leaves induced by the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) and malate were abolished by kinase inhibitors and/or enhanced by okadaic acid.

This modulation of ABA-induced stomatal closing correlated to the large dynamic range for up- and down-regulation of slow <b>anion</b> <b>channels</b> by opposing phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events in guard cells.

The main principle of the proposed mechanism is illustrated by simplified electric and kinetic models. Computational behavior of the kinetic model shows a restriction of the steady-state metabolite flux through the mitochondrial membranes at relatively high concentration of the external ADP. The flux restriction was caused by a decrease of the voltage across the contact sites and by an increase in the outer membrane potential (up to + 60 mV) leading to the closure of the voltage-dependent <b>anion</b> <b>channels</b> localized beyond the contact sites. This mechanism suggests that the outer membrane potential may arrest ATP release through the outer membrane beyond the contact sites, thus tightly coordinating mitochondrial metabolism and aerobic glycolysis in tumor and normal proliferating cells...|$|R

Due to a paucity of specific pharmacological blockers, we investigated the global effect of extracellular chloride substitution on platelet activation using aggregometry and flow cytometry. In the absence of extracellular chloride we observed a modest effect on the maximum aggregation response to thrombin or collagen-related peptide. Although the rate of aggregation was substantially reduced in a manner that was dependent on the extracellular chloride concentration, aggregation in the absence of chloride was noticeably biphasic, indicative of impaired secondary signalling. This was further investigated by targeting secondary agonists with aspirin and apyrase or by blockade of the ADP receptor P 2 Y 12. Under these conditions, the rates of aggregation were comparable to those recorded in the absence of extracellular chloride.

Furthermore, a Ca 2 + influx and the activation of <b>anion</b> <b>channels</b> are part of the ABA-signaling pathway leading to the specific expression of RAB 18.

We also observed that ABA-dependent stimulation of PLD was necessary for the activation of plasma anion current. However, when ABA activation of plasma <b>anion</b> <b>channels</b> was inhibited, the ABA-dependent activation of PLD was unchanged.
