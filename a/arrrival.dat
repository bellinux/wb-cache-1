40|$|A longstanding goal of Akira Tonomura was {{to observe}} Hanbury Brown [...] Twiss anti-correlations between {{electrons}} in a field-emission free electron beam. The experimental results {{were reported in}} his 2011 paper with Tetsuji Kodama and Nobuyuki Osakabe [Phys. Rev. A 83, 063616 (2011) ]. An open issue in such a measurement is whether the observed anti-correlations arise from quantum statistics, or are simply produced by Coulomb repulsion between electrons. In this paper we describe a simple classical model of Coulomb effects to estimate their effects in electron beam interferometry experiments, and conclude that the experiment did indeed observe quantum correlations in the electron <b>arrrival</b> times.
