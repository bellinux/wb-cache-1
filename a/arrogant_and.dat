5|$|Throughout {{his life}} in {{politics}} and his long military career he characterised the <b>arrogant</b> <b>and</b> extravagant aristocrat of the period. His progression through the Army was marked by many episodes of extraordinary incompetence, but this can be measured against his generosity to the men under his command and genuine bravery. As {{a member of the}} landed aristocracy he had actively and steadfastly opposed any political reform in Britain, but {{in the last year of}} his life he relented and came to acknowledge that such reform would bring benefit to all classes of society.|$|E
5|$|A vegetarian, Modi has a frugal {{lifestyle}} {{and is a}} workaholic and introvert. Adept at using social media, he has been since September 2014 the second-most-followed leader in the world (with over 34.6 million followers on Twitter as of September 2017), behind Barack Obama (95.6 million followers) and Donald Trump(38.8 million followers). Modi's 31 August 2012 post on Google Hangouts made him the first Indian politician to interact with netizens on live chat. Modi has also been called a fashion-icon for his signature crisply ironed, half-sleeved kurta, {{as well as for}} a suit with his name embroidered repeatedly in the pinstripes that he wore during a state visit by US President Barack Obama, which drew public and media attention and criticism. Modi's personality has been variously described by scholars and biographers as energetic, <b>arrogant,</b> <b>and</b> charismatic.|$|E

5|$|Although the British {{ships were}} {{substantially}} larger than any individual French vessel, the frigates were more numerous and more manoeuvrable. Neither side {{could afford to}} take significant damage in the battle, so each sought to drive the other off rather than achieve an outright victory. On 9 September Sercey's frigates formed a line of battle, successfully engaging first <b>Arrogant</b> <b>and</b> then Victorious and inflicting damage on each while preventing them from supporting one another. The French frigates, particularly Vertu and Seine, also suffered and by late morning both sides disengaged, the British retiring to Madras for repairs while Sercey anchored at King's Island in the Mergui Archipelago, eventually sheltering in Batavia.|$|E
5|$|Gary Lockwood, as Lt. Commander Gary Mitchell, had {{starred in}} the title role of Roddenberry's earlier series on NBC, The Lieutenant; Sally Kellerman was cast as Dr. Elizabeth Dehner. Both actors needed silver eyes, which were {{produced}} by an expert contact lens fabricator who sandwiched wrinkled tinfoil between two sclera contact lenses which covered the entire eye. These were outdated even in the 1960s and dangerous {{to the health of the}} actors' eyes. Although Kellerman could insert and remove the prosthetics easily with no discomfort, Lockwood found them almost impossible to use. He needed to raise his face and sight along his nose in order to see through tiny holes in the foil. He was able to use this to enhance his performance as the mutating Mitchell, the unusual gaze giving him an <b>arrogant</b> <b>and</b> haughty demeanor.|$|E

He is a stereotype of the successful man: money-minded, opinionated, <b>arrogant,</b> <b>and</b> a male chauvinist. In sharp contrast is Arun (Kamal Haasan), who has come to Chennai from Coimbatore to make a documentary on women. Sensitive and sincere, he believes his job has a purpose and is both shocked and amused at the cynical attitudes of Manju and Thyagu.|$|E

In Aliens: Colonial Marines, Hudson's corpse was discovered in the sewers with a large hole in his chest, revealing that Hudson was impregnated by a Facehugger after he was dragged beneath the grates and later died when a chestburster erupted from his chest.|$|E

5|$|The French squadron, {{commanded}} by Contre-amiral Pierre César Charles de Sercey, had left their base on Île de France in July, cruising off Ceylon and Tranquebar before sailing eastwards. Their movements {{had so far}} been unopposed as British forces in the East Indies were concentrated at Simon's Town {{in the west and}} Malacca in the east. After raiding the shipping at Banda Aceh on 1 September the squadron sailed eastwards to attack Penang. On 8 September, while the French were removing supplies from a captured British merchant ship east of Banda Aceh, two large sails were spotted.

5|$|William was famously {{biased against}} the Knights Templar, whom he {{believed}} to be <b>arrogant</b> <b>and</b> disrespectful of both secular and ecclesiastical hierarchies, as they {{were not required to}} pay tithes and were legally accountable only to the Pope. Although he was writing decades later, he is the earliest author to describe the actual foundation of the Templar order. He was generally favourable towards them when discussing their early days, but resented the power and influence they held in his own time. William accused them of hindering the Siege of Ascalon in 1153; of poorly defending a cave-fortress in 1165, for which twelve Templars were hanged by King Amalric; of sabotaging the invasion of Egypt in 1168; and of murdering Assassin ambassadors in 1173.|$|E
5|$|Jim O'Heir and Retta, {{who made}} regular {{appearances}} as parks employees Jerry Gergich and Donna Meagle {{in the first}} season, continued to appear in season two. Although still considered guest actors, their characters started to become more fully developed and play larger roles in the episodes. Several other actors played regular supporting roles throughout the second season. Jama Williamson continued her recurring role as Wendy, Tom Haverford's ex-wife who becomes a romantic interest for Ron Swanson. Mo Collins and Jay Jackson made repeated appearances as Pawnee journalists Joan Callamezzo and Perd Hapley. Both actors were originally expected to appear only in one episode, but both returned for subsequent episodes because the writing staff enjoyed their performances. Alison Becker played another Pawnee reporter, Shauna Malwae-Tweep, a character she also played in the first season. Ben Schwartz played Jean-Ralphio, an <b>arrogant</b> <b>and</b> fast-talking playboy friend of Tom, in several episodes. Pamela Reed reprised her recurring role as Leslie's mother, Marlene, in several second-season episodes.|$|E

5|$|Marseille {{tried to}} radio his {{position}} but {{was forced to}} bail out over the sea. He paddled around in the water for three hours before being rescued by a Heinkel He 59 float plane based at Schellingwoude. Severely worn out and suffering from exposure, {{he was sent to}} a field hospital. I.(Jagd)/LG 2 claimed three aerial victories for the loss of four Bf 109s that day. Marseille was in serious trouble when arriving back at the airfield. He had abandoned his leader Staffelkapitän Adolf Buhl, who was shot down and killed. He received a stern rebuke and final warning from Herbert Ihlefeld, during which he tore up his flight evaluations with a visibly upset Marseille looking on. Other pilots were voicing their dissent concerning Marseille. Because of his alienation of other pilots, his <b>arrogant</b> <b>and</b> unapologetic nature, Ihlefeld would eventually dismiss Marseille from LG 2.|$|E
5|$|Sun Tzu (pinyin: Sun Zi; c. 544 BC – 496 BC) was {{a native}} of the Qi state (now Huimin county in Shandong) during the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history, that was characterised by warring factions and a {{fragmented}} state. He {{came to the attention of}} King He Lu of Wu, who was impressed by his 13-chapter military treatise, The Art of War. In 512 BC, He Lu made Sun Tzu his Commander-in-Chief of the Wu army. For almost 20 years, the armies of Wu were victorious over their hereditary enemies, the kingdoms of Chu and Yue. In 496 BC, after He Lu died from his wounds in battle, his son, Fu Chai succeeded him. After numerous victories in battles, Fu Chai became <b>arrogant</b> <b>and</b> began to indulge in merrymaking. In time, the king started to disregard Sun Tzu's counsel and began to distance himself from Sun Tzu. Sensing this, Sun Tzu wisely gave up his position and left Wu for Qi in retirement. Fu Chai and his generals did not follow Sun Tzu's precepts and his kingdom was subsequently conquered by Chu in 473 BC. Out of shame, Fu Chai committed suicide after he had fled with the remnants of his defeated army.|$|E
5|$|Total British {{losses were}} four killed and 54 wounded. Captured in Table Bay were the Dutch East Indiaman Castor and the 14-gun naval brig Star, which was renamed HMS Hope. Elphinstone's {{substantial}} squadron remained on {{station at the}} Cape to deter efforts to recapture the colony. Parts of this force were subsequently deployed to bolster British forces in the Indian Ocean. The blockade of Île de France was restored and <b>Arrogant</b> <b>and</b> Victorious {{were sent to the}} Dutch East Indies where they would fight an inconclusive battle with a French squadron off Sumatra in September 1796. Elphinstone himself sailed for Madras, where he received reports that a Dutch force had sailed from the Netherlands to retake the Cape Colony. The Admiral returned to Cape Town, assembling a large squadron to await the Dutch arrival. Further reports revealed the strength and progress of the Dutch and Elphinstone had ample time to prepare his squadron for their arrival and increase the garrison ashore. The Dutch rear-admiral, Engelbertus Lucas, spent almost six months on the passage and gathered no intelligence on British defences. Thus when he arrived off the Cape he was soon discovered by Elphinstone in Saldanha Bay and intimidated into surrendering without a fight.|$|E
