40|$|Th e {{inventory}} of the leaf and <b>seed</b> <b>beetles</b> alien to Europe revealed a total of 25 species of which 14 <b>seed</b> <b>beetles</b> (bruchids) and 11 leaf beetles mostly belonging to the subfamilies Alticinae and Chrysomelinae. At present, aliens account for 9. 4 % of the total fauna of <b>seed</b> <b>beetles</b> in Europe whereas this percentage is less than 1 % for leaf <b>beetles.</b> Whilst <b>seed</b> <b>beetles</b> dominated the introductions in Europe until 1950, {{there has been an}} exponential increase in the rate of arrival of leaf beetles since then. New leaf beetles arrived at an average rate of 0. 6 species per year during the period 2000 – 2009. Most alien species originated from Asia but this pattern is mainly due to <b>seed</b> <b>beetles</b> of which a half are of Asian origin whereas leaf beetles pre-dominantly originated from North America (36. 4 %). Unlike other insect groups, a large number of alien species have colonized most of Europe. All but one species have been introduced accidentally with either the trade of beans or as contaminants of vegetal crops or stowaway. Most aliens presently concentrate in man-made habitats but little aff ect natural habitats (< 6 %). Highly negative economic impacts have been recorded on stored pulses of legumes and crops but very little is known about possible ecological impact...|$|R

In this contribution, the control effect {{by a combination of}} the parasitoid Anisopteromalus calandrae and the predator Xylocoris flavipes on both <b>seed</b> <b>beetle</b> species was evaluated in a laboratory study on black eyed beans Vigna unguiculata. The combination of parasitoid and predator was most effective against both species of <b>seed</b> <b>beetles.</b> However, in C. maculatus the combination was not significantly more effective compared to A. calandrae alone, suggesting a poor effect on adults and no effect on eggs and larvae by X. flavipes. In the case of A. obtectus, the suppressive effect by the combination of the parasitoid and the predator was high. For C. maculatus, germination of black eyed beans was a pproximately three times higher when both natural enemies were present. The combination of A. calandrae and X. flavipes is considered a promising component for integrated control of A. obtectus...|$|R

50|$|The bean weevils or <b>seed</b> <b>beetles</b> are a {{subfamily}} (Bruchinae) of beetles, now {{placed in}} the family Chrysomelidae, though they have historically been treated as a separate family.

50|$|Phenotypic {{plasticity}} {{can be seen}} in many organisms, {{one species}} that exemplifies this concept is the <b>seed</b> <b>beetle</b> Stator limbatus. This <b>seed</b> <b>beetle</b> reproduces on different host plants, two of the more common ones being Cercidium floridum and Acacia greggii. When C. floridum is the host plant, there is selection for a large egg size; when A. greggii is the host plant, there is a selection for a smaller egg size. In an experiment it was seen that when a beetle who usually laid eggs on A. greggii was put onto C. floridum, the survivorship of the laid eggs was lower compared to those eggs produced by a beetle that was conditioned and remained on the C. florium host plant. Ultimately these experiments showed the plasticity of egg size production in the beetle, as well as the influence of the maternal environment on the survivorship of the offspring.|$|R

40|$|During 1997 - 1998, field {{surveys were}} {{conducted}} to determine the incidence of <b>seed</b> <b>beetles</b> associated with field bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis L.) in Slovakia.

S. sericeus adults were recorded during the whole growing season (May-September), with maximum from May 20 to June 30. Only a few individuals were found during July and August. In September, the small blurred peak of occurrence was observed. S. sericeus lays its eggs externally on the pod. Egg laying started in the beginning of June. Freshly hatched larvae burrowed through the pod wall and entered the seed from mid June. Larvae remained within the seed for pupation.

50|$|Male {{genitalia}} evolve {{more rapidly}} and divergently in animals. Spiny genitalia can aid in male-male competition. In <b>seed</b> <b>beetles,</b> spiny genitalia help with anchor during copulation and allow a rapid {{passage to the}} female’s reproductive tract, thus overcoming female barriers to sperm. Females suffer costs {{as a result of}} injuries, but males do not benefit directly from harm inflicted on their mates. Damage, such as scarring, increases in the female tract with the number of matings. In <b>seed</b> <b>beetles,</b> a positive correlation exists between the degree of harmfulness of the male’s genitalia and the thickness or reinforcement of the wall of the bursa copulatrix in the female’s reproductive tract. As a result, females’ connective tissue in the copulatory tract increased in thickness. However, females with a thicker copulatory tract correlated positively to the amount of scarring, suggesting that scarring is a poor measure of costs for females. Females have evolved in other ways such as investing in immunocapacity to help with trauma associated during copulation.|$|R
40|$|Seeds of many arid habitat {{plants have}} a water-impermeable coat and can {{germinate}} only after being scarified. Bruchine <b>seed</b> <b>beetles</b> are important parasites of legume seeds in these environments, but {{their effect on}} germination can be unpredictable. <b>Beetles</b> deplete <b>seed</b> resources and can kill the embryo but also scarify seeds. We investigated {{the effects of a}} generalist parasite, Stator limbatus, on the germination and growth of two common legumes in the Sonoran desert, catclaw acacia (Acacia greggii) and blue paloverde (Parkinsonia florida). Feeding damage from a single larva greatly increased germination of paloverde but not acacia. This benefit was reduced if seeds were attacked by multiple larvae. Beetle-damaged seeds of both hosts germinated more quickly than did control <b>seeds.</b> Infestation by <b>beetles</b> reduced seedling size, though effects were greater for paloverde than for acacia. Our results demonstrate that the effect of S. limbatus can be highly host-specific. In addition, beetle infestation may enhance or reduce seedling recruitment, depending on the availability of other scarifying agents and the number of larvae per seed. Such contingencies make it difficult to predict the net effect of <b>seed</b> <b>beetles</b> on efforts to control invasive legume hosts or establish native hosts during aridland restoration...|$|R

The experiment was carried out at ambient temperature of 28 ± 3 C and relative humidity of 68 ± 3 % in the laboratory. Population suppression activities of Z. zanthoxyloides Root Bark Powder against <b>Seed</b> <b>Beetle</b> was recorded at 5, 7 and 10 g/ 150 g cowpea grains laid out in completely randomized design replicated four times including the untreated control. Plant products applied at rates greater than 20 % of the grain weight would not be economically viable in suppressing the population of insect pests. The root bark powder was applied to assess contact adult mortality, adult emergence, percentage weight loss and percentage grains damaged. Application rates of Z. zanthoxyloides were found to possess insecticidal activity against adult <b>seed</b> <b>beetle.</b> Topical application of the root bark powder caused significant (P< 0. 05) increase in adult mortality, reduced adult emergence, reduced weight loss of the grains and offered protection of cowpea grains against damage in small scale storage. Highest rate of treatment significantly increased adult mortality of C. maculatus compared to lower rates at 2 DAT. From the results, it could be concluded that the adults of C. maculatus were susceptible to Z. zanthoxyloides root bark powder. On the whole application of the plant material was better than no treatment at all. Such findings would be helpful in promoting research aimed at the development of new agents for C. maculatus control.
