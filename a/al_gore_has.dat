500|$|Civil disobedience as non-violent protest {{or civil}} {{resistance}} are also acts of conscience, but are designed {{by those who}} undertake them chiefly to change, by appealing to the majority and democratic processes, laws or government policies perceived to be incoherent with fundamental social virtues and principles (such as justice, equality or respect for intrinsic human dignity). Civil disobedience, in a properly functioning democracy, allows a minority who feel strongly that a law infringes their sense of justice (but have no capacity to obtain legislative amendments or {{a referendum on the}} issue) to make a potentially apathetic or uninformed majority take account of the intensity of opposing views. A notable example of civil resistance or satyagraha ("satya" [...] in sanskrit means [...] "truth and compassion", [...] "agraha" [...] means [...] "firmness of will") involved Mahatma Gandhi making salt in India when that act was prohibited by a British statute, in order to create moral pressure for law reform. Rosa Parks similarly acted on conscience in 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama refusing a legal order to give up her seat to make room for a white passenger; her action (and the similar earlier act of 15-year-old Claudette Colvin) leading to the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Rachel Corrie was a US citizen allegedly killed by a bulldozer operated by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) while involved in direct action (based on the non-violent principles of Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi) to prevent demolition of the home of local Palestinian pharmacist Samir Nasrallah. <b>Al</b> <b>Gore</b> <b>has</b> argued [...] "If you're a young person looking at the future of this planet and looking at what is being done right now, and not done, I believe we have reached the stage where it is time for civil disobedience to prevent the construction of new coal plants that do not have carbon capture and sequestration." [...] In 2011, NASA climate scientist James E. Hansen, environmental leader Phil Radford and Professor Bill McKibben were arrested for opposing a tar sands oil pipeline and Canadian renewable energy professor Mark Jaccard was arrested for opposing mountain-top coal mining; in his book Storms of my Grandchildren Hansen calls for similar civil resistance on a global scale to help replace the 'business-as-usual' Kyoto Protocol cap and trade system, with a progressive carbon tax at emission source on the oil, gas and coal industries â€“ revenue being paid as dividends to low carbon footprint families.|$|E

The paper begins with historical background on the development of older metropolitan areas. Why do they exist? How may changes in spatial structure that have occurred in the second half of the twentieth century be understood using the concept of "friction of distance"? We then examine impacts of the communication revolution on the spatial behavior of two important players in metropolitan areas: households and businesses. The paper concludes with some observations about two areas of concern: the increased spatial separation of haves and have-nots, and the greater isolation of people from one another. Both are possible consequences of the communication revolution...|$|E

Somewhat ironically, just when humans, with their {{increasing}} industry and development, seemed further and further from nature, having more power to manage it, just when humans were more and more rebuilding their environments with their super technologies, the natural world emerged as a focus of ethical concern. Environmental alarms started with prophets such Aldo Leopold, Rachel Carson, John Muir, and David Brower, and have, over recent decades, become daily news. A massive Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, sponsored by the United Nations, involving over 1, 300 experts from almost 100 nations, begins: "At the heart of this assessment is a stark warning. Human activity is putting such strain on the natural functions of Earth that the ability of the planet's ecosystems to sustain future generations can no longer be taken for granted " (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005 a, p. 5).

40|$|Maps {{have always}} been tools that have fascinated men, {{for their ability to}} make us see the world that {{surrounds}} us.

All these disciplines, which we now group under the new name of geomatics, have had a tremendous boost in recent years. However, the synergy with information computer technology is probably the aspect that is revolutionizing more cartography. Earlier computers and after the Internet have brought us to new concepts and tools that will have profound effects not only in the world of niche of cartographers, but also more generally in the life of all human beings. The Digital Earth, proposed in 1998 by <b>Al</b> <b>Gore,</b> <b>has</b> been enriched in just twenty years of a set of new demands, which make even more interesting and challenging being cartographers today.

Moreover, it urges the community of geomatics to be protagonist and promoter of a new cartography, largely to be reinvented, and that would put us at the center of processes of knowledge and management of the Earth.

Pharr, 706 / 542 - 5172, pharr@arches. uga. edu CONTACT: Prof. Ron Carlson, 706 / 542 - 5186 (O); (706) / 548 - 6771 (H) UGA LAW PROFESSOR URGES BUSH TEAM TO RETHINK STRATEGY ATHENS, Ga. - If Governor George Bush {{wants to}} win the {{mounting}} public relations war over the protracted presidential election, he should rethink his strategy and drop his appeal to the U. S. Supreme Court, says Professor Ron Carlson, a nationally renowned trial law expert at the University of Georgia School of Law. 2 Ì† 2 It 2 Ì† 7 s within the purview - {{the discretion of the}} Bush team - to decide between now and Friday to let the case go, 2 Ì† 2 says Carlson. 2 Ì† 2 If they dismiss the appeal, they will gain in terms of the public perception that they are finally cutting off this process. The cost to the Bush side is the appearance of doing what they 2 Ì† 7 re accusing Gore of doing - that is, extending the process with legalisms. 2 Ì† 2 Carlson says Bush has little to gain by having his attorneys argue before the Supreme Court on Friday, because the court may very well hear the arguments and determine the issue raised is moot. 2 Ì† 2 I think the most likely scenario is that the Supreme Court will find the issue to be moot because the appealing party has no damages to claim, 2 Ì† 2 says Carlson. 2 Ì† 2 Whatever adversity occurred to them {{as a result of the}} Florida Supreme Court decision has now been removed by this second certification. They did not lose in the end, at least in the view of the Florida officials that were responsible for the recount being reported. 2 Ì† 2 Carlson predicts that the spotlight will quickly shift from the U. S. Supreme Court - which has authorized an audio recording of Friday 2 Ì† 7 s oral arguments to be broadcast via radio on a tape delay, a move Carlson heralds as 2 Ì† 2 an extremely healthy and totally appropriate development 2 Ì† 2 - to the Florida trial courts, where Vice President <b>Al</b> <b>Gore</b> <b>has</b> announced he will contest election results in at least three counties. 2 Ì† 2 A contest is a trial in every sense of the word, 2 Ì† 2 says Carlson. 2 Ì† 2 I expect there will be opening statements, there will be direct and cross-examination of witnesses, there will be closing arguments, and then a decision by a judge. What we have here is an extended process at best. I expect these trials to be nationally televised, given the national interest in these issues, and I would expect it to be extended well beyond the deadline for certifying of electors. The public does not yet understand the lengthy process that a contest entails, but as the outlines become fully and starkly known, it will be a public relations disaster. 2 Ì† 2 Carlson, a nationally recognized expert in trial practice, has litigated many cases and has been admitted to practice before the United States Supreme Court. He has written numerous books on trial techniques and provided extensive commentary for the national media in high-profile trials.
