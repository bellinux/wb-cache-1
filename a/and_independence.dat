The definitions of <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> conditional <b>independence</b> in VBS generalize the corresponding def’mitions in probability theory. Our definitions apply not only to probability theory, but also to Dempster-Shafer’s belief-func-tion theory, Spohn’s epistemic-belief theory, and Zadeh’s possibility theory. In fact, they apply to any uncertainty calculi that fit {{in the framework of}} valuation-based systems. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a conceptual model of physical <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> dependence {{as it relates}} to adult onset, chronic physical illness <b>and</b> disability. Physical <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> dependence are presented as two separate, continuous, and multiply determined constructs, and illustrations are provided of situations where people can be independent, dependent, not independent, or experience imposed dependence. The paper also discusses potential determinants of physical <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> dependence, including different domains of disability, the role of subjective perceptions, demographics, the physical and social/political environments, personal resources, attitudes and coping resources, illness and efficacy appraisals, {{and the nature of the}} assistive relationship. The paper extends work on physical <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> dependence by synthesizing the findings from previous studies and incorporating the findings from other relevant areas of research into the area. It also expands on the concepts of physical <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> dependence, as well as their determinants, <b>and</b> relates <b>independence</b> <b>and</b> dependence to other outcomes of interest such as service delivery. physical independence dependence chronic illness disability...|$|R

Marriage, death, birth, the New Year <b>and</b> <b>Independence</b> Day are also communally celebrated. The practice of tromba (ritual spirit possession) is widespread among the Betsimisaraka.

Before the May agreement was announced, an April paramilitary attack in Liquiça left dozens of East Timorese dead. On 16 May 1999, a gang accompanied by Indonesian troops attacked suspected independence activists in the village of Atara; in June another group attacked a UNAMET office in Maliana.|$|E
5|$|As {{the period}} of Sovietization and Stalinism began, the PZPR was {{anything}} but united. The most important split among the communists occurred before the union with PPS, when the Stalinists forced Gomułka out of the PPR's top office and suppressed his native communist faction. The PZPR had become divided into several factions, which espoused different views and methods and sought different degrees of the Polish state's distinction <b>and</b> <b>independence</b> from the Soviet Union. While the official ideology, the Russian version of Marxism, was new to Poland, the communist regime continued, in many psychologically and practically important ways, the precepts, methods and manners of past Polish ruling circles, {{including those of the}} Sanation, the National Democracy, and the 19th century traditions of cooperation with the partitioning powers.|$|E
