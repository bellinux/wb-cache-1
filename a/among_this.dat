5|$|Among pterodactyloids {{a greater}} {{variation}} in diet is present. Pteranodontia contained many piscivorous taxa, such as ornithocheirans, boreopterids, pteranodontids and nyctosaurids. Some amount of niche partitioning {{seems to have}} been present: ornithocheirans and the later nyctosaurs were aerial dip-feeders like today's frigatebirds, while boreopterids were freshwater diving animals similar to cormorants or Platanista river dolphins, and pteranodonts were pelagic plunge-divers akin to boobies and gannets. The biggest exception <b>among</b> <b>this</b> group are the istiodactylids, which were likely primarily scavengers.|$|E

This local militia allied itself with the Union army forces at Jefferson Barracks under the leadership of Nathaniel Lyon, which on May 10, 1861 cleared a Confederate encampment outside the city in {{what became known as the}} Camp Jackson Affair. While the Confederates were being marched back into town, a group of citizens attacked the Union and militia forces, costing 28 civilian lives.|$|E

5|$|The black-throated gray warbler {{was first}} {{described}} by John Kirk Townsend from a specimen collected near today's Portland, Oregon. It {{was known to}} the Chinook inhabitants of the northwest coast, who called it Ah Kah a qual. Townsend described the species as Sylvia nigrescens, placing it with the other New World warblers and the unrelated Old World warblers in the genus Sylvia. It is now placed in the genus Setophaga along with about thirty other species, after having been classified in Dendroica for some time. Within its genus, {{it is part of}} a group with black throats and yellow face markings that includes the hermit warbler and Townsend's warbler. It is usually considered an early offshoot <b>among</b> <b>this</b> group of species, but genetic studies suggest a close relation to Grace's warbler.|$|E

5|$|With {{the peace}} of 1783, Harvey again took leave from the navy, seeing out his {{parliamentary}} term and continuing his notorious lifestyle of gambling and debauchery. The young death of Harvey's elder brother William Harvey, MP in April 1779 had provided Harvey with a substantial fortune, which he immediately began squandering in epic nights at London's fashionable drinking and gambling establishments. Harvey gained a reputation <b>among</b> <b>this</b> crowd for playing exceptionally high stakes; one often repeated story concerns his loss, on his 21st birthday in 1779, of over £100,000 in a single game of hazard to a Mr O'Byrne. O'Byrne, recognising that such a sum would bankrupt his opponent, refused to take more than £10,000, insisting that they roll the dice again to determine {{the fate of the}} remaining £90,000. Harvey won and kept his fortune, but reportedly still failed to pay the £10,000.|$|E
