40|$|This paper {{presents}} a combinatorial auction {{which is of}} particular interest when short completion times are of importance. It is based on a method for <b>approximating</b> the bidders' preferences over two types of items when complementarity between the two may exist. The resulting <b>approximated</b> preference relation is shown to be complete and transitive at any given price vector. It is shown that an <b>approximated</b> Walrasian equilibrium always exists if the <b>approximated</b> preferences of the bidders comply with the gross substitutes condition. This condition also ensures that the set of <b>approximated</b> equilibrium prices forms a complete lattice. A process is proposed which is shown to always reach the smallest <b>approximated</b> Walrasian price vector...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{econometrics}} of computed dynamic models. Since these models generally lack a closed-form solution, their policy functions are <b>approximated</b> by numerical methods. Hence, the researcher can only evaluate an <b>approximated</b> likelihood {{associated with the}} <b>approximated</b> policy function rather than the exact likelihood implied by the exact policy function. What are the consequences for inference {{of the use of}} <b>approximated</b> likelihoods? First, we find conditions under which, as the <b>approximated</b> policy function converges to the exact policy, the <b>approximated</b> likelihood also converges to the exact likelihood. Second, we show that second order approximation errors in the policy function, which almost always are ignored by researchers, have first order effects on the likelihood function. Third, we discuss convergence of Bayesian and classical estimates. Finally, we propose to use a likelihood ratio test as a diagnostic device for problems derived from the use of <b>approximated</b> likelihoods. Copyright The Econometric Society 2006. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an auction procedure {{which is of}} particular interest when short execution times are of importance. It is based on a method for <b>approximating</b> the bidders' preferences over two types of items when complementarity between the two may exist. In particular, linear approximations of the bidders' indifference curves are made. The resulting <b>approximated</b> preference relation is shown to be complete and transitive at any given price vector. It is shown that an <b>approximated</b> Walrasian equilibrium always exists if the <b>approximated</b> preferences of the bidders comply with the gross substitutes condition. Said condition also ensures that the set of <b>approximated</b> equilibrium prices forms a complete lattice.
