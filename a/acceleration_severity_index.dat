40|$|Head {{and brain}} {{injuries}} like concussion affect many hockey players throughout their playing careers. Hockey helmets {{remain to be}} the best form of head protection available as they function well to reduce the occurrence of skull fracture by minimizing linear accelerations and force transfer to the head. Currently, among helmet testing protocols and the literature, there is a large focus on peak linear acceleration reduction and the comparison of injury risk across impact conditions relative to linear accelerations felt by the brain. Additionally, gaps exist analyzing how certain impact characteristics like impact angle and neck stiffness influence injury risk. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the influence that impact angle, neck stiffness, and impact location have on commonly analyzed variables such as peak linear <b>acceleration</b> and <b>Severity</b> <b>Index,</b> while also analyzing differences in shear force and energy loaded onto the head and neck. The study served to create a model to compute the amount of energy loaded into the system composed of head, neck and helmet and to determine the strength of the relationship between the amounts of energy loaded into the system and the risk of injury estimated by <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> values. The study involved an analysis of 18 impacts at different velocities per helmet impact locations using a combination of three neck stiffness and two impact angles. In total, 540 impacts were conducted and analyzed. The findings were analyzed and an interaction effect with a medium effect size was observed between impact angle and impact location when measuring peak linear acceleration, F(8, 510) = 16. 174, p<. 005, ? 2 =. 113. Also, interaction effects with small effect sizes were determined between impact angle and impact location, F(4, 510) = 11. 977, p<. 005, ? 2 =. 086, as well as between neck torque and impact angle when measuring the amount of energy loaded onto the system, F(2, 510) = 3. 700, p=. 025, ? 2 =. 014. An interaction effect with a medium effect size was also observed between impact angle and impact location when measuring <b>Severity</b> <b>Index,</b> F(4, 510) = 12. 795, p< 0. 005, ? 2 =. 091. Finally, a three-way interaction with a small effect size was observed between the variables when measuring shear force applied to the headform, F(8, 510) = 5. 550, p<. 005, ? 2 =. 080. A model to predict energy loaded was also created using impact location, angle of impact, peak linear acceleration, and peak shear force as predictors, F(5, 535) = 54. 190, p<. 005. In addition to these findings, a moderate correlation between <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> and the amount of energy loaded onto the system was determined, r=. 340, p<. 05.

40|$|PurposeThis study {{compares the}} {{frequency}} and severity of head impacts sustained by football players on days with and without diagnosed concussion and to identify the sensitivity and specificity of single impact severity measures to diagnosed injury. Methods 1, 208 players from eight collegiate and six high school football teams wore instrumented helmets to measure head impacts during all team sessions, of which 95 players were diagnosed with concussion. Eight players sustained two injuries and one three, providing 105 injury cases. Measures of head kinematics (peak linear and rotational <b>acceleration,</b> Gadd <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> (GSI), Head Injury Criteria (HIC 15), change in head velocity (2 ̆ 01 dv)) {{and the number of}} head impacts sustained by individual players were compared between days with and without diagnosed concussion. Receiver operator characteristic curves were generated to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of each kinematic measure to diagnosed concussion using only those impacts that directly preceded diagnosis. ResultsPlayers sustained a higher frequency of impacts and impacts with more severe kinematic properties on days of diagnosed concussion than on days without diagnosed concussion. Forty-five injury cases were immediately diagnosed following head impact. For these cases, peak linear acceleration and HIC 15 were most sensitive to immediately diagnosed concussion (AUC = 0. 983). Peak rotational acceleration was less sensitive to diagnosed injury than all other kinematic measures (p = 0. 01) which are derived from linear acceleration (peak linear, HIC 15, GSI, and 2 ̆ 01 dv). ConclusionsPlayers sustain more impacts and impacts of higher severity on days of diagnosed concussion than on days without diagnosed concussion. Additionally, of historical measures of impact severity, those associated with peak linear acceleration are the best predictors of immediately diagnosed concussion. 5 R 49 CE 000196 /CE/NCIPC CDC HHS/United StatesP 20 GM 104937 /GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United StatesR 01 HD 048638 /HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United StatesR 01 NS 055020 /NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United StatesR 01 CE 001254 /CE/NCIPC CDC HHS/United StatesR 01 NS 055020 /NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United StatesR 44 HD 40473 /HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States 2014 - 04 - 01 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|R

The Head Injury Criterion (HIC), peak chest acceleration, peak chest deflection, and maximum femur force are each compared to the ASI, and flail space parameters. With respect to the vehicle crash test injury criteria, the occupant impact velocity and ASI are found to be conservative in the frontal collision mode.

The purposes of this study were to compare the <b>severity</b> <b>index</b> to invasive hemodynamics and Doppler echocardiography across the spectrum of calcific aortic valve disease, including aortic sclerosis and AS. 48 patients with aortic sclerosis and AS undergoing echocardiography and cardiac catheterization comprised the study population. The aortic valve leaflets were assessed for mobility (scale 1 to 6) and calcification (scale 1 to 4) and the <b>severity</b> <b>index</b> was calculated as the sum of the mobility and calcification scores according to the methods of Bahler et al. The <b>severity</b> <b>index</b> increased with increasing severity of aortic valve disease; the <b>severity</b> <b>indices</b> for patients with aortic sclerosis, mild to moderate AS and severe AS were 3. 38 ± 1. 06, 6. 45 ± 2. 16 and 8. 38 ± 1. 41, respectively.

The study was commissioned in response to doubts raised during the modelling of these bolts for a previous simulation carried out in 1995. Most of the simulations were carried out using a bus (TB 52). One simulation was carried out using a passenger car (TB 11). During the simulation using the passenger car, the barrier acted as a rigid construction, regardless of the road surface type involved. This raised the ASI value above the permitted safety value of the <b>Acceleration</b> <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> (ASI lower {{than or equal to}} 1. 4). During the simulation using the bus, the barrier was not breached, despite the fact that one or more bolts gave way. When the vertical freedom of movement of the anchor bolts was reduced, this clearly gave a less favourable result. The same thing occurred when the anchor units were fixed at intervals across the barrier element rather than being concentrated at one end. Therefore, the anchoring of an element should be concentrated in a single place.

OBJECTIVES: Using Nail Psoriasis <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> for evaluation in patients with plaque psoriasis during treatment with acitretin. METHODS: Thirty volunteers with plaque psoriasis were selected for the study. Twenty patients (8 women and 12 men) completed the study. The initial dose of acitretin was 0. 3 mg/kg/day for 30 days and was later raised to 0. 5 mg/kg/day. Nail Psoriasis <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> was collected in the first evaluation, after 2 and 4 months. Nails of both hands were evaluated. RESULTS: nail lesions were present in all patients at first evaluation. The initial Nail Psoriasis <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> median was 20 and the final score 20. 5 (2. 5 % of worsening {{at the end of the}} study). No statistically significant difference between the three evaluations was found (X 2 = 0. 8084, GL = 2, p = 0. 6657). Seven patients worsened in the final score. Three patients improved 50 % of the initial Nail Psoriasis <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> and only one had an improvement of 75 %. Linear correlation showed a weak association between the improvement percentage in PASI and Nail Psoriasis <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> (r = 0. 105, F = 2. 12, p = 0. 162).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Roadside safety {{barriers}} designs are tested with passenger cars in Europe using standard EN 1317 {{in which the}} impact angle for normal, high and very high containment level tests is 20 °. In comparison to EN 1317, the US standard MASH has higher impact angles for cars and pickups (25 °) and different vehicle masses. Studies in Europe (RISER) and the US have shown values for the 90 th percentile impact angle of 30 °– 34 °. Thus, the limited evidence available suggests that the 20 ° angle applied in EN 1317 may be too low. The first goal {{of this paper is}} to use the US NCHRP database (Project NCHRP 17 – 22) to assess the distribution of impact angle and collision speed in recent ROR accidents. Second, based on the findings of the statistical analysis and on analysis of impact angles and speeds in the literature, an LS-DYNA finite element analysis was carried out to evaluate the normal containment level of concrete barriers in non-standard collisions. The FE model was validated against a crash test of a portable concrete barrier carried out at the UK Transport Research Laboratory (TRL). The accident data analysis for run-off road accidents indicates that a substantial proportion of accidents have an impact angle in excess of 20 °. The baseline LS-DYNA model showed good comparison with experimental <b>acceleration</b> <b>severity</b> <b>index</b> (ASI) data and the parametric analysis indicates a very significant influence of impact angle on ASI. Accordingly, a review of European run-off road accidents and the configuration of EN 1317 should be performed...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{increase}} in the number of traffic accidents in tunnel emergency stop areas has been recored in the last two years in many countries with long road tunnels. In most cases, the collisions of passenger cars into the emergency stop area walls were fatal, which presents an even bigger obligation for the road management authorities to find a solution to the problem. Even though the tunnel emergency stop areas tunnels are designed and built according to the valid legislation, it has turned out that the current implementation of the emergency stop area wall in the driving direction presents a serious potential traffic safety risk. With the purpose of determining the most suitable method of protecting the SOS tunnel niche wall in the event of vehicle impacts, comparative numerical analysis of vehicle impacts has been performed in accordance with the SIS – EN 1317 standard. For the emergency-stop-area wall-impact protection, two different designs were considered: the H 2 safety railing and the crash cushion composed of eight cylindrical steel sheet tubes. The tube diameter is 500 mm and the sheet thickness is 3 mm. Both designs were subject to collision simulations in accordance with EN 1317 parts 1 and 2 (EN 1317 - 1 – - 4). As the safety of passenger cars was being studied, the tests TB 11 (vehicle mass 900 kg and vehicle velocity 100 km/h) and TB 21 (vehicle mass 1300 kg and vehicle velocity 80 km/h were simulated with a finite-element-model-based explicit dynamic analysis. The kinematic values of the vehicles just prior to the collision were determined by simulating the driving dynamics several seconds before the collision in PC-Crash. Based on the FEM analysis results in LS-Dyna for each crash scenario, a comparative analysis of the two protection systems was performed in order to determine their efficiency and suitability for installation in the existing tunnel emergency stop areas. Based on comparative analyses of the values of the <b>Acceleration</b> <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> (ASI), Theoretical Head Impact Velocity (THIV) and values of the Post-Impact Head Deceleration (PHD), the crash cushion provides the best results for the events of impacts of TB 11 vehicles and TB 21 vehicles into an SOS tunnel niche...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Equinus gait, {{defined as}} walking on one {{forefoot}} or both forefeet, {{has long been}} considered an undesirable characteristic in patients {{with a variety of}} neuromuscular disorders. In the equinus gait, the heel contact pattern is changed according to the severity, because an excessive ankle plantar flexion instigates rearfoot lifting in patients. However, no biomechanical <b>severity</b> <b>index</b> exists to evaluate the rehabilitation procedure of equinus gait. Therefore, we developed an SIEG (<b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> of Equinus Gait) for nondestructive evaluation of the equinus gait and to validate the index with regard to 11 kinematic and kinetic factors of gait analysis. In this study, the 3 -D heel contact pattern was considered {{for the development of a}} <b>severity</b> <b>index.</b> In order to verify the result, we compared the developed <b>severity</b> <b>index</b> values with ankle joint kinematic and kinetic factors in 3 test groups. As a result, the average SIEG values ranged between 10. 45 (Normal group) and 26. 61 (Severe group) and the highest correlation with regard to the 3 groups was shown in the developed <b>severity</b> <b>index.</b> Additionally, we also presented a fuzzy model using Takagi-Sugeno-Kang(TSK) logic with regard to the 12 factors in order to more accurately classify equinus gait...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: {{assessment}} {{instruments of}} nail psoriasis {{have been published}} in literature as means to standardize the previous subjective assessments of authors. OBJECTIVES: Using Nail Psoriasis <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> for evaluation in patients with plaque psoriasis during treatment with acitretin. METHODS: Thirty volunteers with plaque psoriasis were selected for the study. Twenty patients (8 women and 12 men) completed the study. The initial dose of acitretin was 0. 3 mg/kg/day for 30 days and was later raised to 0. 5 mg/kg/day. Nail Psoriasis <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> was collected in the first evaluation, after 2 and 4 months. Nails of both hands were evaluated. RESULTS: nail lesions were present in all patients at first evaluation. The initial Nail Psoriasis <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> median was 20 and the final score 20. 5 (2. 5 % of worsening {{at the end of the}} study). No statistically significant difference between the three evaluations was found (X 2 = 0. 8084, GL = 2, p = 0. 6657). Seven patients worsened in the final score. Three patients improved 50 % of the initial Nail Psoriasis <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> and only one had an improvement of 75 %. Linear correlation showed a weak association between the improvement percentage in PASI and Nail Psoriasis <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> (r = 0. 105, F = 2. 12, p = 0. 162). CONCLUSION: The method was easy and of rapid execution while potentially bringing information about changes in nail plate and matrix during treatment. The Nail Psoriasis <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> does not quantify the existing lesions and might not have the sensitivity to detect small changes...|$|R

40|$|Longitudinal safety {{barriers}} are tested {{in order to}} assess the {{safety barriers}} containment capacity and the vehicle occupant impact severity. In the EN standards, the occupant impact severity is evaluated with the same test (TB 11) for all the classes of barrier: a 900 kg car colliding with impact speed equal to 100 Km/h and impact angle equal to 20 °. Considering that real world impact conditions may be substantially different, at least two questions arise: 1. 	Which is the distribution of passenger cars kinetic impact energy for different type of roads and which is the relative position of the conventional test? 2. 	Are the values of <b>Acceleration</b> <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> (ASI), Theoretical Head Impact Velocity (THIV) and Post-impact Head Deceleration (PHD) obtained in the conventional test TB 11 representative for real world impact conditions? The “correct” answer to these questions requires a very expensive research program. This because a huge number of accident reports has to be collected and each accident event has to be reconstructed, furthermore many computer crash simulations have to be performed. In order to get a “preliminary” problem assessment, a study has been carried out performing an accident analysis and many crash simulation in different impacting conditions. The accident analysis has been carried out by the examination of 160 police run off the road accident reports on a rural dual carriageway road, integrated with the inspection of accident sites. Many accident parameters have been evaluated and distribution probabilities of impact velocity, impact angle and vehicle mass have been drawn. The real world impact conditions obtained have been used as input for the crash simulation of a passenger car against a longitudinal safety barrier. Impact simulations have been carried out by non-linear dynamic finite element analysis performed with the software LS-Dyna. The finite element model used for the vehicle is the result of an extensive modeling activity and is very capable to represent the crash dynamics and consequences. Collision outcomes in terms of THIV, PHD and ASI have been evaluated for each impact condition and, by combining the impact condition distributions with these results, the distributions of the impact severity indices have been assessed. The study carried out show that the probability of outcomes greater than the ones of the TB 11 are equal to 26 % for ASI, and 34 % for THIV and PHD. According to the results of the study, passenger cars crash test conditions more representative of real world impacts, on motorways and on rural dual carriageway roads, would be: - Impact speed = 130 km/h; - Impact angle = 20 degrees; - Vehicle mass = 1500 kg. Such impact conditions would represent the ninetieth percentile of cars kinetic transversal impact energy. Moreover, with reference to the rigid wall fixed to the ground used in the simulations, they give rise to ASI, THIV and PHD values more severe than eighty-five percent of real world run off the road accidents. The previous results show that the conditions proposed by the standard could be not conservative in Italy. They have to be intended, however, as preliminaries and stressing the need of a more in depth, and public funded, research program...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: We {{assessed}} {{the performance of}} 3 validated prognostic rules in predicting 30 -day mortality in community-acquired pneumonia: the 20 variable Pneumonia <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> and the easier to calculate CURB (confusion, urea nitrogen, respiratory rate, blood pressure) and CURB- 65 severity scores. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We prospectively followed 3181 patients with community-acquired pneumonia from 32 hospital emergency departments (January-December 2001) and assessed mortality 30 days after initial presentation. Patients were stratified into Pneumonia <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> risk classes (I-V) and CURB (0 - 4) and CURB- 65 (0 - 5) risk strata. We compared the discriminatory power (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) of these rules to predict mortality and their accuracy based on sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and likelihood ratios. RESULTS: The Pneumonia <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> (risk classes I-III) classified {{a greater proportion of}} patients as low risk (68 % [2152 / 3181]) than either a CURB score < 1 (51 % [1635 / 3181]) or a CURB- 65 score < 2 (61 % [1952 / 3181]). Low-risk patients identified based on the Pneumonia <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> had a slightly lower mortality (1. 4 % [31 / 2152]) than patients classified as low-risk based on the CURB (1. 7 % [28 / 1635]) or the CURB- 65 (1. 7 % [33 / 1952]). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was higher for the Pneumonia <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> (0. 81) than for either the CURB (0. 73) or CURB- 65 (0. 76) scores (P < 0. 001, for each pairwise comparison). At comparable cut-points, the Pneumonia <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> had a higher sensitivity and a somewhat higher negative predictive value for mortality than either CURB score. CONCLUSIONS: The more complex Pneumonia <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> has a higher discriminatory power for short-term mortality, defines a greater proportion of patients at low risk, and is slightly more accurate in identifying patients at low risk than either CURB score...|$|R
40|$|The {{possible}} {{role that}} tropical Pacific SSTs played in driving the megadroughts over North America during the medieval period is addressed. Fossil coral {{records from the}} Palmyra Atoll are used to derive tropical Pacific SSTs for the period from A. D. 1320 to A. D. 1462 and show overall colder conditions as well as extended multidecadal La Niña–like states. The reconstructed SSTs are used to force a 16 -member ensemble of atmosphere GCM simulations, each with different initial conditions, with the atmosphere coupled to a mixed layer ocean outside of the tropical Pacific. Model results are verified against North American tree ring reconstructions of the Palmer Drought <b>Severity</b> <b>Index.</b> A singular value decomposition analysis is performed using the soil moisture anomaly simulated by another 16 -member ensemble of simulations forced by global observed SSTs for 1856 – 2004 and tree ring reconstructions of the Palmer Drought <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> for the same period. This relationship is used to transfer the modeled medieval soil moisture anomaly (relative to the modern simulation) into a model-estimated Palmer Drought <b>Severity</b> <b>Index.</b> The model-estimated Palmer Drought <b>Severity</b> <b>Index</b> reproduces many aspects of both the interannual and decadal variations of the tree ring reconstructions, {{in addition to an}} overall drier climate that is drier than the tree ring records suggest.

30|$|This study {{investigated}} crash {{experience on the}} US- 191 corridor using four different crash indicators; crash frequency, <b>severity</b> <b>index,</b> combined safety index, and crash rate per mile distance. The crash frequency {{is the number of}} crashes occurring during the study period for all crash types or for a specific crash type such as the frequency of PDO, injury, or fatal crashes. The <b>severity</b> <b>index</b> takes into account the severity of crashes regardless of its frequency. To calculate the <b>severity</b> <b>index,</b> weights are to be applied to the different severity-type crashes. In this study, weights applied to the PDO, injury, and fatal crashes are 1, 5, and 15, respectively. The <b>severity</b> <b>index</b> is found by multiplying the frequency of each type of crash by its assigned weight, summing all values, and dividing the sum by the total frequency of crashes. The combined safety index takes both frequency and severity into consideration in describing crash experience. Again, this index utilizes different weights for each type of crash, i.e., PDO, injury, and fatal crashes. The weights used in this study are the same as those used for the <b>severity</b> <b>index</b> discussed earlier. To calculate the combined safety index, frequency of the PDO, injury, and fatal crashes are multiplied by their assigned weights and summed together into a single index value. Finally, crash rate by distance (in miles) was also utilized in the analyses involved in this study.|$|R
