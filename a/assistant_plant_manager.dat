40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to define a simple (and easy to use) method to {{equalize}} the workload of personnel operating several small wastewater treatment plants (SWWTPs). The approach is illustrated through a case study which is the result of collaboration between researchers and a water and wastewater management company operating in Southern Italy. The topic is important since personnel {{have a significant impact on}} the operating costs of SWWTPs, and the approach outlined results in the minimum number of staff being required to assure the management of the service. Four kinds of work units are considered: <b>plant</b> <b>managers,</b> <b>assistant</b> <b>plant</b> <b>managers,</b> laboratory technicians and executives. In order to develop a practical, feasible and easy to use method, the workload was evaluated considering only the population equivalent (PE) and the number of plants managed. The core of the method is the evaluation of the percentage of time that the personnel units devote to the operation of SWWTPs of the municipality considered. The proposed procedure offers a useful tool to equalize the workload, both in terms of PE and the number of plants managed, the procedure being easily modifiable to introduce other evaluation criteria. By using familiar concepts such as PE and number of plants managed, the approach of the method can easily be understood by management. It can also be readily adapted to other similar situations...|$|R

40|$|<b>Plant</b> <b>managers</b> {{generally}} have no direct marketing responsibilities {{but they have}} control over product quality and customer service. This paper hypothesises that many firms evaluate these managers on profit because sales, a component of profit, convey information on a <b>plant</b> <b>manager's</b> performance on product quality and customer service. Several predictions are developed from the hypothesis and tested in this study. The chance that a <b>plant</b> <b>manager</b> is evaluated on cost vs profit is predicted to decrease with the sensitivity and precision of sales {{as an indicator of}} product quality and customer service. In addition, the chance that a <b>plant</b> <b>manager</b> is evaluated on cost vs profit may be associated with {{the extent to which the}} manager is also evaluated on specific measures of product quality and customer service. Empirical results are generally consistent with these predictions. compensation; cost centres; performance evaluation; plant managers; profit centres; product quality; customer service. ...|$|R

Using a new data set of American and European manufacturing firms, we find indeed that better information technologies (enterprise resource planning (ERP) for <b>plant</b> <b>managers</b> and computer-assisted design/computer-assisted manufacturing for production workers) are associated with more autonomy and a wider span of control, whereas technologies that improve communication (like data intranets) decrease autonomy for workers and <b>plant</b> <b>managers.</b> Using instrumental variables (distance from ERP’s place of origin and heterogeneous telecommunication costs arising from regulation) strengthens our results...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} little {{systematic}} study of what <b>plant</b> <b>managers</b> actually do {{on a day-to-day basis}} that accounts for their success in achieving organizational outcomes. In our field interviews and observations of high-reputation <b>plant</b> <b>managers</b> from 11 manufacturing plants, we found that effective political skill enabled them to influence subordinates in ways that contributed positively to organizational outcomes. Political skill is an interpersonal style that combines social astuteness with the ability to relate well, and otherwise demonstrate situationally appropriate behavior in an engaging way that inspires confidence, trust, and genuiness [Ferris, G. R., Perrewé, P. L., Anthony, W. P., Gilmore, D. C., 2000. Political skill at work. Organizational Dynamics 28 (4), 25 – 37]. We observed that effective <b>plant</b> <b>managers</b> possessed a configuration of dispositional traits (self-motivation, sense of humility, and affability), systematically employed interpersonal behaviors (creating accountability, leading by example, and developing trust), and focused on managerial processes (stretch goals, influencing and learning from below, and empowering direct reports). By juxtaposing the political skill and power literatures, we propose a theory of <b>plant</b> <b>manager</b> effectiveness as a combination of political skill and the use of unobtrusive and systemic power to achieve both affective and substantive outcomes...|$|R
