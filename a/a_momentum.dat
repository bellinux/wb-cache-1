5|$|In 1989, Mani {{opted to}} make his next project Geethanjali, his maiden venture in Telugu. Starring Nagarjuna in the lead role, the film {{told the story of}} an ill-fated couple, both of whom are {{suffering}} from terminal diseases. Geethanjali was critically acclaimed and won the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment in 1990. In addition, it won the Best Director and Nandi Award for Best Story Writer for Mani. Mani maintained <b>a</b> <b>momentum</b> of making emotional stories of under-served people through the film Anjali in 1990, which starred Raghuvaran and told the story of an autistic child who changed the lives of people around her. The film proved to be a commercial success and was nominated as India's official entry to the Oscars in the Best Foreign Language Film category at the 63rd Academy Awards. Following Anjali's release, Mani later made another underworld-themed Tamil film, Thalapathi (1991), starring Rajinikanth and Mammootty. The film was an adaptation of Mahabharata, dealt with the friendship between Karna and Duryodhana portrayed by Rajinikanth and Mammmooty respectively. The film met with both critical acclaim and commercial success upon release. Ilaiyaraaja's musical score and Mani's work were highly appreciated as they both {{went on to win the}} Music Director and Best Director awards respectively at the 39th Filmfare Awards.|$|E

25|$|In {{cases where}} the {{diameter}} of a trapped particle is significantly greater than the wavelength of light, the trapping phenomenon can be explained using ray optics. As shown in the figure, individual rays of light emitted from the laser will be refracted as it enters and exits the dielectric bead. As a result, the ray will exit in a direction different from which it originated. Since light has <b>a</b> <b>momentum</b> associated with it, this change in direction indicates that its momentum has changed. Due to Newton's third law, {{there should be an}} equal and opposite momentum change on the particle.|$|E

25|$|In the {{mathematical}} formulation of quantum mechanics, pure quantum states correspond to vectors in a Hilbert space, while each observable quantity (such as the energy or momentum of a particle) {{is associated with}} a mathematical operator. The operator serves as a linear function which acts on the states of the system. The eigenvalues of the operator correspond to the possible values of the observable, i.e. it is possible to observe a particle with <b>a</b> <b>momentum</b> of 1kgm/s if and only if one of the eigenvalues of the momentum operator is 1kgm/s. The corresponding eigenvector (which physicists call an eigenstate) with eigenvalue 1kgm/s would be a quantum state with a definite, well-defined value of momentum of 1kgm/s, with no quantum uncertainty. If its momentum were measured, the result is guaranteed to be 1kgm/s.|$|E

When asked if Vang Pao was crucial to Momentum's continuance, Lair answered that {{there were a number of}} Hmong officers who could rise to command if Vang Pao became a casualty.

25|$|On {{behalf of}} the pretender Demetre, Liparit enjoyed a series of successes against Bagrat. In spite of Demetre’s death in 1042, Liparit {{continued}} his struggle in alliance with the Byzantines and David I of Lorri. After the defeat at Sasireti, Bagrat was left with the western provinces only. During the Seljuk campaigns in Anatolia in 1048, Liparit, who had been fighting on the Byzantine side, was captured at the Battle of Kapetrou. Bagrat took advantage of this, {{and returned to his}} eastern possessions. The king’s fortunes were quickly reversed, however, upon Liparit’s return from captivity. The rebellious duke forced Bagrat to flee to Constantinople where he was kept, as a result of Liparit’s intrigues, for three years. In the absence of Bagrat (1050–1053), Liparit was an effective ruler of Georgia; he even installed Bagrat’s son George as king and declared himself a regent. After Bagrat’s return, Liparit again warred against him. Eventually in 1060 his followers conspired and surrendered the duke to King Bagrat, who forced him into a monastery. Now, Bagrat gained <b>a</b> <b>momentum</b> to restrict the power of dynastic princes, reduced the kings of Lorri and Kakheti to impotence, and briefly held Tbilisi.|$|E
