40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the leading cause of cancer death in women and affects {{hundreds}} of thousands of women and their families yearly in the United States. Having <b>a</b> family <b>history</b> <b>of</b> breast cancer is one of the strongest predictors of developing the disease. Previous studies have found evidence that women with <b>a</b> family <b>history</b> <b>of</b> breast cancer have excessive worry and intrusive thoughts about developing the disease and may react differently to stress than women who do not have <b>a</b> family <b>history</b> <b>of</b> breast cancer. This study uses the novel approach of measuring the activity of the autonomic nervous system to compare stress reactivity between women with and without <b>a</b> family <b>history</b> <b>of</b> breast cancer. Eighty-two women with <b>a</b> family <b>history</b> <b>of</b> breast cancer and 140 women without <b>a</b> family <b>history</b> <b>of</b> breast cancer who were otherwise healthy underwent a laboratory stress test. During the test, their heart rate variability was measured as a proxy for the activity of the autonomic nervous system. Repeated measures of heart rate variability were taken at baseline, the three tasks of the stress test, and during a recovery period. The reactivity of the two groups throughout the test were compared using a mixed effects ANCOVA model. One of nine heart rate variability measures showed significant group differences. During the stress test, women with <b>a</b> family <b>history</b> <b>of</b> breast cancer had significantly higher levels of parasympathetic activity than women without <b>a</b> family <b>history</b> <b>of</b> breast cancer. Public Health Significance: The results of this study can be used to further our understanding of the effects <b>of</b> having <b>a</b> family <b>history</b> <b>of</b> breast cancer...|$|R
