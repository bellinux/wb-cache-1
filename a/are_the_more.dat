5|$|The {{waters of}} {{south-west}} Wales of Gower, Pembrokeshire and Cardigan Bay attract marine animals, including basking sharks, Atlantic grey seals, leatherback turtles, dolphins, porpoises, jellyfish, crabs and lobsters. Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion {{in particular are}} recognised as an area of international importance for bottlenose dolphins, and New Quay has the only summer residence of bottlenose dolphins {{in the whole of}} the UK. River fish of note include char, eel, salmon, shad, sparling and Arctic char, whilst the Gwyniad is unique to Wales, found only in Bala Lake. Wales is also known for its shellfish, including cockles, limpet, mussels and periwinkles. Herring, mackerel and hake <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> common of the country's seafish.|$|E
5|$|Bill C-213 or Louis Riel Day Act and Bill C-417 Louis Riel Act <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> notable acts {{which have}} gone through parliament. Bill C-297 to revoke the {{conviction}} of Louis Riel {{was introduced to the}} House of Commons 21 October and 22 November 1996, however the motion lacked unanimous consent from the House and was dropped. Bill C-213 or the Louis Riel Day Act of 1997 attempted to revoke the conviction of Louis Riel for high treason and establish a National Day in his honour on 16 November. Bill C-417 or the Louis Riel Act which also had a first reading in parliament to revoke the conviction of Louis Riel, and establish 15 July as Louis Riel Day was tabled.|$|E
5|$|Every {{game in the}} SmackDown vs. Raw series used to {{have the}} amount of damage inflicted to the player's chosen superstar, {{measured}} with a meter on the HUD, where a design of a male figure presented the damage. As a move was performed against a superstar, the affected area of the body flashed—the more damage that is done to that specific body part, {{the more likely it}} is for the superstar to submit. Colors were used to represent the amount of damage done to a specific body area; yellow represented minimal damage, orange represented moderate damage, and red represented maximum damage. This was however taken out of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010. Now the only way to tell how damaged the opponent is to watch their physical body actions that indicate how hurt they <b>are.</b> <b>The</b> <b>more</b> damage inflicted to opponents, {{the more likely it is}} for them to lose the match. There are four ways to win a match in every game: by pinfall, submission, knockout, countout; alternatively, the match could end in a draw. With the introduction of an on-screen referee in WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It, the ability to win by disqualification was also included.|$|E

50|$|An {{overarching}} {{definition of}} intelligence can <b>be</b> as follows: <b>The</b> <b>more</b> mentally efficient (that <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> faster and <b>more</b> focused on goal), capable (that <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> information one can hold in mind {{at a given}} moment), foresighted (that <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> clearly one can specify his goals and plan how to achieve them), and flexible (that <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> one can introduce variations in the concepts and mental operations one already possesses) a person <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> intelligent (both in regard to other individuals and in regard to a general developmental hierarchy) this person is.|$|R

5|$|The {{beliefs of}} the general public about the effect of {{extraterrestrial}} contact have also been studied. A poll of United States and Chinese university students in 2000 provides factor analysis of responses to questions about, , the participants' belief that extraterrestrial life exists in the Universe, that such life may be intelligent, and that humans will eventually make contact with it. The study shows significant weighted correlations between participants' belief that extraterrestrial contact may either conflict with or enrich their personal religious beliefs and how conservative such religious beliefs <b>are.</b> <b>The</b> <b>more</b> conservative the respondents, the more harmful they considered extraterrestrial contact to be. Other significant correlation patterns indicate that participants took the view that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence may be futile or even harmful.|$|E
5|$|The nesting and {{breeding}} biology of antbirds {{have not been}} well studied. Even in relatively well-known species the breeding behaviour can be poorly known; for example the nest of the ocellated antbird was first described in 2004. Nests are constructed by both parents, although the male undertakes more {{of the work in}} some species. Antbird nests are cups of vegetation such as twigs, dead leaves and plant fibre, and they follow two basic patterns: either suspended or supported. Suspended cups, which may hang from forks in branches, or between two branches, <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> common style of nest. Supported nests rest upon branches, amongst vines, in hollows, and sometimes on mounds of vegetation on the ground. Each species nests at the level where it forages, so a midstory species would build its nest in the midstory. Closely related species nest in the same ways. For example, antvireos in the genus Dysithamnus are all suspension nesters.|$|E
5|$|The {{park has}} 56 {{recorded}} mammal species. Grizzly and black bear inhabit the forested regions. Cougar, Canada lynx, wolverine, red fox, weasel, river otter, coyote, and timber wolf {{are the primary}} predatory mammals. Elk, mule deer, and white-tailed deer are common in the valleys of the park, including around (and sometimes in) the Banff townsite, while moose {{tend to be more}} elusive, sticking primarily to wetland areas and near streams. In the alpine regions, mountain goat, bighorn sheep, marmot and pika are widespread. Other mammals such as beaver, porcupine, squirrel, chipmunk, snowshoe hare, and Columbian ground squirrel <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> commonly observed smaller mammals. Caribou were the rarest large mammals in the park, but an avalanche in 2009 may have killed the last five remaining within park boundaries.|$|E
5000|$|The Helcionellacea {{includes}} two families {{according to the}} Treatise,1960, <b>the</b> Helcionellidae, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> primitive, and <b>the</b> Coreospiridae, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> derived.|$|R

30|$|<b>The</b> rich-get-richer {{mechanism}} <b>is</b> {{known to}} describe well how scientific publications (Wang et al. 2013) and innovations (Bass 1999; 2004) acquire attention. In {{the context of}} scientific publications, the reason behind preferential attachment <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> <b>more</b> a scientific publication <b>is</b> known, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> likely it <b>is</b> to <b>be</b> cited, and <b>the</b> <b>more</b> cited it <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> well known it is.|$|R

The Southern Live Oak is perhaps the most emblematic of the city.|$|E

25|$|Excellent {{sandy beaches}} {{are found in}} many locations. Western beaches, such as those around El Cotillo, can {{experience}} strong surf. The beaches adjoining the extensive sand dunes east of Corralejo are popular, as <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> protected extensive sandy shores of the Playa de Sotavento de Jandia on the southeastern coast between Costa Calma and the Morro Jable. Naked sun bathing and swimming are the norm almost on all beaches.|$|E
25|$|Image {{rejection}} is {{an important}} factor in choosing the intermediate frequency of a receiver. The farther apart the bandpass frequency and the image frequency <b>are,</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> the bandpass filter will attenuate any interfering image signal. Since the frequency separation between the bandpass and the image frequency is , a higher intermediate frequency improves image rejection. It may be possible to use a high enough first IF that a fixed-tuned RF stage can reject any image signals.|$|E
25|$|The {{reactions}} {{are due to}} collisions of reactant species. The frequency with which the molecules or ions collide depends upon their concentrations. The more crowded the molecules <b>are,</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> {{likely they are to}} collide and react with one another. Thus, an increase in the concentrations of the reactants will usually result in the corresponding increase in the reaction rate, while a decrease in the concentrations will usually have a reverse effect. For example, combustion will occur more rapidly in pure oxygen than in air (21% oxygen).|$|E
