50|$|Often {{when two}} {{companies}} deal {{with each other}} in the course of business, they will use standard form contracts. Often these standard forms contain terms which conflict (e.g. both parties include a liability waiver in their form). The 'battle of the forms' refers to the resulting legal dispute arising where both parties accept that a legally binding contract exists, but disagree about whose standard terms apply. Such disputes may be resolved by reference to the 'last document rule', i.e. whichever business sent the last document, or 'fired the last shot' (often the seller's <b>delivery</b> <b>note)</b> is held to have issued the final offer and the buyer's organisation is held to have accepted the offer by signing the <b>delivery</b> <b>note</b> or simply accepting and using the delivered goods.|$|R

5000|$|The First Amendment of the United States Constitution declares, “Congress {{shall make}} no law {{respecting}} an establishment of religion, or prohibiting {{the free exercise}} thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or {{the right of the}} people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances." [...] It is easy to mistakenly interpret the First Amendment as granting people the right to say whatever they want, whenever, and wherever they want. However, the United States Supreme Court has interpreted that the First Amendment was never intended to provide such power, because it does not protect speech at all times and in all places. The Court has consistently ruled that the government has the power to impose limits on free speech in regards to its time, place, and manner of <b>delivery.</b> <b>As</b> <b>noted</b> in Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence (1984), “... place, and manner restrictions… are valid provided that they are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, that they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and that they leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.” These restrictions are proved constitutional time and time again, in many Supreme Court cases. It is important to understand the limits to the protection of freedom of speech by learning about time, place, and manner restrictions.|$|R

These notes constitute {{a large part of}} the medical record. Medical students often develop their clinical reasoning skills by writing admission notes. The traditional, rational definition of being admitted usually involves spending an overnight in the hospital. This definition is sometimes stretched in the U.S. medical billing industry, where hospital corporations may blur the definitions of [...] "admission" [...] and [...] "observation" [...] because of reimbursement rules under which healthcare payors pay less for the care if an [...] "admission" [...] was involved.|$|R
