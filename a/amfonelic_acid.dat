40|$|The Spontaneously Diabetic Wistar B. B. Rat (SDR) is {{considered}} to be a genetically determined animal model of human Type- 1 diabetes. The overall objective of this thesis was to elucidate the behavioral and neurochemical profile of the SDR. This objective was attained using various pharmacological, behavioral and neurochemical approaches. The course of the changes was followed sequentially, at discretely defined time frames (0 - 2, 2 - 8 and 8 - 12 months duration of diabetes), to explore and characterize the contended dysfunctions. Overall, it was found that the insulin treated SDR exhibited a significantly attenuated locomotor and rearing response to the systemically administered dopamine agonists d-amphetamine and <b>amfonelic</b> <b>acid.</b> In the case of d-amphetamine, it was found that the attenuated response was robust and chronic as it persisted across all three time frames. The attenuated response of the insulin treated SDR to <b>amfonelic</b> <b>acid</b> demonstrated that the behavioral deficit could also be elicited by a dopamine agonist with a different mechanism of action from d-amphetamine. In a nonpharmacological experiment, it was found that the insulin treated SDR manifested a significantly attenuated nocturnal locomotor and rearing response, particularly to transitional photoperiodic cues. This deficit in responding was chronic and robust as it was observed across all three time frames. The possible neurochemical substrates of the aforementioned effects were investigated. A post-mortem neurochemical analysis of the region specific basal levels of CNS catecholamines and metabolites, in the insulin maintained and deprived SDR, was undertaken. There were no significant differences between the insulin maintained SDR and non-diabetic littermates or genetically distinct controls. The cessation of insulin administration to the SDR for four consecutive days resulted in significant increases in the levels of norepinephrine in the cortex and hypothalamus, dopamine in the hippocampus, and homovanillic acid in the striatum. The neurochemical response of the insulin treated SDR was assessed following a pharmacological challenge. The SDR was exposed to a single dose of (1. 0 mg/kg, i. p.) <b>amfonelic</b> <b>acid.</b> The SDR exhibited a significantly greater reduction in the post-mortem levels of dopamine in the striatum, midbrain, and olfactory bulbs as well as striatal norepinephrine. The behavioral effects elicited by d-amphetamine and <b>amfonelic</b> <b>acid</b> are believed to be dopamine mediated. Thus, it was hypothesized that one source of the observed neurochemical and behavioral deficits may be related to an impairment of dopaminergic neurotransmission. Therefore, the concomitant measurement of spontaneous nocturnal locomotor activity and levels of interstitial dopamine from the ventral striatum was measured using in vivo microdialysis. No significant differences between the insulin treated SDR and controls were found. The SDR did exhibit significantly lower levels of locomotor activity. In a different vein, the behavioral response of the insulin treated SDR was assessed following exposure to environments varying in degree of novelty. It was found that the SDR exhibited a heightened behavioral response to novelty-stress. The insulin maintained SDR manifested a greater aversion to the anxiogenic regions of the open field and elevated plus maze whilst being treated with chlordiazepoxide. The anxiolytic effects of this drug were significantly attenuated in the SDR when compared to controls. In essence, it would appear that the SDR when treated with insulin and unchallenged by: (1) withdrawal of insulin treatment, (2) pharmacological stimulation or, (3) environmental stimulation, is able to maintain relatively stable baseline levels of brain catecholamines and behavior.

40|$|Evaluated the {{interaction}} of either gaboxadol HCl (THIP) or muscimol, both gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A agonists, with indirect-acting dopamine agonists (DAGs) methylphenidate, (+) -amphetamine, metamphetamine, <b>amfonelic</b> <b>acid,</b> indatraline, nomifensine, diclofensine, mazindol, and GBR 12935 and with direct-acting DAGs WIN 35, 428, bupropion, GBR 12909, and cocaine. 1, 832 male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were given either with saline or 1 of the doses of THIP or muscimol before an injection of a dopamine agonist. Gnawing on corrugated packing paper was measured. Results showed that: (1) indirect- but not direct-acting DAGs induced gnawing, (2) gnawing induced by indirect-acting DAGs GBR 12935, nomifensine and mazindol was potentiated in mice in which GABA type A receptors were stimulated either by THIP or muscimol, and (3) indirect DAGs had a differential sensitivity {{to the effects of}} THIP and muscimol.

40|$|Compared {{the ability}} of {{indirect}} dopamine (DA) agonists to induce gnawing behavior (GB) in male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice with that of direct DA agonists acting at DA D-sub- 1 or D-sub- 2 receptor subtypes. Eight Ss were used per dose. Holes left by Ss on corrugations of packing cardboard were used as an objective index of GB. Indirect DA agonists, including DA releasers such as fencamfamine and <b>amfonelic</b> <b>acid</b> and DA uptake inhibitors such as cocaine and nomifensine, produced dose-dependent increases in GB. None of the direct agonists (e. g., apomorphine, quinpirole) increased GB. The dopaminergic nature of GB was confirmed in studies in which a host of compounds (e. g., nicotine, caffeine, dizocilpine) with primary actions at nondopaminergic sites did not induce GB.

40|$|Background: Few {{systematic}} studies {{exist on}} the effects of chronic reuptake of monoamine neurotransmitter systems during pregnancy on the regulation of maternal behavior (MB), although many drugs act primarily through {{one or more of these}} systems. Previous studies examining fluoxetine and <b>amfonelic</b> <b>acid</b> treatment during gestation on subsequent MB in rodents indicated significant alterations in postpartum maternal care, aggression, and oxytocin levels. In this study, we extended our studies to include chronic gestational treatment with desipramine or amitriptyline to examine differential effects of reuptake inhibition of norepinephrine and combined noradrenergic and serotonergic systems on MB, aggression, and oxytocin system changes. Methods: Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were treated throughout gestation with saline or one of three doses of either desipramine, which has a high affinity for the norepinephrine monoamine transporter, or amitriptyline, an agent with high affinity for both the norepinephrine and serotonin monoamine transporters. MB and postpartum aggression were assessed on postpartum days 1 and 6 respectively. Oxytocin levels were measured in relevant brain regions on postpartum day 7. Predictions were that amitriptyline would decrease MB and increase aggression relative to desipramine, particularly at higher doses. Amygdaloidal oxytocin was expected to decrease with increased aggression. Results: Amitriptyline and desipramine differentially reduced MB, and at higher doses reduced aggressive behavior. Hippocampal oxytocin levels were lower after treatment with either drug but were not correlated with specific behavioral effects. These results, in combination with previous findings following gestational treatment with other selective neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitors, highlight the diverse effects of multiple monoamine systems thought to be involved in maternal care...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{pharmacological}} manipulations of dopaminergic transmission on appetitive and consummatory aspects of male sexual behavior were investigated in castrated male Japanese quail treated with exogenous testosterone. Appetitive male sexual behavior {{was assessed by}} measuring a learned social proximity response and consummatory behavior was assessed by measuring copulatory behavior per se. The nonselective dopamine receptor agonist, apomorphine, inhibited in a dose-dependent manner both components of male sexual behavior. Two indirect dopamine agonists were also tested. Nomifensine, a dopamine re-uptake inhibitor, decreased appetitive sexual behavior but increased the frequency of mount attempts, a measure of consummatory sexual behavior. <b>Amfonelic</b> <b>acid,</b> a compound that enhances dopaminergic tone by a complex mechanism, increased aspects of both appetitive and consummatory behaviors. These data suggest that, in quail, as in rodents, increases in dopaminergic tone facilitate both appetitive and consummatory aspects of male sexual behavior. Apomorphine may be inhibitory in quail because it acts primarily on D 2 -like receptors, unlike in rats, where it stimulates sexual behavior and acts primarily on D 1 -like receptors at low doses but interacts with D 2 -like receptors at higher doses. This {{is supported by the}} observation that stereotyped pecking, a behavior stimulated selectively in quail by D 2 agonists, was increased by apomorphine but not by the two indirect agonists. The observed partial dissociation between the effects of these dopaminergic agonists on appetitive and consummatory sexual behaviors suggests that these two components of male sexual behavior may be controlled by the action of dopamine through different neuronal systems.

40|$|In the quail preoptic area (POA) {{anatomical}} and {{pharmacological data}} suggest that catecholamines may be implicated in the control of testosterone (T) aromatization into estrogens. The biochemical mechanism(s) mediating this control of the enzyme activity is (are) however unexplored. The present {{studies were carried out}} to investigate whether the catecholamines, dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) are able to directly affect aromatase activity (AA) measured during in vitro incubations of POA homogenates. AA was quantified in the POA-hypothalamus of adult male Japanese quail by measuring the tritiated water production from [1 beta- 3 H]-androstenedione. Enzyme activity was linear {{as a function of the}} incubation time and of the protein content of homogenates. It exhibited a typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with an apparent Km of 2. 8 nM and a Vmax of 266. 6 fmol h(- 1) mg wet weight(- 1). AA was then measured at a substrate concentration of 25 nM in the presence of catecholamines and some of their receptor agonists or antagonists, at two concentrations, 10 (- 3) and 10 (- 6) M. Norepinephrine and prazosin (alpha 1 -adrenergic antagonist) had no or very limited effects on AA at both concentrations. In contrast, DA and some D 1 and/or D 2 receptor agonists (apomorphine[D 1 /D 2], SKF- 38393 [D 1] and RU- 24213 [D 2]) depressed AA by 40 to 70 % at the 10 (- 3) M concentration. One D 2 receptor antagonist also produced a major inhibition of AA (sulpiride) while other antagonists either had no significant effect or only produced moderate decreases in enzyme activity (SCH- 23390 [D 1], spiperone [D 2], pimozide [D 2]) as did two DA indirect agonists, <b>amfonelic</b> <b>acid</b> and nomifensine. The inhibitory effect of the agonists was not antagonized by the less active antagonists, SCH- 23390 [D 1] or spiperone [D 2]. Taken together these results suggest that the inhibitory effects do not involve specific binding of DA or its agonists/antagonists to dopaminergic receptors mediating changes in cAMP concentration. This conclusion is also supported by the observation that addition of dibutyryl cAMP did not change brain AA. It appears more likely that DA and dopaminergic drugs inhibit AA by a direct effect on the enzyme, as suggested by the competitive nature of DA and SKF- 38393 inhibition of AA (Ki's of 59 and 84 microM, respectively). The functional significance of this effect should still be demonstrated but this mechanism may represent an important physiological pathway through which neurotransmitters could rapidly affect steroid-dependent processes such as the neural synthesis of estrogens. This would provide a mean by which environmental stimuli could affect reproductive behavior and physiology. Peer reviewe...|$|E
