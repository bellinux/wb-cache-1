40|$|Horizontal {{directional}} drilling (HDD) involves pulling a new pipeline through a horizontal borehole. When installing a {{high density polyethylene}} (HDPE) pipe, axial stresses and strains develop as it is pulled into place. The potential service life of an HDPE pipe is likely controlled by these stresses and strains. Currently, pulling force equations are used to calculate maximum pulling force during an HDD installation. To better understand how axial stresses and strains developed in the pipe during and after installation, a pipe specimen was tested under a cyclic pulling force history. This simplified loading history involves a square wave with maximum axial stresses of 3. 8 MPa and minimum axial stresses of 0. 6 MPa. Axial strain accumulation during the experiment reached a peak of 0. 75 % {{at the end of}} the 60 minute simulation. The laboratory measurements were then compared with numerical simulations using both linear and nonlinear rheological models. Axial strain accumulation was best estimated using a nonlinear viscoelastic model.

At strain lower than 5 %, the HOMO-LUMO gap of (8, 0) BNNT remains at a constant value, but decreases at a larger strain. For the (5, 5) BNNT, the gap monotonically decreases when the strain becomes larger.

A non-linear strain-displacement relationship is also deployed to derive the geometric stiffness matrix due to the initial stresses and hydrostatic pressures.

40|$|Bolting is {{currently}} the most commonly accepted rock reinforcing method of dealing with rock strata instability in both surface and underground mines as well as civil engineering. Bolts are installed in fractured rock mass to build composite beams in weak strata or to attach weak excavation surfaces to deeper and competent rock layers to achieve stability. After opening, rock mass around the excavation space experiences stress redistribution and rock fracturing occurs in this process. Bolts installed in the fractured rock mass around excavations normally bear combined tensile and shear loads due to the opening and sliding of rock fractures. Direct shear restraint and high normal stress are applied by the bolt to the fracture surfaces to minimise their displacements. This mechanism allows the excavation surfaces to stabilise and makes them self-supporting. In the interactive process of rock mass and bolt, two load transfer mechanisms are involved: the <b>axial</b> <b>tensioning</b> (<b>axial</b> shearing at the bolt-grout interface, in essence) and the lateral shearing. <b>Axial</b> <b>tensioning</b> was the common focus in past studies, whereas lateral shearing is attracting more attention at present. The strength of the bolt when subjected to both shear and tensile loads is smaller than bolt strength when subjected to tensile load only. Thus, ignoring the shear load in bolting design probably leads to a higher safety factor. Hence, a deep understanding of bolt behaviour subjected to combined loads is essential in bolting system design and assessment. In the past, a number of experimental and theoretical investigations were conducted on the shear behaviour of the rock discontinuity reinforced by rock bolts and a few preliminary conclusions were drawn. Yet, few studies were performed on the shear behaviour of cable bolted rock discontinuities. Thus, this research investigated the shear performance of cable bolted rock discontinuities both experimentally and theoretically to provide more knowledge in this area. A series of experimental studies were undertaken to investigate the shear behaviour of cable bolted concrete joints (representing rock discontinuity) and relevant influencing factors. Double shear tests with joint friction were carried out and test results were analysed in respect of joint shear strength, joint shear displacement, joint shear stiffness, cable pre-tension effect, cable wire surface profile effect, cable failure mode and the shear force-axial force relationship. Double shear tests without joint friction were also carried out using a modified double shear test apparatus. By comparing the double shear tests with and without joint friction, the joint friction and the cable dowel effects on the shear behaviour of cabled concrete joints were studied. British standard single shear tests were also carried out on four cable bolts and were compared with double shear tests. The comparison showed that the joint shear strength from the British standard single shear tests was {{much smaller than the}} double shear test results and the reason was analysed. Bolts used in underground rock engineering include Fibre Glass (FG) bolts, steel rebar bolts and cable bolts. Since these three types of bolts have different mechanical properties, such as tensile strength, shear strength and axial tensile modulus, their reinforcing effect on rock discontinuities are expected to be different. Thus in this study, cable bolts were compared with FG bolts and steel rebar bolts in terms of reinforcing concrete joints with consideration of their basic mechanical properties. Comparison showed that the influence of their basic mechanical properties on their reinforcing effect on concrete joints was evident. Since the mechanical properties of FG bolts was completely different from the other two types, the FG bolt reinforcing effect on the concrete joint was entirely different. The reinforcing effect of cable bolts and steel rebar bolts was more similar due to their similar mechanical properties. Apart from the experimental investigations, an analytical study was also carried out based on the statically indeterminate beam theory and some conclusions drawn from existing test results, with consideration of most pertinent influencing factors. An analytical model was proposed and compared with the double shear test results, which showed close agreement. In the light of the proposed theoretical method, parametric investigations were performed on four influencing factors, including cable pre-tension, joint friction coefficient, concrete strength and cable installation angle. From the parametric investigations, it was known that the joint friction coefficient and the concrete strength influenced the cable bolted joint shear strength in a consistent manner. However, the cable pre-tension and the cable installation angle affected the cabled joint shear strength in an inconsistent manner. In addition, the cable pre-tension showed opposite influences on cabled joint shear strength when changing the cable failure modulus, which was consistent with the double shear tests on the plain wire cable and the indented wire cable...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} {{reinforced}} piled embankments {{is a complex}} soil-structure interaction problem involving embankment fill, geosynthetic reinforcement, a pile group and the soft underlying soil. In designing a reinforced piled embankment both vertical and horizontal equilibrium must be achieved. Lateral outward forces exist at the outer extremities of reinforced piled embankments {{and in order to}} achieve structural stability, this destabilizing force must be restrained to maintain equilibrium within the embankment and to limit excessive deformations. In this study, plane strain physical models of a reinforced piled embankment were investigated in a geotechnical centrifuge at up to 60 times Earth’s gravity (g). The centrifuge model facilitated the capturing of photographic images in-flight to allow the deformational response of the piled embankment to be assessed. Numerical analyses, using Plaxis 2 D, replicated the centrifuge model testing to allow further assessment of the deformational response, the stress along the geosynthetic and stress in the embankment fill above the reinforcement. Direct comparison of the data from the physical and numerical models largely validated Plaxis 2 D for use in the analysis of reinforced piled embankment. The analysis indicates that significant horizontal and vertical deformations occur in the reinforcement under the side slopes of reinforced piled embankments. Significant bending moments and pile head deflections were observed in the outer row of piles. Bending moments and deflections were present in all piles within the pile group. The analysis indicates that the pile group should extend for a greater distance towards the toe of the embankment than that currently recommended in BS 8006 (2010). The analysis indicated that an increase in the pile bending moment correlated to an increase of the horizontal and vertical deformation of the reinforcement and a decrease in the pile group efficacy.
