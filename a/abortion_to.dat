5|$|As an {{economic}} conservative, Kemp advocated low taxes and supply-side policies during his political career. His positions spanned the social spectrum, ranging from his conservative opposition to <b>abortion</b> <b>to</b> his more libertarian stances advocating immigration reform. As {{a proponent of}} both Chicago school and supply-side economics, he is notable as an influence upon the Reagan agenda and {{the architect of the}} Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which is known as the Kemp–Roth tax cut.|$|E
5|$|In Singapore, the Penal Code {{lays out}} {{sanctions}} for non-compliance with the Termination of Pregnancy Act, which limits <b>abortion</b> <b>to</b> {{women who have}} not been pregnant for more than 24 weeks. By not conferring the right to life upon fetuses younger than the stipulated period, the legislation has accorded greater weight to the safety and security of expectant mothers who are threatened by their unborn children. This is in contrast with the approach taken in the Philippines, where the Constitution provides that the state shall equally protect {{the life of the mother}} and the life of the unborn from conception. Similarly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms of the Czech Republic states that human life deserves to be protected before birth. Chances of a universal consensus on this issue are slim due to the difficulty in defining the beginning of life.|$|E
5|$|In {{her work}} How Kantian Ethics Should Treat Pregnancy and Abortion, Susan Feldman argues that {{abortion}} should be defended according to Kantian ethics. She proposed {{that a woman}} {{should be treated as}} a dignified autonomous person, with control over their body, as Kant suggested. She believes that the free choice of women would be paramount in Kantian ethics, requiring <b>abortion</b> <b>to</b> be the mother's decision. Dean Harris has noted that, if Kantian ethics is {{to be used in the}} discussion of abortion, it must be decided whether a fetus is an autonomous person. Kantian ethicist Carl Cohen argues that the potential to be rational or participation in a generally rational species is the relevant distinction between humans and inanimate objects or irrational animals. Cohen believes that even when humans are not rational because of age (such as babies or fetuses) or mental disability, agents are still morally obligated to treat them as an ends in themselves, equivalent to a rational adult such as a mother seeking an abortion.|$|E

25|$|While {{abortion}} remains {{illegal in}} Ireland, the constitutional ban {{on it was}} softened somewhat in 1992.

50|$|Proposed Legislative Amendment to the Constitution - The {{proposed}} {{constitutional amendment}} {{would allow the}} legislature to prohibit or regulate <b>abortions</b> <b>to</b> the extent permitted by the United States Constitution.

In May 2011, Brownback approved a bill prohibiting insurance companies from offering abortion coverage as part of general health plans unless the procedure is necessary to save a woman's life.

25|$|Abortion in Brunei {{is largely}} illegal, with an {{exception}} if a woman's life is danger. Previously, {{the penalty for}} receiving an abortion was up to seven years in prison, with 10-15 years for the person performing the abortion. In 2014, Brunei's government implemented Sharia criminal law {{in a series of}} phases which was set to increase the punishment for <b>abortion</b> <b>to</b> execution by stoning. This part of the law was to come into effect in 2016, although it's now expected to come into effect in 2018.

25|$|Roe v. Wade, , is a {{landmark}} {{decision by the}} United States Supreme Court {{on the issue of}} abortion. It was decided simultaneously with a companion case, Doe v. Bolton. The Court ruled 7–2 that a right to privacy under the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment extended to a woman's decision to have an abortion, but that this right must be balanced against the state's interests in regulating abortions: protecting women's health and protecting the potentiality of human life. Arguing that these state interests became stronger {{over the course of a}} pregnancy, the Court resolved this balancing test by tying state regulation of <b>abortion</b> <b>to</b> the third trimester of pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|During {{the same}} segment of The Today Show, Couric interviewed Dr. Ronald Wapner, head of {{maternal}} fetal medicine at New York Presbyterian Hospital, He discussed possible {{pros and cons}} of the test. His first concern was whether the stated accuracy rate achieved in the 2,000 test cases would be realized in real world usage. His second concern was whether couples who purchase the test might use the results for family balancing, which means the decision to utilize selective <b>abortion</b> <b>to</b> achieve a baby of the desired sex. Wapner said that one positive aspect of the Baby Gender Mentor test is the non-invasive nature of the test, which means there should be no risk of harm to the fetus.|$|E

The ACA already banned federal subsidies from being used <b>to</b> cover <b>abortions,</b> but did allow health insurance plans covering <b>abortions</b> <b>to</b> receive federal subsidies, so long as such funding was not directly used for abortion coverage. The Protect Life Act would have also allowed hospitals <b>to</b> refuse life-saving <b>abortions</b> <b>to</b> women in emergency situations.|$|R

25|$|Historically, abortions {{have been}} done using herbal medicines, sharp tools, with force, or through other {{traditional}} methods. Abortion laws and cultural or religious views of abortions are different around the world. In some areas abortion is legal only in specific cases such as rape, problems with the fetus, poverty, risk to a woman's health, or incest. In many places there is much debate over the moral, ethical, and legal issues of abortion. Those who oppose abortion often maintain that an embryo or fetus is a human with a right to life and may compare <b>abortion</b> <b>to</b> murder. Those who favor the legality of abortion often hold that a woman {{has a right to}} make decisions about her own body.|$|E

The next day, Zsa Zsa makes a joke when Leon speaks after saying nothing all day, and he leaves. She finds him and apologises, and comforts him as she did not realise how badly he was affected. He then tells her about when his mother {{died in a car}} crash. Phil ejects Zsa Zsa and Shirley from their home, {{incorrectly}} claiming that Shirley has conspired with his mother Peggy (Barbara Windsor) against him, leaving them homeless. They move in with Heather, but the landlord fails to make mortgage payments, meaning bailiffs turn up to take the house. They agree to squat but Shirley leaves the house, meaning they cannot return there. Zsa Zsa tells Shirley she is useless and would rather live in the gutter. She then asks Mercy if she can stay with her, and starts working in the café. Zsa Zsa later accidentally reveals that Lucy's miscarriage was actually an <b>abortion</b> <b>to</b> Jane, when she misunderstands Jane being upset over Lucy being dishonest about cheating to gain her grades.|$|E
