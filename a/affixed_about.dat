60|$|I {{have touched}} on {{infantry}} and artillery, and, though a previous chapter {{has been almost}} wholly devoted to the cavalry, I cannot resist the desire {{to get back to}} the horses and the lances again. The question of sword or lance as the cavalryman's weapon has long been argued, and it may be of interest to consider what are the views of those whose experience is the most recent. Though I have had no opportunity of witnessing the use of the lance, I have heard the opinions of many officers both of the Guides and the 11th Bengal Lancers. All admit or assert that the lance is in this warfare the better weapon. It kills with more certainty and convenience, and there is less danger of the horseman being cut down. As to length, the general opinion seems to be in favour of a shorter spear. This, with a counter poise at the butt, gives as good a reach and is much more useful for close quarters. Major Beatson, one of the most distinguished cavalry officers on the frontier, is a strong advocate of this. Either the pennon should be knotted, or a boss of some sort <b>affixed</b> <b>about</b> eighteen inches below the point. Unless this be done there is a danger of the lance penetrating too far, when it either gets broken or allows the enemy to wriggle up and strike the lancer. This last actually happened on several occasions.|$|E

50|$|Derivation {{within the}} verb phrase {{takes on a}} variety of characteristics. Derivational affixes can be {{classified}} into one of two categories: endocentric and exocentric, where endocentrically deriving <b>affixes</b> occur <b>about</b> twice as often as exocentric ones. The difference is established upon the change in distribution class which can {{take the form of a}} derivation of a verbal stem from a nominal basis or a transitive stem from an intransitive one.|$|R
5000|$|The next year, the Northern Neck was {{the site}} of another {{attempted}} uprising, this one led by [...] "Sam, a Negro Servt to Richard Metcalfe."

[...] "To deter him & others from the like evil practice for time to come," [...] the court ordered the sheriff of James City County to whip him severely, and return him to the Westmoreland County sheriff to be whipped again. Sam was sentenced to forever wear [...] "a strong Iron collar <b>affixed</b> <b>about</b> his neck with four sprigs." [...] Should he leave his master's plantation or remove the collar, he would be hanged.|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} decade, {{piezoelectric}} actuators as the active element in synthetic jets demonstrated {{that they could}} significantly enhance the overall lift on an airfoil. However, durability, system weight, size, and power have limited their use outside a laboratory. These problems are not trivial, since piezoelectric actuators are physically brittle and display limited displacement. The objective {{of this study is}} to characterize the relevant properties for the design of a synthetic jet utilizing three types of piezoelectric actuators as mechanical diaphragms, Radial Field Diaphragms, Thunders, and Bimorphs so that the shape cavity volume does not exceed 147. 5 cm 3 on a 7 cm x 7 cm aerial coverage. These piezoelectric elements were selected because of their geometry, and overall free-displacement. Each actuator was <b>affixed</b> <b>about</b> its perimeter in a cavity, and relevant parameters such as clamped displacement variations with voltage and frequency, air velocities produced through an aperture, and sound pressure levels produced by the piezoelectric diaphragms were measured...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic jets {{have been}} {{identified}} and utilized widely in airflow control applications. These jets of air are usually created {{by the use of}} compressed air, or an electromechanically driven vibrating platform. All of these approaches produce desired results in airflow-control such as enhanced lift and increased maneuverability. Despite the results however, system weight, size, response time and force limit their use in aircraft applications where space is a premium. The objective {{of this study is to}} characterize the relevant properties for the design of a synthetic jet utilizing three types of piezoelectric actuators as mechanical diaphragms. The limiting parameters of the actuators for this application are shape and volumetric space. Thus, the actuators were circular with a diameter of 6. 35 cm, and overall device cavity volume no larger than 147. 5 cm 3 on a 7 cm x 7 cm areal coverage. The actuators tested were pre-stressed curved metallic unimorphs, bimorphs, and radial field diaphragms. These piezoelectric elements were chosen because of their geometry, quasi-isostatic topography and overall free-displacement. Each actuator was <b>affixed</b> <b>about</b> its perimeter in a cavity, and relevant parameters such as clamped displacement, and jet velocity though a pre-determined dimensional slot, were measured...|$|E
50|$|As in {{many other}} {{indigenous}} languages of the Americas, a Nez Perce verb can have the meaning of an entire sentence in English. (This manner of providing {{a great deal of}} information in one word is called polysynthesis.) Verbal <b>affixes</b> provide information <b>about</b> the person and number of the subject and object, as well as tense and aspect (e.g. whether or not an action has been completed).|$|R
5000|$|Sir Colin set <b>about</b> <b>affixing</b> comital {{authority}} to his title, by marrying Isabel Stewart. In 1468 (5 years after William Stewart had surrendered the office), Sir Colin was acknowledged as the Lord of Lorne, {{which became a}} subsidiary title of the earldom. The traditional heraldic symbol of Lorn was the lymphad (a galley), so the coat of arms for the Lordship of Lorne became a black lymphad on a silver field, quartered with the Campbell family arms.|$|R
5000|$|The Sovereign and the Knights and Dames Grand Cross are allotted stalls in {{the choir}} of the chapel, above which their heraldic devices are displayed. Perched on the {{pinnacle}} of a knight's stall is his helm, decorated with a mantling and topped by his crest. Under English heraldic law, women other than monarchs do not bear helms or crests; instead, the coronet appropriate to the dame's rank, if there is one, is used. Above the crest or coronet, the stall's occupant's heraldic banner is hung, emblazoned {{with his or her}} coat of arms. At a considerably smaller scale, {{to the back of the}} stall is affixed a piece of brass (a [...] "stall plate") displaying its occupant's name, arms and date of admission into the Order. Upon the death of a Knight, the banner, helm, mantling and crest are taken down. The stall plates, however, are not removed; rather, they remain permanently <b>affixed</b> somewhere <b>about</b> the stall, so that the stalls of the chapel are festooned with a colourful record of the Order's Knights and Dames Grand Cross since 1906.|$|R
40|$|Three nests of Crabro tenuis {{were studied}} during June 1971 - 1972 in Oswego County, New York. Females {{constructed}} shallow but lengthy, multicelled nests in sand with the cells {{being built in}} clusters, sometimes in series. Females plugged the entrances with damp sand and occupied the burrows during midday. Paralyzed prey were stored head inward {{at the end of}} the burrow. The deeper cells in a cluster were excavated and provisioned first and the shallower cells built and stored later, as determined by the developmental stages of the wasps within the cells. From four to seven paralyzed, adult male flies were placed in a fully provisioned cell with their venters toward the center. Such a cell usually held only one species of fly. Provisions consisted of the suborders Brachycera and Cyclorrhapha and comprised the families Rhagionidae, Anthomyiidae and Tachinidae. An egg was <b>affixed</b> <b>about</b> equally to the left or right side of the neck of a fly and this prey was placed against or near the wall of the cell. The nesting traits of C. tenuis were compared with those of other members of the Cribrarius group, C. advena of the Advena, group, C. venator of the Tumidus group and species in the Hilaris group...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{explanations}} {{have been offered}} for the observed cross-linguistic preponderance of suffixes over prefixes. Many are couched in terms of synchronic advantages, such as the cognitive simplicity of cross-category harmony between syntax and morphology, and preferences for processing the lexical meaning in stems before the grammatical material in <b>affixes.</b> But hypotheses <b>about</b> functional advantages cannot constitute explanations in themselves without accounts of the mechanisms by which the advantages are translated into grammatical structure. Here it is shown that the numerous exceptions to such hypotheses can be explained when the individual histories of the affixes are considered, including both their sources and the steps by which they develop...|$|R
40|$|Joint affixes are the {{patterns}} which provide grammatical meaning references by forming complements or phrases. These patterns have occurred by {{the usage of}} multiple affixes in company. None of the <b>affixes</b> which bring <b>about</b> the joint <b>affixes,</b> can correspond {{the function of the}} joint affix itself in terms of both syntax and semantic. The affixes realize a new function by unifying. As convenient to this usage seventeen affix patterns have been fixed in Turkish. Ten of them are used with verbs and seven of them are used with nouns. The joint affixes which are used with verbs constitute adverbial participle phrases. The joint affixes which are used with nouns have the function of forming definite/chain noun complement, reduplication or phrases with two case affixes. In this study, functions of joint affixes with regard to semantic and syntax have been examine...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the current study is to {{investigate}} the use of one of the vocabulary learning strategies named word formation strategy (morphology) {{in terms of the number}} of affixes by English as foreign language (EFL) intermediate students in Qazvin Province in Iran. In order to investigate the variables, 43 intermediate EFL students in Qazvin Province were chosen randomly. The data were collected by using two separate tests. The results showed students who used word formation strategy have highest mean on the vocabulary test belongs to the root words followed by the single affixes and the third highest mean belongs to the double affixes. The data showed that students seemed not to have and employ word-building knowledge; they favored an approach which involved attention to the whole unit because they did not have enough knowledge of affixes. Then, the findings revealed that the more students learn <b>about</b> <b>affixes,</b> the better they perform on vocabulary learning. It is suggested that in order to further validate the general conclusions of the current study, more specific ethnographic research needs to be done and more participants needs in future studies...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the goals}} of Vocabulary through Morphemes is to learn the {{meanings}} of key morphemes (prefixes, roots, suffixes). However, the ultimate goal is for students to confidently infer unknown word meanings during independent reading in any subject area. Students can be taught to make this inference by combining information gleaned from the outside clues—the surrounding context around the word— and the inside clues—the morphemes inside the word. This is called the outside-in strategy (Ebbers & Denton, 2008). Effective teachers keep this key goal in mind, modeling the outside-in strategy frequently in order to help students become adept. Teachers can use a think-aloud procedures to help enable transfer of knowledge of affixes and roots to all reading materials across the curriculum. Thus, even though students eventually memorize the meanings of key prefixes and roots and become familiar with derivational suffixes, the greater goal is eventual independent application of this material to all texts. Another important goal of this program is to develop interest in words, etymology, word origins, analogies, derivatives, and word relationships. Interest should increase as self-efficacy increases, as students become more knowledgeable <b>about</b> <b>affixes,</b> roots, and word relationships. Interest is an important aspect of morphological awareness. Note: This curriculum is not a final authority on etymology, morphology, or linguistics i...|$|R
50|$|The Undergoer/Actor <b>affixes</b> carry {{information}} <b>about</b> Person (1, 2, 3), Number (sg., pl.), sometimes Gender (3.sg.m/3.sg.f), Tense (distant past, present, future), Aspect (perfective, imperfective, progressive) and, in some cases, spatial deixis (locative ‘over there’). When {{talking about}} events as being {{located in the}} past, present or future (tense) and when talking about these events from different viewpoints (aspect), different combinatorics between Undergoer prefixes and Actor suffixes apply. Table 5 below is a very simplified version of this combined Undergoer/Actor- and Tense/Aspect-marking verb inflection system. It {{is representative of the}} inflections on transitive and intransitive verbs. The prefix and suffix slots in Table 5 are the appropriate forms for third person singular referents (note: the prefixes are also specified for gender, here: masculine). Note that for intransitive verbs, the Actor is always indicated via the verbal prefix set; the suffixes are invariant but morphologically they correspond to the third person singular Actor suffix of transitive verbs. The suffix slots that are zero-marked for the person/number value ‘third person singular’ (e.g. No. 3 and 5) are not necessarily zero-marked for all other person/number values (of course, this only applies to transitive verbs); e.g. for ‘third person plural’ you get -a for both suffix slots in No. 3 and 5. Also note that the verb root may occur in two different forms: ‘common root’ (C) or ‘limited action root’ (L). In particular, the selection of verb root has an effect on the durative vs. non-durative reading of the action referred to. And finally, note that whenever we have past tense or future tense reference, the inflected verb form may be preceded by a time adverb: tó ‘past’ or ya ‘future’.|$|R
