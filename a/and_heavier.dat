5|$|The primary {{decay mode}} for {{isotopes}} lighter than technetium-98 (98Tc) is electron capture, producing molybdenum (Z=42). For technetium-98 <b>and</b> <b>heavier</b> isotopes, the primary mode is beta emission (the emission of an electron or positron), producing ruthenium (Z=44), {{with the exception}} that technetium-100 can decay both by beta emission and electron capture.|$|E

40|$|Human {{activities}} {{have resulted in}} arsenic (As) <b>and</b> <b>heavy</b> metals accumulation in paddy soils in China. Phytoremediation has been suggested as an effective and low-cost method to clean up contaminated soils. A combined soil-sand pot experiment was conducted to investigate the influence of red mud (RM) supply on iron plaque formation <b>and</b> As <b>and</b> <b>heavy</b> metal accumulation in two wetland plant species (Cyperus alternifolius Rottb., Echinodorus amazonicus Rataj), using As <b>and</b> <b>heavy</b> metals polluted paddy soil combined with three rates of RM application (0, 2 %, 5 %). The results showed that RM supply significantly decreased As <b>and</b> <b>heavy</b> metals accumulation in shoots of the two plants due to the decrease of As <b>and</b> <b>heavy</b> metal availability <b>and</b> the enhancement {{of the formation of}} iron plaque on the root surface and in the rhizosphere. Both wetland plants supplied with RM tended to have more Fe plaque, higher As <b>and</b> <b>heavy</b> metals on roots and in their rhizospheres, and were more tolerant of As <b>and</b> <b>heavy</b> metal toxicity. The results suggest that RM-induced enhancement of the formation of iron plaque on the root surface and in the rhizosphere of wetland plants may be significant for remediation of soils contaminated with As <b>and</b> <b>heavy</b> metals...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the gray}} mouse lemur {{displays}} multi-male, multi-female mating patterns, {{studies have shown}} that females do exhibit indirect mate selection (a form of selected polyandry). During the study, females would mate with 1–7 males up to 11 times during their single night of receptivity, but would avoid or counteract males that attempted to monopolize mating. Dominant males that attempt to monopolize tend to be larger <b>and</b> <b>heavier</b> individuals. Female selection however, has been shown to help increase genetic diversity among offspring.|$|E
5|$|As the war progressed and Germany's lighter {{tanks were}} {{replaced}} by the Panzer III, Panzer IV <b>and</b> <b>heavier</b> tanks, such as the Panther, the T-26 was gradually replaced through attrition by the vastly superior T-34. The remaining T-26s participated in battles with the Germans and their allies during the Battle of Moscow from 1941–42, the Battle of Stalingrad and the Battle of the Caucasus from 1942–1943. Some tank units of the Leningrad Front used their T-26 tanks until 1944.|$|E

In particular the latter had found a way to short-circuit the original Leslie speakers of his Hammond organ C-3 and connect the instrument directly into the stacks of Marshall amps, obtaining a roaring sound and matching the guitar in loudness.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, the Austro-Hungarian Navy {{began to}} build armored cruisers to support the battle fleet and to perform some of the roles then {{reserved}} only for battleships.

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{findings indicate that}} tobacco use and alcohol use among African-Americans is a major public health issue. The objectives of this study were: (a) to examine the prevalence of tobacco <b>and</b> <b>heavy</b> alcohol consumption risks among African-Americans, (b) to examine whether there are gender differences in tobacco <b>and</b> <b>heavy</b> alcohol consumption risks among African-Americans, and (c) to identify sociodemographic factors {{that are associated with}} tobacco <b>and</b> <b>heavy</b> alcohol consumption risks among the African-American population. This study utilized data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which is a telephone-based survey, designed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ^ Analytic strategies utilized were descriptive statistics, chi square, and logistic regression analyses. Bivariate results indicated that there were significant gender differences in tobacco use <b>and</b> <b>heavy</b> alcohol consumption risks among African-Americans. Multivariate analyses showed that females {{were less likely to be}} at risk of tobacco use <b>and</b> <b>heavy</b> alcohol consumption, even after controlling for the effect of other socio-demographic variables.

5|$|The Admiralty {{predicted}} that all Majestic-class carriers would require upgrades to their aircraft lifts and arrester gear {{in the early}} 1950s, to operate the faster <b>and</b> <b>heavier</b> carrier aircraft under development.

The installation of an angled flight deck and mirror landing aid, would have allowed Sydney to operate modern jet aircraft. However, financial and manpower restrictions led to the cancellation of this program.|$|E

5|$|After the {{municipal}} merger between Oslo and Aker in 1948, Akersbanerne was merged into Oslo Sporveier, although Holmenkolbanen remained a partially owned subsidiary.

The municipal take-over resulted in an upgrade to both the track and the rolling stock. New overhead wires and new <b>and</b> <b>heavier</b> track were laid.

5|$|Both methods offered {{advantages}} and disadvantages, though in general greater muzzle velocity meant increased barrel wear. As guns fire, their barrels wear out, losing accuracy and eventually requiring replacement. At times, this became problematic; the US Navy seriously considered stopping practice firing of heavy guns in 1910 {{because of the}} wear on the barrels. The disadvantages of guns of larger calibre are that guns and turrets must be heavier; <b>and</b> <b>heavier</b> shells, which are fired at lower velocities, require turret designs that allow a larger angle of elevation for the same range. Heavier shells {{have the advantage of}} being slowed less by air resistance, retaining more penetrating power at longer ranges.|$|E
