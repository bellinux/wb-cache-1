First, we {{compiled}} a list of 185 beta Pictoris members and candidate members from 35 representative works. Next, we used the Aladin and STILTS virtual observatory tools, and the PPMXL proper motion and Washington Double Star catalogues to look for companion candidates. The resulting potential companions were subjects of a dedicated astro-photometric follow-up using public data from all-sky surveys. After discarding 67 sources by proper motion and 31 by colour-magnitude diagrams, we obtained a final list of 36 common proper motion systems. The binding energy of two of them is perhaps too small to be considered physically bound. Results. Of the 36 pairs and multiple systems, eight are new, 16 have only one stellar component previously classified as a beta Pictoris member, and three have secondaries at or below the hydrogen-burning limit.

50|$|A multi-partial {{approach}} to facilitation differs from both a neutral or impartial approach, {{as well as}} a model in which the facilitator acts as an advocate, such as in many feminist models. Multi-partial facilitation acknowledges the presence of “dominant narratives”, within dialogue, or sets of assumptions and beliefs based on socialization and cultural values. If the facilitator were to be impartial and neutral in moments of conflict between dialogue participants, the dominant narrative would affirm the experiences and voices of the dominant group members and further marginalize the experience of marginalized participants. A multi-partial facilitation approach differs from facilitator-advocate approaches in that it is equally invested in the participation and growth of all dialogue participants; it encourages self-reflection and awareness through engagement rather than direct confrontation, an approach {{based on the belief that}} “people who are not feeling threatened are more open to discussing their feelings and interests and are more open to discussing the effects the conflict is having on both groups.” Rather than directly confronting <b>a</b> group <b>member’s</b> <b>bias,</b> <b>a</b> multi-partial facilitator “pursues” the dominant narrative and encourages group members to share their experiences, while simultaneously encouraging a critical analysis of the underlying assumptions and narratives at play.|$|R

40|$|The rhizosphere, {{the thin}} layer of soil {{surrounding}} and influenced by plant roots, defines a distinct and selective microbial habitat compared to unplanted soil. The microbial communities inhabiting the rhizosphere, the rhizosphere microbiota, engage in interactions with their host plants which span from parasitism to mutualism. Therefore, the rhizosphere microbiota emerges {{as one of the}} determinants of yield potential in crops. Studies conducted with different plant species have unequivocally pointed to the host plant as a driver of the microbiota thriving at the root–soil interface. Thus far, the host genetic traits shaping the rhizosphere microbiota are not completely understood. As root hairs {{play a critical role in}} resource exchanges between plants and the rhizosphere, we hypothesized that they can act as a determinant of the microbiota thriving at the root–soil interface. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of barley (Hordeum vulgare) mutant lines contrasting for their root hair characteristics. Plants were grown in two agricultural soils, differentiating in their organic matter contents, under controlled environmental conditions. At early stem elongation rhizosphere specimens were collected and subjected to high-resolution 16 S rRNA gene profiling. Our data revealed that the barley rhizosphere microbiota is largely dominated by members of the phyla Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, regardless of the soil type and the root hair characteristics of the host plant. Conversely, ecological indices calculated using operational taxonomic units (OTUs) presence, abundance, and phylogeny revealed a significant impact of root hair mutations on the composition of the rhizosphere microbiota. In particular, our data indicate that mutant plants host a reduced-complexity community compared to wild-type genotypes and unplanted soil controls. Congruently, the host genotype explained up to 18 % of the variation in ecological distances computed for the rhizosphere samples. Importantly, this effect is manifested in a soil-dependent manner. A closer inspection of the sequencing profiles revealed that the root hair-dependent diversification of the microbiota is supported by a taxonomically narrow group of bacteria, with <b>a</b> <b>bias</b> for <b>members</b> of the orders Actinomycetales, Burkholderiales, Rhizobiales, Sphingomonadales, and Xanthomonadales. Taken together, our results indicate that the presence and function of root hairs are a determinant of the bacterial community thriving in the rhizosphere and their perturbations can markedly impact on the recruitment of individual members of the microbiota...|$|R
