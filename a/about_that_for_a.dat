500|$|The album's {{title track}} was said by band members {{to be the}} {{continuation}} of [...] "Final Six", which was an outtake from their previous album. [...] "Final Six" [...] origins deal with the apocalypse. [...] "Human Strain" [...] deals with apocalyptic origins as well. The track was explained by guitarist Jeff Hanneman to initially be about the human race dying off by a mutative disease. The title of [...] "Public Display of Dismemberment" [...] refers to the consequences that countries outside of the United States give to citizens for crimes. Tom Araya said that [...] "Unit 731" [...] is [...] "very similar to Josef Mengele {{in the sense that}} it was a medical unit in the military, which was a Japanese military unit, actually. They did kind of the same thing; they tested the limits of the human body and recorded it for scientific purposes." [...] "Playing With Dolls" [...] is about a child witnessing a serial killer. [...] "Beauty Through Order" [...] is about Elizabeth Báthory, the most prolific female serial killer. Jeff Hanneman explained: [...] "I've been meaning to write a song <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time. I couldn't figure out the angle, I was thinking, 'How does a woman write? I can't write like a woman I'm a guy!' Then I just figured, 'Well, she's evil; she has lots of power and killed people.' So I just started writing and the lyrics and they came out." [...] Slayer revealed to Revolver that the track [...] "Snuff" [...] has no lyrical concept. [...] "Psychopathy Red" [...] was inspired by the Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo.|$|E

Character is the inherent complex of attributes that determine a person’s moral and ethical actions and reactions. There are many words that describe good character—words such as honest, inspiring, courageous, unselfish, competent, tactful, loyal, trustworthy, respectful, responsible, fair, caring and citizenship. We will examine the last six in much more detail later in this manuscript. Bennis (1989) said that after vision and passion, integrity (character) is the most fundamental trait of a leader.

40|$|AbstractIn certain {{non-stoichiometric}} {{transition metal}} oxides, crystallographic shear planes are found instead of isolated oxygen vacancies. These planes tend to form arrays with regular spacings. The interactions {{responsible for this}} ordering have not been understood in the past. We propose that the major interaction comes from elastic strain, with smaller electrostatic terms: {{the configuration of the}} planes is one which minimises the elastic strain energy. Quantitative results are given <b>for</b> <b>a</b> realistic model, and agree with the main features observed experimentally. Thus the regular array of planes is stable, and the equilibrium separation of planes in the array is <b>about</b> half <b>that</b> predicted <b>for</b> <b>an</b> isolated pair of planes. The interaction between isolated planes proves an oscillatory function of their separation. One can understand from its detailed form why the observed mean spacing gets smaller as the planes come together to form larger groups...|$|R

(1) The time required <b>for</b> <b>a</b> particular allele to become extinct in a population under the effects of mutation, selection, and random genetic drift is studied. In the absence of selection, the mean extinction time of an allele with an initial frequency close to 1 is {{of the order of}} the reciprocal of the mutation rate when 4 Nv << 1, where N is the effective population size and v is the mutation rate per generation. Advantageous mutations reduce the extinction time considerably, whereas deleterious mutations increase it tremendously even if the effect on fitness is very slight. (2) Mathematical formulae are derived for the distribution and the moments of extinction time of a particular allele from one or both of two related populations or species under the assumption of no selection. When 4 Nv << 1, the mean extinction time is <b>about</b> half <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single population, if the two populations are descended from a common original stock. (3) The expected number as well as the proportion of common neutral alleles shared by two related species at the tth generation after their separation are studied. It is shown that if 4 Nv is small, the two species are expected to share a high proportion of common alleles even 4 N generations after separation. In addition to the above mathematical studies, the implications of our results for the common alleles at protein loci in related Drosophila species and for the degeneration of unused characters in cave animals are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Given {{sufficient}} warning {{we might}} try to avert a collision with a comet or asteroid by using beamed energy or by using the kinetic energy of an interceptor rocket. If motivated by the opportunity to convert the object into a space asset, perhaps <b>a</b> microgravity mine <b>for</b> construction materials or spacecraft fuels, we might try a rendezvous to implant a propulsion system of some sort. But the most cost-effective means of disruption is a nuclear explosive. In this paper, I discuss optimal tactics for terminal intercept, which can be extended to remote-interdiction scenarios as well. I show that the optimal mass ratio of an interceptor rock carrying a nuclear explosive depends mainly on {{the ratio of the}} exhaust velocity to the assailant-object closing velocity. I compare the effectiveness of stand-off detonation, surface burst, and penetration, for both deflection and pulverization, concluding that a penetrator has no clear advantage over <b>a</b> surface-burst device <b>for</b> deflection, but is a distinctly more capable pulverizer. The advantage of a stand-off device is to distribute the impulse more evenly over the surface of the object and to prevent fracture, an event which would greatly complicate the intercept problem. Finally, I present some results of <b>a</b> model <b>for</b> gravitationally bound objects and obtain the maximum non-fracturing deflection speed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> variety of object sizes and structures. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> single engagement, I conclude that the non-fracturing deflection speed obtainable with a stand-off device is about four times the speed obtainable with a surface-burst device. Furthermore, the non-fracturing deflection speed is somewhat dependent on the number of competent components of the object, the speed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 13 component object being <b>about</b> twice <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 135 component object...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRoom-temperature {{plasticity}} in {{metallic glasses}} (MGs) is {{commonly associated with}} local structural heterogeneity; however, direct observation of the subtle structural change caused by plasticity is vitally important but the data are extremely scarce. Based on dynamic atomic force microscopy (DAFM), here we show that plasticity-induced structural evolution in a Zr-Ni MG can be revealed via nano-scale viscoelastic contacts between an AFM tip and plastically deformed MG surface layers. Our experimental results clearly show a spatial amplification of the nano-scale structural heterogeneity caused by the distributed plastic flow, which {{can be linked to}} the limited growth, reorientation and agglomeration of some nano-scale energy-absorbing regions, which are reminiscent of the behavior of the defect-like regions with non-affine deformation as conceived in many theories and models. Furthermore, we are able to experimentally extract the thermodynamic properties of these nano-scale regions, which possess an energy barrier of 0. 3 - 0. 5 eV, <b>about</b> half of <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> typical shear transformation event that usually occurs at the onset of plasticity.

[7] provided a larger value α (i.e., 1 / 4 <b>for</b> <b>an</b> 8 × 8 DCT), which provided a more stringent condition for detecting AZBs. Sousa [9] refined the model proposed by Zhou et al. and derived a more precise α (i.e., α = 1 / 4 cos ^ 2 (π/ 16)). Ji et al. [2] refined Sousa’s model using a combination of SAD and row-based SAD as the threshold criterion. Their method not only derived a more precise sufficient condition for detecting AZBs than Sousa’s but also provided conditions for the early detection of PZBs with 34 and 16 zero-quantized coefficients in an 8 × 8 block. After the H. 264 standard was launched to address a new generation of multimedia applications, the implications of the employment by the standard of an integer 4 × 4 DCT and scaling multiplication to avoid division for quantization were studied [3, 4], and an upper bound-based method was extended to AZB detection in H. 264 /AVC. The advantage of upper bound-based methods is that they do not incur a false positive error. However, these methods determine the thresholds by approximating the individual elements of a transform matrix by a theoretical maximum value at different frequency positions. The deviation between the upper bound and the actual maximum value of the DCT coefficients increases as the TB size increases. Therefore, extending these methods to TBs greater than 8 × 8 reduces the detection ratio. Taking a 16 × 16 TB, for example, the SAD value is on average four times the SAD value of any of its four quadrants (i.e., 8 × 8 blocks). Using the method proposed in [9], the sufficient condition for AZB detection is <b>about</b> twice <b>that</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> 8 × 8 block.|$|R

40|$|We present here an {{analysis}} of the light curves of 5. 3 million stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud observed by EROS (Experience de Recherche d'Objets Sombres). One star exhibits a variation that is best interpreted as due to gravitational microlensing by an unseen object. This candidate was also reported by the MACHO collaboration. The Einstein radius crossing time is 123 days (once corrected for blending), corresponding to lensing by a Halo object of 2. 6 ^{+ 8. 2 }_{- 2. 3 } Msun. The maximum magnification is a factor of 2. 6. The light curve also displays a periodic modulation with a 2. 5 % amplitude and a period of 5. 1 ~days. Parallax analysis of the candidate indicates that a Halo lens would need to have a mass of at least 1. 2 Msun, although a lens in the SMC could have a mass as low as 0. 1 Msun. We estimate the optical depth for microlensing towards the SMC due to this event to be ~ 3. 3 10 ^{- 7 }, with an uncertainty dominated by Poisson statistics. We show that this optical depth corresponds to <b>about</b> half <b>that</b> expected <b>for</b> <b>a</b> spherical isothermal Galactic Halo comprised solely of such objects, and that it is consistent with SMC self-lensing if the SMC is elongated along the line-of-sight by at least 5 kpc...|$|R

Comparable values <b>for</b> <b>A.</b> viscosus cells were at pHs of about 7. 0 and 5. 6.

The field {{metabolic}} rate (FMR) and water flux of the herbivorous Namib sand-dune lizard, Angolosaurus skoogi, was measured {{during the summer}} non-breeding period (early January) by means of doubly labelled water. FMR was <b>about</b> half <b>that</b> expected <b>for</b> <b>a</b> lizard of this size. Water flux and laboratory measured standard {{metabolic rate}}s were, however, typical of other desert lizards. It thus appeared a priori that this species was behaviourally reducing metabolic costs through reduced activity. This generated questions {{with regard to the}} ecological and physiological significance of low FMRs. Is the reduction forced by intolerable environmental conditions or the need to stay in positive water and energy balance? Alternatively, is activity reduction voluntary and geared towards optimizing growth and storage, possibly in preparation for periods of physiological stress ? The research required to answer these questions forms the basis of this thesis. There has been much discussion about the evolutionary and ecological significance of growth rates. The consensus seems to be that, under most circumstances, animals are adapted in ways that maximize growth or optimize growth in relation to realistically attainable rates of gross energy intake. Animal behaviour may be influenced by factors unrelated to growth considerations such as starvation, involuntary hypo/hyperthermia, predator evasion and social interactions. These factors may be difficult to identify and isolate, making this hypothesis difficult to test. Previous studies on the biology of A. skoogi have shown that this species has a perennially available food source, a wide range of potential body temperatures at its disposal and a low predation risk. Social interaction appear to be confined to the breeding season. This species is thus a particularly suitable subject <b>for</b> <b>a</b> scope <b>for</b> growth optimization study...|$|R
