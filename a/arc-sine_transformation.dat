40|$|The clonal and inter-clonal {{combining}} {{ability of}} fruit {{set in a}} Hevea brasiliensis four-parent diallel mating was evaluated using a randomized complete block experimental design with three replicates. Twelve main and reciprocal crosses were hand pollinated and percentage fruit set was recorded. The raw data were subjected to an <b>arc-sine</b> <b>transformation</b> for analysis of variance, and general and specific combining ability. There was significant variation of each of fruit set for the various crosses, general combining ability and reciprocal effect. The breeding implications of these results are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effects of}} caging on the {{colonization}} {{and development of}} the fouling community in the upper Bonny estuary was studied. The experimental design was such that sets of wooden panels (20 x 20 cm) were screened with cages constructed with plastic netting while another set was left uncaged. Both sets of panels were submerged below low tide level and sampled fortnightly for seventy-four days. The species settling on the panels (as well as on the mesh of the cage) were identified and examined for percentage cover. Data obtained were subjected to Analyis of Variance or t-tests after <b>arc-sine</b> <b>transformation.</b> Faunal abundance was found to be significantly higher on the mesh of the cage than on the panels (p< 0. 001). Differences between the caged and uncaged panels were influenced by time as total cover was found to decline with time on the caged panels. Pennaria distichia, Styela sp. and Sabella sp. achieved significantly higher cover on the mesh of the cage than the panels (p< 0. 001). Some species that settled on the panels (Balanus sp., Membranipora membranacea, Serpula sp, Halichondria sp, Crassostrea gasar) were not found on the mesh of the cage, and both Balanus and M...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Prosthetic joint {{infection}} is an uncommon but serious complication of hip replacement. There {{are two main}} surgical treatment options, with the choice largely based on the preference of the surgeon. Evidence is required regarding the comparative effectiveness of one-stage and two-stage revision to prevent reinfection after prosthetic joint infection. Methods We conducted a systematic review to identify randomised controlled trials, systematic reviews and longitudinal studies in unselected patients with infection treated exclusively by one- or two-stage methods or by any method. The Embase, MEDLINE and Cochrane databases were searched up to March 2011. Reference lists were checked, and citations of key articles were identified by using the ISI Web of Science portal. Classification of studies and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers. The outcome measure studied was reinfection within 2 years. Data were combined to produce pooled random-effects estimates using the Freeman-Tukey <b>arc-sine</b> <b>transformation.</b> Results We identified 62 relevant studies comprising 4, 197 patients. Regardless of treatment, the overall rate of reinfection after any treatment was 10. 1 % (95 % CI = 8. 2 to 12. 0). In 11 studies comprising 1, 225 patients with infected hip prostheses who underwent exclusively one-stage revision, the rate of reinfection was 8. 6 % (95 % CI = 4. 5 to 13. 9). After two-stage revision exclusively in 28 studies comprising 1, 188 patients, the rate of reinfection was 10. 2 % (95 % CI = 7. 7 to 12. 9). Conclusion Evidence of the relative effectiveness of one- and two-stage revision in preventing reinfection of hip prostheses is largely based on interpretation of longitudinal studies. There is no suggestion in the published studies that one- or two stage methods have different reinfection outcomes. Randomised trials are needed to establish optimum management strategies. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Cervical {{cancer is}} a major public health problem in Latin America and the Caribbean (LA&C), showing {{some of the highest}} {{incidence}} and mortality rates worldwide. Information on HPV type distribution in high-grade cervical lesions (HSIL) and invasive cervical cancer (ICC) is crucial to predict the future impact of HPV 16 / 18 vaccines and screening programmes, and to establish an appropriate post-vaccinal virologic surveillance. The aim was to assess the prevalence of HPV types in HSIL and ICC in studies in LA&C. Methods and Findings: We performed a systematic review, following the MOOSE guidelines for systematic reviews of observational studies, and the PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Inclusion criteria were at least ten cases of HSIL/ICC, and HPV-type elicitation. The search, without language restrictions, was performed in MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, LILACS from inception date to December 2009, proceedings, reference lists and consulting experts. A meta-analysis was performed using <b>arc-sine</b> <b>transformations</b> to stabilize the variance of simple proportions. Seventy-nine studies from 18 countries were identified, including 2446 cases of HSIL and 5540 of ICC. Overall, 46. 5 % of HSIL cases harbored HPV 16 and 8. 9 % HPV 18; in ICC, 53. 2 % of cases harbored HPV 16 and 13. 2 % HPV 18. The next five most common types, in decreasing frequency, were HPV 31, 58, 33, 45, and 52. Studyâ€™s limitations comprise the crosssectional design of most included studies and their inherent risk of bias, the lack of representativeness, and variations in th...|$|R
