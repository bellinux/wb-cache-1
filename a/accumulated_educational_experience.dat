40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that <b>educational</b> <b>experiences</b> lead to positive outcomes {{for reasons other than}} gains in cognitive abilities. Specifically, non-cognitive skills (i. e. personality traits) may change as a result of <b>educational</b> <b>experiences</b> (Heckman et al., 2010). To date, the idea that <b>educational</b> <b>experiences</b> contribute to changes in personality traits has received very little empirical support. The current study examines the relationship between <b>educational</b> <b>experiences</b> and personality trait development in a large German sample across four waves beginning in high school and throughout college. Findings suggest that personality traits in high school predict the type of <b>educational</b> <b>experiences</b> students have in college. Secondly, a number of <b>educational</b> <b>experiences</b> are associated with changes in personality traits. For example, going to class and spending more time on one???s homework is associated with increases in conscientiousness while having fewer stressful experiences are associated with decreases in neuroticism. Similarly, changes in <b>educational</b> <b>experiences</b> are associated with changes in personality traits, suggesting a reciprocal relationship between <b>educational</b> <b>experiences</b> and personality traits. Finally, a series of auto-regressive and auto-regressive latent trajectory (ALT) models found evidence that <b>educational</b> <b>experiences</b> can lead to changes in personality traits and vice-versa. Overall, this study suggests that educational contexts are important for the development of personality traits. Viewed in this light, one learns more in school than just class material...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} College of Agriculture students' perceptions {{and concerns about}} international <b>educational</b> <b>experiences.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine students' perceptions about international <b>educational</b> <b>experiences,</b> students' interests in gaining international <b>educational</b> <b>experiences,</b> students' ratings of selected factors that may prompt them to acquire these experiences, or barriers that prohibit them from gaining international <b>educational</b> <b>experiences.</b> A stratified random sample of students (N = 153) was asked to complete an online questionnaire. The response rate was 67 percent. Participants (n = 98) included 27 from Tarleton State University and 71 from Texas A & M University. The instrument included items to measure students' interests and preferences for international <b>educational</b> <b>experiences,</b> factors that influenced (motivated or prohibited) students' desires to gain international <b>educational</b> <b>experiences,</b> and perceptions of international <b>educational</b> <b>experiences.</b> Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation) and correlations were used to analyze the data. The results showed that only 4 percent of the respondents had participated in study abroad programs. About 77 percent of the respondents were interested in gaining international <b>educational</b> <b>experiences.</b> Students believed that gaining international <b>educational</b> <b>experiences</b> helped them enrich their overall life experience, seek opportunities to live in another country or culture, and helped their resume. Respondents were willing to join the study abroad program held by their universities. They preferred to register for a university faculty-led study abroad, spending one to ten weeks abroad, university study abroad course as an internship, directed study, research project, or similar international experience, and register for university courses at a university study center. The barriers students faced were financial constraints [...] paying for the program or funding personal living expenses and studies during the study abroad, finding affordable and adequate housing [...] and language barriers. Students who believed that joining in study abroad programs would improve their competitiveness in the global marketplace were more willing to gain international <b>educational</b> <b>experiences</b> than students who didn't think that joining in study abroad programs would improve their competitiveness in the global marketplace...|$|R

40|$|While {{the impact}} of racial {{identity}} on students' <b>educational</b> <b>experiences</b> has been studied for years, {{there has been little}} such research focused on multiracial individuals. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore how racial identity has shaped the <b>educational</b> <b>experiences</b> of multiracial undergraduates, particularly in their transition to college. Transitioning into college from high school, which often requires entering a very different social and educational environment, can be life changing for students, and racial identity can play a role in how students interact and identify with other students as well as teachers. An interview based qualitative methodology was used to explore the <b>educational</b> <b>experiences</b> of four multiracial undergraduate students. Individual face-to-face interviews were used to learn about the four participants' experiences. Focusing on multiracial students, who are often left out of the discussion when talking about the impact racial identity has on various <b>educational</b> <b>experiences,</b> will contribute to research on the relationship between racial identity and education. Study findings showed that the participants experienced few, if any, negative effects on their <b>educational</b> <b>experiences,</b> due to their racial identity or how others perceived them, racially. Overall, participants felt that being multiracial was an advantage in terms of connecting with a diverse group of peers in school settings...|$|R
