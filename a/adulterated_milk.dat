40|$|Massese is an Italian sheep breed, {{with black}} or grey coat colour, mainly reared in the Tuscany and Emilia Romagna regions. Recently, the {{emerging}} interests in this breed {{have resulted in}} the production of Pecorino cheese obtained with only Massese milk. In order to be profitable, this marketing link between Massese breed and its products should be defended against fraudsters who could include milk of other sheep breeds or cow milk in Massese labelled productions. To identify the genetic factors affecting coat colour in sheep, we have recently analysed the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC 1 R) gene and identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In this work, as a first step to set up a DNA based protocol for authentication of Massese dairy products, we further investigated the presence and distribution of one of these SNPs (c. - 31 G>A) in 143 Massese sheep and in another 13 sheep breeds (for a total of 351 animals). The Massese breed was fixed for allele c. - 31 A, whereas in all other breeds allele c. - 31 G was the most frequent or with frequency of 0 · 50. At the same nucleotide position the cattle MC 1 R gene carries the G nucleotide. Using these data we developed a method to detect <b>adulterating</b> <b>milk</b> (from other sheep breeds or from cow) in Massese dairy products based on the analysis of the c. - 31 G>A SNP.

The Vellimedupettai police on complaints from local residents on 19 August 2014 raided the vehicles and found that milk vans carrying supplies to Aavin in Chennai were diverted midway and adulterated with water. The police arrested eight people involved, but found that they were involved in the business for the past six months. Initial investigations revealed that the modus operandi was diversion of hundreds of milk tankers (each having 12,000 litres of milk) near a preset post in Tindivanam, where 2,000 litres of milk were taken off from the sealed containers and refilled with water. All the tankers were owned by AIADMK party person N. Vaidyanathan. The stolen milk was siphoned off to private milk agencies, which sold or produced dairy products. The investigation also revealed that the operation was carried out for more than ten years.

To test this hypothesis we investigated 3 types of milk: cow, goat, and sheep milk. From these, 4 mixtures were prepared. The first 3 were binary mixtures of sheep and cow milk, goat and cow milk, or sheep and goat milk; in all mixtures the mixtures contained between 0 and 100 % of each milk in increments of 5 %. The fourth combination was a tertiary mixture containing sheep, cow, and goat milk also in increments of 5 %. Analysis by FT-IR spectroscopy in combination with multivariate statistical methods, including partial least squares (PLS) regression and nonlinear kernel partial least squares (KPLS) regression, were used for multivariate calibration to quantify the different levels of <b>adulterated</b> <b>milk.</b> The FT-IR spectra showed a reasonably good predictive value for the binary mixtures, with an error level of 6. 5 to 8 % when analyzed using PLS.

Nestlé affirmed that all its products were safe and were not made from <b>milk</b> <b>adulterated</b> with melamine. On 2 October 2008, the Taiwan Health ministry announced that six types of milk powders produced in China by Nestlé contained low-level traces of melamine, and were [...] "removed from the shelves". As of 2013, Nestlé has implemented initiatives to prevent contamination and utilizes what it calls a [...] "factory and farmers" [...] model that eliminates the middleman. Farmers bring milk directly to a network of Nestlé-owned collection centers, where a computerized system samples, tests, and tags each batch of milk. To reduce further the risk of contamination at the source, the company provides farmers with continuous training and assistance in cow selection, feed quality, storage, and other areas. In 2014, the company opened the Nestlé Food Safety Institute (NFSI) in Beijing that will help meet China's growing demand for healthy and safe food, {{one of the top}} three concerns among Chinese consumers. The NFSI announced it would work closely with authorities to help provide a scientific foundation for food-safety policies and standards, with support to include early management of food-safety issues and collaboration with local universities, research institutes and government agencies on food-safety. In an incident in 2015, weevils and fungus were found in Cerelac baby food.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} commodification {{of women and}} {{biological}} processes, the confusion of scientific evidence with social agendas, and the conflict between marketing and public health. I assert that key actors in the healthcare marketplace - government, businesses, and doctors – have acted to enable weak medical and scientific evidence to be manipulated by ideological and profit-making partisans in a poorly regulated market. I focus on the unique role of the medical profession, which has acted with government {{and the private sector}} to shape the markets in human milk and infant formula. In a striking parallel to the pharmaceutical industry, where physicians’ prescribing practices are essential to raising demand for drugs, doctors also {{play a key role in}} the markets for mothers’ milk. First, physicians increase demand for this commodity - human milk - by identifying it as valuable, and then prescribe it to their patients as a cure for a medical problem. My claim is that this unacknowledged commodification of mothers’ milk perpetuates a traditional view of women and their role in the labor force, reinforces racial and class stereotypes about who is a good mother, strengthens the authority of the medical profession, and garners enormous profits for entrepreneurs in the human milk and infant formula markets. This commodification also distorts the decisions that new mothers and their partners make about breast feeding, formula feeding, or donating milk to a third party, and raises public health concerns about infants who may be at risk of harm from contaminated or <b>adulterated</b> human <b>milk.</b> The paper has four parts. The first part examines the history of breastfeeding and the deeply conflicted role of physicians in simultaneously promoting and discouraging breastfeeding. Both professional pediatrics and the federal government have been actively involved in the marketing breastfeeding as normative behavior. The second part of my paper addresses the markets in human milk and infant formula. The markets in human milk include both a not-for-profit market encompassing milk banks and informal milk-sharing agreements arranged online and a for-profit market that includes wet nurses and a corporation that takes donated milk and manufactures it for sale to hospitals for $ 184 an ounce. Women who donate milk to this for-profit corporation are apparently unaware of the profits made by the corporation when their milk is sold. The market for infant formula – the “next best thing” to mother’s milk – is supported by the medical profession and the government through the Women’s Infant and Children’s Nutrition (WIC) Program. The monopsony power of the WIC program has led to increased formula prices for all consumers. The third part of my paper connects the commodification of breastfeeding and the markets in human milk and infant formula. Here I draw on the work of pro-commodification scholars who suggest that incorporating market-based analysis can actually protect vulnerable populations, including women. My paper proposes a limited market solution in which women will be able to sell or donate their milk, under regulations which protect both women and their children. I conclude with recommendations for changes in the law, the marketplace, and the health care system to promote the autonomy of American women and protect their own and their children’s health...|$|R
