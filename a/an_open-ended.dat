5|$|Metroid Prime 2: Echoes is an action-adventure game {{in which}} the player {{controls}} the protagonist Samus Aran from a first-person perspective, and it takes place in <b>an</b> <b>open-ended</b> world with interconnected regions. Gameplay revolves around solving puzzles to uncover secrets, platform jumping, and shooting enemies. Progress through the game requires both dimensions to be explored, using power-ups that Samus acquires over time. Equipment players collect include the Screw Attack, which allows Samus to somersault in midair and off certain surfaces, and new beam weapons that have limited ammunition.|$|E

5|$|The V-scale, which {{originated}} in the United States, is <b>an</b> <b>open-ended</b> rating system with higher numbers indicating {{a higher degree of}} difficulty. The V1 rating indicates that a problem can be completed by a novice climber in good physical condition after several attempts. The scale begins at V0, and as of 2013, the highest V rating that has been assigned to a bouldering problem is V17. Some climbing gyms also use a VB grade to indicate beginner problems.|$|E
5|$|Adventure is a {{video game}} for the Atari 2600 video game console, {{released}} in late –. In the game, the player controls a square avatar whose quest is to explore <b>an</b> <b>open-ended</b> environment to find a magical chalice {{and return it to}} the golden castle. The game world is populated by roaming enemies: three dragons that can eat the avatar and a bat that randomly steals and hides items around the game world. Adventure introduced a number of innovative game elements to console games, including a playing area that spanned several different screens and enemies that continued to move even when not displayed on the screen.|$|E
5|$|Fragile Allegiance is <b>an</b> <b>open-ended</b> 4X {{real-time}} strategy (RTS) {{game from}} Gremlin Interactive, released in 1996 for MS-DOS and Windows 95. The game begins on May 25, 2496 as the player begins their employment with TetraCorp (a large interstellar megacorporation) who {{have set up}} a new asteroid mining franchise operation in the Fragmented Sectors. There are six alien races competing with Tetracorp for these resources. Beginning with one building and one million credits, the player is tasked with building up a successful mining operation to sell as much ore as possible to the Federation. Diplomacy is crucial to {{the success or failure of}} this franchise operation as the players colonies begin to encroach on one another.|$|E

5|$|It had {{now become}} clear to President Johnson that McNamara {{had become a}} {{liability}} to the administration. In February 1968, McNamara resigned his position {{and was replaced by}} Clark Clifford, who was chosen because of his personal friendship with Johnson and his previous opposition to McNamara's suggestions that the number of troops in the South Vietnam be stabilized and that Rolling Thunder be ended. McNamara's position, however was almost immediately taken up by Secretary of State Dean Rusk, (until then an ardent advocate of the bombing campaign). Rusk proposed limiting the campaign to the panhandle of North Vietnam without preconditions and awaiting Hanoi's reaction. Within months Clifford too began to adopt the views of the man he had replaced, gradually becoming convinced that the U.S. had to withdraw from <b>an</b> <b>open-ended</b> commitment to the war.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completion}} of each puzzle, the player's performance is compared on a leaderboard {{based on the}} number of instructions placed in their reactors, the number of cycles it took to meet the quota, and the number of reactors required to meet the solution. The player also has an option to upload videos of their solution to YouTube. The player, once having cleared a puzzle, can return to previous puzzles to try to improve their solution by reducing the number of instructions, cycles taken, or reactors used. SpaceChem supports downloadable content created by the developers themselves, and user-submitted puzzles through its ResearchNet service. A later addition included <b>an</b> <b>open-ended</b> sandbox mode where players could simply explore the game's capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest II {{is noted}} for greatly {{expanding}} upon the gameplay {{of the previous}} game, Dragon Quest. The game {{is the first in}} the series to feature multiple heroes and enemies in a battle, as well as a sailing ship. It also allowed the player to land the ship anywhere, making it possible to explore the entire game world in <b>an</b> <b>open-ended</b> manner. It included other new gameplay features such as weapons which cast spells when used in battles. Compared with its predecessor, Dragon Warrior II offers a wider array of spells and items and a much larger world. The game also expanded the inventory management system of its predecessor by giving each character an individual inventory that holds up to eight items, placing a greater emphasis on conservative item management between the characters. Dragon Quest II: Luminaries of the Legendary Line was also the first Dragon Quest game to include a game of chance (played with Lottery Tickets that the player finds), and was also the first Dragon Quest game to use multiple key types and to include travel doors (warp gates).|$|E

5|$|Goat Simulator is <b>an</b> <b>open-ended</b> third-person {{perspective}} game {{in which}} the player controls a goat. The player is free to explore the game's world, a suburban setting, as a goat, and jump, run, bash things, and lick objects. Licking objects attaches the goat's tongue to the object and lets the player drag the object around until they let go. At any time, the player can let the goat drop into a ragdoll model, allowing the game's physics to take over, and another control makes the game run in slow-motion. A number of environmental features allow the player to manipulate the goat into stunts such as bouncing off trampolines or launching the goat into the air through large fans. The game features a scoring system similar to skateboarding games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, whereby doing tricks or other actions earns points, while chaining such tricks together in sequence helps build a multiplier that applies to the total score of the tricks done in the sequence. Various in-game goals, such as achieving a certain height, completing flips, or destroying certain objects, are given to the player, but the player {{is not required to}} follow these instructions.|$|E
5|$|In Native American mythology, the bobcat {{is often}} twinned with {{the figure of}} the coyote in a theme of duality. Lynx and coyote are {{associated}} with the fog and wind, respectively—two elements representing opposites in Native American folklore. This basic story, in many variations, is found in the native cultures of North America (with parallels in South America), but they diverge in the telling. One version, which appears in the Nez Perce folklore for instance, depicts lynx and coyote as opposed, antithetical beings. However, another version depicts them with equality and identicality. Claude Lévi-Strauss argues the former concept, that of twins representing opposites, is an inherent theme in New World mythologies, but they are not equally balanced figures, representing <b>an</b> <b>open-ended</b> dualism rather than the symmetric duality of Old World cultures. The latter notion then, Lévi-Strauss suggests, is the result of regular contact between Europeans and native cultures. Additionally, the version found in the Nez Perce story is of much greater complexity, while the version of equality seems to have lost the tale's original meaning.|$|E
5|$|While the {{original}} touring cast intended {{to play a}} limited engagement from April 29 to June 12, 2005 at the Oriental Theatre in Chicago, producers decided to extend it to <b>an</b> <b>open-ended</b> run, making it the first non-Broadway sit-down production of Wicked. Opening at the same Chicago theatre {{the day after the}} touring production had finished, {{the original}} Chicago cast included Ana Gasteyer as Elphaba, Kate Reinders as Glinda, Rondi Reed as Madame Morrible, Kristoffer Cusick as Fiyero, Telly Leung as Boq, Heidi Kettenring as Nessarose and Gene Weygandt as the Wizard. The production closed on January 25, 2009, after over 1,500 performances. The touring production returned to Chicago for a special engagement at the Cadillac Palace Theatre from December 1, 2010 to January 23, 2011. In celebration of the musical's 10th anniversary, the tour played an eight-week return engagement, returning to the Oriental Theatre, from October 30 through December 21, 2013.|$|E
