5|$|After the Muslim {{conquest of}} Persia, Zoroastrians were given dhimmi status and {{subjected}} to persecutions; discrimination <b>and</b> <b>harassment</b> began {{in the form of}} sparse violence.

40|$|A 1988 and 1995 study {{conducted}} within the New South Wales Police (NSWP) found that sex discrimination <b>and</b> sexual <b>harassment</b> was both rife and under reported. This {{is a significant}} issue as sex discrimination <b>and</b> sexual <b>harassment</b> can lead to stress, absenteeism, high staff turnover, litigation and poor public image. Since these studies were completed the NSWP has implemented the NSWP Gender Based <b>and</b> Sexual <b>Harassment</b> Policy <b>and</b> the NSWP Internal Grievance Procedures. As no research within the NSWP examining sex discrimination <b>and</b> sexual <b>harassment</b> has been conducted in the NSWP since the implementation of these policies, a knowledge gap exists and {{the current rate of}} sex discrimination <b>and</b> sexual <b>harassment</b> in the NSWP is not known. This paper suggests that the implemented policies would have had little impact upon the rate of sex discrimination <b>and</b> sexual <b>harassment,</b> as the policies have failed to address likely contributing factors such as the masculinised police culture, resistance to policewomen and the gender imbalance...|$|R
5|$|Depression Quest {{was praised}} by critics for its {{portrayal}} {{of depression and}} its educational value. The game was noted for diverging from mainstream uses of video games as a medium.

False allegations that the game had received a positive review from a journalist {{in a relationship with}} Quinn triggered the Gamergate controversy.|$|E
5|$|Persecution of Zoroastrians is the {{religious}} persecution inflicted upon {{the followers of}} the Zoroastrian faith. The persecution of Zoroastrians occurred throughout the religion's history.

Zoroastrians living under Muslim rule were required to pay a tax called Jizya.|$|E
5|$|Argentina was {{the first}} Latin American country with a gay rights group, Nuestro Mundo (NM, or Our World), created in 1969. Six mostly secret {{organizations}} concentrating on gay or lesbian issues were founded around this time, but persecution <b>and</b> <b>harassment</b> were continuous and grew worse with the dictatorship of Jorge Rafael Videla in 1976, when all groups were dissolved in the Dirty War. Lesbian rights groups have gradually formed since 1986 to build a cohesive community that works to overcome philosophical differences with heterosexual women.|$|E

5|$|Brown was a Queensland {{selector}} from 1950–51 to 1959–60, and an Australian selector in 1952–53 after defeating New South Wales' Chappie Dwyer in an election. He was {{the first}} Queenslander in 23 years {{to serve as a}} national selector. His brief tenure as a national selector was marked by abuse <b>and</b> <b>harassment</b> from parochial Queenslanders, upset that he did not include his fellow statesmen in the Test team. Brown's sports store was vandalised and he resigned as a selector within a year. In 1992, Brown was elected a life member of the Queensland Cricket Association, and in 2000 was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for his services to cricket.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the California {{sea lion}} is {{protected}} {{on the federal}} Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), passed in 1972, which outlaws hunting, killing, capture, <b>and</b> <b>harassment</b> of the animal.

Applications have been granted for removal of several individual sea lions at Ballard Locks and at the Bonneville Dam, where up to 92 sea lions can be killed each year for a 5-year period.|$|E
5|$|King {{believed}} that organized, nonviolent {{protest against the}} system of southern segregation known as Jim Crow laws would lead to extensive {{media coverage of the}} struggle for black equality and voting rights. Journalistic accounts and televised footage of the daily deprivation and indignities suffered by Southern blacks, and of segregationist violence <b>and</b> <b>harassment</b> of civil rights workers and marchers, produced a wave of sympathetic public opinion that convinced the majority of Americans that the Civil Rights Movement was the most important issue in American politics in the early 1960s.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{studies show}} that {{culturally}} stigmatized groups face more workplace harassments. With changes {{in the political and}} social scenes in America, subtle <b>and</b> daily <b>harassment</b> is more common than blatant <b>and</b> explicit <b>harassment</b> today. A study by Deitch, Barsky, Butz and et al. shows that black Americans face more mistreatment in workplaces than white Americans. The mistreatments <b>and</b> <b>harassments</b> do not explicitly [...] "reference race or discrimination as the cause of the treatment", because overt racism is prohibited in workplaces. However, the statistics show race is [...] "significantly associated with mistreatment" [...] and that black Americans in general report significantly more [...] "minor, pervasive mistreatment and unfairness on the job." [...] The study suggests the discrimination <b>and</b> <b>harassments</b> may intensify for Black Americans in a job with fewer people of the same race, such as [...] "token" [...] Black employee or [...] "solo" [...] employees. In addition, not only Blacks but also Asian Americans, and other minority races all face [...] "a higher rate of homicide than their proportion of the work force would suggest." [...] Of the eighth of the workforce experiencing homicide, more than a fourth of the population is an ethnic minority.|$|R
40|$|Research {{indicates}} that interpersonal discrimination contributes to mental problems among sexual minorities. However, {{little attention has}} been given to subtle discrimination and witnessing discrimination. This study examines the relationship among sexual orientation, experiencing and witnessing hostility (e. g., verbal threats), incivility (e. g., dirty looks), heterosexist harassment (e. g., homophobic names), and moderate/high anxiety and depression symptoms among college students. Results indicated that experiencing hostility, incivility, <b>and</b> heterosexist <b>harassment</b> each partially mediated the relationship between sexual minority status and anxiety. Similar relationships were found for experiencing incivility <b>and</b> heterosexist <b>harassment</b> <b>and</b> depression. Witnessing hostility <b>and</b> heterosexist <b>harassment</b> partially mediated anxiety among sexual minority students...|$|R
40|$|Judges, academics, {{and lawyers}} alike base their legal {{analyses}} of workplace racial harassment {{on the sexual}} harassment model. Legal principles derived from sexual harassment jurisprudence are presumed to be equally appropriate for racial harassment cases. The implicit assumption is that the social harms and public policy goals of racial <b>harassment</b> <b>and</b> sexual <b>harassment</b> are sufficiently similar to justify analogous scrutiny and remedies. Parties to racial harassment cases cite the reasoning and elements of sexual harassment cases without hesitation, as if racial <b>harassment</b> <b>and</b> sexual <b>harassment</b> are behaviorally <b>and</b> legally indistinguishable. This Article, however, questions the assumption {{that there should be}} a monolithic model for discriminatory workplace harassment. In particular, it questions whether the currently dominant sexual harassment model should be used automatically as the paradigm in racial harassment disputes. Part I begins by acknowledging and explaining why the legal community analogizes racial <b>harassment</b> claims <b>and</b> jurisprudence to sexual <b>harassment</b> claims <b>and</b> jurisprudence. Part II posits that this analogy is problematic given the fundamental differences between racial <b>harassment</b> <b>and</b> sexual <b>harassment.</b> While empirical evidence of these differences is currently limited, Part II identifies and discusses two pioneering examples. The first documents important dissimilarities between racial <b>harassment</b> litigation <b>and</b> sexual <b>harassment</b> litigation; the second chronicles the differences between the dynamics and theoretical explanations for racial <b>harassment</b> <b>and</b> sexual <b>harassment</b> in the law firm context. Given the dominance of the sexual <b>harassment</b> model <b>and</b> the presumption of its applicability to other harassment disputes, including racial harassment, it is not surprising that comparatively little research and study of racial <b>harassment</b> <b>and</b> other forms of harassment have been done. The discussion and analysis here contributes to the research on the topic. Finally, Part III explores the implications of freeing racial harassment from the sexual harassment model...|$|R
5|$|On 11 September 1966, Cambodia {{held its}} first open election. Through {{manipulation}} <b>and</b> <b>harassment</b> (and to Sihanouk's surprise) the conservatives won 75 percent of {{the seats in the}} National Assembly. Lon Nol was chosen by the right as prime minister and, as his deputy, they named Prince Sirik Matak; an ultraconservative member of the Sisowath branch of the royal clan and long-time enemy of Sihanouk. In addition to these developments and the clash of interests among Phnom Penh's politicized elite, social tensions created a favorable environment for the growth of a domestic communist insurgency in the rural areas.|$|E
5|$|The Church of Scientology {{sought an}} {{injunction}} and {{a restraining order}} to prevent Anonymous from protesting on March 15, 2008, citing threats allegedly made by Anonymous. Both the injunction and the restraining order were denied. On March 31, 2008, Radar Online reported that representatives of law firms delivered legal letters to suspected Anons, often at their homes. The Church filed complaints of trespassing and criminal harassment against Boston organizer Gregg Housh, who was charged with disturbing an assembly of worship, disturbing the peace, <b>and</b> <b>harassment.</b> The District Attorney's office dropped the harassment charge, and Judge Thomas Horgan issued a continuance without finding for the remaining charges.|$|E
5|$|The inner German border {{was never}} entirely sealed {{in the fashion}} of {{the border between the}} two Koreas and could be crossed in either {{direction}} throughout the Cold War. The post-war agreements on the governance of Berlin specified that the Western Allies were to have access to the city via defined air, road, rail and river corridors. This was mostly respected by the Soviets and East Germans, albeit with periodic interruptions <b>and</b> <b>harassment</b> of travellers. Even during the Berlin Blockade of 1948, supplies could be brought in by air– the famous Berlin Airlift. Before and after the blockade, Western civilian and military trains, road traffic and barges routinely passed through East Germany en route to Berlin.|$|E

5|$|Though Roshan {{maintained}} that they parted amicably, the media {{reported that the}} split was due to infidelity on his part, linking him with several actresses, most notably his Krrish 3 co-star Kangana Ranaut. Roshan denied {{having an affair with}} the actress, and filed a lawsuit against her in 2016 accusing her of cyber stalking <b>and</b> <b>harassment.</b> Denying the charges, Ranaut filed a counter-charge against Roshan, claiming that his lawsuit was an attempt to cover-up their affair for the benefit of his divorce proceedings.

5|$|Western jackdaws {{practice}} active food sharing– {{where the}} initiative {{for the transfer}} lies with the donor– {{with a number of}} individuals, regardless of sex or kinship. They also share more of a preferred food than a less preferred food. The active giving of food by most birds is found mainly in the context of parental care and courtship. Western jackdaws show much higher levels of active giving than has been documented for other species, including chimpanzees. The function of this behaviour is not fully understood, though it {{has been found to be}} detached from nutrition and compatible with hypotheses of mutualism, reciprocity <b>and</b> <b>harassment</b> avoidance. It has also been proposed that food sharing may be motivated by prestige enhancement.|$|E
5|$|Wings for My Flight: The Peregrine Falcons of Chimney Rock is a 1991 book by American {{wildlife}} biologist Marcy Cottrell Houle. Wings for My Flight documents Houle's observations {{of a pair}} of the then-endangered peregrine falcons at Chimney Rock, a prominent rock formation in Colorado, while employed by the Colorado Division of Wildlife in the summer of 1975. To protect the falcons, Houle had to halt a million-dollar project to turn ancient Anasazi ruins in the area into a tourist attraction and faced opposition <b>and</b> <b>harassment</b> by the Chimney Rock community as a result. The community eventually showed concern for Houle, however, after her trailer was broken into and vandalized.|$|E

5|$|Grey-headed {{flying foxes}} {{are exposed to}} several threats, {{including}} loss of foraging and roosting habitat, competition with the black flying fox, and mass die-offs caused by extreme temperature events. When present in urban environments, grey-headed flying foxes are sometimes perceived as a nuisance. Cultivated orchard fruits are also taken, but apparently only at times when other food items are scarce. Because their roosting and foraging habits bring the species into conflict with humans, they suffer from direct killing of animals in orchards <b>and</b> <b>harassment</b> and destruction of roosts. Negative public perception of the species has intensified {{with the discovery of}} three recently emerged zoonotic viruses that are potentially fatal to humans: Hendra virus, Australian bat lyssavirus and Menangle virus. However, only Australian bat lyssavirus is known from two isolated cases to be directly transmissible from bats to humans. No person has ever died from ABLV (Lyssavirus) after having had the ABLV post-exposure vaccine.|$|E
5|$|Stoke {{slipped down}} {{the league in}} an {{extremely}} tight 1937–38 season, and, annoyed by rumours circulating the city of resentment {{in the dressing room}} against him for his England success, Matthews requested a transfer in February; his request was denied. His request became public knowledge, and, disturbed by the attention <b>and</b> <b>harassment</b> he was receiving from Stoke supporters urging him to stay, Matthews decided to take a few days off from the club to relax in Blackpool. Finding no peace there either, Stoke chairman Albert Booth told Matthews he {{would not be allowed to}} leave the club, and 3,000 City supporters organized a meeting to make their feelings known – they too demanded that he stay. Touched by their strength of feeling and worn out by the attention he was receiving, Matthews agreed to stay. Despite playing regularly for the national side, Matthews put in 38 games for Stoke in 1938–39, helping them to a seventh-place finish – there would not be another full season of Football League action until 1946.|$|E
5|$|The Boston Massacre, {{known as}} the Incident on King Street by the British, was an {{incident}} on March 5, 1770, in which British Army soldiers shot and killed people while under attack by a mob. The incident was heavily publicized by leading Patriots, such as Paul Revere and Samuel Adams, to encourage rebellion against the British authorities. British troops had been stationed in Boston, capital of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, since 1768 {{in order to protect}} and support crown-appointed colonial officials attempting to enforce unpopular Parliamentary legislation. Amid ongoing tense relations between the population and the soldiers, a mob formed around a British sentry, who was subjected to verbal abuse <b>and</b> <b>harassment.</b> He was eventually supported by eight additional soldiers, who were subjected to verbal threats and repeatedly hit by clubs, stones and snowballs. They fired into the crowd, without orders, instantly killing three people and wounding others. Two more people died later of wounds sustained in the incident.|$|E
