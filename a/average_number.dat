40|$|We {{calculate}} the <b>averaged</b> <b>number</b> ν of the lightest supersymmetric particles (LSPs) {{in a shower}} from the decay of superheavy particle X by generalized DGLAP equations. If the primary decayed particles have color charges and the virtuality is around 10 ^ 13 - 10 ^ 14 GeV, the <b>averaged</b> <b>number</b> of the LSPs can become O(100). As the result, the upper limit {{of the mass of}} the superheavy particle, whose decay can produce the observed abundance of the dark matter, can increase from 10 ^ 12 GeV to 10 ^ 14 GeV. Since the typical scale of the inflaton mass of the chaotic inflation is around 10 ^ 13 GeV, the decay of the inflaton can produce the observed dark matter abundance if the reheating temperature is of order 1 GeV. Even for the standard model particles with virtuality Q∼ 10 - 100 TeV, the <b>averaged</b> <b>number</b> of the LSPs becomes O(0. 1) for gluon, and O(0. 01) for Higgs, which strongly constrains the scenario of non-thermal LSP production from the decay of moduli with 10 - 100 TeV mass.

If the eggs are lost early in the nesting season, the female usually lays another clutch, although this is extremely rare in the Arctic due to the short summer season. Generally three to four eggs, but sometimes as few as one or as many as five, are laid in the scrape. The eggs are white to buff with red or brown markings. They are incubated for 29 to 33 days, mainly by the female, with the male also helping with the incubation of the eggs during the day, but only the female incubating them at night. The <b>average</b> <b>number</b> of young found in nests is 2.5, and the <b>average</b> <b>number</b> that fledge is about 1.5, due to the occasional production of infertile eggs and various natural losses of nestlings.|$|E
