500|$|Winfrey {{used her}} status as both a celebrity and a media {{personality}} to give the film what was described by Ben Child of The Guardian, as a [...] "high-profile promotional push." [...] At a press conference Winfrey announced her intention to lead a promotional campaign on behalf of Precious along with her other various platforms, hoping {{to be able to}} [...] "bring in different audiences" [...] by promoting the film on her show, in her magazine and on her satellite-radio channel. Katie Walmsley of CNN remarked, based on the film's positive reception at the Toronto Film Festival, that the film [...] "at the very least, the [...] award will guarantee [...] "Precious" [...] substantial distribution, as well as exposure for two-time director Daniels." [...] The trailer for Precious was shown during previews of the film's producer Perry's film I Can Do Bad <b>All</b> <b>By</b> <b>Myself</b> in September 2009.|$|E
500|$|The {{opening night}} of the tour {{received}} rave reviews from critics. Hermione Hoby of The Guardian awarded the concert 5 stars, stating [...] "She sounds, moves and looks like a goddess {{and most of us}} 'bow down' accordingly". Kelli Kennedy writing for the Associated Press noted that Beyoncé [...] "slays at tour opening" [...] and further commented [...] "her commanding performance of [...] "Freedom" [...] served as reminder to the world that she 'breaks chains <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>myself.</b> I'm gonna keep running because a runner don't quit on herself'". Becky Randel of Billboard felt that emotion guided the mood for the evening and stated that [...] "Bey was overcome when the audience knew all the lyrics to her new song, [...] "Hold Up" [...] and she often stopped to smile or nod at her exuberant BeyHive. Writing for Rolling Stone, Kat Bein said Beyoncé was [...] "a prime example of entertainment and a vision of an artist at her apex" [...] and later commented [...] "the show was a visual feast as well as an emotional tour de force, packed with fireworks, confetti, rearranging stage designs and aerial dancers".|$|E

2500|$|The single was {{included}} along with [...] "Unite the World" [...] on the Temptations' ninth regular studio album, Sky's the Limit, {{which included the}} final Temptations recordings to feature Eddie Kendricks. He began working on his solo album <b>All</b> <b>By</b> <b>Myself</b> shortly before officially leaving the group.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{one final}} altercation with Williams and Franklin during {{a run at}} the Copacabana nightclub in November 1970, Kendricks walked off after the first night and didn't return, and it was {{mutually}} decided he would leave the group. While working on his first solo album, Kendricks recorded one last hit single with the Temptations, 1971's [...] "Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)". By the time the record reached #1 on the US pop charts in April 1971, Kendricks had signed a solo deal with Motown's Tamla imprint and was preparing the release of his first solo album, <b>All</b> <b>By</b> <b>Myself.</b> However, many of his problems with Motown would reoccur.|$|E
2500|$|That is not surprising. In a 1995 {{interview}} Wild nominated {{his most}} significant achievement {{to be the}} building of the Culgoora radio-heliograph and providing the world with a unique eye to view and record moving pictures of rapidly changing solar activity. He observed:most scientific discoveries, had they not been made by the originator, would have been made by somebody else within a year or so or even less. To my mind the most significant discoveries or projects are those which would have eluded other researchers for decades or more. … The [...] revealed a whole range of previously unknown phenomena at a wavelength millions of times longer than the wavelength of all other moving pictures ever taken of the sun. Today, nearly three decades later, the instrument has not been duplicated and the results remain unique. In saying this I do not want {{to give the impression that}} I did it <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>myself.</b> I owe much to the CSIRO and the Ford Foundation for providing the resources and to a wonderful bunch of colleagues who built it and made it all work.|$|E

[...] "I am banishing myself from all I love, {{and there is}} a weight on me for life; but, unless {{suspicion}} falls on others, I do not feel bound to make it worse for <b>all</b> <b>by</b> giving <b>myself</b> up.

2500|$|Throughout {{most of the}} 1980s, Bassey {{focused on}} {{charitable}} work and performing occasional concert tours throughout Europe, Australia, and the United States. She had ended her contract with United Artists, whose former record division was now part of EMI, and began what she referred to as [...] "semi-retirement". Bassey recorded an album entitled <b>All</b> <b>by</b> <b>Myself</b> (1982) and made a TV special for Thames Television called A Special Lady with guest Robert Goulet. Around this time she recorded a duet with the French film actor Alain Delon, [...] "Thought I'd Ring You" [...] (1983), which became a hit single in Europe. Bassey was now recording far less often but an album of her most famous songs, I Am What I Am (1984), was recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) conducted by Carl Davis. This {{was followed by a}} single and video to support the London Tourist Board, [...] "There's No Place Like London" [...] (1986), which was co-written by Lynsey de Paul and Gerard Kenny. She recorded an album of James Bond themes, The Bond Collection in 1987, but was apparently unhappy with the results so she declined to release it. (Five years later it was released anyway, Bassey sued in court, and all unsold copies were withdrawn.) Bassey provided vocals for Swiss artists Yello on [...] "The Rhythm Divine" [...] (1987), a song co-written by Scottish singer Billy Mackenzie. An album sung entirely in Spanish, La Mujer was released in 1989. In the latter mid-1980s Bassey had started working with a vocal coach, a former opera singer, and her album Keep the Music Playing (1991) displayed a grand, operatic pop style on several songs (perhaps also influenced by her album with the LSO seven years earlier).|$|E

6000|$|He {{told me how}} he had {{dismissed}} {{his three}} servants, sold their horses, and sent the fellows away to seek their fortunes, and all in a little time, at a town on the road, I know not where. 'And,' says he, 'it cost me some tears <b>all</b> alone <b>by</b> <b>myself,</b> to think how much happier they were than their master, for {{they could go to}} the next gentleman's house to see for a service, whereas,' said he, 'I knew not wither to go, or what to do with myself.' ...|$|R

5000|$|The Odd Trio is a {{solo album}} {{released}} in 2000 by guitar virtuoso Michael Schenker. Schenker himself talks about this album on his website: [...] "This album came about in 2000 when I had {{the urge to}} record an album playing all instruments. I {{thought of it as}} a fun thing to do and decided to disguise myself as different musicians, inventing characters. It was quite an experience, engineering, producing and recording <b>all</b> instruments <b>by</b> <b>myself</b> in my own studio. Even my brother Rudolf did not recognized me as 'Kathy the drummer' and asked, who is this nice looking chick? Amazingly, this album became a favourite to many of my fans".|$|R

6000|$|... "Never mind. Go on. I {{know you}} think that I have brought it <b>all</b> on <b>myself</b> <b>by</b> my own wickedness. Pay this man the money, and then if {{anything}} be said about it, explain {{that it was my}} fault, and say that you paid the money because I had done wrong." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to the {{producer}} of the track Teddy Riley:“This was mostly from a sample CD that I just put together myself, {{and it kind of}} reminded me of the James Brown sound. I could feel it. I thought I'd bring a shadow of some of the greatness of the James Brown production sound to this. I made the sample CD myself - that was me playing instruments, then looping them up and having them lying around for potential projects. Back then I just had them lying around and I hadn't used them… But I really wanted to use them! Throughout the album I was drawing off a lot of CDs I had hanging around, <b>all</b> played <b>by</b> <b>myself.</b> I'm a multi-instrumentalist." ...|$|R
60|$|But, as I have said, I {{decided to}} catch {{one of the}} others and break it into harness. One is enough. Once {{familiar}} with its assortment of tails, you are immune; after that, no regular verb can conceal its specialty from you and make you think it is working the past or the future or the conditional or the unconditional when it is engaged in some other line of business--its tail will give it away. I found out <b>all</b> these things <b>by</b> <b>myself,</b> without a teacher.|$|R

60|$|I did so, and did {{so every}} morning of my imprisonment, which lasted five days. If I could have seen my mother alone, I should have gone {{down on my knees}} to her and besought her forgiveness; but I saw no one, Miss Murdstone excepted, during the whole time--except at evening prayers in the parlour; to which I was escorted by Miss Murdstone after {{everybody}} else was placed; where I was stationed, a young outlaw, <b>all</b> alone <b>by</b> <b>myself</b> near the door; and whence I was solemnly conducted by my jailer, before any one arose from the devotional posture. I only observed that my mother was as far off from me as she could be, and kept her face another way so that I never saw it; and that Mr. Murdstone's hand was bound up in a large linen wrapper.|$|R

I will not revile you like a Delaware or a Mohican; for my gifts are a white man's gifts, and not an Indian's; and boasting in battle is no part of a Christian warrior; but I may say here, <b>all</b> alone <b>by</b> <b>myself,</b> that you are little better than so many men from the town shooting at robins in the orchards. That was well meant," [...] throwing back his head, as a rifle bullet cut a lock of hair from his temple; [...] "but the lead that misses by an inch is as useless as the lead that never quits the barrel.

60|$|Sterling's days, {{during this}} time as always, were full of occupation, cheerfully {{interesting}} to himself and others; though, the wrecks of theology so encumbering him, little fruit {{on the positive side}} could come of these labors. On the negative side they were productive; and there also, so much of encumbrance requiring removal, before fruit could grow, there was plenty of labor needed. He looked happy as well as busy; roamed extensively among his friends, and loved to have them about him,--chiefly old Cambridge comrades now settling into occupations in the world;--and was felt <b>by</b> <b>all</b> friends, <b>by</b> <b>myself</b> as <b>by</b> few, to be a welcome illumination in the dim whirl of things. A man of altogether social and human ways; his address everywhere pleasant and enlivening. A certain smile of thin but genuine laughter, we might say, hung gracefully over all he said and did;--expressing gracefully, according to the model of this epoch, the stoical pococurantism which is required of the cultivated Englishman. Such laughter in him was not deep, but neither was it false (as lamentably happens often); and the cheerfulness it went to symbolize was hearty and beautiful,--visible in the silent unsymbolized state in a still gracefuler fashion.|$|R
40|$|The {{observations}} here recorded {{are based}} on the examination of more than 5, 000 specimens, <b>all</b> collected <b>by</b> <b>myself</b> chiefly in the southern and central parts of Tasmania. If the metamorphic theory is correct, {{it stands to reason that}} there must be a considerable number of varieties of cherty rocks. A metamorphosed sandstone must be considerably different from a rock whose origin is a shale. But not only are the primary rocks widely different in chemical composition, but each kind, whether sandstone, shale, or anything else, varies considerably. Whenever a collection of native stone implements is made in the island, and such collection be sorted afterwards, it will be found that two large groups can be distinguished at once: Volcanic rocks and Metamorphosed sedimentary rock of a highly siliceous nature. The above investigation has conclusively proved that there is a great variety of rocks used in the manufacture of the tronatta. This variety of substances stands in a sharp contrast to the monotony of the material used in the manufacture of the European implements. Variety of material and monotony of the same are the chief distinguishing feature of an otherwise undistinguisiiable collection of eolithes and archaeolithes from Tasmanian and Europe...|$|R
