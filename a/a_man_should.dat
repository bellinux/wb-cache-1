With other Pythons already aware of his sexual orientation, Idle jokingly replied that they had found the perpetrator and killed him. Both Sherlock and Tomiczek remained a constant in Chapman's life. In the mid-1980s, having resettled in Britain, the three moved to Maidstone, Kent.|$|E

He also wrote that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>should</b> not orgasm before the woman, as it injects selfishness into the act of love making. Other thoughts on sex include that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>should</b> not orgasm with the woman positioned above him, as she is then drawing energies into herself from below, instead of above.

25|$|Rabbinic courts could {{compel the}} husband {{to make this}} provision, if he fails to do so voluntarily.

25|$|The FLDS Church {{teaches the}} {{doctrine}} of plural marriage, which states that a man having multiple wives is ordained of and a commandment by God; the doctrine requires it {{in order for a}} man to receive the highest form of salvation. It is generally believed in the church that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>should</b> have a minimum of three wives to fulfill this requirement. Connected with this doctrine is patriarchal doctrine, the belief that wives are required to be subordinate to their husbands.|$|E

25|$|As {{decreases}} in job security and wages for males have negatively impacted {{the ability of}} the sole male-breadwinner family model, there is now increasing pressure for women to work outside the home in a dual-earner family model. The percentage of young women who believed that <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>should</b> work outside a home and that women should work inside dropped from 41.6% in 1997 to 27.8% in 2008, while for men the rate went from 40.7% to 34.3% respectively. Similarly, the proportion of young women who expected to work until retirement rose from 15.3% in 1987 to 24.7% in 2010, while the proportion of men who expected their wives to do so rose from 10.5% to 32.7% in the same time period. The increasing acceptance of young Japanese adults of the dual-earner model has resulted in an increase of dual-earner young households from 32.4% in 2000 to 42.8% in 2009. Women are also delaying or avoiding marriage altogether. The mean age of first marriage rose from 24.2 in 1970 to 28.8 in 2010, while the proportion of women aged 25–29 who have not married increased from 18.1% in 1970 to 60.3% in 2010. The education levels of young women are also drastically increasing, at a rate higher than their male counterparts. 45.2% of women in 2010 progressed to university from high school, a dramatic increase from 15.2% in 1990. These changes in Japanese society have narrowed the wage gap between men and women, as wages of female 25–29 years old have reached 88% of their male counterparts in 2007, as opposed to 76% in 1981. However, a large part of this reduction in the wage gap is due to the stagnation of male wages, which was at the same levels in 2007 as in 1991.|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} {{praise from}} critics with The Moving Picture World stating, [...] " [...] picture which touches {{the heart and}} arouses the strongest emotions.

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Dear Future Husband" [...] {{deals with}} {{subjects}} of chivalry and marriage. It {{is based on}} a list of qualities <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>should</b> have if he wants to marry Trainor, or call her his girlfriend. Christina Lee of Idolator opined that the lyrics, [...] "You got that 9-to-5, but baby, so do I / so don't be thinking I'll be home making apple pies" [...] and Trainor's [...] "slight twang" [...] on the song recalled the works of American singer Wanda Jackson. Rolling Stone writer Jon Dolan opined that the song's lyrical content describes [...] "marriage as a contract between equals who work and don't cook," [...] and deemed it a [...] "YA dream that's no pastel-colored fantasy". The track's melody was likened to those of 1961 songs [...] "Runaround Sue" [...] by Dion and [...] "Quarter to Three" [...] by Gary U.S. Bonds. [...] "Dear Future Husband" [...] is set in the time signature of common time, with a tempo of 159 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of D♭ major, with a key change to D major, with Trainor's vocals spanning the tonal nodes of A3 to A5. The song follows a basic sequence of D–Bm–G–A as its chord progression. [...] "Dear Future Husband" [...] was recorded at The Carriage House in Nolensville, Tennessee. Trainor's vocals were recorded by Kadish, who was also responsible for the track's mixing, programming and engineering. The song's instrumentation includes electric guitar, bass, synthesizer and acoustic guitar by Kadish; and piano and organ by David Baron; and baritone and tenor saxophone by Jim Hoke. The song was mastered by David Kutch at The Mastering Palace, New York City, New York.|$|E

[...] The 1987 tribute song [...] "Alex Chilton", co-written by three members of the Replacements, was released as a single from the album Pleased to Meet Me and contains the lyric [...] "I never travel far without a little Big Star." [...] "I'm In Love With A Girl" [...] from Radio City features in the soundtrack of the 2009 film Adventureland. In 1998, an ad hoc, shortened version of #1 Records [...] "In the Street" [...] (recorded by Todd Griffin) was used as the theme song for the sitcom That '70s Show, and in 1999, a new version titled [...] "That '70s Song (In the Street)" [...] was recorded by Cheap Trick also specifically for the show. [...] "That '70s Song" [...] and Big Star's own [...] "September Gurls" [...] are included on the 1999 album That '70s Album (Rockin') released by the television program's producers. The 2006 tribute album Big Star, Small World includes Big Star covers by the Posies, Teenage Fanclub, Gin Blossoms, Wilco, the Afghan Whigs, and Whiskeytown, among others.
