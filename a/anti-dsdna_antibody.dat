We have found that ApoE−/− mice showed splenomegaly, higher titers of serum anti-nuclear {{antibody}} (ANA) and <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibody</b> compared with C 57 B 6 /L (B 6) mice. However, whether ApoE−/− mice show autoimmune injury remains unclear. Methods and resultsSix females and six males in each group, ApoE−/−, Fas−/− and B 6 mice, were used in this study. The titers of serum ANA, <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibody</b> and creatinine and urine protein were measured by ELISA after 4 months of high-fat diet. The spleen weight and the glomerular area were determined. The expressions of IgG, C 3 and macrophage in kidney and atherosclerotic plaque were detected by immunostaining followed by morphometric analysis. Similar to the characteristics of Fas−/− mice, a model of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), ApoE−/− mice, especially female, displayed significant increases of spleen weight and glomerular area when compared to B 6 mice. Also, elevated titers of serum ANA, <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibody</b> and creatinine and urine protein.

40|$|Objectives. Toll-like {{receptor}} 9 (TLR 9) is a pattern-associated receptor {{functioning in}} innate immunity {{that may be}} involved in the recognition of self-antigens and the production of pathogenic auto-antibodies. Therefore, we examined the expression of TLR 9 in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) to determine whether TLR 9 is involved in the production of pathogenic auto-antibodies. Methods. B cells were collected from patients with active SLE, and subjected to analysis of the TLR 9 molecule using flow cytometry fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and TLR 9 mRNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. SLE B cells were stimulated with CpG-ODN, and subsequent cytokine and <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibody</b> production was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results. The expression and mRNA level of TLR 9 on B cells was up-regulated in SLE patients, and SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) and CH 50 were correlated with TLR 9 expression on CD 20 þ B cells. Moreover, TLR 9 –CpG interaction enhanced the production of <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibody</b> and IL- 10. Conclusions. The present study demonstrated that higher expression of TLR 9 on peripheral blood B cells from patients with active SLE was significantly correlated with CH 50 and SLEDAI to TLR 9, and induced the production of <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibody</b> and IL- 10 by TLR 9 –CpG ligation.

40|$|Lupus nephritis is {{a severe}} organ manifestation of {{systemic}} lupus erythematosus (SLE), and {{is characterized by the}} production of anti-dsDNA antibodies. It is an important cause of renal failure. The mechanism through which anti-dsDNA antibodies bind to tissues and mediate kidney injury remains to be fully elucidated. Emerging evidence suggests that anti-dsDNA antibodies can bind to cells and extracellular antigens directly through cross-reactivity, independent of bridging chromatin material. Mesangial cells {{play an important role in}} normal kidney structure and functions, and its pathophysiology. Mesangial abnormalities in lupus nephritis precede more severe injuries such as lesions in the glomerular capillary loop. We previously demonstrated that the binding of human anti-dsDNA antibodies to mesangial cells (HMC) correlated with disease activity and induced inflammatory as well as fibrotic pathways. The aim of this project is to identify the cross-reactive antigen(s) on the mesangial cell surface that mediates <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibody</b> binding and the alterations in cell functions that result from this interaction. HMC plasma membrane proteins were purified. Using proteomic and biochemical approaches, we identified annexin II as the predominant cross-reactive antigen on the HMC surface that mediated human polyclonal <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibody</b> binding. Following this interaction, anti-dsDNA antibodies were internalized in a time- and temperature-dependent manner, and translocated to both the cytoplasm and nucleus within 30 min. This resulted in induction of annexin II synthesis, IL- 6 secretion and cell proliferation, which was mediated through the activation of p 38 MAPK, JNK and AKT. The binding activity to annexin II in the serum immunoglobulin fraction correlated with the titre of <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibody.</b> Binding activity of anti-dsDNA antibodies to annexin II correlated with clinical disease activity and circulating <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibody</b> levels. These correlations were more prominent in male patients with lupus nephritis. Glomerular annexin II expression was increased in patients with active lupus nephritis and co-localized with IgG and C 3 deposition. Gene silencing of annexin II in HMC reduced <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibody</b> binding, which was accompanied by reduced IL- 6 secretion and cell proliferation. Using female NZB/W F 1 mice, an established murine model of lupus nephritis, we demonstrated that intra-glomerular annexin II expression increased with disease progression and was accompanied by an increase in the expression of p 11, its cellular protein ligand. Our data suggest that annexin II may exist in the kidney as a heterotetramer and is involved in disease pathogenesis. At the ultrastructural level, annexin II was detected in the mesangial matrix, amongst electron dense deposits in the glomerular basement membrane, on the foot processes in podocytes and within the Bowman’s capsule. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that annexin II is the major cell surface antigen on HMC that mediates the cross-reactive binding of human anti-DNA antibodies. Through this interaction, cellular processes are triggered that contribute to the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis. published_or_final_versionMedicineDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|Objective: An Italian {{multicentre}} study was promoted {{in order to}} assess the accuracy of four anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody assays for SLE diagnosis and monitoring. Methods: Two hundred and twenty-three patients with established SLE according to ACR classification criteria were enrolled from 9 centres. They included 59 patients at first evaluation (disease duration < 12 months) and 164 with longer disease duration (median disease duration 120 months). The sera from 55 healthy subjects and 161 patients with rheumatic, infectious or neoplastic diseases were tested as controls. SLE activity was measured by ECLAM score. Anti-dsDNA antibodies were detected in serum by means of FarrzymeTM assay, fluoroenzymeimmunoassay (EliATM), Crithidia luciliae indirect immunofluorescence (CLIFT) or Farr radioimmunoassay (Farr). Cut-off values of quantitative assays were chosen by ROC curves analysis. Statistics were conducted by SPSS software package. Results: Sensitivity for SLE diagnosis ranged between 66 % with Farrzyme to 95 % with Farr, with about 90 % specificity for all the methods tested. Farrzyme assay was more specific than the others towards patients with non-SLE connective tissue disease. The four methods were moderately concordant and correlated among them, all showing a positive association with active disease, renal or haematologic involvement, and a negative association with central nervous system disease. Whatever the assay used, <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibody</b> levels correlated with disease activity with r correlation coefficients ranging from 0. 336 to 0. 425 (p< 0. 0001).

Secondary objectives included evaluation {{of the effect of}} abetimus on C 3 levels, anti-double-stranded DNA (<b>anti-dsDNA)</b> <b>antibody</b> levels, use of high-dose corticosteroids and/or cyclophosphamide, and major systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) flare. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled study of treatment with abetimus at 100 mg/week for up to 22 months in SLE patients. Three hundred seventeen patients with a history of renal flare and anti-dsDNA levels > 15 IU/ml were randomized to a treatment group (158 abetimus, 159 placebo); 298 (94 %) were enrolled in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population (145 abetimus, 153 placebo), based on the presence of high-affinity antibodies for the oligonucleotide epitope of abetimus at baseline screening. RESULTS: Abetimus did not significantly prolong time to renal flare, time to initiation of high-dose corticosteroid and/or cyclophosphamide treatment, or time to major SLE flare. However, there were 25 % fewer renal flares in the abetimus group compared with the placebo group (17 of 145 abetimus-treated patients [12 %] versus 24 of 153 placebo-treated patients [16 %]).

The diagnostic specificity of the four ELISAs was lower (71 % to 78 %). In contrast, the diagnostic sensitivity of 3 out of 4 ELISAs was comparable or higher than that of Farr-RIA. The Farrzyme ELISA had slightly greater diagnostic specificity (78 %), but was less sensitive (70 %) than other ELISAs. <b>Anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibody</b> detection by Farrzyme ELISA, Farr-RIA and CLIF was associated with renal involvement and low levels of complement components C 3 and C 4.

These results confirm that there are notable quality differences between the studied antidsDNA antibody assays. CLIF and Farr-RIA are particularly valuable for SLE diagnosis. With CLIF and Farr-RIA, positive <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibody</b> results were obtained almost exclusively in SLE patients. Consequently, positive <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibody</b> results by the ELISA tests most commonly used in routine laboratories should be confirmed by CLIF and/or Farr-RIA to establish the definitive diagnosis of SLE.

Isoelectric focusing showed that cationic anti-dsDNA populations were present predominantly in the high-affinity fraction during active nephritis and in the low-affinity fraction during inactive nephritis. Idiotypic analysis by ELISA and Western blotting showed that the high-affinity cationic anti-DNA antibodies during active nephritis were idiotypically different from their low-affinity counterparts during inactive nephritis. The differences in binding affinity and idiotypy of the cationic <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibodies</b> suggest that certain serum IgG <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibodies</b> with both cationic charge and high affinity {{may be associated with}} active nephritis...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the characteristics of}} Chinese SLE patients by analyzing the association between specific autoantibodies and clinical manifestations of 2104 SLE patients from registry data of CSTAR cohort. Significant (P< 0. 05) associations were found between anti-Sm antibody, anti-rRNP antibody, and malar rash; between anti-RNP antibody, anti-SSA antibody, and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); between anti-SSB antibody and hematologic involvement; and between <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibody</b> and nephropathy. APL antibody was associated with hematologic involvement, interstitial lung disease, and a lower prevalence of oral ulcerations (P< 0. 05). Associations were also found between <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibody</b> and a lower prevalence of photosensitivity, and between anti-SSA antibody and a lower prevalence of nephropathy (P< 0. 05). Most of these findings were consistent with other studies in the literature but {{this study is the}} first report on the association between anti-SSA and a lower prevalence of nephropathy. The correlations of specific autoantibodies and clinical manifestations could provide clues for physicians to predict organ damages in SLE patients. We suggest that a thorough screening of autoantibodies should be carried out when the diagnosis of SLE is established, and repeated echocardiography annually in SLE patients with anti-RNP or anti-SSA antibody should be performed...|$|E
40|$|High avidity anti-dsDNA {{antibodies}} {{are more}} speci c for SLE diagnosis, and more {{closely associated with}} renal involvement than intermediate or low-af nity anti-dsDNA antibodies. ELISA methods are largely used to detect anti-dsDNA, but their high sensitivity is inversely related to speci city because they also detect low avidity antibodies. We developedan ELISA assay based {{on the law of}} mass action and the competitive binding of dsDNA in solution and coated to microwells with anti-dsDNA antibodies. A simpli ed Scatchard plot analysis system was used to measure <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibody</b> avidity which was expressed as apparent af nity constant (Kaa), and quanti ed in liters per unit (l=U). We prospectively studied 101 consecutive SLE patients, who were followed for 3 years; three serum samples were sequentially collected from each patient during follow-up for determination of IgG <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibody</b> concentration, and anti-dsDNA avidity. SLE disease activity was estimated using the European Consensus Lupus Activity Measure (ECLAM) index. Sera from 100 healthy subjects and 133 patients with other connective tissue diseases or infectious diseases were also assayed as controls. The mean Kaa in SLE patients was 65. 2 § 47. 3 l=U, with no variations over time. Anti...|$|E
30|$|SLE is {{generally}} considered to be an immune complex-mediated disease where the lupus retinopathy occurs due to immune complex deposition in retinal vessels in SLE [12]. The incidence of antinuclear antibody (ANA) and <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibody</b> in SLE patients with retinal vascular disease versus without retinal vascular disease was 87.5 and 72.7  %. The higher positive antiphospholipid antibodies were seen in SLE patients in those with retinopathy compared to those without retinopathy was 18.1 versus 4.4  %. But all of them were not statistically significant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anti-dsDNA</b> <b>{{antibodies}}</b> are a {{group of}} anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and their target antigen is double stranded DNA. Blood tests such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence are routinely performed to detect <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibodies</b> in diagnostic laboratories. They are highly diagnostic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and are implicated in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis.|$|R
25|$|Patients with {{rheumatoid}} arthritis can develop <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibodies,</b> however {{they are usually}} treatment related. Anti-TNFα biological therapies, such as adalimumab, infliximab and etanercept, can often induce the production of <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibodies.</b> They are usually low avidity and are only detectable transiently after treatment. The presence of these antibodies can induce a lupus-like syndrome in some cases.|$|R

We investigated {{the role of}} <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibodies</b> in the pathogenesis of tubulo-interstitial pathology in lupus nephritis, focusing on their effect on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and fibrogenesis in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC). METHODS: Polyclonal <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibodies</b> were isolated from the sera of 10 patients with lupus nephritis using affinity chromatography. Confluent, growth-arrested human PTEC were cultured with human polyclonal <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibodies</b> or control IgG (10 μg/ml for both) for periods up to 48 h and synthesis of mediators of cell activation, EMT and fibrosis investigated. RESULTS: <b>Anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibodies</b> significantly induced synthesis of soluble and insoluble fibronectin in PTEC after 24 h incubation (P< 0. 01 for both). <b>Anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibodies</b> induced fibroblast specific protein- 1 and β-catenin synthesis (P< 0. 001 for both), which was accompanied by increased ERK, p 38 MAPK and PKC-α phosphorylation. Inhibition of ERK, p 38 MAPK and PKC-α activation using PD 98059, SB 203580 and Go 6976 respectively preserved normal PTEC phenotype and reduced anti-dsDNA antibody-induced EMT markers and fibronectin synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that human polyclonal <b>anti-dsDNA</b> <b>antibodies</b> can induce the EMT cascade and fibronectin synthesis in PTEC through activation of MAPK and PKC pathways, thereby contributing to amplification of matrix protein deposition within the tubulo-interstitium during pathogenesis of lupus nephritis...|$|R
