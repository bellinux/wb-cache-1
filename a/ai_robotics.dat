50|$|RoboCup is an {{international}} joint project to promote <b>AI,</b> <b>robotics,</b> and related field. It {{is an attempt to}} foster AI and intelligent robotics research by providing a standard problem where wide range of technologies can be integrated and examined. RoboCup chose to use soccer game as a central topic of research, aiming at innovations to be applied for socially significant problems and industries. The ultimate goal of the RoboCup project is by 2050, develop a team of fully autonomous humanoid robots that can win against the human world champion team in soccer. In order for a robot team to actually perform a soccer game, various technologies must be incorporated including: design principles of autonomous agents, multi-agent collaboration, strategy acquisition, real-time reasoning, robotics, and sensor-fusion. RoboCup is a task for a team of multiple fast-moving robots under a dynamic environment. RoboCup also offers a software platform for research on the software aspects of RoboCup. One of the major applications of RoboCup technologies is a search and rescue in large scale disaster. RoboCup initiated RoboCupRescue project to specifically promote research in socially significant issues.|$|E

The first interest {{of this study}} is to ascertain, from the viewpoint of workers, what types of worker characteristics are associated with the perception of risk of jobs being replaced by the development of <b>AI</b> and <b>robotics.</b> The second interest is to identify, from the viewpoint of consumers, what types of services are likely to be replaced by <b>AI</b> and <b>robotics.</b> The results suggest that malleable/adaptable high skills acquired through higher education, particularly in science and engineering, are complementary with new technologies such as <b>AI</b> and <b>robotics.</b> At the same time, occupation-specific skills acquired by attending professional schools or holding occupational licenses, particularly those related to human-intensive services, are less likely to be replaced by <b>AI</b> and <b>robotics...</b>|$|R

40|$|The area of <b>AI</b> <b>robotics</b> {{offers a}} set of {{fundamentally}} challenging problems when attempting to integrate logical reasoning functionality in such systems. The problems arise {{in part from the}} high degree of complexity in such architectures which include realtime behaviour, distribution, concurrency, various data latencies in operation and several levels of abstraction. For logic to work practically in such systems, traditional theorem proving, although important, is often not feasible for many of the functions of reasoning in such systems. In this article, we present a number of novel approaches to such reasoning functionality based on the use of temporal logic. The functionalities covered include automated planning, stream-based reasoning and execution monitoring. ...|$|E

Models of reasoning, sensing and control actions of such agents determine three different dimensions for discretization of the agent-world behavioral state space.

This paper is an attempt at exploring the concepts for the role for robotics in sustainable development. Industrial robotics {{is often associated with}} an unsustainable economic model. However, robotics also provides qualitative benefits through its precision, strength, sensing capabilities and computing power. New applications and deployment models can be devised that improve sustainability and quality of life.

This paper discusses the pedagogical principles, the exercises, student reactions, shortcomings, and lessons learned. The laboratory exercises were used to teach students in two locations (Tampa, Florida and Reykjavik, Iceland) with positive student reviews.

Intelligent {{connection}} of numeric data and symbolic or cognitive function plays {{a crucial role}} in <b>AI</b> <b>robotics.</b> This problem is also defined as symbol grounding or perceptual anchoring problem in different contexts. In this paper we consider this problem from fundamental robot kinematics, Qualitative kinematics of planar robots has been proposed in this paper based on aggregation operators and fuzzy qualitative trigonometry. Aggregation operators are employed to cluster a certain number of links into a link component in order to overcome the state explosion of fuzzy qualitative technique. On the other hand, fuzzy qualitative trigonometry replaces the role of conventional trigonometry in robotic kinematics. The proposed approach allows qualitative control of a planar robot without changing its motion control module. A case study has been given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The proposed approach can be extended to robot kinematics in 3 D space...|$|E
