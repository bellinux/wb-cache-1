In spite of that, he sometimes included non-firsthand information about products from the Americas, like the <b>antisyphilitic</b> guaiacum, in a very confusing form. When he did not draw from a direct source, he appears to draw from the works of one Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo.|$|E
5000|$|Andrew Plummer FRCP (1697-1756) was a Scottish {{physician}} and chemist. He was professor of chemistry at the University of Edinburgh from 1726 to 1755. He developed {{ideas on the}} attractive and repulsive forces involved in chemical affinity, which later had influence on his successors William Cullen and Joseph Black. [...] He compounded [...] "Plummer's pills", a mixture of calomel and antimony sulfide with guaiacum; the pills were originally compounded to treat psoriasis but were used {{for more than a}} century as an <b>antisyphilitic.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Arsphenamine {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1907 in Paul Ehrlich's lab by Alfred Bertheim. The <b>antisyphilitic</b> activity of this compound {{was discovered by}} Sahachiro Hata in 1909, during a survey of hundreds of newly synthesized organic arsenical compounds. Ehrlich had theorized that by screening many compounds, a drug could be discovered that would have anti-microbial activity but not kill the human patient. Ehrlich's team began their search for such a [...] "magic bullet" [...] among chemical derivatives of the dangerously toxic drug atoxyl. This project was the first organized team effort to optimize the biological activity of a lead compound through systematic chemical modifications, the basis for nearly all modern pharmaceutical research.|$|E
5000|$|Arsphenamine was {{originally}} called [...] "606" [...] {{because it was}} the sixth in the sixth group of compounds synthesized for testing; it was marketed by Hoechst AG under the trade name Salvarsan in 1910. Salvarsan was the first organic <b>antisyphilitic,</b> and a great improvement over the inorganic mercury compounds that had been used previously. It was distributed as a yellow, crystalline, hygroscopic powder that was highly unstable in air. This significantly complicated administration, as the drug had to be dissolved in several hundred milliliters of distilled, sterile water with minimal exposure to air to produce a solution suitable for injection. Some of the side effects attributed to Salvarsan, including rashes, liver damage, and risks of life and limb, were thought to be caused by improper handling and administration. This caused Ehrlich, who worked assiduously to standardize practices, to observe, [...] "the step from the laboratory to the patient's bedside ... is extraordinarily arduous and fraught with danger." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Reese {{developed}} a {{particular interest in}} neurosyphilis, which, in the 1920s and 1930s, accounted for >10% of all psychiatric illnesses. In the days before effective antibiotic therapy of that disease, somewhat unconventional treatments were utilized. One of them involved the purposeful infection of patients with malarial organisms, {{with the goal of}} creating a fever. That technique followed the empiric observation that syphilis sometimes improved after febrile illnesses. Reese collaborated with investigators at other institutions using this approach, known as the [...] "Wagner-Jauregg" [...] treatment. Lorenz and Bleckwenn also focused on neurosyphilis with respect to their research endeavors, and, as the preeminent neurologist of the group, Reese was asked to evaluate the side-effects of experimental <b>antisyphilitic</b> drugs on nervous system function. The trio of physicians at Wisconsin went on to publish more than 100 papers on neurosyphilis; in particular, they {{developed a}}nd refined an alternative to Wagner-Jauregg therapy, using an arsenical medication called tryparsamide. Until the advent of penicillin in the 1940s, it was probably the most effective treatment for neurosyphilis available.|$|E

40|$|Cell-mediated {{immunity}} {{is thought}} to be of critical importance in <b>antisyphilitic</b> host defense, but the exact mechanisms are still unknown. This fact is particularly true for HIV-infected persons with a deficit in CD 4 + T-cell number. We therefore obtained lesional skin samples from HIV+ and HIV− patients with secondary syphilis at different time points of lesional age to search both for causative microorganisms and to characterize the inflammatory infiltrate. By doing so, we detected Treponema pallidum spirochetes with a much greater abundance in late lesions of HIV+ individuals compared with the HIV− cohort. The dominating inflammatory cells were T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils at all stages and plasma cells in older lesions. In HIV− persons, T cells consisted of equal numbers of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cells, whereas in HIV+ patients, the majority of T cells belonged to the CD 8 lineage and produced both IFN-γ and IL- 17. Regulatory T cells and Langerhans cells were reduced in these patients compared with their HIV− counterparts. Because of our observations, we propose that T cells of both the CD 4 and CD 8 lineage are needed for an at least partial protective <b>antisyphilitic</b> immunity. Compensation mechanisms in HIV+ individuals, such as an increase of Tc 1 / 17 cells as well as a reduction in immunoregulatory Langerhans cells and T cells, apparently do not overcome the deficiencies in these patients to eliminate the spirochete...|$|E

30|$|The {{differential}} {{diagnosis of the}} lesion in the pulmonary is mostly the tumor like pulmonary lesion, Pulmonary syphilis. Pulmonary manifestations of acquired syphilis can be of the bronchitic type observed during the secondary stage or tertiary stage and consist either of solitary lesions {{with the appearance of}} an abscess or of multiple lesions which are frequently of smaller size and do not produce clinical symptoms (Schibli and Harms 1981). The diagnosis of pulmonary syphilis may be established by the following criteria: First, other causes of chronic lung disease should be excluded by intensive clinical and laboratory study. Second, biopsy material should show the histological changes of a gumma. Since spirochetes can rarely be demonstrated in a syphilitic gumma, other known causes of chronic granulomatous inflammation such as mycotic and mycobacterial agents must be excluded by appropriate histological and cultural studies. Third, the lesion should resolve after <b>antisyphilitic</b> therapy, usually with penicillin (Nunnelee 2007).|$|E
40|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century, a new disease {{appeared}} in India. Described {{for the first}} time in the ayurvedic classic Bhāvaprakāśa by Bhāvamiśra, it was called phiraṅgaroga, “disease of the Franks”. Given the name and what we know from contemporary reports of European observers in India, this was very likely the correlate to the so-called “French disease” or “Morbus Gallicus”, i. e., syphilis. The Bhāvaprakāśa describes the symptoms and various stages of phiraṅgaroga and presents seven different cures. Five of these prescribe the use of mercury: Three recipes for the ingestion of mercury, one recipe for using mercury as a fumigant and one in which mercury is rubbed into the patient’s hands. In this chapter, I will discuss Bhāvamiśṛa’s representation of the disease and the therapies he proposes for it.

40|$|IT is very {{difficult}} to establish the diagnosis of syphilitic aortitis in children and adolescents, and confirmation by pathological study is absolute only if the Treponema pallidum is found in the aorta. Stolkind * emphasized that the Treponema pallidum is not found in the aorta of children with congenital syphilis who are more than one year old, and for this reason the diagnosis of congenital syphilitic aortitis has rarely been proved in older children or adolescents. Mc-Donald 2 has indicated that the aortic lesions of congenital syphilis differ in no way from those of the acquired form. The order of frequency with which McCord 3 found the spirochete in various organs in 243 fetal autopsies is as follows: lungs, kidneys, liver, spleen, adrenals, thymus, heart, spinal cord, and aorta. At times all the organs mentioned harbored the organism, at times only one or two organs. However, he felt that if the Treponema pallidum were found in one organ it could be found in all.

40|$|In 1937, as {{a result}} of the {{investigation}} of 458 cases (320 men and 138 women), Dr. Hutton and I brought to the notice of the Society three aspects of the problem of neurosyphilis (Nicol and Hutton). The first was the employment of ordinary <b>antisyphilitic</b> treatment (mainly the use of trivalent arsenicals) with its detrimental effect on the subsequent course of the disease. The investigation of this group made abundantly clear the importance and absolute necessity of performing a lumbar puncture in all late and latent cases with a persistent seropositive Wasser-mann reaction. The second aspect of neurosyphilis to be examined was the evidence of syphilis in partners and in the families of patients undergoing treatment; it was demonstrated that the amount of evidence of latent neurosyphilis was surprisingly great. Lastly, a glimpse into the future was taken; we advocated the use of malaria in preference to other forms of therapy, although it was agreed that in certain circumstances treatment with pentavalent arsenic, in the form of tryparsamide, provided efficient treatment. The importance of using malaria therapy or tryparsa-mide for the latent case of neurosyphilis, as a prophylactic against the subsequen...|$|E
30|$|Syphilitic aortic {{aneurysm}} (SAA) {{is caused by}} tertiary stage of syphilis infection. As the wide application of penicillin, this complication is becoming rarer than before. However, syphilitic aortitis (SA) dose still exist in developed and developing country (Vaideeswar 2010; Roberts et al. 2009). At the beginning, inflammation starts from outermost layer of the blood vessel, including the vasa vasorum that supply the aorta itself with blood. As the situation worsens, the vasa vasorum undergo hyperplastic thickening of their walls thereby restricting blood flow and causing ischemia of the outer two-thirds of the aortic wall. If it continues progressing, syphilitic aortitis leads to an {{aortic aneurysm}}. Recognition of cardiovascular syphilis is important because {{in addition to the}} broader management of aneurysmal disease, it warrants antibiotic therapy for which penicillin is preferred (Mohamed Sarjun Basha et al. 2016; Beppu et al. 2014). Pulmonary lesions in patients with tertiary syphilis are considered to be of syphilitic origin if other causes can be excluded and particularly if the lesion disappears after <b>antisyphilitic</b> treatment (de Almeida Feitosa et al. 2015). However, the SAA with lung cancer is a very rare disease in patient. Herein, we report a very rare case of SAA with a neoplasm located in the left lower lobe in a 55 -year-old man.|$|E
40|$|The {{danger of}} syphilitic {{infection}} to the fetus in utero, {{regardless of whether}} the maternal syphilis is active or latent, is well known. Indeed, re-treatment throughout the period of gestation is advised by the Cooperative Clinical Group 8 even when the mother has received adequate <b>antisyphilitic</b> therapy prior to pregnancy and presents no serological or clinical evidence of this disease when she is first seen in her pregnancy. Consequently, {{the question of whether or}} not re-treatment is necessary in those patients who have become pregnant subsequent to receiving massive dose arsenotherapy by the constant intravenous-drip procedure of Hyman-and his associates" 6 is an important one.

In one instance the circulating blood was found to be infectious. Transfer of similar tissues from syphilitic rabbits treated with arsphenamine late {{in the course of the}} disease failed to disclose syphilitic infection of any of these tissues. In one animal, in which keratitis developed both before and after treatment, the blood, internal organs, and lymph nodes were found to be non-infectious in spite of the fact that the cornea was shown to be the site of a syphilitic inflammation. Transfer of lymph nodes or internal organs of treated syphilitic rabbits is probably the best method of evaluating an <b>antisyphilitic</b> agent, but it must be supplemented by careful observation of treated animals over an appreciable interval of time following treatment. The results of this study support the idea that failure to reinoculate a treated syphilitic animal does not necessarily mean the existence of the first infection but might beinterpreted as indicating the presence of an acquired resistance which persists in rabbits in which no trace of the first infection can be demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Pharmaceutical {{manufacturers}} {{responded to}} the growth of medical science by building company laboratories. This work explores how science was used by such firms and their relationship to the Philadelphia medical community. Initially scientists were employed in a variety of tasks that related more to a company 2 ̆ 7 s image than to innovation. Laboratory staff measured raw materials, standardized extracts and promoted medicines at Smith Kline, Wyeth, and Parke Davis. Diphtheria antitoxin was the first innovation to have a marked impact on pharmaceutical manufacturing. It was first produced in large quantities by public health departments, which soon found themselves in competition with commercial manufacturers. Firms soon recaptured the dominant position. The H. K. Mulford Company led the way, hiring a medical scientist, Joseph McFarland, away from the public health department. Mulford was particularly effective in fostering close contacts with the medical community through advertising material which included up-to-date summaries of technical information. ^ By 1900 some firms were thoroughly embued with scientific ideals. The new importance of science was demonstrated when the government, influenced by the larger companies, used legislation in 1902 and 1906 to regulate the industry, applying such technical criteria as the sophistication of laboratories and their staffs. While American companies had become successful in manufacturing and marketing biological medicines by the Great War, they were behind their German competitors who innovated and patented extensively. The War gave Americans an opportunity to break this pattern. For example, in 1915 the Dermatological Research Laboratories synthesised the <b>antisyphilitic,</b> Salvarsan, and by infringing on the Hoechst patent, helped to accelerate the confiscation of enemy-held property. ^ Wartime profits stimulated a merger wave through the industry. The association of older, large companies with those which were scientifically advanced laid the foundations for later expansion. Merck bought Powers, Weightman and Rosengarten, and Abbott acquired the Dermatological Research Laboratories. In 1929 Sharp and Dohme, with its strong marketing network, merged with Mulford, whose laboratories were unsurpassed. By this time industrial research in all its facets was a necessary part of pharmaceutical manufacturing. ...|$|E
