5|$|Four non-engineering {{scientific}} experiments were planned, two requiring the active {{involvement of the}} astronaut and two completely passive. The first involved the astronaut watching for four high-powered flares while passing over Woomera, Australia, and for a xenon <b>arc</b> <b>lamp</b> while passing over Durban, South Africa. The second involved two sets of photographs to be taken using a 70mm Hasselblad camera as well as conventional color photographs of the Earth from orbit. Focusing on geological features and cloud patterns, photographs were to be taken {{through a set of}} colored filters provided by the U. S. Weather Bureau. The latter were intended to help calibrate the spectral reflectivity of clouds and surface features, which in turn would help improve the cameras on future weather satellites. The passive experimentation packages were two sets of radiation-sensitive photographic films, from the Goddard Space Flight Center and the U. S. Navy School of Aviation Medicine, and a set of eight different experimental ablative materials attached to the outside of the spacecraft to test their performance during re-entry.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{light source}} used on clear weather was a gas burner. On bad weather an electric <b>arc</b> <b>lamp</b> was used, electricity being supplied by a de Méritens generators {{driven by a}} Crossley coal gas engine. On especially bad weather a second generator was also operated, resulting in a 6,000,000 cd light, the world's most powerful at the time. One of the generators, the switchboard and one <b>arc</b> <b>lamp</b> still exist, owned by the Powerhouse Museum. The generator and the switchboard are {{on display at the}} lighthouse.|$|E

25|$|Other UV sources {{with more}} {{continuous}} emission spectra include xenon <b>arc</b> <b>lamps</b> (commonly used as sunlight simulators), deuterium <b>arc</b> <b>lamps,</b> mercury-xenon <b>arc</b> <b>lamps,</b> and metal-halide <b>arc</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|R

25|$|Graphite is an {{electric}} conductor, consequently, useful in such applications as <b>arc</b> <b>lamp</b> electrodes. It can conduct electricity {{due to the}} vast electron delocalization within the carbon layers (a phenomenon called aromaticity). These valence electrons are free to move, so are able to conduct electricity. However, the electricity is primarily conducted within {{the plane of the}} layers. The conductive properties of powdered graphite allow its use as pressure sensor in carbon microphones.|$|E
25|$|The first {{successful}} <b>arc</b> <b>lamp</b> {{was developed by}} Russian engineer Pavel Yablochkov, and used the Gramme generator. Its advantage lay {{in the fact that}} it didn't require the use of a mechanical regulator like its predecessors. It was first exhibited at the Paris Exposition of 1878 and was heavily promoted by Gramme. The arc light was installed along the half mile length of Avenue de l'Opéra, Place du Theatre Francais and around the Place de l'Opéra in 1878.|$|E
25|$|These {{lighting}} instruments come in {{a variety}} of sizes with light sources ranging from low power incandescent light bulbs to very powerful xenon arc lamps. Carbon <b>arc</b> <b>lamp</b> spots were common until the 1990s, using the arc between carbon rods as their light source. These follow spots required special installations that include high volume ventilation due to the hazardous fumes produced by the carbon arc. The current generation, xenon, has extremely high internal pressure in the lamp and thus has its own safety concerns.|$|E
5000|$|Wabash Indiana was {{the first}} city to use <b>arc</b> <b>lamps.</b> On March 31, 1880, they turned on four <b>arc</b> <b>lamps</b> mounted on the towering dome of city hall. [...] Wabash used a {{self-regulating}} lamp invented by Charles Brush in 1870.|$|R
500|$|Carbon <b>arc</b> <b>lamps</b> use {{a mixture}} of rare earth {{elements}} to improve the light quality. This [...] application, especially by the motion picture industry for studio lighting and projection, consumed about 25% of the rare-earth compounds produced until the phase out of carbon <b>arc</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Arc</b> <b>lamps</b> were {{superseded}} by filament lamps in most roles, remaining in only certain niche {{applications such as}} cinema projection, followspots, and searchlights. Even in these applications conventional carbon <b>arc</b> <b>lamps</b> are being pushed into obsolescence by xenon <b>arc</b> <b>lamps,</b> but were still being manufactured as spotlights at least as late as 1982 and are still manufactured {{for at least one}} purpose [...] - [...] simulating sunlight in [...] "accelerated aging" [...] machines intended to estimate how fast a material is likely to be degraded by environmental exposure.|$|R
25|$|In the 1850s, many {{of these}} {{problems}} were solved by the <b>arc</b> <b>lamp</b> invented by William Petrie and William Staite. The lamp used a magneto-electric generator and had a self-regulating mechanism to control {{the gap between the}} two carbon rods. Their light was used to light up the National Gallery in London and was a great novelty at the time. These arc lamps and designs similar to it, powered by large magnetos, were first installed on English lighthouses in the mid 1850s, but the power limitations prevented these models from being a proper success.|$|E
25|$|A {{variation}} of the incandescent lamp did not use a hot wire filament, but instead used an arc struck on a spherical bead electrode to produce heat. The electrode then became incandescent, with the arc contributing little to the light produced. Such lamps were used for projection or illumination for scientific instruments such as microscopes. These arc lamps ran on relatively low voltages and incorporated tungsten filaments to start ionization within the envelope. They provided the intense concentrated light of an <b>arc</b> <b>lamp</b> but were easier to operate. Developed around 1915, these lamps were displaced by mercury and xenon arc lamps.|$|E
25|$|The ultra-violet {{light to}} produce these effects may be {{obtained}} from an <b>arc</b> <b>lamp,</b> or by burning magnesium, or by sparking with an induction coil between zinc or cadmium terminals, the light from which is very rich in ultra-violet rays. Sunlight is not rich in ultra-violet rays, as these have been absorbed by the atmosphere, {{and it does not}} produce nearly so large an effect as the arc-light. Many substances besides metals discharge negative electricity under the action of ultraviolet light: lists of these substances will be found in papers by G. C. Schmidt and O. Knoblauch.|$|E

25|$|The {{light source}} {{to be used}} should be small and bright. The best shadows come from light {{proceeding}} from the smallest possible point. Albert Almoznino suggests a candle, a flashlight (with the lens and reflector removed) or any very small light. If a bulb is used, it should be clear. J. C. Cannell suggests in his book, Modern Conjuring For Amateurs, that the best source of light is the electric arc, which Almoznino agrees to the small <b>arc</b> <b>lamp,</b> and the second best being the limelight (if used with a high-class jet). Trewey suggests the chalk for the limelight to be cut in a triangular form, or else it will produce a gray border around the shadow. Cannell states another favorite amongst shadowgraphists {{is the use of}} acetylene gas (i.e. acetylene gas lamp or carbide lamp). Nowadays it is possible to use a single lensless (for example, SMD) LED.|$|E
25|$|Lenard {{observed}} {{the variation in}} electron energy with light frequency using a powerful electric <b>arc</b> <b>lamp</b> which enabled him to investigate large changes in intensity, and that had sufficient power to enable him to investigate the variation of potential with light frequency. His experiment directly measured potentials, not electron kinetic energy: he found the electron energy by relating it to the maximum stopping potential (voltage) in a phototube. He found that the calculated maximum electron kinetic energy {{is determined by the}} frequency of the light. For example, an increase in frequency results in an increase in the maximum kinetic energy calculated for an electron upon liberation – ultraviolet radiation would require a higher applied stopping potential to stop current in a phototube than blue light. However Lenard's results were qualitative rather than quantitative because of the difficulty in performing the experiments: the experiments needed to be done on freshly cut metal so that the pure metal was observed, but it oxidised {{in a matter of minutes}} even in the partial vacuums he used. The current emitted by the surface was determined by the light's intensity, or brightness: doubling the intensity of the light doubled the number of electrons emitted from the surface.|$|E
25|$|Alastair Pilkington {{invented the}} float glass method of {{manufacture}} in 1957 at St Helens, announcing it in January 1959. It was manufacturered from 1961, and 80% of the world's glass is made with the process; the former site closed in 2014 and it is made now at the Green Gate site. Pears soap, made at Port Sunlight, is the world's first registered brand, and world's oldest brand in existence. Elihu Thomson, born in Manchester who subsequently moved to America, formed Thomson-CSF which became Thales Group in 2000. The British part (British Thomson-Houston) would later become part of GEC; he invented the <b>arc</b> <b>lamp.</b> Henry Brunner from Liverpool would join with Ludwig Mond in the 1860s to form a chemical company which became ICI in 1926. Mossbay Steelworks in Workington, when opened in 1877, were the world's first large-scale steelworks; its austenitic manganese steel (mangalloy) was produced from 1877 until 1974, with Britain's railways converting from iron to steel by the 1880s. Track was made there for the UK's railways (exclusively from the 1970s onwards, with the steel made in Teesside) until August 2006; much of the rails made were exported (from 1882), with its main competitor being Voestalpine of Austria, and a plant (bought by British Steel in 1999) in Hayange, France, who make all of SNCF's railway tracks, and the Katowice Steelworks in Poland. Workington was thought {{to make the best}} quality rail track in the world.|$|E

25|$|With {{the help}} of Charles Stearn, an expert on vacuum pumps, in 1878, Swan {{developed}} a method of processing that avoided the early bulb blackening. This received a British Patent in 1880. On 18 December 1878, a lamp using a slender carbon rod was shown {{at a meeting of}} the Newcastle Chemical Society, and Swan gave a working demonstration at their meeting on 17 January 1879. It was also shown to 700 who attended a meeting of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne on 3 February 1879. These lamps used a carbon rod from an <b>arc</b> <b>lamp</b> rather than a slender filament. Thus they had low resistance and required very large conductors to supply the necessary current, so they were not commercially practical, although they did furnish a demonstration of the possibilities of incandescent lighting with relatively high vacuum, a carbon conductor, and platinum lead-in wires. This bulb lasted about 40 hours. Swan then turned his attention to producing a better carbon filament and the means of attaching its ends. He devised a method of treating cotton to produce 'parchmentised thread' in the early 1880s and obtained British Patent 4933 that same year. From this year he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in England. His house, Underhill, Low Fell, Gateshead, was the first in the world to be lit by a lightbulb and also the first house in the world to be lit by hydroelectric power. In 1878 the home of Lord Armstrong at Cragside was also among the first houses to be lit by electricity. In the early 1880s he had started his company. In 1881, the Savoy Theatre in the City of Westminster, London was lit by Swan incandescent lightbulbs, which was the first theatre, and the first public building in the world, to be lit entirely by electricity. The first street in the world to be lit by an incandescent lightbulb was Mosley Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom. It was lit by Joseph Swan's incandescent lamp on 3 February 1879.|$|E

5000|$|Plasma [...] "arc" [...] or {{discharge}} lamps using hydrogen are notable for their high output in the ultraviolet, with comparatively little output in the visible and infrared. This {{is similar to}} the situation in a hydrogen flame. <b>Arc</b> <b>lamps</b> made with ordinary light-hydrogen (hydrogen-1) provide a very similar UV spectrum to deuterium, and have been used in UV spectroscopes. However, lamps using deuterium have a longer life span and an emissivity (intensity) {{at the far end of}} their UV range which is three to five times that of an ordinary hydrogen arc bulb, at the same temperature. Deuterium <b>arc</b> <b>lamps,</b> therefore, despite being several times more expensive, are considered a superior light source to light-hydrogen <b>arc</b> <b>lamps,</b> for the shortwave UV range.|$|R

50|$|Open <b>Arc</b> <b>lamps</b> {{were used}} in the late 19th & early 20th century by many large cities for street lighting.
