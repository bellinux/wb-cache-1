5|$|Barn owls are {{relatively}} common {{throughout most of}} their range and not considered globally threatened. However, locally severe declines from organochlorine (e.g., DDT) poisoning in the mid-20th century and rodenticides in the late 20th century have affected some populations, particularly in Europe and North America. Intensification of agricultural practices often means that the rough grassland that provides the best foraging habitat is lost. While barn owls are prolific breeders and able to recover from short-term population decreases, {{they are not as}} common in some areas <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be. A 1995–1997 survey put their British population at between 3,000 and 5,000 breeding pairs, out of an average of about 150,000 pairs in the whole of Europe. In the USA, barn owls are listed as endangered species in seven Midwestern states, and in the European Community they are considered a Species of European Concern.|$|E

25|$|The {{demand for}} organs {{significantly}} surpasses {{the number of}} donors everywhere in the world. There are more potential recipients on organ donation waiting lists than organ donors. In particular, due to significant advances in dialysis techniques, patients suffering from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) can survive longer than ever before. Because these patients don't die as quickly <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to,</b> and as kidney failure increases with the rising age and prevalence of high blood pressure and diabetes in a society, the need especially for kidneys rises every year.|$|E

500|$|Tatuidris is rare but broadly distributed. The ants {{inhabit the}} leaf litter of Neotropical forests in Central and South America, from Mexico to French Guiana, [...] central Brazil, and Amazonian Peru. No {{collections}} are {{known from the}} Caribbean, Galápagos, or other islands. Most specimens and collections are currently known to occur in localities west of the Andes, with more collections tending to occur towards Central America and Mexico. Most collections come from mountainside (pre-montane) areas at mid elevations (usually 800–1200 meters of altitude). Collections from the lowland Amazon rainforest are few. Published records are few, but {{with the advent of}} litter sifting and Winkler extraction as a popular method of ant collecting, Tatuidris are not as rare <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> seem.

Conrad's jealous seneschal interferes and visits Guillaume's family, where he gives his mother a valuable ring and gains her confidence; from her he learns that Liénor has a particular birthmark {{in the shape of a}} rose on her thigh.

500|$|An {{extensive}} {{account of}} the controversy around the book was published {{at the same time}} as the new edition, largely supporting Wilson's views. Looking back at Sociobiology 35 years later, the philosopher of biology Michael Ruse called the book [...] "a pretty remarkable achievement" [...] of huge scope, [...] "firmly in the Darwinian paradigm of evolution through natural selection". He found one aspect of the book [...] "very peculiar" [...] in its [...] "metaphysical underpinning", namely that Wilson was committed to the idea of progress in biology, [...] "the idea that organic life has proceeded from the very simple to the very complex, from the value-free to the value-laden, from (<b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> say in the 19th century) the monad to the man." [...] Ruse observed that while producing humans might look like progress, evolution had [...] "also produced smallpox and syphilis and potato blight," [...] raising [...] "serious doubts about whether evolution is progressive." [...] Ruse noted that Gould's 1989 book Wonderful Life was entirely an attack on this idea of progress.|$|E

In addition, framework components are glued together with AOP, thus {{it is possible to}} plug (only) features required for each specific application / target platform...|$|R

40|$|Speakers {{often use}} hand {{gestures}} {{when talking about}} or describing physical objects.

We first observe participants <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>use</b> gestures <b>to</b> describe real-world objects to another person. From these observations, we derive the data miming approach, which is based on a voxel representation of the space traced by the speaker’s hands over the duration of the gesture.
