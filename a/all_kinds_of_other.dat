We {{do not know how}} many the secret services kept under surveillance, held criminally liable, arrested, sent to psychiatric hospitals, or who were sacked from their jobs, and restricted in <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> ways in the exercise of their rights. No objective assessment {{of the total number of}} repressed persons is possible without fundamental analysis of archival documents. The difficulty is that the required data are very diverse and are not to be found in a single archive. They are scattered between the State Archive of the Russian Federation, the archive of the Russian Federation State Statistical Committee (Goskomstat), the archives of the RF Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD of Russia), the FSB of Russia, the RF General Prosecutor's Office, and the Russian Military and Historical Archive. Further documents are held in the archives of 83 constituent entities of the Russian Federation, in urban and regional archives, as well as in the archives of the former Soviet Republics, now the 11 independent countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States or the three Baltic States (Baltics).|$|E

[...] Farrell {{explained}} the motivation he gave to the character, stating [...] "This guy thinks he's God's gift to women, God's gift to intellect, to humor, to the club scene, to everything. It's all part of his grandiose sense of self-esteem, which is probably masking a deeper sense of being a disappointment to his father and being riddled with envy over the relationship his father had with Kurt, and <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> things. With Pellit, Seth gave me complete license to act as pathologically screwed up as possible." [...] Farrell contributed significantly to the appearance of his character, suggesting the comb over hairstyle, pot-belly and an affinity for Chinese dragons.|$|E
500|$|However, Trio members never {{claimed to}} be folksingers and were never {{comfortable}} with the label. The liner notes for the group's first album featured a quotation from Dave Guard asserting that [...] "We are not folksingers in the accepted sense of the word." [...] Guard later told journalist Richard Hadlock in Down Beat magazine: [...] "We are not students of folk music; the basic thing for us is honest and worthwhile songs that people can pick up and become involved in." [...] Nick Reynolds added in the same article: [...] "We don't collect old songs {{in the sense that}} the academic cats do... We get new tunes to look over every day. Each one of us has his ears open constantly to new material or old stuff that's good." [...] Bob Shane remarked years later: [...] "To call the Kingston Trio folksingers was kind of stupid in the first place. We never called ourselves folksingers... We did folk-oriented material, but we did it amid <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> stuff. But they didn't know what to call us with our instruments, so Capitol Records called us folksingers and gave us credit for starting this whole boom." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} the {{advantages}} of aggregate level time series analysis {{for the study of}} media coverage are discussed. This type of analysis offers the opportunity to answer questions relating to causes and effects of media attention for issues and <b>all</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> content characteristics. Data that ask for a time series approach have become widely available during the past years, due to the rise of digital archives and social media such as Twitter and Facebook. This type of analysis allows for answering a set of interesting research questions and strong inferences about causal processes. Common challenges in time series analysis, relating to stationarity, accounting for a series’ past and autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity are discussed. Two useful approaches, ARIMA and VAR, are introduced stepwise. An empirical example, dealing with intermedia agenda-setting between different newspapers in the Netherlands, demonstrates how both techniques can be applied and how they provide insightful answers to interesting research problems...|$|R

Napolitano's questions were critical of the airlines' plans to impose self-regulation in response to recent customer service controversies. As the founder and Chair of the Congressional Mental Health Caucus, Napolitano further asked whether the Airlines provide mental health services to their employees because of the stressful nature of flight attendant jobs and the increasing demands that airline companies put on flight attendants. Mr. William J. McGee, the country’s foremost expert and advocate on consumer rights as the Aviation Consultant for Consumers Union responded that this was “an excellent question because… {{right now we have}} a situation where employees are under tremendous strain because of the executive decisions that are putting flight attendants in the front lines of many of these situations. Flight attendants have a primary responsibility to ensure safety, evacuation, and of course customer service, but we have asked them to be bouncers, and police officers, and <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> things, so {{there is no question that}} there is an issue of training as well.” ...|$|E

60|$|One of {{the first}} things the Emperor did was to send his friend Hermann Gessler to govern the country. Gessler was not a nice man, and it soon became plain that he would never make himself really popular with the Swiss. The point on which they {{disagreed}} in particular was the question of taxes. The Swiss, who were a simple and thrifty people, objected to paying taxes of any sort. They said they wanted to spend their money on <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> things. Gessler, on the other hand, wished to put a tax on everything, and, being Governor, he did it. He made everyone who owned a flock of sheep pay a certain sum of money to him; and if the farmer sold his sheep and bought cows, he had to pay rather more money to Gessler for the cows than he had paid for the sheep. Gessler also taxed bread, and biscuits, and jam, and buns, and lemonade, and, in fact, everything he could think of, till the people of Switzerland determined to complain. They appointed Walter Fürst, who had red hair and looked fierce; Werner Stauffacher, who had gray hair and was always wondering how he ought to pronounce his name; and Arnold of Melchthal, who had light-yellow hair and was supposed to {{know a great deal about}} the law, to make the complaint. They called on the Governor one lovely morning in April, and were shown into the Hall of Audience.|$|E
60|$|Upwards {{from his}} {{abstracted}} childhood, Adam Wayne had grown strongly and silently {{in a certain}} quality or capacity which is in modern cities almost entirely artificial, but which can be natural, and was primarily almost brutally natural in him, the quality or capacity of patriotism.

A child speaking of his country or his village may make every mistake in Mandeville or tell every lie in Munchausen, but in his statement {{there will be no}} psychological lies any more than there can be in a good song. Adam Wayne, as a boy, had for his dull streets in Notting Hill the ultimate and ancient sentiment that went out to Athens or Jerusalem. He knew the secret of the passion, those secrets which make real old national songs sound so strange to our civilisation. He knew that real patriotism tends to sing about sorrows and forlorn hopes much more than about victory. He knew that in proper names themselves is half the poetry of all national poems. Above all, he knew the supreme psychological fact about patriotism, as certain in connection with it as that a fine shame comes to all lovers, the fact that the patriot never under any circumstances boasts of the largeness of his country, but always, and of necessity, boasts of the smallness of it.|$|E
