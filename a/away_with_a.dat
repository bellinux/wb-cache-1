5|$|Alpha Apodis is {{an orange}} giant of {{spectral}} type K3III located 447 ± 8 {{light years away}} from Earth, with an apparent magnitude of 3.8. It spent much of its life as a blue-white (B-type) main sequence star before expanding, cooling and brightening as it used up its core hydrogen. It has swollen to 48 times the Sun's diameter, and shines with a luminosity approximately 928 {{times that of the}} Sun, with a surface temperature of 4312 K. Beta Apodis is an orange giant 157 ± 2 light years <b>away,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> magnitude of 4.2. It is around 1.84 times as massive as the Sun, with a surface temperature of 4677 K. Gamma Apodis is a yellow giant of spectral type G8III located 156 ± 1 light-years <b>away,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> magnitude of 3.87.

After being summoned to the stewards at the end of qualifying, he walked <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> reprimand, but was not penalised. Behind Rosberg in second place, the two Ferrari cars of Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen were third and fourth respectively. At {{the tail end of the}} field, three pairs of cars were eliminated: both Sauber, Manor and Renault drivers missed Q2.|$|E
5|$|Raskolnikov is at {{this point}} {{completely}} torn; he is urged by Sonya to confess, and Svidrigaïlov's testimony could potentially convict him. Furthermore, Porfiry confronts Raskolnikov with his suspicions and assures him that confession would substantially lighten his sentence. Meanwhile, Svidrigaïlov attempts to seduce Dunya, but when he realizes that she will never love him, he lets her go. He then spends a night in confusion and in the morning shoots himself. This same morning, Raskolnikov goes again to Sonya, who again urges him to confess and to clear his conscience. He makes his way to the police station, where he is met by the news of Svidrigaïlov's suicide. He hesitates a moment, thinking again that he might get <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> perfect crime, but is persuaded by Sonya to confess.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{played well}} also, {{especially}} on defense {{where they were}} able to create four turnovers including Thompson's first interception in 99pass attempts. Defensive back Antonio Huffman returned the pick 54yards for a touchdown and put the Red Raiders up 24–10 late in the second quarter. Texas Tech was able to capitalize on the other take-aways as well, turning them into 14more points and held the lead until the fourth quarter. Two missed field goals and a fired-up Sooner defense held the Red Raiders off, however, and the Sooners were able to put the game <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> two-yard touchdown run by Brown.|$|E

Navy kicker Joe Buckley missed a 32-yard field goal attempt, quarterback Ricky Dobbs lost a fumble at the Maryland 1-yard line, and Maryland eventually walked <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 17–14 victory.|$|E

5|$|Zeta Coronae Australis is {{a rapidly}} {{rotating}} main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 4.8, 221.7 light years from Earth.

Theta Coronae Australis lies further to the west, a yellow giant of spectral type G8III and apparent magnitude 4.62.

5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{attempts}} to make everyone's Christmas wishes come true.

In a drunken stupor, she tells Andy that her Christmas wish is for Jessica to die. Offended, he tells her to get over their breakup before storming off. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) does her part as a friend of Erin's by being mean to Jessica. Andy becomes concerned about Erin's behavior, not least because Robert California (James Spader) has revealed that his marriage is ending, spends {{a good deal of the}} party hanging out with Erin and pressures her into drinking shots. When Andy has to drive a drunken Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) home, he sees Erin getting into Robert's car and he follows them with a look of panic on his face. However, he covertly witnesses Robert being a gentleman and sending Erin off to her apartment with a hug and words of encouragement.
