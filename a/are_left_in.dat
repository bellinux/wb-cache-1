5|$|A player (or a pair), {{who wins}} {{at least one}} trick {{receives}} an ability to gain more round points upon declaring the card combinations. In Tute in Pairs the declarations can be performed {{until the end of}} round; in Two-player Tute this ability persists until only two cards <b>are</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the deck.|$|E
5|$|The plot {{consists}} {{mostly of}} the Daleks and Cybermen waging a global war, with humanity {{caught in the}} cataclysm. The Doctor, the Tyler family, and Mickey Smith fight for their lives trying to reverse the situation. They are successful, but at an emotional cost to the Doctor and Rose, as they <b>are</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> separate universes.|$|E
5|$|After {{a player}} makes the first baza, that player {{is allowed to}} {{announce}} declarations. Declaring is allowed until the last two cards <b>are</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the stock (the last faced-down card, and the faced-up trump below it). After these final two cards are picked up, all of the cards the players hold must be played in order to finish the round. When the round is over, the players start to count their scores (see Scoring below). After the counting ends, and their scores are calculated, the cards in the bazas are mixed again in a single stock to be dealt {{at the start of}} the next round.|$|E

5|$|If {{permanent}} brachytherapy is used, {{low dose}} radioactive sources (seeds) <b>are</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the body after treatment – the radiation levels are very low and decrease over time. In addition, the irradiation only affects tissues {{within a few}} millimeters of the radioactive sources (i.e. the tumour being treated). As a precaution, some people receiving permanent brachytherapy may be advised to not hold any small children or be too close to pregnant women {{for a short time}} after treatment. Radiation oncologists or nurses can provide specific instructions to patients and advise for how long they need to be careful.|$|E
5|$|The {{epilogue}} {{tells of}} how Raskolnikov is sentenced {{to eight years}} of penal servitude in Siberia, where Sonya follows him. Dunya and Razumikhin marry and <b>are</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> a happy position {{by the end of}} the novel, while Pulkheria, Raskolnikov's mother, falls ill and dies, unable to cope with her son's situation. Raskolnikov himself struggles in Siberia. It is only after some time in prison that his redemption and moral regeneration begin under Sonya's loving influence.|$|E
5|$|The {{winner of}} the trick takes the first card from the stock, and the loser the second; thus, until the stock runs out, they each hold ten cards {{at the start of}} every trick. When the trump card {{at the bottom of the}} deck is {{superior}} to a 7 (Ace, Three, King, Knight, or Knave), the player that holds the 7 of the trump suit is able to exchange it for any of these. The 7, and cards of lesser value (6, 5, and 4), can later be exchanged only by a 2. The trump exchanges are allowed anytime in the game until only the last two cards <b>are</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the stock.|$|E

5|$|Although {{attacks against}} living humans are rare, the spotted hyena readily feeds on human corpses. In the {{tradition}} of the Maasai and the Hadza, corpses <b>are</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the open for spotted hyenas to eat. A corpse rejected by hyenas is seen as having something wrong with it, and liable to cause social disgrace, therefore {{it is not uncommon for}} bodies to be covered in fat and blood from a slaughtered ox. In Ethiopia, hyenas were reported to feed extensively on the corpses of victims of the 1960 attempted coup and the Red Terror. Hyenas habituated to scavenging on human corpses may develop bold behaviours towards living people; hyena attacks on people in southern Sudan increased during the Second Sudanese Civil War, when human corpses were readily available to them.|$|E
5|$|Wood small-reed (Calamagrostis epigejos) {{is present}} {{in the center of the}} site and threatens to spread into {{herbaceous}} areas. It compromises sustainability of stations, including man orchid and bee orchid populations. Two distinct zones can be distinguished. The first, where the wood small-reed has a very high rate of recovery, is not hosting any heritage value. It is mowed early and disposed of. Grazing is not possible at the moment. The second, on the contrary, not densely colonized by this plant is much more of a fragile situation due to the presence of orchids and the sickle-bearing bush cricket or long-horned groundhopper. Differentiated management is applied depending on the issues. At orchid stations, slight thinning is done early by hand pruning. The less dense areas where the grass is sparse (conducive to the long-horned groundhopper (Tetrix tenuicornis)) are pulled. In the newly opened areas, a systematic and annual pulling avoids expansion. Finally, dense areas, well exposed, <b>are</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> that state.|$|E

25|$|At Route Markers, clue {{envelopes}} {{are placed}} inside a box mounted to the Marker.

25|$|Some countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, have wine {{labeling}} {{laws that}} {{require the use of}} fining agents that may be an allergenic substance to appear on the wine label.

A small number of newer Yugos can be found with automatic transmissions, and they were mostly built by request and featured a 1.3 liter engine.|$|E
25|$|Many older {{structures}} were fabricated by inserting red-hot rivets into pre-drilled holes; the soft rivets are then peened using an air hammer {{on one side}} and a bucking bar on the head end. As these cool slowly, they <b>are</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> an annealed (soft) condition, while the plate, having been hot rolled and quenched during manufacture, remains relatively hard. Under extreme stress the hard plates can shear the soft rivets, resulting in failure of the joint.|$|E
25|$|When rosé wine is {{the primary}} product, it is {{produced}} with the skin contact method. Black-skinned grapes are crushed and the skins are allowed to remain {{in contact with the}} juice for a short period, typically one to three days. The must is then pressed, and the skins are discarded rather than left in contact throughout fermentation (as with red wine making). The longer that the skins <b>are</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> contact with the juice, the more intense the color of the final wine.|$|E

Combining Canada and the United States, grizzly bears inhabit approximately half the area of their historical range.|$|E
25|$|Presently, 75 tons of {{raw sugar}} cane are {{produced}} annually per hectare in Brazil. The cane {{delivered to the}} processing plant is called burned and cropped (b), and represents 77% {{of the mass of}} the raw cane. The reason for this reduction is that the stalks are separated from the leaves (which are burned and whose ashes <b>are</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the field as fertilizer), and from the roots that remain in the ground to sprout for the next crop. Average cane production is, therefore, 58 tons of b per hectare per year.|$|E
