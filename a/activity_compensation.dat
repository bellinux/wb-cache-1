40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the StAC language and its operational semantics. StAC (Structured <b>Activity</b> <b>Compensation)</b> {{is a business}} process modelling language and a distinctive feature of the language is its support for compensation. A compensation is an action taken to recover from error or cope with a change of plan, especially when rollback of a process is not possible. StAC {{is similar to a}} process algebraic language such as Hoare’s CSP or Milner’s CCS but has additional operators dealing with compensation and with exception handling. We have developed an operational semantics for the language which is presented in this paper. ...|$|E

40|$|Extending {{the concept}} of {{transaction}} compensation The ability to compensate for previous activities, often {{in the case of}} failure or exceptional events, is an important feature of long-running business transactions. In this paper, we present several extensions to existing notions of compensation for business transactions. The extensions are described using a business process modeling language called StAC (Structured <b>Activity</b> <b>Compensation)</b> but are also placed in the context of IBM’s BPBeans (Business Process Beans) enterprise technology. The meaning of the compensation mechanisms is made precise, as are issues of compensation scoping in multilevel transactions. The compensation extensions result in flexible and powerful mechanisms for modeling and implementing long-running business transactions. To compensate is “to make amends for, to make up for. ” 1 In the context of business transactions, a compensation is an action taken when something goes wrong or when there is a change of plan. For example, when an airline has overbooked a flight and too many passengers turn up at the gate, something has gone wrong. The airline needs to take corrective action to resolve the problem. In this case, the airline will typically attempt to encourage some passengers to delay their journey by offering monetary payments. The payments and the rebooking of the flight are a compensation for the inability to seat these passengers on this flight. In this paper, we present some extensions to the standard notion of compensation. We show that these by M. Chessel...|$|E
40|$|Confirming that {{synaptic}} loss {{is directly}} related to cognitive deficit in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) {{has been the focus of}} many studies. Compensation mechanisms counteract synaptic loss and prevent the catastrophic amnesia induced by synaptic loss via maintaining the activity levels of neural circuits. Here we investigate the interplay between various synaptic degeneration and compensation mechanisms, and abnormal cortical oscillations based on a large-scale network model consisting of 100, 000 neurons exhibiting several cortical firing patterns, 8. 5 million synapses, short-term plasticity, axonal delays and receptor kinetics. The structure of the model is inspired by the anatomy of the cerebral cortex. The results of the modelling study suggest that cortical oscillations respond differently to compensation mechanisms. Local compensation preserves the baseline activity of theta (5 - 7 Hz) and alpha (8 - 12 Hz) oscillations whereas delta (1 - 4 Hz) and beta (13 - 30 Hz) oscillations are maintained via global compensation. Applying compensation mechanisms independently shows greater effects than combining both compensation mechanisms in one model and applying them in parallel. Consequently, it can be speculated that enhancing local compensation might recover the neural processes and cognitive functions that are associated with theta and alpha oscillations whereas inducing global compensation might contribute to the repair of neural (cognitive) processes which are associated with delta and beta band <b>activity.</b> <b>Compensation</b> mechanisms may vary across cortical regions and the activation of inappropriate compensation mechanism in a particular region may fail to recover network dynamics and/or induce secondary pathological changes in the network...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: There is {{considerable}} {{debate about the}} possibility of physical <b>activity</b> <b>compensation.</b> This study examined whether increased levels in physical activity and/or sedentary behavior on 1 d were predictive of lower levels in these behaviors on the following day (compensatory mechanisms) among children. Methods: Two hundred and forty-eight children (121 boys and 127 girls) age 8 – 11 yr from nine primary schools in Melbourne, Australia, wore a GT 3 X+ ActiGraph for seven consecutive days. Time spent in light physical activity (LPA) and moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) was derived using age-specific cut points. Sedentary time was defined as 100 counts per minute. Meteorological data (temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, and daylight hours) were obtained daily and matched to accelerometer wear days. Multilevel analyses (day, child, and school) were conducted using generalized linear latent and mixed models. Results: On any given day, every additional 10 min spent in MVPA was associated with approximately 25 min less LPA and 5 min less MVPA the following day. Similarly, additional time spent in LPA on any given day was associated with less time in LPA and MVPA the next day. Time spent sedentary was associated with less sedentary time the following day. Adjusting for meteorological variables did not change observed compensation effects. No significant moderating effect of sex was observed. Conclusion: The results are consistent with the compensation hypothesis, whereby children appear to compensate their physical activity or sedentary time between days. Additional adjustment for meteorological variables did not change the observed associations. Further research is needed to examine what factors may explain apparent compensatory changes in children’s physical activity and sedentary time...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The increasing evidence of associations between sedentary behaviour {{and low levels of}} physical activity in adults and both immediate and long term health implications is of public health concern. There is a need to further our understanding of adult's health behaviours, to facilitate the development of behaviour change strategies promoting healthy behaviours. This thesis provides four independent but interlinked studies focusing on adult s sedentary behaviour and physical activity in the context of measurement and behaviour change. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the thesis where the scene is set for the placement of the studies in this thesis in the field of sedentary behaviour, physical activity, and measurement methods. Chapter 2 describes a systematic review of the relationship between sedentary behaviour and physical activity in adults. This systematic review is of primary importance as it was instrumental in shaping and informing the direction of the research described in later chapters. Chapter 3 describes a laboratory study investigating the measurement of energy expenditure during common sitting and standing tasks and also examines the 1. 5 MET definition of sedentary behaviour. This study provides evidence that the 1. 5 MET threshold for sedentary behaviours seems reasonable however some sitting-based activities may be classified as non-sedentary in people of differing weight status. This study raised some important questions on the validity of objective measurement devices for differentiating between sitting and standing postures. Thus, Chapter 4 of this thesis describes a laboratory study investigating the validity of the ActiGraph inclinometer algorithms for differentiating between sitting and standing postures. Chapter 5 is an intervention investigating sedentary behavior and physical <b>activity</b> <b>compensation</b> outside working hours in a sample of office workers exposed to sit-to-stand desks in the workplace. This thesis found that light physical activity, especially standing, {{could be one of the}} most efficient and feasible behaviours to replace sedentary behaviour. Such findings add considerably to the existing literature. Targeting such facets of adults behaviour and specially office workers holds great potential for behaviour change strategies...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates ‘the doing’ of the Swedish social {{insurance}} program <b>Activity</b> <b>Compensation</b> (AC). AC {{is an example}} of disability policies in Western welfare states. These policies have two goals: to ensure financial security and to promote social participation. In 2003 AC replaced Early Retirement Pension for persons aged 19 to 29 years and who, for medical reasons, have reduced work capacity. Three features characterize AC. Young adults are differentiated in a separate system. For them, benefits are time-limited. Benefits include an established right to participate in activities. Doing AC is studied bottom-up. Interviews with two actor groups have provided the empirical base: 1) persons accorded AC and medically certified to have an anxiety and/or a depression diagnosis and 2) the respective administrator(s) at the Swedish Social Insurance Agency. National legislative preparatory texts and legal documents complete the data. The conclusions of this study are three-fold addressing goal displacement and non-contact. Firstly, a discursive change in respect to the denotation of social participation within the politics of principle has appeared throughout OECD countries over the last decennium. This goal displacement obscures the goal of economic security emphasizing the profitability of work. AC explicitly manifests this change in establishing a right to activity participation for beneficiaries. This displacement is without full impact in the politics of practice when actors’ experience of doing AC is examined. Financial security remains the foremost goal in the local politics of practice mirroring the initial function of safeguard for those with reduced work capacity due to certified illness. Relating to this lexical displacement, the study concludes that social participation is revealed as a goal to be realized in a specific form, salaried employment, within a distinct arena, the labor market. Values such as life-quality are neglected as regulatory efforts to get persons on the track to work have been underscored. Finally, the prescribed contact between the insured young adults and their administrator(s) is not consistently present. This contact is a necessary condition for the intended planning of activities to take place. When non-contact prevails, the established regulatory right to participate in activities can not materialize...|$|E

40|$|In Caenorhabditis elegans, sex {{determination}} and dosage compensation are coordinately controlled through {{a group of}} genes that respond to the primary {{sex determination}} signal. Here we describe a new gene, sdc- 3, that also controls these processes. In contrast to previously described genes, the sex determination and dosage <b>compensation</b> <b>activities</b> of sdc- 3 are separately mutable, indicating that they function independently. Paradoxically, the sdc- 3 null phenotype fails to reveal the role of sdc- 3 in sex determination: sdc- 3 null mutations that lack both <b>activities</b> disrupt dosage <b>compensation</b> but cause no overt sexual transformation. We demonstrate that the dosage compensation defect of sdc- 3 null alleles suppresses their sex determination defect. This self-suppression phenomenon provides a striking example of how a disruption in dosage compensation can affect sexual fate. We propose that the suppression occurs via a feedback mechanism that acts at an early regulatory step in the sex determination pathway to promote proper sexual identity...|$|R

40|$|Business to {{business}} integration {{has recently been}} performed by employing Web service environments. Moreover, such environments are being provided by major players on the technology markets. Those environments are based on open specifications for transaction coordination. When a failure {{in such an environment}} occurs, a compensation can be initiated to recover from the failure. However, current environments have only limited capabilities for compensations, and are usually based on backward recovery. In this paper, we introduce an engineering approach and an environment to deal with advanced compensations based on forward recovery principles. We extend the existing Web service transaction coordination architecture and infrastructure in order to support flexible compensation operations. A contract-based approach is being used, which allows the specification of permitted compensations at runtime. We introduce the abstract service and adapter components which allow us to separate the compensation logic from the coordination logic. In this way, we can easily plug in or plug out different compensation strategies based on a specification language defined on top of basic <b>compensation</b> <b>activities</b> and complex <b>compensation</b> types.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the concept, models and methods for analyzing compensation {{in the cultural}} environment. The aim is to present a theoretical basis for the discussion of compensatory activities. The discussion begins with the concept and principles for ideas about compensation in town planning. There are two different ways of seeing the need for compensating activities that {{have a negative impact}} on the landscape: On the one hand, the cultural heritage can be seen as a matter of public interest. The demand for compensation is applicable in this case for the landscape as an entity, without spatial delimitations. On the other hand, compensation measures can be directed at cultural heritage that is considered valuable by the town administration and government authorities. In this case, the demand for compensation becomes limited to objects considered to be of national interest, cultural reserves, building heritage, town planning with protection regulations or demolition bans, and local objects which are part of the national environment quality goal “Good building environment”. Both principles involve, as compared with praxis, an extensive broadening of thought about compensation when exploiting cultural environments.   Four types of <b>compensation</b> <b>activities</b> are discussed. The value of the cultural environment may be compensated when:   1. The same value, which is lost, is recreated at the same place. 2. The same value, which is lost, is recreated at another place. 3. A different value than that which is lost, is recreated at the same place. 4. A different value than that which is lost, is recreated at another place.   <b>Compensation</b> <b>activities</b> can be regulated either by agreements between the contractor/developer and the town or by decisions made by government authorities. The agreements represent a market solution. Compensation can also be the result of government decisions based on legal regulations. In town planning and urban design the actors take on different roles for compensation demands in the planning processes. An actor may take the initiative and develop suggestions for compensatory actions or may deter the recreation of the lost value. These are two active roles. The planning process also has two passive roles. An actor may revoke demands or may neglect to make a decision about a suggestion for compensation actions and hide the need for background material.   The paper ends with a discussion about the conditions for creating a systematic transfer of experience with <b>compensation</b> <b>activities.</b> A prerequisite is that the assignment to analyze the quality of the cultural heritage is complemented by following up <b>compensation</b> <b>activities.</b> QC 20141209 </p...|$|R
