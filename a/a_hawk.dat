5|$|In {{an early}} account, Sophocles wrote that Tereus {{was turned into}} a large-beaked bird whom some {{scholars}} translate as <b>a</b> <b>hawk</b> while a number of retellings and other works (including Aristophanes' ancient comedy, The Birds) hold that Tereus was instead changed into a hoopoe. Various later translations of Ovid state that Tereus was transformed into other birds than the hawk and hoopoe, including references by Dryden and Gower to the lapwing.|$|E
5|$|Montu was {{launched}} alongside Busch Gardens Tampa Bay's Egypt {{section of the}} park, which reportedly cost approximately US$20 million. With an overall theme around Egyptian mythology, the ride is named after the god of war Montu, a man depicted {{with the head of}} <b>a</b> <b>hawk.</b> When the ride was first launched, a Nile crocodile exhibit was located underneath the first section of the ride. These animals were later relocated to the park's main animal habitat.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the family}} Accipitridae, the Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{is a member}} of the large genus Accipiter, which consists of small to medium-sized woodland hawks. Most of the Old World members of the genus are called sparrowhawks or goshawks. The species' name dates back to the Middle English word sperhauk and Old English spearhafoc, <b>a</b> <b>hawk</b> which hunts sparrows. The Old Norse name for the Eurasian sparrowhawk, sparrhaukr, was thought to have been coined by Vikings who encountered falconry in England. English folk names for the Eurasian sparrowhawk include blue hawk, referring to the adult male's colouration, as well as hedge hawk, spar hawk, spur hawk and stone falcon.|$|E

5|$|Ryouta, {{searching for}} a way into the medical center basement, seeks out Nageki in the library {{to ask him about}} his death. Upon {{discovering}} documents revealing that Operation Hatoful was <b>a</b> <b>Hawk</b> Party project into developing biological weapons for use against humans using the school as an experimental facility—with a focus on a strain of H5N1 almost immediately lethal to humans dubbed the Charon virus—Nageki recalls that the fire was caused by his committing suicide by self-immolation after months of forced experimentation in order to destroy and remove any trace of the virus, which was isolated in his body, and that researchers often went in through the chemistry preparation room. Ryouta, Kazuaki, and Anghel make their way into the medical center's basement through the chemistry lab and encounter Labor 9, electrocuting it using a stun gun given to Ryouta earlier by Mister One. They confront Shuu, who imprisons Kazuaki and Anghel, leaving them to die of poison gas before leading Ryouta away. Meanwhile, San comforts Sakuya, {{and the two of them}} arrive to break Anghel and Kazuaki out of the prison.|$|E
5|$|The New South Wales waratah {{featured}} {{prominently in}} the folklore of the Darug and Tharawal people in the Sydney basin and Gandangara people to the southwest. A dreamtime legend from the Eora tells of a female wonga pigeon searching for her husband who has been lost while out hunting. <b>A</b> <b>hawk</b> attacks and wounds her, and she hides in a waratah bush. Her husband calls and as she struggles in the bush her blood turns the white waratah blooms red. A tale from the Burragorang Valley tells of a beautiful maiden named Krubi, who wore a red cloak of rock wallaby adorned with the feathers of the gang-gang cockatoo. She {{fell in love with}} a young warrior who did not return from battle. Grief-stricken, she died, and up from the ground grew the first waratah. The Dharawal people regarded it as a totem, using it in ceremonies and timing ceremonies to its flowering.|$|E
5|$|The meerkat Flower is {{born in the}} Kalahari Desert on March 15, 2000, to Holly, {{the leader}} of a meerkat group called the Whiskers. After an attack by a rival group, the Lazuli, the Whiskers are forced to {{surrender}} their territory and move to a new home. <b>A</b> <b>hawk</b> kills Holly when Flower is a year old, and her father abandons the group to find a new mate. Flower's sister Viale becomes the group's matriarch and chooses Youssarian, a roving male from the Lazuli, as her mate. Flower mates with Yossarian's brother, Zaphod, but Viale kills the resulting pups and banishes Flower from the group, allowing her to return later. During a time of starvation and drought, Viale attempts to lead the group across a road to forage. As she crosses, she is struck and killed by a passing truck. As the Whiskers attempt to adjust to the loss of their leader, a snake approaches the group. Flower steps in to lead an attack to drive it off. In doing so, she becomes the new leader of the group. Zaphod returns to the group to be her mate, while Yossarian steps aside and leaves the group. Flower leads the Whiskers back to their original home, and after a brief battle, the Whiskers reclaim it from the Lazuli. At end of the film, an on-screen note describes Flower's death during the third season of Meerkat Manor and the children she left behind.|$|E
