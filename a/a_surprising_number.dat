40|$|Proc. 5 th Intern. Workshop on Analogical and Inductive Inference for Program SynthesisThe rule-generating {{abduction}} {{is a kind}} of abduction which {{generates a}} rule and proposes a hypothesis from <b>a</b> <b>surprising</b> fact. In general, there may exist infinitely many rules and hypotheses to explain such <b>a</b> <b>surprising</b> fact. Hence, we need to put some restriction on the class of rules. In rule-generating abduction, only one surprising fact is given. Hence, we also need to generalize the concept of <b>a</b> <b>surprising</b> fact. When we deal with such generalizations, we must avoid overgeneralization. It should be determined whether or not a generalization is overgeneral by an intended model. However, it is hard to give in advance such an intended model in our rule-generating abduction. Hence, in this paper we introduce a syntactical formulation of generalization, in which it can be determined whether or not a generalization is overgeneral by the forms of atoms and substitutions. On the other hand, by the restriction of rules, it suffices to consider only two types of terms, constants and lists, and two types of substitutions with these two terms. By using the above generalizations and substitutions, we design an algorithm for rule-generating abduction, which generates rules and proposes hypotheses in polynomial time with respect to the length of <b>a</b> <b>surprising</b> fact. The <b>number</b> of rules and hypotheses is at most the number of common terms in <b>a</b> <b>surprising</b> fact. Furthermore, we show that a common term in some argument of <b>a</b> <b>surprising</b> fact also appears in the same argument of the proposed hypothesis by this algorithm...|$|R

[...] Adam Suraf of Dunkirkma.net named it the third best episode of the season. He also praised the episode's cultural references. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "There's a lovely nod to the earlier episodes in which Marge protests the citizenry's hare-brained ideas at council meetings. A series of bizarre moments rather than a story—we're especially fond of Homer's photographic memory and Mr Burns' descent into insanity—but great fun." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of A, and Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave it a score of 4 out of 5. The episode is Sarah Culp of The Quindecims eleventh-favorite episode of the show, and one of Les Winan of Box Office Prophets's favorite episodes.

30|$|Overall, <b>a</b> <b>surprising</b> high <b>number</b> of {{amino acid}} {{positions}} (41 – 59 %; Fig.  1) was identified {{to be beneficial}} for cosolvent resistance of BSLA (DMSO 59 %; DOx 41 %; TFE 41 %). The latter corresponds to 4.4 – 10.2 % of all 3620 BSLA variants in the SSM-BSLA library and convincingly explains why cosolvent improved variants can be found after screening {{of only a few}} thousand clones in a directed evolution campaign; the obtainable sequence space of BSLA is 20181. Significant differences were found among the tolerance towards the three selected cosolvents, for instance despite that more BSLA variants are found with improved DMSO cosolvent resistance, the number of variants with improvements >  2.5 -fold was 5.7 -fold higher for TFE (0.17 %) than for DMSO and DOx (0.03 %). The higher improvement factors in TFE resistance indicate significant differences in interactions between BSLA and the cosolvents TFE and DMSO/DOx. The latter indicate an unequal potential in optimizing BSLA’s tolerance against TFE and DMSO/DOx. Furthermore, the percentage of highly beneficial substitutions (>  2.5 -fold improvement) is very low and one can expect that these substitutions would rarely be found in directed evolution campaigns.|$|R

40|$|Characteristic modes (CMs) provide deep {{insight into}} the {{electromagnetic}} behaviour of any arbitrarily shaped conducting structure because the CMs are unique to the geometry of the object. We exploit this very fact by predicting <b>a</b> perhaps <b>surprising</b> <b>number</b> of important antenna metrics such as resonance frequency, radiation efficiency and antenna Q (bandwidth) without needing to specify a feeding location. In doing so, {{it is possible to}} define a collection of objective functions {{that can be used in}} an optimizer to shape-synthesize antennas without needing to define a feed location a priori. We denote this novel form of optimization “feedless” or “excitation-free” antenna shape synthesis. Fundamentally, we are allowing the electromagnetics to dictate how the antenna synthesis should proceed and are in no way imposing the physical constraints enforced by fixed feeding structures. This optimization technique is broadly applied to three major areas of antenna research: electrically small antennas, multi-band antennas and reflectarrays. Thus, the scope of applicability ranges from small antennas, to intermediate sizes and concludes with electrically large antenna designs, which is a testament to the broad applicability of characteristic mode theory. Another advantage of feedless electromagnetic shape synthesis is the ability to synthesize antennas whose desirable properties approach the fundamental limits imposed by electromagnetics. As an additional benefit, the feedless optimization technique is shown to have greater computational efficiency than traditional antenna optimization techniques...|$|R

This was the case with Edward Jerningham’s The Nunnery: an elegy in imitation of the Elegy in a Churchyard, published in 1762. Profiting by its success, Jerningham followed it up in successive years with other poems on the theme of nuns, in which the connection with Gray’s work, though less close, was maintained in theme, form and emotional tone: “The Magdalens: an elegy” (1763); “The Nun: an elegy” (1764); and “An Elegy Written Among the Ruins of an Abbey” (1765), which is derivative of the earlier poems on ruins by Moore and Cunningham.

50|$|Although he was 66 {{years old}} as the {{election}} approached, Morris-Jones’ decision to step down from Parliament at the 1950 general election may {{have been influenced by}} more than just advancing years. He was genuinely pessimistic {{about the future of the}} Liberal Party in Wales and the country at large. In a speech in Denbigh he said he doubted there would be more than 20 Independent Liberals in the next House of Commons. This is <b>a</b> slightly <b>surprising</b> <b>number</b> given that only 12 Liberal MPs had been elected in 1945, a drop of nine on the previous election and since then the party had been experiencing defections - Gwilym Lloyd-George was almost completely associated with the Conservatives by 1950 and Tom Horabin had taken the Labour whip. In fact the party continued to decline at the 1950 general election, making a net loss of three seats leaving then with only nine. Perhaps Morris-Jones also foresaw the final absorption of the National Liberals into the Conservative Party. The formal merger of the two parties had already taken place in 1948 and from then on, it was only a matter of time before any remaining genuinely Liberal element was subsumed by the overwhelming numbers and philosophy of the Conservatives, something which given his Liberal past and strong convictions, Morris-Jones may well have regretted.
