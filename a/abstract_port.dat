40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> <b>Porting</b> on grids complex MPI {{applications}} involving collective communications requires significant program modification, usually {{dedicated to}} a single grid structure. The difficulty comes from the mismatch between programs organizations and grid structures: 1) large grids are hierarchical structures aggregating parallel machines through an interconnection network, decided at runtime and 2) the MPI standard does not currently provide any specific information for topology-aware applications, so almost all MPI applications have been developed following a non-hierarchical and non-flexible vision. In this paper, we propose a generic programming method and a modification of the MPI runtime environment to make MPI applications topology aware. In contrary to previous approaches, topology requirements for the application are given to the grid scheduling system, which exposes the compatible allocated topology to the application. ...|$|R

This is usually done manually through code inspections. We propose a type inference algorithm able to infer basic {{information about the}} library functions a particular C program uses {{in the absence of}} declaration information for the library (e. g., without header files). Based on a simple but efficient inference algorithm, we were able to infer declarations for much of the PalmOS API from the source of a twenty-seven-thousand-line C program. Such a tool will aid in the problem of program understanding when porting programs, especially from poorly-documented or lost legacy environments. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> <b>Port</b> {{knocking}} is {{a technique}} first introduced in the blackhat and trade literature to prevent attackers from discovering and exploiting potentially vulnerable services on a network host, while allowing authenticated users to access these services. Despite being based on some sound principles and being a potentially useful tool, most {{work in this area}} suffers from a lack of a clear threat model or motivation. We introduce a formal security model for port knocking that addresses these issues, show how previous schemes fail to meet our definition, and give a provably secure scheme that uses steganographic embedding of pseudorandom message authentication codes. We also describe the design and analysis of SILENTKNOCK, an implementation of this protocol for the Linux 2. 6 operating system, that is provably secure, under the assumption that AES and a modified version of MD 4 are pseudorandom functions, and integrates seamlessly with any existing application, with no need to recompile. Experiments indicate that the overhead due to running SILENTKNOCK on a server is minimal – on the order of 150 μs per TCP connection initiation. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> <b>Port</b> Curtis is {{a rapidly}} growing industrialised and urbanised harbour in Central Queensland, Australia. The spatial {{variability}} of trace metals in waters and suspended particulates was determined along axial transects within the harbour and in oceanic waters adjacent to Port Curtis. Dissolved metal concentrations were significantly elevated in Port Curtis compared with the concentrations measured in the adjacent coastal waters. Dissolved copper and zinc concentrations ranged from < 19 to 800 and < 31 to 580 ng L− 1, respectively, and maxima were observed in inner harbour waters adjacent to the southern entrance to the Narrows and {{in close proximity to}} anthropogenic sources. Dissolved nickel concentrations were measured in the range of 110 to 900 ng L− 1, and exhibited a maximum concentration in the central to northern Narrows, in an area that was not adjacent to anthropogenic sources. Dissolved manganese concentration maxima were measured in close proximity to the dissolved nickel maxima. It appears likely that the elevated dissolved metal concentrations in Port Curtis and the Narrows were not caused by a single point source, and are the result of several factors, including industrial activity around the foreshore, fluxes from sediment-porewater, low flushing durations, lower water pH and possibly episodic inputs from adjacent rivers...|$|E

Since writing parallel code by hand is time consuming and costly, porting codes would ideally be automated by using some parallelization tools and compilers. In this paper, we compare {{the performance of}} three parallelization tools and compilers based on the NAS Parallel Benchmark and a CFD application, ARC 3 D, on the SGI Origin 2000 multiprocessor. The tools and compilers compared include: 1) CAPTools: an interactive computer aided parallelization toolkit, 2) Portland Group’s HPF compiler, and 3) the MIPSPro FORTRAN compiler available on the Origin 2000, with support for shared memory multiprocessing directives and MP runtime library. The tools and compilers are evaluated in four areas: 1) required user interaction, 2) limitations, 3) portability and 4) performance. Based on these results, a discussion on the feasibility of computer-aided parallelization of aerospace applications is presented along with suggestions for future work. ...|$|R

In this paper, we perform the first large-scale security comparison between mobile and desktop browsers. We focus our efforts on display security given the inherent screen limi-tations of mobile phones. We evaluate display elements in ten mobile, three tablet and five desktop browsers. We identify two new classes of vulnerabilities specific to mobile browsers and demonstrate their risk by launching real-world attacks including display ballooning, login CSRF and clickjacking. Additionally, we im-plement a new phishing attack that exploits a default policy in mobile browsers. These previously unknown vulnerabilities have been confirmed by browser ven-dors. Our observations, inputs from browser vendors and the pervasive nature of the discovered vulnerabilities illustrate that new implementation errors leading to serious attacks are introduced when browser software is ported from the desk-top to mobile environment. We conclude that usability considerations are crucial while designing mobile solutions and display security in mobile browsers is not comparable to that in desktop browsers. ...|$|R

If subpopulations are evident, then phenotypic variation among groups should result in differences in life-history parameters. The present study tested for patterns of spatial variability of life-history parameters among regional Port Jackson shark populations. Rates of growth from Port Jackson sharks caught in the gulf waters of South Australia were calculated {{on the basis of}} counts of vertebral increments. Growth parameters were obtained by fitting the length-at-age data to von Bertalanffy and Gompertz growth functions. While the derived growth curves fit the length-atage data well (r 2 ranged from 0. 87 to 0. 91), parameters showed considerable differences between the two functions, with the von Bertalanffy function providing the more realistic estimates of growth (combined sexes: k 0. 081 year 1, LN 1232 mm total length and t 0 1. 937 years). Life-history parameters for South Australian Port Jackson sharks were collated with the available data for the species, facilitating comparisons among regional populations. Growth curves among populations varied significantly; however, considerable overlap in the length ranges of size at birth and sizes at maturity among populations were evident. Overall, the data presented here do not provide definitive support for the presence of subpopulations across the distribution of the Port Jackson shark, suggesting that molecular analysis maybe required to directly test for structuring...|$|E

40|$|<b>Abstract</b> <b>Ports</b> are complex, multiple-stakeholder environments {{representing}} the entrance point of intercontinental sea shipments into a country. Because ports are areaswhere {{large amounts of}} goods converge, they play a strategic role in a country’s securityand economic sustenance. Consequently different stakeholders interact to ensure thatcargo handling operations are optimized and cost-effective, e. g. international shipping,logistics companies, trading communities, and regulatory bodies. In this context securitythreats assume a special relevance, since ports could be exploited by criminal organizations to smuggle illicit goods into a country or by terrorists planning an attack. Toeliminate or mitigate these risks human resources need to be correctly trained andeducated. In addition, the competent authorities need {{to ensure that the}} same level andquality of training is delivered to all port facilities providing access to a country or acontinent. Unfortunately, experts believe that in the EU {{there is a lack of}} harmonizationof courses and quality assurance systems. Hence, the aim of this study is to reviewexisting regulatory frameworks and assess whether guidance is provided to harmonizesecurity training and education in port facilities.

Many networks deploy Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) to detect port scans in real-time. However, most NIDS are perflow based. They are not scalable on high speed links since it is infeasible to maintain the states of numerous flows. In this paper, we propose a scalable scheme for real-time port scan detection without keeping any per-flow state. We use a doublefilter structure to find out pairs which connect to more than N pairs in T time. The experimental results on real network traces show that our scheme can find out those over-threshold pairs with high accuracy. It is easy to scale our scheme to high speed environments due to its little memory consumption and fast processing pipeline. I...|$|R

40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> Well-known <b>port</b> numbers can {{no longer}} be used to {{reliably}} identify network applications. There is a variety of new Internet applications that either do not use well-known port numbers or use other protocols, such as HTTP, as wrappers in order to go through firewalls without being blocked. One consequence of this is that a simple inspection of the port numbers used by flows may lead to the inaccurate classification of network traffic. In this work, we look at these inaccuracies in detail. Using a full payload packet trace collected from an Internet site we attempt to identify the types of errors that may result from portbased classification and quantify them for the specific trace under study. To address this question we devise a classification methodology that relies on the full packet payload. We describe the building blocks of this methodology and elaborate on the complications that arise in that context. A classification technique approaching 100 % accuracy proves to be a labor-intensive process that needs to test flow-characteristics against multiple classification criteria in order to gain sufficient confidence {{in the nature of the}} causal application. Nevertheless, the benefits gained from a content-based classification approach are evident. We are capable of accurately classifying what would be otherwise classified as unknown as well as identifying traffic flows that could otherwise be classified incorrectly. Our work opens up multiple research issues that we intend to address in future work. ...|$|R

O. Box 625, SE- 405 30 Gothenburg, Sweden. (Written in English.) Distribution: Department of Economy and Society (address as above). This dissertation {{consists of an}} introduction and four research papers that connect with two broad research fields: economic growth and labour market conflicts. In the introduction I provide a theoretical framework and I elaborate on the methods and material used in the papers. In Paper 1, I investigate the topic of inter-industry propensity to strike. Earlier {{research has suggested that}} some groups of workers have struck more than others. One such group is dock workers—known within labour history and industrial relations for their militancy across time and space. But as shown in the paper, there is no empirical evidence for the particular strike-proneness of dockers up to WWII. Port strikes seem to have been not so much a quantitative as a qualitative phenomenon: the position of dockers in the distribution chain gave them the potential to disrupt society to a degree far exceeding most other occupational groups. In Paper 2, co-author Christer Thörnqvist and I study the 1909 Swedish General Strike. The strike was not powerful enough, and the trade unions and the Swedish Trade Union Confederation, LO, met a crushing defeat. Our focus is the functioning of the transportation system—and the ports in particular—an aspect of vital outcome for the strike, but one which is underdeveloped in previous research. We make the argument that LO did little or nothing to support the strikers in the ports, and that export could continue with the assistance of strikebreakers. One of the factors explaining LO’s disinterest in port affairs was its overall strategy to respect the laws of the state; {{at the time it was}} a crime to even try to force someone to strike, or in any way prevent someone from working. In Paper 3, I examine technology and productivity in the pre-container Port of Gothenburg. I argue that technological change was gradual for a long period of time and that the forklift and pallet—adopted in the late 1940 s—were responsible for setting off a series of changes. The productivity figures I present strongly indicate growth up to WWII —an empirical finding that contrasts with results from other ports. In the postwar years productivity continued to grow, but at a faster rate compared to the prewar years. The pattern of productivity offers tentative support for the contention that the impact of the forklift was revolutionary. In Paper 4, I discuss the transformation of the Swedish labour market in the first half of the twentieth century: from high to low levels of conflict activity. I critically evaluate the power resources hypothesis, saying that the seizing of governmental power by social democrats in the 1930 s gave the working class opportunity to shift focus: from costly strikes within the industrial sphere to less costly redistributive policies within the political sphere. As an alternative explanation I emphasize intra-labour tensions. Communism, syndicalism and social democracy showed diverse attitudes towards industrial militancy, and the relative strength of the three ideologies affected conflict activity accordingly...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Remote {{procedure}} call (RPC) {{is a technique}} that has been largely adopted by distributed services. This technique, now more and more used {{in the context of}} high-performance computing (HPC), allows the execution of routines to be delegated to remote nodes, which can be set aside and dedicated to specific tasks. However, existing RPC frameworks assume a socket-based network interface (usually on top of TCP/IP), which is not appropriate for HPC systems, because this API does not typically map well to the native network transport used on those systems, resulting in lower network performance. In addition, existing RPC frameworks often do not support handling large data arguments, such as those found in read or write calls. We present in this paper an asynchronous RPC interface, called Mercury, specifically designed for use in HPC systems. The interface allows asynchronous transfer of parameters and execution requests and provides direct support of large data arguments. Mercury is generic in order to allow any function call to be shipped. Additionally, the network implementation is <b>abstracted,</b> allowing easy <b>porting</b> to future systems and efficient use of existing native transport mechanisms. I...|$|R
