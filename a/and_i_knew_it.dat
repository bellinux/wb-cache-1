500|$|According to the Church of Scientology, [...] "even some {{fifty years}} later, those who sailed with Mr. Hubbard in 1932 would still speak of that voyage {{as the one}} grand {{adventure}} in the twilight of their youth." [...] Hubbard put it somewhat differently, writing in 1935 that the expedition [...] "was a crazy idea at best, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it,</b> but I went ahead anyway, chartered a four-masted schooner and embarked with some fifty luckless souls who haven't stopped their cursings yet." [...] He told Look magazine in 1950 that the Caribbean Motion Picture Expedition [...] "was a two-bit expedition and financial bust, and I quit the ship at Puerto Rico in 1933." [...] The collapse of the expedition led a number of its members to make legal claims against Hubbard for refunds.|$|E
500|$|Hubbard {{blamed the}} expedition's {{problems}} on the captain: [...] "the ship's dour Captain Garfield proved himself far less than a Captain Courageous, requiring Ron Hubbard's hand at both the helm and the charts." [...] Specimens and photographs collected by the expedition are said by Scientology accounts to have been acquired by the University of Michigan, the U.S. Hydrographic Office, an unspecified national museum and the New York Times, though none of those institutions have any record of this. Hubbard later wrote that the expedition [...] "was a crazy idea at best, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it,</b> but I went ahead anyway, chartered a four-masted schooner and embarked with some fifty luckless souls who haven't stopped their cursings yet." [...] He called it [...] "a two-bit expedition and financial bust", which resulted in some of its participants making legal claims against him for refunds.|$|E

500|$|Costume {{designer}} Michele Clapton designed most of {{the newly}} introduced costumes and jewelry in [...] "The Winds of Winter". Clapton had initially left the series, but returned for the final two episodes of the season to design four different costumes. In an interview, Michele Clapton spoke about the process and meaning behind Cersei Lannister's gown and crown in the season finale. Clapton stated that she had four to five weeks to create the gown, but once she received the script for the episode, she was [...] "immediately sure" [...] of how the dress should look. She stated in the interview, [...] "I {{knew it had to}} be leather <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> had to be linked to Tywin. I wanted a distinct, strong silhouette, so I squared her shoulders. I also wanted the dress to skim her ankles, so that you could see her feet—again, strength. The silver shoulders are decorated in a similar manner to Jaime's gold hand—the one person that she still has something with." [...] Clapton also noted that every part of the dress represents something, saying, [...] "There is no 'decoration' to Cersei." [...] She stated that she additionally chose to make the dress black in order to represent mourning, as well as a [...] "deadness inside her." ...|$|E
500|$|Bernthal was {{extremely}} comfortable with his character on set. [...] "The second {{he opened his}} mouth and started reading the scene, I knew it was him," [...] he said. [...] "There was no question. I saw Frank <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it.</b> He's the guy. He's a wonderful actor, and he's going to kill it in this role." [...] Bernthal admitted that he had no prior knowledge of The Walking Dead. He reminisced that he reacted so [...] "organically" [...] to the script that he [...] "didn't want to be colored by anything else. When I did read the comic, I was shocked. Look, I'm not going to sit here and regret. One {{of the great things about}} doing TV versus film is to be surprised yourself, to not let where you're going color where you are." [...] The pilot episode's script was amongst several other scripts for proposed television pilots that Bernthal skimmed through; He felt that this script overshadowed the others. [...] " [...] pilot season, and I read everything that was out there. I still remember the day that I got this script. I told my agent that I'd be thrilled to be an extra in this, it's so good. It just blew the rest of them right out of the water." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at Power Station Studio in New York at a quick pace. Rodgers {{enlisted the help}} of his former Chic bandmates Edwards, who was the bassist, and Tony Thompson, who played the drums; they appeared on several tracks of the album. Rodgers decided to be the guitarist, when Edwards requested him to do so, in exchange for their help. The recording sessions did not start until the afternoon as Rodgers, who attended late-night parties, was not accustomed to work in early mornings. The schedule was also difficult for Madonna, who recalled that she used to [...] "go to the swim club on the Upper West Side and go swimming and walk from there to the recording studio. It was impossible for me to reach there at morning." [...] Rodgers recalled that Madonna was a real hard worker and incredibly tenacious. He commented: [...] "I am always amazed by Madonna's incredible judgement {{when it comes to making}} pop records. I've never seen anyone do it better, and that's the truth. When we did that album, it was the perfect union, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> from the first day in the studio. The thing between us, man, it was sexual, it was passionate, it was creativity... it was pop." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{hospital}} corpsman and sniper of a four-man reconnaissance {{and surveillance}} team, SEAL Team 10. Wahlberg {{was the first}} actor to sign on as a star of the film during its early stages of development. He agreed to portray Luttrell after reading Peter Berg's script. Wahlberg chose not to read Luttrell's book Lone Survivor during production to avoid arguments with Berg over events and details that were {{left out in the}} book. [...] "The problem when adapting a piece of material like that is that you always feel like something is missing", he explained. [...] "I wanted to come at it from this perspective." [...] Of Wahlberg's portrayal, Luttrell stated, [...] "Wahlberg is a consummate professional, and he's a great actor. It was a little strange watching somebody trying to play me, but we talked about it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> would turn out great. I was more worried about the other guys because they’re not around to speak for themselves." [...] Wahlberg has since cited Lone Survivor as his favorite film role as an actor and producer: [...] "This is the best working experience I’ve ever had, under the toughest conditions. I remember early on as an actor, you worked a long, hard day, but you did something you felt was special, and that car ride home you couldn’t stop thinking about it. I had that feeling every day on this movie." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{month after}} the Gomez fight, it was {{announced}} that Jorge Rubio would become Khan's new trainer. Rubio was chosen because Khan thought that he had very good chemistry with the Cuban trainer. Khan said, [...] "Rubio was showing me all these new training techniques, and I felt so comfortable because it suited my style. I knew I had the hand speed and the footwork to do it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was going to make me a much better fighter".|$|E

[...] At the end of three periods we were tied 7–7 <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> couldn't last. I knew sooner or later Army would overpower us. And that's what happened.

2500|$|Wallace's {{adventure}} {{story is}} told {{from the perspective of}} Judah Ben-Hur. On occasion, the author speaks directly to his readers. Wallace understood that Christians would be skeptical of a fictional story on Christ's life, so he was careful not to offend them in his writing. Ben-Hur [...] "maintains a respect for the underlying principles of Judaism and Christianity". In his memoirs, Wallace wrote:The Christian world would not tolerate a novel with Jesus Christ its hero, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> ... He should not be present as an actor in any scene of my creation. The giving a cup of water to Ben-Hur at the well near Nazareth is the only violation of this rule ... I would be religiously careful that every word He uttered should be a literal quotation from one of His sainted biographers.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his early}} career, Ó Domhnaill played a dark journeyman's Guild {{dreadnought}} guitar {{on stage and}} on recordings. In 1977, he commissioned a custom-made guitar from luthier Kenny White who was based out of Portland, Oregon. During the 1990s, he played a 1975 Martin D-28, which he used on his later recordings and stage appearances. In a 1996 interview, Ó Domhnaill observed, [...] "It's gotten louder, fuller, clearer, and more bell-like. It wasn't a great instrument when I bought it, {{but it was a}} Martin, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> would improve if I played it. I have, and it's worked." [...] Ó Domhnaill also owned a custom-made guitar by another Portland luthier Terry Demezas. He preferred medium-gauge phosphor-bronze strings, and used a large triangular Fender medium flatpick when not fingerpicking. For much of his career, he performed with a small quiver of tin whistles and a pedal harmonium.|$|E
2500|$|On 29 January 2005 it was {{announced}} {{after a lot of}} speculation that Ryan, along with Kim Medcalf (Sam), would be leaving. A source for the show said, [...] "Michelle [...] has made no secret of her plans to leave the soap in recent months. Despite her character being at the centre of some of the show's biggest storylines, the actress is now considering a modelling career." [...] The source added, [...] "Michelle is hot property and has been inundated with offers of other acting work. She's also had several offers of lucrative modelling projects." [...] Speaking about her decision to quit she told The Sun,Everyone knew {{it was time for me}} to go <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was time for me to move on."Then Jessie , who plays my screen mum Kat, said, 'You're young, so get out there.

2500|$|The {{shooting}} of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old African American boy (June 25, 2002 – November 23, 2014), occurred on November 22, 2014, in Cleveland, Ohio. Two police officers, 26-year-old Timothy Loehmann and 46-year-old Frank Garmback, responded {{after receiving a}} police dispatch call of a black male that [...] "keeps pulling a gun out of his pants and pointing it at people". A caller reported that a male was pointing [...] "a pistol" [...] at random people in the Cudell Recreation Center. At {{the beginning of the}} call and again in the middle he says of the pistol [...] "it's probably fake". [...] Toward the end of the two-minute call, the caller stated [...] "he is probably a juvenile". However, this information was not relayed to Loehmann or Garmback on the initial dispatch. The officers reported that upon their arrival, they both continuously yelled [...] "show me your hands" [...] through the open patrol car window. [...] Loehmann further claimed that instead of showing his hands, it appeared as if Rice was trying to draw the replica: [...] "I knew it was a gun <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was coming out". In response, the officer shot twice, hitting Rice once in the torso. He died on the following day.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2014, Derby {{rejected}} {{an offer}} from Burnley for Bryson. Bryson was however given permission to speak to Burnley, later saying that [...] "it doesn't matter what team it is, when someone puts an offer in for you I think you owe them the respect {{to sit down and}} speak to them... but just because I did that didn't mean I was going to sign for them." [...] Soon afterwards, he agreed a new five-year contract with Derby, saying that his bond with the fans was {{part of the reason that}} he chose to stay: [...] "I've got a good bond with the fans as well and that was a big part in my decision to stay here. The fans have been excellent ever since I walked through the door. When you come to a new club it can take time to win over the fans, but they have been fantastic with me... they helped me make the biggest decision of my career, if not my life. I took a while to think about it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> would be a massive decision. I went through stages where one minute I thought I was leaving and then the next minute I think I'm staying. But in the end it turned out to be an easy decision for me because Derby are such a great club to be part of." ...|$|E
