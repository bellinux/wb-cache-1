5|$|Værøy Airport {{was plagued}} by bad wind {{conditions}} and low regularity. The airport had {{the highest number of}} cancellations in the country, with 31 of 609 flights canceled in the first eleven months of operation. During some periods, regularity was as low as 50%. The navigational aids were moved in 1989 to increase safety, more runway lights were installed and an anemometer was installed on the mountain, costing NOK1 million. Widerøe introduced self-imposed restrictions on landing at Værøy from 31 October 1988. Aircraft were not allowed to land or take off if the wind came from 090°–240° (though south) if the wind speed exceeded , including gusts. <b>Additional</b> <b>restriction</b> were introduced following an incident on 18 January 1989. These were again modified on 1 November 1989.|$|E
25|$|By this {{is meant}} that Coxeter {{diagrams}} of finite groups correspond to point groups generated by reflections, while Dynkin diagrams must satisfy an <b>additional</b> <b>restriction</b> {{corresponding to the}} crystallographic restriction theorem, and that Coxeter diagrams are undirected, while Dynkin diagrams are (partly) directed.|$|E

The linear fractional transformation, also known as a Möbius transformation, has many fascinating properties. Four of these are of primary importance in developing the analytic theory of continued fractions.|$|E
2500|$|This can {{be proven}} by {{comparing}} the restrictions on (undirected) Dynkin diagrams with the restrictions on Coxeter diagrams of finite groups: formally, the Coxeter graph {{can be obtained from}} the Dynkin diagram by discarding the direction of the edges, and replacing every double edge with an edge labelled 4 and every triple edge by an edge labelled 6. Also note that every finitely generated Coxeter group is an Automatic group. Dynkin diagrams have the <b>additional</b> <b>restriction</b> that the only permitted edge labels are 2, 3, 4, and 6, which yields the above. Geometrically, this corresponds to the crystallographic restriction theorem, and the fact that excluded polytopes do not fill space or tile the plane – for [...] the dodecahedron (dually, icosahedron) does not fill space; for [...] the 120-cell (dually, 600-cell) does not fill space; for [...] a p-gon does not tile the plane except for [...] or [...] (the triangular, square, and hexagonal tilings, respectively).|$|E
