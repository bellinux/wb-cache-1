5|$|The {{problems}} of tomb construction {{can be seen}} with tombs of Ramesses III and his father Setnakhte. Setnakhte started to excavate KV11 but broke into the tomb of Amenmesse, so construction was abandoned and he instead usurped the tomb of Twosret, KV14. When looking for a tomb, Ramesses III extended the partly-excavated tomb started by his father. The tomb of Ramesses II returned to an early style, with <b>a</b> <b>bent</b> axis, {{probably due to the}} quality of the rock being excavated (following the Esna shale).|$|E

5|$|Although {{there were}} various small incidents, three major {{accidents}} {{led to a}} red flag for the session. The No. 13 Courage Compétition entry, driven by Guillaume Moreau, went off at the Porsche Curves during the second hour. The car could {{not return to the}} test session due <b>a</b> <b>bent</b> chassis caused by the heavy impact. The second red flag involved the No. 24 Noël del Bello entry going off the track at the same location in the hands of Vitaly Petrov, becoming briefly airborne after contact with the concrete wall. In the final incident, almost in the last hour of the session, the No. 10 Arena Motorsports Zytek also went off at the Porsche Curves, and briefly caught fire.|$|E
5|$|By 14 August Ohio {{was stopped}} with {{no hope of}} getting her engines going {{as she had been}} hit again whilst in tow of Penn. As Ledbury {{approached}} the estimated position of the tanker, the destroyer could find no sign of her. A little later, Commander Hill sighted gunfire ahead, and considering it to be Ohios escorts beating off reconnaissance snoops, the destroyer turned course towards the flashes on the horizon. As Ledbury approached Ohio, it was seen that the tanker was lying deep in the water, with <b>a</b> <b>bent</b> line of deck. Here, Hill turned towards his number one and said ' It looks as though we're too late '.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian shadow clocks divided daytime into 12 {{parts with}} each part further divided into more precise parts. One type of shadow clock {{consisted}} of a long stem with five variable marks and an elevated crossbar which cast a shadow over those marks. It was positioned eastward in the morning, and was turned west at noon. Obelisks functioned {{in much the same}} manner: the shadow cast on the markers around it allowed the Egyptians to calculate the time. The obelisk also indicated whether it was morning or afternoon, as well as the summer and winter solstices. A third shadow clock, developed c. 1500, was similar in shape to <b>a</b> <b>bent</b> T-square. It measured the passage of time by the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. The T was oriented eastward in the mornings, and turned around at noon, so that it could cast its shadow in the opposite direction.|$|E

5|$|Hearing {{the shark}} has been lured into the pipe, Michael and Kay {{go down to}} repair the {{underwater}} tunnel, so the technicians can restore air pressure and drain the water. Calvin orders the pump {{to be shut down}} to suffocate the shark, but this act instead allows her to break free from the pipe and attack Michael and Kay, but they are saved by the dolphins. They make their way back to the control room, but the shark appears {{in front of the window}} and smashes through the glass, flooding the room and killing a technician. Michael notices FitzRoyce's corpse still in the shark's throat with a grenade, and uses <b>a</b> <b>bent</b> pole to pull its pin, triggering the grenade's explosion and killing the shark. In the aftermath, Mike and Kay celebrate with the dolphins, who survived their brush with the shark.|$|E
5|$|When {{the outer}} walls {{were built in}} the 13thcentury the main {{entrance}} was enhanced. A vaulted corridor led uphill from the outer gate in the northeast. The corridor made a hairpin turn halfway along its length, making it an example of <b>a</b> <b>bent</b> entrance. Bent entrances were a Byzantine innovation, but that at Krak des Chevaliers was a particularly complex example. It extended for , and along its length were murder-holes which allowed defenders to shower attackers with missiles. Anyone going straight ahead rather than following the hairpin turn would emerge in the area between the castle's two circuits of walls. To access the inner ward, the passage had to be followed round.|$|E

The use of the papal ferula is an ancient custom, established before the thirteenth century, though some popes since that time, notably Pope Leo XIII, have used a crozier-like staff.|$|E

25|$|Ozone is <b>a</b> <b>bent</b> triatomic {{molecule}} {{with three}} vibrational modes: the symmetric stretch (1103.157cm−1), bend (701.42cm−1) and antisymmetric stretch (1042.096cm−1). The symmetric stretch and bend are weak absorbers, but the antisymmetric stretch {{is strong and}} responsible for ozone being an important minor greenhouse gas. This IR band {{is also used to}} detect ambient and atmospheric ozone although UV based measurements are more common.|$|E
25|$|Pila were {{designed}} to penetrate both shield and armour, wounding the wearer; but, if they simply stuck in a shield, they could not easily be removed. The iron shank would bend upon impact, weighing down the enemy's shield and also preventing the pilum from being immediately re-used. The shaft would also fall off on impact, leaving the enemy with <b>a</b> <b>bent</b> shank in their shield.|$|E
