5|$|By {{the end of}} U.S. {{military}} operations in Iraq in December 2011, several Apache helicopters had been shot down by enemy fire, and others lost in accidents. In 2006, an Apache was downed by a Soviet-made Strela 2 (SA-7) in Iraq, despite the Apache being typically able to avoid such missiles. In 2007, four Apache helicopters were destroyed on the ground by insurgent mortar fire using web-published geotagged photographs taken by soldiers. Several AH-64s were lost to accidents in <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>as</b> of 2012. Most Apaches that took heavy damage were able to continue their missions and return safely.|$|E

In August 2007, Canada's territorial claims in the Arctic were challenged after a Russian underwater expedition to the North Pole; Canada has considered that area to be sovereign territory since 1925.|$|E

The 1st Commando Regiment contributed forces to several other Special Operations Task Group rotations.|$|E
5|$|Since reunification, Germany {{has taken}} {{a more active role}} in the European Union. Together with its European {{partners}} Germany signed the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, established the Eurozone in 1999, and signed the Lisbon Treaty in 2007. Germany sent a peacekeeping force to secure stability in the Balkans and sent a force of German troops to <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>as</b> part of a NATO effort to provide security in that country after the ousting of the Taliban. These deployments were controversial since Germany is bound by domestic law only to deploy troops for defence roles.|$|E

Donna entered the series as a staff nurse, characterised as a wild-child with a chaotic personal life. During her tenure, she grew to take her work more seriously, becoming a ward sister and accepting more personal responsibilities by adopting her half-niece Mia (Jada Wallace-Mitchell).

5|$|Following the 11 September 2001 attacks, {{elements}} of the division, including its special troops battalion and the 1-87th Infantry deployed to <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>as</b> part of Operation Enduring Freedom in late 2001. The division headquarters arrived at Karshi-Khanabad, under Major General Hagenbeck, on 12 December 2001 to function as the Combined Forces Land Component Command (CFLCC) (Forward). This command served as the representative for Lieutenant General Paul Mikolashek, the Third US Army/CFLCC commanding general (CG) in the theater of operations. As such, Hagenbeck's headquarters was responsible for commanding and controlling virtually all Coalition ground forces and ground force operations in the theater, to include security of Coalition airfields in Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, and Pakistan, {{as well as the}} logistics operations set up to support those forces.|$|E

In the spring of 2007, the 173d ABCT again deployed to <b>Afghanistan,</b> <b>as</b> Task Force Bayonet, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF 07–09), their first deployment as a fully transformed brigade combat team.

A Soviet-organized government, led by Parcham's Babrak Karmal but {{inclusive}} of both factions, filled the vacuum. Soviet troops were deployed to stabilize Afghanistan under Karmal in more substantial numbers, although the Soviet government {{did not expect to}} do most of the fighting in <b>Afghanistan.</b> <b>As</b> a result, however, the Soviets were now directly involved in what had been a domestic war in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|The ADF's {{increased}} activities since 1999 and shortfalls {{in recruiting}} permanent personnel {{has led to}} reservists being more frequently called to active service.

Large numbers of reserve personnel have also been deployed as part of ADF operations in Australia's region; this has included the deployment of Army Reserve rifle companies to East Timor and the Solomon Islands. Smaller numbers of reservists have taken part in operations in locations distant from Australia. Notably, companies of the Army Reserve 1st Commando Regiment were regularly deployed to <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>as</b> part of the Special Operations Task Group.|$|E
