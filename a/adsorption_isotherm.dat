25|$|In other instances, {{molecular}} {{interactions between}} gas molecules previously adsorbed on a solid surface form significant interactions with gas molecules in the gaseous phases. Hence, adsorption of gas molecules {{to the surface}} {{is more likely to}} occur around gas molecules that are already present on the solid surface, rendering the Langmuir <b>adsorption</b> <b>isotherm</b> ineffective for the purposes of modelling. This effect was studied in a system where nitrogen was the adsorbate and tungsten was the adsorbent by Paul Kisliuk (1922–2008) in 1957. To compensate for the increased probability of adsorption occurring around molecules present on the substrate surface, Kisliuk developed the precursor state theory, whereby molecules would enter a precursor state at the interface between the solid adsorbent and adsorbate in the gaseous phase. From here, adsorbate molecules would either adsorb to the adsorbent or desorb into the gaseous phase. The probability of adsorption occurring from the precursor state is dependent on the adsorbate’s proximity to other adsorbate molecules that have already been adsorbed. If the adsorbate molecule in the precursor state is in close proximity to an adsorbate molecule that has already formed on the surface, it has a sticking probability reflected {{by the size of the}} SE constant and will either be adsorbed from the precursor state at a rate of kEC or will desorb into the gaseous phase at a rate of kES. If an adsorbate molecule enters the precursor state at a location that is remote from any other previously adsorbed adsorbate molecules, the sticking probability is reflected by the size of the SD constant.|$|E

2500|$|Adsorbate {{molecules}} adsorb readily {{because they}} lower the surface free-energy of the substrate and are stable {{due to the}} strong chemisorption of the [...] "head groups." [...] These bonds create monolayers that are more stable than the physisorbed bonds of Langmuir–Blodgett films. A Trichlorosilane based [...] "head group", for example in a FDTS molecule, reacts with an hydroxyl group on a substrate, and forms very stable, covalent bond [...] with an energy of 452 kJ/mol. Thiol-metal bonds [...] are {{on the order of}} 100 kJ/mol, making them fairly stable in a variety of temperatures, solvents, and potentials.
