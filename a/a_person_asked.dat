500|$|Although Kertész rarely {{received}} bad reviews, it was {{the lack}} of commentary that lead to the photographer feeling distant from recognition. Now, however, he is often considered to be the father of photojournalism. Even other photographers cite Kertész and his photographs as being inspirational; Henri Cartier-Bresson once said of him in the early 1930s, [...] "We all owe him a great deal." [...] When he was 90 years old, <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>asked</b> him why he was still taking photographs. He replied, [...] "I'm still hungry." ...|$|E

And as [...] required that they remove everything that he had in his house, including his axes and his sieves, the people would see his possessions and exclaim how selfish he had been.|$|E
5000|$|Principles of self-injury {{are applied}} to more than just one's self. It is {{noteworthy}} that <b>a</b> <b>person</b> may not request or hire an agent to injure themselves: it is forbidden to waive the rule against self-injury or to abet self-injury to one's own body. The Mishnah states: [...] "If <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>asks,</b> 'Blind my eye', or 'cut off my hand' or 'break my leg,' anyone who does so is liable (for violating injury law) -- even if <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>asking</b> to be injured stipulates that anyone who does so would be exempt, the one who causes injury would still be liable. Likewise, if <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>asks,</b> 'Tear my clothes' or break my pitcher' then anyone who does so is liable; however, if <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>asking</b> for their property to be damages stipulates that anyone who does so would be exempt, then the exemption is valid."

2500|$|Voters {{were split}} {{as to who}} won the first presidential debate. Bush {{improved}} in the second debate. Before the second debate, Dukakis had been suffering from the flu and {{spent much of the}} day in bed. His performance was poor and played to his reputation as being intellectually cold. Reporter Bernard Shaw asked Dukakis whether he would support the death penalty if his wife were raped and murdered; Dukakis's answer discussed the statistical ineffectiveness of capital punishment. Several commentators thought the question itself was unfair, in that it injected an irrelevant emotional element into the discussion of a policy issue, but many observers felt Dukakis's answer lacked the normal emotions one would expect of <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>asked</b> about a loved one's rape and death. Tom Brokaw of NBC reported on his October 14 newscast, [...] "The consensus tonight is that Vice President George Bush won last night's debate and made it all the harder for Governor Michael Dukakis to catch and pass him in the 25 days remaining. In all of the Friday morning quarterbacking, there was common agreement that Dukakis failed to seize the debate and make it his night." ...|$|E
6000|$|Presently <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>asked</b> {{to speak}} with Mr. Sandbrook; and supposing it was on {{business}} connected with the funeral, Lucilla went to him, and was surprised at recognizing the valet {{of one of the}} gentlemen who had stayed at Castle Blanch.

60|$|Our Voyage {{having come}} to an end, I will take a short retrospect of the {{advantages}} and disadvantages, the pains and pleasures, of our circumnavigation of the world. If <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>asked</b> my advice, before undertaking a long voyage, my answer would depend upon his possessing a decided taste for some branch of knowledge, which could by this means be advanced. No doubt it is a high satisfaction to behold various countries and the many races of mankind, but the pleasures gained at the time do not counterbalance the evils. It is necessary {{to look forward to}} a harvest, however distant that may be, when some fruit will be reaped, some good effected.|$|E
50|$|The classic Filipino {{inspirational}} song, “Natutulog Ba Ang Diyos?” (lit. Is God Sleeping?) {{was used}} as the series’ theme song. It was written and composed by Nonong Buencamino.

5000|$|Type I: Dua al-masalah, or the dua of asking. This type of dua is {{when one}} asks for the {{fulfillment}} of a need, or that some harm be removed from him/her.

5000|$|Another word {{frequently}} {{used in the}} Interactional View is double-bind.

50|$|Because animal {{husbandry}} {{was central to}} the Kazakhs' traditional lifestyle, most of their nomadic practices and customs relate {{in some way to}} livestock. Traditional curses and blessings invoked disease or fecundity among animals, and good manners required that <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>ask</b> first about the health of a man's livestock when greeting him and only afterward inquire about the human aspects of his life.|$|R
50|$|Mithridates, who {{was king}} of twenty-two nations, {{administered}} their laws {{in as many}} languages, and could harangue each of them, without employing an interpreter. There was in Greece a man named Charmidas, who, when <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>asked</b> him for any book in a library, could repeat it by heart, just {{as though he were}} reading. Memory, in fine, has been made an art; which was first invented by the lyric poet, Simonides, and perfected by Metrodorus of Scepsis, so as to enable persons to repeat word for word exactly what they have heard.|$|E
5000|$|Prabhashankar was {{a natural}} donor. He used to donate most of his money to the needy.

50|$|People usually intend {{socially}} desirable outcomes, hence {{socially desirable}} outcomes are not informative about a person's intention or disposition. The most that someone can infer {{is that the}} person is normal - which is not saying anything very much. But socially undesirable actions are more informative about intentions and dispositions. Suppose <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>asked</b> a friend for a loan of £1 and it was given (a socially desirable action) - the perceiver couldn't say a great deal about their friend's kindness or helpfulness because most people {{would have done the same}} thing. If, on the other hand, the friend refused to lend them the money (a socially undesirable action), the perceiver might well feel that their friend is rather stingy, or even miserly.|$|E

50|$|Safety Not Guaranteed is a 2012 American science-fiction {{romantic comedy}} film {{directed}} by Colin Trevorrow. The film {{was inspired by}} a 1997 Backwoods Home Magazine classified ad, itself written as a joke filler by Backwoods employee John Silveira, by <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>asking</b> for someone to accompany him in a time-travelling excursion. It was screened at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award.|$|R
5000|$|A running gag of {{the series}} was the bar tender who {{miraculously}} and instantly produced anything <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>asked</b> for, {{even if it was}} something rare, obscure or unlikely to be expected at a Japanese bar. The bar tender would never say a word except [...] "Aru yo." [...] (meaning [...] "I got it"). He would even produce the obscure items that Kuryu couldn't get from the infomercial channel. The character even appears as a sushi chef in the rural village of the 2006 special. Kuryu asks the chef if he is the same person, twin brother or close relative of the Tokyo bar tender, but the chef characteristically says nothing, only [...] "Aru yo" [...] when asked for items.|$|E
5000|$|... "At {{the core}} of NLP is the belief that, when people are engaged in activities, they are also making use of a {{representational}} system; that is, they are using some internal representation of the materials they are involved with, such as a conversation, a rifle shot, a spelling task. These representations can be visual, auditory, kinesthetic, or involve the other senses. In addition, a person may be creating a representation or recalling one. For example, <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>asked</b> to spell a word may visualize that word printed {{on a piece of}} paper, may hear it being sounded out, or may construct the spelling from the application of a series of logical rules." [...] Daniel Druckman (Ed.) (1988), Enhancing Human Performance: Issues, Theories, and Techniques(pp.138-139) ...|$|E
5000|$|NLP also {{suggests}} that sometimes (again not universally) such processing is associated with sensory word use; for example, <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>asked</b> what they liked about the beach, may flick their eyes briefly in some characteristic direction (visual memory access, often upwards) and then also use words that describe it in a visual sense ("The sea looked lovely", and so on). Likewise asked about a problem, someone may look {{in a different direction}} for a while (kinesthetic access, typically downwards) and then look puzzled and say [...] "I just can't seem {{to get a grip on}} things". Taken together, NLP suggests such eye accessing cues (1) are idiosyncratic and habitual for each person, and (2) may form significant clues as to how a person is processing or representing a problem to themselves unconsciously.|$|E

[...] Pyotr Mamonov, who plays the lead character, formerly one of the few rock musicians in the USSR, converted to Eastern Orthodoxy in the 1990s and lives now in an isolated village.

However the newly formed animals were violent and {{dangerous}} so he sent a great flood. After a long time, Markohuvek, <b>a</b> <b>person,</b> <b>asked</b> Komashtam'hó why he was making a great flood. Komashtam'hó replied to Markohuvek that he was trying to protect the people from the newly formed animals. Markohuvek replied that gradually people would freeze to death since there wasn't any fire. So Komastam'hó made a great fire to evaporate the water. However he made it accidentally too hot and he was slightly burned. Komashtam'hó then took a giant pole and smashed the house of his father. Water welling from the house became the Colorado River. And in it swam fish, eels, and other water animals. These were the beings created by Bakotahl.

40|$|Gift-giving {{has often}} puzzled economists, {{especially}} because efficient gifts-like cash or giving exactly what <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>asks</b> for-seem crass or inappropriate. It {{is shown in}} a formal game-theoretic model that gifts serve as "signals" of a person's intentions about future investment in a relationship, and inefficient gifts can be better signals. Other explanations for the inefficiency of gift giving are advanced, and some stylized facts about gift-giving practices are described (many of which {{are consistent with the}} signaling view of gifts) ...|$|R
