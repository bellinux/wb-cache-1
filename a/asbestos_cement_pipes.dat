50|$|For the pH of {{drinking}} water, the threshold value is 6.5 - 9.5. pH values outside the neutral range (pH 6.5 - 7.5) are principally critical, since they provide {{an indication of}} the corrosion behaviour of water. Slightly acidic water (pH 4 - 6.5) usually corrodes galvanized iron pipes, but also copper and <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> <b>pipes.</b> This process is known as acid corrosion. Practical experience has shown that the use of unprotected steel pipes is only possible at neutral pH values. By lower pH values, the removal of the pure zinc layer is promoted. As a result of the dissolved salts and gases, natural cold waters usually show a slightly alkaline reaction. These properties are created by setting the equilibrium concentrations of dissolved carbon dioxide in the form of bicarbonate ions and carbonate ions. Higher alkaline pH values (pH 9 - 14) in the presence of oxygen as an oxidant lead to so-called oxygen corrosion. To avoid the described acid or oxygen corrosion, buffer solutions are added to the raw water for drinking water production. By the pH-stabilizing effect of hypolimnetic aeration, the application of these buffer solutions can be reduced, thus reducing operating costs.|$|E

40|$|Asbestos cement {{pipelines}} {{constitute a}} significant portion of the potable and waste water systems in many countries in the world, including Australia. Most of the <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> <b>pipes</b> in the developed countries were installed before 1980, and many utilities are observing that the breakage rate is increasing with the ageing of the pipe. Condition assessment for <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> <b>pipes</b> is of important necessity for prioritising rehabilitation and preventing catastrophic pipe failure; however, few techniques are available for direct assessment of the condition of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> <b>pipes</b> and most of them are localised and destructive. This article outlines a pilot field study of the non-invasive and non-destructive condition assessment of asbestos cement pipelines using fluid transient pressure waves. Fluid transient analysis previously conducted by the authors for metallic pipelines is further developed and adapted to <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> <b>pipes</b> for the detection of localised defects. A new sub-sectional condition assessment technique is proposed for determining the effective wall thicknesses of asbestos cement sub-sections within a section of pipe bounded by two measurement points. A field trial is conducted in Australia on an asbestos cement water main (which has class changes with varying wall thicknesses) to verify the proposed techniques. The wave speeds, lengths and wall thicknesses of sub-sections in different classes are determined and the results are consistent with the information in the design drawings provided by the water utility.

40|$|Abstract: In Japan, {{crocidolite}} {{had been}} used for <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> <b>pipe</b> and spraying, and amosite {{had been used}} for building board and spraying. These two types of asbestos had stopped to use in Japan in the late 1970 s. An extreme increase in imported asbestos (all 3 commercial types) was observed between 1960 and 1974. In 1960, 77, 000 tons of asbestos were imported, and reached the peak as 352, 316 tons in 1974. This extreme rise of asbestos imports corresponds with the recent rapid increase in mortality of malignant pleural mesothelioma. Between 1995 and 1999, an estimated mean annual death from pleural mesothelioma was about 500. The annual number of compensated occupational respiratory cancers due to asbestos exposure has also been increasing. Up {{to the end of}} March 2000, 162 cases with malignant mesothelioma and 197 cases with lung cancer were compensated. As for lung cancer, epidemiological studies are scanty in Japan. Limited environmental data of the working places in asbestos textile factories suggests that heavy asbestos exposure in the past made deaths from respiratory diseases. Less asbestos exposure will enable exposed workers to survive enough to reach cancer age. Even now smoking rate among males in Japan are over 50 %.

Large robustness implies great immunity to uncertainty, while low robustness implies high vulnerability to uncertainty. A plan whose robustness is large is preferred over a plan with low robustness.

40|$|Reliable {{assessments}} of the relative contributions of diet (food, beverages, and orally administered drugs) and air (inhaled fibers) to total ingested asbestos exposure are not feasible due to the paucity of quantitative data on the subject. Instead, scenarios for both modes of exposure were developed from the limited information available to give crude estimates of ingestion of asbestos from these routes. They suggest that such sources are potentially significant relative to the contribution of asbestos exposure derived from drinking water. Research recommendations are discussed. The general public has {{become aware of the}} potential gastrointestinal exposure to asbestos fibers from drinking water flowing through <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> <b>pipe</b> or from fibers derived from natural sources of asbestos in rivers or reservoirs. However, most people are unaware that diet and air may also contribute significantly to the ingested asbestos exposure.

Information gaps in this area exist that preclude an accurate measure of the total ingested load of asbestos. The types of studies needed to fill these gaps are identified.

In South Africa only a few peritoneal mesotheliomas come from the asbestos areas, and the incidence of gastrointestinal carcinomas is no greater than normal. Intrapleural and intraperitoneal injection produces unrealistic situations. Calcium salts are deposited on <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> <b>pipes</b> from hard water and organic material from soft water.

40|$|Drinking water {{infrastructure}} functions {{to provide a}} service to meet customer demands and health requirements. Pipe repairs {{are one of the}} biggest challenges of ageing {{water infrastructure}} in the UK and world wide. Pressure transients resulting from sudden interruptions of the movement of the water can be caused by routine value operations. In a single pipeline one extreme event can burst a pipe. However the occurrences and impact of pressure transients in operational water distribution systems were not currently fully understood. This research developed new insights and understanding of pressure transient occurrences and their contribution to observed pipe repair rates. A large scale field monitoring program, including deploying and managing high-speed (100 Hz) instrumentation for 11 months, was designed and implemented to cover 67 district metered areas (DMA) subdivided into 79 pressure zones. In total 144 locations were monitored. The data was analysed using a novel method, termed transient fingerprint. This allowed the identification of discrete pressure transients and their three fundamental components (magnitude, duration and numbers of occurrences) leading to a quantitative interpretation of pressure transients. Evolutionary polynomial regression modelling was used to assess the impact of directly measured pressure transient data in context with static pressure, age, diameter and soil variables on 64 cast iron pipes. The analysis suggested that high magnitude, short duration repeatedly occurring pressure transients can have an adverse effect on the pipes. The extrapolation of pressure transient analysis into 7978 cast iron pipes showed inconclusive results suggesting that more accurate pressure transient data is required for each pipe in the network. Additional analysis carried out on 25 <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> <b>pipes,</b> with actual measurements of pressure transients for each pipe, confirmed an adverse effect of pressure transient on water network observed in cast iron pipes. This research has provided an understanding of the occurrence of pressure transients that has implications on pipe management strategies. Mitigation techniques to locate pressure transient sources based on the project outcomes could be utilised to better manage distribution systems and ultimately reduce future pipe replacements and associated costs. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to update earlier studies of Keetmanshoop’s water distribution and to evaluate the performance of Keetmanshoop’s water distribution network and water sector. This includes data such as the level of non-revenue water, pressures in the pipelines and network’s appurtenances. The aim is also to model Keetmanshoop’s water distribution network, and to simulate its performance for different outputs, such as maximum and minimum pressure and net flow. The model would then be used and updated by Keetmanshoop Municipality. Finally, the last objective is to present improvements to Keetmanshoop’s water distribution. The materials and methods used in this study were a literature survey, primarily of the previous studies, semi-structured interviews, observations and conversations, field measurements and Keetmanshoop Municipality’s accounting. The research was mainly conducted in Keetmanshoop in June and July 2015. Moreover, the water distribution network model was constructed with WaterCAD, QGIS and FCGnet software. The minimum pressure of 200 kPa in the whole network isn’t achieved, thus the southern part of the network suffers from excessive pressure. The frequency of pipe breakages is high and indicates the network to be in a poor condition. Pipe breakages mainly occur from the old age of the pipe network, high pressure and lack of air release valves. The level of non-revenue water is 18. 0 %, which is below the 20 %, the main target of this EU funded project. However, it should be higher due to the factors such as the overflowing of the municipality’s reservoirs and high frequency of pipe breakages. These factors also indicate that the municipality’s accounting of billed water is faulty. The water distribution network model doesn’t reliably replicate the actual network. There are many reasons for this, such as the complexity of water demand in the actual network and faulty map elements that the model was based on. The model is still approximate and indicates the performance of the actual network and some problematic areas, e. g. the southern part of the town where the pressure is excessive. Keetmanshoop’s water distribution can be improved in many ways. For instance, the 350 inactive water meters should be replaced and new gate valves, pressure reducing valves and air release valves are needed. The old <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> <b>pipes</b> should be replaced with new plastic (uPVC) pipes as soon as possible.

40|$|Techniques are {{available}} to minimize the concentration of asbestos fibers in drinking water. Filtration research conducted at locations on Lake Superior and in the Cascade Mountains in Washington has shown that amphibole and chrysotile fibers can be removed by granular media filtration. Removal percentages can exceed 99 % when the raw water is coagulated properly and the filtered water turbidity is 0. 10 ntu (nephelometric turbidity units) or lower. Filtered water fiber counts below detectable limits of 0. 1 to 0. 01 X 10 (6) fibers/L can be attained. A study by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California showed that when raw water chrysotile counts ranged from 200 X 10 (6) fibers/L to 2000 X 10 (6) fibers/L, filtered water fiber counts frequently exceeded 1 X 10 (6) fibers/L.

Microfungal filaments and sporulating structures were recovered from most of the pipe inner surface biofilm and dead end sediment samples, but were sparser in the biofilm than in the sediment samples. No recognisable, vegetative filamentous fungi were found in the slowly developing biofilm on coupons. This study indicates that airborne spores are an important potential source of microfungi found in water storage reservoirs. It has also demonstrated conclusively that filamentous microfungi grow and sporulate on water pipe inner surfaces and in soft sediments within the water distribution system...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} mortality from {{lung cancer}} {{and the risk}} attributable to asbestos separately for <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> workers and for the general (non-occupationally exposed) population {{in the town of}} Casale Monferrato, where the largest Italian <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> factory had been in operation in 1907 - 86. According to cancer registry data, in the same town the incidence of malignant mesothelioma in the general population is about 10 times higher than in comparable Italian provinces. METHOD: Decedents from lung cancer in 1989 - 95 were nominally identified in the list of decedents kept at the Local Health Authority of Casale Monferrato. Workers in the <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> factory have been identified with a search in the nominal list of workers and the same was done for the wives of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> workers. These lists have already been used in cohort studies. Sensitivity and specificity of the linkage procedure with occupational activity in <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> production have been evaluated in a previous study. Population at risk was estimated on the basis of official figures and on the results of the cohort study of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> workers. RESULTS: 227 deaths from lung cancer were included (184 men and 43 women). Among the <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> workers mortalities were 234. 0 x 100, 000 person-years among men and 35. 5 among women. Corresponding figures in the general (non- occupationally exposed) population in Casale Monferrato were 80. 6 and 18. 7. The rates in the general population were not higher than {{in the rest of the}} region. Attributable risk (AR) among the <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> workers (and wives) is 67. 5 % (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 56. 8 to 78. 2) for men and 51. 3 % (95 % CI 14. 9 to 87. 8) among women. Population AR to occupational or paraoccupational exposure in the <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> production is 18. 3 % (95 % CI 11. 1 to 25. 6) among men and 10. 1 % (95 % CI 0 to 24. 6) among women. CONCLUSION: This work did not show an increase in mortality from lung cancer for the population not exposed occupationally, but a large excess was found among men and women occupationally exposed in <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> production. The total burden of lung cancer due to occupational exposure to asbestos may be underestimated, as only occupational exposure in <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> production was taken into consideration. Nevertheless even a single factory can be responsible for a considerable proportion of deaths from lung cancer in a population...|$|R

40|$|The {{predominant}} {{asbestos fibre}} type {{used in the}} production of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> is chrysotile. The use of asbestos in relation to fibre type in a Norwegian <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> plant during 1942 - 80 was 91. 7 % chrysotile, 3. 1 % amosite, 4. 1 % crocidolite, and 1. 1 % anthophyllite respectively. Electron microscopy and x ray microanalysis of lung tissue samples of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> workers who had died of malignant pleural mesothelioma or bronchogenic carcinoma showed a completely inverse ratio with regard to fibre type. The percentage of chrysotile asbestos in lung tissue varied between 0 % and 9 % whereas the corresponding numbers for the amphiboles were 76 % and 99 %. These differences are discussed with respect to the behaviour of different fibre types in the human body and to the occurrence of malignant mesothelioma in this <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> factory...|$|R
