40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a simulation {{tool for the}} compaction process of hot mix asphalt (HMA) using a roller under varying external conditions. The {{focus is on the}} use of the finite element model (FEM) with code DiekA, on its necessary requirements and on the presentation of simulation results. The approach requires the availability of a suitable material model, equipment to measure material parameters and a laboratory-testing program for fitting the correct material parameters. Subsequently, in discussing the simulation results attention is paid to; the principal stresses, strains and shear stresses inside the material during rolling, and the incremental displacements of the material. Furthermore, the simulated density path as a function of depth inside the layer is presented for a series of <b>applied</b> <b>roller</b> passes. In conclusion it can be stated that FEM approaches in general are well suited to simulate compaction processes of HMA on condition that the selected FEM comprises the right features...|$|R

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{high rate of}} {{construction}} and economical advantages, roller compacted concrete pavements (RCCP), are finding increased use in many countries. RCCP has successfully been used for pavement construction in ports, cargo terminals, low speed roads, parking lots and heavy and military vehicle roads. Research and development is continuing to improve skid resistance {{of this type of}} pavements which should lead to its wide spread use in high speed roads. Due to their large surface area, concrete pavements are sensitive to the curing method and duration which is applied for them <b>applied.</b> <b>Roller</b> compacted concrete pavements (RCCP) are expected to be particularly sensitive in this regard due to their low mix water content. It is thus important to characterize the effect of various curing regimes on strength and durability of RCCP concretes, so that appropriate minimum curing requirements can be set in project specifications. In this research, effects of three different curing regimes, namely; water curing, application of curing compounds and air curing, on strength and permeability of RCCP mixes were investigated. The experimental work was conducted on two different RCCP mixes with 275 and 350 kg/m 3, of cementations materials. The results of experimental program showed the substantial effect of curing regime on strength and durability of RCCP mixes.

30|$|An {{increased}} {{range of}} movement was achieved in the treated QM (MPTT, MPrTT). Bradbury-Squires et al. [4] also found increases, ranging from 10 to 16 %, for knee-joint ROM with <b>applying</b> a <b>roller</b> massager for 20 and 60  s on the QM. Although the ischiocrural muscles (MFFD) were not treated by the participants, a significant change pre- to post-treatment in ROM was found. A coherence between the ITB and the ischicrurale muscles was also observed by Kwak et al. [33]. Hence, loading the ITB alters the kinematics and contact pattern of the tibiofemoral joint similarly to loading the hamstrings.|$|R

30|$|DRCS {{is a type}} of {{conventional}} spinning process; therefore, it has many of the same advantages as conventional spinning. For example, <b>rollers</b> <b>apply</b> pressure to the local section of a workpiece, which produces local plastic deformation. Therefore, less force is needed than that in conventional pressure processing. Thus, the forming load capacity and equipment cost of DRCS is significantly reduced. In addition, DRCS can produce the products with high mechanical strength and good surface quality. It is worth mentioning that DRCS has some advantages that conventional spinning lacks.|$|R
50|$|Aluminium foil is {{produced}} by rolling sheet ingots cast from molten billet aluminium, then re-rolling on sheet and foil rolling mills to the desired thickness, or by continuously casting and cold rolling. To maintain a constant thickness in aluminium foil production, beta radiation is passed through the foil to a sensor on the other side. If the intensity becomes too high, then the rollers adjust, increasing the thickness. If the intensities become too low and the foil has become too thick, the <b>rollers</b> <b>apply</b> more pressure, causing the foil to be made thinner.|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{applications}} of elastohydrodynamic film thickness expressions were considered. The motion of a steel ball over steel surfaces presenting varying degrees of conformity was examined. The equation for minimum film thickness in elliptical conjunctions under elastohydrodynamic conditions was <b>applied</b> to <b>roller</b> and ball bearings. An involute gear was also introduced, it was again found that the elliptical conjunction expression yielded a conservative estimate of the minimum film thickness. Continuously variable-speed drives like the Perbury gear, which present truly elliptical elastohydrodynamic conjunctions, are favored increasingly in mobile and static machinery. A representative elastohydrodynamic condition for this class of machinery is considered for power transmission equipment. The possibility of elastohydrodynamic films of water or oil forming between locomotive wheels and rails is examined.

The more complex of these required some fifty handlings {{in and out of the}} press and could take a whole day to complete. Another of his experimental techniques was the painstaking production of abstract designs using the typewriter, which he called tiksels. After 1929 he also began writing rhythmic sound poems.|$|R
5000|$|... {{ability to}} adjust the amount of ink on the {{fountain}} roller with screw keys. Most commonly, a metal blade controls the amount of ink transferred from the ink trough to the fountain roller. By adjusting the screws, the operator alters {{the gap between the}} blade and the fountain roller, increasing or decreasing the amount of ink <b>applied</b> to the <b>roller</b> in certain areas. This consequently modifies the density of the colour in the respective area of the image. On older machines one adjusts the screws manually, but on modern machines the screw keys are operated electronically by the printer controlling the machine, enabling a much more precise result.|$|R
2500|$|Lithography {{originally}} used {{an image}} drawn with oil, fat, or wax {{onto the surface}} of a smooth, level lithographic limestone plate. The stone was treated with a mixture of acid and gum arabic, [...] "etching" [...] the grease content of the drawing material into the pores of the stone and chemically creating grease reservoirs. The open stone (without drawing) was affected by the gum arabic creating a thin gum layer that would then attract water. When the stone was subsequently moistened, these gummed areas retained water; an oil-based ink could then be <b>applied</b> with a <b>roller</b> sticking only to the original drawing. The ink would finally be transferred to a cotton fine art paper sheet, producing a printed page. This traditional technique is still used as a fine art medium today.|$|R
50|$|In 16th-century Europe, oil {{painting}} on canvas arose as an easier method for mural painting.

The canvas itself is more subject to rapid deterioration than a plaster ground.Different muralists tend to become experts in their preferred medium and application, whether that be oil paints, emulsion or acrylic paints <b>applied</b> by brush, <b>roller</b> or airbrush/aerosols.

50|$|Ink of {{a second}} color, and the {{thinnest}} viscosity, is then applied {{to the surface of}} the plate with a hard rubber roller, so that it covers the plate in one pass and only transfers onto the highest areas of the plate. Ink of a third color, and a much stiffer consistency, is then applied to the lower areas of the plate with a softer rubber roller. The varying viscosities of the two rolled-on inks prevent them from mixing. A fourth color, of even thinner viscosity, can also be applied at this point. This color is either spread out on a glass plate, which is then pressed against the printing plate so that the ink only adheres to the highest points of the metal plate, or it is applied by a hard <b>roller</b> <b>applied</b> with very little pressure.|$|R

The bearing plates and rollers were heat-treated to maximum possible hardness, to minimize local deformations. Lead sheets were used between the load bearing plates and girder surface to aid in uniform loading. The MTS “MultiFlex” System precisely controlled the applied loads and displacements through the actuators. Each girder was first loaded using Actuators B and C under a load-control mode {{at a rate of}} 9  KN/min. As soon as the slope of load versus displacement curve for girder being tested dropped, the actuator control-mode was switched to a displacement-control at a rate of 5  mm/h until shear failure occurred {{at either end of the}} girder. The displacement-control mode was essential in capturing the ductility or brittleness behavior of the girder failing in shear.|$|R

50|$|Lithography is a {{technique}} invented in 1798 by Alois Senefelder {{and based on the}} chemical repulsion of oil and water.A porous surface, normally limestone, is used; the image is drawn on the limestone with a greasy medium.Acid is applied, transferring the grease to the limestone, leaving the image 'burned' into the surface. Gum arabic, a water-soluble substance, is then applied, sealing the surface of the stone not covered with the drawing medium.The stone is wetted, with water staying only on the surface not covered in grease-based residue of the drawing; the stone is then 'rolled up', meaning oil ink is <b>applied</b> with a <b>roller</b> covering the entire surface; since water repels the oil in the ink, the ink adheres only to the greasy parts, perfectly inking the image.A sheet of dry paper is placed on the surface, and the image is transferred to the paper by the pressure of the printing press.

A thinned mixture of resin is used to penetrate the fibres of light weight woods such as Balsa and Western red cedar forming a waterproof barrier, far superior to single pot paint or varnish. In small boat and kayak construction Epoxy resin is often used in conjunction with lightweight 3 or 4 mm thick Okoume (Gaboon) plywood to form very light strong hulls. Typically few nails or screws are needed as the resin is so strong. Slow drying and far stronger but more difficult to sand than polyester resin.
