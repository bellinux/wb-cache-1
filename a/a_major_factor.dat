In bad infestations insect pressure is responsible for over 90% loss in yield. The legume pod borer, Maruca vitrata, is the main pre-harvest pest of the cowpea. Other important pests include pod sucking bugs, thrips and the post-harvest cowpea weevil, Callosobruchus maculatus.|$|E

He was accused of posting bureaucrats and police officers who would stay silent during the demolition. Anju Gupta, an Indian Police Service officer in charge of Advani's security, appeared as a prominent witness before the commission. She said that Advani and Joshi made provocative speeches that were <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> in the mob's behaviour.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 2000s, {{orangutan}} habitat has decreased rapidly due to logging and forest fires, {{as well as}} fragmentation by roads. <b>A</b> <b>major</b> <b>factor</b> in {{that period of time}} has been the conversion of vast areas of tropical forest to palm oil plantations in response to international demand. Palm oil is used for cooking, cosmetics, mechanics, and biodiesel. Hunting is also a major problem as is the illegal pet trade.|$|E
