5|$|Over the years, Madagascar has had {{different}} language policies under different influences of authority. The indigenous language of Madagascar, Malagasy, was the predominant language {{on the island}} until the French colonization in 1897. Malagasy has developed throughout the decades from an oral language to <b>a</b> <b>language</b> <b>that</b> has a written system (Latin orthography), a change that was enforced by King Radama I, in 1823.|$|E
5|$|Since 1993, Canadians have {{no longer}} been {{eligible}} for the Victoria Cross: that medal has been superseded by the Canadian Victoria Crossof equal honour, but yet to be awarded. The Canadian medal differs only in that the inscription is in Latin rather than English; by using <b>a</b> <b>language</b> <b>that</b> is an ancestor of both English and French, the medal avoids linguistic discrimination between Canada's two official languages.|$|E
5|$|When several {{languages}} {{are used in}} a film, the predominant one is always listed first; {{the names of the}} other {{languages are}} written in smaller typesize and placed between brackets. When a film's original title is in <b>a</b> <b>language</b> <b>that</b> uses a non-Latin script, it is first transliterated into the Latin alphabet and then written in its original script.|$|E
50|$|Tlapanec is <b>an</b> ergative-absolutive <b>language.</b> However, {{while most}} {{languages}} {{of this type}} have an overt ergative case, Tlapanec {{is one of the}} rare examples of <b>a</b> marked absolutive <b>language,</b> <b>that</b> is, <b>an</b> ergative <b>language</b> <b>that</b> overtly marks the absolutive and leaves the ergative unmarked.|$|R

5|$|Drivers are {{not legally}} {{required}} to take field sobriety tests, although the results are admissible in court. The Alcotest has replaced the Breathalyzer as the standard device for determining blood alcohol level. When a driver is arrested for DUI, the police are prohibited from using force to obtain a breath, blood, or urine sample, and must warn {{the driver of the}} consequences of refusing a breath sample. In 2010, the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned the breath sample refusal conviction of a non-English speaking driver, ruling that drivers must be notified of the law in <b>a</b> <b>language</b> <b>that</b> they understand. A person can be charged with DUI or breath refusal up to 90 days after the incident, except in cases of serious injury or death, in which case the statute of limitations is 5 years.|$|E
5|$|It also liberally uses loanwords {{from the}} Tulu and Kannada languages. It {{is written in}} the Kannada script. The dialect does not {{distinguish}} between the nouns of Kannada and Konkani and has developed into <b>a</b> <b>language</b> <b>that</b> is very practical for business. Some Kannada rootwords which have disappeared from the Goan dialects due {{to the influence of}} Portuguese have re-entered the Mangalorean lexicon. 350–400 Portuguese lexical items are found in the Mangalorean Catholic dialect, of which more than half are related to religious terminology. The influence of Portuguese syntax is only found in some sets of phrases and prayers which have come down from the pre-migration era.|$|E
5|$|Pinkerton, who in 1816 was the BFBS's {{representative}} in Moscow, had met that {{year with a}} community of Albanians in Vienna, then capital of the Austrian Empire. They assured him that a translation of the New Testament into Albanian was indeed possible. In {{a letter to his}} superiors at the BFBS, dated August 28, 1816, Pinkerton wrote that the Albanian nation occupied {{a large part of the}} ancient Illyria, that they spoke a language completely different from Slavic, Turkish, Greek, or Latin, and that for the Albanian Orthodox the mass was recited in Greek, <b>a</b> <b>language</b> <b>that</b> believers and even some of the priests did not understand. According to Pinkerton, the translation could be done by one or more Albanians from the Ionian islands under the supervision of an Albanian bishop.|$|E

5|$|Representatives enthusiastically {{described}} <b>a</b> <b>language</b> <b>that</b> {{could work}} {{in a wide variety}} of environments, from banking and insurance to utilities and inventory control. They agreed unanimously that more people should be able to program and that the new language should not be restricted by the limitations of contemporary technology. A majority agreed that the language should make maximal use of English, be capable of change, be machine-independent and be easy to use, even at the expense of power.|$|E
5|$|In the 14th century, {{most of the}} town's {{inhabitants}} and {{the local}} elite were Saxons, largely descended from settlers brought in by the Kings of Hungary in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries to develop and defend the southern borders of the province. By {{the middle of the}} next century roughly half the population had Hungarian names. In Transylvania as a whole, the Reformation sharpened ethnic divisions: Saxons became Lutheran while Hungarians either remained Catholic or became Calvinist or Unitarian. In Kolozsvár, however, the religious lines were blurred. Isolated both geographically from the main areas of German settlement in southern Transylvania and institutionally because of their distinctive religious trajectory, many Saxons eventually assimilated to the Hungarian majority over several generations. New settlers to the town largely spoke Hungarian, <b>a</b> <b>language</b> <b>that</b> many Saxons gradually adopted. (In the seventeenth century, out of more than thirty royal free towns, only seven had a Hungarian majority, with Kolozsvár/Klausenburg being one of them; the rest were largely German-dominated.) In this manner Kolozsvár became largely Hungarian speaking and would remain so through the mid-20th century, though 4.8% of its residents identified as German as late as 1880.|$|E

25|$|Another {{example of}} this {{semantic}} dependency {{is the difference between}} possible interpretations in <b>a</b> <b>language</b> <b>that</b> marks inalienable possession (e.g. French) with <b>a</b> <b>language</b> <b>that</b> does not (e.g. English). Inalienable possession is semantically dependent and is defined in reference to another object to which it belongs. (20) is ambiguous and has two possible meanings. In the inalienable possessive interpretation, la main belongs to the subject, les enfants. The second interpretation is that la main is an alienable object that does not belong to the subject. The English equivalent of this sentence (The children raised the hand) only has the alienable possessive reading in which the hand does not belong to the children.|$|E
