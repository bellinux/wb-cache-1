It enables {{the development of a}} wide range of high performance analog ICs capable of 33 V operation in a footprint that no previous generation of high voltage parts could achieve. Unlike analog ICs using conventional CMOS processes, iCMOS components can accept bipolar input signals while providing increased performance, dramatically reduced power consumption, and reduced package size. The AD 7321 can accept true bipolar <b>analog</b> <b>input</b> signals. The AD 7321 has four software-selectable input ranges, ± 10 V, ± 5 V, ± 2. 5 V, and 0 V to + 10 V. Each <b>analog</b> <b>input</b> channel is independently programmed to one of the four <b>input</b> ranges. The <b>analog</b> <b>input</b> channels on the AD 7321 are programmed to be single-ended, true differential, or pseudo differential. The ADC contains a 2. 5 V internal reference. The AD 7321 also allows for external reference operation. If a 3 V reference is applied to the REFIN/OUT pin, the AD 7321 can accept a true bipolar ± 12 V <b>analog</b> <b>input.</b> A minimum of ± 12 V VDD and VSS supplies are required for the ± 12 V input range. The ADC has a high speed serial interface that can operate at throughput rates up to 500 kSPS...|$|R
