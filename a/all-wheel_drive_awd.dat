From 1984, Holden began branding the flagship Commodore model as Holden Calais, with the Commodore Berlina introduced in 1984 gaining independent Holden Berlina nomenclature in 1988. Long-wheelbase Statesman/Caprice derivatives and Commodore utility body variants followed in 1990. The third generation architecture spawned the most body styles, with a new Holden utility launched in 2000 (now officially as the Holden Ute), reborn Monaro coupé in 2001, four-door Holden Crewman utility and <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> (<b>AWD)</b> Holden Adventra crossover in 2003. Holden Special Vehicles (HSV) in 1987 began official modification of high performance variants of the Commodore and its derivatives, under its own nameplate.|$|E

25|$|Drift {{cars are}} usually light-to-moderate weight rear-wheel-drive coupes and sedans, {{offering}} a large {{range of power}} levels. There have also been <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> cars (<b>AWD)</b> that have been converted to rear-wheel drive such as Subaru WRX, Toyota Avensis as Scion tC, Mitsubishi EVO and Nissan GT-R. Early on AWD cars without conversion were allowed in some drifting competitions, usually the rules allowed only {{a certain percentage of}} power to be sent to the front wheels, but are banned in most (if not all) drifting competitions today.|$|R
2500|$|Initial {{layout and}} design {{elements}} for the 86 were presented by Toyota using its [...] "FT" [...] (Future Toyota) concept car nomenclature. The {{first was the}} Toyota FT-HS, which {{was presented at the}} Detroit Motor Show in 2007. [...] It had a front engine, rear-wheel drive layout and 2+2 seating and was powered by a V6 engine with hybrid electric assistance. [...] In 2008, Toyota bought 16.5% of Fuji Heavy Industries, which includes the Subaru automotive brand. [...] Toyota, led by project leader Tetsuya Tada, then offered Subaru to become involved in its new sport coupé project, by co-developing the new D-4S boxer engine, however, this was rejected since the design conflicted with Subaru's reputation for high performance <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> (<b>AWD)</b> cars. [...] This outcome resulted in the project coming to a six-month halt before Toyota invited journalists and Subaru engineers to test a developmental prototype. [...] Following this test, Subaru agreed to become further involved in development.|$|E

50|$|In all its post Volkswagen-era models, Audi has firmly {{refused to}} adopt the {{traditional}} rear-wheel drive layout favored by its two archrivals Mercedes-Benz and BMW, favoring either front-wheel <b>drive</b> or <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive.</b> The majority of Audi's lineup in the United States features <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> standard on most of its expensive vehicles (only the entry-level trims of the A4 and A6 are available with front-wheel drive), in contrast to Mercedes-Benz and BMW whose lineup treats <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> as an option. BMW did not offer <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> on its V8-powered cars (as opposed to crossover SUVs) until the 2010 BMW 7 Series and 2011 BMW 5 Series, while the Audi A8 has had <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> available/standard since the 1990s. Regarding high-performance variants, Audi S and RS models have always had <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive,</b> unlike their direct rivals from BMW M and Mercedes-AMG whose cars are rear-wheel drive only (although their performance crossover SUVs are <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive).</b>|$|R

50|$|The Legacy was {{introduced}} in the USA as a competitor to the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, Nissan Stanza, and Mazda 626, with the Legacy offering All Wheel <b>Drive</b> (<b>AWD)</b> as a major distinguishing feature against its competition. (Toyota initially offered AWD on the Camry in the USA in limited markets, with the designation Camry LE All-Trac, but discontinued the feature due to disappointing sales.) The only Japanese competitor to continue offering all-wheel-drive in a similarly sized sedan was Mitsubishi in the premium sport package Mitsubishi Galant VR-4, whereas Subaru offered all-wheel-drive as an option on all trim levels internationally. The Legacy sedan had very similar dimensions and appearance to the current at the time Toyota Cressida. When Subaru decided to offer a sedan and wagon that pushed the limits of Japanese regulations concerning exterior dimensions and engine size, it appears they drew inspiration from early 1970s Toyota Mark II and Nissan Maxima, adding their <b>all-wheel</b> <b>drive</b> to the list of options as a safety feature.|$|R
