5|$|In Hindu mythology, Parvati, wife of Shiva, once {{closed the}} eyes of her husband playfully in a flower garden at their abode atop Mount Kailash. Although only <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>for</b> the gods, all light {{was taken from the}} universe, and the earth, in turn, was {{submerged}} in darkness for years. Parvati performed penance along with other devotees of Shiva. Then her husband appeared as a column of fire at the top of Annamalai hills, returning light to the world. He then merged with Parvati to form Ardhanarishvara, the half-female, half-male form of Shiva. The Annamalai, or red mountain, lies behind the Annamalaiyar temple, and is associated with the temple of its namesake. The hill is sacred and considered a lingam, or iconic representation of Shiva, in itself.|$|E
25|$|This is a {{historic}} moment– for the Congress, and for the women of this country. It is <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>for</b> which we have waited more than 200 years. Never losing faith, we waited through the many years of struggle to achieve our rights. But women weren't just waiting; women were working. Never losing faith, we worked to redeem the promise of America, that all {{men and women are}} created equal. For our daughters and granddaughters, today, we have broken the marble ceiling. For our daughters and our granddaughters, the sky is the limit, anything is possible for them.|$|E
500|$|A {{few days}} after their dinner, Braxton telephoned Ross to confirm that she had finally signed the contract; {{this was the first}} time Ross learned that Rice had {{apparently}} promised Braxton that he would write an entirely new song for her to sing in the musical if she agreed to sign the paperwork. Panicked, Ross immediately contacted Rice, who confirmed that he had in fact agreed to write a song for Braxton, blaming himself for having consumed too much alcohol during their dinner. Rice asked Ross to allow him 24 hours to review the musical and see if there was in fact <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>for</b> which he and Menken could develop a new song, and decided to write a ballad for the second act during which Belle tells Maurice how she has changed during her stay in the Beast's castle. [...] "A Change in Me" [...] was written four years into Beauty and the Beasts run.|$|E

500|$|Bradley's {{death and}} Smith's {{acquittal}} made national headlines; detailed stories {{ran in the}} New York Times, the New York Herald, the Philadelphia North American, and Forest and Stream. [...] The warden's wife and two young children were given a home in Key West, paid for by donations secured by the Florida Audubon Society. [...] The Society, however, {{made no effort to}} replace Bradley, and his job as warden went unfilled. [...] Bradley's obituary, written by William Dutcher and published in August 1905's edition of Bird Lore, characterized him as [...] "fearless and brave." [...] Dutcher eulogized Bradley by saying, [...] "A faithful and devoted warden, who was a young and sturdy man, cut off in <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>for</b> what? [...] That a few more plume birds might be secured to adorn heartless women's bonnets. [...] Heretofore the price has been the life of the birds, now is added human blood. [...] Every great movement must have its martyrs, and Guy M. Bradley is the first martyr in bird protection." ...|$|E
500|$|Lester's fantasies are {{emphasized}} by slow- and repetitive-motion shots; Mendes uses double-and-triple cutbacks in several sequences, and the score alters {{to make the}} audience aware that it is entering a fantasy. One example is the gymnasium scene—Lester's first encounter with Angela. While the cheerleaders perform their half-time routine to [...] "On Broadway", Lester becomes increasingly fixated on Angela. Time slows to represent his [...] "voyeuristic hypnosis" [...] and Lester begins to fantasize that Angela's performance is for him alone. [...] "On Broadway"—which provides a conventional underscore to the onscreen action—is replaced by discordant, percussive music that lacks melody or progression. This nondiegetic score is important to creating the narrative stasis in the sequence; it conveys <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>for</b> Lester that is stretched to an indeterminate length. The effect is one that Stan Link likens to [...] "vertical time", described by the composer and music theorist Jonathan Kramer as music that imparts [...] "a single present stretched out into an enormous duration, a potentially infinite 'now' that nonetheless feels like an instant". The music is used like a visual cue, so that Lester and the score are staring at Angela. The sequence ends with the sudden reintroduction of [...] "On Broadway" [...] and teleological time.|$|E
500|$|Mikael Wood of The Los Angeles Times, in {{reference}} to Hannah Montana, commented, [...] "Once again, make-believe Miley was more compelling than the real thing." [...] Wood believed Cyrus possessed charisma, commenting that she portrayed superstar authority, but failed because she was {{unable or unwilling to}} [...] "give her fans a deeper idea of who she is and what her music means. For all its eye-popping detail, the concert offered nothing that viewers of her TV show or buyers of her records don't already know about her." [...] Dave Paulson of The Tennessean stated, [...] "Cyrus' spectacle sets her apart from nearly every other A-list act touring today. She's not a renowned vocalist by any stretch, but her show's choreography barely provides <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>for</b> her to catch her breath, and she's still able to deliver." [...] Michael Hann of the United Kingdom-based Guardian was impressed by the concert, praising the setlist and deeming it enjoyable for both children and adults. He continued, [...] "Good as the best songs are, though, they take a backseat to the staging [...] The one misstep is when a trailer for her next movie is shown during a costume change. It's a tacky moment and doesn't reflect the attention to detail that makes the rest of it a laugh-out-loud delight." [...] Lael Loewenstein of Variety magazine said, [...] "Cyrus knows how to deliver the goods without losing her core audience." [...] Loewenstein deemed the concert a mission accomplished because of inevitable hits and Cyrus' charisma, drive, spunk, and a merely-limited vocal range. Erik Ensrst of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel praised the show, stating that it was [...] "a pure visual spectacle", but commented that producers forgot a place for Cyrus' personality.|$|E

2500|$|This {{created a}} {{challenge}} for ecclesiastical architects. [...] The Sunday-school building had to be designed {{in such a way}} that the pupils could quickly and efficiently be separated according to their various grades, and brought together for whole-school activities. John H. Vincent, an authority on Sunday schools in the Methodist Episcopal Church and later a bishop, described the architectural requirements: [...] "Provide for togetherness and separateness; have a room in which the whole school can be brought together in <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>for</b> simultaneous exercises, and with a minimum of movement can be divided into classes for uninterrupted classwork".|$|E
2500|$|Hayden {{announced}} his retirement on May 6, 1968, saying [...] "Among other things that fifty-six years in Congress have taught me is that contemporary events need contemporary men. Time actually makes specialists of us all. When a house is built there is <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>for</b> the foundation, another for the walls, the roof and so on. Arizona's foundation includes fast highways, adequate electric power, and abundant water, and these foundations have been laid. It is {{time for a new}} building crew to report, so I have decided to retire from office at the close of my term this year." [...] Hayden recommended long-term aide Roy Elson to succeed him. Elson lost his election bid to Senator Barry Goldwater.|$|E

Berman and Behr agreed with Paramount that the final episode of the series should concentrate on human drama rather than the endgame of the Dominion War.
