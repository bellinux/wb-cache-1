50|$|The {{historic}} Stone Bridge, {{which has}} <b>been</b> <b>lighted</b> in colorful, programmable LED <b>lights,</b> <b>is</b> located {{at one end}} of the park. Every evening the bridge <b>is</b> <b>lighted</b> for three hours, beginning with a 20-minute lightshow before settling into a static scheme chosen to reflect the time of year, holidays, or special events and observances. The bridge will <b>be</b> <b>lighted</b> during festival hours, starting at dusk.|$|R
5|$|Details of {{the fruit}} bodies' appearance, color in particular, are {{somewhat}} variable and dependent on growing conditions. For example, specimens growing on logs in oak and hickory forests in the spring {{tend to have more}} yellowish-white, depressed caps than those found in the same location in autumn, which <b>are</b> <b>light</b> yellow brown and more convex in shape. The fruit body development of M.rotula is hemiangiocarpous, with an hymenium that is only partially enclosed by basidiocarp tissues. Robert Kühner showed that a -like tissue covers the young gills before the expanding cap breaks away from the stem. In unfavorable weather conditions, however, the mushrooms may fail to develop normally and instead produce semi-gasteroid basidiocarps.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{during the}} fasting month of Ramadan, the Musaher {{of a town}} would yell and beat his drum to wake up the town's {{residents}} for suhoor (lit. 'of dawn')—usually {{very early in the}} morning, ranging from 4-6 am. The meals eaten during this time <b>are</b> <b>light</b> and foods include labaneh, cheese, bread and fried or boiled eggs along with various liquids to drink. The muezzin's call to dawn prayers signaled the beginning of sawm or fasting.|$|E
5|$|Prevailing winds in the {{interior}} <b>are</b> <b>light</b> to moderate northeast or southwest, and in the coastal area prevailing winds are determined by local area features. Higher wind velocities are more often recorded in cooler months along the coast, generally as bura or less frequently as sirocco. The sunniest {{parts of the country}} are the outer islands, Hvar and Korčula, where more than 2700hours of sunshine are recorded per year, followed by the middle and southern Adriatic Sea area in general and northern Adriatic coast, all with more than 2000hours of sunshine per year.|$|E

5|$|The Tunnel of Light is {{an artistic}} display {{of color and}} sound {{surrounding}} the escalator at the station. 1800 fluorescent lamps and 44 speakers are installed behind a layer of glass along the corridor, steadily changing color and mood. The theme is based on different experiences of travel in time and place. There <b>are</b> <b>light</b> and sound combinations for all seasons and all phases of life. The project was initiated by Kristin Jarmund. The light system was developed by Per Åge Lyså at Intravision System, and the software that mixes sound and color was developed by Yngve Sandboe. The music was composed by Bjarne Kvinnsland, mainly based on recorded samples. Among these are text written and performed by Beate Grimsrud.|$|E
5|$|The {{color of}} the spore print is pale yellow. Spores are ellipsoid, smooth, hyaline (translucent), and have {{dimensions}} of 8–10 by 5–6µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club shaped, two- to four-spored, and measure 24–30 by 8–10µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the inner walls of the tubes) <b>are</b> <b>light</b> yellow brown in color, club shaped, infrequent, and measure 25–38 by 7.2µm; the cheilocystidia (found on the tube edge) are colorless, numerous, and measure 32–47 by 7–10µm.

5|$|The {{epaulette}} shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) is {{a species of}} longtailed carpet shark, family Hemiscylliidae, found in shallow, tropical waters off Australia and New Guinea (and possibly elsewhere). The common name of this shark comes from the very large, white-margined black spot behind each pectoral fin, which are reminiscent of military epaulettes. A small species usually under 1m (3.3ft) long, the {{epaulette shark}} has a slender body with a short head and broad, paddle-shaped paired fins. The caudal peduncle (to which the tail fin is attached) comprises over half the shark's length. Adults <b>are</b> <b>light</b> brown above, with scattered darker spots and indistinct saddles.|$|E

5|$|The {{fruit of}} Aiphanes species {{is usually a}} red, spherical, single-seeded drupe. A thin skin (or epicarp), which can be either smooth or spiny, covers the fleshy mesocarp, which is {{typically}} orange and sweet. The mesocarp of A.horrida {{has one of the}} highest reported carotene contents of any plant product and is also rich in protein. The endocarp, which encases the seed, is brown or black and very hard at maturity. Seeds <b>are</b> <b>light</b> brown with a thin seed coat (or testa) and white endosperm, which is sweet and tastes somewhat like coconut.|$|E
5|$|The gray {{mouse lemur}} shares many traits with other mouse lemurs, {{including}} soft fur, a long tail, long hind limbs, a dorsal stripe {{down the back}} (not always distinct), a short snout, rounded skull, prominent eyes, and large, membranous, protruding ears. It has large eyes and a tapetum lucidum to enhance its vision at night. The dorsal coat is brownish-gray with various reddish tones, the flanks <b>are</b> <b>light</b> gray to beige, and the ventral fur has discrete dull beige or whitish-beige patches along portions of the belly. On the rounded face, there is a pale white patch above the nose and between the eyes; some individuals have dark orbital markings. The furred portions of the hands and feet are off-white.|$|E
5|$|The main {{airport for}} Roskilde is Copenhagen Airport {{which can be}} reached in about 40 minutes by train. Since April 1973, {{there has also been}} the small local Roskilde Airport, serving light {{aircraft}} for training, taxi, and flight instruction. There are plans to expand it for use by larger aircraft, possibly including discount international flights. The plans were approved, but lack of commitment from any carriers has postponed progress. The airport currently handles up to 100,000 operations (flights) per year, most of which <b>are</b> <b>light</b> aircraft operations associated with school flights.|$|E

5|$|The {{seeds of}} conifers, {{the largest group}} of gymnosperms, are {{enclosed}} in a cone and most species have seeds that <b>are</b> <b>light</b> and papery that can be blown considerable distances once free from the cone. Sometimes the seed remains in the cone for years waiting for a trigger event to liberate it. Fire stimulates release and germination of seeds of the jack pine, and also enriches the forest floor with wood ash and removes competing vegetation. Similarly, a number of angiosperms including Acacia cyclops and Acacia mangium have seeds that germinate better after exposure to high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The typical summer {{weather pattern}} is for heat-produced thermals, powered {{by either the}} Gulf or Atlantic sea breeze (and {{occasionally}} both simultaneously), to build puffy white cumulus clouds into threatening thunderheads over {{the interior of the}} Florida peninsula. Usually, the resulting storms drift slowly westward to the bay area, though they may rain themselves out before reaching Tampa if the easterly winds <b>are</b> <b>light</b> or the sea breeze from the Gulf of Mexico is too strong. Occasionally, the storms survive to move out over the Gulf of Mexico, where they can be seen at night from the beaches as spectacular light shows. Nighttime storms offshore are driven by the land-breeze front which is the dermal counterpart of the daytime sea-breeze front.|$|E

50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is about 11 mm. The forewings are buff with a diffuse yellow costal margin. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>lighter</b> than the forewing, without any darkening. In females, the hindwings <b>are</b> <b>lighter</b> than in males.|$|R
5|$|Aberrations in {{the shape}} of {{operculum}} have been observed. In a specimen from Vouvant in France, and another from a spring near Bar in Montenegro, a double rib was present, but the rib shield was reduced; in a specimen from Ohrid Lake, only the rib shield was reduced. Theodoxus fluviatilis can be distinguished from the other three mentioned species by having a rib pit, which is formed by the rib and the rib shield. The rib shield, and consequently a rib pit, are lacking in Theodoxus transversalis, Theodoxus danubialis and Theodoxus prevostianus. These three species differs in having, in addition to a rib, a peg, which is absent in T. fluviatilis. The visible soft parts of the animal <b>are</b> <b>light</b> yellow with a black head. The tentacles are greyish and long. The eyes are large and black; the foot is whitish.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles {{are similar}} to the adult female, but deeper brown below and paler above, with paler and less defined supercilia. Juveniles have broader buff feather edges, and tend to have looser, scruffier plumage, like {{moulting}} adults. Juvenile males tend to have darker throats and white postoculars like adult males, while juvenile females tend to have white throats. However, juveniles cannot be reliably sexed by plumage: some juvenile males lack any markings of the adult male, and some juvenile females have male features. The bills of young birds <b>are</b> <b>light</b> yellow to straw, paler than the female's bill. Immature males have paler versions of the adult male's markings, which can be very indistinct in fresh plumage. By their first breeding season, young birds generally are indistinguishable from other adults, though they may still be paler during their first year.|$|E
5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} Uruguayan Hippeastrum petiolatum, are sterile {{and unable}} to produce seeds. H. petiolatum is a sterile {{triploid}} that reproduces asexually, producing many bulbils around the mother bulb. These <b>are</b> <b>light,</b> and easily carried {{on the surface of}} water ensuring distribution of the species during the rainy season. Other species such as Hippeastrum reticulatum are self-pollinating, reproducing by distributing seed. Although this does not guarantee genetic diversity in natural populations, it is widely used by colonising species. These two examples are not however typical of the genus, which commonly reproduces through allogamy. One mechanism that limits self-pollination is that of self-incompatibility by which seeds are only produced by pollination from other plants. Furthermore, the plant generally releases its pollen about two days before its stigma is receptive, making cross-pollination more likely. Pollinators include Humming birds in subtropical areas, and moths.|$|E
