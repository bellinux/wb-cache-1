5|$|In November 2009 Cameron {{and others}} {{distributed}} free copies of an altered version of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species {{on college campuses}} in the United States. The book consisted of Darwin's text with chapters of the book removed, and with an added introduction by Ray Comfort reiterating common creationist assertions about Darwin and evolution. The book was criticized by scientists and Darwin biographers who criticized the omission of key chapters of the book, and who stated that its introduction contains misinformation about Darwin, and long-refuted creationist arguments <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>science</b> of evolution, such as the linking of Nazi racial theories to Darwinist ideas. Comfort later said that the four chapters were chosen at random to be omitted {{in order to make}} the book small enough to be affordable as a giveaway, with the absent chapters available for download, but that the missing chapters were included in the second edition, which had a smaller text size that made printing the entire book as a giveaway affordable. The second edition still lacks Darwin's preface and glossary of terms. The National Center for Science Education arranged a campaign to distribute an analysis of the Comfort introduction and a banana bookmark at colleges across the U.S., a reference to Comfort's presentation of the banana as an argument for the existence of God.|$|E

25|$|There were {{publications}} describing technology. Encyclopaedias such as Harris's Lexicon Technicum (1704) and Abraham Rees's Cyclopaedia (1802–1819) contain much of value.

25|$|There is also {{a drastic}} lack of {{education}} given to governments, farmers, and the community <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>science</b> behind GM crops, as well as suitable growing practices. In most relief programs, farmers are given seeds with little explanation and little {{attention is paid to}} the resources available to them or even laws that prohibit them from distributing produce. Governments are often not advised on the economic and health implications that come with growing GM crops, and are then left to make judgments on their own. Because they have so little information regarding these crops, they usually shy away from allowing them or do not take the time and effort required to regulate their use. Members of the community that will then consume the produce from these crops are also left in the dark about what these modifications mean and are often scared off by their 'unnatural' origins. This has resulted in failure to properly grow crops as well as strong opposition to the unknown practices.|$|E
40|$|The globalised {{digital media}} {{ecosystem}} can be characterised as both dynamic and disruptive. Developments in digital technologies relate closely to emerging social practices. In turn these are influencing, and are influenced by, {{the political economy}} of professional media and user-generated content, and the introduction of political and institutional governance and policies. Together this wider context provides opportunities and challenges for science communication practitioners and researchers. The globalised digital media ecosystem allows for, but does not guarantee, that a wider range of range of contributors can participate in storytelling <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>sciences.</b> At <b>the</b> same time, new tools are emerging that facilitate novel ways of representing digital data. As a result, researchers are reconceptualising ideas <b>about</b> <b>the</b> relationship between practices of production, content and consumption. In this paper I briefly explore whether storytelling <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>sciences</b> is becoming more distributed and participatory, shifting from communication to conversation and confrontation...|$|R

At the school, Keiko teaches her class <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>science</b> of the Bajoran wormhole and the aliens that live inside it. This scientific view {{is different from the}} religious approach taken by the Bajorans, who believe the wormhole is the legendary Celestial Temple inhabited by their [...] "Prophets", whom they worship as gods. Her class is interrupted by one of Bajor's spiritual leaders, Vedek Winn (Louise Fletcher). Winn questions why Keiko doesn't teach Bajoran religion in her classroom. Afterwards, Keiko reports the incident to Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks). When Sisko asks Winn about the dispute, she says there may be consequences if Keiko refuses to teach religion. Meanwhile, Miles discovers an important engineering tool is missing, but is distracted when he and Neela discover the remains of a Starfleet ensign.|$|E

500|$|Scully goes to warn Fellig that he {{is about}} to be charged for murder, and accuses him of {{profiting}} from people's deaths. In his darkroom, Fellig shows Scully a photo of a dead woman with an odd fuzzy shape around her head, which the photographer claims is Death. When asked why he bothers to try to photograph Death, Fellig says that it is so he can look Death in the face and finally die. He claims to be 149 years old, and says he cannot kill himself. Scully points out that most people would like to live forever, but Fellig says that he has experienced everything, and that even love does not last forever. Suddenly, he notices that Scully is gray, and says, [...] "Count your blessings." [...] When she asks <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>science</b> of his immortality, he says he was meant to die of yellow fever, but he refused to look Death in the face, so instead Death took the kind nurse who had taken care of him. [...] Fellig takes a photo just as Ritter enters and shoots. The bullet passes right through the camera and through Fellig into Scully, who collapses. While Ritter rushes to call an ambulance, Fellig asks Scully whether she saw Death and begs her to close her eyes. He covers her hand with his own. The color returns to Scully's hand as Fellig's turns gray. Looking up, he dies.|$|E
500|$|The {{stories in}} Scientific Detective Monthly were almost always detective stories, {{but they were}} only {{occasionally}} science fiction, as {{in many cases the}} science appearing in the stories already had practical applications. In the first issue, for example, [...] "The Mystery of the Bulawayo Diamond", by Arthur B. Reeve, mentions unusual science, but the mystery is solved by use of a bolometer to detect a blush on the face of a black girl. [...] The murderer in [...] "The Campus Murder Mystery", by Ralph W. Wilkins, freezes the body to conceal the manner of death; a chemical catalyst and electrical measurements of palm sweat provide the scientific elements in two other stories in the same issue. The only genuine science fiction story in the first issue is [...] "The Perfect Counterfeit" [...] by Captain S.P. Meek, in which a matter duplicator has been used to counterfeit paper money. [...] Van Dine's Philo Vance novel, The Bishop Murder Case, began serialization in the first issue, which probably assisted sales, since the hardcover edition of the novel, which had appeared only a few months previously, had sold well. [...] It was not science fiction, however, and throughout the magazine's run, only one or two stories per issue include elements that would qualify them as science fiction. [...] Mike Ashley, a historian of the field, suggests that Gernsback was more interested in stories <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>science</b> of detection than in imaginary science: most of Scientific Detective Monthlys contents were gadget stories, of a kind which Gernsback had been publishing in his other magazines for some time. [...] The cover for the first issue, by Jno Ruger, showed a detective using an electronic device to measure the reactions of a suspect.|$|E
