5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; {{he is not}} only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I have, my dear friend, determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them I feel that vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E

[...] "John" [...] took me outside <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> his orders were to {{eliminate}} them both, because Petacci knew many things. I said I could not shoot Petacci, so John said he would shoot her himself, while making it quite clear that Mussolini however, had to be killed by an Italian.|$|E

Her generosity gave me my life back." ...|$|E
500|$|Scurvy curs! {{they were}} my abhorrence; I should have liked {{nothing better than to}} have been the death of every one of them. In fact, on one occasion, I intimated the propriety of a canine crusade to Mehevi; but the benevolent king would not consent to it. He heard me very patiently; but when I had finished, shook his head, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> in confidence, that they were [...] "taboo".|$|E

500|$|Inspired by the {{aspirations}} of Knowles's father Mathew, the album was titled after Hadley Street, a plot of land in downtown Houston: [...] "My father took me there one day <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{he was going to}} build a studio," [...] {{she said in an interview}} with the Daily Mail. [...] "The title is a tribute to his vision. He had a plan and he saw it through. That was a real eye-opener for me.

500|$|Author Katherine V. Forrest claimed Bannon and {{her books}} [...] "are {{in a class}} by themselves" [...] and credits Bannon with saving her life, writing in 2005, [...] "Overwhelming need led me to walk a {{gauntlet}} of fear up to the cash register. Fear so intense that I remember nothing more, only that I stumbled out of the store in possession of what I knew I must have, a book as necessary to me as air... I found it when I was eighteen years old. It opened the door to my soul <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> who I was." ...|$|E
500|$|When J. Robert Oppenheimer {{began working}} on the nuclear weapon design for the Manhattan Project during World War II, Lawrence loaned Greene {{part-time}} to take dictation and do general secretarial work for Oppenheimer, while still working full-time for himself. [...] "When Robert returned from travel <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{that he had just}} been to a beautiful place, all I could say is, 'take me too!'" [...] she later recalled. Lawrence reluctantly let her go. She immediately started working for Oppenheimer full-time, taking over the disused office of a physics professor who was absent on leave in November 1942.|$|E

[...] After hearing Beck's record, Allman [...] "loved that slide part <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{he was going to}} learn to play it", Hornsby recalled. [...] In 1970, Joe Walsh adapted the slide-guitar section of [...] "Beck's Bolero" [...] for a James Gang song.

[...] His other daughter Sarah told Sellers her thoughts about the incident and he sent her a telegram that read [...] "After what happened this morning with Victoria, I shall be happy if I never hear from you again. I won't tell you what I think of you. It must be obvious. Goodbye, Your Father." ...|$|E
500|$|Oxford cox Acer Nethercott said [...] "Our bowman {{came off}} {{his seat and}} could not {{continue}} properly – it was race over after that." [...] Regarding the rejected appeal, he claimed that the umpire [...] "had laid down to both coxes before the race {{that there was a}} way he wanted to conduct the race.

The Secret Service came in <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> there had been an attack on the main gate."

500|$|On September 19, Dannemann {{spoke with}} a {{journalist}} for the German tabloid Bild. During the interview, published on September 24, Dannemann stated: [...] "I loved him, and Jimi loved me... We were already engaged... I would then have designed the sleeves for his records... He could not sleep. So I gave him the tablets."

500|$|Faced with a {{mortgage}} and a $2,000-per-month alimony obligation {{as a result}} of his 1969 divorce, he began to support himself largely by giving college lectures and appearances at science fiction conventions. [...] According to Arthur C. Clarke, [...] "After attending , Gene introduced himself <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that his series was being cancelled because the television executives, in their inscrutable wisdom, had decided that there was no audience for it. Poor Gene was broke and about to mortgage his home. I introduced him to my lecture agent, who was skeptical but booked him into a small hall -- which couldn't hold the audience he attracted." [...] Although the geographical distance imposed by Clarke's residence in Sri Lanka resulted in only a handful of physical meetings, Roddenberry would later characterize their friendship as [...] "the most significant of my professional life.” ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{featured}} several elaborate CGI scenes. The {{first scene}} with the vertebrae was entirely computer generated by visual effects head John Wash. Alex Krycek {{was killed by a}} CGI bullet straight through the head, which again was Manners' idea. Extra money was budgeted for Krycek's death. Mitch Pileggi was very happy when he was told he would be killing Krycek; he explained, [...] "when they came to me <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that I was the one that was going to kill Krycek, I was elated. Not because I wanted Nick to go away or anything, it was just from a character stand-point; Skinner just wanted to kill Krycek so bad." [...] Manners later called it one of his [...] "favorite scenes [...] ever directed" [...] and one of the [...] "best scenes [...] {{seen in a long time}} on television." ...|$|E
500|$|NHRA ranked him 14th {{on their}} Top 50 drivers in 2001. He was {{inducted}} in the NHRA Drag Racing Hall of Fame in 1978, and the Texas Motor Sports Hall of Fame in 2007.

After he was notified of his nomination, he said [...] "It's so much more satisfying to get this award now than posthumously. This way I'll be able to enjoy it. Honestly, it was a sobering moment when they called <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> I was being inducted along with some of the people I admired most growing up. It gives you reason to pause for a moment and reflect that maybe some good was accomplished along the way." ...|$|E

[...] At a final meeting at the Anhalter Bahnhof in Berlin, Steinhauer repeated his warnings, but Lody [...] "only laughed at me <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> my fears were groundless." [...] Steinhauer regarded Lody's ability to carry out his mission as [...] "practically nil" [...] and warned the Chief of Naval Intelligence not to send him to the UK, but the warning went unheeded. He recalled that [...] "as he had specially volunteered for the task– and I must admit there were very few people in Berlin just then anxious to accompany him– they allowed him to go." ...|$|E
