5|$|Glassmakers {{throughout}} history have experimented with glass fibers, but mass {{manufacture of glass}} fiber was only made possible with the invention of finer machine tooling. In 1893, Edward Drummond Libbey exhibited a dress at the World's Columbian Exposition incorporating glass fibers with the diameter <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> silk fibers. Glass fibers can also occur naturally, as Pele's hair.|$|E
5|$|Texas Tech's College of Agricultural Science and Natural Resources has {{received}} {{state and federal}} grants for research projects including the fiber properties of cotton, the antibacterial properties of cotton fabric, {{and the development of}} chemical-warfare protective fabrics. The college has also created two grass variants, Shadow Turf, a drought-tolerant turf grass that thrives in shade, and Tech Turf (marketed as Turffalo), a turf grass with the rich color <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> Bermuda and the resilience of buffalo grass.|$|E
5|$|Gaza's cuisine is {{characterized}} by its generous use of spices and chillies. Other major flavors and ingredients include dill, chard, garlic, cumin, lentils, chickpeas, pomegranates, sour plums and tamarind. Many of the traditional dishes rely on clay pot cooking, which preserves the flavor <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> the vegetables and results in fork-tender meat. Traditionally, most Gazan dishes are seasonal and rely on ingredients indigenous to the area and its surrounding villages. Poverty has also {{played an important role}} in determining many of the city's simple meatless dishes and stews, such as saliq wa adas ("chard and lentils") and bisara (skinless fava beans mashed with dried mulukhiya leaves and chilies).|$|E

5|$|Materials for the building's {{exterior}} {{were chosen}} with careful precision. To match the look <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> the original gallery's marble walls, builders re-opened the quarry in Knoxville, Tennessee, {{from which the}} first batch of stone had been harvested. The project even found and hired Malcolm Rice, a quarry supervisor who had overseen the original 1941 gallery project. The marble was cut into three-inch-thick panels and arranged over the concrete foundation, with darker blocks {{at the bottom and}} lighter blocks on top.|$|E
5|$|Aureoboletus mirabilis {{differs from}} other boletes in the {{covering}} of the cap, which superficially resembles that {{found on the}} surface of Boletellus ananas and Strobilomyces strobilaceus, but the scales are more rigid with a somewhat conical shape. It can be distinguished from these two species by both its bay-brown color, and the absence of a veil. Both of the other species mentioned possess a conspicuous veil, and the former is tan to brown with a pinkish tint, while the latter is dark brown or black. Boletus edulis is separated from A.mirabilis by the color <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> the cap, tubes and stem. Boletus coniferarum turns blue when bruised and has a very bitter taste. Aureoboletus projectellus is also similar in appearance to Aureoboletus mirabilis, but is found in eastern North America.|$|E
5|$|Géricault {{chose to}} depict this event {{in order to}} launch his career with a {{large-scale}} uncommissioned work on a subject that had already generated great public interest. The event fascinated him, and before he began work on the final painting, he undertook extensive research and produced many preparatory sketches. He interviewed two of the survivors and constructed a detailed scale model of the raft. He visited hospitals and morgues where he could view, first-hand, the colour <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> {{the flesh of the}} dying and dead. As he had anticipated, the painting proved highly controversial at its first appearance in the 1819 Paris Salon, attracting passionate praise and condemnation in equal measure. However, it established his international reputation, and today is widely seen as seminal in the early history of the Romantic movement in French painting.|$|E

5|$|The 1499 Madonna {{panel is}} a free adaption, in that the artist has changed and repositioned a number of elements. However, art historians usually agree that they are to the {{detriment}} of the balance and impact of the composition. The panel attributed to Gossaert shows even more significant, though perhaps more successful, alterations, including shifting the centre of balance by adding a section to the right-hand side, dressing the Virgin entirely in dark blue and changing her facial features. Both copies omit the two pools of bright light on the floor across from her, thus removing the mystical element of van Eyck's original, perhaps because its significance was not grasped by the later artists. That Gossaert followed other aspects of the original so closely, however, is evidence of the high regard he held for van Eyck's technical and aesthetic ability, and his version has been seen by some as a homage. The Master of 1499's admiration for van Eyck can be seen in his left-hand panel, which contains many features reminiscent of van Eyck's Arnolfini Portrait, including the rendering of the ceiling beams and the colour <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> the red fabrics.|$|E
5|$|The color <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> the coyote's fur varies {{somewhat}} geographically. The hair's predominant {{color is}} light gray and red or fulvous, interspersed {{around the body}} with black and white. Coyotes living at high elevations {{tend to have more}} black and gray shades than their desert-dwelling counterparts, which are more fulvous or whitish-gray. The coyote's fur consists of short, soft underfur and long, coarse guard hairs. The fur of northern subspecies is longer and denser than in southern forms, with the fur of some Mexican and Central American forms being almost hispid (bristly). Generally, adult coyotes (including coywolf hybrids) have a sable coat color, dark neonatal coat color, bushy tail with an active supracaudal gland, and a white facial mask. Albinism is extremely rare in coyotes; {{out of a total of}} 750,000 coyotes harvested by federal and cooperative hunters between March22, 1938, and June30, 1945, only two were albinos.|$|E

A slight difference of colour <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> the sandstone on the internal walls marks the division {{between the first and second}} stage of building.|$|E
25|$|Pasta {{manufacturing}} {{machines were}} made since the 1600s across {{the coast of}} Sanremo. The extrusion press produced large amounts of uniform pastas.

This technology spread to other areas including Genoa, Apulia, Brindisi, Bari, and Tuscany. By 1867, Buitoni Company in Sansepolcro, Tuscany in the upper Tiber Valley {{became one of the most}} successful and well-known pasta manufacturers in the world.|$|E
25|$|Some {{octopuses}} can use {{muscles in}} the skin to change both the colour <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> their mantle to achieve a greater camouflage. In some species, the mantle can take on the spiky appearance of seaweed, or the scraggly, bumpy texture of a rock, among other disguises. A few species, such as the mimic octopus, have another defence mechanism. They can combine their highly flexible bodies with their colour-changing ability to accurately mimic other, more dangerous animals, such as lionfish, sea snakes, and eels.|$|E

25|$|Pure {{sucralose}} {{is sold in}} bulk, but not in quantities {{suitable for}} individual use, although some highly concentrated sucralose–water blends are available online. These concentrates contain one part sucralose for each two parts water. A quarter teaspoon of concentrate substitutes for one cup of sugar. Pure, dry sucralose undergoes some decomposition at elevated temperatures. In solution or blended with maltodextrin, it is slightly more stable. Most products containing sucralose add fillers and additional sweetener to bring the product to the approximate volume <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> an equivalent amount of sugar.|$|E
25|$|Ripened or aged raw pǔ'ěr has {{occasionally}} been mistakenly {{categorized as}} a subcategory of black tea {{due to the}} dark red color of its leaves and liquor. However, pǔ'ěr in both its ripened and aged forms has undergone secondary oxidization and fermentation caused both by organisms growing in the tea and free-radical oxidation, thus making it a unique type of tea. This divergence in production style not only makes the flavor <b>and</b> <b>texture</b> <b>of</b> pu'er tea different but also results in a rather different chemical makeup of the resulting brewed liquor.|$|E
25|$|In September 1981, a major {{controversy}} {{broke out}} over the actions of Carol B. Thompson, director of the District of Columbia Office of Historic Preservation (DCHPO).
