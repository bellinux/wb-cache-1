500|$|Strong {{support in}} Montreal, and the {{response}} in Ottawa after the games were moved to the national capital left Eagleson increasingly confident in the tournament's future. The 1981 Canada Cup turned a profit of about C$1 million to be split between Hockey Canada and the National Hockey League Players Association pension fund, one third that of the 1976 tournament. Shortly after the tournament ended, Eagleson confirmed he intended to hold a third Canada Cup. [...] He noted that Canada's loss in the final {{played a role in}} his decision: [...] "As far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned</b> personally, it's probably preferable that we lost. [...] I think if we had won, I'd have said, 'To hell with it'." ...|$|E
2500|$|More {{than three}} years after the crash, the British coroner cited the [...] "flagrant {{disregard}} for passenger safety" [...] by the airline and said [...] "the primary failure so far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned</b> relates to the corporate culture which prevailed both One-Two-GO Airlines and Orient Thai Airlines prior to and following the air crash." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 2012, both Lynott's {{mother and}} widow objected to Mitt Romney's use of [...] "The Boys Are Back in Town" [...] during his {{election}} campaign. In {{an interview with}} Irish rock magazine Hot Press, Philomena Lynott said, [...] "As far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned,</b> Mitt Romney's opposition to gay marriage and to civil unions for gays makes him anti-gay – which {{is not something that}} Philip would have supported." ...|$|E

What you are left with is human movement, {{which is not a}} matter for the institute, it’s a police matter. It’s very, very unlikely that it could be spread by accident. People do not spread the disease easily." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since the war , Jews have {{occupied}} {{the villages of}} Maramureş and Bukovina, and gained the absolute majority in the towns and cities in Bessarabia. [...] It would be absurd to expect Jews to resign themselves {{in order to become}} a minority with certain rights and very many duties—after they have tasted the honey of power and conquered as many command positions as they have. Jews are currently fighting with all forces to maintain their positions, expecting a future offensive—and, as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned,</b> I understand their fight and admire their vitality, tenacity, genius.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{composed}} {{during a period}} of personal difficulty for Eliot—his marriage was failing, and both he and Vivienne were suffering from nervous disorders. The poem is often read as a representation of the disillusionment of the post-war generation. Before the poem's publication as a book in December 1922, Eliot distanced himself from its vision of despair. On 15 November 1922, he wrote to Richard Aldington, saying, [...] "As for The Waste Land, that is {{a thing of the past}} so far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned</b> and I am now feeling toward a new form and style." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{a meeting}} of the Dakota, the U.S. {{government}} and local traders, the Dakota representatives asked the representative of the government traders, Andrew Jackson Myrick, to sell them food on credit. His response was said to be, [...] "So far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned,</b> if they are hungry let them eat grass or their own dung." [...] But the context of Myrick's comment at the time, early August 1862, is historically unclear. Another version is that Myrick was referring to the Indian women who were already combing the floor of the fort's stables for any unprocessed oats to then feed to their starving children along with a little grass.|$|E
2500|$|Stood on his head: This {{is a term}} to {{describe}} an outstanding performance by an ice hockey goaltender {{in a short period}} of time. Often when a goalie lets out a rebound, the opposition returns the shot quickly, and the goalie has to make a quick save. A goalie often falls on his side and [...] "stacks the pads" [...] and appears to nearly stand on their head. The term may have been derived after NHL President Frank Calder, alluding to the 1918 rules change that permitted goalies to leave their feet to make a save, remarked, [...] "As far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned,</b> they can stand on their head(s)." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 23, 2009, The Advocate interviewed Braun {{about her}} {{portrayal}} of Reese and the Reese and Bianca storyline. [...] "From {{my point of}} view, Reese is {{not in love with}} Zach and she never has been," [...] said Braun. [...] "As far as the kiss, any doubt she may have had about her relationship with Bianca dissolved immediately after it happened. It was a moment of needing a connection. It was not about being in love with Zach. She was drunk, upset, and it was unfortunate. It was a terrible mistake. As far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned,</b> Reese has always been in love with Bianca." ...|$|E

2500|$|Morrison {{has stated}} that he was {{uncertain}} whether his Superman and the version featured in All Star Batman & Robin are the same due to the dramatic time {{differences between the two}} books: [...] "I don’t know if it would have worked. For me, I guess I do see it all taking place in the same world even though they seem like very different characters. Frank Miller is doing Batman {{at the beginning of his}} career and I am doing Superman at the very end of his life, in the years beyond All Star Batman. But it could be the same character as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned.</b> That’s where they may have ended up." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Denis O'Brien {{is often}} newsworthy, the Sunday Independent has paid {{particular}} attention to him when his business activities conflicted with Independent News Media. Denis O'Brien has perceived bias in the Independent Group's coverage and in a 2003 letter to Gavin O'Reilly wrote [...] "As far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned,</b> Independent News and Media {{have spent the last}} seven years trying to destroy my reputation. Some of the coverage of my affairs, both business and personal, in the Sunday Tribune, Sunday Independent, Irish Independent and Evening Herald have caused hurt and enormous damage to my reputation, not to mention the emotional distress suffered by my wife, Catherine and my family. I very much doubt whether you or your family could have survived a similar onslaught." ...|$|E
2500|$|Egar {{remained}} outspoken about bowling {{actions that}} he considered to be dubious in his later life. He has been strongly critical of {{the action of the}} Sri Lankan world record-breaking spinner Muttiah Muralitharan. In 2002, he criticised Wisden for ranking Muralitharan the best bowler in Test history, citing his bowling action. After Muralitharan broke the world record for career Test dismissals, Egar said [...] "As far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned</b> they should have a separate record for bowlers with illegal actions...I've got a photo at home of Murali's arm bending at 48 degrees." [...] Egar criticised laboratory tests on Muralitharan at the University of Western Australia as [...] "rubbish...The only tests that matter are those conducted under match conditions...The administrators of the game have got to take the blame for letting his action go." ...|$|E

2500|$|Merezkovsky, Gippius, Filosofov and Zlobin headed {{first for}} Minsk, then Vilno, staying in both cities to give {{newspaper}} interviews and public lectures. Speaking to a Vilno correspondent, Merezhkovsky commented:The {{whole question of}} Russia's existence as such — and it's non-existent at the moment, as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned,</b> — depends on Europe's recognizing at last {{the true nature of}} Bolshevism. Europe has to open its eyes to the fact that Bolshevism uses the Socialist banner only as a camouflage; that what it does in effect is defile high Socialist ideals; that it is a global threat, not just local Russian disease. ...There is not a trace in Russia at the moment of either Socialism or even the [...] dictatorship of proletariat; the only dictatorship that's there is that of the two people: Lenin and Trotsky.|$|E
2500|$|The {{redesign}} was criticised by {{some for}} having no specifically Welsh symbol (such as the Welsh Dragon), because the Royal Shield {{does not include}} a specifically Welsh symbol. Wrexham MP Ian Lucas, who was also campaigning to have the Welsh Dragon included on the Union Flag, called the omission [...] "disappointing", and stated {{that he would be}} writing to the Queen to request that the Royal Standard be changed to include Wales. The Royal Mint stated that [...] "the Shield of the Royal Arms is symbolic of the whole of the United Kingdom and as such, represents Wales, Scotland, England and Northern Ireland." [...] Designer Dent stated [...] "I am a Welshman and proud of it, but I never thought about the fact we did not have a dragon or another representation of Wales on the design because as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned</b> Wales is represented on the Royal Arms. This was never an issue for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Snow {{wrote that}} Lou Rowan was 'utterly unable to {{distinguish}} between a delivery short of a length which rise around {{the height of the}} rib cage and a genuine bouncer which goes through head high'. and believed that chest high balls were not intimidatory. However, English umpire Dickie Bird wrote [...] "as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned,</b> intimidatory bowling is the fast, short pitched ball into the region of the batsman's ribcage. When such a ball is fired in it is then that I feel an umpire must be firm...and tell the bowler to cut it out...that's the killer ball, and that is when I always step in". As Snow hit tailenders Garth McKenzie and Terry Jenner on the head in the series and continually bowled short at the other Australian batsmen it was not unreasonable for the umpires to intervene. Snow thought this was partisanship as Alan Thomson was not called to book when he bowled bouncers at Snow and six in one eight-ball over against Ray Illingworth.|$|E

2500|$|Lee {{released}} a third EP of covers in May 2014, {{to celebrate his}} 92nd birthday, called Metal Knight, {{in addition to a}} cover of [...] "My Way", it contains [...] "The Toreador March", inspired by the opera Carmen, and the songs [...] "The Impossible Dream" [...] and [...] "I Don Quixote" [...] from the Don Quixote musical Man of La Mancha. Lee was inspired to record the latter songs because, [...] "as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned,</b> Don Quixote is the most metal fictional character that I know". His fourth EP and third annual Christmas release came in December 2014, as he put out [...] "Darkest Carols, Faithful Sing", a playful take on [...] "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing". He explained: [...] "It's light-hearted, joyful and fun... At my age, {{the most important thing for}} me is to keep active by doing things that I truly enjoy. I do not know how long I am going to be around, so every day is a celebration, and I want to share it with my fans." ...|$|E
2500|$|By way of {{explanation}} for this, on 19 September 1938 a statement {{was given to}} the Daily Express by Roland St John Braddell (1880–1966), then legal adviser in Malaya. He said: [...] "As far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned,</b> I should love to see the Sultan of Johore married to this most charming lady, Miss Lydia Hill." [...] He added that the Sultan could not marry at present because there was no mosque in Genoa where he was staying, because he could do nothing without the permission of the British Government, and because the Sultan was ill: [...] "He nearly died recently in Johore", having [...] "become ill with heart trouble and gout". The lawyer had been instructed to take his wife and daughter and accompany Cissie to Genoa, because she kept the Sultan [...] "cheered and tranquil". [...] She had performed an African dance for the Sultan, and accompanied him on a two-hour drive along the coast. Although the Sultan had previously announced an engagement in Malaya, the lawyer now said that he would inform the Press if and when any marriage were to occur. Such an engagement was not unique in east Kent in the 1930s. George Henry Milles-Lade, 4th Earl Sondes who lived at Sheldwich, married Pamela McDougall on 17 October 1939; she was understood to have been previously a Bluebell Girl.|$|E
2500|$|In Gambia, President Yahya Jammeh has led {{the call}} for {{legislation}} that would set laws against homosexuals that would be [...] "stricter than those in Iran", {{and that he would}} [...] "cut off the head" [...] of any gay or lesbian person discovered in the country. News reports indicated his government intended to execute all homosexuals in the country. In the speech given in Tallinding, Jammeh gave a [...] "final ultimatum" [...] to any gays or lesbians in the Gambia to leave the country. In a speech to the United Nations on 27 September 2013, Jammeh said that [...] "omosexuality in all its forms and manifestations which, though very evil, antihuman as well as anti-Allah, is being promoted as a human right by some powers", and that those who do so [...] "want {{to put an end to}} human existence". In 2014, Jammeh called homosexuals [...] "vermins" [...] by saying that [...] "We will fight these vermins called homosexuals or gays the same way we are fighting malaria-causing mosquitoes, if not more aggressively". He also went on to disparage the LGBT by saying that [...] "As far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>concerned,</b> LGBT can only stand for Leprosy, Gonorrhoea, Bacteria and Tuberculosis; all of which are detrimental to human existence". In 2015, in defiance of western criticism Jammeh intensified his anti-gay rhetoric, telling a crowd during an agricultural tour: [...] "If you do it [...] I will slit your throat—if you are a man and want to marry another man in this country and we catch you, no one will ever set eyes on you again, and no white person can do anything about it." ...|$|E
