5000|$|McCree {{was one of}} the few {{characters}} {{developed for}} the game based on a stereotype, often compared to the Man with No Name, but they developed his character and narratives to embrace that stereotype. Blizzard wanted McCree to be a hero strong against agile opponents and to counter close-range abilities, according to Geoff Goodman. To achieve this, McCree has seen a confusing sequence of buffs and nerfs in the months after the game's initial release, which led some to jokingly call him [...] "the most indecisive character" [...] of the game. Initially, his burst damage output and versatility on all ranges made him a popular pick in almost any situation, but after numerous tweaks, he lost his main role of a tank killer and became a somewhat ambiguous anti-flanker with additional long-range capability. When these updates were made, Kaplan said that they were necessary to bring more in line with their vision for McCree's role, saying that [...] "We want McCree to be a counter to people like Tracer, Genji and Reaper. What we're not crazy <b>about,</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> is the way in which McCree can absolutely shred tanks." ...|$|E
5000|$|We {{also set}} {{conservative}} underwriting standards for loans we finance {{to ensure the}} homebuyers can afford their loans over the long term. We sought to bring the standards we apply to the prime space to the subprime market with our industry partners primarily to expand our services to underserved families.Unfortunately, Fannie Mae-quality, safe loans in the subprime market did not become the standard, and the lending market moved away from us. Borrowers were offered a range of loans that layered teaser rates, interest-only, negative amortization and payment options and low-documentation requirements on top of floating-rate loans. In early 2005 we began sounding our concerns about this [...] "layered-risk" [...] lending. For example, Tom Lund, the head of our single-family mortgage business, publicly stated, [...] "One {{of the things we}} don't feel good <b>about</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> as we look into this marketplace is more homebuyers being put into programs that have more risk.

5000|$|I tested Libertys {{calculation}} by timing {{my reading}} of two short pieces, a fictional story and an analysis of national politics. The first one promised me I could read it in 5 minutes, 25 seconds. (It took me 4 minutes and 40 seconds.) Reading Time for the next was 5 minutes and 35 seconds. (For me, 4 minutes, 50 seconds.) Im not the fastest reader in the world, but I do have practice and education on my side, which leads me {{to the conclusion that}} the magazine got the average reading time <b>about</b> <b>right.</b> <b>Now</b> there is a difference between Clock Time and Experience Time. We say that [...] "Time dragged," [...] or that it [...] "Flew by." [...] Some stories read so well that they trap us in Story Time ("I couldnt put it down"). Others forces us to slog through dense verbiage, an experience where seconds can seem like minutes... In the 58 pages of Liberty magazine, there were 15 features marked by Approximate Reading Time. Rounded off to minutes, here they are in order: 21, 19, 14, 5, 17, 7, 4, 12, 5, 28, 7, 15, 8, 9, 7. Ill do the math: 178 minutes. Thats two minutes shy of three hours. That doesn’t count the time it would take to read the ads, the movie reviews, and do the crossword puzzle. Liberty magazine existed in a world without television and the Internet.

5000|$|One of {{his final}} {{projects}} was writing a three-hour-long adaptation of André Malraux's 1933 novel Man's Fate, about {{the early days of}} the Chinese Revolution. The story was to have focused on several Europeans living in Shanghai during the tragic turmoil that characterized the onset of China's Communist regime. [...] "The screenplay, I think, is the best one I've ever done," [...] Cimino once said, adding that he had [...] "half the money; we're trying to raise the other half." [...] The roughly $25 million project was to be filmed wholly on location in Shanghai and would have benefited from the support of China's government, which said it would provide some $2 million worth of local labor costs. Cimino had been scouting locations in China since 2001. [...] "There was never a better time to try to do Man's Fate", Cimino said, [...] "because Man's Fate is what it's all <b>about</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> It's about the nature of love, of friendship, the nature of honor and dignity. How fragile and important all of those things are in a time of crisis." [...] Martha De Laurentiis, who with her husband Dino helped produce Year of the Dragon and Desperate Hours with Cimino, read his script for Man's Fate and passed on it. [...] "If you edit it down, it could be a very tight, beautiful, sensational movie," [...] she said, [...] "but violent, and ultimately a subject matter that I don't think America is that interested in." ...|$|E

40|$|Up until now, we {{have been}} talking about {{maintaining}} data structures which could handle such familiar requests as asking it a query or requesting that it change its structure in some discrete way. Now we are going to change our focus to look at kinetic data structures, which change continuously. Basch*, Guibas, and Hershberger [1],[4] were the first ones to nail down the general rules for kinetic data structures in that paper. 11. 1 Kinetic Data Structures- General Rules • Values/weights/coordinates are continuous functions of time. We need to be careful with our usage of the word “time ” in this context. “Time” doesn’t refer to computational cost (ie: counting CPU operations), but rather denotes a more environmental sense of the word, as marked by a clock on the wall. • Maintain the data structure that would be built at any given instant. As an example, a kinetic data structure should be able to return to you if a node v exists now. Or if it exists now. How <b>about</b> <b>right</b> <b>now?</b> • The data structure changes discretely. We want to imagine our data structure as a function of time, not that there’s just some Genie popping in and rewriting data at will. That is, for the duration of some interval, our data structure remains fixed. Then, at some discrete moment, the structure changes as the result of some functions stored at its nodes. • Maintain a proof of correctness for the data structure. When a certificate fails, update the data structure and its proofs. Updates to correct failed certificates are assumed to take no wall-clock time, though it obviously must use some cpu cycles. Essentially, one would have to ensure that updates are resolved more quickly than the time it takes for the next query to reach the expired parts of the structure. Evaluation Criteria for Kinetic Data Structures 1. Responsive: When a certificate expires, we can update the data structure quickly (in O(log n) time) 2. Local: No object participates in many certificates, resulting in fast motion changes. 3. Compact: The number of certificates is small compared to a static data structure. 4. Efficient: # of events in data structure in the worst case # of necessary changes to keep maintained in worst cas...|$|E
