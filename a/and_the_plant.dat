5|$|In 1915, Conant {{entered into}} a {{business}} partnership with two other Harvard chemistry graduates, Stanley Pennock and Chauncey Loomis, to form the LPC Laboratories. They opened a plant in a one-story building in Queens, New York, where they manufactured chemicals used by the pharmaceutical industry like benzoic acid that were selling at high prices {{on account of the}} interruption of imports from Germany due to World War I. In 1916, the departure of organic chemist Roger Adams created a vacancy at Harvard that was offered to Conant. Since he aspired to an academic career, Conant accepted the offer and returned to Harvard. On November 27, 1916, there was an explosion at the plant. Pennock and two other workers were killed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> was completely destroyed. One of the contributing causes was Conant's faulty test procedures.|$|E
5|$|In early September Nichols {{appointed}} a production control committee, headed by Major A.V. (Pete) Peterson. Peterson's staff tried various combinations, using mechanical calculating machines, {{and decided that}} the S-50 production should be fed to K-25 rather than Y-12, which was done in April 1945. The charts also showed that the proposed top stages for K-25 should be abandoned, as should Lawrence's recommendation to add more alpha stages to the Y-12 plant. Groves accepted their proposal to add more base units to the K-27 gaseous-diffusion plant and one more Beta stage track for Y-12. These additions were estimated to cost $100 million, with completion in February 1946. Soon after Japan surrendered in August 1945, Peterson recommended that S-50 be shut down. The Manhattan District ordered this on 4 September. The last uranium hexafluoride was sent to K-25, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> had ceased operation by 9 September. S-50 was completely demolished in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all species}} in the genus Lactarius, L.subflammeus is mycorrhizal, forming mutualistic {{associations}} with trees. The fungus <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> forms structures called ectomycorrhizae, a specialized sheath of hyphae {{on the surface of}} the root from which hyphae extend into the soil and into the outer cortical cells of the root. The fruit bodies of L.subflammeus grow scattered to grouped under conifers or in mixed conifer-hardwood forests near pine and spruce, from August to December. The fungus is widely distributed in the Pacific Northwest, where it is very common in conifer forests. The habitat of the type location was coastal sand dunes under pine. States from which the fungus has been collected include Washington, Idaho, Oregon, California, and Colorado. The mushroom's range extends north into Canada, where it has been found near Victoria, British Columbia in coastal forests dominated by Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii).|$|E

5|$|Located at the {{junction}} of Sungei Road and Pitt Road, was the former site of the Singapore Ice Works that {{was built in the}} 1930s. The factory was the first ice-making plant in Singapore using large compressors manufactured mainly from Carrier and York corporations. It was popular as a pioneer establishment that brought refrigeration and air-conditioning to Singapore. In 1958, it was renamed as the New Singapore Ice Works. In later years, the factory was bought over by Cold Storage who ran it under their management. However, in 1984, the Housing Development Board (HDB) took over its site for redevelopment. The factory was soon demolished <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> operations was re-located to Auric Pacific at Fishery Port Road.

5|$|The plant {{witnesses}} {{a drop in}} {{its revenue}} due to lower sales of pesticides, {{and in order to}} reduce the loss the officials neglect safety and maintenance. Questioning the chemicals used in the plant, Motwani (Kal Penn), a tabloid reporter publishes reports in his makeshift printing press which are disregarded by most of the officials and workers. Roy (Joy Sengupta), the in-charge for the safety of the plant expresses his concerns. The officials however ignore his warnings, and a worker is killed when a drop of methyl isocyanate leaking from a pipeline lands on his arm. The officials deem the worker's irresponsibility as the cause of the accident <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> continues to function. Dilip is given a better-paying vacant job in the plant despite lacking the skill to operate machinery. A gas leak is prevented by Roy when water is mixed with methyl isocyanate, and in an attempt to stop people from panicking, the official in the plant sabotages the warning siren.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. {{based on}} the {{investigation}} of afforestation project in 2007 in Pingluo city of Ningxa province, this paper analyzed the change of salt concentration of soil <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>planting</b> survival rate, <b>and</b> then proposed <b>the</b> afforestation techniques system for saline-alkaline soil in northern Ningxia. The result showed that: (1) Under application of organic fertilizer and irrigation water to reduce salt concentration in the soil, the salt concentration of the soil depths of 10 cm to 30 cm and 30 cm to 50 cm were (1. 37 g/l), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>planting</b> surviving rates for Tamarix chinensis, Amorpha fruticosa, Elaeagnus angustifolia, and Populus euphratica were 75 %, 75. 4 %, 96. 8 % and 92. 6 % respectively. But with the film covering {{on the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>planting</b> hole <b>and</b> irrigating water to reducing salt, the salt concentrations for the two soil depths were all 1. 28 g/l, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>planting</b> surviving rate of D was only 11. 4 %. (2) Under elevating <b>the</b> <b>planting</b> surface <b>and</b> increasing <b>the</b> soil depth by 80 cm to 100 cm with the soil from trench, and application of organic fertilizer and irrigation water to reducing salt, the salt concentrations for two depth layers were around 0. 36 g/l, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>planting</b> surviving rates of Elaeagnus angustifolia, Sophora japonica, Tamarix chinensis, and Amorpha fruticosa were 84 / 1 %, 91. 1 ％, 99. 5 %, and 82. 5 % respectively.
