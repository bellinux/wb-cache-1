5|$|A {{number of}} factors affect whether dieting will affect these menstrual processes: age, weight loss and the diet itself. First, younger women are likely to {{experience}} menstrual irregularities due to their diet. Second, menstrual abnormalities are more likely with more weight loss. For example, <b>anovulatory</b> cycles can occur {{as a result of}} adopting a restricted diet, as well as engaging in a high amount of exercise. Finally, the cycle is affected more by a vegetarian diet compared to a non-vegetarian diet.|$|E
5|$|Elephants are {{polygynous}} breeders, and copulations {{are most}} frequent {{during the peak}} of the wet season. A cow in oestrus releases chemical signals (pheromones) in her urine and vaginal secretions to signal her readiness to mate. A bull will follow a potential mate and assess her condition with the flehmen response, which requires the male to collect a chemical sample with his trunk and bring it to the vomeronasal organ. The oestrous cycle of a cow lasts 14–16 weeks with a 4–6-week follicular phase and an 8- to 10-week luteal phase. While most mammals have one surge of luteinizing hormone during the follicular phase, elephants have two. The first (or <b>anovulatory)</b> surge, could signal to males that the female is in oestrus by changing her scent, but ovulation does not occur until the second (or ovulatory) surge. Fertility rates in cows decline around 45–50 years of age.|$|E

25|$|Hyperprolactinaemia, or excess serum prolactin, is {{associated}} with hypoestrogenism, <b>anovulatory</b> infertility, oligomenorrhoea, amenorrhoea, unexpected lactation and loss of libido in women and erectile dysfunction and loss of libido in men.|$|E
25|$|In <b>anovulatory</b> cycles using progestogen-only contraceptives, the {{endometrium}} is {{thin and}} atrophic. If the endometrium was also thin and atrophic during an ovulatory cycle, this could theoretically interfere with implantation of a blastocyst (embryo).|$|E
25|$|Finally, calendar-based methods {{assume that}} all {{bleeding}} is true menstruation. However, mid-cycle or <b>anovulatory</b> bleeding {{can be caused by}} a number of factors. Incorrectly identifying bleeding as menstruation will cause the method's calculations to be incorrect.|$|E
25|$|In most girls, {{menarche}} {{does not}} mean that ovulation has occurred. In postmenarchal girls, about 80% of the cycles were <b>anovulatory</b> in the first year after menarche, 50% in the third and 10% in the sixth year. Regular ovulation is usually indicated by predictable and consistent intervals between menses, predictable and consistent durations of menses, and predictable and consistent patterns of flow (e.g., heaviness or cramping). Continuing ovulation typically requires a body fat content of at least 22%. An anthropological term for this state of potential fertility is nubility.|$|E
25|$|Use {{of certain}} {{calendar}} rules {{to determine the}} length of the pre-ovulatory infertile phase allows unprotected intercourse during {{the first few days of}} the menstrual cycle while maintaining a very low risk of pregnancy. With mucus-only methods, there is a possibility of incorrectly identifying mid-cycle or <b>anovulatory</b> bleeding as menstruation. Keeping a BBT chart enables accurate identification of menstruation, when pre-ovulatory calendar rules may be reliably applied. In temperature-only systems, a calendar rule may be relied on alone to determine pre-ovulatory infertility. In symptothermal systems, the calendar rule is cross-checked by mucus records: observation of fertile cervical mucus overrides any calendar-determined infertility.|$|E
25|$|In women, menstrual {{disturbances}} {{are common}} during spironolactone treatment, with 10 to 50% of women experiencing them at moderate doses {{and almost all}} experiencing them at a high doses. Most women taking moderate doses of spironolactone develop amenorrhea, and normal menstruation usually returns within two months of discontinuation. Spironolactone produces an irregular, <b>anovulatory</b> pattern of menstrual cycles. It is also associated with metrorrhagia and menorrhagia (or menometrorrhagia) in {{a large percentage of}} women. It has no birth control effect. It has been suggested that the weak progestogenic activity of spironolactone is responsible for these effects, although this has not been established and spironolactone has been shown to possess insignificant progestogenic and antiprogestogenic activity even at high dosages in women. An alternative proposed cause is inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase and hence sex steroid metabolism by spironolactone and consequent changes in sex hormone levels.|$|E
25|$|The first menstrual {{bleeding}} {{is referred}} to as menarche, and typically occurs about two years after thelarche. The average age of menarche is 12.5 in the United States. Most American girls experience their first period at 11, 12 or 13, but some experience it earlier than their 11th birthday and others after their 14th birthday. In fact, anytime between 8 and 16 is normal. In Canada, the average age of menarche is 12.72, and in the United Kingdom it is 12.9. The time between menstrual periods (menses) is not always regular {{in the first two years}} after menarche. Ovulation is necessary for fertility, but may or may not accompany the earliest menses. In postmenarchal girls, about 80% of the cycles were <b>anovulatory</b> in the first year after menarche, 50% in the third year and 10% in the sixth year. Initiation of ovulation after menarche is not inevitable. A high proportion of girls with continued irregularity in the menstrual cycle several years from menarche will continue to have prolonged irregularity and anovulation, and are at higher risk for reduced fertility.|$|E
500|$|Infrequent or {{irregular}} ovulation {{is called}} oligoovulation. The absence of ovulation is called anovulation. Normal menstrual flow can occur without ovulation preceding it: an <b>anovulatory</b> cycle. In some cycles, follicular development may start but not be completed; nevertheless, estrogens will be formed and [...] stimulate the uterine lining. <b>Anovulatory</b> flow {{resulting from a}} very thick endometrium caused by prolonged, continued high estrogen levels is called estrogen breakthrough bleeding. <b>Anovulatory</b> bleeding triggered by a sudden drop in estrogen levels is called withdrawal bleeding. <b>Anovulatory</b> cycles commonly occur before menopause (perimenopause) and in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.|$|E

2500|$|Dysfunctional uterine {{bleeding}} is a hormonally caused bleeding abnormality. [...] Dysfunctional uterine bleeding typically {{occurs in}} premenopausal {{women who do}} not ovulate normally (i.e. are <b>anovulatory).</b> All these bleeding abnormalities need medical attention; they may indicate hormone imbalances, uterine fibroids, or other problems. As pregnant women may bleed, a pregnancy test forms part of the evaluation of abnormal bleeding.|$|E
2500|$|Pincus and McCormick enlisted Harvard {{clinical}} professor of gynecology John Rock, chief of gynecology at the Free Hospital for Women and {{an expert in the}} treatment of infertility, to lead clinical research with women. At a scientific conference in 1952, Pincus and Rock, who had known each other for many years, discovered they were using similar approaches to achieve opposite goals. In 1952, Rock induced a three-month <b>anovulatory</b> [...] "pseudo-pregnancy" [...] state in eighty of his infertility patients with continuous gradually increasing oral doses of estrogen (diethylstilbestrol 5–30mg/day) and progesterone (50–300mg/day) and within the following four months 15% became pregnant.|$|E
2500|$|In 1953, at Pincus' suggestion, Rock induced {{a three-month}} <b>anovulatory</b> [...] "pseudo-pregnancy" [...] state in twenty-seven of his {{infertility}} patients with an oral 300mg/day progesterone-only regimen for 20 days from cycle days 5–24 followed by pill-free days to produce withdrawal bleeding. This produced the same 15% pregnancy rate {{during the following}} four months without the amenorrhea of the previous continuous estrogen and progesterone regimen. But 20% of the women experienced breakthrough bleeding {{and in the first}} cycle ovulation was suppressed in only 85% of the women, indicating that even higher and more expensive oral doses of progesterone would be needed to initially consistently suppress ovulation.|$|E
50|$|For {{those who}} after weightloss still are <b>anovulatory</b> or for <b>anovulatory</b> lean women, {{ovulation}} induction {{to reverse the}} anovulation is the principal treatment used to help infertility in PCOS. Clomiphene citrate is the main medication used for this purpose, and is the first-line treatment in subfertile <b>anovulatory</b> patients with PCOS. Gonadotrophins such as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are, in addition to surgery, second-line treatments.|$|E

50|$|About 90% of DUB events {{occur when}} {{ovulation}} is not occurring (<b>Anovulatory</b> DUB). <b>Anovulatory</b> menstrual cycles are common at {{the extremes of}} reproductive age, such as early puberty and perimenopause (period around menopause). In such cases, women do not properly develop and release a mature egg. When this happens, the corpus luteum, which is a mound of tissue that produces progesterone, does not form. As a result, estrogen is produced continuously, causing an overgrowth of the uterus lining. The period is delayed in such cases, and when it occurs menstruation can be very heavy and prolonged. Sometimes <b>anovulatory</b> DUB {{is due to a}} delay in the full maturation of the reproductive system in teenagers. Usually, however, the mechanisms are unknown.|$|E

50|$|Normal menstrual {{bleeding}} in the ovulatory cycle {{is a result}} of a decline in progesterone due to the demise of the corpus luteum. It is thus a progesterone withdrawal bleeding.
