25|$|Epitope spreading, {{also known}} as {{determinant}} spreading, is another common way in which autoimmunity can occur which uses the molecular mimicry mechanism. Autoreactive T cells are activated de novo by self epitopes released secondary to pathogen-specific T cell-mediated bystander damage. T cell responses to progressively less dominant epitopes are activated {{as a consequence of}} the release of other antigens secondary to the destruction of the pathogen with a homologous immunodominant sequence. Thus, inflammatory responses induced by specific pathogens that trigger pro-inflammatory Th1 responses have the ability to persist in genetically susceptible hosts. This may lead to organ-specific autoimmune disease. Conversely, epitope spreading could be due to target antigens being physically linked intracellularly as members of a complex to self antigen. The result of this is an <b>autoimmune</b> <b>response</b> that is triggered by exogenous antigen that progresses to a truly <b>autoimmune</b> <b>response</b> against mimicked self antigen and other antigens. From these examples, it is clear that the search for candidate mimic epitopes must extend beyond the immunodominant epitopes of a given <b>autoimmune</b> <b>response.</b>|$|E

25|$|Despite {{no obvious}} amino acid {{sequence}} similarity from pathogen to host factors, structural studies have revealed that mimicry can still occur at the host level. In some cases, pathogenic mimics can possess a structural architecture that differs markedly {{from that of the}} functional homologues. Therefore, proteins of dissimilar sequence may have a common structure which elicits an <b>autoimmune</b> <b>response.</b> It has been hypothesized that these virulent proteins display their mimicry through molecular surfaces that mimic host protein surfaces (protein fold or three-dimensional conformation), which have been obtained by convergent evolution. It has also been theorized that these similar protein folds have been obtained by horizontal gene transfer, most likely from a eukaryotic host. This further supports the theory that microbial organisms have evolved a mechanism of concealment similar to that of higher organisms such as the African praying mantis or chameleon who camouflage themselves so that they can mimic their background as not to be recognized by others.|$|E
25|$|Myasthenia gravis {{is another}} common {{autoimmune}} disease. This disease causes fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue. The disease occurs due to detectable antibodies produced against the human acetylcholine receptor. The receptor contains a seven {{amino acid sequence}} (Trp-Thr-Tyr-Asp-Gly-Thr-Lys) in the α-subunit that demonstrates immunological cross-reactivity with a shared immunodominant domain of gpD of the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Similar to HIV-1, gpD also aids in binding to chemokines on the cell surface of the host to gain entry into the host. Cross-reactivity of the self epitope (α-subunit of the receptor) with antibodies produced against HSV suggests that the virus {{is associated with the}} initiation of myasthenia gravis. Not only does HSV cause immunologic cross-reactivity, but the gpD peptide also competitively inhibits the binding of antibody made against the α-subunit to its corresponding peptide on the α-subunit. Despite this, an <b>autoimmune</b> <b>response</b> still occurs. This further shows an immunologically significant sequence homology to the biologically active site of the human acetylcholine receptor.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{dissimilar}} {{sequence homology}} {{between self and}} foreign peptide, weak electrostatic interactions between foreign peptide and the MHC can also mimic self peptide to elicit an <b>autoimmune</b> <b>response</b> within the host. For example, charged residues can explain the enhanced on-rate and reduced off-rate of a particular antigen or can contribute to a higher affinity and activity for a particular antigen that can perhaps mimic that of the host. Similarly, prominent ridges {{on the floor of}} peptide-binding grooves can do such things as create C-terminal bulges in particular peptides that can greatly increase the interaction between foreign and self peptide on the MHC. Similarly, there has been evidence that even gross features such as acidic/basic and hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions have allowed foreign peptides to interact with an antibody or MHC and TCR. It is now apparent that sequence similarity considerations are not sufficient when evaluating potential mimic epitopes and the underlying mechanisms of molecular mimicry. Molecular mimicry, from these examples, has therefore been shown to occur {{in the absence of any}} true sequence homology.|$|E
40|$|Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) and {{depression}} {{are considered to}} be neuro-immune disorders (Maes and Twisk, BMC Medicine 8 : 35, 2010). There is also evidence that depression and ME/CFS are accompanied by oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS) and by increased autoantibodies to a number of self-epitopes some of which have become immunogenic due to damage by O&NS. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine IgM-mediated <b>autoimmune</b> <b>responses</b> to different self-epitopes in ME/CFS versus depression. We examined serum IgM antibodies to three anchorage molecules (palmitic and myristic acid and S-farnesyl-L-cysteine); acetylcholine; and conjugated NO-modified adducts in 26 patients with major depression; 16 patients with ME/CFS, 15 with chronic fatigue; and 17 normal controls. Severity of fatigue and physio-somatic (F&S) symptoms was measured with the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Rating Scale. Serum IgM antibodies to the three anchorage molecules and NO-phenylalanine were significantly higher in ME/CFS than in depression.

40|$|BioEM; BioELECInternational audienceBACKGROUND: There is {{evidence}} that depression is accompanied by oxidative and nitrosative stress (O&NS), as indicated by increased free radical levels, lipid peroxidation, and lowered antioxidant levels. The aims {{of the present study}} are to examine whether depression is accompanied by <b>autoimmune</b> <b>responses</b> directed against a) neoepitopes that are formed following O&NS damage; and b) the major anchorage molecules, i. e. palmitic and myristic acids and S-farnesyl-L-cysteine. METHODS: We examined serum IgM antibodies to the conjugated fatty acids, palmitic and myristic acids; acetylcholine; S-farnesyl-L-cysteine; and NO-modified adducts in 26 depressed patients and 17 normal controls. Severity of depression was measured with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and severity of fatigue and somatic (F&S) symptoms with the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (FF) Rating Scale. RESULTS: The prevalences and mean values for the serum IgM levels directed against conjugated palmitic and myristic acids, acetylcholine, S-farnesyl-L-cysteine; and the conjugated NO adducts, NO-tyrosine, NO-phenylalanine, NO-aspartate, NO-histidine, and NO-creatine were significantly higher in depressed patients than in normal controls. The <b>autoimmune</b> <b>responses</b> were significantly related to FF symptoms, such as fatigue and a flu-like malaise, whereas the indicants of nitrosative stress were related to gastro-intestinal and autonomic symptoms. DISCUSSION: Depression is characterized by IgM-related <b>autoimmune</b> <b>responses</b> directed against a) neoepitopes that are normally not detected by the immune system but that due to damage by O&NS have become immunogenic; and b) anchorage epitopes, i. e. palmitic and myristic acids, and S-farnesyl-L-cysteine.

The novel technique employs a droplet microfluidic device to encapsulate pancreatic islets in hydrogel made of alginate, a natural polymer extracted from seaweed. These capsules have a unique microstructure: a porous network and considerable amount of non-freezable water. Non-freezable bound water does not form ice due to the strong association between water molecules and the hydrogel networks. Hydrogel capsules with large amounts of non-freezable bound water protect the cells from the ice damage and {{reduce the need for}} cryoprotectants—special substances that minimise or prevent freezing damage and can be toxic in high concentrations. The hydrogel capsule allows small molecules, e.g. nutrients and islet secretions, to pass through the membrane easily, but prevents direct contact between implanted cells and host cells and so prevent an attack on transplants by the <b>autoimmune</b> <b>response.</b> The use of a real-time single-islet oxygen sensor – a fluorescent oxygen-sensitive dye in hydrogel capsules allows to use a simple and cheap yet reliable individual-islet-based quality control of viability for the entire islet processing procedure prior to transplantation.
