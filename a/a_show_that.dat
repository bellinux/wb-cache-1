5|$|After {{just over}} a year with Cheerleader, Rollason left the company to {{concentrate}} on her broadcasting career, and became a freelance reporter. She covered the 1987 World Student Games from Zagreb for Thames Television, and then presented the 1988 World Junior Athletics championships from Sudbury, Ontario for Channel 4. Later on in 1988, she provided coverage of that year's Summer Olympics, held in Seoul, for ITV. During the mid-1980s, she also joined the presenting team of the BBC children's news programme, Newsround, with a view to increasing its sports coverage, and presented several features on topics such as gymnastics and female jockeys, as well as presenting Newsround Extra, <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> covered a specific issue in more detail. One such programme was a report on the street children of Bogotá, a subject that deeply moved her and reduced her to tears on screen.|$|E
5|$|As Jesus vs. Santa {{became more}} popular, Parker and Stone began talks of {{developing}} the short into a television series. Fox refused {{to pick up the}} series, not wanting to air <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> included the character Mr. Hankey, a talking piece of feces. The two then entered negotiations with both MTV and Comedy Central. Parker preferred the show be produced by Comedy Central, fearing that MTV would turn it into a kids show. When Comedy Central executive Doug Herzog watched the short, he commissioned for it to be developed into a series.|$|E
5|$|Bound for Glory was {{received}} with mixed reviews. Canadian Online Explorer pro wrestling section writer Matt Bishop graded the event a 7 out of 10, {{the same as}} last year's event. He stated, “TNA's biggest show of the year, Bound For Glory, was a mix of good and bad. The show's biggest matches delivered on <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> featured a weak undercard”. He also gave the main event 8 out of 10, and the Lethal Lockdown match 7 out of 10. His lowest scores were for the Knockouts Title match that was given a 2 out of 10 and the Young-Jordan versus Neal-Moore match that was rated a dud.|$|E

5|$|On June 23, 2000, at 20:00, Bueno {{attended}} a taping of La Biblia y el Calefón hosted by Jorge Guinzburg on Canal 13. When the show ended at 22:45, Bueno {{went to the}} restaurant El Corralón in Buenos Aires' Palermo neighborhood, where he dined with his family, Fernando Olmedo (son of the comedian Alberto Olmedo) and comedian Pepe Parada. Olmedo remarked {{that he had never}} seen one of Bueno's shows, and Bueno invited him to <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> same night at the club Escándalo in La Plata. Bueno gave a two-and-a-half hour performance {{in front of an audience}} of 2,000.

5|$|The Itchy & Scratchy Show {{is a show}} within <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> appears {{occasionally}} in episodes of The Simpsons.

Itchy & Scratchy airs as a segment on The Krusty the Clown Show, and also aired on its brief replacements, Sideshow Bob's Cavalcade of Whimsy and Gabbo.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{episode is}} a satire of unoriginal, poor {{television}} writing and references and parodies many television series. When Troy McClure mentions that Fox can only fill up three slots {{for the next}} season, the three series are Melrose Place, The X-Files and The Simpsons itself. In the museum of television, Troy walks by posters of spin-offs, such as The Ropers (spun off from Three's Company), Laverne & Shirley (spun off from Happy Days), Rhoda, <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> Julie Kavner, the voice of Marge, once starred in, (spun off from The Mary Tyler Moore Show) and Fish (spun off from Barney Miller), to demonstrate the power of spin-offs. Troy walks by a poster of The Jeffersons (a spin-off of All in the Family) twice, because the writers {{could not think of}} any more spin-offs.|$|E

The episode features several notable guest appearances. Dan Castellaneta, {{best known as the}} voice of Homer Simpson on The Simpsons, appears as Dr. Kinny, a sociology professor. Rider Strong guest stars as a student who participates as a guard in the experiment. The episode features a guest appearance by Samm Levine, best known for his role on Freaks and Geeks. Levine had previously worked with series star Chris Lowell on Life as We Know It, <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> had been cancelled in 2005. Rachelle Lefevre, known for her later roles as Victoria in The Twilight Saga and in Under the Dome, guest stars as Marjorie, one of the sorority girls who becomes friends with Veronica.|$|E

Riley, however, was unable to agree with the Redpath Bureau who had to authorize any other performance under the terms of their contract. Riley believed his contract with Redpath Bureau was limiting his opportunities, and his relationship with his agent became strained.|$|E
5|$|With Saltimbanco {{finished}} and touring in the United States and Canada, Cirque du Soleil toured Japan {{in the summer}} of 1992 {{at the behest of the}} Fuji Television Network. Taking acts from Nouvelle Expérience and Cirque Réinventé, they created a show for this tour, titled Fascination. Although Fascination was never seen outside Japan, it represented the first time that Cirque du Soleil had produced <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> took place in an arena rather than a big top.

5|$|Neighbours is an Australian {{television}} soap opera. It {{was first}} broadcast on the Seven Network on 18 March 1985. It {{was created by}} TV executive Reg Watson, who proposed {{the idea of making}} <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> focused on realistic stories and portrayed adults and teenagers who talk openly and solve their problems together. Seven decided to commission the show following the success of Watson's Sons and Daughters, which aired on the network. Although successful in Melbourne, Neighbours underperformed in the Sydney market and struggled for months before Seven cancelled it. The show was immediately bought by rival network Ten. After taking over production of the show, the new network had to build replica sets because Seven destroyed the originals to prevent its rival from obtaining them. Ten began screening Neighbours on 20 January 1986, taking off where the previous series left off and commencing with episode 171. Neighbours has since become the longest running drama series in Australian television and in 2005, it was inducted collectively into the Logie Hall of Fame. On 11 January 2011, Neighbours moved to Ten's digital channel, Eleven.|$|E
5|$|The {{projector}} {{could be}} controlled by a console where an individual presenter would provide specific talks or lectures. By the mid-1970s, automation features were added, {{which led to the}} creation of prerecorded shows. Most visitors to the facility would have seen an automated 40- to 45-minute audio/visual show on a particular space-related topic. Two types of shows were typically alternated on a daily basis: one aimed at families with young children and another aimed at older children and adults. Typical shows aimed at both audience types were built around themes such as space travel, the mythical stories behind the constellations, and around Christmas-time, <b>a</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> investigated theories on stellar explanations for the Star of Bethlehem. A listing from 1970 includes shows titled The Story of Eclipses, which looked at how solar eclipses occur and their scientific importance, Man and the Zodiac which explored the history of mythology and astrology with regard to the night sky, and The Planet Venus which surveyed the history of the planet in mythology, the planet's motion across the sky and featured imagined views from its surface.|$|E
