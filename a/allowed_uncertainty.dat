We collected Quercus prinus tree-ring data from a dense forest in the Appalachians, and after removal of stand dynamics and age trends we found strong influence of early summer precipitation on annual tree growth. We used the new Q. prinus chronology in a nested principal component analysis (PCA) of southeastern US Q. prinus chronologies and further strengthened the early summer precipitation signal in the tree-growth proxy, with favorable assessment of reconstruction skill. Our reconstruction was modeled using Bayesian regression, which <b>allowed</b> <b>uncertainty</b> to be quantified. The May–June precipitation reconstruction covered the period 1750 - 1981 and extended the instrumental record by 150 yr.

This reconstruction has established a baseline precipitation record that can be used to measure changes brought about by global climate change.

40|$|Although {{asbestos}} represents today one of {{the most}} harmful contaminant on Earth, in 72 % of the countries worldwide only amphiboles are banned while controlled use of chrysotile is <b>allowed.</b> <b>Uncertainty</b> on the potential toxicity of chrysotile {{is due to the fact}} that the mechanisms by which mineral fibres induces cyto- and geno-toxic damage are still unclear. We have recently started a long term project aimed at the systematic investigation of the crystal-chemistry, bio-interaction and toxicity of the mineral fibres. This work presents a systematic structural investigation of iron in asbestos and erionite (considered the most relevant mineral fibres of social and/or economic-industrial importance) using synchrotron X-ray absorption and Mössbauer spectroscopy. In all investigated mineral fibres, iron in the bulk structure is found in octahedral sites and can be made available at the surface via fibre dissolution. We postulate that the amount of hydroxyl radicals released by the fibers depends, among other factors, upon their dissolution rate; in relation to this, a ranking of ability of asbestos fibres to generate hydroxyl radicals, resulting from available surface iron, is advanced: amosite> crocidolite≈chrysotile > anthophyllite > tremolite. Erionite, with a fairly high toxicity potential, contains only octahedrally coordinated Fe 3 +. Although it needs further experimental evidence, such available surface iron may be present as oxide nanoparticles coating and can be a direct cause of generation of hydroxyl radicals when such coating dissolves...|$|E
40|$|To examine spatial {{electron}} cyclotron damping in {{a uniform}} Vlasov plasma, {{it is noted that}} the plasma response to a steady-state transverse excitation consists of several terms (dielectric-pole, free-streaming, and branch-cut), but that the cyclotron-damped pole term is the dominant term for z l = c/w sub ce provided (w sub pe/w sub ce) squared (c/a) is much greater than 1. If the latter inequality does not hold, then the free-streaming and branch-cut terms persist well past z = c/w sub ce as w sub 1 approaches w sub ce, making experimental measurement of cyclotron damping essentially impossible. Considering only (w sub pe/w sub ce) squared (c/a) is much greater than 1, it is shown how collisional effects should be estimated and how a finite-width excitation usually has little effect on the cyclotron-damped part of the response. Criteria is established concerning collisional damping, measurable damping length sizes, and <b>allowed</b> <b>uncertainty</b> in the magnetic field Beta. Results of numerical calculations, showing the regions in the appropriate parameter spaces that meet these criteria, are presented.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the project "Validation of PESTLA" the Schaijk data set was used to analyse PESTLA model performance. The Schaijk data set contains field data on bentazon behaviour in a coarse textured humic gley soil cropped with maize. PESTLA model input parameters were derived from this data set and model simulations were performed. Comparison of model predictions with field measurements of bentazon concentrations in groundwater and contents in topsoil was done using graphical and statistical methods. The statistical method that was applied was the factor-of-f approach. This method acknowledges that both measurements and model simulations yield variable output. Variability implies that measurements and simulations are uncertain. This uncertainty is quantified and used to test the hypothesis that PESTLA model calculations are, or are not, sufficiently close to measurements. Application of the factor-of-f approach led to the conclusion that PESTLA simulated bentazon behaviour in Schaijk well. The hypothesis 'model is good' was never rejected and the hypothesis 'model is false' was rejected for almost all combinations of <b>allowed</b> <b>uncertainty.</b> The results given above were obtained with a value for bentazon half life as calculated using the standard method of linear regression on log transformed dissipation data. However, calculation of bentazon half life using non-linear regression yielded a value that was almost twice as small. PESTLA simulations using this latter value were nog in accordance with measurements anymore. This finding indicates that decisions with regard to model validity are highly sensitive to (subjective) decisions on how model input parameters are obtained. ...|$|E
40|$|State and {{transition}} models provide {{a simple and}} versatile way of describing vegetation dynamics in rangelands. However, state {{and transition}} models are traditionally descriptive, which has limited their practical application to rangeland management decision support. This paper demonstrates an approach to rangeland management decision support that combines a state and transition model with a Bayesian belief network to provide a relatively simple and updatable rangeland dynamics model that can accommodate uncertainty and be used for scenario, diagnostic, and sensitivity analysis. A state and transition model, developed by the authors for subtropical grassland in south-east Queensland, Australia, is used as an example. From the state and transition model, an influence diagram was built to show the possible transitions among states and the factors influencing each transition. The influence diagram was populated with probabilities to produce a predictive model {{in the form of}} a Bayesian belief network. The behaviour of the model was tested using scenario and sensitivity analysis, revealing that selective grazing, grazing pressure, and soil nutrition were believed to influence most transitions, while fire frequency and the frequency of good wet seasons were also important in some transitions. Overall, the integration of a state and transition model with a Bayesian belief network provided a useful way to utilise the knowledge embedded in a state and transition model for predictive purposes. Using a Bayesian belief network in the modelling approach <b>allowed</b> <b>uncertainty</b> and variability to be explicitly accommodated in the modelling process, and expert knowledge to be utilised in model development. The methods used also supported learning from monitoring data, thereby supporting adaptive rangeland management.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a contribution to}} programming by human demonstration [3], [14], {{in the context of}} compliant motion [4] tasks in which an object held by a manipulator moves in contact with an environmental object, as shown in Fig. 1. Major challenges in the automatic translation from a human compliant motion demonstration into an executable compliant motion robot program are: (i) to recognize the contact formation (CF) to which the human demonstration is currently subjected, (ii) to estimate the geometric parameters of that contact formation, and (iii) to detect when exactly the human demonstration execution changes between two CFs. Initial research on the identification of CFs focused mainly on two different approaches: (i) ad hoc identification strategies that exploit geometric knowledge of the contacting objects, but that have a very poor stochastic foundation (e. g. [1], [7]) and (ii) Hidden Markov Model based (hence stochastic) solutions to assembly problems that can recognize CF transitions very fast but only with limited <b>allowed</b> <b>uncertainty</b> (e. g.

40|$|Argonne National Laboratory is {{currently}} {{developing a new}} reactor control system for the McClellan Nuclear Radiation Facility. This new control system not only provides the same functionality as the existing control system in terms of graphic displays of reactor process variables, data archival capability, and manual, automatic, pulse and square-wave modes of operation, but adds to the functionality of the previous control system by incorporating signal processing algorithms for the validation of sensors and automatic calibration and verification of control rod worth curves. With the inclusion of these automated features, {{the intent of this}} control system is not to replace the operator but to make the process of controlling the reactor easier and safer for the operator. For instance, an automatic control rod calibration method reduces the amount of time to calibrate control rods from days to minutes, increasing overall reactor utilization. The control rod calibration curve, determined using the automatic calibration system, can be validated anytime after the calibration, as long as the reactor power is between 50 W and 500 W. This is done by banking all of the rods simultaneously and comparing the tabulated rod worth curves with a reactivity computer estimate. As long as the deviation between the tabulated values and the reactivity estimate is within a prescribed error band, then the system is in calibration. In order to minimize the amount of information displayed, only the essential flux-related data are displayed in graphical format on the control screen. Information from the sensor validation methods is communicated to the operators via messages, which appear in a message window. The messages inform the operators that the actual process variables do not correlate within the <b>allowed</b> <b>uncertainty</b> in the reactor system. These warnings, however, cannot cause the reactor to shutdown automatically. The reactor operator has the ultimate responsibility of using this information to either keep the reactor operating or to shut the reactor down. In addition to new developments in the signal processing realm, the new control system will be migrating from a PC-based computer platform to a Sun Solaris-based computer platform. The proven history of stability and performance of the Sun Sohuis operating system are the main advantages to this change. The I/O system will also be migrating from a PC-based data collection system, which communicates plant data to the control computer using RS- 232 connections, to an Ethernet-based I/O system. The Ethernet Data Acquisition System (EDAS) modules from Intelligent Instrumentation, Inc. provide an excellent solution for embedded control of a system using the more universally-accepted data transmission standard of TCP/IP. The modules contain a PROM, which operates all of the functionality of the I/O module, including the TCP/IP network access. Thus the module does not have an internal, sophisticated operating system to provide functionality but rather a small set hard-coded of instructions, which almost eliminates the possibility of the module failing due to software problems. An internal EEPROM can be modified over the Internet to change module configurations. Once configured, the module is contacted just like any other Internet host using TCP/IP socket calls. The main advantage to this architecture is its flexibility, expandability, and high throughput...|$|E
