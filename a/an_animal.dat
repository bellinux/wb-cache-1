5|$|A {{nest box}} {{can also be}} {{regarded}} as <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> surveillance device. Surveilling animals {{can lead to the}} discovery of new scientific and industrial fields. For example, biologists and engineers can work on barn owl surveillance techniques and devices, while social scientists document the practices that cause humans to observe <b>an</b> <b>animal.</b> While the diet of the barn owl has been studied, other areas like breeding success are not well known. Nest boxes provide direct physical access to the breeding location.|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>animal</b> epithet {{is a name}} used {{to label}} a person or group, by {{association}} with some perceived quality of <b>an</b> <b>animal.</b> Epithets may be formulated as similes, explicitly comparing people with the named animal, or as metaphors, directly naming people as animals. Animal epithets may be pejorative, readily giving offence, and they are sometimes used in political campaigns. One English epithet, lamb, is always used positively.|$|E

50|$|Foraging {{is searching}} for wild food resources. It affects <b>an</b> <b>animal's</b> fitness because it plays an {{important}} role in <b>an</b> <b>animal's</b> ability to survive and reproduce.

5|$|Animal {{coloration}} is {{the general}} appearance of <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> resulting from the reflection or emission of light from its surfaces. Some animals are brightly coloured, while others are hard to see. In some species, such as the peafowl, the male has strong patterns, conspicuous colours and is iridescent, while the female is far less visible.|$|E
5|$|Another pursuit-deterrent {{signal is}} {{thanatosis}} or playing dead. Thanatosis {{is a form}} of bluff in which <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> mimics its own dead body, feigning death to avoid being attacked by predators seeking live prey. Thanatosis can also be used by the predator in order to lure prey into approaching.|$|E
5|$|Delayed {{gratification}} or deferred gratification is <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> {{behavior that}} {{can be linked to}} delay discounting, ecological factors, individual fitness, and neurobiological mechanisms.

5|$|Disruptive {{patterns}} use strongly contrasting, non-repeating markings such as spots or stripes {{to break}} up the outlines of <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> or military vehicle, or to conceal telltale features, especially the eyes, as in the common frog. Disruptive patterns may use more than one method to defeat visual systems such as edge detection. Predators like the leopard use disruptive camouflage to help them approach prey, while potential prey like the Egyptian nightjar use it to avoid detection by predators. Disruptive patterning is common in military usage, both for uniforms and for military vehicles. Disruptive patterning, however, does not always achieve crypsis on its own, as <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> or a military target may be given away by factors like shape, shine, and shadow.|$|E
5|$|Finally, it {{is quite}} {{possible}} that the sail or hump combined these functions, acting normally as a heat regulator, becoming a courting aid during the mating season, being used to cool itself and, on occasions, turning into an intimidating device when <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> was feeling threatened.|$|E

Ed Meecham, <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> handler at the zoo, recounts how he came to the elephant's locked cage to find it empty. His boss, Willa Ambrose, tells the agents that the zoo is in danger of closing due to other animal disappearances. She blames the zoo's decline on <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> rights group which is known to free captive animals. The group's leader, Kyle Lang, denies any involvement in the elephant's release. Lang tells them that Ambrose is being sued by the Malawi government over a lowland gorilla she took from their country ten years prior.|$|E

5|$|Koalas were {{hunted for}} food by Aboriginals. A common {{technique}} used {{to capture the}} animals was to attach a loop of ropey bark {{to the end of}} a long, thin pole, so as to form a noose. This would be used to snare <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> high in a tree, beyond the reach of a climbing hunter; <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> brought down this way would then be killed with a stone hand axe or hunting stick (waddy). According to the customs of some tribes, it was considered taboo to skin the animal, while other tribes thought the animal's head had a special status, and saved them for burial.|$|E
5|$|Like Vishnu's {{first two}} avatars - Matsya (fish) and Kurma (turtle), the third avatar Varaha is {{depicted}} either in zoomorphic form as <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> (a wild boar), or anthropomorphically. The main {{difference in the}} anthropomorphic form portrayal {{is that the first}} two avatars are depicted with a torso of a man and the bottom half as animal, while Varaha has <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> (boar) head and a human body. The portrayal of the anthropomorphic Varaha is similar to the fourth avatar Narasimha (portrayed as a lion-headed man), who is the first avatar of Vishnu that is not completely animal.|$|E
