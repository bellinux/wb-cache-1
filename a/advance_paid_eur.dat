5000|$|For most cases, the {{publishers}} advance an amount (part of the royalty) which can constitute {{the bulk of}} the author's total income plus whatever little flows from the [...] "running royalty" [...] stream.

The author and the publisher can independently draw up the agreement that binds them or alongside an agent representing the author.

60|$|But {{what most}} {{astonished}} me, and seemed most incredible, was the infernal opinion of Jackson, {{that the man}} had been actually dead when brought on board the ship; and that knowingly, and merely {{for the sake of the}} month's <b>advance,</b> <b>paid</b> into his hand upon the strength of the bill he presented, the body-snatching crimp had knowingly shipped a corpse on board of the Highlander, under the pretense of its being a live body in a drunken trance. And I heard Jackson say, that he had known of such things having been done before. But that a really dead body ever burned in that manner, I can not even yet believe. But the sailors seemed familiar with such things; or at least with the stories of such things having happened to others.|$|R

50|$|Dick {{began the}} book but {{realized}} {{he did not}} know enough about Christianity to finish it. He asked Ted White to collaborate on it with him, but after reviewing the manuscript White never got started. Zelazny discovered the manuscript in White's home in early 1968, read it, then contacted Dick and agreed to work on it with him. Work proceeded sporadically over several years as each author forgot about it in turn (and Zelazny's cat took the opportunity to urinate on the original manuscript). But they finished it quickly in the spring of 1975 when the publisher demanded the manuscript or repayment of the <b>advance</b> <b>paid</b> to Dick. The editor discovered Zelazny had sent photocopies of some pages and demanded the originals as per Doubleday's policy; much to Zelazny's chagrin, he had to send in the urine-stained pages and he always wondered what the editor made of them.|$|R
