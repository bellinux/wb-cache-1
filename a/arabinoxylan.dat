40|$|<b>Arabinoxylans</b> are {{the major}} non-starch polysaccharides in wheat and are {{reported}} to influence quality of bakery products. <b>Arabinoxylans</b> were isolated from good and poor chapati making varieties, added them at different levels (0. 25 and 0. 5 g/ 100 g) to the same flour, interchanged with other varieties and determined the effect of <b>arabinoxylans</b> on rheological properties of dough and chapati making quality. Rheological properties were improved upon adding isolated <b>arabinoxylans</b> of good chapati making varieties to flours. Interestingly, addition of isolated <b>arabinoxylans</b> of good chapati making varieties to poor chapati making varieties had significantly improved the chapati quality. Sensory studies showed that chapatis prepared from flour added with <b>arabinoxylans</b> of good chapati varieties had soft texture and high overall quality scores. These changes are attributed to differences in their arabinose/xylose ratio.

40|$|The {{content of}} beta-glucans and <b>arabinoxylans</b> in barley grain, malt and wort was monitored. The {{varieties}} of barley were Pionier, Libuše, Manta, Tango, KWS Amadora, Kampa, KWS Irina, Francin, Odyssey, Overture, Vendela, Petrus, Laudis 550, Sunshine, Kangoo, Xanadu, Sebastian, Bojos and Malz. These varieties were grown on three different habitats (Uherský Ostroh, Věrovany and Vysoká u Příbramě). The content of beta-glucans and <b>arabinoxylans</b> was also analysed in five {{different types of}} beer. In brewing and malting industry the content of beta-glucans and <b>arabinoxylans</b> is mainly monitored because of their negative influence on decanting of wort and filtration of beer. These substances can contribute to turbidity and precipitation in beer and thus negatively effect the stability of beer. The content of beta-glucans in barley grain, malt, wort and beer was determined by FIA method {{and the content of}} <b>arabinoxylans</b> was determined in barley grain, wort and beer by Douglas method. The highest content of beta-glucans in barley grain was found in 14 / 19 varieties at Uherský Ostroh, where the amount of beta-glucan content was in the range of 3, 65 - 5, 60 %. The highest beta-glucan content in malt was found in 17 / 19 varieties at Vysoká u Příbramě, where the beta-glucan content was between 0, 15 - 0, 79 % and the highest content of beta-glucans in wort was found in 16 / 19 varieties also at Vysoká u Příbramě.
