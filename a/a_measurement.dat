40|$|The {{possibility}} of using D(sub A), the mean depression of a quasar spectrum due to Ly-alpha forest absorption, {{to study the}} number density evolution of the Ly-alpha forest clouds is examined in some detail. Current D(sub <b>A)</b> <b>measurements</b> are made against a continuum that is a power-law extrapolation from the continuum longward of Ly-alpha emission. Compared to the line-counting approach, the D(sub A) -method has the advantage that the D(sub <b>A)</b> <b>measurements</b> are not affected by line-blending effects. However, we find using low-redshift quasar spectra obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), where the true continuum in the Ly-alpha forest can be estimated fairly reliably because of the much lower density of the Ly-alpha forest lines, that the extrapolated continuum often deviates systematically from the true continuum in the forest region. Such systematic continuum errors introduce large errors in the D(sub <b>A)</b> <b>measurements.</b> The current D(sub <b>A)</b> <b>measurements</b> may also be significantly biased by the possible presence of the Gunn-Peterson absorption. We propose a modification to the existing D(sub A) -method, namely, to measure D(sub A) against a locally established continuum in the Ly-alpha forest. Under conditions that the quasar spectrum has good resolution and S/N {{to allow for a}} reliable estimate of the local continuum in the Ly-alpha forest, the modified D(sub <b>A)</b> <b>measurements</b> should be largely free of the systematic uncertainties suffered by the existing D(sub <b>A)</b> <b>measurements.</b> We also introduce a formalism {{based on the work of}} Zuo (1993) to simplify the application of the D(sub A) -method(s) to real data. We discuss the merits and limitations of the modified D(sub A) -method, and conclude that it is a useful alternative. Our findings that the extrapolated continuum from longward of Ly-alpha emission often deviates systematically from the true continuum in the Ly-alpha forest present a major problem in the study of the Gunn-Peterson absorption...|$|R

M-71 runs parallel to, and in between, the river and a branch line of the Huron and Eastern Railway. Corunna Avenue continues this way through the community of Middletown and into Corunna. M-71 turns south through downtown Corunna on Shiawassee Street to McNeil Street.

5|$|The {{balance between}} the {{oxidized}} and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is called the NAD/NADH ratio. This ratio {{is an important component}} of what is called the redox state of a cell, <b>a</b> <b>measurement</b> that reflects both the metabolic activities and the health of cells. The effects of the NAD/NADH ratio are complex, controlling the activity of several key enzymes, including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase. In healthy mammalian tissues, estimates of the ratio between free NAD and NADH in the cytoplasm typically lie around 700; the ratio is thus favourable for oxidative reactions. The ratio of total NAD/NADH is much lower, with estimates ranging from 3–10 in mammals. In contrast, the NADP/NADPH ratio is normally about 0.005, so NADPH is the dominant form of this coenzyme. These different ratios are key to the different metabolic roles of NADH and NADPH.|$|E
