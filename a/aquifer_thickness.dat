40|$|High-temperature aquifer {{thermal energy}} storage (HT-ATES) is an {{important}} technique for energy conservation. A controlling factor for the economic feasibility of HT-ATES is the recovery efficiency. Due {{to the effects of}} density-driven flow (free convection), HTATES systems applied in permeable aquifers typically have lower recovery efficiencies than conventional (lowtemperature) ATES systems. For a reliable estimation of the recovery efficiency it is, therefore, important to take the effect of density-driven flow into account. A numerical evaluation of the prime factors influencing the recovery efficiency of HT-ATES systems is presented. Sensitivity runs evaluating the effects of aquifer properties, as well as operational variables, were performed to deduce the most important factors that control the recovery efficiency. A correlation was found between the dimensionless Rayleigh number (a measure of the relative strength of free convection) and the calculated recovery efficiencies.
