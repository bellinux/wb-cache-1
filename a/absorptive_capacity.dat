In fact, whether the firm is {{able to take advantage of}} inbound open innovation depends largely on <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity.</b> According to Cohen and Levinthal, the concept of <b>absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> is critical to the innovativeness of a firm.

Secondly the ability to assimilate them and, finally, the ability to apply them to commercial ends. In short: <b>Absorptive</b> <b>capacity</b> is the ability to appropriate external knowledge.
