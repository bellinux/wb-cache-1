Given an input set of multi-dimensional data points, where each data point {{is assumed to}} be multi-dimensional, and an <b>additional</b> <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> point for similarity finding, the algorithm uses kernel method that embeds the data points into a low dimensional manifold. Unlike other kernel methods, which consider the entire data for the embedding, our method selects a specific set of kernel eigenvectors. The eigenvectors are chosen to separate between the data points and the reference data point so that similar data points can be easily identified as being distinct from most of the members in the dataset.

40|$|Current {{parallel}} {{imaging techniques}} for accelerated imaging require a fully encoded reference data set {{to estimate the}} spa-tial coil sensitivity information needed for reconstruction. In dynamic parallel imaging a time-interleaved acquisition scheme can be used, which {{eliminates the need for}} separately acquiring <b>additional</b> <b>reference</b> <b>data,</b> since the signal from directly adja-cent time frames can be merged to build a set of fully encoded full-resolution reference data for coil calibration. In this work, we demonstrate that a time-interleaved sampling scheme, in combination with autocalibrated GRAPPA (referred to as TGRAPPA), allows one to easily update the coil weights for the GRAPPA algorithm dynamically, thereby improving the acquisi-tion efficiency. This method may update coil sensitivity esti-mates frame by frame, thereby tracking changes in relative coil sensitivities that may occur during the data acquisition. Mag...|$|E

40|$|Galaxy surveys {{provide a}} {{large-scale}} {{view of the}} universe that typically has a limited line-of-sight or redshift resolution. The lack of radial accuracy in these surveys can be modelled by picturing the universe as a set of concentric radial shells of finite width around the observer, i. e, an onion-like structure. We present a new N-body simulation with 2048 ^ 3 particles developed at the Marenostrum supercomputer with the GADGET- 2 code. Using the lightcone output we build a set of angular maps that mimic this onion-like representation of the universe. The onion maps are a highly compressed version of the raw data (i. e. a factor > 1000 smaller size for arcminute resolution maps) and they provide a new and powerful tool to exploit large scale structure observations. We introduce two basic applications of these maps that are especially useful for constraning dark energy properties: the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the galaxy power spectrum and all-sky maps of the weak lensing distortion. Using the weak lensing maps, we measure the convergence power spectra and compare it to halo fit predictions. As a further application, we compute the variance and higher-order moments of the maps. We show that sampling variance on scales of few degrees is quite large, resulting in a significant (25 % at 10 arminute scales) bias in the variance. We caution that current lensing surveys such as the COSMOS HST should take into account this bias and extra sampling error in their clustering analyses and inferred cosmological parameter constraints. Finally, we test the importance of projection effects in the weak lensing mass reconstruction. On the mean, the mass calibration works well but it exhibits a large non-Gaussian scatter what could induce a large bias in the recovered mass function. Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS.

40|$|Objective: To review {{research}} articles in psychiatry and psychology involving Latin American populations and/or produced by Latin American scholars {{to investigate the}} differential diagnosis between spiritual/anomalous experiences and mental disorders in order {{to contribute to the}} validity of the International Classification of Diseases towards its 11 (th) edition in this area. Method: We searched electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and SciELO) using relevant keywords (possession, trance, religious experience, spiritual experience, latin*, Brazil) for articles with original psychiatric and psychological data on spiritual experiences. We also analyzed the references of the articles found and contacted authors for <b>additional</b> <b>references</b> and <b>data.</b> Results: There is strong evidence that psychotic and anomalous experiences are frequent in the general population and that most of them are not related to psychotic disorders. Often, spiritual experiences involve non-pathological dissociative and psychotic experiences. Although spiritual experiences are not usually related to mental disorders, they may cause transient distress and are commonly reported by psychotic patients. Conclusion: We propose some features that suggest the non-pathological nature of a spiritual experience: lack of suffering, lack of social or functional impairment, compatibility with the patient's cultural background and recognition by others, absence of psychiatric comorbidities, control over the experience, and personal growth over time...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to improve liver tumour {{characterization}} using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, where the liver is imaged rapidly following the injection of a paramagnetic contrast agent. Such dynamic studies can provide useful information about hepatic blood flow. However, they remain a practical challenge due to the competing requirements of spatial and temporal resolution needed to characterize briefly-enhancing arterial structures while retaining adequate coverage. Dynamic data can be acquired rapidly using reduced central k-space sampling, where spatial resolution is sacrificed for speed during {{some parts of the}} acquisition and high-resolution reference scans are acquired separately. Several constrained reconstruction algorithms that incorporate this <b>additional</b> <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> were evaluated, focussing on variants of Data Replacement Technique (DRT) and Generalized Series (GS) reconstruction. Novel methods using adaptive filtering and mixed enhancement models, potentially appropriate for liver imaging, were also developed. Reconstructions of various types of enhancement were evaluated using numerical simulations and twelve dynamic liver studies acquired from three patients with colorectal liver metastases. Quantitative comparisons are presented. The liver moves both within and between breath-holds. Experimental data was used to assess these variations, and a simple, robust, fast method of motion correction based on tracking the location of the diaphragm was implemented and tested. This approach was then incorporated into constrained reconstruction. A novel methodology for mapping the Hepatic Perfusion Index from dynamic MR data was implemented. It was applied to twenty-five further dynamic liver studies, acquired from patients with liver metastases and controls with normal liver function.

40|$|The aim {{of these}} studies was to provide {{reference}} data on intersubject variability and reproducibility of diffusion tensor imaging. Healthy volunteers underwent imaging on two occasions using the same 3 T Siemens Verio magnetic resonance scanner. At each session two identical diffusion tensor sequences were obtained along with standard structural imaging. Fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient, axial and radial diffusivity maps were created and regions of interest applied in normalised space. The baseline data from all 26 volunteers were {{used to calculate the}} intersubject variability, while within session and between session reproducibility were calculated from all the available data. The reproducibility of measurements were used to calculate the overall and within session 95 % prediction interval for zero change. The within and between session reproducibility data were lower than the values for intersubject variability, and were different across the brain. The regional mean (range) coefficient of variation figures for within session reproducibility were 2. 1 (0. 9 – 5. 5 %), 1. 2 (0. 4 – 3. 9 %), 1. 2 (0. 4 – 3. 8 %) and 1. 8 (0. 4 – 4. 3 %) for fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient, axial and radial diffusivity, and were lower than between session reproducibility measurements (2. 4 (1. 1 – 5. 9 %), 1. 9 (0. 7 – 5. 7 %), 1. 7 (0. 7 – 4. 7 %) and 2. 4 (0. 9 – 5. 8 %); p, 0. 001).

40|$|Three {{drafts of}} Bos indicus cross steers (initially 178 - 216 kg) grazed Leucaena-grass pasture [Leucaena leucocephala {{subspecies}} glabrata cv. Cunningham with green panic (Panicum maximum cv. trichoglume) ] from late winter through to autumn during three consecutive {{years in the}} Burnett region of south-east Queensland. Measured daily weight gain (DWGActual) of the steers was generally 0. 7 - 1. 1 kg/day during the summer months. Estimated intakes of metabolisable energy and dry matter (DM) were calculated from feeding standards as the intakes required by the steers to grow at the DWGActual. Diet attributes were predicted from near infrared reflectance spectroscopy spectra of faeces (F. NIRS) using established calibration equations appropriate for northern Australian forages. Inclusion of some additional reference samples from cattle consuming Leucaena diets into F. NIRS calibrations based on grass and herbaceous legume-grass pastures improved prediction of the proportion of Leucaena in the diet. Mahalanobis distance values supported {{the hypothesis that the}} F. NIRS predictions of diet crude protein concentration and DM digestibility (DMD) were acceptable. F. NIRS indicated that the percentage of Leucaena in the diet varied widely (10 - 99 %). Diet crude protein concentration and DMD were usually high, averaging 12. 4 and 62 %, respectively, and were related asymptotically to the percentage of Leucaena in the diet (R 2 = 0. 48 and 0. 33, respectively). F. NIRS calibrations for DWG were not satisfactory to predict this variable from an individual faecal sample since the s. e. of prediction were 0. 33 - 0. 40 kg/day. Cumulative steer liveweight (LW) predicted from F. NIRS DWG calibrations, which had been previously developed with tropical grass and grass-herbaceous legume pastures, greatly overestimated the measured steer LW; therefore, these calibrations were not useful. Cumulative steer LW predicted from a modified F. NIRS DWG calibration, which included data from the present study, was strongly correlated (R 2 = 0. 95) with steer LW but overestimated LW by 19 - 31 kg after 8 months. <b>Additional</b> <b>reference</b> <b>data</b> are needed to develop robust F.

40|$|Significant {{scientific}} {{work has been}} dedicated for exploration of the infrared applications within wood science and technology, not much has been done linking it to the mechanical testing. It is expected that due to mechanical stresses (and related deformations) the interaction between constitutive elements of wood changes, proportionally to the stresses applied. The response of the material to mechanical stresses (such as tensile loading) on the molecular level should be therefore detectable by means of infrared spectroscopy. Dedicated tests have been devoted for proving this hypothesis. Self developed testing machine has been integrated with infrared spectrometer in order to conduct a series fully controlled mechanical tests. It was possible to predict stress level of wood during tension by applying proper chemometric analysis (partial least square (PLS) models). Implementation of infrared spectroscopy in to timber engineering and mechanical testing of wood provides very essential supplement to the typical information collected during standard tests.
