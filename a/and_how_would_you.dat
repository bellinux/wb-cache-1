60|$|Thursday morning. After a {{tremendous}} night of crowding, shouting, drinking-house expectoration, Gong-donkey, and correct cards. Symptoms of yesterday's {{gains in the}} way of drink, and of yesterday's losses {{in the way of}} money, abundant. Money-losses very great. As usual, nobody seems to have won; but, large losses and many losers are unquestionable facts. Both Lunatics and Keepers, in general very low. Several of both kinds look in at the chemist's while Mr. Goodchild is making a purchase there, to be 'picked up.' One red-eyed Lunatic, flushed, faded, and disordered, enters hurriedly and cries savagely, 'Hond us a gloss of sal volatile in wather, or soom dommed thing o' thot sart!' Faces at the Betting Rooms very long, and a tendency to bite nails observable. Keepers likewise given this morning to standing about solitary, with their hands in their pockets, looking down at their boots as they fit them into cracks of the pavement, and then looking up whistling and walking away. Grand Alliance Circus out, in procession; buxom lady-member of Grand Alliance, in crimson riding-habit, fresher to look at, even in her paint under the day sky, than the cheeks of Lunatics or Keepers. Spanish Cavalier appears to have lost yesterday, and jingles his bossed bridle with disgust, as if he were paying. Reaction also apparent at the Guildhall opposite, whence certain pickpockets come out handcuffed together, with that peculiar walk which is never seen under any other circumstances--a walk expressive of going to jail, game, but still of jails being in bad taste and arbitrary, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>YOU</b> like it if it was you instead of me, as it ought to be! Mid-day. Town filled as yesterday, but not so full; and emptied as yesterday, but not so empty. In the evening, Angel ordinary where every Lunatic and Keeper has his modest daily meal of turtle, venison, and wine, not so crowded as yesterday, and not so noisy. At night, the theatre. More abstracted faces in it than one ever sees at public assemblies; such faces wearing an expression which strongly reminds Mr. Goodchild of the boys at school who were 'going up next,' with their arithmetic or mathematics. These boys are, no doubt, going up to-morrow with THEIR sums and figures. Mr. Palmer and Mr. Thurtell in the boxes O. P. Mr. Thurtell and Mr. Palmer in the boxes P. S. The firm of Thurtell, Palmer, and Thurtell, in the boxes Centre. A most odious tendency observable in these distinguished gentlemen to put vile constructions on sufficiently innocent phrases in the play, and then to applaud them in a Satyr-like manner. Behind Mr. Goodchild, with a party of other Lunatics and one Keeper, the express incarnation of the thing called a 'gent.' A gentleman born; a gent manufactured. A something with a scarf round its neck, and a slipshod speech issuing from behind the scarf; more depraved, more foolish, more ignorant, more unable to believe in any noble or good thing of any kind, than the stupidest Bosjesman. The thing is but a boy in years, and is addled with drink. To do its company justice, even its company is ashamed of it, as it drawls its slang criticisms on the representation, and inflames Mr. Goodchild with a burning ardour to fling it into the pit. Its remarks are so horrible, that Mr. Goodchild, for the moment, even doubts whether that IS a wholesome Art, which sets women apart on a high floor before such a thing as this, though as good as its own sisters, or its own mother--whom Heaven forgive for bringing it into the world! But, the consideration that a low nature must make a low world of its own to live in, whatever the real materials, or it could no more exist than any of us could without the sense of touch, brings Mr. Goodchild to reason: the rather, because the thing soon drops its downy chin upon its scarf, and slobbers itself asleep.|$|E

5000|$|In America in {{the middle}} of the twentieth century, {{alcoholism}} was more often considered a character flaw and shameful secret rather than a disease (the American Medical Association declared alcoholism to be a disease only in 1956, for instance).

50|$|Estimating the {{economic}} impact of food & beverage tourism is at best, very difficult. First, we would need to find how many travelers there are to an area. Then we would need to interview them to find out how much they spend on food and drink while traveling. We could dig deeper and ask them what percentage of their expenditures are for sustenance vs. a unique food or beverage experience. We would also have to factor out expenditures by locals. <b>And</b> <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> account for a visitor's spending on gourmet souvenir items in a grocery store? As you can see, the task is very difficult, and the cost of figuring out exactly how much travelers are spending on food and beverage experiences can outweigh the findings. The World Food Travel Association (WFTA) provides a formula. Over the years, through the WFTA's own research, secondary research, interviews and conversations, the association has constructed its own impression of the value of food tourism. By itsestimate, visitors spend approximately 25% of their travel budget on food and beverages. The figure can get as high as 35% in expensive destinations, and as low as 15% on more affordable destinations.  Confirmed food lovers also spend a bit more than the average of 25% spent by travelers in general. The association recommends that interested parties conduct more evidence-based research if you require absolute precision. The WFTA is confident that your results will most likely fall in this range. Most governments publish data on total visitor arrivals and expenditures. Take the estimated economic impact of visitors to your area and multiply it by 25%. That is your estimated economic impact of expenditures on the food and beverage sector.|$|E

Computed tomography performed to visualise the kidneys unexpectedly revealed an abnormal aspect of the lateral wall of the left ventricle (LV) (figure 1). He was subsequently referred to our cardiology department. He had suffered from an inferior wall myocardial infarction 21 years earlier. Coronary artery bypass grafting was performed six years later using two venous grafts and the left internal mammary artery. Afterwards the patient was in an excellent clinical condition.

In this article I examine the restaurant menu as a world-making social and translocutional/transinscriptional technology (the menu as menu-logic and cosmo-menu). As a kind of text act that is situated at but one of many “iterative/inscriptional stations ” along an indeterminate and continuous chain of translocutions and transinscriptions, the menu highlights the temporal dimension of all kinds of translations (translingual, intralingual, transmodal, transcultural, etc.) ...|$|E

From October to April {{the ground is}} covered in snow-a bit further in from the coast the land is covered in ice all year. In 1721 the primary food was seal, whose skins, intestines, and fur served multiple purposes. Reindeer and walrus, as well as different kinds of birds, whales, and fish were also main ingredients in the diet.

40|$|A 49 -year-old, human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) - infected, Haitian-born woman presented with a left facial mass that she had noticed for the previous eight weeks. She was {{known to have been}} HIV-seropositive for the previous 11 years and had been on multiple antiretroviral therapies. Her past medical history was also significant for hypertension, disseminated varicella zoster virus and recurrent oral and buttock Herpes simplex episodes. She was taking the following medications {{at the time of her}} presentation with the facial mass: stavudine, lamivudine, didanosine, nelfinavir mesylate, famciclovir, hydrochlorothiazide and cotrimoxazole. She had no complaints of fever, chills, sweats, weight loss or anorexia. She denied any pain, redness or warmth at the site of the facial swelling. Her most recent CD 4 lymphocyte count was 336 cells/µL, with an HIV viral load of log 102. 6 copies/mL. Physical examination revealed a 4 cm fluid-filled mass in the left parotid gland. There was no detectable induration, redness, warmth or tenderness, and no associated adenopathy. The rest of the examination was unremarkable. An aspirate of the mass was performed under sterile conditions and yielded 30 mL of turbid, yellow liquid. A Gram stain revealed no neutrophils, scant mononuclear cells and no visible organisms. An acid-fast stain was negative as well. Routine, mycobacterial and fungal cultures showed no growth. Cytological analysis showed scant reactive lymphocytes and no malignant cells. The patient was not given therapy and was observed for another two months. The fluid reaccumulated in the left parotid gland, and the patient?s only complaint concerned the unsightly appearance of the mass. The lesion was again aspirated for 30 mL of fluid and this time, the fluid had a turbid, brown appearance. All laboratory results were identical to the results from the first aspirate.

40|$|Carl Schurz 2 ̆ 7 s {{importance}} as an immigrant leader and ethnic politician is well documented; his efforts {{on behalf of}} civil service reform and anti-imperialism have often been commented upon. His role as an administrator, however, is less familiar but by no means insignificant. Because it contributed to the more rational treatment of native Americans and the conservation of natural resources, it deserves to be explored more fully. In March 1877, when President Rutherford B. Hayes sent to the Senate his nomination of Carl Schurz for secretary of the interior, party regulars were outraged. 2 ̆ 2 In the selection of Mr. Schurz as one of your Cabinet, you will offend, of course, President Grant and his warm friends, as Mr. S. was a bitter enemy of Grant, and did his best to make him odious {{in the minds of the}} people, 2 ̆ 2 one Republican wrote to the president. 2 ̆ 2 Change places with President Grant, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> feel should he take a bitter opponent of yours into his Cabinet? 2 ̆ 2 Schurz was accused of being an unrealistic dreamer, an impractical philosopher with no ability in business. Roscoe Conkling and his allies hated him; James G. Blaine distrusted him and John A. Logan was jealous of him. His desertion of the Republican party in 1872 had never been forgotten, and when even the moderate James A. Garfield thought the appointment unfortunate, there was some question whether the Senate would confirm it. In the end, however, Hayes prevailed, and the controversial appointee became Zachariah Chandler 2 ̆ 7 s successor in the Department of the Interior. CARL SCHURZ 2 ̆ 7 S CAREER It is not surprising that Schurz 2 ̆ 7 s elevation caused such a row. One of the most colorful figures in nineteenth-century America, the young German revolutionary from the Rhineland had become famous at the age of twentyone, when he liberated his professor, Gottfried Kinkel (then serving a life term for revolutionary activities), from a jail near Berlin. Schurz, who in 1849 had himself narrowly avoided Prussian capture by fleeing through a sewer from the besieged fortress of Rastatt, succeeded in bribing one of the professor 2 ̆ 7 s guards. After Kinkel was lowered to the street from the roof, his liberator took him to the coast and from there he escaped by ship to Britain...|$|E
