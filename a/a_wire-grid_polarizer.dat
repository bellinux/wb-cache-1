30|$|In sample B, {{threading}} dislocations {{entered the}} MQW layer, and no ISB absorption {{was presented in}} Figure 4. The absence of ISB absorption {{can be attributed to}} those reasons as shown below. First, the high density of threading edge dislocations exists in sample B. It was discovered that edge dislocations in III-nitride cause propagation loss for transverse-magnetic (TM) polarization of light in a waveguide[25]. Edge dislocations introduce acceptor centers along the dislocation lines, and electrons are captured by the acceptor centers[26]. Eventually, charges perpendicularly align and work like <b>a</b> <b>wire-grid</b> <b>polarizer.</b> This excess polarization-dependent loss is critical for ISB since ISB occurs only for TM polarization in a waveguide structure. Second, polarization charge in the GaN/AlGaN heterostructure will surely influence ISB intensity since ISB absorption strongly relies on the net carrier density in the QW. Compositionally graded AlGaN films grown on unintentionally doped GaN templates can achieve high electron-sheet concentrations which are results of polarization-induced doping[27 – 29]. According to the HRXRD analysis, order satellite peaks at − 1 were present in sample B. No higher-order peaks manifested the rough interface in the MQW layer. As is well known, the electron density is crucial to the infrared absorption property of the ISB devices because electron–hole pairs cannot be generated only in the conductive band. The rough interface of the sample with SL interlayer surely decreased polarization-induced net electron density in the quantum well. Besides, interface instability pushes the first excited electron state close to the barrier conduction band edge. As a consequence, the e 1 and e 2 oscillator strength is reduced, and the ISB absorption becomes weak or even vanishes[30].|$|E
40|$|Dramatic {{advances}} in millimeter and submillimeter wave receivers {{in recent years}} have resulted from the development of superconductor insulator superconductor (SIS) mixers, which now offer unsurpassed performance from 70 GHz to 1 THz. To increase the sensitivity of the receivers further at these frequencies, one needs to use dual-polarized and balanced receivers. When both the polarizations are received simultaneously, there is a square root of two improvement in the signal to noise ratio (SNR). Balanced mixers improve the sensitivity of receivers by suppressing local oscillator (LO) amplitude modulation (AM) noise and rejecting LO thermal noise. This thesis describes the design, fabrication and performance of mixers and components for low noise dual-polarized and balanced receivers at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths both in quasi-optical and waveguide configurations. The quasi-optical receiver utilizes a novel cross-slot antenna on a silicon hyperhemispherical lens, two junction tuning circuits, niobium trilayer junctions, and an IF circuit containing a lumped element 180 degree hybrid. The antenna has four feed points, two for each polarization; and each feed point is coupled to a two-junction SIS mixer. For dual polarization operation, the mixer is mounted {{in such a way that}} a single LO can pump the junctions for both the polarizations. For the balanced receiver, the LO and the RF signals are coupled to the mixer in orthogonal polarizations using <b>a</b> <b>wire-grid</b> <b>polarizer.</b> For waveguide dual polarization receivers, a moderately broadband septum ortho-mode transducer (OMT) is designed and experimental results are presented at millimeter wavelengths.

A reflecting-type circular polarizer is used at the LO input port to generate a 90 -degree phase-difference between two perpendicular components. Second approach is a dual polarization usage of the well-known Martin-Puplett Interferometer (MPI). We propose a pair of mixers be used in combination with a single MPI for receiving the upper sideband (USB) and lower sideband (LSB) at the same time. Another MPI is coupled to this configuration for LO injection and image termination to a cold load. The first approach is superior in realizing a broader RF bandwidth without necessity of mechanical tuning, while the second gives a higher coupling efficiency for LO injection. 33...|$|R

The simulation results showed extraordinary optical transmission through the device for perpendicular polarization, creating excellent transmittance and extinction ratios over the frequency range.

40|$|A quasi-optical {{transmission}} line (QOTL) {{has been developed}} as a low-loss {{transmission line}} for a spaceborne cloudobserving radar instrument that operates at a nominal frequency of 94 GHz. This QOTL could also readily be redesigned for use in terrestrial millimeter-wave radar systems and millimeter-wave imaging systems. In the absence of this or another lowloss transmission line, {{it would be necessary}} to use a waveguide transmission line in the original radar application. Unfortunately, transmission losses increase and power-handling capacities of waveguides generally decrease with frequency, such that at 94 GHz, the limitation on transmitting power and the combined transmission and reception losses (greater than 5 dB) in a waveguide transmission line previously considered for the original application would be unacceptable. The QOTL functions as a very-lowloss, three-port circulator. The QOTL includes a shaped input mirror that can be rotated to accept 94 -GHz transmitter power from either of two high-power amplifiers. Inside the QOTL, the transmitter power {{takes the form of a}} linearly polarized beam radiated from a feed horn. This beam propagates through a system of mirrors, each of which refocuses the beam to minimize diffraction losses. A magnetically biased ferrite disc is placed at one of the foci to utilize the Faraday effect to rotate the polarization of the beam by 45 degrees. The beam is then transmitted via an antenna system. The radar return (scatter from clouds, and/or reflections from other objects) is collected by the same antenna and propagates through the Faraday rotator in the reverse of the direction of propagation of the transmitted beam. In the Faraday rotator, the polarization of the received signal is rotated a further 45 degrees, so that upon emerging from the Faraday rotator, the received beam is polarized at 90 with respect to the transmitted beam.

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 In {{this thesis}} I studied several THz {{components}} {{that can be}} used for potential THz technology. THz waves were generated in nonlinear medium via optical rectification of femtosecond optical pulses. Utilizing the phase matching condition between the optical and THz waves in a ZnTe crystal, single-cycle broad-band THz pulses were obtained. On the other hand, a tunable narrow-band THz waves were generated in PPLN structures based on a quasi-phased matching process. THz waves were detected via free-space electro-optic detection. Several methods of THz pulse shaping were demonstrated. First, the generated THz waves replicated the polled lithium niobate (PLN) domain structures. In the 2 nd method, we controlled the THz pulse shape by adjusting the delay time between two coherent optical pulses impinging on a fanned out periodically poled lithium niobate (FO-PPLN) structure. The 3 rd method is an adaptive THz pulse shaping technique in which each frequency component of the THz wave generated in the FO-PPLN crystal was manipulated Controlling the ellipticity of the THz wave is highly desirable for many applications. Two linearly right-angled and delayed optical pulses incident on a nonlinear medium generated two coherent THz pulses. The ellipticity of the resultant THz wave was controlled by adjusting the delay time between the two optical pulses. The other and more efficient technique is to use the THz wave-plate consisting of <b>a</b> <b>wire-grid</b> <b>polarizer</b> and a mirror. The output of the waveplate is two linearly and perpendicularly polarized THz waves with a relative phase shift. The ellipticity of the output pulse is controlled by adjusting the distance between the wire-grid and the mirror located behind it. Linear THz properties of 1 D periodic dielectric structure were studied. Distributed-Brag-reflectors with 5, 10, and 15 periods in both transmission and reflection arrangements were investigated. Stop-bands at (0. 5 - 0. 7) THz and (1. 6 - 1. 8) THz were shown in the transmission arrangement.

40|$|A {{widely used}} {{polarizer}} in the IR is the <b>wire-grid</b> <b>polarizer.</b> <b>Wire-grid</b> <b>polarizers</b> with <b>a</b> typical minimal wire spacing of � 0. 25 mm perform {{well in the}} middle IR and the far IR, but in the near IR the performance deteriorates as the wavelength approaches the wire spacing. A possibility for improving this performance is to put two wire grids in tandem with their transmission axes parallel. Starting with the extended Mueller matrix description for a single wire grid, we present a mathematical treatment of this tandem polarizer showing that performance improves quadratically; e. g., a single polarizer extinction ratio of 100 increases to a tandem extinction of 10, 000. The improved performance is also verified experimentally. Several types of polarizer {{may be used to}} polarize IR light.

40|$|Infrared cameras can {{directly}} {{measure the}} apparent temperature of objects, providing thermal imaging. However, the raw output from most infrared cameras {{suffers from a}} strong, often limiting noise source called nonuniformity. Manufacturing imperfections in infrared focal planes lead to high pixel-to-pixel sensitivity to electronic bias, focal plane temperature, and other effects. In turn, different pixels within the focal plane array give a drastically different electronic response to the same irradiance. The resulting imagery can only provide useful thermal imaging after a nonuniformity calibration has been performed. Traditionally, these calibrations are performed by momentarily blocking {{the field of view}} with a flat temperature plate or blackbody cavity. However because the pattern is a coupling of manufactured sensitivities with operational variations, periodic recalibration is required, sometimes on the order of tens of seconds. A class of computational methods called Scene-Based Nonuniformity Correction (SBNUC) has been researched for over 20 years where the nonuniformity calibration is estimated in digital processing by analysis of the video stream in the presence of camera motion. The most sophisticated SBNUC methods can completely and robustly eliminate the high-spatial frequency component of nonuniformity with only an initial reference calibration or potentially no physical calibration.

40|$|A Motional Stark Effect (MSE) {{diagnostic}} {{system has been}} installed on the Alcator C-Mod tokamak to measure the plasma internal magnetic pitch angle profile. The diagnostic utilizes polarization patterns from Doppler-shifted Balmer-alpha decay emission from an energetic neutral beam injected into a magnetically confined plasma. This dissertation consists of three parts: (1) {{the current status of}} the C-Mod MSE diagnostic which includes major upgrades in the hardware and calibration techniques; (2) the elimination of the spurious drift in the polarization measurements due to thermal-stress induced birefringence; and (3) the measurement of current density profiles in Lower Hybrid Current Drive (LHCD) experiments. The major hardware upgrades include replacement of photomultiplier tubes (PMT's) with avalanche photodiodes (APD's) which enhanced the quantum efficiency; installation of <b>a</b> <b>wire-grid</b> <b>polarizer</b> to verify small Faraday rotation in the diagnostic; installation of steep edge filters to minimize pollution by the thermal Balmer-alpha signals; rotation of the Diagnostic Neutral Beam (DNB) which significantly reduced the anomalous effect from the secondary beam neutrals during the beam-into-gas calibrations. The new calibration techniques include two plasma calibrations: plasma current sweeping and the plasma size sweeping whose feasibility was experimentally proven; and an absolute intensity calibration which measured the real optical throughput of the system. A large database study indicates the signal-to-background ratio larger than 100 is required to have the measurement uncertainty under 0. 1 degrees. (cont.) The spurious drift in the measurement has been identified as the thermals tress induced birefringence imposed on the in-vessel lenses. By modeling this effect as a single wave plate, an in-situ calibration method has been proposed and its feasibility was experimentally verified. Based on the experiments that characterized the thermal response of the system, a single-layer heat shield with gold plating and a lens holder which reduces the thermal conduction path to the lens have been designed and fabricated. A more rigorous model that includes an intrinsic phase shift by mirrors reveals the thermal phase shift can be greatly magnified by the intrinsic phase shift. The current density profiles from LHCD experiments have been obtained from the MSE data corrected by a baseline magnetic equilibrium whose internal profile is constrained by the sawtooth inversion radius. The resultant profiles successfully demonstrate several standard predictions of LHCD theory such as the dependence of efficiency on the parallel refractive index and the off-axis current drive. by Jin-Seok Ko.

We investigated the optimal printing geometry of the polarizers by examining a number of samples with printed wires of varying thickness and spacing. We also investigated the polarization properties of multiply-stacked polarizers. Comment: To appear International Journal of Infrared and Millimeter Wave...|$|R
40|$|The optical {{properties}} of the <b>wire-grid</b> <b>polarizers</b> (WGP) were measured. In particular, the brightness and the contrast ratio of the projection system were investigated {{as a function of}} the incident angle of the light beam on the WGP, based on our experimental data. It was found that the optimal incident angle onto the WGP is dependent on the physical design of the polarizer, and is seldom 45 deg. At the optimal angle, both the transmission and reflection contrast can be quite good. However, WGP suffer from the drawback of large absorption due to free carrier absorption by the metal grid...|$|R
40|$|The POL- 2 {{polarimeter}} for the SCUBA- 2 10 000 pixel Terahertz {{camera on}} the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) in it's late state of commissioning. Proposals have been accepted for POL- 2 and general observing will start in August 2016. SCUBA- 2 has a field of view of 43 arcmin at both of the 850 and 450 μm focal planes. POL- 2 will map the sky in the the 850 μm band. The POL- 2 polarimeter utilizes three optical components: a half wave plate and two <b>wire-grid</b> <b>polarizers</b> used as calibrator and analyzer covering the full field of SCUBA- 2. We describe the instrument, data acquisition and features/artifacts that have been encountered during the commissioning...|$|R
