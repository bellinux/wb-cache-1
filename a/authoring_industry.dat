2500|$|A 2011 {{study done}} to {{disclose}} possible conflicts of interests in underlying research studies used for medical meta-analyses [...] reviewed 29 meta-analyses {{and found that}} conflicts of interests in the studies underlying the meta-analyses were rarely disclosed. [...] The 29 meta-analyses included 11 from general medicine journals; 15 from specialty medicine journals, and 3 from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The 29 meta-analyses reviewed an aggregate of 509 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Of these, 318 RCTs reported funding sources with 219 (69%) industry funded. 132 of the 509 RCTs reported author conflict of interest disclosures, with 91 studies (69%) disclosing industry financial ties {{with one or more}} authors. The information was, however, seldom reflected in the meta-analyses. Only two (7%) reported RCT funding sources and none reported RCT author-industry ties.

40|$|Please {{address all}} {{correspondence}} to second <b>author)</b> <b>Industry</b> is only using 20 % of the heat subtracted from fossil fuels. The other 80 % is released to the surroundings leading {{to an increase in}} the global warming effect. In contrast to this, the output of a heat pump is always more than the input, it delivers up to 67 % energy savings, has less pollution than conventional heating methods and has a smaller influence on the greenhouse effect because it delivers less carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than other heating methods. The performance of a heat pump is influenced by the properties of the refrigerant that is used. The refrigerant that is mostly used in hot water heat pumps is R 22. It supplies hot water at temperatures of 60 to 65 °C. In this study it is theoretically shown that a non- azeotropic refrigerant mixture of R 22 and R 142 b has the potential to increase the COP, reduce the pressure ratio of the compressor, maintain chemical stability of refrigerant and lubrication oil, increase heating capacity and display the feature of varying the heating capacity with load. The main aim {{of this study is to}} design and evaluate a hot water heat pump that uses a non-azeotropic refrigerant mixture, so that the potential of a non- azeotropic refrigerant mixture may be determined...|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{competitive}} markets with asymmetric information, the authors develop a model of firms' branding decisions. In equilibrium, both branded and unbranded products exist, and the authors characterize price-quality relationships between them. In contrast to other advertising models, they predict that branded products will have lower average (price-adjusted) quality than unbranded products. This lower average is counterbalanced by lower variance in product quality, giving branding a risk-reducing rather than a quality-guaranteeing functions. The <b>authors</b> describe <b>industries</b> in which these relationships {{are likely to be}} stronger and test the predictions using Consumer Reports data on quality and price.

Production units that embody the newest process and product innovations are continuously being created and outdated units are being destroyed. Although outdated units {{are the most}} likely to turn unprofitable and be scrapped in a recession, they can be 'insulated' from the fall in demand by a reduction in creation. The structure of adjustment costs plays a determinant role in the responsiveness of those two margins. The calibrated model matches the relative volatilities of the observed manufacturing job creation and destruction series, and their asymmetries over the cycle.
