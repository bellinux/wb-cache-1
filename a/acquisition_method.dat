40|$|International audienceThe {{deployment}} of the European global navigation satellite system, Galileo, with its specific signal structure, encourages {{the development of new}} signal processing methods at the receiver level. In particular, the structure and characteristics of the Galileo E 1 OS signal make its acquisition not easy and require optimization to reduce computation time and complexity. The present article proposes a novel Galileo E 1 OS signal <b>acquisition</b> <b>method.</b> The background technique to do so is taken from an existing GPS L 1 signal <b>acquisition</b> <b>method,</b> the Double Block Zero Padding (DBZP). This paper provides the detailed description (including the mathematical model) of the DBZP and shows its theoretical performance in terms of probability of detection and number of operations. Based on this analysis, the paper proposes an improvement of the DBZP for signals, like Galileo E 1 OS, that include frequent bit transitions.

40|$|Abstract- This paper proposes an <b>acquisition</b> <b>method</b> using a code-orthogonalizing filter (COF) in an ultra wideband-impulse radio (UWB-IR) {{multiple}} access communication system with time hopping / spread spectrum (TH/SS). In the COF of this system, the particular template signal of the TH system is adopted. By using a COF, {{multiple access}} interferences are suppressed, and orthogonalization of an own-sequence is achieved. Then, calculating {{the correlation between}} the coefficients of a COF and the own-sequence of in-phase, the synchronous phase can be obtained. It is shown that the proposed method can be superior to the conventional sliding correlator when the number of users increases.

40|$|Aims: The {{reliability}} and agreement between {{shear wave elastography}} (SWE) systems using different <b>acquisition</b> <b>methods</b> in muscles is not yet established. The objectives were to determine the reliability of a new SWE system on normal resting muscles using different <b>acquisition</b> <b>methods</b> and to compare its performance to an established state-of-the-art system. Material and methods: Small, medium and large ROI sizes in addition to longitudinal, oblique and transverse orientations over five different locations within the rectus femoris muscle were tested using the new system. Results were compared to the established system to test for inter-system reproducibility. Results: Lowest within-subject coefficient of variance (4. 3 %) and shear wave velocity (1. 83 m/s) {{were associated with the}} medium ROI and longitudinal orientation from the lateral location. This combination resulted in a strong internal agreement of intra-class correlation of 0. 76 (0. 57 – 0. 89) for the new system and an almost perfect agreement of 0. 92 (0. 82 – 0. 97) for the established. Inter-system reproducibility for the best combination was 0. 71 (0. 48 – 1) with a mean velocity difference ± 95 % limits of agreement of 0. 07 ± 0. 49 m/s. Conclusions: Altering SWE <b>acquisition</b> <b>methods</b> can produce variable results.
