5|$|Animal Sacrifice of <b>a</b> <b>buffalo</b> or goat, {{particularly}} during smallpox epidemics, has been practiced {{in parts of}} South India. The sacrificed animal is dedicated to a goddess, and is probably related to the myth of goddess Kali in Andhra Pradesh, but in Karnataka, the typical goddess is Renuka. According to Alf Hiltebeitel – a professor of Religions, History and Human Sciences, these ritual animal sacrifices, with some differences, mirrors goddess-related ritual animal sacrifice found in Gilgamesh epic and in texts of Egyptian, Minoan and Greek sources.|$|E

5|$|As {{in other}} {{agricultural}} societies, Torajans dance and sing during harvest time. The Ma'bugi dance celebrates the thanksgiving event, and the Ma'gandangi dance is performed while Torajans are pounding rice. There are several war dances, {{such as the}} Manimbong dance performed by men, followed by the Ma'dandan dance performed by women. The aluk religion governs when and how Torajans dance. A dance called Ma'bua can be performed only once every 12 years. Ma'bua is a major Toraja ceremony in which priests wear <b>a</b> <b>buffalo</b> head and dance around a sacred tree.|$|E
5|$|Entering 2008, the Bulls {{sought to}} build off of their 2007 season, where {{they shared the}} MAC East {{championship}} but did {{not appear in the}} championship game due to a 31–28 loss to fellow division co-champion Miami (Ohio). Their 5–7 final record, while not good enough to qualify for a bowl game, was still the best by <b>a</b> <b>Buffalo</b> team since they had moved up to Division I-A in 1999. With 10 starters returning on offense and eight on defense, the 2008 team was predicted to be perhaps the most talented team in Bulls history; however, due to their challenging schedule, their final record was predicted to be no better than 3–9.|$|E
5|$|The Bulls {{were led}} offensively by the triple threat of quarterback Drew Willy, running back James Starks, and wide {{receiver}} Namaan Roosevelt. The three combined to break 14single-season school records, including most points scored in a season (404). Willy, heading into his final game as <b>a</b> <b>Buffalo</b> Bull, had already surpassed the 3,000-yard mark in passing on the season, throwing for 25touchdowns against only fiveinterceptions. Starks, while not seen as the same caliber of player as UConn's Donald Brown, had run for over 1,300yards and caught 41passes for 340yards, scoring 16touchdowns on the year. Roosevelt {{was seen as the}} top playmaker, going over the 100-yard mark in each of Buffalo's last fivegames and scoring at least once in his last seven.|$|E

5|$|The Markendeya Purana praises Varahi as a granter of boons and the regent of the Northern direction, in a hymn {{where the}} Matrikas are {{declared}} as the protectors of the directions.

The Mother promises the gods that the Matrikas will fight demons when needed. In the Raktabija episode, Varahi is described as having a boar form, fighting demons with her tusks while seated on a preta (corpse).|$|E
5|$|The panel issued {{over 500}} recommendations, {{including}} limiting {{the growth of}} the Banff townsite, capping the town's population at 10,000, placing quotas for popular hiking trails, and curtailing development in the park. Another recommendation was to fence off the townsite to reduce confrontations between people and elk. The proposed fencing was also intended to reduce access to this refuge for elk from predators, such as wolves that tended to avoid the townsite. Upon release of the report, Copps immediately moved to accept the proposal to cap the town population. She also ordered a small airstrip to be removed, along with <b>a</b> <b>buffalo</b> paddock, and cadet camp, that inhibited wildlife movement.|$|E
5|$|To {{open the}} season, the All-Americans {{defeated}} the local, semi-pro team West Buffalo. Running back John Weldon scored a rushing touchdown {{early in the}} first quarter. Quarterback Tommy Hughitt and Weldon added touchdowns {{in the second quarter}} to make the score 19–0 going into halftime. Hughitt scored from a yard out in the third quarter to make the score 25–0. West Buffalo got on the scoreboard when Bob Langdon intercepted <b>a</b> <b>Buffalo</b> pass and ran it back 75yards for a touchdown. This was West Buffalo's only points scored their entire year. Buffalo finished off the scoring in the fourth quarter and won the game 32–6.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from these}} sculptures, entire {{sequences}} from the Hindu epics (commonly the Ramayana and the Mahabharata) have been sculpted in a clockwise direction {{starting at the}} main entrance. The right to left sequence is the same direction taken by the devotees in their ritual circumambulation as they wind inward toward the inner sanctum. Depictions from mythology such as the epic hero Arjuna shooting fish, the elephant-headed god Ganesha, the Sun god Surya, the weather and war god Indra, and Brahma with Sarasvati are common. Also frequently seen in these temples is Durga, with several arms holding weapons given to her by other gods, {{in the act of}} killing <b>a</b> <b>buffalo</b> (a demon in a buffalo's form) and Harihara (a fusion of Shiva and Vishnu) holding a conch, wheel and trident. Many of these friezes were signed by the artisans, the first known instance of signed artwork in India.|$|E
5|$|No.1 AD {{undertook}} {{research and}} development on various aircraft types, including Supermarine Spitfires, CAC Boomerangs, and Wackett Woomeras. It also ran comparative performance studies on Spitfires, Boomerangs, Kittyhawks, Brewster Buffalos, and Mitsubishi Zeros. In {{the case of the}} Boomerang, 105 CA-12 models were delivered to No.1 AD for testing between July 1942 and June 1943. As soon as the aircraft began arriving, the depot commenced handling and armament trials that continued for six months, identifying and overcoming such issues as the aircraft's guns freezing at high altitudes, and unusual levels of carbon monoxide in the cockpit. Fighter aces Alan Rawlinson and Wilfred Arthur, along with a United States Army Air Forces pilot, conducted comparative trials between a Boomerang, a Kittyhawk, <b>a</b> <b>Buffalo,</b> and a Bell Airacobra. The depot began despatching the Boomerangs to their operational units in March 1943, and the following month performance-tested a turbocharged version of the CA-14, though this model never entered production. No.1 AD's Special Duties and Performance Flight was responsible for conducting performance trials during the early war years; in December 1943 it became a separate organisation, No.1 Aircraft Performance Unit, which would evolve into the Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU) in 1947.|$|E
5|$|Torajans perform dances {{on several}} occasions, most often during their {{elaborate}} funeral ceremonies. They dance {{to express their}} grief, and to honour and even cheer the deceased person because {{he is going to}} have a long journey in the afterlife. First, a group of men form a circle and sing a monotonous chant throughout the night to honour the deceased (a ritual called Ma'badong). This is considered by many Torajans to be the most important component of the funeral ceremony. On the second funeral day, the Ma'randing warrior dance is performed to praise the courage of the deceased during life. Several men perform the dance with a sword, a large shield made from buffalo skin, a helmet with <b>a</b> <b>buffalo</b> horn, and other ornamentation. The Ma'randing dance precedes a procession in which the deceased is carried from a rice barn to the rante, the site of the funeral ceremony. During the funeral, elder women perform the Ma'katia dance while singing a poetic song and wearing a long feathered costume. The Ma'akatia dance is performed to remind the audience of the generosity and loyalty of the deceased person. After the bloody ceremony of buffalo and pig slaughter, a group of boys and girls clap their hands while performing a cheerful dance called Ma'dondan.|$|E

5|$|On March 26, 2012, Young {{signed on}} {{a minor league}} deal with the Mets. He had {{recently}} undergone surgery to repair a torn anterior capsule in his right shoulder. He spent the first 33 days of the season on the triple <b>A</b> <b>Buffalo</b> Bisons' disabled list before being activated on May 10. Young subsequently made three starts with the single A St. Lucie Mets on May 11, May 16 and 25 before being promoted back to Buffalo on May 27. He compiled a 1–0 record with 3.18 ERA in 17.0 innings during the three starts. On May 31, he pitched 6 scoreless innings for the Bisons against the Columbus Clippers. The Mets announced on June 4 that they would call Young up to the major league roster on June 5. On June 5, 2012, Young made his return against the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park with the Mets, giving up 3 runs (2 earned) over 5 innings {{in a game that}} was eventually decided in 12 innings. On June 6 his wife gave birth and he was placed on a paternity leave, which was not intended to interfere with his June 10 scheduled start. The move was for the purpose of freeing up a roster spot during Young's off days under a Major League Baseball rule that allows for a three-day leave. Young made his next start on June 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays, earning his first win in over a year.|$|E
