5|$|Like other {{spitting}} cobras, {{this species}} {{is known for}} its ability to project venom at <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> <b>threat.</b> The venom is an irritant to the skin and eyes. If it enters the eyes, symptoms include extreme burning pain, loss of coordination, partial loss of vision, and permanent blindness. N. nigricollis {{is known for its}} tendency to liberally spit venom and bite with only the slightest provocation.|$|E

5|$|As the {{intelligence}} {{available to them}} was not conclusive, the Allies believed that Tirpitz still posed <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> <b>threat.</b> Accordingly, Nos. 9 and 617 Squadrons made two further attacks on the battleship after she moved to Tromsø on 15 October; these operations were more straightforward to conduct than Operation Paravane as the port was {{within the range of}} Lancasters flying from airfields in northern Scotland. The first raid, Operation Obviate, took place on 29 October but caused only minor damage to the battleship. During the subsequent attack conducted on 12 November, Operation Catechism, Tirpitz was struck by several Tallboy bombs and capsized with heavy loss of life among her crew.|$|E
5|$|Breeding densities {{have been}} {{recorded}} as between 0.1–6.6pairs/10ha (0.04–2.7pairs/10acres), with the greatest densities in mature forest growing on alluvium. Numbers have increased in Europe due to the planting of forests, which provides breeding habitat, and more available dead wood, and this species has profited from its flexibility with regard to types of woodland {{and its ability to}} thrive in proximity to humans. Harsh winters are a problem, and fragmentation of woodland can cause local difficulties. The Canary Islands populations of D. m. canariensis on Tenerife and D. m. thanneri on Gran Canaria face <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> <b>threat</b> from exploitation of the local pine forests.|$|E
5|$|This high {{concentration}} and oppressive {{treatment of the}} slave population led to rebellions. In 135 BC and 104 BC, the First and Second Servile Wars, respectively, erupted in Sicily, where small bands of rebels found {{tens of thousands of}} willing followers wishing to escape the oppressive life of a Roman slave. While these were considered serious civil disturbances by the Roman Senate, taking years and direct military intervention to quell, they were never considered a serious threat to the Republic. The Roman heartland had never seen a slave uprising, nor had slaves ever been seen as <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> <b>threat</b> to the city of Rome. This would all change with the Third Servile War.|$|E

5|$|Where {{it lives}} {{alongside}} the blue wildebeest, {{the two species}} can hybridise, and this is regarded as <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> <b>threat</b> {{to the maintenance of}} the species. The black wildebeest was once very numerous and was present in southern Africa in vast herds {{but by the end of}} the nineteenth century, it had nearly been hunted to extinction and fewer than 600 animals remained. A small number of individuals was still present in game reserves and at zoos and it is from these that the population was rescued.|$|E
5|$|Though {{initially}} {{perceived to}} be <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> <b>threat</b> to The Bahamas and Florida due to its westward motion, the hurricane curved northward on September13, mitigating any evacuation procedures. Despite the storm's change in track, the United States Weather Bureau cautioned shipping interests in the outlying islands of the Bahamas. Pan American World Airways was forced to postpone two transatlantic flights from New York City to Portugal due to the storm. After the hurricane recurved, the Weather Bureau advised caution to areas of the New England coast, particularly in Nantucket and Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where strong winds and waves were anticipated. Storm warnings were posted for coastal areas from Hatteras, North Carolina to Eastport, Maine on September16. The warnings were discontinued after the hurricane passed the warned areas.|$|E
5|$|Today, many {{wildebeest}} {{populations are}} experiencing rapid declines. Overland migration as a biological process requires large connected landscapes, which are {{increasingly difficult to}} maintain, particularly over the long term, when human demands on the landscape compete. The most acute threat comes from migration barriers, such as fences and roads. In {{one of the more}} striking examples of the consequences of fence-building on terrestrial migrations, Botswanan authorities placed thousands of kilometres of fences across the Kalahari that prevented wildebeests from reaching watering holes and grazing grounds, resulting in the deaths {{of tens of thousands of}} individuals, reducing the wildebeest population to less than 10% of its previous size. Illegal hunting is a major conservation concern in many areas, along with natural threats posed by main predators (such as lions, leopards, hunting dogs and hyenas). Where the black and blue wildebeest share a common range, the two can hybridise, and this is regarded as <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> <b>threat</b> to the black wildebeest.|$|E

5|$|In 1921 the Protocol of Corfu was annulled {{during the}} Conference of Ambassadors and Northern Epirus was {{definitively}} ceded to the Albanian state. However attempts to re-establish an autonomous Northern Epirus continued. In 1921 the Albanian government, during the country's {{entrance to the}} League of Nations, committed itself {{to protect the rights}} of minorities within its territory, which were ratified by the local Parliament next year. However, these rights were granted within a much more limited area compared to the Protocol, which included only some villages in the regions of Himara, Gjirokastër and Sarande, and none of the main towns. Moreover, Greek education was viewed as <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> <b>threat</b> to the territorial integrity of the Albanian state and Greek schools were either closed or converted to Albanian ones. As a result of this policy, education in Greek was limited and for a time virtually eliminated (1934–1935). Only after the intervention of the Permanent Court of International Justice, in April 1935, did the Albanian side allow the reopening of Greek-language schools and waive its insistence on the use of Albanian in Greek schools.|$|E
5|$|The floodwaters {{from the}} {{hurricane}} combined with raw sewage in many poor areas of southwestern Mexico, {{leading to a}} widespread threat for a spread of tropical diseases. As a result, government health workers opened vaccination centers in several cities along the Guerrero and Oaxaca coasts. Thousands were inoculated for typhoid fever and tetanus. Officials noted <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> <b>threat</b> for dengue and cholera {{as a result of}} the spoiled water. Health workers also stated mosquitos possessing malaria and dengue fever were likely to breed in large areas of leftover water. In Acapulco, about two days after the hurricane passed, the first day of sun in a week evaporated the areas of leftover water, spreading dust across the region with the deadly diseases. Residents were warned to boil their food and water for 30minutes due to the threat for contamination by the dust. At least twenty cases of cholera and at least six cases of dengue fever were reported. Most significantly, there were 14,630cases of malaria in 616villages in Oaxaca due to Pauline; this represented about 80% of the malaria cases in Mexico during 1998. Army soldiers distributed chlorine tablets to disinfect water pools and wheelbarrows to remove rotting mud and sewage from their damaged homes. Two C-130 Hercules planes and twenty helicopters airlifted food and water to smaller villages south of Acapulco that were stranded for nearly a week after the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|With the {{subtropical}} ridge to its north, Isa tracked {{to the north}} and gradually curved to the west. It slowly intensified, due to it being a large tropical cyclone, and late on April 13 JTWC upgraded the storm to typhoon status; at the same time, JMA continued to assess Isa as a minimal tropical storm, and did not upgrade it to a typhoon until April 16. Isa maintained a nearly due-westward movement, although tropical cyclone prediction models anticipated a quick turn to the north. The JTWC recognized the northward model bias, which was described as under-analyzing the strength of the {{subtropical ridge}}. By April 16, the typhoon attained the equivalence of a Category3 tropical cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and despite <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> <b>threat</b> to Guam the typhoon remained 260km (160mi) south of the island. It gradually curved to the north, and on April 20 JTWC classified Super Typhoon Isa as reaching peak 1-min winds of 270km/h (165mph). At this point, Isa became an annular typhoon, with a large eye and a lack of spiralform rainbands, while moving nearly due northward, through a weakness in the subtropical ridge. Simultaneously, JMA assessed the typhoon as attaining peak 10-min winds of 155km/h (100mph).|$|E

5|$|After Phocas's fall, Heraclius became {{emperor of}} Byzantium. The Patriarch Nikephoros claims in his Short History that the crown was first offered to Priscus, who refused it. As {{commander}} of the excubitores, a protopatrikios (first among the patrician order) {{and one of the}} few senior and influential officials with ties to past regimes, Priscus represented <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> <b>threat</b> to Heraclius. Nevertheless, facing a critical situation in the East, where the Persians had overrun much territory and were raiding Anatolia, Heraclius appointed Priscus in command of the Anatolian army in the autumn of 611. The Persian general Shahin captured Caesarea in Cappadocia, only to be blockaded and besieged there by Priscus. Heraclius himself decided to visit the army camp at Caesarea during winter, but Priscus refused to meet him, on the pretext of an illness. This snub alienated Heraclius from his general, and when Shahin and his army managed to break out and escape in summer, Priscus was recalled to Constantinople, ostensibly to become godfather to the Byzantine emperor's son, Heraclius Constantine. At the capital, he was removed from his post as comes excubitorum, which went to Heraclius's cousin Nicetas, while command in Anatolia went to the other surviving general of Maurice, Philippicus, brought out of retirement. Priscus was brought before the Byzantine Senate and accused by Heraclius of treason. In the end, he was tonsured as a monk on 5 December 612 and confined in the Monastery of the Chora, where he died in 613.|$|E

40|$|Behavioural {{responses}} of wetland fauna to humans constitutes <b>a</b> <b>potential</b> conservation <b>threat,</b> and may alter how animals use wetlands and their surrounds. We {{predicted that the}} farther from refuge (i. e. water) that terrestrially foraging rails occurred, the longer the distance at which they would become alert when approached. We found that the distance at which Eurasian Coot, Fulica atra, Purple Swamphen, Porphyrio porphyrio, and Dusky Moorhen, Gallinula tenebrosa became alert to an approaching predator (i. e. human) increased with distance from the shore of a wetland (species and starting distance were not significant but associated with low power). Thus, these behavioural measures suggest these birds use water in wetlands as <b>a</b> refuge from <b>potential</b> <b>threats</b> such as people. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|R
