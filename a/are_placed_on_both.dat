Uncommonly, the bifrontal placement in used; this involves positioning the electrodes on the patient's forehead, roughly above each eye.|$|E
25|$|A Roomette, in the {{historically}} correct {{sense of the}} word, is a private room for a single passenger, containing a single seat, a folding bed, a toilet (not in a private cubicle of its own), and a washbasin. When a traditional Roomette is in night mode, the bed blocks access to the toilet. Like open sections, Roomettes <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>both</b> sides of the car, with a corridor down the center. Duplex Roomettes are staggered vertically, with every second accommodation raised a few feet above the car's floor level, {{in order to make}} slightly more efficient use of the space. Single-passenger Slumbercoach accommodations are a particularly Spartan form of Roomette.|$|E

50|$|Planes {{take-off}} {{and land}} {{into the wind}} {{in order to achieve}} maximum performance. Because pilots need instantaneous information during landing, a windsock is also kept in view of the runway.

50|$|Slipform Stonemasonry: Slipform stonemasonry is {{a method}} for making stone walls {{with the aid of}} {{formwork}} to contain the rocks and mortar while keeping the walls straight. Short forms, up to two feet tall, <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>both</b> sides of the wall to serve as a guide for the stone work. Stones are placed inside the forms with the good faces against the form work. Concrete is poured behind the rocks. Rebar is added for strength, to make a wall that is approximately half reinforced concrete and half stonework. The wall can be faced with stone on one side or both sides.|$|E

5000|$|The {{key to the}} {{development}} of the transistor was the further understanding of the process of the electron mobility in a semiconductor. It was realized that if there were some way to control the flow of the electrons from the emitter to the collector of this newly discovered diode, an amplifier could be built. For instance, if contacts <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>both</b> sides of a single type of crystal, current will not flow between them through the crystal. However if a third contact could then [...] "inject" [...] electrons or holes into the material, current would flow.|$|E
5000|$|In {{unilateral}} ECT, both electrodes {{are placed}} {{on the same side}} of the patient's head. Unilateral ECT may be used first to minimize side effects (memory loss). When electrodes <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> <b>both</b> sides of the head, this is known as bilateral ECT. In bifrontal ECT, an uncommon variation, the electrode position is somewhere between bilateral and unilateral. Unilateral is thought to cause fewer cognitive effects than bilateral but is considered less effective if the dose administered is close to the seizure threshold. In the US most patients receive bilateral ECT. [...] In the UK almost all patients receive bilateral ECT.|$|E
