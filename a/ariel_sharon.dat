5|$|Habes al-Majali {{is quoted}} as the only Arab {{commander}} to have defeated the Israelis in 1948 and who restored a little honour to the Arabs. By his version of events, he would even have caught <b>Ariel</b> <b>Sharon</b> {{in the course of}} the battle and it is Colonel Ashton (his British superior from 3rd Brigade) would have forbidden him to use the artillery against the Burma road, action by which he could have prevented its construction. After the war, he was appointed bodyguard of Abdallah and in 1957 Chief-of-Staff of the Jordanian Army. He became Jordanian Minister of Defence in 1967.|$|E
5|$|On 28 September 2000, {{two days}} before the shooting, the Israeli {{opposition}} leader <b>Ariel</b> <b>Sharon</b> visited the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem, a holy site in both Judaism and Islam with contested rules of access. The violence that followed had its roots in several events, but the visit was provocative and triggered protests that escalated into rioting across the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The uprising became known as the Second Intifada; it lasted over four years and cost around 4,000 lives, over 3,000 of them Palestinian.|$|E
5|$|On October 14, {{immediately}} following the Egyptian offensive, Israeli Chief of Staff David Elazar presented the general outlines of a crossing operation of the Suez Canal to the Israeli cabinet in a meeting in Tel Aviv. Elazar emphasized the military and political gains of the operation, and the expected collapse that would occur in the Egyptian forces on the east bank when their supply routes became threatened. Elazar received unanimous support from the cabinet. Later that day, Bar-Lev headed a meeting attended by the senior and main division commanders in the Sinai theatre: Major Generals Abraham Adan, <b>Ariel</b> <b>Sharon</b> and Kalman Magen. Bar-Lev informed the Israeli officers {{of the decision to}} begin the crossing operation on the night of October 15/16, and assigned duties and responsibilities to the division commanders.|$|E
5|$|On 28September2000, then-opposition {{leader of}} Israel <b>Ariel</b> <b>Sharon</b> {{and members of}} the Likud Party, along with 1,000 armed guards, visited the al-Aqsa compound; a large group of Palestinians went to protest the visit. After Sharon and the Likud Party members left, a {{demonstration}} erupted and Palestinians {{on the grounds of the}} Haram al-Sharif began throwing stones and other projectiles at Israeli riot police. Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at the crowd, injuring 24 people. The visit sparked a five-year uprising by the Palestinians, commonly referred to as the al-Aqsa Intifada, though some commentators, citing subsequent speeches by PA officials, particularly Imad Falouji and Arafat himself, claim that the Intifada had been planned months in advance, as early as July upon Yasser Arafat's return from Camp David talks. On 29September, the Israeli government deployed 2,000 riot police to the mosque. When a group of Palestinians left the mosque after Friday prayers (Jumu'ah,) they hurled stones at the police. The police then stormed the mosque compound, firing both live ammunition and rubber bullets at the group of Palestinians, killing four and wounding about 200.|$|E
5|$|The failed Egyptian {{offensive}} {{gave the}} initiative to the Israelis, who immediately launched Operation Abiray-Lev, aiming to cross the canal between two Egyptian armies in order to encircle Egyptian forces on the east banks and cut their supply lines. Optimistically planned, the operation began smoothly, but quickly ran into problems. The Israelis faced difficulties in establishing a corridor to the canal due to unexpectedly determined resistance by Egyptian defenses, in {{what became known as}} the Battle of the Chinese Farm. After several days of heavy fighting, they were able to secure the roads to the canal, and by October 18 had two bridges laid down at Deversoir, at the northern end of the Great Bitter Lake. By the next day there were three Israeli armored divisions across the canal. Two advanced south toward Suez City, while the 143rd Armored Division under Major General <b>Ariel</b> <b>Sharon</b> advanced north to seize Ismailia, hoping to sever the supply lines to three Egyptian divisions of the Second Field Army across the canal.|$|E

25|$|Stephen Crittenden: No {{prizes for}} Australian audiences {{guessing}} that {{the prize for}} the most Islamophobic international politician went to <b>Ariel</b> <b>Sharon</b> last year, but I was rather shocked to see that on your website, <b>Ariel</b> <b>Sharon</b> is nominated for an interview in which he described wanting to burn Palestinian children and encouraging his soldiers to rape Arabic girls, and describing Palestinian women as ‘slaves for Jews’, all of which you say yourselves on your website, comes from an interview that can’t be verified for its authenticity.|$|E

25|$|With {{the fall}} of the Barak {{government}} in late 2000, Netanyahu expressed his desire to return to politics. By law, Barak's resignation was supposed to lead to elections for the prime minister position only. Netanyahu insisted that general elections should be held, claiming that otherwise {{it would be impossible to}} have a stable government. Netanyahu decided eventually not to run for the prime minister position, a move which facilitated the surprising rise to power of <b>Ariel</b> <b>Sharon,</b> who at the time was considered less popular than Netanyahu. In 2002, after the Israeli Labor Party left the coalition and vacated the position of foreign minister, Prime Minister <b>Ariel</b> <b>Sharon</b> appointed Netanyahu as Foreign Minister. Netanyahu challenged Sharon for the leadership of the Likud party, but failed to oust Sharon.|$|E

25|$|The OutRage! {{presence}} {{was greeted with}} hostility by some other demonstrators, and Tatchell claims they {{accused him of being}} a Mossad agent sent to disrupt the march, of being a racist or a Zionist, a supporter of <b>Ariel</b> <b>Sharon</b> or an agent of the Central Intelligence Agency or MI5. Tatchell has written a number of articles in The Guardian on the issue.|$|E
25|$|The action proved {{controversial}} inside Israel. The settlers, {{backed by}} the right-wing, {{as shown in the}} Likud referendum, claimed Israel had a historic right to the land and that they provided an important defense buffer against attacks by Palestinians. The conservative government of Prime Minister <b>Ariel</b> <b>Sharon</b> argued that remaining in Gaza was too costly in both money and lives.|$|E
25|$|After the {{collapse}} of Barak's government, <b>Ariel</b> <b>Sharon</b> was elected Prime Minister on February 6, 2001.

25|$|Tariq A.

I vow that I’ll burn every Palestinian child (that) will be born in this area.’”).|$|E
