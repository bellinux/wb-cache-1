[...] He often writes directions about how the actors should hold their hands, turn their heads, or change their facial expressions to include a narrowing of their eyes. The longest script notation that Albee writes occurs toward the end of act 3, before a monologue delivered by the character Tobias. Albee’s directions read: [...] "This next is an aria.

SPLURGE came about as an idea {{to build up a}} book title recommendation service by pooling circulation data from university libraries in the province of Ontario. Following the precedent of a project that was launched by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) in the United Kingdom, a group of Systems folks in Ontario met and surmised {{it would be interesting to}} start collecting circulation data that could then be fed back into the school’s various catalogue interfaces. The data would make it possible to provide context-sensitive book suggestions, to researchers, in the search results: in the manner Amazon or EBay recommends items for purchase to its shoppers. Following the launch of a GitHub site for the project and armed with only a rough outline of the goals, over twenty five people from sixteen institutions gathered for a single hackfest event to explore and discuss the possible paths to further bring SPLURGE into fruition. Is this another add-on that will serve to simply spoon-feed our users? Or, will SPLURGE zestfully put the dip back into serendipity for those researchers who might have otherwise not connected potential resources in their initial catalogue queries?

A sportsman will find great convenience in having a third nick cut in the tumbler of his lock, so as to give an additional low half-cock, at which the cock just clears the nipple; it will prevent the cap from falling off or receiving a blow. I have long used this plan, and find no objections to it: many pistols are furnished with this contrivance. Careless gun-makers sometimes make this catch so low, that when the cock is lifted a little back from it, and let go, it strikes the cap by reason of the elasticity of its metal, and lets off the gun: the traveller should beware of this fault of workmanship.|$|E

The glory of such exploits is not apparent; their power for degradation strikes the eyes.

Three weeks on from its release, it is still doing the rounds on Twitter and achieving a certain level of public consciousness with its own series of jokes.
