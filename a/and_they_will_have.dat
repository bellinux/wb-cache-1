However, they will have one fewer hour of daylight at the start of each day, making the policy less practical during winter.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Onn Ja'afar {{proposed}} to open UMNO membership to all Malayans, and renaming it the United Malayan National Organisation, {{which would have}} diluted its identity {{as a champion of}} ketuanan Melayu. Defeated in an internal power struggle, he resigned in 1951 to found the Independence of Malaya Party (IMP). He was succeeded by Tunku Abdul Rahman (often known as [...] "the Tunku"), who insisted on initial Malay sovereignty. Expressing concern over a lack of loyalty to Malaya among non-Malays, he demanded they clarify their allegiance before being accorded citizenship, going on to state: [...] "For those who love and feel they owe undivided loyalty to this country, we will welcome them as Malayans. They must truly be Malayans, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> the same rights and privileges as the Malays." [...] Not long after, in 1952, however, he appeared to contradict himself, and insisted that Malays safeguard their special position: [...] "Malaya is for the Malays and it should not be governed by a mixture of races." ...|$|E
500|$|Ed Fries, head of Microsoft Studios' {{publishing}} {{division at}} the time of acquisition, said that the company attempted to preserve Rare's culture so its staff could continue feeling that they worked for Rare rather than Microsoft. Rare employees differed about working conditions after the Microsoft acquisition. According to Star Fox Adventures lead engineer Phil Tossell, conditions became more stressful after an [...] "imperceptible" [...] start, and the culture of the two companies began clashing with each other. Tossell said that Microsoft gradually imposed a corporate structure on Rare, including more performance reviews and meetings, to which some Rare members found difficulty in adapting. Some admitted that early changes, such as permitting team members to discuss projects they were not working on and allowing staff members to use the internet or listen to music during work hours, were beneficial to team morale. Betteridge called the overall change [...] "positive", saying that Microsoft's capital could help Rare develop their projects. Former Rare employee Gavin Price said that some Microsoft executives, such as Phil Spencer, were supportive of the developer. Grant Kirkhope, a former composer at Rare, strongly criticised Microsoft for ruining Rare. Fansite Rare-Extreme documented {{a day in the life}} at Rare in 2008 with two employees showing a 9 till 5 work schedule. Former Xbox executive Peter Moore voiced his disappointment with Rare's works after the acquisition. He noted that Rare employees were attempting to [...] "recreate the glory years", but their skills had become outdated and were no longer [...] "applicable in today's market". Duncan insisted that there were still a lot of talented people working at Rare, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> a [...] "bright future".|$|E

2500|$|The Reid Commission {{reported}} that Tunku Abdul Rahman and the Malay Rulers had asked that [...] "in an independent Malaya all nationals should be accorded equal rights, privileges and opportunities and there {{must not be}} discrimination on grounds of race and creed." [...] At that time, Tunku Abdul Rahman {{was the leader of}} the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), which led the Alliance coalition. Eventually the Alliance would become the Barisan Nasional and Tunku Abdul Rahman later became the first Prime Minister of Malaysia. When succeeding to the UMNO Presidency, Tunku had expressed doubts about the loyalty of the non-Malays to Malaya, and as a result, insisted that this be settled before they be granted citizenship. However, he also stated that [...] "For those who love and feel they owe undivided loyalty to this country, we will welcome them as Malayans. They must truly be Malayans, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> the same rights and privileges as the Malays." ...|$|E

She said that when the research is broken down, it shows that young gay men {{are one of the most}} risk-prone groups in Ireland. McAleese said many of these young men will have gone to Catholic schools <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> heard there their church's attitude to homosexuality. [...] "They will have heard words like 'disorder', they may even have heard the word 'evil' used in relation to homosexual practice," [...] she said. She went on to say [...] "And when they make the discovery, and it is a discovery and not a decision, when they make the discovery, that they are gay, when they are 14, 15 or 16, an internal conflict of absolutely appalling proportions opens up". She said many young gay men are driven into a place that is [...] "dark and bleak". McAleese said she met the Apostolic Nuncio, Archbishop Charles John Brown, shortly after Easter to raise with him her concern about the growing number of suicides among young men in Ireland.|$|E
