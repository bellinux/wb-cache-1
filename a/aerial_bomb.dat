By {{the end of the day}} the fort was surrounded, {{enduring}} heavy artillery and <b>aerial</b> <b>bomb</b> attacks, as well as infantry assault. The fort sustained heavy damage to its surface installations and the Germans entered the perimeter on 15 May, but did not take the fort. A 20 May assault was held off with help from the Fort de Battice. Another assault the next day brought the fort's surrender, as it was nearly out of ammunition. There were significant casualties on both sides during the battle. The fort's garrison was taken by the Germans to Königsberg in East Prussia for five years. During the German occupation the fort was used for bunker buster bombs testing like the Röchling shell, causing major damage. The Belgian Army, whose property the fort remains, decided to leave the damage rather than attempt to restore it in 1989.|$|E
