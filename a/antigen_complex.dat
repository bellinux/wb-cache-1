25|$|The major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) {{is a set of}} cell surface proteins essential for the acquired immune system to recognize foreign molecules in vertebrates, which in turn determines histocompatibility. The main function of MHC molecules is to bind to antigens derived from pathogens and display them on the cell surface for recognition by the appropriate T-cells. MHC molecules mediate interactions of leukocytes, also called white blood cells (WBCs), which are immune cells, with other leukocytes or with body cells. The MHC determines compatibility of donors for organ transplant, as well as one's susceptibility to an autoimmune disease via crossreacting immunization. The human MHC is also called the HLA (human leukocyte <b>antigen)</b> <b>complex</b> (often just the HLA). The mouse MHC is called the H-2 complex or H-2.|$|E
2500|$|Dendritic cells engulf {{exogenous}} pathogens, such as bacteria, parasites or toxins in {{the tissues}} and then migrate, via chemotactic signals, to the T cell-enriched lymph nodes. During migration, dendritic cells undergo {{a process of}} maturation in which they lose most {{of their ability to}} engulf other pathogens, and develop an ability to communicate with T-cells. [...] The dendritic cell uses enzymes to chop the pathogen into smaller pieces, called antigens. In the lymph node, the dendritic cell displays these non-self antigens on its surface by coupling them to a receptor called the major histocompatibility complex, or MHC (also known in humans as human leukocyte antigen (HLA)). This MHC: <b>antigen</b> <b>complex</b> is recognized by T-cells passing through the lymph node.

By using five previously characterized related secreted proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, MPT 44 (85 A), MPT 59 (85 B), MPT 45 (85 C), MPT 51 (27 kDa), and MPT 64 (26 kDa), we have identified at least 10 different MAb-reactive epitopes on the proteins of the <b>antigen</b> 85 <b>complex.</b> A heterogeneous distribution of epitopes was observed within {{the components of the}} <b>antigen</b> 85 <b>complex.</b> Two distinct epitopes specific for antigen 85 B and two other epitopes restricted to the 85 A and 85 B components were recognized. Two of them were shared with a previously unidentified 27 -kDa protein present in M. tuberculosis culture fluid from which all MPT proteins were derived. The rest of the MAb-reactive epitopes were found to be present mostly in antigens 85 A and 85 B {{and to a lesser extent}} in antigen 85 C. None of these MAbs recognized component 85 C alone nor did they bind to the related MPT 51 and MPT 64 proteins. Interestingly, most of the MAbs reacted with purified native proteins of the <b>antigen</b> 85 <b>complex</b> but not to them in their denatured forms. In contrast, reactivity of the MAbs with the cytosol fraction of M. tuberculosis in immunoblotting revealed that they bound to a closely related cytosolic 30 -kDa protein(s) even when they were denatured.

In this study, by using a novel series of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed to these antigens, we identified and partially characterized three unique epitopes (Rb 2, Pe 12, and A 2 h 11) that are shared between mycobacterial hsp 65 and the individual components of the <b>antigen</b> 85 <b>complex.</b> Dot blot assays with native purified proteins revealed that all three MAbs are strongly bound to hsp 65 and antigens 85 A (MPT 44) and 85 B (MPT 59), while a weak reaction or no reaction was found with antigen 85 C (MPT 45). Immunoblotting showed that MAb Rb 2 reacted strongly with both hsp 65 and the <b>antigen</b> 85 <b>complex</b> proteins, whereas MAbs Pe 12 and A 2 h 11 reacted strongly with the former but weakly with the latter. Moreover, these MAbs did not react with other closely related MPT 51 and MPT 64 secreted proteins. Further characterization of these epitopes was performed by using recombinant fusion and truncated proteins of Mycobacterium bovis BCG hsp 65 (MbaA) and the M. leprae 30 - and 31 -kDa <b>antigen</b> 85 <b>complex</b> fusion proteins. In hsp 65, Rb 2 -Pe 12 - and A 2 h 11 -reactive epitopes were found to reside in the C-terminal region of amino acid residues 479 to 540 and 303 to 424, respectively.

By analyzing the nucleotide sequences of the genes for O-antigen biosynthesis including wba operon and the central variable regions of the H 1 and H 2 flagellin genes in Salmonella, designated PCR primers for two multiplex PCR reactions were used to detect and differentiate Salmonella serogroups A/D 1, B, C 1, C 2, or E 1; H 1 antigen types i, g, m, r or z 10 and H 2 <b>antigen</b> <b>complexes,</b> I: 1, 2; 1, 5; 1, 6; 1, 7 or II: e, n, x; e,n,z 15.

Strains 19612 and Negroni cross-reacted and represented a third group. Each strain possessed a major heat-stable <b>antigen</b> <b>complex</b> of 0. 32 mobility characterized by a faster-moving component of 0. 55 mobility.

A predominant cross-reactive band with an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa was detected in extracts of nondisrupted whole M. leprae and in soluble fractions prepared from the tissues of M. leprae-infected armadillos.

Absorption of anti-G 9 B IgG with Adh- and G 9 B barbital extracts showed a correlation between the loss of the 80 - and 52 -kDa antibodies and the loss of adhesion-inhibitory activity. An antibody prepared against the 80 -kDa antigen excised from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels recognized the 80 - and 52 -kDa antigens and another antigen of 62 kDa but did not inhibit adhesion. However, an antibody from an electroblot containing the native protein from which the 80 -kDa and related antigens were derived (the 80 -kDa <b>antigen</b> <b>complex)</b> inhibited adhesion to the same extent as anti-G 9 B IgG. Periodate oxidation of the G 9 B barbital extract modified the 80 -kDa <b>antigen</b> <b>complex</b> and resulted in the loss of 40 % of its absorbing activity. The barbital extract also contained an endogenous enzyme responsible for producing the 62 - and 52 -kDa antigens from the 80 -kDa protein and which, under optimal conditions, degraded the antigen completely, resulting in the loss of antibody-absorbing activity. The 80 -kDa <b>antigen</b> <b>complex</b> has a molecular mass of more than 200 kDa in native polyacrylamide gels and a pI of 4. 1 to 4. 8.

The activity of the cell-free homogenate was retained in its RNA fraction isolated {{by means of the}} phenol method. No antibody formation occurred if such RNA was treated with RNAase. On sucrose gradients (5 to 20 per cent), the active RNA was found to be present in the top third layer.

50|$|The {{mechanism}} by which protective autoimmunity maintains the brain’s functional integrity under non-injurious conditions is still not known. One model suggests that CNS-specific autoimmune T cells which constantly circulate through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) interact with perivascular dendritic cells that reside at the choroid plexus and meninges. Cytokines and growth factors secreted into the CSF by the T cells and dendritic cells then diffuse into the neural parenchyma were they locally affect neurons, glial cells and stem cells. This model infers {{that the level of}} antigen presentation (i.e. the amount of MHC-II-self <b>antigen</b> <b>complexes)</b> serves as an indicator of the level of immune activity required for maintenance of the uninjured brain.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Because {{the gene}} {{expression}} patterns of nonobese hepatic steatosis in affected patients remain unclear, {{we sought to}} explore these patterns using an animal model of nonobese hepatic steatosis. Methods We developed mice that conditionally express the hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein regulated by the tetracycline transactivator (tTA). Microarray analyses and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction were performed using liver samples of both the double transgenic mice (DTM), which express both the HCV core and tTA, and single transgenic mice (STM), which express tTA alone, at 2 months of age. Functional categories of genes with altered expression were classified using gene ontology programs. Serum glucose, lipid levels, and systemic blood pressure were also measured. Results Approximately 20 – 30 % of hepatocytes from the DTM were steatotic. No significant differences were observed in the serum glucose, lipid content, or blood pressure levels between the DTM and STM. Gene expression analyses revealed Sterol-regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) pathway activation and dysregulation of the following genes involved in lipid metabolism: 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase 1, Apolipoprotein AII, Apolipoprotein CI, acyl-CoA thioesterase I, and fatty acid binding protein 1; in mitochondrial function: solute carrier family 25 member 25 and cytochrome c oxidase subunit II; in immune reaction: complement component 3, lymphocyte <b>antigen</b> 6 <b>complex,</b> locus A, lymphocyte <b>antigen</b> 6 <b>complex,</b> locus C, lymphocyte <b>antigen</b> 6 <b>complex,</b> locus D, and lymphocyte <b>antigen</b> 6 <b>complex,</b> locus E. Conclusion Some genes of lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, and immune reaction and the SREBP pathway are involved in HCV core-related, nonobese, modest hepatic steatosis. </p...|$|R
