We introduce {{a modified version of the}} number bisection task, with sequential stimulus presentation, which allows for a systematic examination of mathematical skills in deaf individuals in different modalities (number signs in streaming video vs. <b>Arabic</b> <b>digit</b> displays).

Thirty-four 5 -year-old children participated in the study. Children’s early performance on symbolic and non-symbolic numerical tasks was considered to determine which was a better predictor of NLT performance. Children completed an early number competence standardized test comprising symbolic semantic tasks (<b>Arabic</b> <b>digit</b> comparison and <b>Arabic</b> <b>digit</b> linear order), lexical tasks (numbers recognition and numbers reading), and non-symbolic semantic tasks (dots comparison and picture linear order), and the NLT 0 – 100. The relationship between early number competence (both symbolic and non-symbolic) and performance on the NLT was analyzed using a regression model in which the predictors were identified through a forward selection based {{on the use of the}} index BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion). Results show that symbolic number knowledge tasks (Arabic linear digits order and Arabic digits comparison) are the best predictors of performance on the NLT. This suggests that knowledge of the semantics of Arabic digits is more important than non-symbolic quantity knowledge in predicting number line task accuracy among young children.

40|$|Abstract—Echo state network (ESN) is a {{relatively}} recent type of recurrent neural network that has proved to achieve stateof-the-art performance {{in a variety of}} machine-learning tasks. This robust performance that incorporates the simplicity of ESN implementation has led to wide adoption in the machine-learning community. ESN’s simplicity stems from the weights of the recurrent nodes being assigned randomly, known as the reservoir, and weights are only learnt in the output layer using a linear read-out function. In this paper, we present a novel approach that combines ESN with support vector machines (SVMs) for time series classification by replacing the linear read-out function in the output layer with SVMs with the radial basis function kernel.

Results showed that children from 5 years onwards accessed magnitude information implicitly and explicitly, but that 5 -year-olds failed to access magnitude information explicitly when numerical magnitude was contrasted with physical magnitude. Performance across tasks revealed a clear developmental trajectory: children traverse from first knowing the cardinal values of number words to recognizing Arabic digits to knowing their cardinal values and, concurrently, their ordinal position.

40|$|Earlier {{research}} with monolinguals and bilinguals showed that numbers may be named through both a semantic and a phonological route, {{depending on the}} number's language and format (Arabic or verbal), task demands, and naming language. The present study investigated {{the importance of the}} semantic route for the processing of a third representation of magnitude, namely Roman digits. Using an interference paradigm, we showed that the processing of Roman target digits is influenced by <b>Arabic</b> <b>digit</b> distractors, both in a naming task and a parity judgment task. Roman digits were processed faster if the target and distractor were of the same magnitude. If this was not the case, processing speed slowed down as the numerical distance between target and distractor increased. This strongly suggests that semantic access is mandatory when naming Roman digits. Implications are discussed for the number processing domain and for models of translation in bilinguals.

Yet, adult speakers produce such expressions {{on a regular basis}} in everyday communication. Thus, no theory on numerical cognition or speech production is complete without an account of the production of multi-morphemic utterances such as complex numeral expressions. The main question of this thesis is which particular speech planning levels are involved in the naming and reading of complex numerals for time and space. More specifically, this issue was investigated by examining different modes of response (clock times versus house numbers), alternative input formats (<b>Arabic</b> <b>digit</b> versus alphabetic format; analog versus digital clock displays), and different expression types (relative 'quarter to four' versus absolute 'three forty-five' time expressions) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{semantic}} and non-semantic conversion routes for numerals is still debated in numerical cognition.

The results reveal a semantically related distance effect: Latencies are fastest when the prime has the same value as the target and increase when the distance between prime and target increases. We argue that the present results are congruent {{with the idea that}} the numerals make access to an ordered semantic number line common to all notations, as the results are the same for within-notation priming (arabic–arabic or verbal– verbal) and between-notations priming (arabic–verbal or verbal–arabic).
