40|$|Hemoglobin-mediated lipid {{oxidation}} in washed, minced cod muscle {{was related}} to the triacylglycerol to membrane lipid ratio. The same rapid development of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and painty odor occurred with and without the presence of up to 15 % menhaden oil. Without hemoglobin, development of TBARS and painty odor was slow, despite a high amount of hydroperoxides in samples with <b>oil</b> <b>added</b> (1135 μmol/kg muscle). This suggested that hemoglobin reacted by cleaving preformed hydroperoxides into secondary oxidation products. Nearly doubling the hemoglobin concentration approximately doubled the extent of lipid oxidation with and without <b>added</b> <b>oil.</b> This indicated that hemoglobin was limiting for the oxidation reaction. The noneffect of <b>added</b> <b>oil</b> suggests that membrane lipids and/or preformed membrane lipid hydroperoxides provided sufficient substrate in hemoglobin-catalyzed oxidation of washed minced cod muscle.

50|$|After much experimentation, Daniels had {{designed}} {{a new type}} of watch escapement by 1974. The mechanism, which was first unveiled in 1976 and patented in 1980, was called the coaxial escapement. Its design avoided the need to <b>add</b> <b>oil</b> to the escapement because the mechanism operated with very low friction. Traditional escapements had to use lubricants but this eventually caused problems with accuracy as oil thickened over time. But coaxial escapement used radial friction instead of sliding friction making lubricants unnecessary. Daniels' mechanism has since been described as the most important development in horology in the past 250 years.|$|E

The study was a randomised, cross-over trial of ten American women. The subjects consumed three different porridges separated by 2 week washout periods. Treatment meals (containing 100 g cassava) included: biofortified cassava (2 mg β-carotene) porridge with <b>added</b> <b>oil</b> (15 ml peanut or rapeseed oil, 20 g total fat); biofortified cassava porridge without <b>added</b> <b>oil</b> (6 g total fat); unfortified white cassava porridge with a 0 · 3 mg retinyl palmitate reference dose and <b>added</b> <b>oil</b> (20 g total fat). Blood was collected six times from 20 · 5 to 9 · 5 h post-feeding. TAG-rich lipoprotein (TRL) plasma was separated by ultracentrifugation and analysed using HPLC with coulometric array electrochemical detection. The AUC for retinyl palmitate increased after the biofortified cassava meals were fed (P, 0 · 05).

It was later sold to Don Yenko, who did win several races. In typical Yunick fashion, the car, although superficially a stock Camaro, had acid-dipped body panels and thinner window glass to reduce weight, {{the front end of}} the body tilted downwards and the windshield laid back for aerodynamics, all four fenders widened, the front subframe Z'ed (to physically move the front suspension higher and lower the front of the car) and the floorpan moved up to lower the car, and many other detailed modifications. The drip rails were even brought closer to the body for a tiny aerodynamic improvement. A connector to the engine oil system was extended into the car's interior, to allow the driver to <b>add</b> <b>oil</b> from a pressurized hose during pit stops. In order to allow the driver enough freedom of movement, the shoulder harness was modified to include a cable-ratchet mechanism from a military helicopter.

With nominal price rigidities and full exchange rate pass-through positive oil price shocks depreciate the currency of the oil importing country. The subsequent negative wealth effect adds to the recessive effect of the supply channel and may trongly reduce the consumption in the oil importing country economy. Without exchange rate pass-through oil shocks transmit to the economy only through the supply channel. The model suggests that a change in the exchange rate pass-through might contribute to explain the evidence of a weaker impact of oil price shocks on the macroeconomic activity in recent times. oil price shocks, macroeconomic interdependence, exchange rate pass-through, propagation, transmission...|$|E

Very satisfactory results have been obtained, as far as fuel consumption and unburned hydrocarbons in the exhaust gas are concerned. Large reductions in fuel consumption and in unburned hydrocarbons have been made possible, because the injection timing causes all the injected gasoline to remain in the combustion chamber, and thus {{to take part in the}} combustion process. Moreover, a force-feed lubrication system, like those usually exploited in mass-produced 4 -stroke engines, has been employed, because of the presence of an external pump.

Biol Chem* 275 : 25494 - 25501. ### Reagents: ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") ### Protocol: Prepare: - shaking waterbath 37 °C - Thaw isolation buffer and add collagenase (1. 5 mg/ml) (Collagenase A, B&M; Roche, catalog # 103 578) vortex - Sterile PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) - Reserve tissue culture hood - Warm up primary cell culture medium (which includes 20 mM HEPES and 20 % FBS) 1. Remove interscapular brown fat pad from mice (age late fetal to post natal day 2) - Dissect and mince tissue on parafilm with 500 ul PBS (sterile), use sterile pipette tips, indent parafilm in center so PBS will stay in the center. - Pipette tissue into 500 ul collagenase solution in Eppendorf vials (total volume now about 1000 ul). - Vortex for 10 seconds. - Put Eppendorf vials into shaking waterbath at 90 cycles/minutes (use plastic box and red weights) for 30 seconds and vortex for 10 seconds every 5 minutes - digestion should not exceed 40 minutes. - Filter digested tissue through 100 um filters (LABCOR PRODUCTS, INC. P. O. Box 7277, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20898 - 7277, catalog # 30 - 1, Sterile Nytex Membrane Filter, 38 x 38 mm, 100 Micron, 50 /pkg, Individually Wrapped, order from: PGC Scientific, 7311 Governors Way, Frederick, Maryland 21704, 800 - 424 - 3300, catalog # 358 - 201) into fresh, autoclaved Eppendorf vials. - Centrifuge Eppendorf vials at RT at 1500 rpm (Eppendorf centrifuge) for 5 minutes. - During centrifugation add 2 ml pre-warmed culture medium to 12 well plates. - Remove supernatant (use 1 ml automatic pipette). - Re-suspend pellet in 1 ml culture medium per sample (use 1 ml automatic pipette) and transfer into a 12 well plate. - Leave cells overnight to get plated (day 1). - Next day: wash cells with 3 mls culture medium and add 3 mls fresh culture medium (day 2). (N. B. Cells are sensitive to cold and aspirating therefore hand aspirate.) ### 2.) IMMORTALIZING BROWN FAT CELLS- ESTABLISHING CELL LINES After cells are plated overnight, (day 1), next day wash cells (day 2), on day 3 need to add virus (pBabe SV 40 Large T antigen puromycin). *(preparation of viral stock see protocol 3) * To each well add: VIRUS SOLUTION which consists of: 1) 50 % primary culture media, 2) 50 % viral stock, 3) 1 X polybreen- 8 mg/ml stock solution dissolved in ddH 2 O- final conc. 4 ug/ml(1 : 2000 dilution) (hexadimethrine bromide, Sigma, catalog # H- 9268) 1), 2), 3), should add up to approximately 0. 9 ml/well. For example: if there are 6 wells with cells to be immortalized you need 6 (X) (0. 9 ml) = 5. 4 ml total volume containing primary culture media, viral stock and polybreen. Thus, take 2. 7 mls of primary culture media, 2. 7 mls of viral stock, and 2. 7 ul of polybreen stock, mix by pipetting, filter sterile using a 0. 45 micron filter. Then, for each well, pipette off media, DO NOT USE VACUUM (vacuum will disrupt cells too much), rinse well with 2 mls pre-warmed primary culture media, pipette off rinsing media and add VIRUS SOLUTION VERY SLOWLY!!!!!!! NEXT DAY: split cells into 15 cm dishes - pipette off VIRUS SOLUTION - rinse well with 2 mls DMEM - high (without FBS) - pipette off, put in ≅ 0. 2 ml trypsin for ≅ 3 minutes (until cells just come off plate) - add 2 mls primary culture media, transfer to 15 cm dish containing 25 mls primary culture media. TWO DAYS LATER: start puromycin (Sigma, catalog # P 8833) selection (2 ug/ml puromycin into DMEM high (+) 20 % FBS). Leave in puromycin media for one week. (At this point some cells can be split off to differentiate or do some experiments with.) After puromycin selection cells need {{to be put into}} media directed against *mycoplasma* *infection* (BM Cyclin, Boehringer Mannheim, catalog # 799 050). This will take approximately 2 - 3 weeks.

SV 40 LARGE T ANTIGEN VIRUS PRODUCTION Pharmacia’s Cell Phect protocol with slight modifications (Cell Phect Transfection Kit, Pharmacia Biotech, Cat. # 27 - 9268 - 01) -Grow φNX Cells (see below) in 15 cm plates, 50 - 70 % confluent 4 pm evening 1. Dissolve 15 ug of SV 40 T-pBabe-puro in 480 ul distilled water. - Add 480 ul buffer A - Vortex briefly and incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature. - Add 960 ul buffer B with blue pipette tip {{while at the same time}} you are “bubbling” the solution with an automatic pipette. - Incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature. - Add the precipitate to the φ cell culture (in 15 cm plates, 50 - 70 % confluent) as evenly as possible and support distribution by rotating the dish in a figure eight configuration a few times. Next morning (i. e. 10 a. m.) : 1. Aspirate the medium and rinse the cells CAREFULLY with 25 mls ROOM TEMPERATURE DMEM-H (no FBS) twice. - Add 25 mls ROOM TEMPERATURE DMEM-H + 10 % FBS to the cells. Same day (i. e. 4 pm.) : 1. Change the medium to 25 mls fresh ROOM TEMPERATURE DMEM-H + 10 % FBS. Next evening (24 hours later, i. e. 4 pm.) : First viral harvest: 1. Aspirate supernatant with a 50 cc sterile syringe + 18 G sterile needle. - Remove needle and put 0. 45 micron filter in front of the syringe. - Press the supernatant through the filter into a 50 ml blue top tube. - Add polybrene (4 ug per ml) to the supernatant and mix. - Freeze 1 ml aliquots in sterile freezing vials and store in (-) 80 °C freezer. - Add 25 mls fresh ROOM TEMPERATURE DMEM-H + 10 % FBS to the φ cells. Next evening (24 hours later, i. e. 4 pm.) : Second harvest exactly like the first one. **NOTES ON HANDLING φ NX CELLS** 1. The cells are grown in DMEM-High + 10 % FBS at 5 % CO 2. - The cells grow rapidly. - The cells come off of the dish very easily so be careful when washing/feeding them. - The cells are frozen in 90 % FBS + 10 % DMSO (dimethly sulfoxide) - It is recommended that the cells are not allowed to reach confluence and that they are periodically grown in selection media to maintain their retroviral packaging “goodies”. **φNX Cell Selection Media** DMEM-High + 10 % FBS + 300 ug/ml Hygromycin B + 1 ug/ml Diptheria Toxin A The cells will round up some, they don’t look very good but it’s OK. The cells need to be in selection only about 4 - 7 days, then place themback into regular media and allow them to “recover” to their normal morphology before using and/or freezing them.

(while trypsinizing label other plates/dishes) - (leave cells alone while trypsinizing- this seems to help avoid cells from clumping) **Preparation for “Splitting” Plates** - decide what kind and how many plates are needed: ie: - 6 well plate- gets 4 mls differentiation media plus 12 drops of cells - 12 well plate: gets 2 mls differentiation media - 10 cm dish- gets 8 mls Differentiation media (+) 3 ml cells- usually can get 2 - 4 mg protein - 15 cm dish- Master plate – ALWAYS gets 25 mls DMEM high (+) 10 % FBS **After labelling plates:** - Take out trypsinized Master Plate - Add 25 mls DMEM high (+) 10 % FBS, pipette up and down three times to disperse cells and break up clumps - add - 1 ml to Master plate, - 12 drops into 4 mls differentiation media- 6 well plate, - 3 mls cells into 8 mls differentiation media- 10 cm. Dish - while plating out one cell type-others can remain in trypsin in the hood - when done “splitting” cells take Master plate and 10 cm dish and “distribute” cells evenly by moving dishes in a “figure eight” configuration ten times (for 6 well plates use a “faster” figure eight) FREEZING CELLS- freeze cells in DMEM high (+) 20 % FBS (+) 10 % DMSO ![Table 2]([URL] "Table 2 ") INDUCTION MEDIA - when cells are confluent - prepare fresh – use only on the day you need it - Aspirate off differentiation media and add induction media- no rinsing - 11 mls per plate - For 200 mls Media: add 200 mls Differentiation media to top of 500 ml filter bottle add: 1. 0. 125 M indomethacin (1000 X) - 200 ul (Sigma, catalog # I- 7378) - 2 mg/ml dexamethasone-vortex (1000 X) - 200 ul (Sigma, catalog # D- 1756) - 0. 25 M IBMX (500 X) - 400 ul-(Sigma, catalog # I- 5879) must add immediately after thawing - thaw - vortex - add back to heating block - all three are dissolved in 100 % ethanol and stored frozen in (-) 20 freezer - 1) and 3) must be heated to 75 °C (use heating block) ### 5.)

Rinse plates with PBS - Fix cells by covering with PBS + 10 % formaldehyde or with commercially available buffered formalin (Sigma, catalog # HT 50 - 1 - 640) - Let plates sit at least 15 min. or as long as overnight, at room temperature, alternatively plates can be left @ 4 °C until multiple plates are collected. - Prepare Oil Red O working solution (make fresh each time, as working solution is unstable) by adding 6 ml stock to 4 ml ddH 20. Mix and filter through Whatman # 1 filter paper. (The filtration step takes awhile; it is not advisable to hasten the process by applying a vacuum because there is too much stuff to filter out.) Make about 5 ml per 10 cm plate to be stained. - Remove fixation agent, <b>add</b> <b>Oil</b> Red O stain. - Sit 1 hour (or longer) at room temperature. - Rinse several times, carefully, with distilled water to remove excess stain and any precipitate that forms. - Maintain dishes in water if intact cells are desired. - Pour off distilled water and allow dishes to air dry. - Scan plate...|$|E

The purpose is to create the geological-mathematical methods of efficiency determination of oil-field flooding and to predict the <b>added</b> <b>oil</b> production {{at the expense of}} this process. The geological-mathematical methods of efficiency determination of oil-field flooding, the classified simulators for the prediction of <b>added</b> <b>oil</b> production bodies at the field flooding have been suggested. The immediate oil-fields of Azerbaijan for the introduction of flooding modifications with the prediction assessment presentation of their efficiency have been marked out. The geological-mathematical simulation methods for the determination and for the prediction of efficiency of pool flooding, which have been suggested in the study, allow to assess its efficiency under the geological-process conditions reliablely and to control the production process of oil-fields timely.
