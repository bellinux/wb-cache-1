5|$|In {{the months}} {{immediately}} following the 1930 renumbering, NY14 was routed on Pennsylvania Avenue and South Main Street through southern Elmira. By 1935, NY14 was rerouted to follow Pennsylvania Avenue into downtown. As a result, all of NY17D north of the junction of Pennsylvania <b>and</b> <b>Maple</b> avenues became concurrent with NY14. The overlap was eliminated in the early 1940s when NY17D was pulled back to the intersection of Pennsylvania <b>and</b> <b>Maple</b> avenues and renumbered as NY427.|$|E
5|$|Maple syrup <b>and</b> <b>maple</b> sugar {{were used}} during the American Civil War and by abolitionists {{in the years before}} the war because most cane sugar and {{molasses}} were produced by Southern slaves. Because of food rationing during the Second World War, people in the northeastern United States were encouraged to stretch their sugar rations by sweetening foods with maple syrup <b>and</b> <b>maple</b> sugar, and recipe books were printed to help housewives employ this alternative source.|$|E

5|$|Various woods {{differ in}} their {{susceptibility}} to termite attack; the differences are attributed to such factors as moisture content, hardness, and resin and lignin content. In one study, the drywood termite Cryptotermes brevis strongly preferred poplar <b>and</b> <b>maple</b> woods to other woods that were generally rejected by the termite colony. These preferences may in part have represented conditioned or learned behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Following Suter's {{return from}} suspension, NHL Senior Vice President Brian Burke was {{supposed}} by Ducks Head Coach Pierre Pagé {{to have said}} that he would have given Suter a longer ban if the extent of Kariya's injuries were immediately known. Later in the season, prior to a game between the Blackhawks <b>and</b> <b>Maple</b> Leafs in April 1998, Suter received a death threat, presumably for his actions against Kariya, forcing the NHL to position added security at the Blackhawks bench for the contest. With Kariya away from the team for extended periods of time, the Ducks struggled and finished second-last in the West.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route32, an {{unsigned}} legislative route {{extending from}} North Lawrence to Ogdensburg via Winthrop and Massena. It entered Massena {{on what is}} now NY420 and followed Main Street <b>and</b> <b>Maple</b> Street through the village. West of Massena, the highway was routed on Town Line Road and River Road to a junction east of Waddington, where Route32 continued west on modern NY37 to Waddington.

5|$|In the mid-1990s, {{about one}} percent of the total {{vegetation}} in the park consisted of grasses, bracken, thistle, and fireweed in sections of the forest cleared two to five years earlier. Another two percent had reached the shrub stage, between three and thirty years old, with small trees dominated by such plants as thimbleberry, salmonberry, and blackberry. Forest areas 10 to 30years old that contained tall alder <b>and</b> <b>maple</b> trees and smaller conifers accounted for about 20percent of the park.|$|E

These home grown foods are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays; Thanksgiving, when some Americans make traditional foods to celebrate the occasion.|$|E

The Pennsylvania American Water Company owns all four lakes and several hundred acres of the surrounding land. There are flood levees {{at the mouth of}} the stream. There is some evidence of coal mining on a ridge overlooking the area in the stream's vicinity. However, residential encroachment on the stream's floodplain is a more significant environmental concern.|$|E
