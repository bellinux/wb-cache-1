40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} a weekly email based board review course on individual resident performance on the American Board of Pediatrics (ABP) General Pediatrics Certifying Examination for pediatric residents and, specifically, residents with low ABP In-training Examination (ITE) scores. Methods: Weekly board-type questions were emailed to all pediatric residents from 2004 2007. Responses to board-type questions were tracked, recorded, and correlated with ITE scores and ABP General Pediatrics Certifying Examination Scores. Results: With regard to total number of questions answered, only total number of questions answered correctly had a significant positive correlation with standard board scores (n 71, r 0. 24, p 0. 047). For ‘‘at risk’ ’ residents with ITE scores 5200 (n 21), number of questions answered in PL 3 year (r 0. 51, p 0. 018) and number of questions answered correctly for all PL years (r 0. 59, p 0. 005) had significant positive correlations with standard board scores. Conclusions: Participating regularly in the email-based board review course, <b>answering</b> <b>board</b> style questions, and answering correctly to board style questions were associated with higher standard board scores. This benefit existed for all but was especially prominent among those with poor in-training examination scores...|$|E

Each round begins with a member of each team (in rotation, meaning all players did this at least once) approaching the podium. As the question was read, the first of the two nominees to hit a buzzer gives an answer. If this is not the top answer, the other nominee is asked. The team with the higher answer then chooses whether to [...] "play" [...] the question, or [...] "pass" [...] control to the other team (in reality, the teams rarely chose to pass). The host then passes down the line of the controlling team, asking for an answer from each. After each <b>answer,</b> the <b>board</b> reveals whether this answer featured.

40|$|Our {{study was}} {{interested}} in the exceptionally long protocols, superior to 55 answers, supplied by five subjects in the test of Rorschach according to the method of the Comprehensive System. In order to gain understanding of which attitude to adopt in front of this kind of protocol, we made a a posteriori reduction of the number of answers by basing us on the recommendations of Exner (Exner, on 2001), then a comparative study between the clinical interpretation realized with all of the answers and with only the first five <b>answers</b> by <b>board.</b> We also replicate this methodology of a posteriori decrease of the number of answers with four <b>answers</b> by <b>board</b> according to the new recommendations of the system R-PAS of Meyer and al. (Meyer and al, on 2009). The sample consists of three raw coal subjects and two psychiatric subjects. Our analysis highlighted a stability of certain variables (EB, Lambda, EA for example) but a difference in the psychological profile of the subjects after reduction. We observed a clarification of the fundamental difficulties to the psychiatric subjects and rather a neutralization of these difficulties for the raw coal subjects, with particularly defence mechanisms which seem more adapted. In our sample, the consideration of all of the answers or only of the partial protocol thus brings a difference in the clinical interpretation; as a consequence any reduction should be made with big caution. Our study allows to discuss current practices of the test of Rorschach, by looking for a compromise between the inherent constraints to the validity of the test and the questions of the clinical complexity decrease appropriate to any initiative of standardization.

25|$|After {{the first}} {{contestant}} has either answered all five questions or {{run out of}} time, the host reveals {{how many people in}} the survey matched each of his/her <b>answers.</b> The <b>board</b> is then cleared except for the total score, and the second contestant is then brought out to answer the same five questions. The same rules are followed, but the time limit is extended by five seconds (originally 20, then extended to 25); in addition, if the second contestant duplicates an answer given by the first, a buzzer sounds and he/she must give another answer. If the two contestants reach a combined total of 200 points or more, the family wins the bonus. If not, they are given $5 per point scored as a consolation prize.|$|R
