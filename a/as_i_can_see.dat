25|$|Some {{languages}} have {{a distinct}} grammatical category of evidentiality {{that is required}} to be expressed at all times. The elements in European languages indicating the information source are optional and usually do not indicate evidentiality as their primary function — thus they do not form a grammatical category. The obligatory elements of grammatical evidentiality systems may be translated into English, variously, as I hear that, I see that, I think that, as I hear, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> as far as I understand, they say, it is said, it seems, {{it seems to me}} that, it looks like, it appears that, it turns out that, alleged, stated, allegedly, reportedly, obviously, etc.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{you have}} secret incriminating {{evidence}} against Furtwängler supporting your accusation {{that he was}} a tool of Nazi Party, I beg to take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one's own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military man, you would know that remaining at one's post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtwängler a scapegoat for our own crimes. If the man is guilty of specific crimes, accuse him and convict him. As far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> it is no punishment to be banned from sordid, filthy Berlin and if the man now old and ill is willing and anxious to return to his exacting task and responsibilities he should be encouraged for that is where he belongs, right in Berlin...|$|E
500|$|During Casino Royale's {{final draft}} stages, Fleming allowed his friend William Plomer {{to see a}} copy, and remarked [...] "so far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> the element of {{suspense}} is completely absent". Despite this, Plomer thought the book had sufficient promise and sent a copy to the publishing house Jonathan Cape. At first, they were unenthusiastic about the novel, but Fleming's brother Peter, whose books they managed, persuaded the company to publish it. On 13 April 1953 Casino Royale was released in the UK in hardcover, priced at 10s 6d, with a cover designed by Fleming. It was a success and three print runs were needed {{to cope with the}} demand.|$|E

'High time, too,' say the {{impatient}} audience, {{and with}} this I must agree; for, looking from my tent <b>as</b> <b>I</b> write, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> the smoke-puff bulging on Bulwana Hill as 'Long Tom' toils through his seventy-second day of bombardment, and the white wisp seems to beckon the relieving army onward.|$|R

500|$|To this end, Welensky {{organised}} {{a conference}} in February 1949 to investigate {{the idea of a}} federation. Held at the Victoria Falls Hotel (a common venue for Rhodesian political conferences), representatives from the Northern and Southern Rhodesian Governments were present, but native Africans and the British Government were not. It was agreed that continued pushes for amalgamation would fail, with both the British and native Africans opposed. Welensky suggested that the Constitution of Australia be used as a basis for the proposed federal constitution, and pushed the idea of 'partnership' between blacks and whites. However, he insisted that [...] "for as long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> in that partnership [...] will be senior partners".|$|E

It is clear that he is not quite at ease about him, tho' as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> determined not to abandon him. ... The combat in his mind between the candid interpretation of his friend's actions, and his own conviction deprives him of half the benefit of his understanding.|$|E

50|$|It {{is common}} to use can with verbs of {{perception}} such as see, hear, etc., <b>as</b> in <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> a tree. Aspectual distinctions can be made, such <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could see it (ongoing state) vs. I saw it (event). <b>See</b> <b>can</b> <b>see.</b>|$|R

2500|$|As far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> {{there is}} no {{difference}} between a firing squad, an electric chair, a gas chamber, or hanging. Death is death and I would interpret the shedding of man's blood in legal executions as a figurative expression which means the taking of life. There {{seems to me to be}} no present significance as to whether an execution is by a firing squad or in some other way. I, of course, deleted my article on [...] "hanging" [...] from the Second Edition of Mormon Doctrine because of the reasoning here mentioned.|$|E
2500|$|Hunter R. Rawlings III, President of the {{prominent}} Association of American Universities research group of universities to which UVA is an elected member, came to Charlottesville {{to make a}} speech to university faculty which included a statement about the proposal: [...] "there's no possibility, as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> that any state will ever relinquish its ownership and governance of its public universities, much less of its flagship research university". He encouraged university leaders to stop talking about privatization and instead push their state lawmakers to increase funding for higher education and research as a public good.|$|E
2500|$|In 873, {{in a grand}} ceremony, Emperor Yizong welcomed {{what was}} {{claimed to be a}} relic (a finger bone) of Gautama Buddha to the palace, despite {{warnings}} by some that his grandfather Emperor Xianzong died shortly after also welcoming the same relic to the palace. [...] (Emperor Yizong responded to the warnings by stating, [...] "As long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> it once while living, I do not have regrets about dying.") [...] The ceremony was said to bring out great offerings by the households of Chang'an. [...] Emperor Yizong himself walked toward the relic and bowed on the ground in tears.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{occasional}} {{claims that}} Sky News may be inherently biased {{due to the}} fact that it is majority-owned by 21st Century Fox; most of 21st Century Fox's (and News Corp, in which Rupert Murdoch also has an ownership interest) news outlets have an openly conservative or right-wing outlook. In a 2010 article in the New Statesman, prominent journalist and broadcaster Mehdi Hasan argued that [...] "in style and in substance, of course, it is nothing like the pro-war, pro-Republican, pro-Palin Fox News Channel... Sky News remains, as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> free of party political bias." ...|$|E
2500|$|Neal Ascherson defended Kapuściński in March 2010 by saying: [...] "None of the doubts, as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> {{are about}} the despatches and {{features}} he sent to newspapers, or to the Polish Press Agency. They are about his books. The adventures and encounters he describes in his books are on a different level of veracity. Like his friend Gabriel García Márquez, Kapuściński {{used to talk about}} [...] "literary reportage". You're meant to believe what you are being told, but not in every literal detail. [...] Scrupulous in his journalism, in his books he was capable of inventing {{in order to make a}} truth even truer. He was a great story-teller, but not a liar." ...|$|E
2500|$|The court debated what [...] "religious worship" [...] meant but {{identified}} the phrase [...] "place of meeting for religious worship" [...] in the 1855 Act {{as being the}} key issue. To Lord Denning's mind, this meant [...] "a place of which the principal use was {{as a place where}} people came together as a congregation to do reverence" [...] to a deity, whether it was the Christian God or some other. The judges agreed that Scientology's practices [...] "did not reveal any form whatever of worship. [...] did not humble themselves in reverence or recognition of the dominant power and control of any entity or being outside their own bodies and life." [...] As Lord Denning put it, [...] "There is considerable stress on the spirit of Man, and adherents of this religion or philosophy believe that a man's spirit is everlasting and moves from one human frame to another. But it is still, as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> the spirit of Man and not God." [...] The court found that {{there was no evidence of}} religious worship taking place in the chapel and dismissed the appeal. Permission to appeal to the House of Lords was refused.|$|E
6000|$|... "Powers of {{observation}} but no curiosity, thank goodness," [...] Lady Elisabeth declared. [...] "Perhaps {{that is just}} <b>as</b> well, for <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> {{that you are going}} to turn out to be a very mysterious person." ...|$|R

2500|$|James Leach of Your Sinclair {{gave the}} ZX Spectrum game a 92/100 rating, writing that [...] "I'm really into this game. As far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see,</b> it's got {{everything}} it should have. It's fast, it's easy in places and dead wicked in others and it's got a {{massive amount of}} variety. What more could you want? ... The graphics are very cartoony, as you'd expect, and there's pots of colour." [...] Leach {{also noted that the}} idea of including minigames in Bart vs. the Space Mutants [...] "is pretty inspired, and makes the game even more fun." [...] A reviewer for Crash also gave the ZX Spectrum version a positive review, with a 91/100 rating. He praised the variety and gameplay of the game, and noted that [...] "while it may sound pretty basic [...] it’s when you start discovering things, making use of objects, finding hidden treasures that it really comes alive. And achieving an objective is satisfying because the route to completion can be pretty tough (especially some of the platform elements)." [...] The reviewer also noted that [...] "if you’re a Simpsons fan the game’s incredibly appealing, the graphics all reflect Matt Groening’s cartoon very well. And how much of a fan you are dictates how much you’re really going to enjoy this [...] Non-fans can still get loads of entertainment, but some parts may be frustrating if you’re not into the characters." ...|$|E
2500|$|The mixtape is {{predominantly}} R/pop; however, JoJo describes the mixtape's sound as genre-less. On the first {{track of the}} tape [...] "Back2thebeginningagain" [...] JoJo talks about her constant record label struggles and how she finally feels okay to record the type of music she has always wanted to. JoJo states [...] "It's about driving around Foxborough in my mom's Toyota Echo with the dents {{on the side of}} it and just getting in touch with my roots: Who I am; where I came from. I'm talking about some of those dark times where I've drank until I've gone to sleep and woken up and feeling like 'ok, everything else is in the past. Today I start forward and start fresh.'" [...] The mixtape's second track [...] "We Get By" [...] is mainly of an old school R/pop genre. It is written by JoJo who expresses remaining optimistic in spite of the obstacles she faces. [...] "I know it will be OK. I believe in myself" [...] she sings, referring to her constant label troubles. JoJo states [...] "It's kind of about me moving from South Boston to Los Angeles and my decision to do that. Feeling like I needed a place to explore and grow." [...] She goes on further in another interview stating [...] "It's the mission statement for {{what we were going to}} expand upon, and I was touching on the feeling like you don't belong anywhere but you still feel like you're going to be okay no matter where you're at." [...] The third track on the tape [...] "Take the Canyon" [...] is influenced by an old relationship. JoJo says [...] "'Take the Canyon' is about cheating, and it's about only having a window of time to be with that lover and needing to get there as soon as possible for this illicit rendezvous. It's about taking the canyon–Beverly Glen or Laurel Canyon or whatever it may be." [...] The fourth track is titled [...] "Billions" [...] and was originally written about an old lover. JoJo states [...] "it became about my family. As much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> in the world, there's nothing more important to me than that foundation of family, friendship and real love." ...|$|E
