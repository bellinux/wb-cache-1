25|$|The chloroplasts {{of plant}} and algal cells can orient {{themselves}} to best suit the available light. In low-light conditions, they will spread out in a sheet—maximizing the surface area to absorb light. Under intense light, they will seek shelter by aligning in vertical columns along the plant cell's cell wall or turning sideways so that light strikes them edge-on. This reduces exposure and protects them from photooxidative damage. This ability to distribute chloroplasts {{so that they can}} take shelter behind each other or spread out may be the reason why land plants evolved to have many small chloroplasts instead of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>big</b> ones.|$|E
