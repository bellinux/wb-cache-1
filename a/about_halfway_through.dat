5|$|Two {{pilots were}} filmed. Fascinated by mathematicians, creators Cheryl Heuton and Nicolas Falacci {{decided to create}} a show about one. With the {{encouragement}} of CBS development executives, they wrote several pilots revolving around mathematicians and scientists, including the pilot for Numb3rs, {{over the course of}} 14 years. Knowing that mathematics would not be readily accepted by the general public on its own, Heuton and Falacci in 2003 decided to use the police procedural format to facilitate the acceptance. When Falacci and Heuton pitched the pilot, CBS agreed to produce it <b>about</b> <b>halfway</b> <b>through</b> their presentation.|$|E
5|$|Ian Smith {{was born}} in 1919, the son of British {{settlers}} in Selukwe, Southern Rhodesia. He attended Chaplin School in Gwelo, where he was head prefect, recipient of the Victor Ludorum in athletics, captain of the school teams in cricket, rugby union and tennis, and successful academically. After graduating in 1937, he attended Rhodes University College in Grahamstown, South Africa, which was often attended by Rhodesian students, partly because Rhodesia then had no university of its own. Enrolling {{at the start of}} 1938, Smith read for a Bachelor of Commerce degree. He was <b>about</b> <b>halfway</b> <b>through</b> his course when the Second World War broke out in September 1939.|$|E

500|$|On September 30, Chandler brought Hendrix to the London Polytechnic at Regent Street, where Cream was {{scheduled}} to perform, and where Hendrix and Eric Clapton met. Clapton later commented: [...] "He {{asked if he could}} play a couple of numbers. I said, 'Of course', but I had a funny feeling <b>about</b> him." [...] <b>Halfway</b> <b>through</b> Cream's set, Hendrix took the stage and performed a frantic version of the Howlin' Wolf song [...] "Killing Floor". In 1989, Clapton described the performance: [...] "He played just about every style you could think of, and not in a flashy way. I mean he did a few of his tricks, like playing with his teeth and behind his back, but it wasn't in an upstaging sense at all, and that was it... He walked off, and my life was never the same again".|$|R
5000|$|Through {{the third}} leg, Sanya Richards held a steady three metre lead over Olesya Zykina, while Nadia Davy {{slightly}} gained on Zykina from behind. Coming onto the final straight, Richards exploded, pulling away as Davy {{pulled to the}} outside to put her move on Zykina. They ran even for half the straightaway before Zykina was able to regain command. [...] Monique Hennagan left with a clear lead for America, the Russians exchanged cleanly with Natalya Antyukh in hot pursuit. But as the Jamaicans exchanged, Sandie Richards ran {{into the back of}} Zykina. As she stopped and sidestepped, she lost several metres and the chance at silver. Hennigan opened up to <b>about</b> 12 meters <b>halfway</b> <b>through</b> the lap, slowing the second half to cross the finish line with just less than a ten-meter advantage in the gold-medal time of 3:19.01.|$|R
5|$|The rain {{continued}} {{throughout the}} second session, so most teams concentrated on their wet weather setups {{in preparation for}} a wet race. <b>About</b> <b>halfway</b> <b>through</b> the session the No. 7 Peugeot in the hands of Marc Gené missed the turn at Arnage and hit a tire barrier. The car was unable to return to the pits and was taken behind the wall by the marshals. This was soon followed by the No. 73 Luc Alphand Corvette missing the same turn as well, but it continued on without significant damage. The No. 70 PSI Corvette had a minor accident in the last five minutes of the session, bringing out the only red flag of the day and ending all of qualifying.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, the Sun's December {{solstice}} position (in {{the northern}} hemisphere, {{the lowest point}} on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of Sagittarius, one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the Milky Way. Every year, on the December solstice, the Sun and the Milky Way, appear (from {{the surface of the}} Earth) to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in the Milky Way. Given that the Milky Way is between 10° and 20° wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to precess through it. In 2012 it was <b>about</b> <b>halfway</b> <b>through</b> the Milky Way, crossing the galactic equator. In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins when}} a young man is seen walking alone {{in a small town}} to the snowy {{football}} fields in a morning winter. A cut-scene shows Swift inside a house wearing a comfy sweater draped over one shoulder. She is brooding and singing about her lost love while wandering morosely around her apartment. She is also seen sitting in the bathtub, missing her boyfriend who she didn't treat well when they were together. <b>About</b> <b>halfway</b> <b>through,</b> it starts to snow inside the spacious house. A montage of Swift writing a letter is shown alternately with scenes of her boyfriend strolling around the town. It is then revealed that the whole situation is the aftermath of a break-up between Swift and her boyfriend. It is also shown that Swift slips the letter that she has written in his coat pocket before he leaves. The final scene shows her ex-boyfriend sitting in the bleachers, reading her apology letter.|$|E
5000|$|Backups on Interstate 71 began {{more than}} eight hours {{before the start of}} the race. By 3:30 pm, I-71 was backed up for more than 15 mi to the north of the speedway. At 6:00 pm, the Kentucky State Police (KSP) {{reported}} backups of more than 20 mi in both directions on I-71, and backups of 10 mi on side roads in the area. The KSP added that traffic was still backed up for miles at <b>about</b> 8:55 pm, <b>halfway</b> <b>through</b> the race. At 9:30 pm, traffic patterns were switched to outbound, and many fans who were still trying to get to the track were turned away. [...] Several fans who managed to make it to the race were turned away because there wasn't enough available parking. [...] Those who made it to the race were only reported having to wait half an hour or more to use the restroom due to a shortage of port-a-johns. Others reported shortages at the concession stands.|$|R
500|$|Corriea {{was mixed}} about the game's HD upgrade, stating {{that while the}} {{background}} were [...] "gorgeous" [...] and the main characters moved fluidly and expressed emotion properly, NPCs or characters unimportant to the stories did not receive the same attention as the main cast. Schilling was disappointed with the result, frequently citing scenery and character behavior that looked out of place on the big screen. Miller said that the game's visuals were [...] "dominated by muddy textures and frequent loading.", while he negatively noted {{the removal of the}} original's multiplayer. Damiani praised the upgrades for the main characters, but noted multiple inconsistencies in both the environments and cutscenes. Famitsu found the graphics [...] "dramatically beautiful", but found it strange seeing the original environments on a large screen. Meyerink said that, while not hard on the eyes, the upgrades were well below what he expected. Sullivan praised the lighting and shading effects, but shared Corriea's criticism of NPCs and noted low-quality environmental textures, saying she was [...] "so bored by most environments that [...] stopped caring <b>about</b> them <b>halfway</b> <b>through</b> the story." [...] The localized dialogue also received mixed to negative reactions, with multiple reviewers faulting the English voice actors' performances. Opinions on the PC port were mixed: Meyerink marked it as an improvement of the ports of the XIII games while acknowledging issues with the graphics and controls, while Roberts was not impressed by its performance.|$|R

5|$|When he played, Bates {{stood at}} , {{something}} that teammates taunted him about: in Milwaukee spring training camp, players threw {{a cap on}} the ground and addressed {{it as if it were}} Bates. During the MLB off-season, he worked as a substitute school teacher in Houston. Before the World Series, Bates raced against an unchained cheetah in a promotional event for the Cincinnati Zoo at Riverfront Stadium. The premise of the event was to show that a cheetah could defeat a human (with a five-second head start) in a 100-yard race. The cheetah was supposed to chase a toy, but <b>about</b> <b>halfway</b> <b>through</b> the race, Bates' hat fell off, and instead, it went after the hat; Bates won the race. In 2000, the University of Texas inducted him into their Men's Athletics Hall of Honor. , Bates lives in Houston and works for an equipment supplier in the oil and gas industry. He also coaches his daughter's softball team outside of work.|$|E
5|$|The Sun is <b>about</b> <b>halfway</b> <b>through</b> its main-sequence stage, {{during which}} nuclear fusion {{reactions}} in its core fuse hydrogen into helium. Each second, {{more than four}} million tonnes of matter are converted into energy within the Sun's core, producing neutrinos and solar radiation. At this rate, the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into energy, about 0.03% of the total mass of the Sun. The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 billion years as a main-sequence star. The Sun is gradually becoming hotter during its time on the main sequence, because the helium atoms in the core occupy less volume than the hydrogen atoms that were fused. The core is therefore shrinking, allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the centre and experience a stronger gravitational force, according to the inverse-square law. This stronger force increases {{the pressure on the}} core, which is resisted by a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs. This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser. It is estimated that the Sun has become 30% brighter in the last 4.5 billion years. At present, it is increasing in brightness by about 1% every 100 million years.|$|E
5|$|The first {{qualifying}} session began {{under the}} threat of rain, {{so most of the}} teams tried to set a good lap time before the conditions deteriorated. The Audis and Peugeots swapped the overall pole position several times, {{and at the end of}} the session the No. 1 Audi was fastest overall with a time of 3.28.301. The No. 33 Barazi-Epsilon Zytek led LMP2, after an earlier misfiring problem had been repaired. Oreca's Saleens were the fastest two GT1 cars, while Ferrari and Porsche were close to one another in GT2. The session was red flagged <b>about</b> <b>halfway</b> <b>through</b> because of an accident in which the No. 53 JLOC Lamborghini Murciélago, driven by Marco Apicella, hit the wall at the first Mulsanne chicane. The No. 25 Ray Mallock Ltd. Lola and No. 81 LNT Panoz were the only cars not to set a lap time before the session briefly returned to green as rain began. The ACO extended the session by fifteen minutes to compensate for the earlier red flag.|$|E

25|$|<b>About</b> <b>halfway</b> <b>through</b> the Permian (in the Kungurian {{age of the}} Permian's Cisuralian epoch), all {{the continents}} joined to form the supercontinent Pangaea, {{surrounded}} by the superocean Panthalassa, although blocks that are now parts of Asia did not join the supercontinent until very late in the Permian. The configuration severely decreased the extent of shallow aquatic environments, the most productive part of the seas, and it exposed formerly isolated organisms of the rich continental shelves to competition from invaders. Pangaea's formation would also have altered both oceanic circulation and atmospheric weather patterns, creating seasonal monsoons near the coasts and an arid climate in the vast continental interior.|$|E
25|$|<b>About</b> <b>halfway</b> <b>through</b> the book, Cochran and Harpending {{pause to}} {{consider}} {{two different ways}} of looking at the information found in gene variants. Researchers commonly see them merely as markers of human migration, ignoring their functions. The authors support such research, but argue for a more complete understanding of the geographic distributions of genes. Where the usual geographical analysis treats the distribution of genes as an effect of history, in the authors' view, the genes themselves are a major cause: Two variants in the same gene do not necessarily have the same effect, and their relative, selective benefits will control the spread of genes through populations in both space and time.|$|E
25|$|Griffin is the surname of the story's protagonist. His {{name is not}} {{mentioned}} until <b>about</b> <b>halfway</b> <b>through</b> the book. Consumed with his greed for power and fame, he is the model of science without humanity. A gifted young student, he becomes interested in the science of refraction. During his experiments, he accidentally discovers chemicals (combined with an unspecified kind of radiation) that would make living tissue invisible. Obsessed with his discovery, he tries the experiment on himself and becomes invisible. However, {{he does not know}} how to reverse the process, and he slowly discovers that the advantages of being invisible do not outweigh the disadvantages and the problems he faces. Thus begins his downfall as he takes the road to crime for his survival, revealing in the process his lack of conscience, inhumanity and complete selfishness. He progresses from obsession to fanaticism, to insanity, and finally to his fateful end.|$|E
