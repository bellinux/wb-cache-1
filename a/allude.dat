5|$|Sheep {{have had}} a strong {{presence}} in many cultures, especially in areas where they form {{the most common type}} of livestock. In the English language, to call someone a sheep or ovine may <b>allude</b> that they are timid and easily led. In contradiction to this image, male sheep are often used as symbols of virility and power; the logos of the Los Angeles Rams football team and the Dodge Ram pickup truck <b>allude</b> to males of the bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis.|$|E

5|$|Mazatec shamans have a {{long and}} {{continuous}} tradition of religious use of Salvia divinorum, using it to facilitate visionary states of consciousness during spiritual healing sessions.

Doomfist's other aesthetic customization options <b>allude</b> to the boxer Muhammad Ali, the combo sequences of fighting video games, and other pop culture references.|$|E

25|$|Eclogue I <b>alludes</b> to many sources. Some {{scholars}} {{think it}} is modelled principally upon Virgil’s Fourth Eclogue, which also heralds a new golden age. Hubbard considers that the poem, particularly {{the description of the}} comet, <b>alludes</b> to Lucan.|$|R
5|$|The brigade {{served in}} Europe during World War II, a fact which was {{included}} on its Distinctive Unit Insignia when the 20th Engineer Brigade received one on 10 February 1966. The {{four corners of}} the crenelated square <b>allude</b> to their four campaigns in World War II, Normandy, Northern France, Rhineland and Central Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel is}} widely cited as an {{important}} early example of the realism for which Balzac became famous. Descriptions of Paris are one example: the novel is filled with actual locations, including the Palais Royal and the Notre Dame Cathedral. The narration and characters <b>allude</b> repeatedly to art and culture, from Gioachino Rossini's opera Tancredi to the statue of Venus de Milo.|$|E
5|$|The {{transition}} to a more radical form of poetry {{seems to have taken}} place in 1913-1915, during the periods when Tzara and Vinea were vacationing together. The pieces share a number of characteristics and subjects, and the two poets even use them to <b>allude</b> to one another (or, in one case, to Tzara's sister).|$|E

5|$|Anderson {{has stated}} that the film's camera angles and several shots <b>allude</b> to the video game's camera angles, such as the fight between Alice and the {{security}} guard. These include a scene near the beginning {{where there is a}} close up of Alice's eye. This is a direct reference to the title screen of the first game. In another scene, Alice awakes and hears a creepy sound, which is a reference to the plot of the first game.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 13th century, a {{primitive}} form of milling the silk threads was already in use. In 1221 Jean de Garlande's dictionary, and in 1226, Étienne Boileau's Livre des métiers (Tradesman's Handbook) enumerated many types of devices which can only have been doubling machines. The instruments used were further perfected in Bologna between 1270 and 1280. From {{the start of}} the 14th century, many documents <b>allude</b> to the use of devices that were quite complex.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of those}} {{involved}} in the revolt used pseudonyms, particularly in the letters sent around the country to encourage support and fresh uprisings. They were used both to avoid incriminating particular individuals and to <b>allude</b> to popular values and stories. One popular assumed name was Piers Plowman, taken from the main character in William Langland's poem. Jack was also a widely used rebel pseudonym, and historians Steven Justice and Carter Revard suggest that this may have been because it resonated with the Jacques of the French Jacquerie revolt several decades earlier.|$|E
5000|$|Barton {{explained}} that the motto <b>alluded</b> to the Eye of Providence: [...] "Deo favente which <b>alludes</b> to the Eye in the Arms, meant for the Eye of Providence." [...] In western art, God is traditionally represented by the Eye of Providence, which principally symbolizes God's omniscience.|$|R

5|$|The Dalek {{ability to}} fly or hover {{dates back to}} The Chase, where a Dalek was implied to have taken flight, while in Revelation of the Daleks, a Dalek hovered to exterminate two victims. The {{first part of the}} 1988 serial Remembrance of the Daleks shows a Dalek who was clearly seen to hover up a flight of stairs to the Doctor's horror. Rose and Adam <b>allude</b> to a long-held fan joke about the Daleks' {{inability}} to climb stairs, and are horrified when it does so.|$|E
5|$|The Roundels Argent {{charged with}} a Cross Gules (white circles with a red cross) <b>allude</b> to the badge of office of Rouge Croix. Planché used his coat of arms on his bookplate, and the crest alone on his writing paper. When he was {{promoted}} to Somerset Herald, Planché surrounded the crest on his writing paper with a collar of Esses. While he was entitled to the collar by his appointment as herald, its inclusion in his armorial bearings was considered somewhat unusual.|$|E
5|$|The {{foreground}} {{figure of}} the older man may be a reference to Ugolino from Dante's Inferno—a subject that Géricault had contemplated painting—and seems to borrow from a painting of Ugolini by Henry Fuseli (1741–1825) that Géricault may have known from prints. In Dante, Ugolino is guilty of cannibalism, {{which was one of}} the most sensational aspects of the days on the raft. Géricault seems to <b>allude</b> to this through the borrowing from Fuseli. An early study for The Raft of the Medusa in watercolour, now in the Louvre, is much more explicit, depicting a figure gnawing on the arm of a headless corpse.|$|E
50|$|H.G. Wells <b>alludes</b> {{to it in}} Tono-Bungay (1909).|$|R
50|$|The album <b>alludes</b> {{to several}} other musical works.|$|R

5|$|Thiruvilaiyadal {{has been}} parodied and {{referenced}} in various media such as cinema, television and theatre.

In {{his review of}} Oru Kanniyum Moonu Kalavaanikalum (2014), Baradwaj Rangan likened the way Shiva plays his divine games by intervening in human affairs in Thiruvilaiyadal {{to the use of}} touchscreen human face icons on mobile apps.|$|E
5|$|Various {{features}} in the print are meant to intensify the feelings of dread: the murder {{takes place in a}} graveyard, said to be St Pancras but suggested by John Ireland to resemble Marylebone; an owl and a bat fly around the scene; the moon shines down on the crime; the clock strikes one {{for the end of the}} witching hour. The composition of the image may <b>allude</b> to Anthony van Dyck's The Arrest of Christ. A lone Good Samaritan appears again: among the snarling faces of Tom's accusers, a single face looks to the heavens in pity.|$|E
5|$|When Captain Scarlet was {{repeated}} by Central Television {{in the latter}} half of the decade, changes were made to the episode's opening sequence to remove dialogue in which the Mysterons <b>allude</b> to surveillance equipment that is being rotated to facilitate inspection of the Martian Exploration Vehicle. Since the imaging device resembles a missile battery (as the Zero X astronauts mistake it for), this re-edited version inadvertently gives an impression of stronger hostility on the part of the Mysterons.|$|E
60|$|Knowing, it is {{needless to}} say, {{that he had}} <b>alluded</b> to Mrs. Lewson, Iris warmly commended him {{for taking care of}} her old nurse. At the same time, she remembered the unfriendly terms in which the {{housekeeper}} had <b>alluded</b> to Lord Harry, when they had talked of him.|$|R
