Horses were vaccinated intramuscularly twice at 3 -week intervals with a vaccine containing antigens from bovine viral respiratory pathogens to avoid interference from maternal antibody. Both groups of foals and <b>adult</b> <b>horses</b> responded to the vaccine with a significant increase in vaccine-specific IgGa and IgG(T) concentrations. In contrast, only <b>adult</b> <b>horses</b> and 3 -month-old foals mounted significant vaccine-specific total IgG, IgGb, and IgM responses.

40|$|Rhodococcus equi is a facultative {{intracellular}} pathogen {{that causes}} pneumonia in foals {{but does not}} induce disease in <b>adult</b> <b>horses.</b> Virulence of R. equi depends {{on the presence of}} a large plasmid, which encodes a family of seven virulence-associated proteins (VapA and VapC to VapH). Eradication of R. equi from the lungs depends on gamma interferon (IFN-γ) production by T lymphocytes. The objectives of the present study were to determine the relative in vivo expression of the vap genes of R. equi in the lungs of infected foals, to determine the recall response of bronchial lymph node (BLN) lymphocytes from foals and <b>adult</b> <b>horses</b> to each of the Vap proteins, and to compare the cytokine profiles of proliferating lymphocytes between foals and <b>adult</b> <b>horses.</b> vapA, vapD, and vapG were preferentially expressed in the lungs of infected foals, and expression of these genes in the lungs was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher than that achieved during in vitro growth.

40|$|BACKGROUND : Equine {{gastric ulcer}} {{syndrome}} (EGUS) {{is common in}} <b>adult</b> <b>horses,</b> particularly those involved in performance disciplines. Currently, detection of EGUS by gastroscopy is the only reliable ante mortem method for definitive diagnosis; however it is unsuitable as a screening test because it is expensive, time consuming, and is not readily available to most veterinarians. Sucrose permeability testing represents a simple, economical alternative to gastroscopy for screening purposes, and the feasibility of this approach in the horse has been previously reported. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of blood sucrose as a screening test for EGUS in a large group of <b>adult</b> <b>horses</b> with and without naturally occurring gastric disease. RESULTS : One hundred and one <b>adult</b> <b>horses</b> with or without naturally occurring gastric ulceration were studied. The diagnostic accuracy of blood sucrose for diagnosis of gastric lesions (GL), glandular lesions (GDL), squamous lesions (SQL), and clinically significant lesions (CSL) at 45 and 90 min after administration of 1 g/kg of sucrose via nasogastric intubation was assessed using receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves and calculating the area under the curve (AUC). For each lesion type, sucrose concentration in blood was compared to gastroscopy, as the gold standard, and sensitivities (Se) and specificities (Sp) were calculated across a range of sucrose concentrations. Ulcer grading was performed blindly by one observer; and the results were validated by comparing them with that of two other observers, and calculating the level of agreement. Cut-off values were selected manually to optimize Se. The prevalence of GL, GDL, SQL, and CSL was 83, 70, 53 and 58 % respectively. At the selected cut-offs, Se ranged from 51 to 79 % and Sp ranged from 43 to 72 %, depending upon the lesion type and time of sampling. CONCLUSIONS : Blood sucrose is neither a sensitive or specific test for detecting EGUS in this population of <b>adult</b> <b>horses</b> with naturally occurring gastric ulceration. Further studies aimed at evaluating the performance characteristics of the test in different study populations are warranted. Given the limitations of endoscopy, due consideration should also be given to alternative methods for comparison of blood sucrose with a gold standard. Additional file 1.
