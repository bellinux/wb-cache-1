5|$|This corvid {{is known}} to join mixed-species flocks with other species {{including}} unicolored jays and emerald toucanets. It is also known to travel in groups with two to ten other <b>azure-hooded</b> <b>jays.</b> It is a skulking and secretive species, rarely coming out into the open. Because of this habit, the bird {{is extremely difficult to}} observe in the wild and not much is known about its ecology. Mates are known to preen each other, a process which entails one bird bending over {{in front of the other}} and tugging on its throat feathers. The feathers of the crown are often moving swiftly, and it is believed that the condition of a mate can be determined by this movement.|$|R

The base of the <b>azure-hooded</b> <b>jay's</b> first studied nest was coarsely made out of twigs that were [...] long.

In addition to building its own nest, this jay is known to reuse old, abandoned nests made by other species. Three to four eggs are normally laid. The young are typically raised in the nest between April and June and they take at least 20days to fledge. Both parents care for the young and feed them a variety of insects, including katydids. After the young fledge, they stay close to their parents.|$|R
