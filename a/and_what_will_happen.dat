She was {{critical}} {{of the amount of}} Epic Scenes (which show clips from the films) in proportion to actual cutscenes; [...] "there's so much exposition being done by Gandalf that it seems to {{come at the expense of}} your characters [...] you are explicitly told what has happened <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen</b> instead of actually seeing it happen, and it serves to somewhat distance the player from the whole experience." [...] However, she praised the graphics and sound, concluding [...] "The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age molds Middle-earth into a traditional turn-based frame, and while the results aren't all that great, the game carries some pretty good features and should appeal to fans of the source material." ...|$|E

2500|$|On October 1, 2008, {{creator of}} the {{original}} Todd and Marty rape storyline, Malone, shared his thoughts with TV Guide about the romance controversy. [...] "On one hand, it surprises me because Ron has been a far more conventional soap writer than I was, [...] "Malone stated. [...] "He’s also a great lover of the form, and {{has worked in the}} form for a long time. Ron loves the conventions and traditions of the form. So, my first reaction is, I’m surprised." [...] Malone said that the character (Marty) having amnesia [...] "literally erases the real moral consequences and the real spiritual journey Marty has embarked on. It’s like telling Othello he’s White and Desdemona doesn’t really die. Presumably, Marty will gain her memory, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>happen?</b> She will be horrified". Malone agreed that Todd had now [...] "raped Marty in the worst possible way" [...] but that this type of story [...] coming out of nowhere". [...] "In this genre, General Hospitals Luke and Laura have a long history. This kind of story is profoundly founded on hope, forgiveness and redemption," [...] he said. [...] "That’s why it goes to its most radical narrative position. That someone can forgive this ultimate crime is redemptive both for the person forgiven, and the forgiver." [...] Malone said he had faith in Carlivati's storytelling but that the story would have been different and possibly not romantic if he himself had been writing it. [...] "Anyone can tell a story, {{and one of the reasons}} people mock soaps is because you can only read plot," [...] he said. [...] "Writing a story is about the depths of the character and the relationships of the character, and the beauty in which the story is told." ...|$|E
