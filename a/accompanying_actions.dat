But a word {{distinguished}} here and there, and <b>accompanying</b> <b>actions,</b> made transparent the meaning of their presence and argument. The big man refused to ride any farther. Evidently he had come so far without realizing it. His importunities were for [...] "more head of stock." [...] His scorn was for a [...] "measly little bunch not worth the risk." [...] His anger was for Belllounds's foolhardiness in [...] "leavin' a trail." [...] Belllounds had little to say, and most of that was spoken in a tone too low to be heard. His manner seemed indifferent, even reckless. But he wanted [...] "money." [...] The scar-faced man's name was [...] "Smith." [...] Then Columbine gathered from Smith's dogged and forceful gestures, and his words, [...] "no money" [...] and [...] "bigger bunch," [...] that he was unwilling to pay what had been agreed upon unless Belllounds promised to bring {{a larger number of}} cattle. Here Belllounds roundly cursed the rustler, and apparently argued that course [...] "next to impossible." [...] Smith made a sweeping movement with his arm, pointing south, indicating some place afar, and part of his speech was [...] "Gore Peak." [...] The little man, companion of Smith, got into the argument, and, dismounting from his horse, he made marks upon the smooth earth of the trail. He was drawing a rude map showing direction and locality. At length, when Belllounds nodded as if convinced or now informed, this third member of the party remounted, and seemed to have no more to say. Belllounds pondered sullenly. He snatched a switch from off a bough overhead and flicked his boot and stirrup with it, an action that made his horse restive. Smith leered and spoke derisively, of which speech Columbine heard, [...] "Aw hell!" [...] and [...] "yellow streak," [...] and [...] "no one'd ever," [...] and [...] "son of Bill Belllounds," [...] and [...] "rustlin' stock." [...] Then this scar-faced man drew out a buckskin bag. Either the contempt or the gold, or both, overbalanced vacillation in the weak mind of Jack Belllounds, for he lifted his head, showing his face pale and malignant, and without trace of shame or compunction he snatched the bag of gold, shouted a hoarse, [...] "All right, damn you!"

This study was action research consisting of two cycles and used a qualitative method. The researcher worked collaboratively with the English teacher, the collaborator, and the students. The participants of this research were 21 students of class XI IPA 2 at MAN Wonosari, Gunungkidul, in the academic year of 2012 / 2013. The data of this study were qualitative. The qualitative data were obtained by observing the teaching and learning process during the implementation of the actions and interviewing the students, the English teacher and the collaborator about the implemented actions.

However, the communicative tasks which were implemented through group work in retelling story were not successful because there were some students who were not actively engaged in the tasks/ activities. Therefore, the researcher improved that action by giving each student a different responsibility to finish the task.

It involved the researcher, English teacher, and students. The participants of this research were 35 students of VIII D class of MTs N 1 Mlati in the academic year of 2012 / 2013. The data were collected through observation and interview the students of grade VIIID and the English teacher. The data were in form of field note, interview transcript, and pictures. The research instruments for collecting data were interview guidelines and a camera. To overcome the problems, some actions were implemented such as group work activity, role-play, discussion, and storytelling and also some <b>accompanying</b> <b>actions</b> (i. e. using audio-visual media, asking students to perform in front of the class, giving feedback on the students’ pronunciation).

In this study, my research team implemented various communication games together with some <b>accompanying</b> <b>actions,</b> such as maximizing the use of classroom English during the teaching and learning process, using various and interesting teaching media, making variations in grouping the students, giving pronunciation drilling and speaking strategies before playing the games, and giving feedback and rewards toward the students’ performance. All the actions were implemented to improve the quality of English teaching and learning process, especially the students’ speaking skill. This study was action research. It involved myself, my peer-collaborator, the English teacher, the Principal, and the students of VIII F class altogether as the research participants. It consisted of two cycles. Based on the preliminary observation, it was found that the main problem was the lack of opportunity given for the students’ to practice speaking and also the teaching and learning condition which did not effectively support the students in developing their speaking skill. The data of this study was gained by doing observation in the teaching and learning process, interviewing the students of VIII F class and holding some discussions with my research team about the implementation of the actions. The instruments for collecting the data were a video camera, a digital camera, a voice recorder, observation sheets, and interview guidelines, and therefore, the data were in the form of audio and video recordings, interview transcripts, field notes and photographs. The data were then analyzed qualitatively and systematically including assembling, coding, comparing the data, building interpretations and reporting the outcomes. To avoid the subjectivity in analyzing the data, the triangulation technique was carried out to gather multiple perspectives from the involved members. It was also aimed to fulfill the reliability and validity of the study, namely democratic, outcome, process, catalytic and dialogic validity. The results of this study show that the use of communication games together with the <b>accompanying</b> <b>actions</b> were successful in improving the students’ speaking skill. Particularly, the games were very effective to encourage the students to speak confidently and intelligibly in the target language and interact with one another very well in real communication. They also became more enthusiastic in doing learning activities. Furthermore, the teaching and learning process became livelier and run effectively, and therefore, the students became more actively involved in the process...|$|E

The deep penetration of metal has been numerically investigated, and the convective agitation mechanism of melt by pressure power of metal vapours has been studied. The relations of mechanical impulse of vapour pressure on metal upon the laser radiation parameters and properties of material have been obtained. The influence of temperature relation, absorption factor and heat conduction on the initial stage of deep metal penetration has been elucidatedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
