30|$|It {{should be}} noted that the various entropy methods that are very popular in EEG time series {{analysis}} [1, 6, 7] like Sample Entropy (SampEn) [8], Lempel–Ziv complexity [9], auto-mutual information, Shannon’s entropy, and other approximate entropies are most similar according to Fulcher et al. [5] to the approximate entropy algorithm (ApEn) proposed by Pincus [10]. Unfortunately, current entropy measures are mostly unable to quantify the complexity of any underlying structure in the series, as well as determine if the variation arises from a random process [11]. Since a high entropy score indicates a random or chaotic series, and a low score indicates a high degree of regularity [11], it would be better to use them, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> just, <b>for</b> <b>now,</b> only <b>for</b> comparisons between different conditions (e.g., resting vs. task) or systems (e.g., young vs. old) as was suggested in [12].|$|R

40|$|During the {{sovereign}} debt crisis some EU member states 'stepped outside' the EU legal order and institutional framework and instead resorted to {{public international law}} when concluding international agreements. This paper examines the reasons behind such moves, {{as well as their}} legal and institutional consequences. At several moments during {{the sovereign}} debt crisis of 2010 - 2012, Member State governments of the European Union concluded international agreements between themselves: the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and the Fiscal Compact were all agreed in this manner. In each of those cases, a group of EU member states ‘stepped outside’ the EU legal order and the Union’s institutional framework, and instead resorted to instruments of public international law for organising their cooperation. This paper examines the reasons why this turn to international law occurred, and also the legal and institutional consequences of these moves away from EU law. The paper argues that we are not witnessing, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> not <b>for</b> <b>now,</b> an ‘intergovernmental plot’ designed to exclude the supranational institutions of the EU, but rather argues that contingent and plausible reasons explain the use of international law in each case, and that the damage to the constitutional integrity of the European Union is rather limited...|$|R
60|$|Jane and Maurice {{remained}} in the garden till teatime, and thus missed hearing the whole affair discussed in the drawing-room between Emily, Lilias, and Frank. This was the first news that Emily heard of it, and a very great relief it was, for she could imagine liking, and even loving, Alethea as a sister-in-law. Her chief annoyance was at present from {{the perception of the}} difference between her own position and that of Lilias. Last year how was Lily regarded in the family, and what was her opinion worth? Almost nothing; she was only a clever, romantic, silly girl, while Emily had credit <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>for</b> discretion. <b>Now</b> Lily was consulted and sought out by father, brothers, Eleanor--no longer treated as a child. And what was Emily? Blamed or pitied on every side, and left to hear this important news from the chance mention of her brother-in-law, himself not fully informed. She had become nobody, and had even lost the satisfaction, such as it was, of fancying that her father only made her bad management an excuse for his marriage. She heard many particulars from Lily {{in the course of the}} evening, as they were going to bed; and the sisters talked with all their wonted affection, although Emily had not thought it worth while to revive an old grievance, by asking Lily's pardon for her unkind speech, and rested satisfied with the knowledge that her sister knew her heart too well to care for what she said in a moment of irritation. On the other hand, Lily did not think that she had a right to mention the plan of Alethea's government, and the next day she was glad of her reserve, for her father called her to share his early walk for the purpose of talking over the scheme, telling her that he thought she understood the state of things better than Eleanor could, and that he considered that she had sufficient influence with Emily to prevent her from making Alethea uncomfortable. The conclusion of the conversation was, that they thought they might depend upon Emily's amiability, her courtesy, and her dislike of trouble, to balance her love of importance and dignity. And that Alethea would do nothing to hurt her feelings, and would assume no authority that she could help, they felt convinced.|$|R

40|$|This {{piece is}} an {{exercise}} I consider a failure, but, as such, a meaningful artifact. On the one hand, I have been becoming increasingly frustrated by writing; on the other, I {{have been trying to}} resolve a piece whose first iteration took form in late July this year. There were a few different key components, including a sculptural/architectural structure, reminiscent of a temporary shelter, intended for one body; and the core of this work was a performance, which took place without much preemptive announcement and similarly remained not excessively documented. I was interested in the seemingly ephemeral formal nature of the work and yet the potential, due to its content, to be quite the opposite and to linger and even fester. The performance component of this piece was my setting a timer and speaking without any preparation at all for 1 hour 20 minutes about trauma. The specific topic isn’t so important, although I enjoy something like the lyricism that the ostensible content densifies the ideas of articulation, especially spontaneous articulation and all the otherwise hidden tics and convulsions that become manifest in extemporaneity. I am still processing that experience and still very much in the midst of trying to resolve this piece. One of the important components of this aforementioned piece is its unrepeatability; this seems to best fit the formal logic that the work suggests for itself. A hurdle, then, in pursuing further investigation. Hence the idea to try a variation of it in which I improvise sensory deprivation as well as disorientation and talk, again without preparation, this time about the space of a studio and trying to transfer that space in some way to another place. To furthermore remove the locus or formal/physical center of the work, there was no separate architecture and instead the whole of my studio became the “temporary shelter” and the voice became material in lieu of wood, plastic, metal etc. And the tangibility of this voice becomes manifest in the transcription. So the exercise was to test the wager that while the manifest material components of the work changed, that the content would remain. That the content, as I said, wasn’t the ostensible content (trauma) but something else, something I have thus far found unnameable. But if forced, then I would say it is something like articulation and testing the threshold of articulability. Why this exercise fails, <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>for</b> me right <b>now,</b> is that the materiality and physicality, which get necessarily lost through the transcription, appear more than ever to be in fact quite essential to the piece. Perhaps failure is a misnomer. It is rather that this other form rather than evolving the piece seems to rather just render another kind of work. And in that, it perhaps does what I wanted it to: to transport to another space, while playing with the ideas of transport and of space. Though I am still not convinced that text is the way that is most native to the work I’m after, it is nevertheless making me begin to think anew about so many complications endemic to performance/action, about the complexities between score and execution, about trying to master or manipulate time, about trying to subvert known architectures...|$|R
