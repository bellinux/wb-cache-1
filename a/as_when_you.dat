2500|$|In {{her book}} Native Speakers, Cotera {{argues that the}} {{significance}} of the co-authorship of this novel has often been ignored, under analyzed, and wrongly criticized. [...] The novel has been criticized and rejected by both Chicana/o scholars and historically white publishers because of the unique collaboration between González and Eimer. [...] This {{played a significant role in}} the failure of getting Caballero published during their lifetimes. [...] González was extremely frustrated by this during her life. [...] There has, however, been a strong counterargument to these rejections that considers the power of these two women from such different backgrounds speaking out together against [...] "the singularity of patriarchal thinking and its bankrupt formulations of identity and authority". Another fascinating component of this collaboration is that it simultaneously tells the Mexican side of the war and reflects a partnership between a Mexican-American and Anglo-American author. [...] Cotera argues that it is only natural for these women to work together as [...] "the notion of a singular author is a construct of modernity that is inextricably linked ‘to the development of modern capitalism and of intellectual property, to Western rationalism, and to patriarchy’". [...] Caballero works to undo this discourse through collaboration <b>as</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> write together [...] "you have to desire the collaborative world under formation more than the unextended ‘yours’ and ‘mine’ of the old power structures".|$|E
