5|$|In 1947, a {{delegation}} from Dade County prompted the Florida State Legislature {{to support the}} development of a state Marine Laboratory in conjunction with the UM lab.

The relationship lasted for 12 years until the state of Florida built the board <b>a</b> <b>lab</b> in St. Petersburg.

5|$|On 2 December 1942, {{as part of}} the Manhattan Project, {{another team}} led by Enrico Fermi was able to {{initiate}} the first artificial self-sustained nuclear chain reaction, Chicago Pile-1. An initial plan using enriched uranium-235 was abandoned as it was as yet unavailable in sufficient quantities. Working in <b>a</b> <b>lab</b> below the stands of Stagg Field at the University of Chicago, the team created the conditions needed for such a reaction by piling together 400short tons (360metric tons) of graphite, 58short tons (53metric tons) of uranium oxide, and six short tons (5.5 metric tons) of uranium metal, a majority of which was supplied by Westinghouse Lamp Plant in a makeshift production process.|$|E

5|$|Hansen soon finds Bakharev, {{who tells}} him that to disable the radio jammer around the rig so he can contact Bennett, he will need Anischenko to get him past a retinal scanner. Bakharev is then dragged into an air duct and killed. Hansen learns that Kamsky and Bakharev were under orders to make the exocels as {{dangerous}} as possible, which they had succeeded in doing, but without any way to control the resulting creatures. Hansen finds and kills Anischenko, removing his eye and using it to deactivate the radio jammer. Once {{back in touch with}} Bennett, Hansen is told he must find Kamsky's laptop and transmit the exocel research. Meanwhile, Anna is rescued from the sea by a large creature and left in <b>a</b> <b>lab,</b> where she is infected by an exocel.

5|$|In 2002 the {{researchers}} Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones explored Casler's first explanation, arguing {{that people have}} a basic desire {{to feel good about}} themselves and behave according to that desire. These automatic positive associations would influence feelings about almost anything associated with the self. Given the mere ownership effect, which states that people like things more if they own them, {{the researchers}} theorised that people would develop an affection for objects and concepts that are associated with the self, such as their name. They called this unconscious power implicit egotism. Uri Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices. Low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity would show an effect. Raymond Smeets theorised that if implicit egotism stems from a positive evaluation of the self, then people with low self-esteem would not gravitate towards choices associated with the self, but possibly away from them. <b>A</b> <b>lab</b> experiment confirmed this.|$|E
5|$|In early 1932, {{a letter}} Rhoads {{had written in}} November 1931, which disparaged Puerto Ricans and claimed he had killed and {{intentionally}} injected cancer cells into his patients, was given by <b>a</b> <b>lab</b> assistant to Puerto Rican nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos. He publicized the letter in the Puerto Rican and American media, {{which led to a}} scandal, an official investigation, and a US whitewashing campaign to protect Rhoads and, by extension, Rockefeller interests. In the ensuing investigation, Rhoads defended himself, saying he had written his comments in anger and as a joke to a New York colleague. Neither Puerto Rico's Attorney General nor the medical community found evidence of his or the project's giving any inappropriate medical treatment, and the scandal was forgotten.|$|E

A short while later, as Skinner walks down a hallway, rogue agent Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) activates nanobots {{that he had}} previously placed in Skinner's bloodstream as blackmail. Skinner stumbles in pain, and in an elevator, Krycek reveals himself to Skinner and explains {{that he has a}} vaccine which could save Mulder's life. However, he will only give it if Skinner can ensure that Scully does not give birth to her baby for reasons that he does not disclose. Later, alone in his hospital bed, Miles regains consciousness and goes to take a shower. While doing so, his decaying flesh falls away, revealing a healthy body beneath. He tries to persuade Scully and Doggett that the aliens who abducted him are trying to save humanity. Scully, however, gets <b>a</b> <b>lab</b> report which reveals that Miles's DNA has substantially changed; he is now a new being. Skinner later tells Scully that there is a cure for Mulder's disease, but does not explain Krycek's demands.|$|E
