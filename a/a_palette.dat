5|$|Beck Hansen (born Bek David Campbell; July 8, 1970), known professionally as Beck, is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and multi-instrumentalist. He {{is mostly}} {{known for his}} musical composition, as well as <b>a</b> <b>palette</b> of sonic genres.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{features}} other modes: Color Edit, <b>a</b> <b>palette</b> swap editor {{that allows the}} player to customize nearly {{every aspect of the}} characters, including buckles and hair; Training, in which a player can practice with (and against) computer-controlled opponents and Arcade, similar to the survival mode featured in other fighting games.|$|E
5|$|In December 1888 {{he painted}} La Berceuse – {{a figure that}} he thought {{as good as his}} sunflowers. It has a limited palette, varied brushstrokes and simple contours. It appears to be a {{culmination}} of portraits of the Roulin family completed in Arles between November and December. The portraits show a shift in style from the fluid, restrained brushstrokes and even surface of Portrait of the Postman to the frenetic style, rough surface, broad brushstrokes and use of <b>a</b> <b>palette</b> knife in Madame Roulin with Baby.|$|E

5|$|In October 2002, {{four months}} after Thrud issue 1 was published, Critchlow {{returned}} to 2000AD using his new computer-drawn style. His first story was the Judge Dredd, Out of the Undercity story written by John Wagner. The new style was initially well received by 2000AD Review and seen as a marked improvement over his previous fully painted style with clearer figures and atmospheric colouring. As the Undercity story developed, however, Critchlow was criticised for using too narrow <b>a</b> <b>palette,</b> with too many greys and blues, although {{this might have been}} {{as a result of the}} story being set underground.|$|E
5|$|Mario Bros. also {{introduced}} Mario's brother, Luigi, who {{was created for}} the multiplayer mode by doing <b>a</b> <b>palette</b> swap of Mario. The two-player mode and several aspects of gameplay were inspired by Joust. To date, Mario Bros. has been released {{for more than a}} dozen platforms. The first movement from Mozart's Eine kleine Nachtmusik is used {{at the start of the}} game. This song has been used in later video games, including Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix and Super Smash Bros. Brawl.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Bros. 3 {{includes}} a multiplayer option which allows two players to cooperatively {{play the game}} by taking turns at navigating the overworld map and accessing stage levels; the first player controls Mario, while the other controls Luigi (<b>a</b> <b>palette</b> swap of Mario). Through this mode, players can access several mini-games, including a remake of the original Mario Bros. arcade game, in which one player {{has the opportunity to}} steal the cards of another but may lose their turn if they lose the mini-game.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{problems}} associated with using <b>a</b> fixed color <b>palette</b> {{is that many of the}} needed colors may not be available in the palette, and many of the available colors may not be needed; <b>a</b> fixed <b>palette</b> containing mostly shades of green would not be well-suited for images that do not contain many shades of green, for instance. The use of <b>an</b> optimized color <b>palette</b> can be of benefit in such cases. An optimized color palette is one in which the available colors are chosen based on how frequently they are used in the original source image. If the image is reduced based on <b>an</b> optimized <b>palette</b> the result is often much closer to the original (Figure 4).|$|R

The console uses a Zilog Z80 sub-processor, mainly used {{to control}} the sound hardware and provide backward compatibility with the Master System. The system has 72 kB of RAM, 64 kB of video RAM, and can display up to 61 colors at once from <b>a</b> <b>palette</b> of 512. The games are in ROM cartridge format and inserted in the top.|$|E
5|$|Early in the {{development}} of Dick Tracy, Beatty decided to make the film using <b>a</b> <b>palette</b> limited to just seven colors, primarily red, green, blue and yellow—to evoke the film's comic strip origins; furthermore each of the colors was to be exactly the same shade. Beatty's design team included production designer Richard Sylbert, set decorator Rick Simpson, cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (whom Beatty had worked with on his previous film, Ishtar, as producer and lead actor), visual effects supervisors Michael Lloyd and Harrison Ellenshaw, prosthetic makeup designers John Caglione, Jr. and Doug Drexler, and costume designer Milena Canonero. Their main intention was to stay close to Chester Gould's original drawings from the 1930s. Other influences came from the Art Deco movement and German Expressionism.|$|E
5|$|Reptile was {{originally}} {{depicted as a}} tall, muscular, light-skinned humanoid. Due to his origin as <b>a</b> <b>palette</b> swap of Scorpion and Sub-Zero, his attire was identical to theirs only colored in green. His clothing consists of pants and boots covering his lower body, along with a black sleeveless shirt and open hood. Green light armor covered his forearms and lower legs, while an open V-shaped green vest protected his torso, extending to a matching small fauld and loincloth. He wears a green facial mask {{as part of his}} ninja disguise to conceal his true reptilian nature, however he does remove the mask in-game for his Acid Spit attack or his tongue grab fatality. Reptile stands 6feet (183cm) tall, and speaks in a hissing tone.|$|E
50|$|In addition, some Game Boy {{games have}} <b>a</b> special <b>palette</b> that is enabled when no buttons are pressed. Any game {{that does not}} have <b>a</b> special <b>palette</b> will default to the dark green palette. The default {{palettes}} are stored in a database within the internal boot ROM of the system, and not the game cartridge itself.|$|R

5|$|Video {{output is}} through an RF {{modulator}} and {{was designed for}} use with contemporary television sets, for a simple colour graphic display. Text can be displayed using 32columns × 24rows of characters from the ZX Spectrum character set or from a set provided within an application, from <b>a</b> <b>palette</b> of 15 shades: seven colours at two levels of brightness each, plus black. The image resolution is 256×192 with the same colour limitations. To conserve memory, colour is stored separate from the pixel bitmap in a low resolution, 32×24 grid overlay, corresponding to the character cells. In practice, this means that all pixels of an 8x8 character block share one foreground colour and one background colour.|$|E

25|$|Very {{often these}} {{palettes}} represent people in Greek dress in mythological scenes, {{a few in}} Parthian dress (head-bands over bushy hair, crossed-over jacket on a bare chest, jewelry, belt, baggy trousers), and even fewer in Indo-Scythian dress (Phrygian hat, tunic and comparatively straight trousers). <b>A</b> <b>palette</b> found in Sirkap and now in the New Delhi Museum shows a winged Indo-Scythian horseman riding winged deer, and being attacked by a lion.|$|E
25|$|Gleizes' style changed rapidly between 1905 and 1909. From a paint {{application}} technique akin to Impressionism and <b>a</b> <b>palette</b> {{similar to}} Neo-Impressionism and Fauvism, his painting became more robust. Color and brushwork became simpler, his structural rhythms more pronounced, though softened by curvilinear forms. A synthetic {{view of the}} world—presenting the remarkable properties of space, time, multiplicity and diversity—suddenly materialized. These paintings were a visual parallel to the ideals verbally realized in the Abbaye de Créteil poetry.|$|E
