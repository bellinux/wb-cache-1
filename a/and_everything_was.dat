5|$|In November 2003, {{two years}} after Adams's death and 23 years after the {{production}} on the Secondary Phase had ceased, a new radio adaptation of Adams' unadapted novel Life, the Universe <b>and</b> <b>Everything</b> <b>was</b> announced. This would become the third series of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy on radio. Dirk Maggs, a friend of Adams, was chosen to create, direct and co-produce the adaptations. Maggs had previously consulted with Adams on potential radio adaptations for the final three books in 1993 and 1997. The project was restarted in September 2001 by Maggs, Helen Chattwell and Bruce Hyman, with help from Jane Belson and Ed Victor.|$|E
5|$|Allen's men marched southward {{from the}} base, with the {{intention}} of entering the enemy base camp from a slightly different direction to the west. Preceded by marching artillery fire, the 2nd Battalion stopped periodically to conduct cloverleaf patrols to their front, rear and both flanks. At 9:56am the lead element of Alpha Company stumbled upon a northeast-southwest trail, which appeared to have been used within the last hour. The 1st Platoon Leader then requested and received permission to make cloverleaf patrols to the east and west of the trail. Almost immediately, the 1st Platoon sighted a Viet Cong soldier while scouting west of the trail and another group of Viet Cong soldiers soon appeared. George then ordered the 1st Platoon to set up a hasty ambush across the trail, but {{by the time they were}} in position the Viet Cong soldiers had disappeared <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> quiet. About 10–15 minutes later, the 1st Platoon Leader reported that trees were moving, in addition to the sound of weapons clicking and the rattle of ammunition.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in April 1933, {{scores of}} {{measures}} defining {{the status of}} Jews and their rights were instituted at the regional and national level. Initiatives and legal mandates against the Jews reached their culmination {{with the establishment of}} the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, stripping them of their basic rights. The Nazis would take from the Jews their wealth, their right to intermarry with non-Jews and their right to occupy many fields of labour (such as practising law, medicine or working as educators). They eventually declared them undesirable to remain among German citizens and society, which over time dehumanised the Jews. Arguably, these actions desensitised Germans {{to the extent that it}} resulted in the Holocaust. Ethnic Germans who refused to ostracise Jews or who showed any signs of resistance to Nazi propaganda were placed under surveillance by the Gestapo, had their rights removed or were sent to concentration camps. Everyone <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> monitored in Nazi Germany. Inaugurating and legitimising power for the Nazis was thus accomplished by their initial revolutionary activities, then through the improvisation and manipulation of the legal mechanisms available, through the use of police powers by the Nazi Party (which allowed them to include and exclude from society whomever they chose) and finally by the expansion of authority for all state and federal institutions.|$|E
25|$|It was {{impossible}} to estimate the number involved {{with any degree of}} accuracy because the lighting was poor, the victims were all tangled together, <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> covered with a thick layer of black dust. Many of the victims were writhing in agony and were screaming for individual attention. It was obvious from an early stage that the main problem was the disentanglement of a heap of people, many of whom appeared to be in imminent danger of suffocation.|$|E
25|$|A radio {{adaptation}} of Life, the Universe <b>and</b> <b>Everything</b> <b>was</b> recorded in 2003 {{under the guidance}} of Dirk Maggs, starring the surviving members of the cast of the original Hitchhiker's radio series. Adams himself, at his own suggestion, makes a cameo appearance; due to his death before production began on the series, this was achieved by sampling his character's dialogue from an audio book of the novel read by Adams that was published in the 1990s. The radio adaptation debuted on BBC Radio 4 in September 2004.|$|E

25|$|During the Victorian era Canvey {{became a}} very fashionable place to visit, and its air was {{promoted}} as having healing properties. This started in 1899, after the Black Monday floods, when an entrepreneur called Frederick Hester bought Leigh Beck Farm, and started {{what was to}} be called Southview Park estate. The properties sold very quickly so Frederick bought more plots of land, selling them as dream homes for London's Eastenders. Hester wanted to create Canvey as a great seaside resort for Londoners, and so built the first promenade, a pier and a magnificent winter garden & palace, of which he planned to cover six miles (but only covered a mile), as well as a mono rail system (initially horse drawn then later electric). Hester marketed Canvey as Ye Old Dutch Island giving many of the new roads Dutch sounding names, and enticing potential buyers with free rail tickets. The project started well with thousands of plots sold, however by 1905 the scheme had fallen apart due to materials not being delivered and issues with land ownership with the laying of the mono rail. Hester was declared bankrupt <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> sold off at an auction held at Chimney's Farm.|$|E

[...] Carlile continued to impeach the legitimacy of Virginia's referendum on secession.|$|E
500|$|For {{its second}} album, Pearl Jam felt the {{pressures}} of trying to match the success of its debut album, Ten. In a 2002 interview, guitarist Mike McCready said, [...] "The band was blown up pretty big <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> pretty crazy." [...] Vs. was the first Pearl Jam album to have production duties handled by producer Brendan O'Brien. It was also the band's first album with drummer Dave Abbruzzese, who had joined the band in August 1991 and toured for the album Ten. Rehearsals for Vs. began in February 1993 at Potatohead Studio in Seattle, Washington. The band then moved to The Site in Nicasio, California in March 1993 to begin recording. Abbruzzese called the tranquil recording site [...] "paradise" [...] while lead vocalist Eddie Vedder said, [...] "I fucking hate it here... I've had a hard time...

500|$|Cited {{by many as}} one of {{the best}} {{amusement}} rides in the world, The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man has been well received. Howard Shapiro of The Philadelphia Inquirer stated the ride was [...] "bound to become one of the all-time attractions of theme parks anywhere". He described the climax of the ride the [...] "most amazing effect". Bill Dean of The Ledger described the ride as the [...] "most impressive" [...] attraction at Islands of Adventure. Guests interviewed by Dean praised the ride with comments including [...] "I loved it", [...] "I think this is better [...] because of the 3-D effects", and [...] "it was so exciting <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> happening all at once, so it was really, really good".

500|$|Orion {{was less}} {{resolute}} {{in terms of}} who they wanted for the role of Agent Alan Ward. After filming The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), Willem Dafoe expressed interest in playing Ward, and Parker traveled to Los Angeles, where he met with the actor to discuss the role. Dafoe was cast shortly thereafter. To prepare for the role, Dafoe researched the time period and Neshoba County. He also read Willie Morris's 1983 novel The Courting of Marcus Dupree, and looked at 1960s documentary footage detailing how the media covered the murder case. Frances McDormand plays Mrs. Pell, the wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell. On working with Hackman, McDormand said, [...] "...in Mississippi Burning, I didn't do research. All I did was listen to [...] He had an amazing capacity for not giving away any part of himself (in read-throughs). But the minute we got on the set, little blinds on his eyes flipped up <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> available. It was mesmerizing.

500|$|The name Kaali means Kaala {{or force}} of time. When there were neither the creation, nor the sun, the moon, the planets, and the earth, {{there was only}} {{darkness}} <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> created from the darkness. The Dark appearance of Kaali represents the darkness from which everything was born. Her complexion is deep blue, like the sky and ocean water as blue. As she is also the goddess of Preservation, Kaali is worshiped as the preserver of nature. Kaali is standing calm on Shiva ,her appearance represents the preservation of mother nature. Her free, long and black hair represents nature's freedom from civilization. Under the third eye of kali, the signs of both sun, moon and fire are visible which represent the driving forces of nature.Kaali is not always {{thought of as a}} Dark Goddess. [...] Despite Kaali's origins in battle, She evolved to a full-fledged symbol of Mother Nature in Her creative, nurturing and devouring aspects. She is referred to as a great and loving primordial Mother Goddess in the Hindu tantric tradition. In this aspect, as Mother Goddess, She is referred to as Kaali Ma, meaning Kaali Mother, and millions of Hindus revere Her as such.|$|E

500|$|Returning to Britain in August 1817, {{where the}} story of his {{shipwreck}} and subsequent difficulties had become headline news, Maxwell was widely praised for his leadership. In the court martial convened to investigate the incident he was exonerated of all blame, and especially commended for his calm and authoritative control of the situation. Chief among the witnesses on his behalf was Lord Amherst himself. The court martial reported that [...] "his coolness, self-collectedness and exertions were highly conspicuous, <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> done by him and his officers within the power of man to execute". The following year he was knighted, and in 1819 made a Fellow of the Royal Society. That same year the HEIC presented him with £1,500 as a reward for his services in China and to compensate him for his financial losses in the wreck. An account of the Yellow Sea voyage by Basil Hall was published in 1818 under the title [...] "Account of a Voyage of Discovery to the West Coast of Corea and the Great Loo-Choo Islands". The book was dedicated to Sir Murray Maxwell, and proved popular.|$|E
500|$|The Emperor {{experienced}} an unhappy and solitary childhood. He was considered precocious, docile and obedient, but frequently cried and often {{nothing seemed to}} please him. He [...] "was not raised in luxury <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> very simple." [...] As his sisters could not accompany him at other times, he only had permission to meet them after lunch, and even then for only one hour. He had few friends of his age, {{and the only one}} he retained into adulthood was Luís Pedreira do Couto Ferraz, future Viscount of Bom Retiro. However, he was treated tenderly by Mariana de Verna and also by Rafael, who played with him by carrying him on his shoulders and who also allowed Pedro II to hide in his room to escape from studies. For the greater part of his time, he was surrounded by servants who only had permission to speak to him when questioned. The environment in which Pedro II was raised turned him into a shy and needy person who saw in [...] "books another world where he could isolate and protect himself." [...] Behind the [...] "pomp of the monarchy, of the self-sufficient appearance, there must have lived an unhappy man." ...|$|E

You know, for two pins I'd get myself a horse and a sword." [...] In late 2009, he did make himself a sword, {{with the help of his}} friends. He told a Times Higher Education interviewer that [...] "At the end of last year I made my own sword. I dug out the iron ore from a field about 10miles away – I was helped by interested friends. We lugged 80kilos of iron ore, used clay from the garden and straw to make a kiln, and lit the kiln with wildfire by making it with a bow.' Colin Smythe, his long-term friend and agent, donated some pieces of meteoric iron – 'thunderbolt iron' has a special place in magic and we put that in the smelt, and I remember when we sawed the iron apart it looked like silver.

500|$|The {{episode is}} notable for {{featuring}} the first actual kiss between Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. The series had featured other brushes with kisses {{between the two}} leads: in the fourth season episode [...] "Small Potatoes", a shapeshifter, disguised as Mulder, nearly kissed Scully; in the 1998 film, the two's [...] "lips brushed slightly before Scully got stung by a virus-carrying bee"; and in the sixth season entry [...] "Triangle", Mulder kissed a Scully-lookalike from the 1930s in a reverie of his. John Shiban developed {{the idea for a}} Mulder–Scully kiss, which was described by series creator Chris Carter as a [...] "present for the fans." [...] Shiban noted that the episode's kiss felt like [...] "the logical culmination of their relationship. They had been heading toward the kiss for years". Gillian Anderson later explained that, [...] "David [...] and I knew the kiss was coming. [...] I felt the editors of that episode milked it in a very effective way." [...] In order to create the atmosphere of the scene, specialized camera angles were used <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> slowed down to make the scene last longer. The Millennium Ball scene was digitally created on a computer because the episode was filmed in October, two months before the event was scheduled to take place. Special effects producer Bill Millar was tasked with digitally adding the number [...] "2000" [...] into archival footage of Dick Clark's 1999 New Years Eve show.

500|$|Pearl Jam {{headed into}} the studio in early 1993 facing the {{challenge}} of following up the commercial success of its debut. McCready said, [...] "The band was blown up pretty big <b>and</b> <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> pretty crazy." [...] Released on October 19, 1993, Pearl Jam's second album, Vs., sold 950,378 copies in its first week of release and outperformed all other entries in the Billboard top ten that week combined. The album set the record for most copies of an album sold in its first week of release, which it held until broken by Garth Brooks' 1998 album, Double Live. Vs. included the singles [...] "Go", [...] "Daughter", [...] "Animal", and [...] "Dissident". Paul Evans of Rolling Stone said, [...] "Few American bands have arrived more clearly talented than this one did with Ten; and Vs. tops even that debut." [...] He added, [...] "Like Jim Morrison and Pete Townshend, Vedder makes a forte of his psychological-mythic explorations... As guitarists Stone Gossard and Mike McCready paint dense and slashing backdrops, he invites us into a drama of experiment and strife." [...] The band decided, beginning {{with the release of}} Vs., to scale back its commercial efforts. The members declined to produce any more music videos after the massive success of [...] "Jeremy" [...] and opted for fewer interviews and television appearances. Industry insiders compared Pearl Jam's tour that year to the touring habits of Led Zeppelin, in that the band [...] "ignored the press and took its music directly to the fans." [...] During the Vs. Tour, the band set a cap on ticket prices in an attempt to thwart scalpers.|$|E
