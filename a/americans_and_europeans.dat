5|$|Contact with <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Europeans</b> in {{the early}} 19th century brought more {{settlers}} to the island, and had a lasting negative ecological effect. On lower slopes, vast tracts of koa–ōhia forest were converted to farmland. Higher up, feral animals that escaped from ranches found refuge in, and damaged extensively, Mauna Kea's native māmane–naio forest. Non-native plants are the other serious threat; there are over 4,600 introduced species on the island, whereas the number of native species is estimated at just 1,000.|$|E

Use of the quarry declined between this period and contact with <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Europeans.</b> As part of the ritual associated with quarrying, the workers erected shrines to their gods; these and other quarry artifacts remain at the sites, most of which lie within what is now the Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve.|$|E
40|$|Japanese {{corporations}} <b>and</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations take {{different approaches}} {{when it comes}} to business in China in general : (i) American corporations are concentrated in the music, motion picture, and software industries, so they have a particular interest in solving copyright infringement problems; (ii) <b>American</b> <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations have started to actively use China as a base for research and development; <b>and</b> (iii) many <b>American</b> corporations have clear China-specific technological strategies. The systems for managing intellectual property in China also differ among Japanese corporations <b>and</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations : (i) whether <b>American</b> <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations have an IP department depends on the individual corporations overall management policies; (ii) locally hired employees managing intellectual property in <b>American</b> <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations are usually the ones entrusted with important IP-related duties; (iii) there are many requirements for employment and the remuneration is high for locally hired employees managing intellectual property in <b>American</b> <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations; <b>and</b> (iv) relatively few Japanese corporations attribute intellectual property rights to their subsidiaries in China. Various aspects also differentiate Japanese corporations <b>and</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations in terms of the measures they take to combat counterfeit products : (i) <b>American</b> <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations show a similar trend as Japanese corporations toward taking administrative enforcement measures or civil proceedings, but a trend toward using criminal proceedings is emerging among <b>American</b> <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations; (ii) in <b>American</b> <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations, internal employees often prepare warning letters, conduct research, and collect evidence; (iii) the budget of <b>American</b> <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations for measures to combat counterfeit products is far greater than that of Japanese corporations; (iv) <b>American</b> <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations are active in exchanging information with and collecting information from governments; <b>and</b> (v) <b>American</b> corporations emphasize using estimated amounts of damages and quantifying the effectiveness of their measures to combat counterfeit products. Two key points stand out as being essential when considering measures to combat leakages of technology and infringements of trade secrets : (A) that good personnel management is effective as a measure for combating the leakage of technology and the infringement of trade secrets; and (B) that good information management is essential for preventing technology leakages and trade secret infringements. Many differences are evident between Japanese corporations <b>and</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations with respect to these measures : (i) <b>American</b> <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations are more active than Japanese corporations in willfully transferring technology to China; (ii) Japanese corporations are considerably less popular in China than <b>American</b> <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations; (iii) <b>American</b> <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations are more progressive in terms of assigning managerial powers to Chinese management personnel; (iv) the level of compensation offered at Japanese corporations in China is considerably lower than that offered at <b>American</b> <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations in China; (v) <b>American</b> <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations in China engage in corporate PR in many different ways, but Japanese corporations in China do not do enough; (vi) <b>American</b> <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations employ various initiatives to increase the motivation of Chinese personnel; and (vii) Regulations at <b>American</b> <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations provide severe punishment for personnel who divulge secrets. Japanese corporations <b>and</b> <b>American</b> <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations take different approaches {{when it comes to}} strategies for intellectual property and preventing technology leakage in China. But it is important that Japan adopts the good aspects of the methods used by <b>American</b> <b>and</b> <b>European</b> corporations {{at the same time as}} it continues to collaborate and cooperate with international institutions, governments, and anti-counterfeiting organizations. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{first people}} to rush to the goldfields, {{beginning}} {{in the spring of}} 1848, were the residents of California themselves—primarily agriculturally oriented <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Europeans</b> living in Northern California, along with Native Americans and some Californios (Spanish-speaking Californians). These first miners tended to be families in which everyone helped in the effort. Women and children of all ethnicities were often found panning next to the men. Some enterprising families set up boarding houses to accommodate the influx of men; in such cases, the women often brought in steady income while their husbands searched for gold.|$|E
5|$|The see of Philadelphia {{had been}} vacant {{since the death}} of Bishop Michael Francis Egan in 1814, despite several efforts to fill it. Archbishop John Carroll of Baltimore, whose {{province}} included Philadelphia, had considered no fewer than fifteen priests for the position; some had been ruled out for one reason or another, and others (including the apostolic administrator, Louis de Barth) had turned the job down. Part of the delay was logistical—Carroll was unsure of the exact procedure for selecting a candidate in the recently erected province—but part was due to the perceived undesirability of the post, which oversaw only a few small churches {{in a part of the}} nation with few Catholics. There was also a significant dispute (known as trusteeism) over the rights of churches' lay trustees that was likely to complicate the job of running the diocese. In Europe, the Church owned property and directly controlled its parishes through the clergy. In the United States, however, early Catholic churches were typically founded by laymen who purchased the property, and erected the church buildings. Those laypeople accordingly demanded some control over the administration of the parish, even after the arrival of clergy from Europe who held the traditional view of parish organization. In a larger sense, the dispute represented a difference in understandings of authority between <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Europeans.</b>|$|E

In addition, they sold pemmican at the posts. Unlike Indians, the Métis were dependent on the fur trade system and subject to the market. The international prices of bison robes were directly influential on the well-being of Métis communities. By contrast, the local Indians had a more diverse resource base and were less dependent on <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Europeans</b> at this time.|$|E

25|$|Fukuzawa {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{influential}} people ever that helped Japan modernize into the country it is today. He never accepted any high position and remained a normal Japanese citizen for his whole life. By the time of his death, he was revered as one of the founders of modern Japan. All of his work was written and was released at a critical juncture in the Japanese society and uncertainty for the Japanese people about their future after the signing of the Unequal treaties, their realization in the weakness of the Japanese government at the time (Tokugawa Shogunate) and its inability to repel the American and European influence. It should also be noted that there were bands of samurai that forcefully opposed the <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Europeans</b> and their friends through murder and destruction. Fukuzawa was in danger of his life as a samurai group killed one of his colleagues for advocating policies like those of Fukuzawa. Fukuzawa wrote at a time when the Japanese people were undecided on whether they should be bitter about the American and European forced treaties and imperialism, or to understand the West and move forward. Fukuzawa greatly aided the ultimate success of the pro-modernization forces.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s and 1990s, {{while the}} inflow of foreign workers {{remained}} steady, the demographic composition of these migration flows changed. While the initial {{part of the}} third wave mainly brought Arab migrant workers to the Gulf region, their numbers declined during the 1980s and 1990s as they were replaced with Southeast Asian migrants. In comparison, there were approximately 2.000.000 migrant workers in the oil-producing countries, of which 68% were Arab workers, while in 1983 {{the total number of}} migrant workers had risen to 5.000.000, of which only 55% were Arab migrants. More specifically, in Saudi Arabia the number of Arab migrant workers decreased from 90% to 32% between 1975 and 1985. This change in composition was caused by a change in attitude towards Arab foreign workers. At first, the shared language, religion and culture were seen as benefits by the GCC states. Nevertheless, the rise of Pan-Arabism in the region heightened authorities' fears of political activism and anti-government activities by Arab migrants. Furthermore, the authorities feared that the often low-educated Arab migrants would corrupt the culture of the Gulf states. Thus Asia, and specifically India, became the obvious solution for the GCC countries, considering the historical ties, the geographical proximity and the abundance of workers willing to migrate to the Gulf region. Although the majority of migrants to the GCC today come from either Asia or other Middle Eastern countries, with India making up the highest number, a high number of North <b>Americans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Europeans</b> also migrate to the GCC region. Especially Kuwait and Oman constitute a target destination for high-skilled workers mainly from the United States, the United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden and France. All in all, the third wave has resulted in that more than 50% of the workforce in any of the GCC countries consists of migrant workers.|$|E
