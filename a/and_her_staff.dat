Consequently, in March 1868 Lucy Osburn was sent out as Lady Superintendent of the Infirmary and was accompanied by five trained nurses. Osburn won Parkes' trust and began the challenging task of cleaning up the crumbling, foul-smelling and vermin-infested Infirmary. A week after their arrival they had a royal patient, when the Duke of Edinburgh was wounded by a would-be assassin at Clontarf. They nursed him at Government House, not Sydney Hospital. In spite of the public acclaim this brought them, Lucy Osburn <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>staff</b> faced much resistance in their efforts to reform the infirmary. In addition to the appalling conditions, they met with hostility and opposition. The idea of gentlewomen working as hospital nurses was still novel, and to many people shocking. Lucy was continually obstructed by one surgeon, Dr Alfred Roberts, and personally attacked in the Parliament.|$|E
