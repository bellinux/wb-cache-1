5|$|Media {{coverage}} of the movement has focused on popular leaders, such as Hensley, and the deaths of ministers by snakebite have received particular attention. Practitioners of snake handling continue to view Hensley as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>man.</b> Kimbrough recorded a discussion with an advocate of snake handling who dismissed Hensley's personal failings as slanderous fabrications. His advocacy, leadership, and– in particular– his personal charisma were important factors in the advancement of the movement.|$|E

5|$|Harold Larwood {{maintained}} {{great respect}} for Jardine, treasuring a gift his captain gave him after the Bodyline tour and believing him to be <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>man.</b> Jardine showed affection for Larwood in return even after both of their retirements; he expressed his concern for the way Larwood was treated, hosted a lunch for the former fast bowler shortly before he emigrated to Australia and met him there in 1954. On the other hand, Donald Bradman would never speak to journalists about Bodyline or Jardine, and refused to give a tribute when Jardine died in 1958. Jack Fingleton {{admitted that he had}} liked Jardine and stated that he and Larwood had each done their job on the Bodyline tour, and expressed regret at the way both left cricket in acrimonious circumstances. Fingleton also described Jardine as an aloof individual who preferred to take his time in judging a person before befriending them, a quality that caused problems in Australia. Bill O'Reilly stated that he disliked Jardine at the time of Bodyline, but on meeting him later found him agreeable and even charming.|$|E
5|$|The poem's {{focus on}} France {{served as a}} way for Southey to discuss his {{feelings}} about the French Revolution. In particular, Southey was upset that the British were calling men from their farms to serve as a militia during the time. In terms of the French, Southey did not support Robespierre and the others who followed him in France. However, he did support the idea of the French Republic. When he heard of Marie Antoinette's execution in October 1793, Southey told his friend Bedford that he condemned the action although he held to his Republican beliefs. However, he was further upset when word came that Brissot, the Girondin leader, was executed. This caused him to believe that all of the countries were equally bad, except the Republican United States, which he hoped to make his home. In 1794, many of Southey's feelings on Robespierre's involvement in these actions were included in both Joan of Arc and the Fall of Robbespierre, which followed after Robespierre's own execution. However, Southey had by then become very radical and believed that Robespierre was <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>man</b> who only helped mankind in his actions.|$|E

His teacher told him that he should grow up to be <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>man,</b> and to do this he needed to leave Kanagawa Prefecture and study hard.|$|E

The next service is proceeding and Miss Carnaby is about to be injected again when Mr Cole steps in. There is a fight and the police pour into the room.

25|$|Despite the {{difficulties}} with Moran's book, the many illustrations it provides of a Churchill understandably plunged into temporary low mood by military defeats and other severely adverse developments constitute a compelling portrait of <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>man</b> reacting to, but not significantly impeded by, worry and overstrain, a compelling portrait that is entirely {{consistent with the}} portraits of others who worked closely with Churchill. Churchill did not receive medication for depression—the amphetamine that Moran prescribed for special occasions, especially for big speeches from the autumn of 1953 onwards, was to combat the effects of Churchill's stroke of that year.|$|E
25|$|In {{reaction}} to The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail, The Da Vinci Code, and other controversial books, websites and films {{on the same}} theme, {{a significant number of}} individuals in the late 20th and early 21st centuries have adhered to a Jesus bloodline hypothesis despite its lack of substantiation. While some simply entertain it as a novel intellectual proposition, others hold it as an established belief thought to be authoritative and not to be disputed. Prominent among the latter are those who expect a direct descendant of Jesus will eventually emerge as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>man</b> and become a messiah, a Great Monarch who rules a Holy European Empire, during an event which they will interpret as a mystical second coming of Christ.|$|E
25|$|Everything is at last revealed, and Oedipus curses {{himself and}} fate {{before leaving the}} stage. The chorus laments how even <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>man</b> can be felled by fate, and {{following}} this, a servant exits the palace to speak {{of what has happened}} inside. When Jocasta enters the house, she runs to the palace bedroom and hangs herself there. Shortly afterward, Oedipus enters in a fury, calling on his servants to bring him a sword so that he might cut out his mother's womb. He then rages through the house, until he comes upon Jocasta's body. Giving a cry, Oedipus takes her down and removes the long gold pins that held her dress together, before plunging them into his own eyes in despair.|$|E

25|$|Garry Sobers, the West Indies' {{captain and}} their best cricketer, caused {{controversy}} by {{playing in a}} double-wicket competition in Rhodesia in September 1970. Although Sobers spent only 48 hours in Salisbury, he had time for a meal with the prime minister, Ian Smith, and described him as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>man</b> to talk to. Sobers' statement and his participation in the tournament gave Caribbean politicians {{an opportunity to make}} clear their hatred of apartheid and racism. The Guyanese prime minister, Forbes Burnham, said Sobers was not welcome in his country until there was an apology. The Jamaican government called for his resignation as captain. The Indian prime minister, Indira Gandhi, forbade the Indian cricket team to tour the West Indies until the matter was sorted out. Sobers initially argued that he had done nothing wrong as he was a cricketer, not a politician, but ultimately apologised in October 1970 when the scandal threatened to break the West Indies team.|$|E

Another book critical of Scott, David Thomson's Scott's Men, was released in 1977. In Thomson's view, Scott was not <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>man,</b> [...] "at least, not until near the end"; his planning is described as [...] "haphazard" [...] and [...] "flawed", his leadership characterised by lack of foresight. Thus by the late 1970s, in Jones's words, [...] "Scott's complex personality had been revealed and his methods questioned".|$|E
