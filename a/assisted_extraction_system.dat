40|$|Sulphur {{determination}} is {{of priority}} in coal investigations {{due to its}} associated environmental pollution. There are generally various forms of sulphur in coal such as organic and inorganic forms both of which need to be characterized. However, it is the organic sulphur present in coal that is not well understood and studied. In this work, total and various forms of sulphur {{have been identified in}} raw coal samples from Camden, Majuba, Lethabo, Kriel, Duvha and Thuthuka power stations in South Africa. Organic sulphur compounds (2 - methyl thiophene, 3 -methyl thiophene, 2 -ethyl thiophene and dibenzothiophene) were characterized from these coal samples {{in order to determine the}} quality of South African coal. Organic sulphur compounds were extracted from coal samples by means of ultrasonic bath. The extraction of organic sulphur compounds was first optimised by using various organic solvents such as dichloromethane, toluene and hexane followed by quantification using gas chromatography with a flame ionisation detector. The extraction time was also optimized from 0 to 75 minutes while spiked standard concentrations were varied from 1700 to 17000 mg kg- 1 to control the process. Ultrasonic extracts were analyzed by GC equipped with SPB- 1 Sulphur column and flame ionisation detector. Microwave assisted extraction was used to extract various forms of sulphur in coal. During sequential extraction, sulphate and pyrite sulphur were extracted from coal samples using hydrochloric acid and nitric acid respectively. Total organic or total sulphur and selected metals in coal were extracted by means of a mixture of concentrated hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid and boric acid. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy allowed the analysis of all total and other inorganic sulphur forms as well as selected metals from Microwave <b>assisted</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>system</b> after calibration set with standards. Total sulphur compounds and other sulphur forms were also determined using elemental analyzer for carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulphur (CHNS). The standard calibration for CHNS determination was assessed by the use of Sulfamethazine, a certified reference material. 2 -methyl thiophene, 3 -methyl thiophene, 2 -ethyl thiophene and dibenzothiophene were identified in coal samples. The organic sulphur compounds found in most coal samples were methyl thiophenes. Extraction time effect on the recovery of organic sulphur compounds showed that the recovery of organic sulphur investigated was up to 88...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was aimed at {{creating}} a microwave <b>assisted</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>system</b> of microalgal lipid, to shorten the extraction time and improve the extraction efficiency. Moreover, through the automatic control reduced the extraction progress, the efficiency of extraction would be raised. This research using dried chorella sp. powder purchased from market was comprised of Soxhlet extraction experiment, comparison of the extraction methods using water bath treatment and microwave treatment, traces analysis of lipid and center point design experiment. The Soxhlet extraction experiment used AOAC 920. 39 C standard lipid extraction method to extract lipid of microalgal. The result using liquid-solid ratio at 150 times of organic solvent and dried microalgal powder weights had shown that the saturation of average lipid contents was about 1. 53 % of dry weight. The fatty acid analysis had also shown that microalgal used in this research were suitable to make the biodiesel oil. Water bath and microwave treatment testing with liquid-solid ratio at 6 times obtained that the best time for the microwave extracting time was 7 minutes, while the temperature at 72. 6 ℃, and the bottle still under the durable pressure. Moreover, the first extracting treatment reached 20. 71 % lipid extraction rate. But after extractions twice, the lipid extraction rate reached saturation at about 45. 24 %. However, water bath treatment obtained lower lipid content about only 10 % at extracting time between 3 and 7 min. The trace analysis was based on Bligh and Dyer Method to compare with the lipid content of microwave treatment, ultrasound treatment and control set treatment. The result had acquired that microalgal lipid reached a saturation level of at 11. 6 % of dry weight. The microwave treatment needed 75 sec, but 1200 sec by ultrasound treatment; it was 16 times of the microwave treatment. The observation using the scanning electron microscope (SEM) demonstrated that the fold of microalgal cell shrunk unevenly through the microwave treatment. It was due to the rapid temperature rise and pressure increase by microwave treatment and resulted in the sudden expansion and burst of the cell thus increasing the lipid extraction ability. The fatty acid composition analysis acquired from the three groups were not significantly different; this also indicated that the microwave assisted extraction broke the cell more effectively, and increased lipid content, but would not decompose the composition of fatty acid. The experiment proved that the microwave assisted extraction method was suitable for use in the micro-algae oil extraction. According to the result of the previous experiments, a microwave <b>assisted</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>system</b> of microalgal lipid was built. The optimal factor design center point design experiment was performed by using response surface methodology (RSM). The experimental results obtained that using extraction time 7 min and liquid-solid ratio 7 times, the best extraction rate at 44. 59 % could be held. However, the pressure rose in extractor due to the solvent heating from the microwave; the maximum temperature and pressure achieved were 14. 37 ℃ and 0. 38 kg/cm 2, respectively. The over temperature and pressure would make the system unstable, which was critical to ensuring safe operations. Further, the experiments with and without pressure increase had acquired that the extraction rate of extraction time 5, 6 and 7 min under pressure increase experimental group were 29. 22 、 40. 71 and 44. 59 %,and with normal pressure less experimental group were 29. 37 、 40. 78 and 44. 89 %, respectively. After the statistical analysis, there were no significant differences between these two groups. The experiment was set 7 min, liquid-solid ratio at 7 times and without pressure increase as the front experimental group to perform the path of steepest ascent experiment. The experimental results obtained that an extraction rate inflection point was 58. 67 % at extraction time 10 min and liquid-solid ratio at 8. 2 times. Based on the parameters of the previous experimental results, the center point design experiment was performed. The experiment found that the best extraction rate was 65. 78 % at extraction time 10 min 45 sec and liquid-solid ratio at 8. 3 times. Using these best results as the conditions of multi-stage extraction, the experiment obtained 94. 96 % of extraction rate at third extraction. It had the same total lipid content with Soxhlet extraction 12 hr. The extraction speed was 22 times of Soxhlet extraction. The results had shown that optimal microwave assisted extraction parameters could extract microalgal lipid efficiently. The final experiment was performed by combing the above experimental results to build an automatic microwave <b>assisted</b> <b>extraction</b> <b>system.</b> It had the central control unit to control the optimal parameters and held the function of sequential operation continuously such as input, extraction, and output to simplify the complicated extraction procedures and to improve the efficiency of lipid extraction to achieve the desired mass microalgal biodiesel production. 本研究旨在建立一微波輔助萃取微藻油脂系統，期能縮短微藻油脂萃取時間，並提高萃取效率，同時透過自動化控制簡化繁雜之萃取操作手續。研究是以市售乾燥之小球藻(chorella sp.) 粉分別進行索式油脂萃取試驗、水浴與微波比較試驗、微量油脂萃取試驗、中心複合設計油脂萃取試驗。其中索式油脂萃取試驗係依AOAC 920. 39 C (1990) 標準法萃取微藻中油脂，在有機溶劑與微藻乾重之液固比 150 倍下，結果獲致油脂含量達飽和狀態時，平均僅約為總乾物重之 1. 53 %，而脂肪酸分析結果則顯示本試驗所使用之微藻做為產製生質柴油之原料應為適合。水浴與微波比較試驗結果獲致在液固比 6 倍下 ，微波萃取時間設定以 7 min為佳，萃取液溫度為 41. 15 ℃仍在血清瓶可承受壓力範圍，且其單次油脂萃取率可達 20. 71 %，而在此萃取時間 7 min設定下，則萃取液經由 2 次萃取後，其萃取率即達飽和約為 45. 24 %，而水浴萃取組其萃取油脂效果不佳，於萃取 3 - 7 min，僅約為 10 %左右。微量油脂萃取試驗依Bligh and Dyer Method進行微波處理、超音波處理及未施與任何處理之對照組之含油量分析比較，結果獲致微藻油脂萃取達飽和狀態時含量為總乾物重之 11. 6 %，而微波處理組之處理時間為 75 sec，超音波處理組則需 1, 200 sec，萃取時間為微波處理組之 16 倍；試驗中以掃描式電子顯微鏡觀察結果獲致，經微波處理後之微藻細胞有不均勻收縮所造成之明顯皺摺，顯示細胞於微波作用下，會因細胞內部溫度急遽上升與壓力增大而膨脹破裂，有助於細胞油脂之萃取；而脂肪酸組成分析結果獲致三組皆無顯著差異，顯示微波輔助萃取法能有效破碎細胞，提高油脂萃取量，亦不會導致油脂中之脂肪酸分解，證實微波萃取方式適用於微藻油脂之萃取。 本研究依據上述萃取基礎試驗所獲致之相關萃取條件參數，建置一微波輔助微藻油脂萃取系統，其最佳化參數設計，即中心複合設計油脂萃取試驗，係利用反應曲面法(Response Surface Methodology, RSM) 進行試驗設計，試驗結果獲致當萃取時間為 7 min與液固比 7 倍時，可獲致較佳之油脂萃取率 44. 59 %。然而於萃取過程中加熱有機溶劑會使萃取器內部壓力上升，其最大溫度與壓力分別達 44. 67 ℃與 0. 38 kg/cm 2 ，過大的溫度與壓力易導致系統不穩定，亦有操作安全上之顧慮。進一步探討加壓與常壓二組對油脂含量影響，其試驗結果獲致於萃取 5 、 6 及 7 min，加壓組萃取率分別為 29. 22 、 40. 71 及 44. 59 %，而常壓組則為 29. 37 、 40. 78 及 44. 89 %，分析結果顯示並無顯著差異。試驗進一步以前述結果 7 min、液固比 7 倍與常壓下作為起始點，進行最陡上升試驗，結果獲致於萃取時間 10 min與液固比 8. 2 倍試驗組，其萃取率 58. 67 %趨於反曲點，即依此最陡上升試驗結果參數，進行中心複合設計試驗，試驗結果獲致試驗參數組合於萃取時間 10 min 45 sec，與液固比 8. 3 倍時可獲致最佳萃取率達 65. 78 %。當以此最佳操作參數進行多級萃取試驗，結果獲致第三次試驗即達 94. 96 %，與索式萃取 12 hr有相同之總油脂含量，其萃取速率約為索式萃取的 22 倍，顯示最佳化微波萃取參數組合，能有較高之萃取速率。 本研究最終係結合上述試驗所獲致之結果，建置一自動化微波輔助萃取系統，其以中央控制系統進行最佳參數之設定控制，並具連續順序進料、萃取及出料功能，可簡化繁雜之萃取手續及取代人力之操作，且在提高油脂萃取效率下，達到微藻大量萃取生產之目的。摘要	I Abstract	III 目錄	VI 表目錄	XI 圖目錄	XII 符號說明	XIV 1 - 1 前言	 1 1 - 2 研究目的	 3 第二章 文獻探討	 4 2 - 1 產油藻種培養	 4 2 - 1 - 1 微藻培養與油脂累積	 4 2 - 1 - 2 微藻油脂及其應用	 5 2 - 2 微藻油脂萃取	 6 2 - 2 - 1 傳統萃取方式	 6 2 - 2 - 2 萃取溶劑選擇	 7 2 - 3 微波輔助萃取	 9 2 - 3 - 1 微波作用原理	 9 2 - 3 - 2 微波應用	 9 2 - 4 反應曲面法(RESPONSE SURFACE METHODOLOGY, RSM) 	 10 2 - 4 - 1 中心點設計(Center Point Design, CPD) 	 11 2 - 4 - 2 最陡上升法(Path of Steepest Ascent, PSA) 	 11 2 - 4 - 3 中心複合設計(Central Composite Design, CCD) 	 12 第三章 實驗材料與方法	 14 3 - 1 實驗設計與系統設計流程	 14 3 - 2 試驗材料	 15 3 - 3 試驗設備	 15 3 - 4 試驗方法	 17 3 - 4 - 1 檢測方法	 17 3 - 4 - 1 - 1 固液分離方法	 17 3 - 4 - 1 - 2 油脂含量計算方法	 17 3 - 4 - 1 - 3 掃描式電子顯微鏡觀察方法	 17 3 - 4 - 1 - 4 脂肪酸組成分析方法	 18 3 - 4 - 2 索式萃取試驗	 18 3 - 4 - 3 水浴與微波比較試驗	 19 3 - 4 - 3 - 1 萃取時間比較試驗	 19 3 - 4 - 3 - 2 微波萃取次數試驗	 20 3 - 4 - 4 微量分析方式比較試驗	 20 3 - 4 - 5 最佳化參數設計試驗	 21 3 - 4 - 5 - 1 中心點設計試驗	 21 3 - 4 - 5 - 2 常壓與加壓萃取比較試驗	 22 3 - 4 - 5 - 3 最陡上升試驗	 22 3 - 4 - 5 - 4 中心複合設計試驗	 23 3 - 4 - 6 多級萃取試驗	 23 3 - 4 - 7 自動化系統建置與試驗	 24 3 - 4 - 7 - 1 連續進料試驗	 25 3 - 4 - 7 - 2 微波輻射外洩值量測	 25 3 - 4 - 7 - 3 效益評估	 26 第四章 結果與討論	 27 4 - 1 索式萃取試驗結果	 27 4 - 1 - 1 索式萃取油脂含量結果	 27 4 - 1 - 2 索式萃取脂肪酸分析結果	 28 4 - 2 水浴與微波比較試驗結果	 29 4 - 2 - 1 萃取時間比較試驗	 29 4 - 2 - 2 微波萃取次數試驗結果	 31 4 - 3 微量分析方式比較試驗結果	 32 4 - 3 - 1 油脂含量分析結果	 32 4 - 3 - 2 掃描式電子顯微鏡觀察結果	 35 4 - 3 - 3 脂肪酸組成分析	 38 4 - 4 最佳化參數設計試驗結果	 39 4 - 4 - 1 中心點設計試驗結果	 39 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 中心點油脂萃取率試驗結果	 39 4 - 4 - 1 - 2 中心點萃取溫度試驗結果	 43 4 - 4 - 1 - 3 中心點壓力試驗結果	 44 4 - 4 - 2 常壓與加壓萃取比較試驗結果	 46 4 - 4 - 3 最陡上升試驗結果	 47 4 - 4 - 4 中心複合設計試驗結果	 49 4 - 4 - 4 - 1 油脂萃取率試驗結果	 49 4 - 4 - 4 - 2 脂肪酸分析結果	 52 4 - 5 多級萃取試驗結果	 55 4 - 6 自動化系統建置與試驗結果	 56 4 - 6 - 1 連續進料試驗結果	 56 4 - 6 - 2 微波輻射外洩值量測試驗結果	 57 4 - 6 - 3 效益評估	 57 第五章 結論與建議	 58 5 - 1 結論	 58 5 - 2 建議	 61 參考文獻	 6...|$|E

The obtained extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography using a flame photometric detector. Linearity, recovery percentages, relative standard deviations, detection and quantification limits and matrix effects were determined according to DG-SANCO guidelines for both methods. At 0. 2 and 0. 5 mg/kg the evaluated methods showed percentages recoveries between 70 and 120 % {{for most of the}} analytes. Using Microwave <b>Assisted</b> <b>Extraction</b> methodology, 33 pesticide residues could be properly analyzed whereas only 27 could be determined with the proposed modified QuEChERS. All relative standard deviation were below 18 % except for omethoate and disulfoton sulfone when evaluated by the modified QuEChERS. The limits of detection in both methodologies were 0. 2 mg/kg for most of the analyzed compounds. The average detection limit for QuEChERS was 0. 04 mg/kg.

40|$|Three {{different}} extraction {{techniques were}} used for aqueous extraction of anions from soil of the type Ranker that was sampled from a serpentine site. The first technique involved {{the use of a}} rotary mixer (rotary mixer <b>assisted</b> <b>extraction),</b> the second, a microwave digestion <b>system</b> (microwave <b>assisted</b> <b>extraction),</b> with different extraction temperatures for every cycle during the procedure as follows: 50, 100 and 150 °C. An ultrasonic bath (ultrasonic <b>assisted</b> <b>extraction)</b> was used for the last technique in which the durations of the extraction process were: 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 min. The concentrations of inorganic anions in the soil extracts after filtration were determined by ion chromatography. The results showed that the microwave-assisted extraction was highly efficient, giving, at a temperature of 150 °C, several times higher amounts of extracted anions in water than the other two techniques. Moreover, the extracted amounts of anions obtained by means of an ultrasonic bath with an extraction time ranging from 10 to 50 min were similar to those obtained by means of the rotary mixer with an extraction time of 22 h. However, extraction using the rotary mixer was more reliable, since the extracted amounts of anions obtained by means of an ultrasonic bath do not correlate with prolongation of the extraction time...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe drugs {{traditionally}} used {{to treat}} uncomplicated malaria have become ineffective, due {{to the development of}} drug resistance. It has led to a widespread promotion of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) as a strategy for effective management of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The main drawback of the ACTs is their high cost. Hence, many phytoconstituents are currently investigated for their antimalarial activity. One of them is andrographolide of Andrographis paniculata (Burm. f.) Wall. A combination of microwave assisted-extraction and the utilization of hydrotrope as the extraction medium is already proved as a potential safe alternative for the separation of andrographolide. Mathematical models of extraction plays a crucial role in basic research of phytoconstituent separation; they are not yet available for hydrotropic-microwave <b>assisted</b> <b>extraction</b> of andrographolide. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} conduct a scientific study in this field. The mathematical model is a useful engineering tool for equipment optimization, simulation, design and control, allowing theoretical description of the process and evaluation of the kinetic constant. The aim of this work was to model the kinetics of hydrotropic-microwave <b>assisted</b> <b>extraction</b> of andrographolide. The kinetics of hydrotropic-microwave <b>assisted</b> <b>extraction</b> of andrographolide was studied for two different powers of the microwave extractor (10 % and 30 %).
