This early injury interrupts the development of a robust sense of self and of others.

500|$|In 1963, Thurman {{founded the}} Museum of Afro-American History in Boston. Interested in history, she had {{discovered}} a settlement where free blacks had lived prior to the Civil War and their 1808 African Meeting House, which housed both Boston's first black church and the first segregated public school in the United States. The museum was created to save the site and provide a means to purchase other significant properties for preservation of African-American heritage in the area. Thurman also created a map of important African American historical sites in Boston {{with the help of}} her daughter, Anne Chiarenza, which she called [...] "Negro Freedom Trails of Boston". The map highlighted twenty-two points of interest to black history within the city of Boston and was in part created to give black school children <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were part of the history of the city. What is today known as the Black Heritage Trail was adapted from Thurman's original idea.|$|E

500|$|After Rachel and Ross drunkenly {{get married}} while on {{vacation}} in Las Vegas during season five, Schwimmer had initially objected {{to the idea of}} having his character Ross divorce her– his third divorce– because he felt that it was taking it [...] "too far." [...] The actor explained that [...] "The whole arc of the relationship was weird then ... because for [...] {{to be able to move}} on enough to marry someone else and then go back to being in love with Rachel later just went a bit too far." [...] Rachel and Joey's romantic storyline was conceived because the writers wanted to delay Ross and Rachel's reunion further. Crane felt that pairing Rachel and Joey during season ten [...] "was for the greater good" [...] because [...] "It was inappropriate." [...] However, the cast initially protested the idea, fearing that Rachel, Joey, and Ross would ultimately become unlikeable characters and audiences would either [...] "resent Joey for going after a pregnant woman, or resent Rachel for rejecting him, or resent Ross for standing between the two of them." [...] Meanwhile, the writers also approached the concept of Rachel's pregnancy and baby tentatively, worrying about how they would include it in the show because they did not want Friends [...] "to become a show about a baby" [...] while [...] "On the other hand, we don't want to pretend that there isn't one." [...] According to Robert Bianco of USA Today, the critical success and popularity of Rachel's pregnancy is ultimately responsible for [...] "propel the show to the top of the ratings". When it finally came time to write the series finale, [...] "The only thing [...] absolutely knew from very early on was that we had to get Ross and Rachel together," [...] deciding, [...] "We had dicked the audience around for 10 years with their 'will they or won’t they,' and we didn’t see any advantage in frustrating them" [...] any longer. However, at one point the writers had deliberated ending the series with Ross and Rachel in [...] "a gray area of where they aren’t together, but we hint there’s <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might be down the road." [...] Ultimately, Crane and Kauffman relented in favor of giving the audience what they want.|$|E
500|$|The Altar and the Door {{received}} {{positive to}} mixed reviews upon its release. Jared Johnson of Allmusic gave it four-and-a-half {{out of five}} stars, saying it has a [...] "slightly greater dose of rock" [...] and [...] "Casting Crowns gave fans {{no reason to be}} disappointed on Alter [...] ". Deborah Evans-Price of CCM Magazine gave it four out of five stars, commenting that [...] "With this new set, [...] Hall and his companions again deliver songs that are musically engaging and lyrically insightful... Few acts more eloquently capture the complexities of being a Christian in today’s tumultuous world, but these fine folks continue to help light the path for the rest of us". Jennifer E. Jones of cbnmusic.com gave it four out of five spins, opining that [...] "There’s a reason why Casting Crowns {{is one of the best}} Christian bands out today, and that reason is evident when you listen to The Altar and The Door. After three albums, lead singer/songwriter Mark Hall still knows how to speak for those who cannot... The Altar and The Door leaves plenty of room for the sinners and the saints to come closer to Jesus". Mark Lawrence of Cross Rhythms gave the album nine out of ten squares, saying [...] "Traditionally album number three is a defining point in a band's legacy: some bands self implode and produce an album high on production sheen but low on song quality... other bands though go on to produce their masterpiece... The Altar and the Door leans closer to the masterpiece than the flop but leaves you with <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have even greater things to come... The Altar And The Door' is clearly a Casting Crowns album in sound, content and style but this is far from being a negative thing and will appeal to both existing fans as well as draw in new ones". Brian Mansfield gave it two-and-a-half out of four stars, commenting that [...] " [...] concern themselves with the space between the title’s two fixtures– that is, between intention and action, between doing good and getting in the way, or, as one song puts it, between “the God we want and the God who is.” That’s a space worth exploring, and the band’s motives may be the best, but their anthems are as predictable as a televangelist’s tears: start soft, build big, then cue the strings".|$|E
2500|$|Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker {{considered}} Buscemi miscast as {{the central}} figure in the drama. [...] "Buscemi can’t play that kind of character; even {{at the age of}} fifty-two, he looks cagey and restless—not like a guy at the top but like the guy who gets killed when he tries to knock off the guy at the top." [...] The review concludes [...] "Boardwalk Empire” is at great pains to give viewers <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are there, and yet rarely did I feel engrossed in the show. Even if its point is to show you the ugly side of fun, Boardwalk Empire should be much more fun to watch." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rian Thum {{explored}} {{the concepts of}} identity among the ancestors of the modern Uyghurs in Altishahr (the native Uyghur name for eastern Turkestan or southern Xinjiang) before {{the adoption of the}} name [...] "Uyghur" [...] in the 1930s, referring to them by the name [...] "Altishahri" [...] in his article Modular History: Identity Maintenance before Uyghur Nationalism. Thum indicated that Altishahri Turkis did have <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were a distinctive group separate from the Turkic Andijanis to their west, the nomadic Turkic Kirghiz, the nomadic Mongol Qalmaq, and the Han Chinese Khitay before they became known as Uyghurs. There was no single name used by them to refer to themselves, the various native names Altishahris used to refer to themselves were Altishahrlik (Altishahr person), yerlik (local), Turki, and Musulmān (Muslim), the term Musulmān in this situation did not signify religious connotations, because the Altishahris would exclude other Muslim peoples like the Kirghiz when referring to themselves as Musulmān. Dr. Laura J Newby has also noted that the sedentary Altishahri Turkic people felt themselves as a separate group from other Turkic Muslims since at least the 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|Speedball {{is played}} {{in an open}} field that could be {{compared}} to a soccer field, it is flat {{with a minimum of}} natural obstacles, and sometimes artificial turf is used, especially in indoor fields. The first speedball fields were constructed with flat wooden obstacles staked into the ground to provide cover; this concept was further developed into a number of urban-scenario field styles with larger building-like obstacles for casual play, but speedball itself progressed to using smaller obstacles made from plastic drainage pipe, which offered a more variable field layout and some [...] "give" [...] to the obstacles for increased safety. Eventually, inflatable fabric [...] "bunkers" [...] were developed based on common obstacle shapes from previous fields, such as [...] "snake" [...] and [...] "can" [...] bunkers. The use of inflatable obstacles both increases player safety by reducing potential injury from collisions with obstacles, and allows them to be easily moved to reconfigure the field or to set up temporary fields. Tournaments such as the PSP hold different events throughout the summer months all over the United States. Speedball games were originally started as a way to make the game safer for players who might trip on uneven woodland terrain. Speedball is generally a fast-paced game where many more balls are used than in woodsball style games. The Markers used are usually more [...] "High Tech" [...] in <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are controlled by an electronic board and have very high rates of fire(upwards to 20 ball per second).|$|E

They {{could not}} well be much longer absent from Scotland, and yet Lilias had promised the poor Dauphiness not to leave her sisters except in some security. Eleanor's fate was plain enough, Sigismund {{followed}} her about as her betrothed, and the only question was whether, {{during the period of}} mourning, he should go back to his dominions to collect a train worthy of his marriage with a king's daughter; but this he was plainly reluctant to do. Besides the unwillingness of a lover to lose sight of his lady, the catastrophe that had befallen the sisters might well leave <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> needed protection. Perhaps, too, he might expect murmurs at his choice of a dowerless princess from his vassals of the Tirol.|$|E

[...] "It is not only that many youths and students throughout the country are deeply sensitive to the sufferings of the world," [...] she wrote. [...] "They have <b>a</b> keen <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> must be responsible and make a profession of their faith that things do not have to go on as they always have-that men are capable of laying down their lives for others, taking a stand, even when the all-encroaching State and indeed all the world are against them." ...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{evidence}} suggests that political parties in western Europe have been encountering significant (and {{in one or two}} cases severe) problems of public disenchantment. This seems to stem from two broad sources: first, <b>a</b> widespread <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are failing in the performance of some of the classic political functions attributed to them, and second, perceptions of impropriety and undue privilege. This article discusses each of these problems before turning to the question of reform. Although there are no panaceas, the author argues that a number of options are open to parties, including stronger regulatory frameworks, the extension of political education, and enhanced representative and participatory linkages...|$|R
60|$|Behind him came a sunburnt, hardy man, {{wearing the}} white mantle and black fleur-de-lis-pointed cross of the Teutonic Order. A thrill passed through Ebbo's veins as he beheld {{the man who}} to him {{represented}} the murderer of his brother and both his grandfathers, the cruel oppressor of his father, and the perpetrator of many a more remote, but equally unforgotten, injury. And in like manner Sir Dankwart beheld the actual slayer of his father, and the heir of a long score of deadly retribution. No wonder then that, while the Emperor spoke {{a few words of}} salutation and inquiry, gracious though not familiar, the two foes scanned one another with a shiver of mutual repulsing, and <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would fain have fought it out as in the good old times.|$|E
60|$|The spot whereon the {{men stood}} was called 'Down-under-wall;' {{it was a}} nook {{commanding}} a {{full view of the}} bay, and hither the nautical portion of the village unconsciously gravitated on windy afternoons and nights, to discuss past disasters in the reticent spirit induced by <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might at any moment be repeated. The stranger who should walk the shore on roaring and sobbing November eves when there was not light sufficient to guide his footsteps, and muse on the absoluteness of the solitude, would be surprised by a smart 'Good-night' being returned from this corner in company with the echo of his tread. In summer the six or eight perennial figures stood on the breezy side of the wall--in winter and in rain to leeward; but no weather was known to dislodge them.|$|E
60|$|Depressed by forebodings to {{an extent}} which took away {{nearly a third of}} his appetite, he sat down in the parlour of the Old Greyhound to a slice from the family joint of the landlord.

Loveday, who knew little of travelling by land, readily accepted her assurance and resolved to wait.|$|E

50|$|Anomalies in player {{behavior}} can be detected by statistically analyzing game events sent by the client to the server. The great benefit is that this anti-cheat method is that a pure implementation is non-intrusive to the player's privacy and guaranteed to work on all end-user system configurations. The restriction of this method is that it cannot always be clear {{whether or not a}} player is cheating. Highly skilled players can for example develop such <b>a</b> map <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> may end up being flagged for the use of a wallhack and/or aimbot. On the other hand, players may also cheat {{in a way that is}} under the detection thresholds and remain uncaught.|$|R
50|$|Kali for Women was a {{start-up}} feminist publisher in India. Urvashi Butalia and Ritu Menon set up Kali for Women in 1984, arguably the first Indian publishing house dedicated to publishing on and for women. When {{they decided to}} take this step, Butalia had worked with Oxford University Press and Zed Books in Delhi, while Ritu Menon was a scholar. They started with very little capital but with <b>an</b> urgent <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had to make Indian women’s voices heard, through academic publishing and activist works, translation and fiction. They were followed by other Indian presses concerned with gender and social issues such as Bhatkal and Sen who publish the imprints Stree and Samya and Tulika Books.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a natural}} next stage to this, when after all it became {{manifest}} that instead of there being a liberal and reluctant Germany {{at the back of}} imperialism and Junkerdom, there was apparently one solid and enthusiastic people, to suppose that the Germans were in some distinctive way evil, that they were racially more envious, arrogant, and aggressive than the rest of mankind. Upon that supposition a great number of English people settled. They concluded that the Germans had a peculiar devil of their own--and had to be treated accordingly. That was the second stage in the process of national apprehension, and it was marked by the first beginnings of a spy hunt, by the first denunciation of naturalised aliens, and by some anti-German rioting among the mixed alien population in the East End. Most of the bakers in the East End of London were Germans, and for some months after the war began they went on with their trade unmolested. Now many of these shops were wrecked.... It was only in October that the British gave these first signs of <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were fighting not merely political Germany but the Germans.|$|E
60|$|But {{this is most}} unsatisfactory; for {{in giving}} up {{discovery}}, one gives {{up one of the}} highest enjoyments of Natural History. There is a mysterious delight in the discovery of a new species, akin to that of seeing for the first time, in their native haunts, plants or animals of which one has till then only read. Some, surely, who read these pages have experienced that latter delight; and, though they might find it hard to define whence the pleasure arose, know well that it was a solid pleasure, the memory of which they would not give up for hard cash. Some, surely, can recollect, at their first sight of the Alpine Soldanella, the Rhododendron, or the black Orchis, growing upon the edge of the eternal snow, a thrill of emotion not unmixed with awe; <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were, as it were, brought {{face to face with the}} creatures of another world; that Nature was independent of them, not merely they of her; that trees were not merely made to build their houses, or herbs to feed their cattle, as they looked on those wild gardens amid the wreaths of the untrodden snow, which had lifted their gay flowers to the sun year after year since the foundation of the world, taking no heed of man, and all the coil which he keeps in the valleys far below.|$|E
6000|$|He {{disappeared}} {{at times}} for days, when his patient friends understood that her ladyship would naturally absorb him; {{but he always}} {{came back with the}} drollest stories of where he had been, a wonderful picture of society, and even with pretty presents that showed how in absence he thought of his home. Besides giving Mrs. Wix by his conversation <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> almost themselves [...] "went out," [...] he gave her a five-pound note and the history of France and an umbrella with a malachite knob, and to Maisie both chocolate-creams and story-books, besides a lovely greatcoat (which he took her out all alone to buy) and ever so many games in boxes, with printed directions, and a bright red frame for the protection of his famous photograph. The games were, as he said, to while away the evening hour; and the evening hour indeed often passed in futile attempts on Mrs. Wix's part to master what [...] "it said" [...] on the papers. When he asked the pair how they liked the games they always replied [...] "Oh immensely!" [...] but they had earnest discussions as to whether they hadn't better appeal to him frankly for aid to understand them. This was a course their delicacy shrank from; they couldn't have told exactly why, but it was a part of their tenderness for him not to let him think they had trouble. What dazzled most was his kindness to Mrs. Wix, not only the five-pound note and the [...] "not forgetting" [...] her, but the perfect consideration, as she called it with an air to which her sounding of the words gave the only grandeur Maisie was to have seen her wear save on a certain occasion hereafter to be described, an occasion when the poor lady was grander than all of them put together. He shook hands with her, he recognised her, as she said, and above all, more than once, he took her, with his stepdaughter, to the pantomime and, in the crowd, coming out, publicly gave her his arm. When he met them in sunny Piccadilly he made merry and turned and walked with them, heroically suppressing his consciousness of the stamp of his company, a heroism that--needless for Mrs. Wix to sound THOSE words--her ladyship, though a blood-relation, was little enough the woman to be capable of. Even to the hard heart of childhood there was something tragic in such elation at such humanities: it brought home to Maisie the way her humble companion had sidled and ducked through life. But it settled the question {{of the degree to which}} Sir Claude was a gentleman: he was more of one than anybody else in the world--"I don't care," [...] Mrs. Wix repeatedly remarked, [...] "whom you may meet in grand society, nor even to whom you may be contracted in marriage." [...] There were questions that Maisie never asked; so her governess was spared the embarrassment of telling her if he were more of a gentleman than papa. This was not moreover from the want of opportunity, for there were no moments between them at which the topic could be irrelevant, no subject they were going into, not even the principal dates or the auxiliary verbs, in which it was further off than the turn of the page. The answer on the winter nights to the puzzle of cards and counters and little bewildering pamphlets was just to draw up to the fire and talk about him; and if the truth must be told this edifying interchange constituted for the time the little girl's chief education.|$|E

40|$|Using an {{integrated}} social identity and stress and coping approach, I tested {{the ability of}} group identification to foster beliefs in one’s ability to cope successfully that would in turn predict psychological well-being. Black American participants appraised the availability of coping options that varied {{as a function of}} level of identity (individual, intragroup and intergroup) and coping strategy (problem-focused and emotion-focused). Racial group identification positively predicted well-being. Individual emotion-focused and intergroup problem-focused options mediated group identification’s relationship with self-esteem. Individual emotion-focused, intergroup problem-focused and intergroup emotion-focused options mediated the relationship between group identification and life satisfaction. Findings suggest that minority group identification’s relationship with well-being may partly be due to its influence over <b>a</b> person’s <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> and their group can respond effectively to disadvantage...|$|R
