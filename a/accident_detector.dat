40|$|Vehicle Detection System can be {{implemented}} though one or several sensors in an Android Devices – the system can gathers the information provided the device and sends this data to a central database server over a network link. It can work as a instance helping system. This database can only be accessed by authorized third parties, e. g., such as insurance companies or in hospitals. Similarly, describes a system that notifies {{the status of a}} moving object – in terms of location of accident and its positioning – to third parties. This status is notified to hospital if it is having the server or family member or friend who is having that application in his/her android device. In [4], the authors present an automatic emergency alert system for two-wheeled vehicles that includes an <b>accident</b> <b>detector</b> – inclination sensor and decision unit – and a system to inform third parties about historic data of speed, acceleration and braking...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this work {{is the development of}} a fuzzy logic based algorithmic procedure for a reactive highway (arterial) monitoring and incident detection. The research study also aim s at developing a methodology for analyzing time-dependent incident data. Five years of records were gathered and analyzed using data cross tabulation and factorial analysis. A Visual Basic Microscopic Simulation for Incident Modeling (MSIM) is developed to generate time-dependent <b>accident</b> <b>detector</b> data at intersections. MSIM is an abjectbased model that allows for the distribution of various detectors (on each lane) at different locations. MSIM has the ability to model different intersection layouts, traffic control types and timing, link characteristics (speed, number of lanes, etc.) MSIM is utilized to generate various accident scenarios at different accident locations assuming various detector distributions. The detector data are to be utilized in further work to develop the Fuzzy Logic for Incident Detection at Intersections (FL-IDI). An initial design of the FL-IDI was developed using real data replicates (extracted from the detectors on some major freeway). The system’s effectiveness was validated using some real accident data, and the results indicated a false detection rate of about 15 %. 1...|$|E
40|$|Fire {{safety is}} an {{important}} concern in our daily lives and it plays a special role in the human presence in space. In a spacecraft, the outside environment is hostile {{and the opportunity to}} escape is small. Rescue missions are difficult and time consuming. As a result, we should avoid the occurrence of fires in spacecraft as much as possible. If a fire occurs, we need to keep it small and under control. This implies that the materials used on board the spacecraft should be screened carefully, all the machines and devices need to be operated without <b>accident,</b> and fire <b>detectors</b> have to function properly. Once a fire is detected, it can be extinguished quickly and the cabin can be cleaned up to restore operation and sustain life...|$|R
40|$|Recent program {{requirements}} of the US Department of Energy/NNSA {{have led to a}} need for a criticality accident alarm system to be installed at a newly activated facility. The Criticality Safety Group of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) was able to recover and store for possible future use approximately 200 neutron criticality detectors and 20 master alarm panels from the former Rocky Flats Plant in Golden, Colorado when the plant was closed. The Criticality Safety Group participated in a facility analysis and evaluation, the engineering design and review process, as well as the refurbishment, testing, and recalibration of the Rocky Flats criticality alarm system equipment {{to be used in the}} new facility. In order to demonstrate the functionality and survivability of the neutron detectors to the effects of an actual criticality <b>accident,</b> neutron <b>detector</b> testing was performed at the French CEA Valduc SILENE reactor from October 7 to October 19, 2010. The neutron detectors were exposed to three criticality events or pulses generated by the SILENE reactor. The first excursion was performed with a bare or unshielded reactor, and the second excursion was made with a lead shielded/reflected reactor, and the third excursion with a polyethylene reflected core. These tests of the Rocky Flats neutron detectors were performed as a part of the 2010 Criticality Accident Alarm System Benchmark Measurements at the SILENE Reactor. The principal investigators for this series of experiments were Thomas M. Miller and John C. Wagner of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, with Nicolas Authier and Nathalie Baclet of CEA Valduc. Several other organizations were also represented, including the Y- 12 National Security Complex, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, CEA Saclay, and Babcock International Group...|$|R
40|$|Criticality Accident Alarm System (CAAS) {{detectors}} on {{the cell}} floor of the X- 326 process building at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PORTS) are located at a height of 5 m above the cell floor. It {{has been suggested that}} this height be lowered to I m to alleviate accelerated system failures caused by the elevated temperatures at 5 m and to reduce the frequency of injury to maintenance personnel lifting the approximately 90 -lb units into position. Work has been performed which analyzed the effect of relocating the CAAS detectors on the process floors of the X- 333 and X- 330 buildings from their current height to a height of 1 m{sup 1 }. This earlier work was based on criticality accidents occurring in low enriched material (5 % {sup 235 }U) and was limited to the X- 333 and X- 330 buildings and the low enriched areas of X- 326. It did not consider the residual higher enriched material in the X- 326 building. This report analyzes the effect on criticality alarm coverage of lowering the CAAS detectors. This analysis is based on criticality accidents resulting from higher enriched material which may be present as ``hold-up`` in the process equipment within the X- 326 building. The criticality <b>accident</b> alarm <b>detectors</b> at the PORTS facility are set to alarm at a neutron absorbed dose rate of 5 mrad/hr. The calculated absorbed dose rates presented in this report show that the detectors examined that produce an alarm for the given criticality event at their current height will also produce an alarm if located at a height of 1 meter. Therefore, lowering the detectors will not result in a loss of coverage within the building...|$|R
40|$|This project updated and {{deployed}} {{a freeway}} safety performance measurement tool. Freeway safety performance {{is measured by}} estimating the cumulative risk of different accident characteristics. The project built upon a previous research project that developed the core methodology. The tool evaluates the cumulative risk over time of an accident or {{a particular kind of}} accident. The probability is estimated using a model that takes as input only variables that are derived from common inductive loop detectors. The estimated models predict increased risk of any accident occurring, {{as well as a number}} of characteristics of those accidents. The work done in this project included re-estimating the original models using 2007 <b>accident</b> and loop <b>detector</b> data; expanding the input period to use a full year of data; storing raw, intermediate, and final model output in a scalable, web-accessible database; and programming a web-accessible interface to the data. By using this safety performance measurement tool, Caltrans will be able to evaluate the safety impacts of roadway changes over time. Specifically, it is anticipated that new deployments of intelligent transportation systems elements can be evaluated for their safety impacts by comparing the net risk o...|$|R
40|$|Details {{and results}} are {{presented}} of aerial radiometric measurements undertaken in summer 1988 over an area of restricted livestock movement in West Cumbria. The project was planned in June and July {{on the basis of}} discussions between MAFF and SURRC. The prototype aerial spectrometer developed at SURRC in March was used in a helicopter for three purposes. Firstly the sensitivity and spatial resolution attainable over variable and, in some places mountainous, terrain was confirmed, supporting the conclusions of earlier flight trials in Scotland. Secondly it was confirmed that 134 Cs could be detected semi-quantitatively within the survey area, providing insight into the origins of anthropogenic deposition of 137 Cs. Finally the distribution of both natural and anthropogenic gamma ray emitting radioactivity was determined within the survey zone. The survey was conducted successfully in between 22 nd August and 3 rd September 1988. Despite unseasonably poor weather more than 1800 measurements were recorded from an area of over 45000 hectares. The detector performance and sensitivity was as expected, and it has been possible both to detect 134 Cs and to produce high resolution maps of the radioactivity within this area. A comparison of the results of other analyses of environmental materials from parts of the survey area, including a programme undertaken by MAFF in 1988, and the aerial results confirms the overall validity of the calibration method used. Both 134 Cs and 137 Cs maps show considerable spatial variation throughout the survey zone and can be used to identify the areas of peak deposition due to Chernobyl. This basic information may be of use for devising and evaluating agronomic strategies to minimise the transfer of artificial nuclides through the food chain, and to help alleviate the problems experienced by farmers working in the restricted areas since the Chernobyl <b>accident.</b> The prototype <b>detector</b> and method used both show considerable potential for further development...|$|R
