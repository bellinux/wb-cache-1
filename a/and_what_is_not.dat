5|$|In her {{treatment}} of the novel, María Regina Ruiz claims that power gives its wielder {{the ability to make}} prohibitions; prohibitions that are reflected in history, the study of which reveals what is <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> told. The government's actions in The Feast of the Goat demonstrate the discourse of prohibition: foreign newspapers and magazines were prohibited from entering Trujillo's country as they were seen {{as a threat to the}} government's ideas. Mario Vargas Llosa takes part in this discourse by recounting what was prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse are monogamous. The {{breeding}} season usually coincides with {{a crop of}} seeds after the local rainy season and at this time, the feeding flocks tend to break up into pairs. The nesting site is a slight depression in the ground, sometimes lined with {{a few pieces of}} dry foliage. Most typically, three cryptic eggs are laid, though occasionally there may be two or four. Incubation duties are shared and in most species, the males incubate at night while the females sit on the eggs during the day. The eggs usually hatch after 20–25 days. The precocial chicks are covered with down and leave the nest as soon as the last hatchling has dried out. The parents do not provide them with food and they learn, with parental guidance, what is edible <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>not.</b> The chicks obtain their water from the soaked downy feathers on the adults breasts. At first the chicks are too small and young to thermoregulate, and are provided with shade during the hottest part of the day and brooded at night. They remain with their parents, as a family group, for several months.|$|E

The upper middle or professional class constitutes {{the upper end of the}} middle class which consists of highly educated, well-paid professionals with considerable work autonomy. The lower end of the middle class – called either lower middle class or just middle class – consists of semi-professionals, craftsmen, office staff, and sales employees who often have college degrees and are very loosely supervised.|$|E

50|$|The {{government}} of East Germany had {{control over a}} large number of military and paramilitary organisations through various ministries.

Because of East Germany's proximity to the West during the Cold War (1945-91), its military forces were among the most advanced of the Warsaw Pact. Defining <b>what</b> <b>was</b> a military force <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>is</b> a matter of some dispute.|$|R
25|$|Though often counted {{among the}} various {{carnivorous}} plants, {{with the exception of}} Heliamphora tatei, the vast majority of plants in the genus Heliamphora do not produce their own digestive enzymes (i.e. proteases, ribonucleases, phosphatases, etc.), relying instead on the enzymes of symbiotic bacteria to break down their prey. They do, however, attract prey through special visual and chemical signals and trap and kill the prey through a typical pitfall trap. Field studies of H. nutans, H. heterodoxa, H. minor, and H. ionasi have determined that none of these species produce their own proteolytic enzymes. If production of these enzymes was used as a strict demarcation of what is <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a carnivorous plant, many of the Heliamphora species would not meet the requirement. H. tatei {{is one of the few}} species observed to produce both digestive enzymes and wax scales, which also aid in prey capture. The pattern of carnivory among Heliamphora species, combined with habitat data, indicates that carnivory in this genus evolved in nutrient-poor locations as a means to improve absorption of available nutrients. Most Heliamphora typically capture ants, while H. tateis improvements on the design allow it to capture and absorb nutrients from more flying insects. The carnivorous habit among these species is lost in low light conditions, which suggests that certain nutrient concentrations (specifically nitrogen and phosphorus) are only limiting during periods of fast growth under normal light conditions, thus rendering most of the carnivorous adaptations inefficient and not energy cost effective.|$|E
500|$|Cisneros {{breaks the}} {{boundary}} between what is a socially acceptable way for women to act and speak <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> using language and imagery that have a [...] "boisterous humor" [...] and [...] "extrovert energy" [...] and are even at times [...] "deliberately shocking". Not all readers appreciate this [...] "shocking" [...] quality of some of Cisneros’s work. Both female and male readers have criticized Cisneros for the ways she celebrates her sexuality, such as the suggestive photograph of herself on the My Wicked, Wicked Ways cover (3rd Woman Press, 1987). Cisneros says of this photo: [...] "The cover is of a woman appropriating her own sexuality. In some ways, that’s also why it’s wicked: the scene is trespassing that boundary by saying 'I defy you. I'm going to tell my own story.'" [...] Some readers [...] "failed to perceive the transgressive meaning of the gesture", thinking that she was merely being lewd for shock value, and questioned her legitimacy as a feminist. Cisneros’s initial response to this was dismay, but then she reports thinking [...] "Wait a second, where’s your sense of humor? And why can’t a feminist be sexy?" ...|$|E
500|$|Fouad Ajami criticised Aflaq {{for a lack}} of real substance, stating, [...] "Nearly {{three hundred}} pages of text yield no insight, on his part, into what went wrong and what needed to be done; there is only the visible infatuation with words" [...] and [...] "Aflaq summons the party to renounce power and go back to its 'pure essence'". There is some truth in this critique. Aflaq spent much time and energy writing optimistically about the future, and the past, of the Arab Nation, and of how the Arab World could be unified. As Kanan Makiya, the author of Republic of Fear: The Politics of Modern Iraq, notes: for [...] "Aflaq, reality is {{confined}} to the inner world of the party." [...] In contrast to other philosophers, such as Karl Marx or John Locke, Aflaq's ideological view of the world makes no clear stand on the materialistic or socioeconomic behavior of humanity. While other philosophers make distinctions between what is real <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> real, that is between prescriptive and descriptive analysis, [...] Aflaq did not as a rule define what is and what ought to be. [...] In his thought both are molded into the same category: that which is attainable.|$|E
