25|$|Nietzsche {{claimed the}} death of God would {{eventually}} lead {{to the loss of}} any universal perspective on things, and along with it any coherent sense of objective truth. Nietzsche himself rejected the idea of objective reality, arguing that knowledge is contingent and conditional, relative to various fluid perspectives or interests. This leads to constant reassessment of rules (i.e., those of philosophy, the scientific method, etc.) <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> of individual perspectives. This view has acquired the name perspectivism.|$|E

Light simultaneously possesses the characteristics of both waves and particles, each being manifested <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances.</b> The effect was impossible to understand in terms of the classical wave description of light, as the energy of the emitted electrons did not depend on the intensity of the incident radiation. Classical theory predicted that the electrons would 'gather up' energy over a period of time, and then be emitted.|$|E

Schedule 21 of the Act sets out [...] "minimum terms" [...] (a term further defined in section 269(2)) for those convicted of murder. The terms {{are in the}} form of standard [...] "starting points" [...] based on age and other factors, from which any increase or decrease is then made by the sentencing judge <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>circumstances</b> of the crime and the offender. [...] "Aggravating and mitigating factors" [...] are also set out, which can cause the sentencing judge to adjust the sentence from the starting point. Under the 2003 act, the starting points are simply starting points - judges are then free to decide a minimum term of any length or a [...] "whole life" [...] sentence if they feel it appropriate. However they must explain the reason for the sentence and for any changes from the starting point.|$|E
