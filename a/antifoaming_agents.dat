40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) at the Savannah River Site is {{responsible}} for immobilizing high level radioactive waste (HLW) as glass-filled steel canisters for permanent storage. In the DWPF facility, the HLW sludge undergoes chemical treatment to prepare it for vitrification in a melter. The generation of stable foams is possible during treatment. The current DWPF antifoam is ineffective in preventing and minimizing the formation of foam. The adverse consequences of excess foam can be severe enough to cause foam to exit the evaporator and collect in the condensate. A foamover will contaminate the relatively clean condensate with HLW solids. It can also potentially lead {{to the production of}} an unsuitable melter feed that would not make quality glass. Both of these consequences are costly and time consuming to correct. A new <b>antifoam</b> <b>agent</b> was developed by the Illinois Institute of Technology, IIT, for DWPF in an attempt to minimize or eliminate the frequency of these foamovers. This <b>antifoam</b> <b>agent</b> was demonstrated to be superior to the existing DWPF <b>antifoam</b> <b>agent</b> in laboratory scale experiments. However, the DWPF evaporation heat flux was not achievable in the laboratory scale equipment. A 1 / 240 th-scale pilot facility was built to achieve this heat flux and determine whether the existing or new <b>antifoam</b> <b>agent</b> was superior. The pilot facility was built out of glass to allow observation of the foam formation during processing. The experiments used a non-radioactive simulant slurry similar to HLW. The IIT <b>antifoam</b> <b>agent</b> was found to be much more effective than the DWPF antifoam at the current conditions of maximum foam formation.

One of these products is base apple wine, which is used for the production of cider and mulled wine and also is sold to other producers of cider. A foaming problem has occurred at some customers when the cider is bottled, and this problem has been traced to the base wine. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate what causes the foaming and how the foaming is affected by the clarifying agents used during the production of the wine. An investigation whether silica based <b>antifoaming</b> <b>agents</b> might be a solution of the problem will be performed. During the work fermentations, clarification and foaming tests will be performed in laboratory scale in Kivik. Tests with four different silica based antifoaming compounds are carried out and on these samples the surface tension and viscosity are measured to see how these factors correlate with the foaming when <b>antifoaming</b> <b>agents</b> are added to the wine. What is more, fermentations with a new yeast type and fermentations with less fruit are made to investigate if this could give better foaming properties in the wine. The tests showed that it is probably proteins that are the main cause of the foaming, but an increase of the amount of bentonite, the clarifying agent reducing protein content in the wine, is not possible since this causes too much sediment. <b>Antifoaming</b> <b>agents</b> gave reduced foaming times, which were at an acceptable level, but when the wine was mixed to cider base and filtered the effect was lost.

In this study we characterised, for the first time, the effects of five commonly-used <b>antifoaming</b> <b>agents</b> on the total amount of recombinant green fluorescent protein (GFP) secreted from shake-flask cultures of this industrially-relevant yeast. Results Addition of defined concentrations of Antifoam A (Sigma), Antifoam C (Sigma), J 673 A (Struktol), P 2000 (Fluka) or SB 2121 (Struktol) to shake-flask cultures of P. pastoris increased the total amount of recombinant GFP in the culture medium (the total yield) {{and in the case of}} P 2000, SB 2121 and J 673 A almost doubled it. When normalized to the culture density, the GFP specific yield (μg OD 595 - 1) was only increased for Antifoam A, Antifoam C and J 673 A. Whilst none of the antifoams affected the growth rate of the cells, addition of P 2000 or SB 2121 was found to increase culture density. There was no correlation between total yield, specific yield or specific growth rate and the volumetric oxygen mass transfer coefficient (k L a) in the presence of antifoam. Moreover, the antifoams did not affect the dissolved oxygen concentration of the cultures. A comparison of the amount of GFP retained in the cell by flow cytometry with that in the culture medium by fluorimetry suggested that addition of Antifoam A, Antifoam C or J 673 A increased the specific yield of GFP by increasing the proportion secreted into the medium. Conclusions We show that addition of a range of <b>antifoaming</b> <b>agents</b> to shake flask cultures of P. pastoris increases the total yield of the recombinant protein being produced. This is not only a simple method to increase the amount of protein in the culture, but our study also provides insight into how antifoams interact with microbial cell factories. Two mechanisms are apparent: one group of antifoams (Antifoam A, Antifoam C and J 673 A) increases the specific yield of GFP by increasing the total amount of protein produced and secreted per cell, whilst the second (P 2000 or SB 2121) increases the total yield by increasing the density of the culture. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} several <b>antifoaming</b> <b>agents</b> by {{inhalation}} in preventing paroxysmal pulmonary edema was {{tested in a}} series of rabbits. Three single agents (silicone aerosol, freon, and ethyl alcohol vapor) proved beneficial; their combination did not enhance the beneficial effect. A new agent (silicone aerosol) and a new combination (10 per cent ether in alcohol by aerosol) are now ready for clinical triiil. A NTIFOAMING agents in paroxysmal / % pulmonary edema were advocated in J. A. 1950 by one of us (A. A. L.) following animal experimentation. 1 Several substances having effect on surface tension were tested in-cluding ether, octyl alcohol, capryl alcohol, sorbitan trioleate, and ethyl alcohol. Pulmonary edema was induced in rabbits by intravenous injection of epinephrine while the various sub-stances were administered by inhalation by means of an atomizer. Further experiments were conducted in ex-perimental pulmonary edema of the rat caused by intraperitoneal injection of thiourea, in pul-monary edema of the guinea pig caused by ingestion of ammonium chloride, and in pulmo-nary edema of the dog caused by rapid intra-carotid infusion of physiologic salt solution. 2 The general conclusion was that the heavy alcohols failed to develop any favorable effect, that ether had a moderate beneficial action, and that ethyl alcohol exerted an important favorable effect. This effect was attributed to modification of the surface tension of the foam followed by decrease of its volume and better oxygenation of the lungs. As systemic effects of the inhaled alcohol vapor were minimal, the method was particularly indicated for patients with pulmonary edema in shock or for those who might develop this syndrome.
