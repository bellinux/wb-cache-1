Thus, enlargement was no longer a question of if, but when and how.

2500|$|Whilst {{citizens}} of all Member States of the European Union and Schengen <b>associated</b> <b>countries</b> {{are entitled to}} use the eVisitor system since 27 October 2008, the European Commission is still assessing whether the eVisitor visa fully satisfies reciprocity requirements. In its [...] Seventh report on certain third countries' maintenance of visa requirements in breach {{of the principle of}} reciprocity from 2012, the European Commission found that in principle, the eVisitor provides equal treatment of the {{citizens of}} all Member States and Schengen <b>associated</b> <b>countries.</b> However, while the average autogrant rate was high (86.36%), the quarterly reports on eVisitor application statistics showed that applications by citizens of some Member States are mainly processed manually. Autogrant rates for Bulgaria and Romania were at just 18% and 23%, as the majority of applications were sent for additional examination. The Commission therefore engaged to continue to closely monitor the processing of eVisitor applications. The Commission would submit its assessment of whether eVisitor is equivalent to the Schengen visa application process in a separate document in parallel with the assessment of the Final Rule on ESTA. Currently the Schengen Area does not have visa requirements in place for short-term stays of Australian nationals. The United Kingdom and Ireland are exempt from this particular EU policy, but still do not impose any short-term visa requirements on Australians.|$|E

Many Brazilian members of government have spoken out for the Bahá'ís as early as April 2008. [...] From the United States, representative Frank R. Wolf stated he was deeply disturbed about the systematic persecution of the Bahá'ís witnessed through the announced trial. [...] Later congressman Mark Kirk of Illinois offered a resolution {{on the subject of}} the trial condemning the government of Iran for its state-sponsored persecution of its Bahá'í minority; the resolution was co-sponsored by other Representatives. A Senatorial resolution has been introduced by Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, cosponsored by Sam Brownback, Kansas; Robert Menendez, New Jersey; Olympia Snowe, Maine; and Sheldon Whitehouse, Rhode Island. In Canada, Deepak Obhrai, Canadian Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, found the announcement of the trial very troubling, which was echoed by Lawrence Cannon, Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs. In Germany, German chairman of the CSU Group in the Bundestag, Peter Ramsauer stated that he had [...] "deep concern". In the United Kingdom, British Foreign Office Minister Bill Rammell also expressed concern over the trial. The Presidency of the European Union (EU), with the support of the EU <b>associated</b> <b>countries</b> denounced the trial, which was echoed by the President of the European Parliament. In Australia, the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade spoke to the subject, as did Mark Weitzman, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s Task Force Against Hate. In the Netherlands, Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Maxime Verhagen said the Netherlands was seriously concerned, fears that the trial will not be fair and has asked for an independent observer. The Canadian Parliamentary Sub-Committee on Human Rights has adopted a strongly worded motion February 24 which was forwarded to the full committee on the 26th. On the same day the UK Board of Deputies president, Henry Grunwald QC, has written to Foreign Secretary David Miliband with a renewed call to the government to support the persecuted Bahá’i community in Iran. Repeating steps taken in 2006 following the UN Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Religion reports of the time, in April 2009 the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Lower House of the Spanish Congress of Deputies unanimously approved a resolution concerning the [...] "systematic" [...] persecution being exerted on the Bahá'í community. In May 2009 a motion from the Australian House of Representatives expressed [...] "serious concern" [...] there was no access to legal representation or due legal process, that charges of [...] "spying, insulting religious sanctities, and propaganda against the Islamic Republic, and that these charges could attract the death penalty". The Representatives rose in motion calling on Iran [...] "to respect rights to freedom of religion and the peaceful exercise of freedom of expression and association, in accordance with international human rights conventions" [...] and [...] "to release the seven Baha’i detainees without delay." [...] Six members of Parliament from both major parties spoke in support of the motion: Leichhardt Turnour, Cowan Simpkins, Hindmarsh Georganas, O’Connor Turckey, Isaacs Dreyfus, and Longman Sullivan. Members of the German Bundestag, partisan speakers Erika Steinbach MP (CDU/CSU), Christoph Strässer MP (SPD), Volker Beck MP (B90/DIE GRÜNEN) and chairman Burkhardt Müller-Sönksen MdB (FDP) united in issuing a joint declaration demanding [...] "the immediate and unconditional release of the leaders of the Baha’i religious community." ...|$|E
