25|$|Wright {{expressed}} the following sentiments regarding the CLMC death threat {{in an interview}} he conducted with journalist Emer Woodful in late August 1996:My {{heart goes out to}} my family <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> this. Well, if you think you're right, then you're right. Although I have done nothing wrong except express an opinion that's the prevalent opinion of the people of Northern Ireland and I will always do that, dear, no matter what the price. Well, I've been prepared to die for long many a year. I don't wish to die, {{but at the end of}} the day no one will force their opinions down my throat – no one.|$|E
25|$|President Eisenhower did {{not want}} to fly American U-2 pilots over the Soviet Union because he felt that if one of these pilots were to be shot down or {{captured}} that it could be seen as an act of aggression. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> the Cold War, any act of aggression could spark open conflict between the two countries. In order to ease the burden of flying Americans into Soviet airspace the idea developed to have British pilots from the Royal Air Force fly these missions in place of the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). With the United Kingdom still reeling from the aftermath of the Suez Crisis and in no position to snub American requests, the British government was amenable to the proposal. Using British pilots allowed Eisenhower {{to be able to use}} the U-2 plane to see what the Soviet Union was hiding, while still being able to plausibly deny any affiliation if a mission became compromised.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1960s, Baez began writing many of her own songs, {{beginning}} with [...] "Sweet Sir Galahad" [...] and [...] "A Song For David," [...] both songs appearing on her 1970 (I Live) One Day at a Time album; [...] "Sweet Sir Galahad" [...] was written about her sister Mimi's second marriage while [...] "A Song For David" [...] was a tribute to Harris. One Day <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>Time,</b> <b>like</b> David's Album, featured a decidedly country sound.|$|E

2500|$|News of {{casualties}} {{suffered by the}} British Expeditionary Force in Belgium was already turning the public mood against [...] "business as usual" [...] and on 27 August a letter written by W.G. Grace was published in The Sportsman in which he declared that [...] "I think the time has arrived when the county cricket season should be closed, for it is not fitting <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> this that able-bodied men should be playing cricket by day and pleasure-seekers look on. I should like to see all first-class cricketers of suitable age {{set a good example}} and come to the help of their country without delay in its hour of need." ...|$|E
2500|$|Both Harper and Dion {{addressed}} {{the nation on}} December 3, 2008, with televised statements broadcast on Canada's major television networks. Harper's five-minute pre-recorded statement, televised nationally in English and French at 7 pm Eastern Time (ET), outlined the steps the government had taken to address the economic crisis and attacked the Liberals for forming a coalition with the Bloc Québécois. Harper said: [...] "at a time of global economic instability, Canada's government must stand unequivocally for keeping the country together. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> this, a coalition with the separatists cannot help Canada. And the opposition {{does not have the}} democratic right to impose a coalition with the separatists they promised voters would never happen." [...] The press noted that while he used the word sovereigntist in the French version of his speech, Harper used separatist in English.|$|E
2500|$|Clark, Vines, and Harlan {{whispered the}} {{password}} to viewers {{on the first}} two versions of the show, but the practice was discontinued, beginning with Password All-Stars, when a computer (referred to as [...] "Murphy" [...] on-camera by Allen Ludden) was incorporated; it would display the password, one letter <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> (<b>like</b> a typewriter), followed by the quotation marks. A beeping sound would accompany each letter as it appeared on the screen. A final beep would signal that the password was revealed to the home viewer, and play would start. On Password Plus, a bell would ring when the password was revealed. On Super Password from September 24, 1984 to October 31, 1986, a chirping sound was heard when the password was revealed. However, Gene Wood began whispering the words on Super Password just like in the original, starting on November 3, 1986. The practice was again discontinued on Million Dollar Password.|$|E

Aircraft generally carried enough MW 50 for about two ten-minute periods of use, allowing them to increase their climb rate and level speed in combat for interception missions.|$|R
50|$|A Tournament Organizer (TO) {{is someone}} who runs tournaments for their local community. Usually, he or she runs them within a weekly or monthly basis <b>at</b> <b>a</b> local store.

2500|$|On 28 May, {{they heard}} that the Belgian army was surrendering. [...] General Réquin spoke to Mrs Spears and {{emphasised}} the serious of the military situation. She received telephone calls from Paris – her husband wanted {{her to come to}} Paris before he flew to London. [...] She resisted – how could she leave her unit <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>like</b> this? [...] Spears was insistent but she was reluctant, as was Captain Gosset, who feared the road might be cut and that she would be unable to get back. [...] They heard that Dunkirk had been evacuated. [...] Then Spears rang again – this time ordering her to come to Paris. [...] She decided to make a dash to the capital and back. [...] They met at the British embassy. [...] With the French army collapsing on all fronts, Spears was exhausted. 'His eyes were bloodshot. [...] There were lines inches deep in his face. [...] I saw for one second what was going to happen. [...] The war leapt at me out of his eyes. [...] I was terrified.' ...|$|E

50|$|Prepared {{statements}} take {{an ordinary}} statement or query and parameterize {{it so that}} different literal values can be used <b>at</b> <b>a</b> later <b>time.</b> <b>Like</b> stored procedures, they are stored on the server for efficiency and provide some protection from SQL injection attacks. Although simpler and more declarative, prepared statements are not ordinarily written to use procedural logic and cannot operate on variables. Because of their simple interface and client-side implementations, prepared statements are more widely reusable between DBMS.|$|R
5000|$|DAT {{could only}} record 2 tracks of audio for stereo <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> PCM adaptor, but the smaller {{size of the}} {{equipment}} and media, {{as well as being}} able to accept multiple sampling rates (the standard 44.1 kHz, as well as 48 kHz, and 32 kHz, all at 16 bits per sample, and a special [...] "LP" [...] recording mode using 12 bits per sample at 32 kHz for extended recording time) gave DAT many advantages over PCM adaptor-based systems.|$|R
25|$|The {{presence}} of two shelled eggs within the birth canal shows that oviraptorosaurs were intermediate between the reproductive biology of crocodilians and modern birds. Like crocodilians, {{they had two}} oviducts. However, crocodilians produce multiple shelled eggs per oviduct <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> whereas oviraptorosaurs, <b>like</b> birds, produced only one egg per oviduct <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{cold wind}} that blew across Belgium brought snow flakes {{and then a}} heavy fall within moments of the race starting. (...) Riders {{struggled}} on, with hands to faces to keep {{a view of the}} road. The race was an anonymous mass of plastic jackets and windcheaters. Spectators stood in goggles like upmarket snowmen, red-faced in the bitterness. Within the hour some teams had barely a man left on the road. They pulled out two dozen <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> men <b>like</b> Gibi Baronchelli and Giuseppe Saronni, Lucien Van Impe and Jean-René Bernaudeau.|$|R
50|$|The {{next step}} was cinema. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when stalwarts <b>like</b> K. Raghavan, G. Devarajan and M. S.

50|$|Kumonga {{can shoot}} a spider web and deploy a poison stinger {{from between the}} Chelicerae, and boasts prehensile pedipalps {{that can be used}} to grab small prey. The Showa version was able to survive {{multiple}} direct hits from Godzilla's atomic breath. The Millennium Kumonga's web was able to expand on contact with air from a single thread into a net for incapacitating foes. See Scytodidae for a real-world example of a spider which can spit webbing similar to Kumonga. In addition, the Millennium version was able to leap hundreds of meters <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> much <b>like</b> <b>a</b> jumping spider (Salticidae).|$|R
60|$|He didn’t even {{lift his}} hat {{to look up}} at the Bell tower {{when he came to the}} old church on his return.

He knew, too, that the Chimes would ring immediately; and that they sounded to his fancy, <b>at</b> such <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> <b>like</b> voices in the clouds. But he only made the more haste to deliver the Alderman’s letter, and get out of the way before they began; for he dreaded to hear them tagging ‘Friends and Fathers, Friends and Fathers,’ to the burden they had rung out last.|$|R
