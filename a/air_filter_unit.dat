However, the importance and performance evaluation of <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> have not been well publicized and related scientific reports are scarce. In this study, a transportable, off-line, air filter-testing unit (the Unit) was designed and utilized to simulate the filter housing of a mechanical ventilation system. The Unit was designed, assembled, and operated in a laboratory. To demonstrate the applications of the Unit, a series of <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> handling and installation scenarios was performed to determine the characteristic curve and capture efficiencies of a selected set of HEPA filters. The research project produced a transportable, closed system <b>air</b> <b>filter</b> testing <b>unit.</b> The Unit incorporated a fan, a damper to adjust air flowrate, a filter-housing (consisting of a mixing chamber, a filter-frame, and a pressure-gauge), and ducting with ports to introduce challenge particles and monitor them after filtration.

40|$|Abstract—In {{multimedia}} stream filtering scenario, there usually exist many filtering {{rules that}} specify the filtering objectives and many <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> that estimate the filtering rules. A filtering rule may connect to several different <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> and a <b>filtering</b> <b>unit</b> may connect to several different filtering rules. An open problem {{in such a}} filtering scenario is how to order the <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> in an optimal sequence so as to decrease the filtering cost. Existing methods {{are based on a}} greedy strategy which orders the <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> according to three factors of the <b>filtering</b> <b>units,</b> i. e., the selectivity, popularity, and cost. Although all these methods reported good results, there is still one important problem that hasn’t been addressed yet. The selectivity factor is set empirically, which is unable to adaptively adjust with stream passing by. Under these observations, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive ordering framework (AOF) which executes an adaptive ordering strategy. In AOF, all the temporal filtering results are preserved in each sliding window. Accordingly, the selectivity can adjust automatically and thus all the <b>filtering</b> <b>units</b> can be ordered with respect to the adapted selectivity. Experiments on both synthetic and real life multimedia streams demonstrate that our AOF method outperforms other simple filtering methods.

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>filter</b> {{manufacturers}} have recently begun marketing premium <b>air</b> <b>filters</b> that provide very high particle capture efficiencies with very low initial static pressure drops.
