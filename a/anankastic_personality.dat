50|$|She is {{also the}} title of a science fiction short story by Stanisław Lem, in the series of the Tales of Pirx the Pilot. Ananke, used in the meaning of force and {{obsession}} (<b>Anankastic</b> <b>personality</b> disorder), {{is the key to the}} solution of a disastrous spaceship accident.|$|E
5000|$|In 1908, Sigmund Freud named what is {{now known}} as {{obsessive-compulsive}} or <b>anankastic</b> <b>personality</b> disorder [...] "anal retentive character". He identified the main strands of the personality type as a preoccupation with orderliness, parsimony (frugality), and obstinacy (rigidity and ness). The concept fits his theory of psychosexual development.|$|E
50|$|Using such methods, Baumann {{assisted}} two people, {{one with}} an <b>anankastic</b> <b>personality</b> and a heavily depressed woman. Because of this, the public prosecution office in Basel accused him of “vermutete Beihilfe zum Suizid aus selbstsüchtigen Motiven“ (supposed suicide assistance with egoistic motive). By the end of 2002, the Society of Zurich Physicians ("Zürcher Ärztegesellschaft") sought to prevent Baumann from continuing with his work, but having {{reached the end of}} his career, he left the society. He also left the Zurich Society for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy ("Zürcher Gesellschaft für Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie").|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper the {{evidence}} for Field Marshal Montgomery having Asperger's syndrome is examined. Biographies of Montgomery were examined to search for evidence that he met criteria for Asperger's syndrome - Gillberg (1991) and Asperger's disorder (APA. 1994) and <b>Anankastic</b> <b>personality</b> disorder (WHO, 1992). He demonstrates a qualitative impairment in social interaction and restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests and activities. It can be concluded that he met criteria for Asperger's disorder DSM-IV (APA. 1994) ...|$|E
40|$|Stuttering is {{frequently}} associated with negative consequences which typically begin in early childhood. Despite this, no {{previous studies have}} investigated the presence of personality disorders among adults who stutter. Therefore, {{the aims of the}} present study were to screen for personality disorders among adults who stutter, and to compare these screening estimates with matched controls from a national population sample. Using a matched case-control design, participants were 94 adults seeking treatment for stuttering, 92 of whom completed the International Personality Disorders Examination Questionnaire (IPDEQ) as a first-stage screener, and 920 age- and gender-matched controls from the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Well-Being (ANSMHWB). A conditional logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratios for the primary outcome: first-stage presence of any personality disorder; as well as specific personality disorders. Based on first-stage screening, the presence of any personality disorder was significantly higher for adults in the stuttering group than matched controls, demonstrating almost threefold increased odds. This difference between groups remained significant for all specific personality disorders, with four- to sevenfold increased odds found for Dissocial, Anxious, Borderline, Dependent and Paranoid personality disorders, and two- to threefold increased odds found for Histrionic, Impulsive, Schizoid and <b>Anankastic</b> <b>personality</b> disorders. In conclusion, stuttering appears to be associated with a heightened risk for the development of personality disorders. These results highlight the need for research regarding the assessment and treatment of personality disorders among adults who stutter. Educational objectives: The reader will be able to: (1) describe the nature of personality disorders, including factors thought to contribute to their development; (2) identify some of the negative consequences associated with stuttering which may {{contribute to the development of}} personality disorders among adults who stutter; (3) describe the process involved in screening for personality disorders, including various methods of scoring; and (4) summarize findings regarding the first-stage presence of personality disorders among adults seeking speech treatment for stuttering in the present sample in comparison with age- and gender-matched controls from a national population sample. 14 page(s...|$|E
