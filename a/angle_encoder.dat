The systematic nature of the error profile for each of the encoders has also been validated by repeated calibration of the encoders {{over a period of time}} and it was found that the error profiles of a particular encoder recorded at different epochs show near reproducible behavior. The ANN-based error compensation procedure has been implemented for 4 encoders by training the ANN with their respective error profiles and the results indicate that the accuracy of encoders can be improved by nearly an order of magnitude from quoted values of ~ 6 arc-min to ~ 0. 65 arc-min when their corresponding ANN-generated weight files are used for determining the corrected <b>encoder</b> <b>angle.</b> Comment: 16 pages, 4 figures.

These changes are measured by shaft encoders and are used in the control of camera positions. Dankers et al. developed an online calibration process for the CeDAR head [14]. Their work was built on static system rectification [15], where the perspective projection matrix (PPM) found by the standard calibration process for the left and right cameras was used to locate the mapping between the two images. The PPM was decomposed, and a new PPM and transformation between the left and right images were used to make the epipolar line parallel to the baseline. Dankers et al. modified the algorithm so that the rotating angle of the left and right images was replaced by the <b>angle</b> of the <b>encoder</b> of each camera [14]. Both the motor angle and the image were captured at the same time.

The device {{is based on a}} double air bearing structure embedding a continuously rotating encoder, which is read by two heads: one fixed {{to the base of the}} comparator and a second fixed to the upper moving part of the comparator. The phase measurement between the two heads’ signals is proportional to the relative angle suspended between them (and, therefore, the angle between the base and the upper, movable part of the comparator). The advantage of this solution is to reduce the encoder graduation errors and to cancel the cyclic errors due to the interpolation of the encoder lines. By using only two pairs of reading heads, we have achieved an intrinsic accuracy of ± 0. 04 ″ (rectangular distribution) that can be reduced through self-calibration. The residual cyclic errors have shown to be less than 0. 01 ″ peak-to-peak. The random fluctuations are less than 0. 01 ″ rms on a 100 s time interval.

SelfA (Self-calibratable <b>Angle</b> device) rotary <b>encoder</b> {{can detect}} {{some kinds of}} angle error, not only its encoder scale error, but also the encoder {{attachment}} error (e. g. eccentricity error).

However, {{in the case of}} the SelfA using the encoder of 36, 000 graduation scales, since the angular interval of the calibrated main scales corresponds to 36 ", it is insufficient for high resolution angular indexing control with high accuracy. Generally, the angle error of electric interpolation signal is estimated to be 1 % of main scale resolution that corresponds to about 0. 36 " for 36, 000 scales encoder.

It is assumed that the accuracy of this point clouds is considerably higher than that from the multi-beam LIDAR and that the data represent faces of man-made objects at different distances.

As presently implemented, the antenna beam is scanned about the received signal direction by physical movement of the antenna. While straightforward, this approach has at least two disadvantages. Firstly, because of structural distortions, finite <b>angle</b> <b>encoder</b> resolution, and drive servo response, the actual antenna beam direction only approximates the commanded beam direction. Secondly, because of the large mass moved during scan, the rate of scan is severely restricted.

Both of these disadvantages would be alleviated in an inertialess conscan system in which the beam scanning was performed electronically.
