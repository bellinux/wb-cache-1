5|$|The {{survivors}} told Coast Guard {{officials that}} during the storm, one of the engines of the plane failed, along {{with most of the}} electrical power; as a result, the crew was unable to drop the reserve tank or close the bomb bay doors automatically. Before the crew could close the bomb bay doors manually, the plane crashed in shark-infested waters and broke apart; three of the crewmen were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the downed plane, but the other seven were unable to escape. The three survivors were then attacked by sharks before being rescued.|$|E
5|$|Felipe Massa {{tried to}} make up places after his pit lane-start, but was caught in midfield battles. He went into the pit lane {{simultaneously}} with Felipe Nasr in front and Pastor Maldonado behind him. A swift stop by the Lotus pit crew meant that Maldonado was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> ahead and gain two positions. Sauber driver Marcus Ericsson was running eighth {{when he came into}} the pit lane on lap 26. A 27-second pit stop due to problems with the front left tyre meant that he fell out of reach for a points finish. Carlos Sainz Jr. retired from the race right after exiting pit lane on lap 30, due to an issue with his front left wheel. His Toro Rosso teammate Max Verstappen joined him on the sidelines on lap 34 due to an electrical failure.|$|E

5|$|Soon after Kaganovich {{arrived in}} Kiev, Khrushchev fell ill, and was barely seen until September 1947. In his memoirs, Khrushchev {{indicates}} he had pneumonia; some biographers have theorized that Khrushchev's illness was entirely political, {{out of fear}} that his loss of position was the first step towards downfall and demise. However, Khrushchev's children remembered their father as having been seriously ill. Once Khrushchev was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of bed, he and his family took their first vacation since before the war, to a beachfront resort in Latvia. Khrushchev, though, soon broke the beach routine with duck-hunting trips, and a visit to newly Soviet Kaliningrad, where he toured factories and quarries. By the end of 1947, Kaganovich had been recalled to Moscow and the recovered Khrushchev had been restored to the First Secretaryship. He then resigned the Ukrainian premiership in favor of Demyan Korotchenko, Khrushchev's protégé.|$|E
5|$|Before Maria's arrival, {{tropical}} storm watches were issued {{for most of}} the Lesser Antilles on September8; the watches were upgraded to {{tropical storm}} warnings at 2230UTC. On the following day, Puerto Rico and many of the U.S. Virgin Islands and British Virgin Islands were placed under a tropical storm watch. The watches and warnings for the islands were discontinued around 1500UTC on September10, after the strong thunderstorms diminished from Maria's center. The storm's effects on the island of Puerto Rico were primarily in the form of heavy rainfall. Flood waters near Patillas, Puerto Rico, destroyed several homes and bridges, causing $1.3 million (2011 USD) in damage. In the surrounding city of Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, heavy rainfall flooded and damaged around 150 homes. Many people were forced to relocate after rainfall and mud filled their homes. Near the city of Naguabo, Puerto Rico, the car of a 60-year-old woman was swept away by flood waters on a road. After becoming tangled in bushes, the woman was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of her car and pulled to safety. Nearly a month after the storm, U.S. president Barack Obama announced that federal disaster aid would be available to the island due to Maria.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. Before qualifying began on Saturday afternoon, Mercedes was forced to change the power unit in Nico Rosberg's car back to the one used in Belgium, which had already run for six full races, after finding an issue with the new specification unit. Meanwhile, Lotus was forced to borrow tyre blankets from other teams, as their own had been rendered unusable by rain during the night. When the session began, Nico Hülkenberg {{was one of the first}} out on track, but his fast lap was disrupted by Marcus Ericsson, who was later penalised for the incident. Both Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen spent most of the session in the pit lane. While Ricciardo was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> and set a lap sufficient to see him proceed to the second part of qualifying (Q2), Verstappen went out only to see his engine cover blown off at Curva Grande, scattering the track with debris, though at the very end of the session, so no other cars were affected. Next to Verstappen, both Manor Marussia and McLaren drivers were eliminated.|$|E

25|$|The 1995–96 season saw {{the first}} ever Heineken Cup, a new tournament set up for European clubs.

25|$|Nogueira faced Frank Mir in {{a rematch}} on December 10, 2011, at UFC 140. After close early exchanges {{and a lot}} of work against the cage, the two separated, and Nogueira rocked Mir with a hard {{overhand}} right, jab combo. After Mir fell to the ground, Nogueira continued with ground and pound before attempting a guillotine choke. Mir was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of this and during a scramble, ended in side control and locked up a kimura. Nogueira managed to roll Mir, only to be reversed himself. Mir stepped his right leg over the face of Nogueira and cranked the kimura, causing Nogueira's right humerus to break, thus ending the fight at 3:38 of round 1.|$|E
25|$|Even {{with the}} {{conditions}} treacherous, 200,000 spectators turned {{up for the}} race on Sunday afternoon. The race {{turned out to be}} a one-man show by Scotsman Jackie Stewart. While Graham Hill took the lead at the start, by the end of the first lap Stewart had moved into first place and built a nine-second lead. He put his superior Dunlop wet tires to great effect and by the end of lap 2, had extended his lead to 34 seconds. When the race ended after 14 laps, Stewart crossed the line more than 4 minutes in front of second placed Hill. The eventual World Champion had spun on lap 11, but was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the car, push it into the right direction and keep going before third-placed Jochen Rindt could catch up. Chris Amon had battled with Hill for 11 laps over second place, rarely having more than a second between the two, until Amon spun out of the race on the same lap as Hill did.|$|E
25|$|Being {{a lonely}} Serbian Anglophile Mijatović {{wished to be}} {{appointed}} as the first Serbian Minister in London, but {{had to wait until}} October 1884 when he became the second Serbian Minister at the Court of St James's. During this tenure he came into contact with many influential persons but his diplomatic post in London soon ended since he was appointed to be the sole Serbian negotiator in Bucharest where peace negotiations were scheduled following the Serbo-Bulgarian War. Serbia attacked Bulgaria on November 14, 1885 and within two weeks suffered a humiliating defeat. It was thanks to the Secret Convention signed with Austria-Hungary that Serbia was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the war without suffering more serious consequences. In Bucharest Miyatović and the Bulgarian representative Ivan Evstratiev Geshov concluded, on March 3, 1886, one of the shortest treaties in diplomatic history with one article only: „Article seul et unique. – L’état de paix qui a cessé d’exister entre le Royaume de Serbie et le Principauté du Bulgarie le 2–14 Novembre, 1885, est rétabli à partir de l’échange de ratification du present traité qui aura lieu à Bucharest.” Mijatović proved to be a peacemaker since he had ignored instructions from Belgrade that were prepared {{in such a way that}} he was supposed to find an excuse for new war. Apparently Mijatović was more worried about what sort of reputation he would have in England if negotiations failed than about criticism from Belgrade for his conciliatory approach.|$|E

25|$|The Blue Jays, {{still looking}} to clinch the division, {{travelled}} to Baltimore for a 4-game series. Behind 3–1 {{in the first}} game, Toronto rallied and tied {{the game in the}} eighth inning, before taking the lead in the ninth and holding on to win 4–3. The win lowered the team's magic number to 2. The second game of the series was rained out, and rescheduled for a doubleheader the following day. While the Blue Jays were idle due to the rain out, the Yankees lost to the Red Sox, and the magic number was lowered to 1. The Blue Jays would clinch the division by winning {{the first game of the}} doubleheader, 15–2. The starters were rested in the second game of the doubleheader, as well as in the final game of the series. Toronto lost both games, 8–1 and 6–4. Still in contention for the best record and home field advantage throughout the playoffs, the Blue Jays played their final three regular season games in Tampa Bay against the Rays. Troy Tulowitzki returned to the lineup in the first game of the series, recording 2 hits as Toronto defeated Tampa 8–4. Roberto Osuna would take the blown save and loss in the second game, as the Rays rallied in the ninth inning to win 4–3. Mark Buehrle was given the start in the final game of the season, despite having started just two days prior, and entered the game just 2 innings short of reaching 200 for the 15th consecutive season. Unfortunately, Buehrle was not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of the first inning, ending his streak as the Jays lost the game 12–3. The loss ensured that Kansas City would finish with the best record in the American League, and that the Blue Jays would play the Texas Rangers in the American League Division Series.|$|E

500|$|Blackburn {{established}} his force into a brigade formation, utilising the pioneers and machine gunners as infantry battalions, and forming a third infantry battalion from troops that {{were assigned to}} garrison the base, as well as logistics and administrative personnel, {{and members of the}} AIF who had been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of Singapore before it fell. Due to the presence of a large amount of equipment on the wharf, which had been intended to be sent to Singapore before its fall, Blackforce was able to re-equip itself handsomely with vehicles including carriers and armoured cars, Bren guns, Thompson sub-machine guns and mortars; but there were no machine guns. Concentrating around the civilian airport at Kemajoian, the battalion formed part of Blackforce's defensive garrison, tasked with protecting Batavia's five airfields from Japanese paratroopers; 'B' Company was detached in this time to defend the Buitenzorg military airfield. Shortly afterwards, they came under air attack from Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zeroes on 22 February, during which one member of the 2/3rd was killed, while six others were wounded. Two of these wounded were later smuggled out of the Indies by medical personnel back to Australia, with one rejoining the battalion there later in the year. As the Japanese began advancing further in the Indies, Blackburn sought to re-orient his troops, and the machine gunners were subsequently moved to the Leuwiliang area, [...] west of Buitenzorg along an expected main avenue of advance, and they were given the task for defence the bridge over the Tjianten River.|$|E
