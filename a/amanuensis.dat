5|$|Louis Victor Wijnhamer {{was born}} on 11 February 1904 in Tegal, Central Java, in the Dutch East Indies. One of three siblings, Wijnhamer was born to an ethnic Dutch {{administrator}} from Surabaya, Louis Gregorius Wijnhamer and J. F. Ihnen; he was of Indo descent. He studied at the senior high school in Semarang, before spending some time at the Suikerschool in Surabaya, later arriving in Batavia (now Jakarta). There, between 1927 and 1937, he worked as an <b>amanuensis</b> at the School tot Opleiding van Inlandsche Artsen.|$|E
5|$|Delius's first successes came in Germany, where Hans Haym {{and other}} {{conductors}} promoted his {{music from the}} late 1890s. In Delius's native Britain, it was 1907 before his music made regular appearances in concert programmes, after Thomas Beecham took it up. Beecham conducted the full premiere of A Mass of Life in London in 1909 (he had premiered Part II in Germany in 1908); he staged the opera A Village Romeo and Juliet at Covent Garden in 1910; and he mounted a six-day Delius festival in London in 1929, as well as making gramophone recordings of many of Delius's works. After 1918 Delius began to suffer the effects of syphilis, contracted during his earlier years in Paris. He became paralysed and blind, but completed some late compositions between 1928 and 1932 {{with the aid of}} an <b>amanuensis,</b> Eric Fenby.|$|E
50|$|He revised, {{with help}} of <b>amanuenses,</b> the {{translation}} of Swedenborg's Heaven and Hell, giving it the title The Future Life (1851).|$|R

25|$|De Doctrina Christiana (Christian Doctrine) is a Latin {{manuscript}} {{found in}} 1823 and attributed to John Milton, who died 148 years prior. Since Milton was blind {{by the time}} of the work's creation, this attribution assumes that an <b>amanuensis</b> aided the author.|$|E
25|$|During a {{long period}} of rest in dark rooms, after a {{breakdown}} of his eyesight, Harley dictated to an <b>amanuensis</b> The Urine and its Derangements (1872); this work was reprinted in America and translated into French and Italian. In 1859 he became editor of a new year-book on medicine and surgery, brought out by the New Sydenham Society, and worked for it for some years.|$|E
25|$|During {{his youth}} he was {{faithful}} {{to his father}} and was regarded as an outstanding member of the Bahá’í exile community. As a teenager he was his father’s <b>amanuensis</b> and was regularly seen debating theological issues with the learned men of the area. In 1863, Bahá'u'lláh {{and his family were}} banished from Baghdad to Istanbul. During the 1860s the family was further banished from Constantinople to Adrianople, and then finally to the penal-colony of Acre, Palestine.|$|E

60|$|On a dais stood an oaken writing-table bearing two massive wax tapers and a Crucifix. At {{this table}} sat a portly, swarthy-visaged {{man in the}} black robes {{of the order of}} St. Dominic.

25|$|He {{was born}} at Agen, the tenth child and third son of Italian scholar Julius Caesar Scaliger and Andiette de Roques Lobejac. When he was twelve years old, he was sent with two younger {{brothers}} to the College of Guienne in Bordeaux, which was then {{under the direction of}} Jean Gelida. An outbreak of the plague in 1555 caused the boys to return home, and {{for the next few years}} Joseph was his father's constant companion and <b>amanuensis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{letter was}} most {{probably}} written while Paul was in Corinth, probably {{while he was}} staying {{in the house of}} Gaius, and transcribed by Tertius his <b>amanuensis.</b> There are a number of reasons why Corinth is considered most plausible. Paul was about to travel to Jerusalem on writing the letter, which matches Acts where it is reported that Paul stayed for three months in Greece. This probably implies Corinth as it was the location of Paul’s greatest missionary success in Greece. Additionally Phoebe was a deacon of the church in Cenchreae, a port to the east of Corinth, and {{would have been able to}} convey the letter to Rome after passing through Corinth and taking a ship from Corinth’s west port. Erastus, mentioned in , also lived in Corinth, being the city's commissioner for public works and city treasurer at various times, again indicating that the letter was written in Corinth.|$|E
25|$|Her first work A View of Religion, was {{published}} in 1784, and a second and enlarged edition in 1791. The emolument she derived from this not only placed her in a comfortable situation, but enabled her to pay the debts she had contracted during her and her sister's illness, and to lend a small sum at interest. In 1799, she published A Summary History of New England, from the settlement at Plymouth {{to the adoption of}} the Federal Constitution. In gathering materials for this work, among old manuscripts, she seriously impaired her eyesight, and had to employ an <b>amanuensis</b> to prepare the copy for the printers. Her most elaborate work, The History of the Jews since the destruction of Jerusalem, was in 1818 reprinted in London, at the expense and {{for the benefit of the}} London Society for Promoting Christianity Amongst the Jews. She started an autobiography, which {{was published}} after her death by Hannah Farnham Sawyer Lee. During the later years of her life, she enjoyed a comfortable annuity, raised by her friends.|$|E

Possibly two lists of compound drugs that have ought to be added or should be dropped as dubious, in the new "Pharmacopoeia Svecica" (1775).

25|$|In May 1719, The 1st Duke of Newcastle, the Lord Chamberlain, ordered Handel to {{look for}} new singers. Handel {{travelled}} to Dresden to attend the newly built opera. He saw Teofane by Antonio Lotti, and engaged members of the cast for the Royal Academy of Music, founded {{by a group of}} aristocrats to assure themselves a constant supply of baroque opera or opera seria. Handel may have invited John Smith, his fellow student in Halle, and his son Johann Christoph Schmidt, to become his secretary and <b>amanuensis.</b> By 1723 he had moved into a Georgian house at 25 Brook Street, which he rented {{for the rest of his}} life. This house, where he rehearsed, copied music and sold tickets, is now the Handel House Museum. During twelve months between 1724 and 1725, Handel wrote three outstanding and successful operas, Giulio Cesare, Tamerlano and Rodelinda. Handel's operas are filled with da capo arias, such as Svegliatevi nel core. After composing Silete venti, he concentrated on opera and stopped writing cantatas. Scipio, from which the regimental slow march of the British Grenadier Guards is derived, was performed as a stopgap, waiting for the arrival of Faustina Bordoni.|$|E
25|$|After {{working in}} the emporium for one year, a clerkship finally opened up at the Virginia Court of Chancery. Clay adapted well to his new role, and his {{handwriting}} earned him the attention of George Wythe, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, mentor of Thomas Jefferson, and a judge on Virginia's High Court of Chancery. Hampered by a crippled hand, Wythe chose Clay as his secretary and <b>amanuensis,</b> a role in which Clay would remain for four years. The chancellor took an active interest in Clay's future, lending books and discussing philosophy with his young employee. Wythe would have a powerful effect on Clay's worldview, and Clay embraced Wythe's view that {{the example of the}} United States could help spread human freedom around the world. Clay also adopted Wythe's negative views on slavery (Wythe freed all of his slaves and hired some of them as free workers), though Clay continued to own slaves throughout his life. Wythe arranged for Clay a position with the Virginia attorney general, Robert Brooke, with the understanding that Brooke would finish Clay's legal studies. Clay was admitted to the Virginia Bar to practice law in 1797. However, the Virginia legal field was competitive, with much depending on family ties, so Clay decided to move West to be closer to his family in Kentucky.|$|E
500|$|In 1874, Longfellow oversaw a 31-volume {{anthology}} called Poems of Places which collected poems representing several geographical locations, including European, Asian, and Arabian countries. Emerson {{was disappointed}} and reportedly told Longfellow: [...] "The world is expecting better things of you than this... You are wasting time {{that should be}} bestowed upon original production". In preparing the volume, Longfellow hired Katherine Sherwood Bonner as an <b>amanuensis.</b>|$|E
60|$|We supped {{there that}} night in silence at about the hour that poor Gino Falcone would be taking his departure. Silence was {{habitual}} with us at meal-times, eating being performed--like everything else in that drab household--as a sort of devotional act. Occasionally the silence would be relieved by readings aloud from some pious work, undertaken at my mother's bidding by {{one or another of}} the <b>amanuenses.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{the year}} 1869, her sister Florence {{died at the}} age of 19. At this time a group of young sisters was growing up around her —the {{children}} of her father's second marriage.

When her suffering confined her to a darkened room, they became her readers and <b>amanuenses.</b>|$|R
25|$|Having gone totally {{blind in}} 1652, Milton wrote Paradise Lost entirely through {{dictation}} {{with the help}} of <b>amanuenses</b> and friends. He also wrote the epic poem while he was often ill, suffering from gout, {{and despite the fact that}} he was suffering emotionally after the early death of his second wife, Katherine Woodcock, in 1658, and the death of their infant daughter. Milton remarried five years later in 1663.|$|R
500|$|Scott Feinberg {{wrote in}} The Hollywood Reporter about a September 22 New York Times article that [...] "dredged up and {{highlighted}} a 1985 essay by another scholar, James Olney, that questioned the 'literal truth' of specific incidents in Northup's account {{and suggested that}} David Wilson, the white <b>amanuensis</b> to whom Northup had dictated his story, had taken the liberty of sprucing it up to make it even more effective at rallying public opinion against slavery." [...] According to Olney, when abolitionists invited an ex-slave to share his experience in slavery at an antislavery convention, and when they subsequently funded the appearance of that story in print, [...] "they had certain clear expectations, well understood by themselves and well understood by the ex-slave, too." ...|$|E
500|$|Holst first {{observed}} Joseph's potential when he {{was teaching}} [...] her composition at St Paul's Girls' School. She began to act as his <b>amanuensis</b> in 1914, {{when he was}} composing The Planets, her special responsibility being {{the preparation of the}} score for the [...] "Neptune" [...] movement. She continued to assist Holst with transcriptions, arrangements and translations, and was his librettist for the choral ballet The Golden Goose. During her short professional life she became {{an active member of the}} Society of Women Musicians, was the prime mover behind the first Kensington Musical Competition Festival, and helped to found the Kensington Choral Society. [...] She also taught music at a girls' school, where [...] Holst's daughter Imogen was one of her pupils, and became a leading figure in the musical life of Morley College.|$|E
500|$|Except for Delius, Beecham was {{generally}} antipathetic to, or at best lukewarm about, {{the music of}} his native land and its leading composers. [...] Beecham's championship of Delius, however, promoted the composer from relative obscurity. [...] Delius's <b>amanuensis,</b> Eric Fenby, referred to Beecham as [...] "excelling all others in the music of Delius ... Groves and Sargent may have matched him in the great choruses of A Mass of Life, but in all else Beecham was matchless, especially with the orchestra." [...] In an all-Delius concert in June 1911 Beecham conducted the premiere of Songs of Sunset. He put on Delius Festivals in 1929 and 1946 and presented his concert works throughout his career. He conducted the British premieres of the operas A Village Romeo and Juliet in 1910 and Koanga in 1935, and {{the world premiere of}} Irmelin in 1953. [...] However, he was not an uncritical Delian: he never conducted the Requiem, and he detailed his criticisms of it in his book on Delius.|$|E
2500|$|By 1654, Milton {{had become}} totally blind; {{the cause of}} his {{blindness}} is debated but bilateral retinal detachment or glaucoma are most likely. His blindness forced him to dictate his verse and prose to <b>amanuenses</b> who copied them out for him; one of these was poet Andrew Marvell. One of his best-known sonnets is presumed to date from this period, When I Consider How My Light is Spent, titled by a later editor [...] "On His Blindness".|$|R
5000|$|Many allusions {{have been}} made to him by English writers like John Malcolm and Mariana Postans. In Blackwood's Magazine, the mention is made of his qualities. Postans, who saw him reposing under a vine-clad bower {{surrounded}} by a number of <b>amanuenses,</b> sitting on Persian carpets, says that, ...his large black eyes lustrous as burning lamps, were illumined by the fire of intellect within, and he was an acknowledged patron of poets, men of science and literary genius.

500|$|Their final ritual {{took place}} in the Mojave Desert in late February 1946, during which Parsons {{abruptly}} decided that his undertaking was complete. On returning to the Parsonage he discovered that a woman named Marjorie Cameron—an unemployed illustrator and former Navy WAVE—had come to visit. Believing her to be the [...] "elemental" [...] woman and manifestation of Babalon that he had invoked, in early March Parsons began performing sex magic rituals with Cameron, who acted as his [...] "Scarlet Woman", while Hubbard continued to participate as the <b>amanuensis.</b> Unlike the rest of the household, Cameron knew nothing at first of Parsons' magical intentions: [...] "I didn't know anything about the O.T.O., I didn't know that they had invoked me, I didn't know anything, but the whole house knew it. Everybody was watching {{to see what was going}} on." [...] Despite this ignorance and her skepticism about Parsons' magic, Cameron reported her sighting of a UFO to Parsons, who secretly recorded the sighting as a materialization of Babalon.|$|E
500|$|Toward music {{more adventurous}} than Wagner's, {{especially}} that of Richard Strauss and later Claude Debussy, Rimsky-Korsakov's mind remained closed. He would fume for days afterwards {{when he heard}} pianist Felix Blumenfeld play Debussy's Estampes and write in his diary about them, [...] "Poor and skimpy to the nth degree; there is no technique, even less imagination." [...] This {{was part of an}} increasing musical conservatism on his part (his [...] "musical conscience," [...] as he put it), under which he now scrutinized his music and that of others as well. Compositions by his former compatriots in The Five were not immune. While working on his first revision of Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov, in 1895 he would tell his <b>amanuensis,</b> Vasily Yastrebtsev, [...] "It's incredible that I ever could have liked this music and yet it seems there was such a time." [...] By 1901 he would write of growing [...] "indignant at all [...] blunders of the ear"—this about the same music which caught his attention in 1889.|$|E
500|$|In April 1844, Verdi took on Emanuele Muzio, {{eight years}} his junior, as a pupil and <b>amanuensis.</b> He {{had known him}} since about 1828 as another of Barezzi's protégés. Muzio, who in fact was Verdi's only pupil, became {{indispensable}} to the composer. He reported to Barezzi that Verdi [...] "has a breadth of spirit, of generosity, a wisdom." [...] In November 1846, Muzio wrote of Verdi: [...] "If you could see us, I seem more like a friend, rather than his pupil. We are always together at dinner, in the cafes, when we play cards...; all in all, he doesn't go anywhere without me at his side; in the house {{we have a big}} table and we both write there together, and so I always have his advice." [...] Muzio was to remain associated with Verdi, assisting in the preparation of scores and transcriptions, and later conducting many of his works in their premiere performances in the US and elsewhere outside Italy. He was chosen by Verdi as one of the executors of his will, but predeceased the composer in 1890.|$|E
