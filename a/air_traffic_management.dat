25|$|The Aviation Systems Division conducts {{research}} and development in two primary areas: <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>management,</b> and high-fidelity flight simulation. For <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>management,</b> researchers are creating and testing concepts to allow {{for up to three}} times today's level of aircraft in the national airspace. Automation and its attendant safety consequences are key foundations of the concept development. Historically, the division has developed products that have been implemented for the flying public, such as the Traffic Management Advisor, which is being deployed nationwide. For high-fidelity flight simulation, the division operates the world's largest flight simulator (the Vertical Motion Simulator), a Level-D 747-400 simulator, and a panoramic air traffic control tower simulator. These simulators have been used for a variety of purposes including continued training for space shuttle pilots, development of future spacecraft handling qualities, helicopter control system testing, Joint Strike Fighter evaluations, and accident investigations. Personnel in the division have a variety of technical backgrounds, including guidance and control, flight mechanics, flight simulation, and computer science. Customers outside NASA have included the FAA, DOD, DHS, DOT, NTSB, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing.|$|E

[...] The DOTS, upgraded and frequently referred to as [...] "DOTS +", permits airlines to save fuel by flying random routes, in contrast to structured routes, and permits the air traffic controller to achieve lateral spacing requirements more efficiently. [...] The DOTS generates flexible oceanic tracks that are optimized for best airspace utilization and best time/fuel efficiency. [...] Flexible tracks are updated twice a day using forecasted winds aloft and separation (vertical and lateral) requirements. [...] The DOTS oceanic traffic display gives a visual presentation of tracks and weather. [...] The DOTS sends traffic advisories and track advisories to users and receives aircraft progress reports from the commercial communications service providers (CCSP).

Mathematical programming formulations of <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> flow <b>management</b> problems typically minimize delay costs. In practice, equity {{is a critical}} concern.

This presentation will describe the setup and solution of multicriteria <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> flow <b>management</b> problems. The introduced approach enables discovery of all solutions efficient / Pareto-optimal in terms of efficiency, equity, and environmental impacts without having to select and parameterize models relating fundamentally incompatible air tra c control objectives. Simulation studies show that the computational burdens associated with solving multicriteria <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> flow <b>management</b> prob- lems are larger than those associated with single-objective problems, but not necessarily large enough to prohibit their incorporation into decision support tools for air tra c controllers. In particular, it may make sense to use a two- phase approach. The first phase would involve finding supported efficient solu- tions on the boundary of the convex hull of the feasible region. The second phase finds other efficient solutions. An algorithm based on the two-phase approach would yield the same information as an algorithm solving a single-objective problem in the same time and further information / Pareto-optimal schedules as time allows...|$|R
