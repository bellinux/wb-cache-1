5|$|Bulls and Bears, <b>a</b> <b>farce</b> {{performed}} at Drury Lane on 2 December 1715, {{was attributed to}} Cibber but was never published. The Dramatic Works of Colley Cibber, Esq. (London, 1777) includes a play called Flora, or Hob in the Well, {{but it is not}} by Cibber. Hob, or the Country Wake. <b>A</b> <b>Farce.</b> By Mr. Doggett was attributed to Cibber by William Chetwood in his General History of the Stage (1749), but John Genest in Some Account of the English Stage (1832) thought it was by Thomas Doggett. Other plays attributed to Cibber but probably not by him include Cinna's Conspiracy, {{performed at}} Drury Lane on 19 February 1713, and The Temple of Dullness of 1745.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Grigorievich Zamyotov (Александр Григорьевич Заметов)– Head {{clerk at}} the police station and friend to Razumikhin. Raskolnikov arouses Zamyotov's suspicions by {{explaining}} how he, Raskolnikov, would have committed various crimes, although Zamyotov later apologizes, believing, much to Raskolnikov's amusement, that it was all <b>a</b> <b>farce</b> to expose how ridiculous the suspicions were.|$|E
5|$|It {{would be}} as great <b>a</b> <b>farce</b> of yesterday's {{election}} to designate it otherwise than a fraud. It {{was one of the}} worst ever yet perpetrated in the state. The city judges paid no attention to any registration either old or new, but permitted everybody to vote, and in many instances without question. Men were marched from one ward to another and voted early and often.|$|E

5|$|During the season, Robinson pursued {{potential}} major-league interests. The Boston Red Sox held a tryout at Fenway Park for Robinson {{and other}} black players on April 16. The tryout, however, was <b>a</b> <b>farce</b> chiefly designed to assuage the desegregationist sensibilities of powerful Boston City Councilman Isadore Muchnick. Even with the stands limited to management, Robinson {{was subjected to}} racial epithets. Robinson left the tryout humiliated, and more than fourteen years later, in July 1959, the Red Sox became the last major league team to integrate its roster.|$|E
5|$|The {{visit was}} largely {{ceremonial}} and mainly focused on mutual praise rather than specific policy planning and negotiations. Diệm {{stayed in the}} capital for four days, meeting with Eisenhower and high-ranking members of the State Department on the last of these days. However, the meeting with Dulles turned into <b>a</b> <b>farce</b> after the Secretary of State and his subordinates decided to visit Diệm at Blair House. Diệm, notorious for monologues that often lasted {{for up to six}} hours, talked endlessly and as a result the American diplomats were unable to raise whatever issues they had wanted to discuss.|$|E
5|$|Until the {{legalisation}} {{of opposition}} parties in 1992, Déby's MPS {{was the sole}} legal party in Chad. Since then, 78 registered political parties have become active. In 2005, opposition parties and human rights organisations supported the boycott of the constitutional referendum that allowed Déby to stand for re-election for a third term amid reports of widespread irregularities in voter registration and government censorship of independent media outlets during the campaign. Correspondents judged the 2006 presidential elections a mere formality, as the opposition deemed the polls <b>a</b> <b>farce</b> and boycotted them.|$|E

5|$|In December 1829, Rosas became {{governor}} of the province of Buenos Aires and established a dictatorship backed by state terrorism. In 1831, he signed the Federal Pact, recognising provincial autonomy and creating the Argentine Confederation. When his term of office ended in 1832, Rosas departed to the frontier to wage war on the indigenous peoples. After his supporters launched a coup in Buenos Aires, Rosas was asked to return and once again took office as governor. Rosas reestablished his dictatorship and formed the repressive Mazorca, an armed parapolice that killed thousands of citizens. Elections became <b>a</b> <b>farce,</b> and the legislature and judiciary became docile instruments of his will. Rosas created a cult of personality and his regime became totalitarian in nature, with all aspects of society rigidly controlled.|$|E

25|$|Muhammad Zafarullah Khan, who {{represented}} the Muslim League in July 1947 before the Radcliffe Boundary Commission, stated that the Boundary Commission was <b>a</b> <b>farce.</b> A secret deal between Mountbatten and Congress leaders had already been struck. Mehr Chand Mahajan, {{one of the two}} Non Muslim members of the Boundary Commission, in his autobiography, has acknowledged that when he was selected for the boundary commission, he was not inclined to accept the invitation as he believed that the commission was just <b>a</b> <b>farce</b> and that decisions were actually to be taken by Mountbatten himself. It was only under British pressure that the charges against Mountbatten of last minute alterations in the Radcliffe Award were not officially brought forward by Pakistani Government in the UN Security Council while presenting its case on Kashmir.|$|E
