40|$|Periodontium is a {{specialized}} tissue that keeps teeth in their position and protects roots of teeth against external noxa. In the present thesis, the 3 D structure {{blood vessels in}} human gingiva has been investigated using 3 D histochemistry and microscopical imaging. For that propose, the tissue has to be cleared, stained and imaged microscopically. We report here that the BABB method using a mixture of benzyl alcohol and benzyl benzoate and iDISCO using dibenzylether are the most successful methods for clearing connective tissue-rich gingiva for 3 D histochemistry and imaging of fluorescence using light-sheet microscopy. From a clinical point of view, objective measurements of the responses of periodontal tissue to dental treatment are key to determine {{success or failure of}} periodontal therapy. The periodontal response to novel dental treatments such as aligner therapy in orthodontics, and to the application of adjunctive tools to support the periodontal health such as photodynamic therapy, herbal tooth paste and a mouth rinses containing <b>aluminium</b> <b>triformate</b> was investigated. It is shown in this thesis that innovations in periodontology benefits from cooperation of clinician and fundamental academic researcher...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} placebo-controlled {{pilot study}} was to evaluate short-term effects of a mouthrinse containing <b>aluminium</b> <b>triformate</b> (ATF) on gingival inflammation and plaque formation in periodontal patients {{who are in the}} maintenance phase. ATF has styptic (astringent) and anti-inflammatory effects. Forty non-smoking periodontal patients with modified sulcus bleeding index (MSBI) â‰¥ 40 % were randomly divided into two groups. The participants received a masked mouthrinse (ATF or placebo) and were instructed with the rinsing protocol of 3 daily rinses during 30 s for 7 days. One blinded investigator (CE) performed all clinical examinations. The primary outcome was reduction in gingival inflammation as measured by MSBI. The secondary outcomes were reduction of the amount of plaque as measured by plaque index (PI) and approximal plaque index (API) and the occurrence of side effects. The patients were evaluated at the start {{and the end of the}} rinsing period, including the compliance of the patients. MSBI was reduced in both groups compared to baseline, but the ATF group showed significantly more reduction in MSBI compared to the placebo group (ATF: 17. 6 %, placebo: 7. 6 %, p[*]=[*] 0. 035). ATF and placebo had no effects on dental plaque. Patients reported ATF mouthrinse not to have side effects other than oral sensation, whereas compliance of the patients was good. Almost all patients in the ATF group reported reduction of gum bleeding after 1 week of rinsing with ATF. This short-term pilot clinical trial is a firm basis to design a long-term controlled clinical trial to show whether ATF helps to inhibit further periodontal breakdown in maintenance patients with high MSBI. This trial was registered in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform as DRKS 00007672, date of registration: 21 / 01 / 201...|$|E
