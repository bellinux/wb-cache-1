25|$|It {{usually takes}} me {{an hour after}} I awaken {{to get all the}} pain out. It used to be easier when I was younger. I have more muscle and joint {{difficulties}} now... Recently the only way I could get control over the pain was by sitting in bed, pulling a chair close, and pressing my larynx <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the chair. That was very uncomfortable: But it was discomfort I was deliberately creating.|$|E
500|$|General Thielmann {{then led}} eight Saxon and two Polish cavalry squadrons <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the redoubt, while {{officers}} and sergeants of his command actually forced their horses through the redoubt's embrasures, sowing confusion {{and allowing the}} French cavalry and infantry to take the position. The battle had all but ended, with both sides so exhausted that only the artillery was still at work. At 15:30, the Raevsky redoubt fell {{with most of the}} 24th Division's troops. All the Russian cannoneers in Raevsky also died right next to their cannons, and General Likhachev was captured by the French. [...] But, besides the dead Russian troops were the corpses of 1000 Caulaincourt's cuirassiers, including Caulaincourt himself.|$|E
500|$|Like many mid-15th century polyptychs, the {{exterior}} panels borrow heavily from the Ghent Altarpiece, [...] which {{was completed in}} 1432. The combination of naturalistic donor portraits with grisaille imitation statues of saints is borrowed from that work, as is {{the treatment of the}} Annunciation. Van der Weyden used iconography in the Beaune exterior panels not found in his other works, which suggests Rolin may have commissioned the altarpiece to follow van Eyck's example. Van der Weyden was not inclined merely to imitate though, and arranged the panels and figures in a concentrated and compact format. Jacobs writes that [...] "{{the exterior}} presents the most consistent pictorial rendering of trompe l'oeil sculpture to date". Gabriel's scroll and Mary's lily appear to be made of stone; the figures cast shadows <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> their niches, creating a sense of depth which adds to the illusion.|$|E

500|$|The {{pathologist}} {{arrived at}} the scene at 11:45. His report {{of the crime scene}} described [...] "the deceased lying on her back, with her leg bent at the thigh and knee, with the knee resting <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the seat, and the left thigh running {{along the edge of the}} seat with the leg hanging over the edge. The body was naked from the waist down and her left breast was exposed. Part of a pair of tights was pulled down to the left ankle. The remainder of her underwear and the other part of her tights was found in the passenger well." [...] The time of death was placed at between 01:00 and 02:00 (1:00 and 2:00a.m.) 5December. In a statement issued at the time, Detective Superintendent John Porter said: [...] "It is 99% certain that the girl was murdered, attacked, chatted to or met by her killer in a matter of seconds after Jenni Savage left her. He could have been waiting, and seen Jenni leave. It is possible that he was actually sitting in Teresa's car, as we found the nearside [...] door unlocked." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lambrick {{believed}} that raising the capstone on the Whispering Knights {{would have been}} the hardest task in the entirety of the Rollrights' construction, remarking that it was [...] "analogous" [...] to the raising of the lintels on Stonehenge. He suggested the possibility that the builders had constructed a ramp out of [...] "collected stones", which was then [...] "placed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the chamber", with the capstone then being [...] "hauled up on rollers, probably running on logs embedded longitudinally in the ramp" [...] in order to get it into position.|$|E
2500|$|There are 15 consonants in the Kinaray-a language. They are Bb, Kk, Dd, Gg, Hh, Ll, Mm, Nn, NG ng, Pp, Rr, Ss, Tt, Ww, and Yy. They are {{pronounced}} {{the same way}} as in English but a little bit lighter than their English equivalents. An exception is the letter [...] "r" [...] which is prevalent in Kinaray-a. It is sounded by flicking the tip of the tongue <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the upper front teeth and rolled a bit. Likewise the letters g, w, and y are also pronounced a bit harder as a terminal letter of a word with a grave accent mark. Except for [...] foreign loan words, the consonants c, f, j, q, x, and z don’t appear in Kinaray-a words. If foreign words are without Kinaray-a equivalent, they are either written as is, or written as pronounced using the Kinaray-a alphabet.|$|E

2500|$|The paramedic's {{body was}} found {{strapped}} in to his seat with a severe, possibly fatal, head injury from an impact <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the pilot's {{seat in front of}} him. Despite the death of both occupants of the aircraft, the UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, or AAIB, considered the impact survivable by the pilot. Had the paramedic been wearing a shoulder harness, the AAIB concluded it was likely that the paramedic would have survived the impact with the water with little or no injury, though it is possible he might then have succumbed to the cold water. The pilot, whose uninjured {{body was found}} nine months after the accident, and who had been wearing a shoulder harness, most likely survived the accident and escaped the aircraft, only to die of hypothermia in the cold water. As a result of this accident, regulations were enacted in 2015 by the European Union (EU) that require all aircraft of similar size that are used to transport passengers to be equipped with a shoulder harness, or [...] "upper torso restraint system" [...] (UTR system), for each passenger seat.|$|E
