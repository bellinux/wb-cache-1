Iran has traditionally been regarded as a non-resource constrained nation. However, {{in the latter half of}} the 1970 s Iran's trade surpluses dwindled, its foreign exchange reserves shrank, and government expenditures outran revenues. All of which indicated that Iran was becoming resource constrained. As such, the nation's tremendous defense budget proved to be an economic burden. Spiralling inflation, failing development plans and rising unemployment were the result. The people's rising expectations, brought on by the oil boom of 1973, were quickly replaced by a perception of relative deprivation. This prompted a linkage of various disenchanted groups within Iranian society who together formed the basis for Iran's civil strife in 1977 - 78, and the eventual downfall of the Shah.

40|$|AbstractWe based our {{research}} on the hypothesis that adequate corporate governance practices established within Romanian investment firms are designed to ensure the financial soundness, bringing added value and credibility {{from the perspective of}} investors. Moreover, investor protection is significantly increased if the selection decision regarding a certain investment firm is based on a rigorous analysis of the bankruptcy risk. On other hand, the capital market supervision authority (Financial Supervison Authority) would show great interest in results obtained from bankruptcy risk assessment models, for the purpose of ensuring market integrity. This paper aims to test and analyze the results determined under two classical models used for assessing the risk of bankruptcy (Altman and Conan-Holder). We investigated a sample of more than 20 Romanian investment firms, summing a total market share of around 40 % at the end of 2014. Main results show a pesimistic view in terms of the capacity to sustain financial soundness imposed in terms of prudential supervision under MiFID requirements. We believe these results may suggest major changes in the Romanian capital market in terms of mergers and <b>aquisitions</b> involving investment firms over the next 3 - 5 years...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of the dynamic forces and moments introduced into the rotating wheel when driving through bends, over pathols or when suddenly braking is of great importance for the design and validation process of a new car. Due to increasing requirements on the components, due to shorter deeloping periods {{and because of the}} product reliability requirements a cost-effective, quick and accurate measurement of the forces under operating conditions is necessary for the automotive industry as well as for its suppliers, who are increasingly responsible for the development of their products. Instead of the instrumentation of suspension components as load trnsducers, today measuring wheels or hubs are used which, however, are quite heavy, not very accurate and need elaborate calibrations and computations. With the newly developed VEhicle LOad Sensor (VELOS) these deficiencies are overcome. Examples of road load data <b>aquisitions</b> comparing the results from VELOS with those of axle transducers under different maneuvers are presented. The effect of the location of the sensor in the suspension system is demonstrated for driving over an obstacle and on rough roads.

40|$|China’s {{investments}} in the European Union are much lower than what you may expect given the economic size of both entities. These relatively low {{investments in}} Europe are a combination of priority and obstacles. The priority for investments is clearly in Asia, Africa and Latin America. This regional pattern is heavily influenced {{by the need to}} solve the resource shortage in the medium and long term. The investments in Europe and the United States are mostly market seeking investments. Research specifically focused on Chinese M&A abroad comes to the same conclusion. The success rate of Chinese M&A abroad is much lower than what we see with respect to American or European investments abroad. In this paper, we examine why Chinese firms are facing more difficulties in the European Union than in other regions. The paper focuses on Chinese M&A as proxy for total foreign direct investments abroad. By looking at the factors that have been documented as influencing the level of M&A abroad, it becomes clear that Chinese firms in Europe are hindered by many factors. For example, the trade between China and the EU is relatively low, the institutional quality is lower compared to the United States, there is less experience with respect to Europe and relatively many deals relate to State Owned Enterprises (SOE) which makes the deal sensitive. So it is logical that Chinese investments are not very high in Europe. However, the research makes clear that the obstacles for Chinese investments in Europe are disappearing step by step. In that sense, we expect a strong increase of Chinese investments in Europe in the future. FDI, mergers & <b>aquisitions,</b> China, EU...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} and analyze existing law concerning joint owner-ship in agriculture and forestry businesses. Joint ownership often arises through a succes-sion of ownership, therefore we will go through the most useful methods. Even if the owners of agriculture and forestry businesses are getting older, the numbers of succession of ownerships are still low. A succession of ownership is important to plan and its time is demanding. Often it takes {{three to five years}} for the completion of a succession of ownership. Therefore, owners must start their planning in time and think about what is to come of their business. During the planning, a decision must be made concerning who they want to take over and how it should be performed. When it comes to succession of ownership in agriculture and forestry businesses, three different methods are used. Those methods are inheritance, gift and purchase. These methods are also divided into unplanned and planned succession of ownership. For example, inheritance is unplanned and a gift and purchase, together with testamentary <b>aquisitions,</b> are planned. Inheritance occurs when the older generation passes away and the survivor inherits the property. If there is no survivor, the legal inheritance order decides who will inherit the property. Gift and purchase means that the owner gives away or sells the property to the younger generation. A combination of the methods can also be carried out. In that case, it is the compensation that decides {{if it is to be}} considered as a gift or a purchase. When the compensation exceeds the assessed value, the transfer is considered a purchase. Formerly, it was common that the oldest son took over the business. In this day and age, that does not happen as frequently. Far too often it is hard to find one person that wants to take over. Instead a succession of ownership is carried out to all the siblings. The reason for this is that the owner wants the business to stay within the family. This, even though joint ownership is to be considered as a bad solution that often leads to conflicts. Surrounding joint ownership, there are some problems that can arise at its origin during the joint ownership and in connection with the disposal. The choice of method, to transfer the farm, is of significance if a license is needed in order for the acquisition to be valid. It is also important to think through which stipulations that are put into the contract in connec-tion with the transfer. In the case that those stipulations are contrary to law then they are not valid. The problems that can arise during joint ownership often leads to disagreements. Examples of problems that will be mentioned in this thesis are which rules of law are applicable if a part owner has the right to farm the land and if the joint ownership is to be considered as a company. In the case of torn out conflicts, a possibility is presented implying that a de-mand can be made by any part owner that a sale shall be carried out at a public auction...|$|R
