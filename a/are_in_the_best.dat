25|$|Among all {{counseling}} specialty areas, public elementary, {{middle and}} high school counselors are (2009) paid the highest salary on average of all counselors. Budget cuts, however, have affected placement of public school counselors in Canada, Ireland, the United States, and other countries due to the global recession in recent years. In the United States, rural areas and urban areas traditionally have been under-served by school counselors in public schools due to both funding shortages and often a lack of best practice models. With the advent of No Child Left Behind legislation in the USA and a mandate for school counselors to be working with data and showing evidence-based practice, school counselors able to show and share results in assisting to close gaps <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> position to argue for increased school counseling resources and positions for their programs (Hatch & Bowers, 2003, 2005; ASCA, 2012).|$|E

His opponent, Bryce J. Saunders charged that the city had long lacked efficiency in its utilities, particular the water supply, which he believed in the public ownership of. Armstrong would later go on to defeat Saunders in the general election, 1791 votes to Saunders' 1072, a margin of just over 700, with a voter turnout of around 30 percent.|$|E

500|$|Passport to Pimlico {{contains}} numerous {{references to}} the Second World War to accentuate the spirit within the small Burgundian enclave. The film studies scholar Charles Barr, in his examination of the Ealing films, observes that in opposing the British government, the Burgundians [...] "recover the spirit, the resilience and local autonomy and unity of wartime London". Barr suggests the actions [...] "re-enact,... in miniature, the war experience of Britain itself". The film historian Mark Duguid, writing for the British Film Institute, considers that the opposition is a [...] "yearning nostalgia for the social unity of the war years". The film historians Anthony Aldgate and Jeffrey Richards describe Passport to Pimlico as a progressive comedy because it upsets the established social order to promote the well-being of a community. The view of the community put forward in the film has been criticised as being anachronistic, as the wartime unity had already passed by 1949. According to Aldgate and Richards, the welcome return to the ration books {{at the end of}} the film signifies an acceptance that the measures of the British government <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> interests of the people.|$|E

As the first responders, states <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> position to aid affected individuals and communities and to direct resources and assistance to where they are needed most. This includes help from the federal government and FEMA." [...] The Romney campaign released a statement following the storm stating, [...] "I believe that FEMA {{plays a key role in}} working with states and localities to prepare for and respond to natural disasters. As president, I will ensure FEMA has the funding it needs to fulfill its mission, while directing maximum resources to the first responders who work tirelessly to help those in need, because states and localities <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> position to get aid to the individuals and communities affected by natural disasters." ...|$|E

[...] As RIAs, the agents could now use the term [...] "Financial Advisors" [...] as compared to [...] "Registered Agents", with the former being held to a higher ethical standard.

There are at present three strong commandos of burghers fighting upon the British side, commanded by three Boer Generals--Marais, Celliers, and the younger Cronje, {{all of whom had}} made their names in fighting against us. This fact alone goes far to dispel those stories of British barbarity with which I shall presently deal. They are believed in by political fanatics in England and by dupes abroad, but the answer which many of the Boers upon the spot make to them is to enlist and fight under the British flag.

6000|$|Sir Dugald Dalgetty, who {{was present}} {{during the latter}} part of this scene, was very little edified by the conduct of MacEagh upon the occasion. [...] "I cannot think, my friend Ranald," [...] said he, [...] "that you <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> {{possible}} road for a dying man. Storms, onslaughts, massacres, the burning of suburbs, are indeed a soldier's daily work, and are justified by the necessity of the case, seeing that they are done in the course of duty; for burning of suburbs, in particular, it may be said that they are traitors and cut-throats to all fortified towns. Hence it is plain, that a soldier is a profession peculiarly favoured by Heaven, seeing that we may hope for salvation, although we daily commit actions of so great violence. But then, Ranald, in all services of Europe, it is the custom of the dying soldier not to vaunt him of such doings, or to recommend them to his fellows; but, on the contrary, to express contrition for the same, and to repeat, or have repeated to him, some comfortable prayer; which, if you please, I will intercede with his Excellency's chaplain to prefer on your account. It is otherwise no point of my duty to put you in mind of those things; only it may be for the ease of your conscience to depart more like a Christian, and less like a Turk, than you seem to be in a fair way of doing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 53. Style: Francis Edgeworth's 'Dramatic Fragment:' Criticisms. I {{should say}} [to your young friend] style is in Poetry of incalculable importance. He seems, however, aware of it, for his diction is {{obviously}} studied. Now the great difficulty {{is to determine}} what constitutes a good style. In estimating this we are all subject to delusion, not improbably I am so, when {{it appears to me}} that the metaphor in the first speech of his dramatic scene is too much drawn out. It does not pass off as rapidly as metaphors ought to do, I think, in dramatic writing. I am well aware that our early dramatists abound with these continuities of imagery, but to me they appear laboured and unnatural, at least unsuited to that species of composition, of which action and motion are the essentials. 'While with the ashes of a light that was,' and the two following lines, <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> style of dramatic writing. To every opinion thus given always add, I pray you, 'in my judgment,' though I may not, to save trouble or to avoid a charge of false modesty, express it. 'This over-pressure of a heavy pleasure,' &c., is admirable; and, indeed, it would be tedious to praise all that pleases me. Shelley's 'Witch of Atlas' I never saw; therefore the stanza referring to Narcissus and her was read by me to some disadvantage. One observation I am about to make will at least prove I am no flatterer, and will therefore give a qualified value to my praise.|$|E

But experience has brought [...] with it its lessons. I have learnt {{that there is a}} wisdom in a [...] policy of trust, and folly in a policy of mistrust.
