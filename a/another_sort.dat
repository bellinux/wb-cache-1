500|$|A common {{comment on}} the novel is the graphic nature of the many acts of torture and murder which are {{depicted}} in the novel. Vargas lets the reader see the realities of an oppressive regime {{with a degree of}} detail not often used by his compatriots in Latin American literature, as Michael Wood suggests in the London Review of Books: [...] "Vargas Llosa ... tells us far more about the details of day-to-day intrigue, and the sordid, sadistic minutiae of torture and murder." [...] Walter Kirn of the New York Times suggests that the [...] "grisly scenes of dungeon interrogations and torture sessions" [...] cast other aspects of the novel in a pale light, draining them of their significance and impact. Similarly, Kirn implies that the [...] "narrative machinery" [...] mentioned by Wood as being somewhat unwieldy also produces a largely superfluous storyline. The plot line centered on Urania Cabral is described by Sturrock as being an emotional centre that focuses the novel, and Wood agrees that her confrontations with past demons hold the readers attention. In contrast, Kirn's review states that Urania's segments are [...] "talky and atmospheric ... seem to be on loan from <b>another</b> <b>sort</b> of book." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{computer}} science, counting sort is an algorithm for sorting {{a collection}} of objects according to keys that are small integers; that is, it is an integer sorting algorithm. It operates by {{counting the number of}} objects that have each distinct key value, and using arithmetic on those counts to determine the positions of each key value in the output sequence. Its running time is linear in the number of items and the difference between the maximum and minimum key values, so it is only suitable for direct use in situations where the variation in keys is not significantly greater than the number of items. However, it is often used as a subroutine in <b>another</b> <b>sorting</b> algorithm, radix sort, that can handle larger keys more efficiently.|$|R
