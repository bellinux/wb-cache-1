"I {{was going}} to explain to you, you remember, how government, by an {{aristocracy}} in England, operates in respect to {{the division of the}} fruits of labor among those who produce them. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> it operates in such a manner as to give an immensely large proportion of the value to the aristocratic classes themselves, and an exceedingly small portion to the people who actually do the work.|$|E
6000|$|I said, [...] "Gentlemen, I wish to {{introduce}} my friend, Mr. Homos," [...] and then I presented them severally {{to him by}} name. We all sat down, and I explained: [...] "Mr. Homos is from Altruria. He is visiting our country for the first time, and is greatly interested in the working of our institutions.

"Hush! {{here comes}} Mrs. Portman," [...] some one said, {{as the good}} Rector's wife entered Madame Fribsby's shop, to inspect her monthly book of fashions just arrived from London. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Madame Fribsby {{had been able to}} hold out no longer; and one day, after she and her lodger had been talking of Pen's {{approaching}} departure, and the Curate had gone off to give one of his last lessons to that gentleman, Madame Fribsby had communicated to Mrs. Pybus, who happened to step in with Mrs. Speers, her strong suspicion, her certainty almost, that there was an attachment between a certain clerical gentleman and a certain lady, whose naughty son was growing quite unmanageable, and that a certain marriage would take place pretty soon.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{whether a}} {{peculiar}} contraction of the Jew's red eye-brows, {{and a half}} closing of his deeply-set eyes, warned Miss Nancy that she was disposed to be too communicative, {{is not a matter}} of much importance. The fact is all we need care for here; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> she suddenly checked herself, and with several gracious smiles upon Mr. Sikes, turned the conversation to other matters. In about ten minutes' time, Mr. Fagin was seized with a fit of coughing; upon which Nancy pulled her shawl over her shoulders, and declared it was time to go. Mr. Sikes, finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself, expressed his intention of accompanying her; they went away together, followed, at a little distant, by the dog, who slunk out of a back-yard as soon as his master was out of sight.|$|E

"When I {{was with}} him, I {{insisted that he}} should do {{something}} for their instruction; and, to please me, he did get a chaplain, and used to have them catechized Sunday, though, I believe, in his heart, that {{he thought it would}} do about as much good to set a chaplain over his dogs and horses. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> a mind stupefied and animalized by every bad influence from the hour of birth, spending the whole of every week-day in unreflecting toil, cannot be done much with by a few hours on Sunday. The teachers of Sunday-schools among the manufacturing population of England, and among plantation-hands in our country, could perhaps testify to the same result, there and here. Yet some striking exceptions there are among us, {{from the fact that the}} negro is naturally more impressible to religious sentiment than the white." ...|$|E

6000|$|... § 8. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> {{the great}} and {{pre-eminent}} fault of southern, as compared with northern scenery, is this rock-whiteness, which gives to distant mountain ranges, lighted by the sun, sometimes a faint and monotonous glow, hardly detaching itself from the whiter parts of the sky, and sometimes a speckled confusion of white light with blue shadow, breaking up the whole mass of the hills, and making them look near and small; the whiteness being still distinct at the distance of twenty or twenty-five miles. The inferiority and meagreness of such effects of hill, compared with the massive purple and blue of our own heaps of crags and morass, or the solemn grass-green and pine-purples of the Alps, have always struck me most painfully; and they have rendered it impossible for any poet or painter studying in the south, to enter with joy into hill scenery. Imagine the difference to Walter Scott, if instead of the single lovely color which, named by itself alone, was enough to describe his hills,-- ...|$|E

Whether we examine the contour of the simpler convex bells, or those of the leaves which bend outwards from the richer and more Corinthian types, we find they are all outlined by grand and simple curves, and that the whole of their minute fretwork and thistle-work is cast into a gigantic mould which subdues all their multitudinous points and foldings to its own inevitable dominion. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> in the sweeping lines and broad surfaces of these Byzantine sculptures we obtain, so far as I know, {{for the first time}} in the history of art, the germ of that unity of perfect ease in every separate part, with perfect subjection to an enclosing form or directing impulse, which was brought to its most intense expression in the compositions of the two men in whom the art of Italy consummated itself and expired--Tintoret and Michael Angelo.|$|E
6000|$|... § XXI. It must {{be evident}} {{to the reader}} at a glance, that the real serviceableness {{of any of these}} grouped {{arrangements}} must depend upon the relative shortness of the shafts, and that, when the whole pier is so lofty that its minor members become mere reeds or rods of stone, those minor members can no longer be charged with any considerable weight. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> in the most complicated Gothic arrangements, when the pier is tall and its satellites stand clear of it, no real work is given them to do, and they might all be removed without endangering the building. They are merely the expression of a great consistent system, and are in architecture what is often found in animal anatomy,--a bone, or process of a bone, useless, under the ordained circumstances of its life, to the particular animal in which it is found, and slightly developed, but yet distinctly existent, and representing, for the sake of absolute consistency, the same bone in its appointed, and generally useful, place, either in skeletons of all animals, or in the genus to which the animal itself belongs.|$|E

60|$|Tim {{looked at}} the {{mistress}} in great wonderment: <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> six hours previous I would as soon have thought of burning the house down as calling {{for a bottle of}} claret on my own account; but I felt I was a man now, and had a right to command; and my mother felt this too, for she turned to the fellow and said, sharply, 'Don't you hear, you rascal, what YOUR MASTER says! Go, get the wine, and the cakes and glasses, directly.' Then (for you may be sure she did not give Tim the keys of our little cellar) she went and got the liquor herself; and Tim brought it in, on the silver tray, in due form. My dear mother poured out the wine, and drank the Captain welcome; but I observed her hand shook very much as she performed this courteous duty, and the bottle went clink, clink, against the glass. When she had tasted her glass, she said she had a headache, and would go to bed; and so I asked her blessing, as becomes a dutiful son--(the modern BLOODS have given up the respectful ceremonies which distinguished a gentleman in my time)--and she left me and Captain Fagan to talk over our important business.|$|E
6000|$|... § 25. Such, then, {{being the}} {{characters}} required {{in order to}} constitute high art, if the reader will think over them a little, and over the various ways in which they may be falsely assumed, he will easily perceive how spacious and dangerous a field of discussion they open to the ambitious critic, and of error to the ambitious artist; he will see how difficult it must be, either to distinguish what is truly great art from the mockeries of it, or to rank the real artists in any thing like a progressive system of greater and less. For it will have been observed that the various qualities which form greatness are partly inconsistent with each other (as some virtues are, docility and firmness for instance), and partly independent of each other; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> artists differ not more by mere capacity, than by the component elements of their capacity, each possessing in very different proportions the several attributes of greatness; so that, classed by one kind of merit, as, for instance, purity of expression, Angelico will stand highest; classed by another, sincerity of manner, Veronese will stand highest; classed by another, love of beauty, Leonardo will stand highest; and so on; hence arise continual disputes and misunderstandings among those who think that high art must always be one and the same, and that great artists ought to unite all great attributes in an equal degree.|$|E
6000|$|Accusations of ingratitude, {{and just}} accusations no doubt, are made against every {{inhabitant}} of this wicked world, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> {{a man who}} is ceaselessly engaged in its trouble and turmoil, borne hither and thither upon the fierce waves of the crowd, bustling, shifting, struggling to keep himself somewhat above water--fighting for reputation, or more likely for bread, and ceaselessly occupied to-day with plans for appeasing the eternal appetite of inevitable hunger to-morrow--a man in such straits has hardly time to think of anything but himself, and, as in a sinking ship, must make his own rush for the boats, and fight, struggle, and trample for safety. In the midst of such a combat as this, the [...] "ingenious arts, which prevent the ferocity of the manners, and act upon them as an emollient" [...] (as the philosophic bard remarks in the Latin Grammar) are likely to be jostled to death, and then forgotten. The world will allow no such compromises between it and that which does not belong to it--no two gods must we serve; but (as one has seen in some old portraits) the horrible glazed eyes of Necessity are always fixed upon you; fly away as you will, black Care sits behind you, and with his ceaseless gloomy croaking drowns the voice of all more cheerful companions. Happy he whose fortune has placed him where there is calm and plenty, and who has the wisdom not to give up his quiet in quest of visionary gain.|$|E
6000|$|Laura {{gazed at}} him in bewilderment, but the man's {{expression}} was perfectly grave.

6000|$|... § 6. The reader will, I hope, {{understand}} how much importance {{is to be}} attached to the sentence in the first parenthesis, [...] "if the choice be sincere;" [...] for choice of subject is, of course, only available as a criterion of the rank of the painter, when it is made from the heart. Indeed, in the lower orders of painting, the choice is always made from such heart as the painter has; for his selection of the brawls of peasants or sports of children can, of course, proceed only from {{the fact that he has}} more sympathy with such brawls or pastimes than with nobler subjects. But the choice of the higher kind of subjects is often insincere; and may, therefore, afford no real criterion of the painter's rank. The greater number of men who have lately painted religious or heroic subjects have done so in mere ambition, because they had been taught that it was a good thing to be a [...] "high art" [...] painter; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> in nine cases out of ten, the so-called historical or [...] "high-art" [...] painter is a person infinitely inferior to the painter of flowers or still life. He is, in modern times, nearly always a man who has great vanity without pictorial capacity, and differs from the landscape or fruit painter merely in misunderstanding and over-estimating his own powers. He mistakes his vanity for inspiration, his ambition for greatness of soul, and takes pleasure in what he calls [...] "the ideal," [...] merely because he has neither humility nor capacity enough to comprehend the real.|$|E
6000|$|... § XII. You think, perhaps, I {{have put}} the {{requirements}} in wrong order. Logically I have; practically I have not: for {{it is necessary first}} to teach men to speak out, and say what they like, truly; and, in the second place, to teach them which of their likings are ill set, and which justly. If a man is cold in his likings and dislikings, or if he will not tell you what he likes, you can make nothing of him. Only get him to feel quickly and to speak plainly, and you may set him right. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> the great evil of all recent architectural effort has not been that men liked wrong things: but that they either cared nothing about any, or pretended to like what they did not. Do you suppose that any modern architect likes what he builds, or enjoys it? Not in the least. He builds it because he has been told that such and such things are fine, and that he should like them. He pretends to like them, and gives them a false relish of vanity. Do you seriously imagine, reader, that any living soul in London likes triglyphs?[30]--or gets any hearty enjoyment out of pediments?[31] You are much mistaken. Greeks did: English people never did,--never will. Do you fancy that the architect of old Burlington Mews, in Regent Street, had any particular satisfaction in putting the blank triangle over the archway, instead of a useful garret window? By no manner of means. He had been told it was right to do so, and thought he should be admired for doing it. Very few faults of architecture are mistakes of honest choice: they are almost always hypocrisies.|$|E
60|$|The {{point is}} not that women are unworthy of votes; {{it is not even}} that votes are unworthy of women. It is that votes are unworthy of men, so long as they are merely votes; and have nothing in them of this ancient militarism of democracy. The only crowd worth talking to is the crowd that is ready to go somewhere and do {{something}}; the only demagogue worth hearing is he who can point at something to be done: and, if he points with a sword, will only feel it familiar and useful like an elongated finger. Now, except in some mystical exceptions which prove the rule, these are not the gestures, and therefore not the instincts, of women. No honest man dislikes the public woman. He can only dislike the political woman; an entirely different thing. The instinct {{has nothing to do with}} any desire to keep women curtained or captive: if such a desire exists. A husband would be pleased if his wife wore a gold crown and proclaimed laws from a throne of marble; or if she uttered oracles from the tripod of a priestess; or if she could walk in mystical motherhood before the procession of some great religious order. But that she should stand on a platform in the exact altitude in which he stands; leaning forward a little more than is graceful and holding her mouth open a little longer and wider than is dignified&mdash;well, I only write here of the facts of natural history; <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it is this, and not publicity or importance, that hurts. It is for the modern world to judge whether such instincts are indeed danger signals; and whether the hurting of moral as of material nerves is a tocsin and a warning of nature.|$|E
