50|$|The firm, {{brownish}} base is {{then spread}} with jam — usually raspberry or blackcurrant — and a meringue mix {{made from the}} reserved egg whites is spooned over the jam. The pudding is returned to the oven <b>and</b> <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> the meringue is golden, but still soft. The pudding is eaten hot.|$|R
50|$|Green bean chips may be {{prepared}} mixed {{with olive oil}} and seasonings, which is placed on a baking pan <b>and</b> <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> they are crisp. They may {{be prepared}} by freeze-drying green beans that are then vacuum-fried. Per a one-ounce (30 g) serving, green bean chips contain 130 calories, 4.5 g fat and 5 g fiber.|$|R
50|$|Chocolate tart, {{also known}} as {{chocolate}} cream pie, is a dessert consisting of dark chocolate, cream and eggs, beaten together, poured into a crisp, unsweetened pastry shell <b>and</b> <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> firm. It is considered a form of custard tart because it includes an egg-based filling. The dish is similar in composition to chocolate mousse, however, being baked gives the chocolate tart a firmer texture.|$|R
50|$|A butter tart {{is a type}} {{of small}} pastry tart highly {{regarded}} in Canadian cuisine and considered one of Canada's quintessential desserts. The tart consists of butter, sugar, syrup, and egg filled into a flaky pastry <b>and</b> <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> the filling is semi-solid with a crunchy top. The butter tart {{should not be confused with}} butter pie (a savoury pie from the Preston area of Lancashire, England) or with bread and butter pudding.|$|R
50|$|According to most recipes, the yolks must be whipped {{until they}} swell to double their {{original}} volume. Some recipes also call for egg whites (1--2 whites for each 10 yolks), beaten separately to stiff peaks consistency and gently mixed into the yolks. The mixture is then poured into greased muffin forms (about 1/2 tablespoon each) <b>and</b> <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> they are firm but still without crust. The pieces are then boiled lightly in the syrup, {{which may be}} flavored with rum, vanilla, or orange peel.|$|R
50|$|Albanian, Bulgarian, Bosnian, Croatian, Macedonian, Montenegrin, Romanian, Slovenian and Serbian {{versions}} use potatoes {{instead of}} eggplant, pork or beef mince, {{and the top}} layer is usually milk or yogurt mixed with raw eggs, sometimes {{with a couple of}} spoons of flour added. There is also a three-layer version: the bottom layer consists of ground pork and beef, the middle layer of potato slices, and the top layer is typically a custard. Each layer is cooked on its own and layered in a pan <b>and</b> <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> the top is browned.|$|R
5000|$|Bappir was a Sumerian twice-baked {{barley bread}} that was {{primarily}} used in ancient Mesopotamian beer brewing. Historical research done at Anchor Brewing Co. in 1989 (documented in Charlie Papazian's Home Brewer's Companion (...) [...] ) reconstructed a bread made from malted barley and barley flour with honey <b>and</b> water <b>and</b> <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> {{hard enough to}} store {{for long periods of}} time; the finished product was probably crumbled and mixed with water, malt and either dates or honey and allowed to ferment, producing a somewhat sweet brew. It seems to have been drunk with a straw in the manner that yerba mate is drunk now.|$|R
50|$|An éclair is an oblong pastry {{made with}} choux dough {{filled with a}} cream and topped with icing. The dough, {{which is the same}} as that used for profiterole, is {{typically}} piped into an oblong shape with a pastry bag <b>and</b> <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> it is crisp and hollow inside. Once cool, the pastry is then filled with a vanilla-, coffee- or chocolate-flavoured custard (crème pâtissière), or with whipped cream, or chiboust cream; and then iced with fondant icing. Other fillings include pistachio- and rum-flavoured custard, fruit-flavoured fillings, or chestnut purée. The icing is sometimes caramel, in which case the dessert may be called a bâton de Jacob.|$|R
50|$|Buttermilk pie is a custard-like pie. Originally {{from the}} United Kingdom, {{it is now}} a {{traditional}} pie of the southern United States. It is similar to, and sometimes confused with, chess pie but it does not include cornmeal. The basic filling consists of a mixture of sugar, butter, eggs, buttermilk and wheat flour. Variations on the recipe may include flavorings such as vanilla, lemon zest and nutmeg. Buttermilk pies are made with a pie crust. The filling is poured into the crust <b>and</b> <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> the mixture sets. The pie is best eaten at room temperature after being allowed to cool, but may be eaten either warm from the oven or after being chilled.|$|R

50|$|Malooga {{dough is}} made much like pizza dough with water, yeast, salt, and flour. It is kneaded {{very well and}} set to rise for an hour. It is cut to large rounds. Each round is then {{stretched}}, and warm ghee is spread over the stretched dough, it is folded over and more ghee is applied, and this process is repeated 1-3 times. All sides are pinched {{together to form a}} neat ball. After a few minutes of sitting, the round is stretched into a flat circular shape and placed on a makhbaza that is used in placing the dough on the wall of a hot taboon much like the tandoor. It is then glazed with an egg-wash, ghee, or buttermilk <b>and</b> <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> the bottom is brown and with some browning on top.|$|R
50|$|The modern Greek {{version was}} {{probably}} formulated by chef Tselementes in the 1920s. It has three layers that are separately cooked before being combined {{for the final}} baking: a bottom layer of sliced eggplant sautéed in olive oil; a middle layer of ground lamb lightly cooked with chopped or puréed tomatoes, onion, garlic, and spices (cinnamon, allspice and black pepper); and a top layer of Béchamel sauce or savoury custard. The composed dish is then layered into a pan <b>and</b> <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> the top layer is browned. Moussaka is usually served warm, not piping hot; if cut hot out of the oven, moussaka squares tend to slide apart and consequently the dish needs some resting time to firm up before serving. Reheating, however, does not present the same problem.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first modern}} recipe for the dish was {{included}} in Elizabeth Raffald's 1770 book, The Experienced English Housekeeper. Raffald's recipe is for a Béchamel sauce with cheddar cheese—a Mornay sauce in French cooking—which is mixed with macaroni, sprinkled with Parmesan, <b>and</b> <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> bubbly <b>and</b> golden. The famous British Victorian cookbook Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management included two recipes for the dish. One recipe states that [...] "The macaroni, (which should be [...] "tender but perfectly firm, no part being allowed to melt, and the form entirely preserved" [...] - lest one be tempted to cook {{it for so long}} it actually disintegrated) is then topped with more cheese, pepper and breadcrumbs, before receiving a final dose of melted butter for good measure and being placed before a [...] "bright fire" [...] to brown the crumbs, or grilled with a salamander broiler.|$|R
50|$|The {{ingredients}} for pecel pitik {{must be prepared}} beforehand. The chicken is rubbed in tamarind water, salt, <b>and</b> spices,and <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> cooked <b>and</b> browned. Then, the chicken is drained and shred. After that, the grated coconut is cooked. Added spices include fried nutmeg, salt, chili, and peanuts that have been roasted. The seasoning is mixed with chicken that has been cut in several pieces. Optionally, lime juice is added. Finally, pecel pitik is ready to serve.|$|R
5000|$|Much earlier, in his autobiography, Every Man a King, Governor and U.S. Senator Huey Pierce Long, Jr., of Louisiana, defined [...] "potlikker", a {{favorite}} of his country political supporters, asthe juice that remains in a pot after greens or other vegetables are boiled with proper seasoning. The best seasoning {{is a piece of}} salt fat pork, commonly referred to as [...] "dry salt meat" [...] or [...] "side meat". If a pot be partly filled with well-cleaned turnip greens and turnips (which should be cut up), with a half-pound piece of the salt pork and then with water and boiled until the greens and turnips are cooked reasonably tender, then the juice remaining in the pot is the delicious, invigorating, soul-and-body sustaining potlikker ... which should be taken as any other soup and the greens eaten as any other food. ...Long continued Most people crumble cornpone (corn meal mixed with a little salt and water, made into a pattie <b>and</b> <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> it is hard) into the potlikker.|$|R
5000|$|Kab el Ghazal (Arabic:قب الغزل [...] ): Kab el Ghazal {{literally}} translates from Moroccan Arabic as [...] "gazelle ankles", these crescent-shaped {{cookies are}} famously known as Gazelle Horns, or Cornes de Gazelle in French. They're frequently served at special occasions like Eid or visitations. Almond paste scented with orange flower water and cinnamon is enclosed in a delicate pastry, molded into a crescent, <b>and</b> then <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> golden. A dip in orange flower water {{followed by a}} dusting of powdered sugar is optional - in that case, the pastries {{are referred to as}} Kaab el Ghazal M'fenned.|$|R
50|$|The Hot Brown is an open-faced {{sandwich}} {{of turkey}} and bacon, covered in Mornay sauce <b>and</b> <b>baked</b> or broiled <b>until</b> the bread is crisp and the sauce begins to brown. Many Hot Browns also include ham with the turkey, and either pimentos or tomatoes over the sauce, and imitation Hot Browns sometimes substitute a commercial cheese sauce {{instead of the}} Mornay.|$|R
5000|$|Seng-phe and Halawa [...] These {{are typical}} sweets {{of the people}} of Thai Yai. ‘Seng-phe’ looks like red sticky rice conserve, cooked from sticky rice, {{sugarcane}} juice and coconut milk, <b>and</b> <b>baked</b> or grilled <b>until</b> its coconut creamy topping turns brown. ‘Halawa’ is cooked from rice flour, granulated sugar, coconut milk, and tapioca, and topped with coconut cream like Seng-phe. Both of them have a sweet and creamy taste.|$|R
50|$|We {{only know}} little about the other types of bread in the olden times. More refined bread types for special {{occasions}} and feasts were prepared from sifted rye flour, and loaves made from wheat must have been eaten. Around 1400, the emblem of the bakers’ guild became the triangular skonrogge (i.e. a small leavened rye bread that is cleaved <b>and</b> <b>baked</b> again <b>until</b> dry, also Danish beskøjt, French biscuit, Latin bis-coctus: baked twice). Around 1600, the skonrogge was replaced as the baker’s emblem by the pretzel-shaped kringle, which is still the emblem of the bakers’ guild today. We find the first systematic description of Danish bread in 1821 in Charles Adolph Dénys Mourier’s book on bread and bread-making. He describes various leavened bread types: rugbrød (whole rye bread), franskbrød (white wheat bread), sigtebrød (sifted rye bread) and tvebakker (wheat biscuits), as well as unleavened bread types: fladbrød (wheat, rye, oats, bran in various combinations) and wafers.|$|R
50|$|The names Granula and Granola were {{registered}} trademarks {{in the late}} 19th century United States for foods consisting of whole grain products crumbled <b>and</b> then <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> crisp, {{in contrast to the}} at that time (about 1900) contemporary invention, muesli, which is traditionally neither baked nor sweetened. The name is now a trademark only in Australia and New Zealand, but is still more commonly referred to as muesli there. The trademark is owned by the Australian Health & Nutrition Association Ltd.'s Sanitarium Health Food Company in Australia and Australasian Conference Association Limited in New Zealand.Granula was invented in Dansville, New York, by Dr. James Caleb Jackson at the Jackson Sanitarium in 1863. The Jackson Sanitarium was a prominent health spa that operated into the early 20th century on the hillside overlooking Dansville. It was also known as Our Home on the Hillside; thus the company formed to sell Jackson's cereal was known as the Our Home Granula Company. Granula was composed of Graham flour and was similar to an oversized form of Grape-Nuts. A similar cereal was developed by John Harvey Kellogg. It too was initially known as Granula, but the name was changed to Granola to avoid legal problems with Jackson.|$|R

5000|$|As was {{the custom}} {{in the early}} 1900s, {{newspapers}} generally referred to her as [...] "Mrs. Henry Aitken" [...] or [...] "Mrs. H.M. Aitken"; it was rare for her first name to be used. But {{she had begun to}} become well known for her homemaking and farm management skills, and women's page reporters in Toronto were praising her as a [...] "practical farm business woman." [...] In 1923, she set up a “Country Kitchen” in the Women’s Building of the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) in Toronto, where she gave talks about canning and preserving, while selling some of her own home-made jams <b>and</b> <b>baked</b> goods. <b>Until</b> 1928, she worked for the Ontario Department of Agriculture speaking to rural women about farming. [...] She subsequently taught cooking, at the Canadian National Exhibition, where she was named the director of the Women's Activities in early 1939. She continued in that role for the next thirteen years. Beginning in the 1920s, she became known for her recipes, which she first published as pamphlets or booklets. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, her cooking talks were extremely popular: some of her classes at the CNE drew several thousand people, both men and women. Rural farm women found her especially helpful, since she understood their situation and was able to offer them helpful hints about managing their household more effectively. While serving as director of women's activities for the CNE, she became known for creating unique displays for the Exhibition, such as persuading the British government to allow one of Queen Elizabeth's famous dresses to be shown. She was also known for booking guest appearances by celebrities and dignitaries: among them was former American first lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who gave a 1951 talk at the Exhibition that was also carried by the CBC. Mrs. Aitken finally resigned from her position in November 1952.|$|R

5000|$|The aroma <b>and</b> {{texture of}} <b>baked</b> goods {{as they come}} out of the oven are {{strongly}} appealing but is a quality that is quickly lost. Since the flavour and appeal largely depend on freshness, commercial producers have to compensate by using food additives as well as imaginative labeling. As more <b>and</b> more <b>baked</b> goods are purchased from commercial suppliers, producers try to capture that original appeal by adding the label [...] "home-baked." [...] Such attempts seek to make an emotional link to the remembered freshness of baked goods as well as to attach positive associations the purchaser has with the idea of [...] "home" [...] to the bought product. Freshness is such an important quality that restaurants, although they are commercial (and not domestic) preparers of food, bake their own products. For example, scones at The Ritz London Hotel [...] "are not <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> early afternoon on the day they are to be served, {{to make sure they are}} as fresh as possible." ...|$|R
