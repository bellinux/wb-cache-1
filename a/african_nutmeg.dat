40|$|An {{investigation}} into the Poisson&# 8217;s ratio and elastic modulus of <b>African</b> <b>nutmeg</b> {{as a function of}} moisture content and loading rate was carried out. Quasi-static compressive tests were conducted at moisture levels of 8, 11. 2, 14, 17. 4 and 28. 7 % (d. b.) in an axial loading orientation. Both unit lateral extension and unit normal compression values were determined. Average values of 0. 512 to 0. 275 were obtained for moisture levels of 8 to 28. 7 %, respectively. Effects of loading rates were also investigated and results show that Poisson&# 8217;s ratio increased from 0. 136 to 0. 334 at loading rates of 1 and 7 mm min- 1, respectively. Elastic modulus was observed to decrease as moisture increased. Average values of 201. 5 to 41. 30 N mm- 2 were noted for moisture levels of 8 to 28. 7 %, respectively.

40|$|Abstract: Fracture {{resistance}} of <b>African</b> <b>nutmeg</b> {{was investigated in}} the areas of average compressive force, toughness (Strain energy), deformation, failure stress and modulus of elasticity at seed coat rupture as a function of moisture content and loading position. Quasi-static compressive tests were conducted at moisture levels of 8. 0, 11. 2, 14. 0, 17. 4 and 28. 7 percent d. b in both axial and lateral loading positions. Force required to initiate seed coat rupture decreased as moisture content increased from 8. 0 to 28. 7 percent. Generally, african nutmegs loaded in the axial position consistently developed seed coat rupture at lower magnitudes of force than those loaded in the lateral positions. Toughness values increased form 0. 020. 6 N. mm to 0. 034 Nmm for 8. 0 and 28. 7 percent moistures respectively in the axial loading position. These values of toughness changed from 0. 0356 to 1. 061 Nmm for same levels of moisture, though in the lateral loading position. Modulus of elasticity and failure stress also decreased with increase in moisture content levels in the two loading orientations.

Medicinal plants are acknowledged to have antioxidant activities because they are rich in several antioxidant molecules. Hence, in order to combat cadmium induced hepatic injury; medicinal plants might be appropriate due to their relative availability, low cost and minimal side effects.

30|$|<b>African</b> <b>nutmeg</b> is a berry, which grows well in African {{evergreen}} forests {{where it}} is widely used as a condiment for different delicacies. Traditionally, {{it is used to}} cure sores from guinea worm infections, constipation, stomach-ache and headache as well as to stop intra-uterine bleeding in women after child birth. The seed oil is also useful as a carminative and for scenting perfumes and soaps (Burubai et al. 2008; Dada et al. 2013; Ekeanyanwu et al. 2010; Ojiako et al. 2010). Additionally, the root is munched to mitigate toothaches and arthritis and is also utilized in the management of anaemia, haemorrhoids as well as sexual weakness (Erukainure et al. 2012). Previous studies have reported the antioxidant properties of M. myristica seeds (Erukainure et al. 2012; Moukette et al. 2015). This minty smelling seed has also been investigated to possess cholesterol lowering activity (Nwozo et al. 2015), anti-sickling activity (Nwaoguikpe and Uwakwe 2008), antimicrobial activity (Esekhiagbe et al. 2009) as well as anthelmintic activity (Ekeanyanwu and Etienajirhevwe 2012).|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} and moisture content of <b>African</b> <b>nutmeg</b> seed coat was studied as it affects compressive force, deformation, failure stress, strain energy and {{modulus of elasticity}} (firmness). Quasi-static compressive tests were conducted at sample temperatures of 60, 100, 140, 180 and 220 Ã‚Â°C. Similar tests were also performed at moisture content levels of 8, 11. 2, 14, 17. 4 and 28. 7 % (db) in an axial loading orientation. Investigations revealed that the force needed to crack open the seed coat decreased from 52. 8 to 32 N at temperatures of 60 and 220 Ã‚Â°C, respectively. A similar trend was also observed as compressive force decreased from 56. 6 to 33 N and as moisture levels increased from 8 to 28. 7 %, respectively. Deformation values were observed to increase from 0. 64 to 0. 97 mm for 60 and 220 Ã‚Â°C, respectively.

40|$|Prices of cloves, cardamom, ginger, {{vanilla and}} black pepper have fallen by up to 75 % because of over-production. As a result, the current {{unfavourable}} prices for these well-known spices are a disappointment for all producers and a near disaster for some. Perhaps the time has now come to investigate the potential of many other species that are used as spices: to broaden the varietal base of spices in the market in order to stimulate changes in taste, flavour, aroma and, hopefully, demand. Some of these new introductions to the market can be used singly, whilst others {{may be used in}} combination with more familiar spices to bring about changes in tastes and demand. New spice resources In a recent survey carried out at the National Horticultural Institute, Ibadan, Nigeria it was found that out of 34 spices in the country 26 belong to commonly and locally produced types, while the handful of others are exotic imports. The locally-produced spices can be classified further into two broad groups based on their mode of production, namely (a) regularly cultivated species such as onions, garlic and peppers and (b) species grown in the wild such as <b>African</b> <b>nutmeg</b> (Monodora myristica) and Alligator pepper (Aframomum melegueta), a selection of which are listed (see table). The species grown in the wild include various plants which are potentially important and which may be capable of meeting a wide range of tastes and gaining acceptability on the world market. Locally, these spices vary considerably in their importance and popularity. Among the most important are <b>African</b> <b>nutmeg</b> or Ariwo, Eru (Xylopia aethiopicum) and Aidon (Tetrapleura tetraptera). These three species are noted for their versatility in the preparation of many local dishes and medicines. Spices from the rain forest The high rain forest region of tropical West Africa contains a wide diversity of spices which are locally important but are less well-known outside the region. Most are found growing in the wild in combination with other forest species including teak (Tectona spp) or baobab (Adansonia digitata). In fact most of the climbing types such as Piper spp. are found growing on such forest species as support. They are rarely cultivated but may exist as deliberately protected stands either on farmland or in the wild. Occasionally some species are introduced as intercrops with arable or cash crops like maize, cassava, cocoa, kolanut and rubber. In most backyard gardens where spices such as Occimum are grown they are interplanted with vegetables such as amaranth, okra and tomato. Many species occur at low population densities (Tetrapleura tetraptera is found at approximately 10 plants per 100 hectares of farmland) and, as a result, the quantity of production is low and prices at local markets can be high. The average market price {{of one of the most}} popular spices Monodora myristica is about US$ 1600 per ton, although there can be a price variation of about 25 - 50 % between peak production and scarcity. As these plant species are not generally cultivated, and are even less commonly studied, they are susceptible to genetic erosion through various human activities including bush burning, deforestation, development of commercial plantations and road construction. Strategy for the future These unfamiliar spice plants must be properly identified and information on their habitats, culture and uses must be disseminated. Deliberate attempts should be made to conserve existing plants and to undertake propagation in order to distribute plant material more widely. At present most spices are used in small quantities either singly or in combination, but more information is needed to determine how to process, preserve and store these materials. Most of the spices can be stored on shelves and keep well enough for 6 - 9 months under ambient conditions, but better processing and packaging would extend shelf-life, which is essential if these products are to be traded or even exported. It is apparent that many African countries have under-exploited plant species whose potential uses and value have yet to be fully realized. Action to protect, research and sustainably exploit these species must be undertaken quickly or it will be too late. An initiative on the conservation of African spices is being undertaken at the National Horticultural Research Institute, Ibadan, Nigeria but a coordinated regional effort would accelerate the rate of progress.
