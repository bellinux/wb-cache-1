No substantial differences in main activation patterns were found between C 7 C 8 and control subjects.

40|$|Blocking is a {{reliable}} cross species learning effect. It {{has been studied}} primarily using classical (Pavlovian) conditioning in which animals come to show their learned anticipation of a biologically significant outcome, typically food or foot shock, through a behavioral conditioned response. This conditioned response often resembles the unconditioned response for the outcome (unconditioned stimulus, UCS) - for example, in Pavlov's original studies, the salivation response to food came to be elicited by a bell, termed the conditioned stimulus (CS), that preceded food delivery. This anticipatory responding allows us to quantify {{the strength of the}} conditioned association. Importantly, classical conditioning is selective to the best predictors of outcomes, raising the possibility that here is a mechanism allowing animals to build up a representation of the causal structure of the environment. In any event, in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>selectivity,</b> the learning mechanism would be overloaded and inefficient.

In fact, the plan selection quality provided by our algorithms is often competitive with those obtained through apriori knowledge of the plan search and optimality spaces. The additional computational overheads incurred by the replacement approach are miniscule in comparison to the expected savings in query execution times.

It is {{prepared}} by chemical modification of 10 -deacetylbacattin III, an inactive precursor compound, and then isolated [2]. Doc {{is a highly}} potent, cytotoxic, and antimitotic agent used {{in the treatment of}} various types of cancers, including metastatic breast, ovarian, prostate, advanced non-small-cell lung, head/neck, and advanced gastric cancers by inhibiting the microtubule depolymerization of free tubulin [3, 4]. Due to its poor water solubility (10 to 20 μg/l), polysorbate 80 has been markedly used to improve the aqueous solubility of Doc [5 – 7]. This currently available, marketed formulation has been associated with the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>selectivity</b> for target tissues, serious dose limiting toxicities, and hypersensitivity reactions, as well as sensory and motor neuropathies that are sometimes severe and irreversible. Previously, various alternative formulations, including NCs, pegylated liposomes, targeted immunoliposomes, Doc-fibrinogen-coated olive oil droplets, and cyclodextrins [8 – 15] have been intensively developed for the delivery of Doc. However, the nanosized polymeric nanoparticles represent promising drug-delivery systems which have some advantages such as biodegradability, good biocompatibility, non-toxicity, higher stability, and controlled drug delivery. Polymeric nanoparticles (nanospheres and NCs) not only maintain a prolonged circulation time in the body (especially when pegylated) by avoiding the reticuloendothelial system, but also can extravagate and accumulate into the tumor tissue. This is likely due to the reliance of these nanoparticles on passive accumulation through enhanced permeability and retention, which is highly dependent on adequate blood flow to the tumor [16].|$|E
40|$|Broad-range PCR {{is based}} on the {{recognition}} {{that there are a number}} of broadly conserved molecules across a range of many different organisms. rRNA genes, for example, are present in all cellular forms of life, namely the domains Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya (163). rRNA genes possess highly conserved regions that are suitable as sites for PCR primers that recognize large, diverse groups of organisms (e. g., all members of the Bacteria) and possess variable regions that provide distinct signatures for identification at phylogenetic levels below the level initially targeted by the primers. Commonly, broad-range PCR are aimed at mem-bers of the domain Bacteria, although broad-range PCRs have also been developed for other large relevant groups of organisms or combinations of such groups. For example, broad-range PCRs may target Eukarya (91, 119), Archaea (1, 4, 143), Eukarya and Archaea (10), fungi (70, 130, 159), or fungi and protists (44). Fungal broad-range PCRs are often termed panfungal PCRs in the medical literature. Be-low the level of broad groups of organisms, PCRs may be constructed to target organisms at various other phyloge-netic levels; for example, within the Bacteria it is possible to design phylum-, family-, or genus-specific PCRs, de-pending on the availability of phylogenetically informative signature sequences. The strength of broad-range PCR for diagnostic micro-biology lies in the relative <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>selectivity,</b> assuming little or no prior knowledge of an infecting organism, so that—in principle—any bacterium (in the case of bacterial assays) can be detected and identified.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The LL- 37 {{antimicrobial}} peptide is {{the only}} cathelicidin peptide found in humans that has antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties. Because it exerts also chemotactic and angiogenetic activity, LL- 37 is involved in promoting wound healing, reducing inflammation, and strengthening the host immune response. The key {{to the effectiveness of}} antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) lies in the different compositions of bacterial versus host cell membranes. In this context, antimicrobial peptide LL- 37 and two variants were studied in the presence of model membranes with different lipid compositions and charges. The investigation was performed using an experimental strategy that combines the site-directed spin labeling−electron paramagnetic resonance technique with circular dichroism and fluorescence emission spectroscopies. LL- 37 interacts with negatively charged membranes forming a stable aggregate, which can likely produce toroidal pores until the amount of bound peptide exceeds a critical concentration. At the same time, we have clearly detected an aggregate with a higher oligomeric degree for interaction of LL- 37 with neutral membranes.

The whole set of results indicates that the polymer-rich phase forming the cross-link domains of these sPS gels is a crystalline clathrate phase.

We have measured simplified psychoacoustic tuning curves in nine such listeners, using sinusoidal probes at 125 and 250 Hz, and 80 -Hz wide narrow-band noise maskers. Two listeners showed PTCs at 125 and 250 Hz whose shapes were independent of probe frequency and parallel to their absolute thresholds, indicating the complete <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> frequency <b>selectivity.</b> Seven listeners showed evidence <b>of</b> frequency <b>selectivity</b> at 125 or 250 Hz or at both frequencies; at 250 Hz, frequency selectivity {{was evident in the}} six listeners whose 250 -Hz hearing level was 95 dB or less, but not in the listeners with 250 Hz hearing levels above 95 dB. Where conventional 'v'-shaped PTCs were observed, estimated 3 -dB auditory filter bandwidths were two to three times larger than those typically found in normal listeners. Notched-noise masking results at 250 Hz from the least hearing-impaired listener gave an estimated 3 -dB bandwidth in reasonable agreement with that from the same listener's PTC data. Listeners who retain some frequency selectivity are able to make some use of first formant information in vowel identification, and preliminary results from one patient showed the ability to distinguish a variety of noise spectra. Both of these abilities could be of potential importance as a basis for the recoding of speech spectral patterning through stimulation matched to the listener's residual frequency selectivity...|$|R

Stable continuous tuning over a spectral range of 4 nm has been obtained at telecom wavelengths by adjusting the ambient temperature. OCIS codes: 140. 3570 (Lasers, single-mode), 140. 5960 (Semiconductor lasers), 130. 3990 (Micro-optical devices) Single mode tunable semiconductor lasers are key components for numerous applications ranging from spectroscopy and optical communications, to metrology and beam-steering. Due to the inherent large gain bandwidth of semiconductors, efficiently controlling {{the total number of}} oscillating longitudinal modes in this class of laser is generally challenging. Nevertheless, single frequency lasing has been demonstrated using distributed feedback (DFB) arrangements [1], distributed Bragg reflectors (DBR) or via the integration of passive resonator segments and active gain in a large common laser cavity [2]. However, despite the remarkable success of these techniques in providing wavelength selectivity in a number of configurations, they cannot be readily applied to microring configurations- a prominent class of semiconductor lasers with high prospects for integrated photonics. In the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> wavelength <b>selectivity,</b> spectral tuning techniques like temperature adjustment are also ineffective as they may cause mode hopping and instabilities. This has motivated some of the recent works exploring alternative designs to enforce single mode lasing in such microring resonators [3, 4, 5]...|$|R

Its capture is carried out only by hooks, as mesh gears are forbidden either for professional or for recreational fishing. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine selectivity for different hook sizes used in P. mesopotamicus fishing and to verify which sizes capture only adults. Data were collected in the rivers Miranda, Aquidauana, and Vermelho, in January, March, and April 2002. Six longlines with eight hook sizes were used and we adopted the hook opening as a measure related to selectivity. Different hooks captured individuals of the same length and their medians were similar, evidencing the great overlap among sizes. Regression results showed no significant relationship between ln[c 2 (l) /c 1 (l) ] and total length of captured individuals. In addition, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test also did not detect significant differences in the size of captured fish.

Reverse correlation techniques applied to recordings from the primary auditory cortex of guinea pigs and rats in response to RDS stimulation revealed the variety of temporal dynamics of acoustic patterns evoking an enhanced or suppressed firing rate.

Flight behaviors facilitating these migrations include: (i) selection of seasonally-favorable tailwinds; (ii) flying at the altitude of the fastest winds; (iii) adopting flight headings that partially counteract crosswind drift; and (iv) seasonal reversal of preferred directions between {{spring and fall}}. In the UK, radar measurements indicate that migratory activity is pronounced during the spring and fall, but is usually very low during midsummer (July). However, an atypically intense period of high-altitude flight was recorded during July 2006, and {{in this study we}} compare the flight behavior of A. gamma during these midsummer movements with the more typical spring and fall migrations. During July 2006, activity was most intense at significantly lower altitudes than occurred in spring or fall, and was not associated with the height of the fastest winds; consequently displacement speeds were significantly slower. The most striking difference was an <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> tailwind <b>selectivity</b> in July with windborne movements occurring on almost every night of the month and on tailwinds from all directions. Finally, orientation behavior was quantitatively different during July, with significantly greater dispersion of flight headings and displacements than observed in spring and fall. We discuss mechanisms which could have caused these differences, and conclude that a lack of appropriate photoperiod cues during development of the summer generation resulted in randomly-oriented ‘dispersive’ movements that were strikingly different from typical seasonal migrations [Current Zoology 59 (3) : 360 – 370, 2013]...|$|R
40|$|Potassium {{channels}} are a diverse family of integral membrane proteins through which K(+) can pass selectively. There is ongoing {{debate about the}} nature of conformational changes associated with the opening/closing and conductive/nonconductive states of potassium channels. The channels partly exert their function by varying their conductance through a mechanism known as C-type inactivation. Shortly after the activation of K(+) channels, their selectivity filter stops conducting ions at a rate that depends on various stimuli. The molecular mechanism of C-type inactivation has not been fully understood yet. However, the X-ray structure of the KcsA channel obtained in the presence of low K(+) concentration is thought to be representative of a K(+) channel in the C-type inactivated state. Here, extensive, fully atomistic molecular dynamics and free-energy simulations of the low-K(+) KcsA structure in an explicit lipid bilayer are performed to evaluate the stability of this structure and the <b>selectivity</b> <b>of</b> its binding sites. We find that the low-K(+) KcsA structure is stable on the timescale of the molecular dynamics simulations performed, and that ions preferably remain in S 1 and S 4. In the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> ions, the <b>selectivity</b> filter evolves toward an asymmetric architecture, as already observed in other computations of the high-K(+) structure of KcsA and KirBac.

The photon-induced experiments have used tunable vacuum-UV radiation from a synchrotron and threshold photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy for product ion detection, the electron-induced experiments a trochoidal electron monochromator and a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The strengths and limitations of both experiments are contrasted, the main difference being the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> state <b>selectivity</b> in the electron-induced study. The parent cation is not observed in either study, suggesting that its ground electronic state is repulsive following Franck-Condon vertical excitation. The fragment cations SF_ 5 ^+, SF_ 4 Cl^+, SF_ 4 ^+ and SF_ 3 ^+ have been observed in both studies, with reasonable agreement in their threshold appearance energies. Using a variant of threshold photoelectron photoion coincidence spectroscopy applicable when the ground state of the parent cation is repulsive, the first dissociative ionisation energy of SF_ 5 Cl is determined to be 12. 3 ± 0. 2 eV, leading to a value for the adiabatic ionisation energy for the SF_ 5 radical of 9. 92 ± 0. 28 eV. The electron-induced experiment is sensitive to ion-pair production, and onsets for F^+ and Cl^+ production have been observed which are only possible energetically if the accompanying fragments are the anions SF_ 4 Cl^- and SF_ 5 ^-, respectively. A lower limit for the electron affinity of the SF_ 4 Cl radical of 4. 88 eV is determined, a value confirmed by ab initio calculations.

Catch <b>selectivity</b> data associated with four types of fishing gear (trap, gillnet, handline, otter trawl) were then incorporated to examine how r varied with gear type and with F. The resulting fitness functions were then used to estimate the F above which selection would favour early (4 year) rather than delayed (7 year) maturity. This evolutionarily-sensitive threshold, Fevol, identifies a limit reference point somewhat {{similar to those used}} to define overfishing (e. g., Fmsy, F 0. 1). Over-exploitation of northern cod resulted in fishing mortalities considerably greater than those required to effect evolutionary change. Selection for early maturity is reduced by the dome-shaped <b>selectivities</b> characteristic <b>of</b> fixed gears such as handlines (the greater the leptokurtosis, the lower the probability of a selection response) and enhanced by the knife-edged <b>selectivities</b> <b>of</b> bottom trawls. Strategies to minimize genetic change are consistent with traditional management objectives (e. g., yield maximization, population increase).

As a workaround a replication study was performed that compares the distributional characteristics of firms in the original sample and in the KombiFiD agreement sample, and that uses both data sets to estimate identically specified empirical models (see Wagner 2012). This study shows that results from empirical investigations for enterprises from West Germany (but not from East Germany) based on the KombiFiD sample are very similar to results computed with the original data. Therefore, the KombiFiD sample can be regarded as a sound data base for empirical studies on West German firms from manufacturing industries.|$|R

Previous work, which has been predominantly correlational, {{has focused on the}} effect <b>of</b> <b>selectivity</b> policies on widening university access for individuals from ethnic minorities and disadvantaged backgrounds. Our evaluation method applies a difference-indifference (DD) design, which, under the assumption that the trends of the outcome variables would be the same across all departments within the same university in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> treatment, identifies the causal impact <b>of</b> <b>selectivity</b> policies. The estimates indicate that selectivity schemes may not lead university students to achieve better outcomes, in terms of greater likelihoods of completing their degrees, obtaining top marks and finishing their studies within the required minimum period. The study concludes with a discussion of the main findings and their implications. © 2011 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
40|$|The second-order {{statistics}} of neural activity was examined {{in a model}} of the cat LGN and V 1 during free-viewing of natural images. In the model, the specific patterns of thalamocortical activity required for a Bebbian maturation of direction-selective cells in VI were found during the periods of visual fixation, when small eye movements occurred, but not when natural images were examined in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> fixational eye movements. In addition, simulations of stroboscopic reming that replicated the abnormal pattern of eye movements observed in kittens chronically exposed to stroboscopic illumination produced results consistent with the reported loss <b>of</b> direction <b>selectivity</b> and preservation <b>of</b> orientation <b>selectivity.</b> These results suggest the involvement of the oculomotor activity of visual fixation in the maturation <b>of</b> cortical direction <b>selectivity...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Bivalvia is an {{important}} benthic clade that was relatively less affected than other benthos during the Permian–Triassic (P–Tr) biotic crisis, reporting losses of 85 %, 64 %, and 32 % at the species, genus and family levels, respectively. This clade proliferated immediately after the P–Tr mass extinction (PTME) {{to become one of}} the key elements of the ‘Modern Evolutionary Fauna’ following the P–Tr ‘Great Dying’. Global bivalve occurrence data demonstrate that the initial recovery started in the Griesbachian, a substage immediately after the PTME, and are characterized by relatively high origination and low extinction rates. Thus, unlike other fossil groups, bivalves did not significantly engage in the survival interval. The initial Griesbachian recovery is followed by a stepwise recovery during the Dienerian to Spathian. Then, a remarkably rapid radiation occurred in the Anisian, indicated by extremely high proportional origination and extinction rates. Infaunalization has long been considered the most significant adaptation during the Mesozoic Marine Revolution (MMR), which was thought to have commenced in the Early–Middle Triassic. However, the proportion of infauna in communities remained virtually unchanged before and after the P–Tr biotic crisis; additionally there was no significant difference in proportional extinction/origination rates between infaunal and epifaunal taxa at the genus and family levels through the entire P–Tr transition, implying the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> ecological <b>selectivity,</b> a conclusion that differs from some previous studies. Therefore, if escalating predatory pressure indeed played a crucial role in driving the initial phases of the MMR, infaunalization was not marked prior to the Ladinian. Alternatively, infaunalization may have played a minor role in facilitating the MMR during the entire era. If so, changes in the physical and chemical environment (‘Court Jester’ model) (i. e. amelioration of marine environments in late Early Triassic), rather than biotic processes (‘Red Queen’ model), may be crucial for the origination and initial phases of the MMR during the early Mesozoic...|$|R
40|$|Solvent free {{oxidation}} of {{benzyl alcohol}} {{was investigated in}} the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> a base using Au catalysts prepared by sol immobilization on titania and carbon supports. Comparison between the Au supported catalysts revealed that activity and distribution of products was dependent {{on the nature of}} support and heat treatment. Specifically, heat pre-treatment of the Au catalysts has a beneficial effect in terms of activity, but is detrimental in terms <b>of</b> <b>selectivity</b> to the benzaldehyde. We conclude that sol immobilization is a suitable technique for preparing gold catalysts with small particle size and narrow particle size distributions and very high activity and selectivity for benzyl alcohol oxidation...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{investigated}} the processing of auditory cues for sound localization in the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus). Previous {{studies have shown that}} the barn owl, whose ears are asymmetrically oriented in the vertical plane, has a 2 -dimensional, topographic representation of auditory space in the external division of the inferior colliculus (ICx). As in the barn owl, the great horned owl's ICx is anatomically distinct and projects to the optic tectum. Neurons in ICx respond over only a small range of azimuths (mean = 32 degrees), and azimuth is topographically mapped. In contrast to the barn owl, the great horned owl has bilaterally symmetrical ears and its receptive fields are not restricted in elevation. The binaural cues available for sound localization were measured both with cochlear microphonic recordings and with a microphone attached to a probe tube in the auditory canal. Interaural time disparity (ITD) varied monotonically with azimuth. Interaural intensity differences (IID) also changed with azimuth, but the largest IIDs were less than 15 dB, and the variation was not monotonic. Neither ITD nor IID varied systematically with changes in the vertical position of a sound source. We used dichotic stimulation to determine the sensitivity of ICx neurons to these binaural cues. Best ITD of ICx units was topographically mapped and strongly correlated with receptive-field azimuth. The width of ITD tuning curves, measured at 50 % of the maximum response, averaged 72 microseconds. All ICx neurons responded only to binaural stimulation and had nonmonotonic IID tuning curves. Best IID was weakly, but significantly, correlated with best ITD (r = 0. 39, p less than 0. 05). The IID tuning curves, however, were broad (mean 50 % width = 24 dB), and 67 % of the units had best IIDs within 5 dB of 0 dB IID. ITD tuning was sensitive to variations in IID in the direction opposite to that expected for time-intensity trading, but the magnitude of this effect was only 1. 5 microseconds/dB IID. We conclude that, in the great horned owl, the spatial <b>selectivity</b> <b>of</b> ICx neurons arises primarily from their ITD tuning. Except for the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> elevation <b>selectivity</b> and the narrow range of best IIDs, ICx in the great horned owl appears to be organized much the same as in the barn owl...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} problems encountered with an emulsion/membrane bioreactor. In this reactor, enzyme- (lipase) catalyzed hydrolysis in an emulsion was {{combined with}} two in-line separation steps. One {{is carried out}} with a hydrophilic membrane, to separate the water phase, the other with a hydrophobic membrane, to separate the oil phase. In the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> enzyme, sunflower oil/water emulsions with an oil fraction between 0. 3 and 0. 7 could be separated with both membranes operating simultaneously. However, two problems arose with emulsions containing lipase. First, the flux through both the hydrophilic and the hydrophobic membranes decreased with exposure to the enzyme. Second, the hydrophobic membrane showed a loss <b>of</b> <b>selectivity</b> demonstrated by permeation of both the oil phase and the water phase through the hydrophobic membrane at low transmembrane pressure. These phenomena {{can be explained by}} protein (i. e. lipase) adsorption to the polymer surface within the pores of the membrane. It was proven that lipase was present at the hydrophilic membrane and that this, in part, explains the flux decrease of the hydrophilic membrane. To prevent the observed loss <b>of</b> <b>selectivity</b> with exposure to protein, the hydrophobic polypropylene membrane (Enka) was modified with block copolymers of propylene oxide (PO) and ethylene oxide (EO). These block copolymers act as a steric hindrance for proteins that come near the surface. The modification was successful: After 10 days of continuous operation the minimum transmembrane pressure at which water could permeate through an F 108 -modified membrane was 0. 5 bar, the same value as that observed {{in the beginning of the}} experiment. This indicates that loss <b>of</b> <b>selectivity</b> due to protein adsorption is prevented by the modification of the membrane...|$|R
40|$|The {{liquid phase}} {{oxidation}} of cyclohexane was undertaken using Au/MgO {{and the reaction}} mechanism was investigated by means of continuous wave (CW) EPR spectroscopy employing the spin trapping technique. Activity tests aimed to determine the conversion and <b>selectivity</b> <b>of</b> Au/MgO catalyst showed that Au was capable <b>of</b> <b>selectivity</b> control to cyclohexanol formation up to 70 %, but this {{was accompanied by a}} limited enhancement in conversion when compared with the reaction in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> catalyst. In contrast, when radical initiators were used, in combination with Au/MgO, an activity comparable to that observed in industrial processes at ca. 5 % conversion was found, with retained high selectivity. By studying the free radical autoxidation of cyclohexane and the cyclohexyl hydroperoxide decomposition in the presence of spin traps, we show that Au nanoparticles are capable of an enhanced generation of cyclohexyl alkoxy radicals, and the role of Au is identified as a promoter of the catalytic autoxidation processes, therefore demonstrating that the reaction proceeds via a radical chain mechanism...|$|R
