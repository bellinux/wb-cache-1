5|$|In May 1948, Muir S. Fairchild {{was made}} vice {{chief of staff}} of the USAF. In light of the {{developing}} Cold War <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of Soviet long-range bombers, Fairchild determined that Saville's expertise was critically needed. Fairchild ordered Saville, the top U.S. authority on air defense and a scientifically minded pragmatist, to return stateside in June 1948, for assignment to the ADC headquarters at Mitchel Air Force Base.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Singapore went through some post-independence crises, {{including}} the SARS outbreak in 2003 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of terrorism. In December 2001, {{a plot to}} bomb embassies and other infrastructure in Singapore was uncovered {{and as many as}} 36 members of the Jemaah Islamiyah group were arrested under the Internal Security Act. Major counter-terrorism measures were put in place to detect and prevent potential terrorist acts and to minimise damages should they occur. More emphasis was placed on promoting social integration and trust between the different communities.|$|E
5|$|Initially the {{depression}} was forecast to move ashore as a minimal tropical storm, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of {{the depression}} prompted state of emergency declarations in Mississippi and Louisiana. It was the first tropical cyclone to threaten the New Orleans area since Hurricane Katrina and the destructive 2005 hurricane season. Overall impact from the cyclone was minor and largely limited to light rainfall. However, the precursor system spawned a damaging tornado in Eustis, Florida, where 20houses were destroyed and 30more were damaged.|$|E

5|$|The defections to the Mexican league <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of {{a strike}} by the Pirates {{prompted}} owners {{to form an}} advisory committee, chaired by Larry MacPhail, to suggest needed changes that would calm the discontent among the players. On August 27, 1946, the committee presented a draft a document outlining the changes. Language in the original draft admitted that baseball was operating as a monopoly and that racial bias was the sole reason for segregation in baseball. Baseball's attorneys stripped this controversial language from the version eventually adopted by the owners.|$|E

5|$|A {{war with}} Serbia in 1331–1334 proved less {{successful}} for the Emperor when several towns in Macedonia were {{captured by the}} Serbs, led by the renegade Syrgiannes Palaiologos. These gains were only curtailed when the assassination of Syrgiannes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of a Hungarian invasion forced the Serbian ruler, Stefan Dušan, to seek a negotiated settlement. The subsequent peace treaty concluded between Andronikos III and Dušan was important {{for the future of}} Byzantine-Serbian relations. For the first time, the Byzantines recognized the extensive gains the Serbs had made at the Empire's expense in the central Balkans during Andronikos II's reign. In the aftermath of the pact, Dušan also moved his seat, and with it his realm's centre of gravity, south to Prilep.|$|E
5|$|After Colonel Brigg's {{death in}} 1900, the castle {{passed into the}} hands of the Wearmouth Coal Company about 1908, and from there to the National Coal Board. Due to the {{expansion}} of Sunderland in the 1940s, the castle became surrounded by housing estates including those of Castletown and Hylton Castle. The castle was vandalised and had the lead from its roof stolen. In 1950, due to local pressure <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of demolition, the castle and chapel were taken into the care of the Ministry of Works. Due to the advanced decay of the 19th-century alterations, the ministry removed all internal partitions and consolidated the shell to reveal the remaining medieval masonry. The ministry also appointed a full-time custodian and replaced the missing lead roof with roofing felt to make the site waterproof.|$|E

5|$|After {{the start}} of World War I in August 1914, Wittelsbach was brought back to active duty in the IV Battle Squadron. The ship saw limited duty in the Baltic Sea, {{including}} during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915, but she saw no combat with Russian forces. By late 1915, crew shortages <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> from British submarines forced the Kaiserliche Marine to withdraw older battleships like Wittelsbach. The ship then saw service in auxiliary roles, first as a training ship {{and then as a}} ship's tender. After the war, she was converted into a tender for minesweepers in 1919. In July 1921, the ship was sold and broken up for scrap metal.|$|E
5|$|Before Hurricane Patricia arrived, the Government of Mexico issued {{multiple}} {{watches and}} warnings for coastal communities. A hurricane watch was first raised at 09:00UTC on October21, encompassing areas of Michoacán, Colima, and Jalisco. A tropical storm watch also covered portions of Guerrero. As Patricia intensified, the government issued a hurricane warning for areas between Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco, and Punta San Telmo, Michoacán; {{a tropical storm}} warning supplemented this for areas farther north and east. The hurricane warning was extended northward to include areas south of San Blas, Nayarit, on October23. Once the storm moved inland <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of damaging winds diminished, these warnings were gradually discontinued on October24.|$|E
5|$|By late 1915, crew {{shortages}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> from British submarines {{forced the}} Kaiserliche Marine to withdraw older battleships like Braunschweig, and {{she spent the}} rest of the war first as a headquarters ship, then as a training ship, and finally as a barracks ship. Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, she was retained after the end of the war and modernized in 1921–22. Braunschweig served in the reformed Reichsmarine, where she operated as the flagship of naval forces assigned to the North Sea. She made several cruises abroad, including a voyage into the Atlantic in 1924. The ship was decommissioned again in January 1926 and was stricken from the naval register in March 1931, hulked, and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|Chauvel gained another {{important}} {{success in the}} Battle of Rafa in January 1917. In many ways, the battle was similar to Magdhaba, but the Turkish position was stronger <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of its reinforcement was greater. Once again, the availability of water was a crucial feature of the battle. This time it was Chetwode who decided to call off the battle, with Chauvel's concurrence, but once again the troops carried the day. The victories at Magdhaba and Rafah changed Murray's mind about awarding Chauvel a knighthood and in January 1917 Chauvel was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. In July, he was mentioned in despatches for these operations.|$|E
5|$|Common to all {{crimes against}} {{the person is}} the {{infringement}} {{of the right to}} bodily integrity. It extends to the touching of clothing, for example, and where no physical harm actually results. However, if all touchings were criminalised, this would interfere with the right to liberty. It is the very touching, and not the harm, that is the violation of principle. This is related to the right to privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The central statute on this topic is Offences against the Person Act 1861, which brought together a multitude of difference offences, with much overlap and inconsistent terminology. These include both the actual infliction <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> of violence. Although criticised, the Act has not been replaced.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{accounts}} of the Irish annals, English and Scandinavian writers appear to see Mac Bethad as the rightful king of Moray: this is clear from their descriptions of the meeting with Cnut in 1027, before the death of Malcolm mac Máil Brigti. Malcolm was followed as king or earl by his brother Gillecomgan, husband of Gruoch, a granddaughter of King Kenneth III. It has been supposed that Mac Bethad {{was responsible for the}} killing of Gille Coemgáin in 1032, but if Mac Bethad had a cause for feud in the killing of his father in 1020, Malcolm too had reason to see Gille Coemgáin dead. Not only had Gillecomgan's ancestors killed many of Malcolm's kin, but Gillecomgan and his son Lulach might be rivals for the throne. Malcolm had no living sons, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> to his plans for the succession was obvious. As a result, the following year Gruoch's brother or nephew, who might have eventually become king, was killed by Malcolm.|$|E
