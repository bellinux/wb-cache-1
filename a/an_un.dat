The standards are set by the ILO, which is <b>an</b> <b>UN</b> agency that 185 of the 193 UN members are part of. Labor standards vary greatly depending on host country regulations and enforcement. One of the main reasons for the large differences in labor standards {{is due to the fact}} that ILO only can register complaints and not impose sanctions on governments.|$|E

25|$|When the PLAAF officially {{entered the}} air war over Korea in September 1951, Zhang's 4th Aviation Division was the first PLAAF unit sent into combat, and it was {{under the command of}} the Soviet 64th Aviation Corps. The 4th Aviation Division was {{stationed}} at Langtou Airfield in Liaoning Province, and it was composed of 55 MiG-15s. Zhang first entered two aerial engagements with no victory, but he soon claimed his first victory on October 16, 1951.

2500|$|Another example: the {{sentence}} that in correct literary Arabic must be pronounced Aḥmadu zawjun sharrīr [...] "Ahmad is a wicked husband", is usually mispronounced (due to influence from vernacular Arabic varieties) as Aḥmad zawj sharrīr. Yet, {{for the purposes}} of Arabic grammar and orthography, is treated as if it were not mispronounced and as if yet another word followed it, i.e., if adding any vowel marks, they must be added as if the pronunciation were Aḥmadu zawjun sharrīrun with a tanwīn 'un' at the end. So, it is correct to add <b>an</b> <b>un</b> tanwīn sign on the final r, but actually pronouncing it would be a hypercorrection. Also, it is never correct to write a sukūn on that r, even though in actual pronunciation it is (and in correct Arabic MUST be) sukūned.|$|E

2500|$|According to Peter Braunstein, the [...] "massive {{quantities}} of drugs ingested in discotheques produced the next cultural {{phenomenon of the}} disco era: rampant promiscuity and public sex. While the dance floor was the central arena of seduction, actual sex usually {{took place in the}} nether regions of the disco: bathroom stalls, exit stairwells, and so on. In other cases the disco became a kind of 'main course' in a hedonist's menu for a night out." [...] At The Saint nightclub, a high percentage of the gay male dancers and patrons would have sex in the club; they typically had unprotected sex, because in 1980, HIV-AIDS had not yet been identified. At The Saint, [...] "...dancers would elope to <b>an</b> <b>un</b> upstairs balcony to engage in sex." [...] The promiscuity and public sex at discos was part of a broader trend towards exploring a freer sexual expression in the 1970s, an era that is also associated with [...] "swingers clubs, hot tubs, [...] key parties." ...|$|E
