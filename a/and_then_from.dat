5|$|Conisbrough Castle {{was bought}} by the Conisbrough local council in the 1940s, who placed the castle into the {{guardianship}} of the Ministry of Public Works in 1949, but retained the freehold ownership of the land.

By 1984, when the government agency English Heritage took over the management of the property, the condition of the visitor services was unsatisfactory and the industrial character of the surrounding area was discouraging tourists.|$|E

5|$|Firearms {{remained}} {{in use in}} China throughout the following centuries. Meanwhile, gunpowder and firearms spread elsewhere very quickly. Gunpowder {{seems to have been}} widely known by the 13th century. The Europeans, Arabs, and Koreans all obtained firearms in the 14th century. The Turks, Iranians, and Indians all got firearms no later than the 15th century, in each case directly or indirectly from the Europeans. The Japanese did not acquire firearms until the 16th century, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>from</b> the Portuguese rather than the Chinese.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, as a Second Division side, Sunderland {{reached the}} FA Cup Final, where {{they beat the}} cup-holders Leeds United. A first half goal by Scotsman Ian Porterfield was the only goal of the game.

At {{the end of the}} game Sunderland manager Stokoe ran onto the pitch to embrace his goalkeeper, a gesture perpetuated by the statue currently standing outside the Stadium of Light. Only two other clubs, Southampton in 1976, and West Ham United in 1980, have since equalled Sunderland's achievement of lifting the FA Cup while playing outside the top tier of English football.|$|E
5|$|In North America, the {{original}} Jefferson flock of Shetlands did not persist. Other importations {{were made at}} the beginning of the twentieth century most notably to Mrs. W.W. Burch of Coopersville, MI (wife of the Editor of the American Sheep Breeder at the time), and Mr. L.V. Harkness of the Walnut Hall (the same of Standardbred Horse fame). There is record of these flocks surviving until 1916, and also record of another flock in Illinois in 1917. By 1921, it was recorded that Shetlands could not be bought in the U.S. (The Sheep Breeder, 1921). It was not until the mid-twentieth century that Shetlands were imported into Canada, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>from</b> Canada into the United States in the 1980s. Since then, a North American Shetland Sheep Registry has been established, and there are now thousands of the breed in the region.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of the {{following}} year, steps began to make coin operation, via a nickel slot, part of {{the mechanics of the}} viewing system. By autumn 1892, the design of the Kinetoscope was essentially complete. The filmstrip, based on stock manufactured first by Eastman, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>from</b> April 1893 onward, by New York's Blair Camera Co., was 35 mm (1 3/8inches) wide; each vertically sequenced frame bore a rectangular image and four perforations on each side. Within a few years, this basic format would be adopted globally as the standard for motion picture film, which it remains to this day. The publication in the October 1892 Phonogram of cinematographic sequences shot in the format demonstrates that the Kinetograph had already been reconfigured to produce movies with the new film.|$|E
