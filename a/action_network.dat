40|$|This work proposes <b>action</b> <b>networks</b> as a semantically well-founded {{framework}} for reasoning about actions and change under uncertainty. <b>Action</b> <b>networks</b> add two primitives to probabilistic causal networks: controllable variables and persistent variables. Controllable variables allow {{the representation of}} actions as directly setting the value of specific events in the domain, subject to preconditions. Persistent variables provide a canonical model of persistence according to which both the state of a variable and the causal mechanism dictating its value persist over time unless intervened upon by an action (or its consequences). <b>Action</b> <b>networks</b> also allow different methods for quantifying the uncertainty in causal relationships, which go beyond traditional probabilistic quantification. This paper describes both recent results and work in progress. Comment: Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI 1994...|$|R
