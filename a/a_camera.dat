However, <b>a</b> tracking-based <b>camera</b> view does not mimic a human operator naturally. To address this issue, we propose a new learning algorithm to automatically generate <b>a</b> professional virtual <b>camera</b> view by learning {{the behavior of}} <b>a</b> human <b>camera</b> operator. Our algorithm {{is based on a}} human saliency model which predicts the viewer’s center-of-attention and additional features which drive the cinematic decision-making process of the system. Experimental result reveals our system can provide <b>an</b> effective <b>camera</b> view that is almost indistinguishable from <b>a</b> humangenerated <b>camera</b> view. 1...|$|R

Barbara Schweger, an Arctic clothing specialist, and Roger Amy, a pathologist, assisted in the investigation.|$|E
5|$|A scene {{featuring}} multiple clones of {{the character}} Kurt Crawford was achieved with motion control photography, allowing actor David Lovgren to portray all of the clones—multiple takes were recorded with the actor in different positions within the scene, and by using <b>a</b> <b>camera</b> controlled by a computer to follow exactly the same motions for each take, these could be seamlessly composited together. Producer Paul Rabwin has noted that achieving these shots was difficult due to the mixture of green and blue light sources in the scene.|$|E

5|$|Conversely, reviewers noted a lack {{of support}} for {{expandable}} storage, the initial absence of cellular connectivity, and the display's lower-than-expected contrast level, {{as well as an}} absence of a rear-facing camera. For the latter, an explanation from Asus claimed that the company decided to omit such <b>a</b> <b>camera</b> so as to not compromise the user experience and competitive pricing.

We show that a minimal requirement for <b>an</b> affine <b>camera</b> to mimic perspective projection leads to <b>a</b> unique <b>camera</b> model, which we call <b>a</b> symmetric affine <b>camera,</b> which has two free functions.

5|$|Frawley, {{who also}} served as cinematographer for the film, had a relaxed {{approach}} to making films; he did not use screenplays and never numbered the scenes.
