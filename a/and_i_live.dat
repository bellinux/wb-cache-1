They became close friends and eventually came to live together. Stoltenberg wrote a series of radical feminist books and articles on masculinity. Although Dworkin publicly wrote [...] "I love John with my heart and soul" [...] and Stoltenberg described Dworkin as [...] "the love of my life", she continued to publicly identify herself as lesbian, and he as gay. Stoltenberg, recounting the perplexity that their relationship seemed to cause people in the press, summarized the relationship by saying, [...] "So I state only the simplest facts publicly: yes, Andrea <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> together and love each other and we are each other's life partner, and yes we are both out." ...|$|E

500|$|Harriet Fane married Rt Hon Charles Arbuthnot, {{member of}} Parliament, at Fulbeck on 31 January 1814. [...] Born in 1767, {{her husband was}} 26 {{years older than she}} was, an age {{difference}} which had initially caused her family to object to the marriage. Another of the principal obstacles to finalising the arrangements for the marriage was financial. Her widowed mother delegated the arrangements for the marriage of her 20-year-old daughter to her elder son Vere, a 46-year-old widower who was considered qualified in these matters as he worked at Child's Bank. [...] It seems that Vere Fane and his mother were not initially prepared to settle enough money on his sister to satisfy her future husband, causing the prospective bridegroom to write to his fiancée: [...] "How can you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> upon £1000 or £1200 and Fane [...] finds it so impossible to live upon her £6000 that she can offer you no assistance whatsoever?" ...|$|E
500|$|On his {{spectrum}} of theistic probability, which has seven levels between 1 (100% {{belief in a}} God) and 7 (100% belief that gods do not exist), Dawkins has said he's a 6.9, which represents a [...] "de facto atheist" [...] who thinks [...] "I cannot know for certain but I think God is very improbable, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> my life {{on the assumption that}} he is not there." [...] When asked about his slight uncertainty, Dawkins quips, [...] "I am agnostic to the extent that I am agnostic about fairies {{at the bottom of the}} garden." [...] In May 2014, at the Hay Festival in Wales, Dawkins explained that while he does not believe in the supernatural elements of the Christian faith, he still has nostalgia for the ceremonial side of religion. In addition to beliefs in deities, Dawkins has criticized other irrational religious beliefs such as Jesus turned water into wine, that an embryo starts as a blob, that magic underwear will protect you, that Jesus was resurrected, that semen comes from the spine, that Jesus walked on water, that the sun sets in a marsh, that the Garden of Eden existed in Missouri, that Jesus' mother was a virgin, that Muhammad split the moon, and that Lazarus was raised from the dead.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{features}} an inspirational message of inner strength, and finds Carey {{reaching out to}} listeners. The song uses a rainstorm {{as a metaphor for}} troubles in life, while encouraging others to [...] "make it through the rain" [...] through perseverance. The first chorus begins: [...] "When you get caught in the rain / With no where to run / When your distraught and in pain without anyone / When you keep crying out to be saved", illustrating a moment in an individual's life where they are surrounded by conflict. The chorus then serves as a guide to those still suffering, [...] "I can make it through the rain, I can stand up once again on my own / And I know that I'm strong enough to mend / And every time I feel afraid I hold tighter to my faith / <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>live</b> one more day and I make it through the rain". Similarly, the second verse once again revisits difficult times when [...] "shadows grow close", before continuing into the second chorus and climax. While the song in meant for listeners to gain confidence and strength, it also allows them into Carey's personal struggles she endured throughout 2001. Lola Ogunnaike of The New York Times described the song as a [...] "triumph over adversity", while a writer from the Sydney Morning Herald wrote [...] "it's an insight into her recent troubles." [...] In an interview with MTV News, Carey described the song's lyrical content in depth: ...|$|E
