5|$|Andrić's {{literary}} {{career began}} in 1911, and {{prior to the}} outbreak of World War I, he published a number of poems, essays and reviews, and also translated the works of foreign writers.

He spent much of World War I in captivity, and was only freed in July 1917, after Emperor Charles declared a general amnesty for political prisoners. Andrić entered the diplomatic service in 1920. Throughout the interwar period, he served as an ambassador of the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia). He published a short story titled The Bridge on the Žepa, which was to serve as a prototype for the Bridge on the Drina, in 1925. In 1939, he was appointed Yugoslavia's ambassador to Germany, which went on to spearhead an invasion of his country in April 1941, within the wider context of World War II. Andrić and his staff were <b>arrested</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Germans following the invasion's commencement, and in June 1941, he was permitted to return to Belgrade.
