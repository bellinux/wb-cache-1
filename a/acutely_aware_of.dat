5|$|She was <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the {{importance}} of promptly publishing her discoveries and thus establishing her priority. Had not Becquerel, two years earlier, presented his discovery to the Académie des Sciences {{the day after he}} made it, credit for the discovery of radioactivity, and even a Nobel Prize, would instead have gone to Silvanus Thompson. Curie chose the same rapid means of publication. Her paper, giving a brief and simple account of her work, was presented for her to the Académie on 12 April 1898 by her former professor, Gabriel Lippmann. Even so, just as Thompson had been beaten by Becquerel, so Curie was beaten in the race to tell of her discovery that thorium gives off rays {{in the same way as}} uranium; two months earlier, Gerhard Carl Schmidt had published his own finding in Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Miller's {{season ended}} early {{after he was}} called back for army service and he was {{stationed}} in the northern suburb of Broadmeadows. However, he had disciplinary problems and disliked taking orders from his officers, whom he often felt were inferior to him. He left the Militia on 8 November 1941. Miller and a friend then attempted to join the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) as stokers. When the navy would not take his friend, Miller tore up his paperwork in protest, left the recruiting office, and walked {{around the corner to}} the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) recruiting office. He was <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the risks, as many of his playing colleagues had been killed, injured or captured. The threat of combat increased when the Pacific Theatre of World War II opened on 7 December 1941 with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The 194142 cricket season was cancelled and many cricket and football grounds were converted into army bases.|$|E
5|$|No formal {{educational}} {{method was}} applied to the production, and no attempt was made to follow the official UK National Curriculum for primary school history. The show's creators were <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> educational possibilities, but—in line with Deary's overall mandate for the franchise—saw their basic role as popularising history, inspiring further curiosity about the academic subject rather than attempting to teach it seriously. The show's effectiveness in this respect was endorsed by historical scholars, including presenter Dan Snow. Writing in The Independent, Gerard Gilbert notes that Horrible Histories is part of an extensive British black-comedy tradition not only in adult but also in children's programming. In later series, as usable material from the books began to run out, there was a progression towards more sophisticated, adult sketches in terms of both creativity and educational content, as the show began relying on material that their younger viewers would be less familiar with.|$|E

50|$|At {{this point}} a stereopticon began {{to project a}} series of images on the screen, after each of which the lenses of the hoodwink were briefly raised and the image was {{explained}} to the initiate. First, a locomotive fireman leaving his family to go to work; then, a train with its crew industriously fulfilling their assigned task. Next came {{an image of a}} train wreck, followed by another of a funeral attended by members of the brotherhood, paying their respects to the deceased. This was followed by an image of a lodge representative relieving the grieving widow with a payment of the organization's death indemnity. Having witnessed his own symbolic death, the new candidate was thus made <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> both <b>of</b> the importance of his own support of families of maimed or fallen brothers in their time of need as well as the confidence that his own family would be provided for should he himself fall to misfortune.|$|R

5000|$|Apart {{from this}} [...] "substratum" [...] of war memory, Klüger made a less emotionally and {{politically}} charged observation that Jewish tradition only allowed male descendents to say Kaddish. This reportedly affected {{her desire to}} use faith {{as a means of}} coping with the Holocaust. She speaks to her gentle repulsion from Judaism, saying, “if it were different, if I could mourn my ghosts in some accepted public way, like saying kaddish for my father, I’d have a friendlier attitude towards this religion...Recipes for gefilte fish are no recipe for coping with the Holocaust.” She also brings light to the fact that war memoirs are a male construct, saying, “wars, and hence the memories of wars, are owned by the male of the species.” Because she’s a woman, she’s <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> that most <b>of</b> her readers will be female. In a chapter on the importance of differentiation, as opposed to generalization ("Christianstadt" [...] as opposed to [...] "death camp"), when confronting the Holocaust, Klüger notes in parentheses: “most of readers are likely to be female, since males, on the whole, tend to prefer books written by fellow males.” ...|$|R

40|$|This WWF report {{seeks to}} answer the question: “Is it {{technically}} possible to meet the growing global demand for energy by using clean and sustainable energy sources and technologies that will protect the global climate? ” In other words, can a concerted shift to the sustainable energy resources and technologies that are available today meet the more than doubling of global energy demand projected by 2050, while avoiding dangerous climatic change {{of more than two}} degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels? The report's conclusion is that the technologies and sustainable energy resources known or available today are sufficient to meet this challenge, and there is still sufficient time to build up and deploy them, but only if the necessary decisions are made in the next five years.

Even before the war, work had begun on an extensive system of public air-raid shelters, but by 1939 only 15% of the planned 2,000 shelters had been built. By 1941, however, the five huge public shelters (Zoo, Anhalt Station, Humboldthain, Friedrichshain and Kleistpark) were complete, offering shelter to 65,000 people. Other shelters were built under government buildings, the best-known being the so-called Führerbunker under the Reich Chancellery building. In addition, many U-Bahn stations were converted into shelters. The {{rest of the population}} had to make do with their own cellars.|$|E

25|$|Maximilian I shared rule {{with his}} father during the latter year of Frederick's reign, being elected King of the Romans in 1486. By {{acquiring}} the lands of the Tyrolean line of the Habsburgs in 1490 he finally reunited all the Austrian lands, divided since 1379.

25|$|Because Shong was illiterate, it is {{sometimes}} assumed that he invented Pahawh ex nihilo. However, Shong was <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> writing and of the advantages that it provided; indeed, that was {{the basis of his}} messianic movement. It would appear that existing scripts provided his inspiration, even if he did not fully understand them, much as the Roman alphabet inspired the illiterate Sequoyah when he invented the Cherokee script, in a process called trans-cultural diffusion. Not only do the forms {{of the majority of the}} letters in the oldest stage of Pahawh closely resemble the letters of the local Lao alphabet and missionary scripts such as Pollard and Fraser, though they are independent in sound value (much like the relationship between Roman and Cherokee), but the appearance of vowel and tone diacritics in those scripts, which would appear nearly random to the illiterate, may explain the idiosyncratic use of diacritics in early Pahawh. Nevertheless, even if the graphic forms of Pahawh letters derive from other scripts, much of the typology of the script, with its primary rimes and secondary onsets, would appear to be Shong's invention.|$|E
25|$|Replaced as Carlist {{political}} leader by marqués de Villores, Larramendi remained {{engaged in the}} party executive; his activity was related to dynastical issues rather than to daily business. In 1922 he represented Don Jaime’s sister, Doña Blanca, in court; wife {{to a member of}} the imperial Habsburg house she refused to recognize the Austrian republic and sought shelter in Spain. Larramendi presented her case when claiming the Spanish citizenship, resulting in a booklet titled Dictamen referente a la nacionalidad de S.A.R. Doña Blanca de Borbón y Borbón. His efforts were crowned with success and Doña Blanca with her family settled in Barcelona. In the future the episode would prove of great value for the Carloctavista dynastic claim, but no source clarifies whether in the early 1920s Larramendi considered her sons would-be claimants to the Spanish throne. It is confirmed, however, that he was <b>acutely</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the looming dynastical crisis. As Don Jaime, at that time in his early 50s, had no offspring, the Carlist branch was endangered with extinction. Larramendi kept advocating last-minute rescue mission by Don Jaime’s marriage with his niece; the scheme crashed when in 1922 Fabiola Massimo married an Italian aristocrat.|$|E

The letter, which addressed Habibullah as [...] "Your Majesty", was intended to encourage Habibullah and make him feel an equal partner in the Empire.
