5|$|Before going {{hunting the}} next day Bertilak proposes a bargain: he will give Gawain {{whatever}} he catches {{on the condition that}} Gawain give him whatever he might gain during the day. Gawain accepts. After Bertilak leaves, Lady Bertilak visits Gawain's bedroom and behaves seductively, but despite her best efforts he yields nothing but a single kiss in his unwillingness to offend her. When Bertilak returns and gives Gawain the deer he has killed, his guest gives a kiss to Bertilak without divulging its source. The next day the lady comes again, Gawain again courteously foils her advances, and later that day there is a similar exchange of a hunted boar for two kisses. She comes once more on the third morning, this time offering Gawain a gold ring as a keepsake. He gently but steadfastly refuses but she pleads that he <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>take</b> her belt, a girdle of green and gold silk which, the lady assures him, is charmed and will keep him from all physical harm. Tempted, as he may otherwise die {{the next day}}, Gawain accepts it, and they exchange three kisses. That evening, Bertilak returns with a fox, which he exchanges with Gawain for the three kisses – but Gawain says nothing of the girdle.|$|E
25|$|Certain modern Buddhists, {{particularly}} in Western countries, reject—or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>take</b> an agnostic stance toward—the concept of rebirth or reincarnation, which {{they view as}} incompatible {{with the concept of}} anatta. Stephen Batchelor discusses this issue in his book Buddhism Without Beliefs. Others point to research that has been conducted at the University of Virginia as proof that some people are reborn.|$|E
25|$|Two barren years followed: 1996 {{was spent}} entirely in Surrey's second team, {{and he was}} {{generally}} expensive even there, regularly going for five runs an over. The following season he played no county cricket at any level, his only appearance of note being in a minor match, for the Earl of Arundel's XI against Ireland in a friendly one-day game in August. He did <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>take</b> 3–39 on that occasion. In 1997, he made 3 Minor Counties Championship appearances for Hertfordshire against Cambridgeshire, Suffolk and Buckinghamshire.|$|E

25|$|Near {{the end of}} his life, Siyyid Kázim {{repeatedly}} instructed {{his followers}} to disperse throughout Persian and surrounding lands in search of the Mahdi. Siyyid Kázim died on 31 December 1843. In the days following Siyyid Kázim's death, a significant number of Shaykis recognized Mullá Husayn as the only worthy successor to Siyyid Kázim and he decided to take up the challenge to search out the promised Mahdi. Some among the followers of Siyyid Kázim expected that Mullá Husayn would declare himself to be the Mahdi, or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>take</b> up leadrship of the Shaykis; he forcefully refuted both suggestions.|$|E
500|$|Flight Unlimited was a {{commercial}} success. It debuted in twelfth {{place on a}} June 1995 sales chart compiled by NPD Group, while Microsoft Flight Simulator 5.1 took first place. The game went on to sell more than 300,000 copies by 1997, and more than 780,000 by 2002. According to Constantine von Hoffman of the Boston Herald, Flight Unlimited successfully competed with Microsoft Flight Simulator. PC Gamers Lee Buchanan wrote that it [...] "soars above the pack of flight simulations", and he considered it to be [...] "the most fun [...] had in a computerized cockpit". Frank Vizard of Popular Mechanics hailed it as [...] "the new top gun of flight simulators", and Doug Bailey of The Boston Globe considered {{it to be the}} [...] "first real serious challenge to Microsoft's dominance of the genre". The Records David Noack believed that the game's physics and stereoscopic terrain set [...] "a new standard in flight simulation". Writing for Computer Gaming World, Bob and John Nolan stated, [...] "If anything, you should <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>take</b> a look at this product, because you'll be looking at the future of simulations." ...|$|E

2500|$|The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals {{held that}} the FCC failed to justify its {{exercise}} of ancillary authority to regulate Internet service providers' network management practices. [...] For an issue to fall within an agency's authority, the agency need only have ancillary authority—a sufficient statutory support requesting the agency <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>take</b> action {{in the first instance}} of the issue. Here, the Court did not find a sufficient statutory basis under the Communications Act of 1934 for the FCC's mandate to regulate the behavior of Internet service providers.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{windows were}} broken at the Römisch-Germanisches Museum in Cologne, Germany by plywood that was {{covering}} a fountain near Cologne Cathedral. The wood caused major {{damage to the}} encasing of a Roman mosaic dating to the 3rd century. The Römisch-Germanisches Museum building was originally constructed around the mosaic. As of January 2007, it is still unclear whether the mosaic has suffered damage, as museum staff have announced the clean-up will <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>take</b> a week due to {{the fragility of the}} exhibit. Museum manager Bernhard Ostermann estimated that the mosaic was damaged in 100 to 150 places ...|$|E

In an {{interview}} with Oprah Winfrey, Grammer stated he could consider forgiving the men involved if they would <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>take</b> responsibility for the crime, but that they all continued to say they had no involvement. In the same interview, Grammer expressed his loss of faith {{for a few years}} after Karen's death. He subsequently forgave Glenn but refused to support the man's release, saying it would [...] "be a betrayal of my sister’s life.” ...|$|E
50|$|The {{legacy of}} The Jack Staulcup Orchestra {{is that it}} {{operated}} continuously for 60 years, when many of its more famous contemporaries disbanded, or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>took</b> a hiatus, <b>at</b> {{the end of the}} big band era. The orchestra provided big band dance music, to a region of the country, where live performances of the genre were otherwise unavailable.|$|R

He wanted her to <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>take</b> some formal training with a professional photographer. [...] "Well, I never had the patience for that," [...] she said. [...] "I had to trust my feelings." [...] She did however study the photography of horses at college in Arizona under Hazel Larsen Archer, and became at that time an avid nature hobbyist, using a high quality Leica camera. A few months after her Rolling Stones shoot, she was allowed back stage at Shea Stadium where the Beatles performed.|$|E
2500|$|... "We {{are really}} asking the Court two things," [...] he continued. The first {{was to take}} the {{presumption}} that illegal use was intended in that kind of marketing, or <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>take</b> judicial notice. The second was in regard to the appeals court's concern about targeting certain lifestyles. [...] "I can't make the argument strong enough that I think under the rational interest of the community and the state {{we have a right to}} legislate against lifestyles, such as homicidal maniacs, burglars, and drug abusers ... We don't like his lifestyle in Hoffman Estates, and I don't think anywhere else in the country do they care for that lifestyle, and I believe we have a right to legislate." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the final}} weeks of the league season, Arsenal emerged as a creditable {{challenger}} to United. Both clubs were also paired together in the semi-final of the FA Cup, decided by a replay as the original game finished goalless. Keane was sent off {{in the second half}} and United conceded a penalty late into the match with the score 1–1. Dennis Bergkamp's effort was saved by Peter Schmeichel. Ferguson hoped his team [...] "could <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>take</b> it to a penalty shoot-out", but instead the match was settled in extra time: Giggs ran the length of the pitch and evaded several Arsenal players to score the winning goal. United went on to beat Newcastle United in the 1999 FA Cup Final and completed the double – a week earlier the team had defeated Tottenham Hotspur to regain the Premier League.|$|E

2500|$|Following battery re-generation {{problems}} {{on his car}} that left him unable to finish the event after having led the first 16 laps, Abt spoke of his annoyance and revealed he had some issues with his first car: [...] "But still {{we were in a}} position to <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>take</b> a podium here which would have been good points. Still good, and then last lap my car shuts off with a battery failure or whatever. It’s annoying." [...] He was also disappointed over losing the possibility of finishing on the podium, but said it was continually satisfying to compete {{at the front of the}} pack but it felt more satisfying to be the first driver to finish the race: [...] "I don’t know why this always happens to me, so many times. It’s just really annoying because in the end people forget what happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the fall}} of Athens, Morosini's {{position}} was not secure. The Ottomans were amassing an army at Thebes, and their 2,000-strong cavalry effectively controlled Attica, limiting the Venetians to the environs of Athens, so that the Venetians had to establish forts to secure the road linking Athens to Piraeus. On 26 December, the 1,400-strong remnant of the Hannoverian contingent departed, and a new outbreak of the plague during the winter further weakened the Venetian forces. The Venetians managed to recruit 500 Arvanites from the rural population of Attica as soldiers, but no Greeks were willing to join the Venetian army. In a council on 31 December, {{it was decided to}} abandon Athens and focus on other projects, such as the conquest of Negroponte. A camp was fortified at the Munychia to cover the evacuation, and it was suggested, but not agreed on, that the walls of the Acropolis should be razed. As the Venetian preparations to leave became evident, many Athenians chose to leave, fearing Ottoman reprisals: 622 families, some 4,000–5,000 people, were evacuated by Venetian ships and settled as colonists in Argolis, Corinthia, Patras, and Aegean islands. Morosini decided to <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>take</b> back a few ancient monuments as spoils, but on 19 March the statues of Poseidon and the chariot of Nike fell down and smashed into pieces as they were being removed from the western pediment of the Parthenon. The Venetians abandoned the attempt to remove further sculptures from the temple, and instead took a few marble lions, including the famous Piraeus Lion, which had given the harbour its medieval name [...] "Porto Leone", and which today stands at the entrance of the Venetian Arsenal. On 10 April, the Venetians evacuated Attica for the Peloponnese.|$|E
