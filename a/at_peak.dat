30|$|The VC-PGA {{model will}} {{take in the}} highest values of {{predicted}} traffic from all cells in the LC. For this reason, only evaluation <b>at</b> <b>peaks</b> will be considered. Once again, as in the overall evaluation, the prediction based on the previous week’s data gives the best results <b>at</b> <b>peaks.</b> The percentage error is only 0 – 2 %, as compared to 0 – 200 % for prediction based on previous half-year’s data and 0 – 400 % for prediction based on subsequent consecutive weeks of particular day. Therefore, the VC-PGA model will run based on prediction using training data of previous week. The VC-PGA model takes in the highest values of predicted traffic from all cells in the LC. For this reason, only evaluation <b>at</b> <b>peaks</b> is significant. Once again, as in the overall evaluation, the prediction based on the previous week’s data gives the best results <b>at</b> <b>peaks.</b> Most importantly, the number of calls dropped was shown to decrease for all experiments. The percentage {{decrease in the number}} of calls dropped was largest for Experiments 3 and 4. Thus, assuming a large portion of calls dropped is due to coverage holes, it has been proven that the proposed model controls cell attenuation efficiently to reduce the number of calls dropped.|$|R

5|$|Late on 10April, {{the center}} of Olivia passed near Barrow Island <b>at</b> <b>peak</b> intensity.

Accelerating to the southeast, the storm became disorganized and winds decreased below hurricane-force. During the afternoon of 11April, Olivia weakened to a tropical low over southern Australia. It moved over the Great Australian Bight and lost its identity as a gale-force low on 12April, after it was absorbed by a trough.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the strongest}} {{recorded}} tropical cyclones weakened prior to their eventual landfall or demise.

The 1935Labor Day hurricane made landfall <b>at</b> <b>peak</b> intensity, making it the most intense Atlantic landfall. Though it weakened slightly before its eventual landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula, Hurricane Gilbert maintained a pressure of 900mbar (hPa; 26.58inHg) at landfall, making its landfall the second strongest. Similarly, Hurricane Dean made landfall on the peninsula, though it did so <b>at</b> <b>peak</b> intensity and with a higher barometric pressure; its landfall marked the third strongest in Atlantic hurricane history.|$|E

5|$|After {{maintaining}} its intensity for 24 hours, Rachel made landfall <b>at</b> <b>peak</b> intensity near {{the southern tip}} of Baja California Sur.

Rachel dissipated several hours later on October3. By that time, the winds had decreased to 30mph (45km/h). The remnants of Rachel entered the United States, and were last noted over Texas.|$|E

30|$|In starch spectra, {{a strong}} and broad <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> 3423.18 (cm− 1) is {{attributed}} to the characteristic absorption peak of the stretching vibration of O–H.

The <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> 2928.39 (cm− 1) is ascribed to the asymmetric stretching of C–H whose intensity vibration is significantly lessened in the blend format. The <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> 1646.55  cm− 1 is attributed to the adsorbed water. The <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> about 1007.87 (cm− 1) is ascribed to C–O–H stretching.
