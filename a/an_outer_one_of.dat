40|$|We {{explore the}} {{formation}} of dusty gas walls induced by a circumnuclear starburst around an AGN. We concentrate our attention {{on the role of}} the radiation force by a starburst as well as an AGN, where the effects of optical depth of dusty gas are taken into consideration. In two-dimensional axisymmetric space, we analyze the configuration and the stability of geometrically thin walls which are in balance between radiation pressure and gravity. As a result, it is shown that the radiation force by the circumnuclear starburst works to stabilize optically thick walls surrounding the nucleus. In the case of a brighter starburst with a fainter AGN, there form double walls, an inner one of which is located between the nucleus and the circumnuclear starburst, and <b>an</b> <b>outer</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> which enshrouds both the starburst regions and the nucleus. The total extinction (Av) of both walls turns out to be ~ 10 for a brighter starburst. As a consequence, double walls could heavily obscure the nucleus to make the AGN type 2. The outer wall may provide an explanation for the recent indications for large-scale obscuring materials in Seyfert 2 's. Also, it is predicted that the AGN type is shifts from type 2 to type 1 in several times 10 ^ 7 yr according to the stellar evolution in the starburst. In contrast, if the AGN itself is much brighter than the starburst as a quasar is, then neither wall forms regardless of the starburst activity and the nucleus is likely to be identified as type 1. To conclude, the radiatively-supported gas walls could be responsible for the putative correlation between AGN type and the starbursts, whereby Seyfert 2 galaxies are more frequently associated with circumnuclear starbursts than type 1, whereas quasars are mostly observed as type 1 regardless of star-forming activity in the host galaxies.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} generating cuts for mixed integer nonlinear programs where the objective is linear and {{the relations between the}} decision variables are described by convex func-tions defining a convex feasible region. We propose a new method for strengthening the continuous relaxations of such problems using cutting planes. Our method {{can be seen as a}} practical implementation of the lift-and-project technique in the nonlinear case. To derive each cut we use a combination of a nonlinear programming subproblem and <b>a</b> linear <b>outer</b> approximation. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> the main features of the approach is that the subproblems solved to generate cuts are typically not more com-plicated than the original continuous relaxation. In particular they do not require the introduction of additional variables or nonlinearities. We propose several strategies for using the technique and present prelimi-nary computational evidence of its practical interest. In particular, the cuts allow us to improve over the state of the art branch-and-bound of the solver Bonmin, solving more problems in faster computing times on average...|$|R
40|$|Lens models {{appropriate}} for representing cusped galaxies and clusters are developed. The analogue of the odd number theorem for cusped density distributions is given. Density cusps are classified into strong, isothermal or weak, {{according to their}} lensing properties. Strong cusps cause multiple imaging for any source position, whereas isothermal and weak cusps give rise to only one image for distant sources. Isothermal cusps always possess a pseudo-caustic. When the source crosses the pseudo-caustic, {{the number of images}} changes by unity. Two families of cusped galaxy and cluster models are examined in detail. The double power-law family has an inner cusp, followed by a transition region and <b>an</b> <b>outer</b> envelope. <b>One</b> member <b>of</b> this family [...] the isothermal double power-law model [...] possesses an exceedingly scarce property, namely, the lens equation is exactly solvable for any source position. This means that the magnifications, the time delay and the lensing cross-sections are all readily available. The model has a three dimensional density that is cusped like $r^{- 2 }$ at small radii and falls off like $r^{- 4 }$ asymptotically. Thus, it provides a very useful representation of the lensing properties of a galaxy or cluster of finite total mass with a flat rotation curve. The second set of models studied is the single power-law family. These are single density cusps of infinite extent. The properties of the critical curves and caustics and the behaviour of the lenses in the presence of external shear are all discussed in some detail.
