The PSC located 14 places where crossings needed to be eliminated. However, by early 1917, there was barely enough money to build the subway to Flushing, let alone a link to Whitestone and Bayside. A lease agreement was announced on October 16, 1917, but the IRT withdrew from the agreement a month later, citing that it was inappropriate to enter such an agreement at that time.

25|$|The {{wedding was}} notable {{for being the}} first {{marriage}} between a Bonaparte {{and a member of}} a reigning house of Europe since 1859.

5|$|Renovation of Kenilworth Road was {{neglected}} for {{the next}} two decades—financial difficulties and <b>the</b> club's ambitions <b>to</b> build a new ground meant that regeneration was unaffordable, and would also prove unnecessary should relocation occur. However, following the rejection of several potential sites for a new ground, the club finally turned their <b>attentions</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> maintenance of Kenilworth Road. The first real modernisation of the ground came in 1973, with the first addition of seats at the stadium since the construction of the new Main Stand in 1922.

25|$|When the Romans {{breached}} {{the treaty}} in 440, Attila and Bleda attacked Castra Constantias, a Roman fortress and marketplace {{on the banks}} of the Danube. The Eastern Romans stopped delivery of the agreed tribute, and they broke other conditions of the Treaty of Margus. The Hunnic kings turned their <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Romans. Reports that the Bishop of Margus had crossed into Hun lands and desecrated royal graves further angered the Hun kings. War broke out between the two empires, and the Huns overcame a weak Roman army to raze the cities of Margus, Singidunum and Viminacium. Although a truce was signed in 441, two years later Constantinople again failed to deliver the tribute and war resumed. In the following campaign, Hun armies came alarmingly close to Constantinople, sacking Sardica, Arcadiopolis and Philippopolis along the way. Suffering a complete defeat at the Battle of Chersonesus, the Eastern Roman Emperor Theodosius II gave in to Hun demands and in autumn 443 signed the Peace of Anatolius with the two Hun kings. The Huns returned to their lands with a vast train full of plunder.|$|E
500|$|Without {{being in}} any sense retrograde, Robinson's book brought <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plants, which had been eclipsed since the decline of [...] "gardenesque" [...] plantings of the 1820s and 30s, during the use of tender annuals as massed color in {{patterned}} schemes of the mid-century. The book's popularity was largely due to Robinson's promise that wild gardening could be easy and beautiful; {{that the use of}} hardy perennials would be less expensive and offer more variety than the frequent mass planting of greenhouse annuals; and that it followed nature, which he considered the source of all true design.|$|E
50|$|Palm Springs {{had been}} {{awaiting}} Haber's return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> club scene and in January 1994, he obliged {{them with the}} opening of Touche, a $1.3 million Moroccan-themed bar, nightclub and restaurant. More than 500 people showed up on opening night, including Andy Williams, George Hamilton, Connie Stevens, Jack Jones, Engelbert Humperdinck, Marc Lawrence and Jackie Mason. Despite an international plug from Runaway with the Rich and Famous (featuring Robin Leach), a pattern emerged at Touche: Haber was turning people away on weekends, but had no mid-week business. He eventually discovered that people's work and play habits had changed, and that there was also more enlightenment about alcohol and substance abuse through the media. Haber sold Touche in 1996 for $250,000 and returned his <b>attentions</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Ingleside Inn and Melvyn's, which were still thriving.|$|R

500|$|In his {{introduction}} to the trial, Potts writes; [...] "Thus have we for a time left the Graund Witches of the Forrest of Pendle, to the good consideration of a very sufficient jury." [...] Bromley had by then heard the cases against the three Pendle witches who had confessed to their guilt, but {{he had yet to}} deal with the others, who maintained their innocence. He knew that the only testimony against them would come from a nine-year-old girl, and that King James had cautioned judges to examine carefully the evidence presented against accused witches, warning against credulity. In his conclusion to the account of the trial, Potts says that it was interposed in the expected sequence [...] "by special order and commandment", presumably of the trial judges. After having convicted and sentenced to death three witches, Bromley may have been keen to avoid any suspicion of credulity by presenting his [...] "masterful exposure" [...] of the evidence presented by Grace Sowerbutts, before turning his <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the Pendle witches.|$|E
500|$|MacDonald {{indicates}} Potter {{was particularly}} {{sensitive to the}} openings and closings of her books (she insisted Benjamin Bunny end with the term [...] "rabbit-tobacco", for example), and, in the Flopsy Bunnies, the opening reflects her flair for the elevated diction sometimes encountered in her other books: [...] "It is said the effect of eating too much lettuce is 'soporific'." [...] Though the word 'soporific' is not generally encountered in literature for young children, Potter is aware of her audience's limitations and not only defines the word immediately but places it in context: [...] "I have never felt sleepy after eating lettuces; but then I am not a rabbit." [...] She not only defines the word, but introduces rabbits as her subject. The line does not draw attention to itself (though Potter is intruding herself into the narrative), but rather gives the tale a conversational tone or {{a sense of the}} story being told aloud by a narrator. Because she immediately brings the audience's <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rabbits, there is no danger she will become a character in the tale, and she is invisible through the remainder of the tale.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the peace}} treaty with Hasan, Muawiyah turned his <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Romans. In 674, Umayyad naval and army forces {{under the command of}} Muawiyah's son, Yazid ibn Muawiyah, laid siege to the Byzantine capital of Constantinople, but were {{defeated}} when the Byzantines introduced Greek fire to the naval battlefield. This siege [...] in the Chinese dynastic histories of the Old Book of Tang and New Book of Tang. They record that the large capital city of Fu lin (拂菻; i.e. the Byzantine Empire) was besieged by the Da shi (大食, i.e. Umayyad Arabs) and their commander [...] "Mo-yi" [...] (Chinese: 摩拽, Pinyin: Móyè), who Friedrich Hirth has identified as Muawiyah I. The Chinese histories then explain that the Arabs forced the Byzantines to pay tribute afterwards as part of a peace settlement.|$|E

2500|$|Most Brethren {{have always}} taught Dispensationalism as their {{theological}} system. Many of them believe that Brethren pioneer John Nelson Darby {{was the first}} in modern times to [...] "rediscover" [...] what they believe was the [...] "forgotten" [...] teaching of primitive Christianity. At any rate, Darby influenced a number of influential non-Brethren Evangelical leaders, such as D.L. Moody and, indirectly, C.I. Scofield, who popularized the theory through his Scofield Reference Bible. Essentially, Dispensationalism as taught by the Brethren sees a clear distinction between [...] "law" [...] and [...] "grace", Israel and the Church, and holds that the Church, consisting of all true Christians, will be raptured when Jesus returns. This will be followed, according to this theory, by a seven-year Great Tribulation, during which God will turn his <b>attention</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Jewish people, who will recognize Jesus as the Messiah. This period will be followed by a thousand-year Millennium, which will see Jesus return as King of Israel.|$|E

60|$|He {{put down}} his glass, and walked towards the {{staircase}} door. Again I remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall, and standing up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out. He had nothing on them but a pair of tattered, blood-stained socks. Then the door closed upon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered how he detested any fuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my mind was wool-gathering. Then, 'Remarkable Behaviour of an Eminent Scientist,' I heard the Editor say, thinking (after his wont) in headlines.

And when we see them we shall at once {{want to go to}} them--that's the way with beautiful things--and down we shall go, like flies down a wall, to Leukerbad, and so to Leuk Station, here, and then by train up the Rhone Valley and this little side valley to Stalden; and there, in the cool of the afternoon, we shall start off up a gorge, torrents and cliffs below us and above us, to sleep in a half-way inn, and go on next day to Saas Fee, Saas of the Magic, Saas of the Pagan People. And there, about Saas, are ice and snows again, and sometimes we will loiter among the rocks and trees about Saas or peep into Samuel Butler's chapels, and sometimes we will climb up {{out of the way of}} the other people on to the glaciers and snow. And, for one expedition at least, we will go up this desolate valley here to Mattmark, and so on to Monte Moro. There indeed you see Monte Rosa. Almost the best of all." ...|$|E

40|$|New {{technology}} is appearing in vehicles that increasingly {{allows them to}} “know” where they are, their relationships to other vehicles on the road, and whether a crash is imminent. At the same time, and more quickly, drivers are becoming more connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> world outside their cars through similar advances in electronic technology. The first trend promises to help drivers prevent crashes while the second raises fears of increasingly chaotic driving as drivers’ minds are elsewhere than on the driving task. Whether the promise of crash avoidance or the fear of driving chaos is realized depends on how drivers actually drive and whether the assumptions made about how they drive are correct. In fact, the US has not seen increases in crash risk as drivers’ use of electronics has increased nor are all crash avoidance systems having the expected benefits. In addition to exploring these data, the presentation will {{address some of the}} assumptions made about driving (e. g., that driving is difficult, that it requires fully conscious attention, that drivers will respond to information about their vehicles, and others) and whether those assumptions appear <b>to</b> fit <b>the</b> data on crash avoidance and distracted driving.
