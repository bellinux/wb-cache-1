5|$|In a study {{published}} in 1979 in Advances in the Study of Affect, vol. 5, and in another article using the same data and published in 1980 in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Michael D. Storms of the University of Kansas outlined his own reimagining of the Kinsey scale. Whereas Kinsey measured sexual orientation based on a combination of actual sexual behavior and fantasizing and eroticism, Storms used only fantasizing and eroticism. Storms, however, placed hetero-eroticism and homo-eroticism on separate axes rather than at two ends of a single scale; this allows for a distinction between bisexuality (exhibiting both hetero- and homo-eroticism in degrees comparable to hetero- or homosexuals, respectively) and asexuality (exhibiting a level of homo-eroticism comparable to <b>a</b> <b>heterosexual</b> and a level of hetero-eroticism comparable to a homosexual, namely, little to none). This type of scale accounted for asexuality for the first time. Storms conjectured that many researchers following Kinsey's model could be mis-categorizing asexual subjects as bisexual, because both were simply defined by a lack of preference for gender in sexual partners.|$|E

Horrified, Lois changes her mind on same-sex marriage, deciding that gay couples who love each other {{have the right to be}} together. She returns to Quahog to convince Brian to free the mayor, saying that if he pursues this any further, he will be hurting his own cause. Brian agrees, and ends the hostage situation. Since it has distracted the town from the Dig 'Em scandal, Mayor West agrees to drop the ban on gay marriage. Brian gives him a key for a Volkswagen Scirocco, and West drops the hostage charges. Jasper and Ricardo get married in the backyard of the Griffin house.|$|E

5|$|Shaw wrote The Christening, {{his only}} novel, in 1975. It centres around Miles Madgwick, who {{believes}} that he is bisexual but is too timid to find out through physical intercourse, so he instead describes his most intimate thoughts in his diary. He then meets a married woman named Alice and her son, Rodney; he comes to identify with Rodney's childhood innocence, and in Alice sees a symbol both {{of his mother and}} <b>a</b> <b>heterosexual</b> lover. Alice starts to tire of her husband and grow fonder of Madgwick, who experiences mixed emotions in his continued interactions with her and Rodney. One night, Rodney stays overnight at Madgwick's house and, when he takes the boy home in a taxicab, the driver observes their strange behaviour and accuses Madgwick of being a pederast. When Alice asks Madgwick to become the godfather to her new child, the driver threatens to expose Madgwick, creating a conflict between losing his first feelings of intimacy with others or facing humiliation and ridicule at the driver's exposure.|$|E
5|$|Spanish bishops {{also claimed}} that the Government, by {{extending}} the right of marriage to same-sex couples, weakened the meaning of marriage, which they defined as an involving <b>a</b> <b>heterosexual</b> couple. The Spanish Family Forum expressed concern over the possibility of same-sex couples adopting and raising children, and argued that adoption is not a right for the parents, but for the adopted. Gay associations replied that de facto adoption by same-sex couples had existed {{for a long time}} in Spain, since many couples were rearing minors adopted by one of the partners. Adoption by same-sex couples was already legal in Navarre (2000), the Basque Country (2003), Aragon (2004), Catalonia (2005) and Cantabria (2005) before the same-sex marriage law legalized these adoptions nationwide. Furthermore, in Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002) and Extremadura (2003), same-sex couples could jointly begin procedures to temporarily or permanently take children in care. These associations also argued that there was no scientific basis for the claim that the parents' sexual orientation would cause developmental problems for their adopted children. This view is officially supported by the Spanish School of Psychology, which also states that homosexuality is not a pathology.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} study is to generate <b>a</b> theory of <b>heterosexual</b> identity development derived from the lived experiences of heterosexuals who are allies of the lesbian, gay, and bisexual community. The literature on sexual orientation and racial identity development is reviewed and the emerging theories on heterosexual identity development are presented. Using data collected from interviews with self-identified heterosexual persons who define themselves as allies of sexual minority community, grounded theory methodology is used to generate <b>a</b> theory of <b>heterosexual</b> identity development. Eight of the nine {{participants in this study}} demonstrated what the literature describes as <b>an</b> integrated <b>heterosexual</b> identity. The participants described a path of development that involved both individual and social processes. These eight participants felt motivated to develop and maintain their sexual orientation identity because it fit with their personal values and their social reference group 2 ̆ 7 s values about social justice and equality. The participants also demonstrated <b>a</b> multifaceted <b>heterosexual</b> identity development process that incorporated a variety of biopsychosocial influences and personal values. Directions for future research on heterosexual identity development are suggested...|$|R

25|$|Psychiatrist Anil Aggrawal {{explains}} why the terms are useful in a glossary: Androphilia – The romantic and/or sexual attraction to adult males. The term, along with gynephilia, is needed to overcome immense difficulties in characterizing the sexual orientation of transmen and transwomen. For instance, {{it is difficult to}} decide whether a transman erotically attracted to males is <b>a</b> <b>heterosexual</b> female or a homosexual male; or a transwoman erotically attracted to females is <b>a</b> <b>heterosexual</b> male or a lesbian female. Any attempt to classify them may not only cause confusion but arouse offense among the affected subjects. In such cases, while defining sexual attraction, it is best to focus on the object of their attraction rather than on the sex or gender of the subject.|$|E
