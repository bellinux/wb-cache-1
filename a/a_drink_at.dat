5|$|The set {{has been}} celebrated by the Monopoly pub crawl, which {{attempts}} to visit all the locations {{on the board}} and have <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> <b>at</b> a pub in each one. The relative wealth of the various places has changed slightly. Whitechapel Road is now the cheapest (as opposed to Old Kent Road) but Mayfair remains the most expensive; in 2016 an estimate by loan provider West One showed the average house price on each was £590,000 and £3,150,000 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Whitney {{believes}} she is pregnant, {{and when she}} tells Tyler, he seems reluctant {{to take on a}} child. However he comes round to the idea, but Whitney discovers she is not pregnant after all. Bianca is caught stealing money and returns to prison, but this time located in Suffolk. The rest of Whitney's family move to Suffolk to be near her, but Whitney stays and looks after the house, along with Bianca's uncle Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman). Soon after, Tyler moves in. Whitney is angry when Joey Branning (David Witts) kisses her. Several months later, after Bianca {{and the rest of the}} family move back, Whitney and Tyler plan to get their own home. Whitney tells Tyler about the kiss with Joey, so he breaks up with her. However, he regrets it and proposes to Whitney; she accepts. Bianca disapproves when she finds out. When Lauren kisses Tyler to make her ex-boyfriend Joey jealous, Whitney ends her friendship with Lauren. After several weeks Lauren and Whitney make up.

Nocioni's {{physical}} style of defense created controversy around the league, and he was suspended for one game after a hard foul to Detroit Pistons' Tayshaun Prince. Nocioni had previously committed a hard foul on the Miami Heat's Dwyane Wade and then was shoved past photographers and into the first row of spectators by Udonis Haslem. A spectator tossed <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> <b>at</b> Nocioni, which {{was similar to the}} incident that triggered Pacers–Pistons brawl at The Palace of Auburn Hills. The fan was ejected by security. For the incident, Nocioni received a flagrant-one foul (which is a foul involving excessive or unjustified contact) and a technical. Haslem received a technical and an ejection.|$|E

McLagan commented that Moon [...] "couldn't handle it." [...] Moon would harass them with phone calls, and on one occasion before Kim sued for divorce, he invited McLagan for <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> <b>at</b> a Richmond pub and sent several [...] "heavies" [...] to break into McLagan's home on Fife Road and look for Kim, forcing her to hide in a walk-in closet. She died in a car accident in Austin, Texas on 2 August 2006.|$|E
500|$|Sévérine greets Bond on {{his arrival}} at the casino. They share <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> <b>at</b> the bar and discuss the {{subjects}} of death and fear. Bond presses her {{for more information about}} her boss Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem) to which she responds fearfully and cautions him not to look for further information. Identifying her wrist tattoo as the mark of the Macau sex trade, Bond deduces that she was once a sex slave and was taken in by Silva to work as his representative under the guise of being [...] "rescued". Promising to help her escape from Silva and to kill him, Bond asks for Sévérine to arrange a meeting with her boss. Sévérine trusts him and warns him about her guards' intentions to assassinate him by throwing him into a pit with komodo dragons. She tells Bond that if he survives, he can find her on her yacht, the Chimera.|$|E

500|$|In July 1957, Monk {{began to}} perform at the venue for six months with saxophonist John Coltrane, bassist Ahmed Abdul-Malik, and drummer Shadow Wilson in his group. However, by the time Monk's {{employment}} there ended in December, he had lost Wilson to poor health, while Coltrane left {{in pursuit of a}} solo career and a return to Miles Davis's group. After returning to New York City's club scene with a new quartet, Monk received an eight-week offer from Joe and Iggy Termini to play the Five Spot Café beginning on June 12, 1958. He played most nights during the weekend to capacity crowds with Abdul-Malik, drummer Roy Haynes, and tenor saxophonist Johnny Griffin, who had performed with Monk before. Griffin was unfamiliar with all of his repertoire and, like Coltrane, found it difficult to solo over Monk's comping during their first few weeks: [...] "Any deviation, one note off, and you sound like you're playing another tune, and you're not paying attention to what's going on. And it's so evident ... there's no space." [...] During their performances, Monk often left the stage for <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> <b>at</b> the bar or danced around, which gave Griffin an opportunity to play with more space. However, the quartet eventually developed a sufficient rapport and grasp of the set list.|$|E
500|$|A {{turning point}} came on 2 November. Air {{pollution}} in New York had risen significantly and exacerbated chest illnesses such as Thomas had. By {{the end of}} the month over 200 New Yorkers had died from the smog. On 3 November, Thomas spent most of the day in bed drinking. He went out in the evening to keep two drink appointments. After returning to the hotel he went out again for <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> <b>at</b> 2am. After drinking at the White Horse, a pub he had found through Scottish poet Ruthven Todd, Thomas returned to the Hotel Chelsea, declaring, [...] "I've had 18 straight whiskies. I think that's the record!" [...] The barman, and the owner of the pub who served him, later commented that Thomas could not have imbibed more than half that amount. Thomas had an appointment at a clam house in New Jersey with Todd on 4 November. When phoned at the Chelsea that morning, he said he was feeling ill and postponed the engagement. Later he went drinking with Reitell at the White Horse and, feeling sick again, returned to the hotel. Feltenstein came to see him three times that day, administering the steroid ACTH by injection and, on his third visit, half a grain (32.4 milligrams) of morphine sulphate, which affected his breathing. Reitell became increasingly concerned and telephoned Feltenstein for advice. He suggested she get male assistance, so she called upon the painter Jack Heliker, who arrived before 11pm. At midnight on 5 November Thomas's breathing became more difficult and his face turned blue. An ambulance was summoned.|$|E

2500|$|The {{testimony}} from American writer Eugene Bagger is quite unfavorable regarding {{the efficiency of}} the [...] "assembly line" [...] set up by Sousa Mendes. Bagger says that on the 18th he queued [...] for a couple of hours, at the Portuguese Consulate hoping to get a visa. Bagger says that the pushing and the elbowing drove him to despair and he gave up after a few hours. The next morning he joined again a mob of four hundred in front of the Portuguese Consulate. He waited in line from 9 a.m. till 11 o’clock, again to no avail and he finally quit. He then decided to have <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> <b>at</b> Hotel Splendid where he found Sousa Mendes having an aperitif with a friend. Sousa Mendes told Bagger that he was tired from overworking the previous day, from the crowds and from the heat. Then, at Bagger’s request, Sousa Mendes signed Bagger’s passport and told him {{to go back to the}} consulate to have it stamped. To Bagger’s surprise he was then helped by M. Skalski the Polish consul at Arcachon. At the Consulate M. Skalski was able to cut through the crowds and get Bagger’s passports duly stamped.|$|E

2500|$|Second, Searle {{believes}} we can rationally {{do things}} that don't result from our own desires. It is widely believed that one cannot derive an [...] "ought" [...] from an [...] "is", i.e. that facts about how the world is can never {{tell you what you}} should do ('Hume's Law'). By contrast, in so far as a fact is understood as relating to an institution (marriage, promises, commitments, etc.), which is to be understood as a system of constitutive rules, then what one should do can be understood as following from the institutional fact of what one has done; institutional fact, then, can be understood as opposed to the [...] "brute facts" [...] related to Hume's Law. For example, Searle believes the fact that you promised to do something means you should do it, because by making the promise you are participating in the constitutive rules that arrange the system of promise making itself, and therefore understand a [...] "shouldness" [...] as implicit in the mere factual action of promising. Furthermore, he believes that this provides a desire-independent reason for an action—if you order <b>a</b> <b>drink</b> <b>at</b> a bar, you should pay for it even if you have no desire to. This argument, which he first made in his paper, [...] "How to Derive 'Ought' from 'Is'" [...] (1964), remains highly controversial, but even three decades later Searle continued to defend his view that [...] "..the traditional metaphysical distinction between fact and value cannot be captured by the linguistic distinction between 'evaluative' and 'descriptive' because all such speech act notions are already normative." ...|$|E
