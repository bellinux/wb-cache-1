5|$|Vikings {{returned}} again <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 860s {{and secured}} loot or ransom, but, in {{a turning point}} for the history of France, the city's walls held against the Vikings' greatest attacking force in the Siege of Paris (885–86).|$|E
5|$|After {{recovering}} surprisingly fast {{from the}} sack of Rome, the Romans immediately resumed their expansion within Italy. The First Samnite War from 343 BC to 341 BC was relatively short: the Romans defeated the Samnites in two battles, but {{were forced to}} withdraw before they could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their Latin allies in the Latin War. Rome defeated the Latins in the Battle of Vesuvius <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Trifanum, after which the Latin cities were obliged to submit to Roman rule.|$|E

For the country's 25th anniversary of independence, on 30 October 2006, Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, opened Antigua and Barbuda's new parliament building, reading a message from his mother, the Queen. HRH The Duke of York visited Antigua and Barbuda in January 2001.|$|E
5|$|Following {{an initial}} {{decline in the}} {{population}} {{at the turn of}} the 20th century, more houses were constructed between the Great War and the Second World War <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s and 1960s, adding to the cluster of cottages from the 19th century and earlier.|$|E
5|$|Historically {{a part of}} Lancashire, {{there are}} records of Didsbury {{existing}} as a small hamlet {{as early as the}} 13th century. Its early history was dominated by being part of the Manor of Withington, a feudal estate that covered a large part of what is now the south of Manchester. Didsbury was described during the 18th century as a township separate from outside influence. In 1745 Charles Edward Stuart crossed the Mersey at Didsbury in the Jacobite march south from Manchester to Derby, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subsequent retreat.|$|E

5|$|O'Gara {{made his}} Munster debut {{alongside}} longtime Munster and Ireland teammate David Wallace against Connacht in August 1997, scoring 19 points. O'Gara's Heineken Cup debut came against Harlequins in September 1997 in the 1997–98 Heineken Cup. O'Gara kicked 15 points, but Munster lost the game 48-40. He started for Munster in the 2000 Heineken Cup Final, which Northampton Saints won 8–9, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2002 Heineken Cup Final, which Leicester Tigers won 15–9.|$|E
5|$|Rome was {{therefore}} forced to contend by around 340 BC against both Samnite incursions into their territory and, simultaneously, {{in a bitter}} war against their former allies. Rome bested the Latins in the Battle of Vesuvius <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Trifanum, after which the Latin cities were obliged to submit to Roman rule. Perhaps due to Rome's lenient treatment of their defeated foe, the Latins submitted largely amicably to Roman rule for the next 200 years.|$|E
5|$|Shivayogi's other {{writings}} {{include a}} scientific encyclopaedia called Vivekachintamani, so well regarded {{that it was}} translated into Marathi language in 1604 and Sanskrit language in 1652 <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 18th century. The writing categorises 1,500 topics based on subject and covers a wide array such as poetics, dance and drama, musicology and erotics. His translation of the Shiva Yoga Pradipika from Sanskrit was done to elucidate the Shaiva philosophy and benefit those ignorant of the original language.|$|E

American hurdler Clement placed first in the heat (48.27seconds), while fellow Jamaican Markino Buckley placed third (48.50seconds). Overall, of the semifinal round of sixteen athletes, McFarlane finished in fourth place <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> finals on August 17.

5|$|The BBC has dramatised some of Hornung's Raffles {{stories for}} radio, {{first in the}} 1940s <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990s, when Nigel Havers played Raffles. In 1977 Anthony Valentine played the thief, and Christopher Strauli his partner, in a Yorkshire Television series. A 2001 TV version, The Gentleman Thief, adapted the stories for a {{contemporary}} audience, with Havers playing the lead.|$|E
5|$|The White House, {{originally}} {{dating back}} to 1750, is timber framed and was extended in 1830 <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960s. The exterior is covered in hung slates, which caused extensive damage to the original frame which required extensive repairs in 1994. The 1797 chimneys are pointed in shape, to stop birds nesting and draw smoke up from the fire. The lawn {{in front of the}} building was the house's original turning circle, with the road once being a thoroughfare from Chingford to Waltham Abbey.|$|E

5|$|The {{superficial}} rock of Orkney {{is almost}} entirely Old Red Sandstone, mostly of Middle Devonian age. As in the neighbouring mainland county of Caithness, this sandstone rests upon the metamorphic rocks of the Moine series, as may {{be seen on the}} Mainland, where a narrow strip is exposed between Stromness and Inganess, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> small island of Graemsay; they are represented by grey gneiss and granite.|$|E
5|$|This {{fountain}} was relocated {{a number}} of times throughout its history: first in 1874 when the building near which it was built was demolished to build Palazzo Ferreria, in the 1960s when the City Gate was rebuilt, in 2000 when Saint James Cavalier was renovated and converted into a cultural centre, <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 2010s during the City Gate Project. Due to these relocations and renovations, nothing remains of the original fountain.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{points out}} that all changes of form are {{phenomena}} of growth. He analyses growth curves for man, noting rapid growth before birth <b>and</b> <b>again</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> teens; and then curves for other animals. In plants, growth is often in pulses, as in Spirogyra, peaks at a specific temperature, and below that value roughly doubles every 10 degrees Celsius. Tree growth varies cyclically with season (less strongly in evergreens), preserving a record of historic climates. Tadpole tails regenerate rapidly at first, slowing exponentially.|$|E
