25|$|The <b>Advanced</b> <b>Format</b> {{is used in}} all sanctioned tournaments (with the {{exception}} of certain Pegasus League formats). This format follows all the normal rules of the game, but also places a complete ban on certain cards that are deemed too powerful for tournament play. These cards are on a special list called the Forbidden, or Banned List. There are also certain cards that are Limited or Semi-Limited to only being allowed 1 or 2 of those cards in a deck and side deck combined, respectively. This list is updated every three months (January 1, April 1) and is followed in all tournaments that use this format.|$|E

40|$|The future optical {{switched}} wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) networks {{will require}} all optical wavelength conversion to avoid contention in a node when two signals {{on the same}} wavelength are being switched to the same output fiber. These future networks will also employ <b>advanced</b> modulation <b>formats</b> {{in order to increase}} the capacity of optical networks. In order to perform wavelength conversion operations on <b>advanced</b> modulation <b>formats,</b> a coherent nonlinear process, such as four-wave mixing (FWM), is required to preserve the amplitude and phase information. The phase noise transfer problem has crucial significance for the exploitation of FWM-based wavelength converters for <b>advanced</b> modulation <b>formats</b> because the phase noise transfer degrades the overall system performance. In this work, the required optical signal to noise ratio (OSNR) and laser phase noise (linewidth) limits are calculated via Monte Carlo simulations for the wavelength conversion of <b>advanced</b> modulation <b>formats</b> including DQPSK and M-QAM. Due to the sensitivity of M-QAM signals with respect to phase noise, the conversion performance is investigated using two different decision-directed phase-locked loop carrier phase recovery algorithms. In order to develop a validated numerical model for all-optical wavelength conversion of <b>advanced</b> modulation <b>formats,</b> the required OSNR versus pump linewidth at two values of bit error rate (BER) of 10 - 3 and 10 - 4 for DQPSK, 16 -QAM and 64 -QAM are reported for degenerate and non-degenerate FWM. With these calculations, the performance of wavelength conversion of <b>advanced</b> modulation <b>formats</b> will be guaranteed by selecting lasers with linewidths below these linewidth limits. As a next step of this work, All-optical wavelength conversion of Nyquist-WDM Superchannel using FWM in an SOA based on <b>advanced</b> modulation <b>formats</b> such as DQPSK, 16 and 64 - QAM are demonstrated...|$|R

50|$|Many host {{computer}} {{hardware and software}} components assume the hard drive is configured around 512-byte sector boundaries. This includes {{a broad range of}} items including chipsets, operating systems, database engines, hard drive partitioning and imaging tools, backup and file system utilities as well as a small fraction of other software applications. In order to maintain compatibility with legacy computing components, many hard disk drive suppliers support <b>Advanced</b> <b>Format</b> technologies on the recording media coupled with 512-byte conversion firmware. Hard drives configured with 4096-byte physical sectors with 512-byte firmware are referred to as <b>Advanced</b> <b>Format</b> 512e, or 512 emulation drives.|$|E
50|$|The {{translation}} of the 4096-byte physical format to a virtual 512-byte increment is transparent to the entity accessing the hard disk drive. Read and write commands are issued to <b>Advanced</b> <b>Format</b> drives in the same format as legacy drives. However, during the read process, the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Format</b> hard drive loads the entire 4096-byte sector containing the requested 512-byte data into memory located on the drive. The emulation firmware extracts and re-formats the specific data into a 512-byte chunk before sending the data to the host. The entire process typically occurs {{with little or no}} degradation in performance.|$|E

50|$|<b>Advanced</b> <b>Format</b> {{was coined}} to cover what was {{expected}} to become several generations of long-data-sector technologies, and its logo was created to distinguish long-data-sector-based hard disk drives from those using legacy 512-, 520- or 528-byte sectors.|$|E
50|$|When using <b>Advanced</b> <b>Format</b> drives with legacy {{operating}} systems, it {{is important}} to realign the disk drive using software provided by the hard disk manufacturer. Disk realignment is necessary to avoid a performance degrading condition known as cluster straddling where a shifted partition causes filesystem clusters to span partial physical disk sectors. Since cluster-to-sector alignment is determined when creating hard drive partitions, the realignment software is used after partitioning the disk. This can help reduce the number of unaligned writes generated by the computing ecosystem. Further activities to make applications ready for the transition to <b>Advanced</b> <b>Format</b> technologies are being spearheaded by the Long Data Sector Committee and the hard disk drive manufacturers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Advanced</b> <b>Format</b> is also {{considered}} a milestone {{technology in the}} history of HDD storage, where data has been generally processed in 512-byte segments since at least the introduction of consumer-grade HDDs in the early 1980s, and in similar or smaller chunks in the professional field since the HDD's invention in 1956.|$|E

We employ advanced spectral domain filtering techniques and carrier pulse reshaping. We then apply these optimisation methods to investigate spectral and temporal domain characteristics of <b>advanced</b> modulation <b>formats</b> in fibre optic telecommunication systems. Next we investigate numerical methods used in detecting and measuring the system performance of <b>advanced</b> modulation <b>formats.</b> We then numerically study the combination of return-to-zero differential phase-shift keying (RZ-DPSK) with advanced photonic devices. Finally we analyse the dispersion management of Nx 40 Gbit/s RZ-DPSK transmission applied to a commercial terrestrial lightwave system. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
