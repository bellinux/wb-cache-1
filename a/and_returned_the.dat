5|$|NC State {{received}} Tech's post-touchdown kickoff <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>the</b> ball {{to their}} 32-yard line. The Wolfpack offense {{had time for}} just one play—an eight-yard pass—before {{the end of the}} quarter. With one quarter remaining in the game, NC State still held a 2116 lead.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the game, the Hokies struggled on offense and were held scoreless until well into the second quarter. Kansas, however, was able to get on the board several times, jumping to a 17–0 lead before Virginia Tech scored its first points. Kansas's broke the game open in the first quarter after All-American cornerback Aqib Talib intercepted a pass by backup Virginia Tech quarterback Tyrod Taylor <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>the</b> ball 60yards for the game's opening points.|$|E
5|$|He {{participated in}} many of the major {{conflicts}} of the 18th century, including the War of the Polish Succession, the War of the Austrian Succession, the Seven Years' War and the Anglo-Spanish War. His most famous achievement was the successful invasion of Minorca in 1781, in which he defeated a British garrison <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>the</b> island to Spain, although his efforts the following year to recapture Gibraltar from the British were a notable failure. He ended his career {{in the service of the}} Spanish Bourbon monarchy, which had been allied with France prior to the French Revolution, and died in Madrid.|$|E

5|$|In 1888, after {{spending}} sixteen years cataloging Newton's papers, Cambridge University kept {{a small number}} <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>the</b> rest to the Earl of Portsmouth. In 1936, a descendant offered the papers for sale at Sotheby's. The collection was broken up and sold {{for a total of}} about £9,000. John Maynard Keynes was one of about three dozen bidders who obtained part of the collection at auction. Keynes went on to reassemble an estimated half of Newton's collection of papers on alchemy before donating his collection to Cambridge University in 1946.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Daniels {{continued}} {{his effort to}} reduce state operating costs by signing into law a bill privatizing the enrollment service for the state's welfare programs. Indiana's welfare enrollment facilities were replaced with call centers operated by IBM. In mid-2009, after complaints of poor service, Daniels canceled the contract <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>the</b> enrollment service to the public sector.|$|E
5|$|In March 2010, Blue Demon, Jr., the {{president}} of NWA Mexico, sent letters to CMLL, telling them to stop promoting the NWA-branded championships since they {{were not part of}} the NWA. NWA Mexico had previously tried to reclaim the three NWA-branded championships promoted by CMLL, but was ignored by CMLL. The promotion did not directly respond to the latest claim either; the NWA Welterweight Champion, Mephisto, commented, simply stating that the titles belonged to CMLL. Finally, on August 12, 2010, CMLL debuted the new NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Championship <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>the</b> old title to NWA.|$|E

5|$|The pier {{was sold}} to the Noble Organisation in 1984. The theatre was removed two years later, on the {{understanding}} {{that it would be}} replaced; however a domed amusement arcade was put in place instead. Consequently, the seaward end of the pier was filled with fairground rides, including thrill rides, children's rides and roller coasters. Entertainment continued to be popular at the pier; the Spice Girls made an early live performance there in 1996 <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>the</b> following year after achieving commercial success.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days before}} the Armistice, Tech beat NC State 128–0. State's only {{highlight}} came in the third quarter, when John Ripple recovered a teammate's fumble <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>the</b> ball 75 yards for a touchdown. However, it was called back due to an offsides penalty. Walter Camp attended the game. Ripple became the first football player from North Carolina ever to make an All-America team when he was selected second-team All-American by Camp. Five minutes into the fourth quarter, the game was called. The scoring breakdown: Barron and Ferst got 4 touchdowns each, Smith 3, Allen 3, Staton 2, Cobb 2, and Adams 1.|$|E
5|$|A Tony Romo {{touchdown}} {{pass in the}} third quarter gave the Cowboys their first lead of the game. The lead was extended when Nick Folk converted his second field goal of the day, putting the Cowboys up 13–3 as the game entered the final quarter. Reed converted his second field goal of the game, bringing the Steelers within seven points with 7:20 remaining in regulation. On the Steelers next drive, Ben Roethelisberger threw a {{touchdown pass}} to Heath Miller—tying the game with 2:04 remaining. Deshea Townsend intercepted Romo's next pass <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>the</b> ball 25yards, scoring a touchdown to give the Steelers a seven-point lead, which they held {{to the end of the}} game.|$|E

5|$|A legend narrates {{that the}} {{sacrificial}} cow Kamadhenu resided with sage Jamadagni. The earliest {{version of the}} legend, which appears in the epic Mahabharata, narrates that the thousand-armed Haihaya king, Kartavirya Arjuna, destroyed Jamadagni's hermitage and captured the calf of Kamadhenu. To retrieve the calf, Jamadagni's son Parashurama slew the king, whose sons in turn killed Jamadagni. Parashurama then destroyed the kshatriya ("warrior") race 21 times and his father is resurrected by divine grace. Similar accounts of the abduction of the celestial cow or her calf, the killing of Jamadagni by Kartavirya Arjuna, and the revenge of Parashurama resulting {{in the death of}} Kartavirya Arjuna, exist in other texts. The Bhagavata Purana mentions that the king abducted Kamadhenu as well as her calf and Parashurama defeated the king <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>the</b> kine to his father. The Padma Purana mentions that when Kartavirya Arjuna tried to capture her, Kamadhenu, by her own power, defeated him and his army and flew off to heaven; the enraged king then killed Jamadagni.|$|E
5|$|Around 1350BC, the {{stability}} of the New Kingdom seemed threatened further when Amenhotep IV ascended the throne and instituted a series of radical and chaotic reforms. Changing his name to Akhenaten, he touted the previously obscure sun deity Aten as the supreme deity, suppressed the worship of most other deities, and attacked the power of the temple that had become dominated by the priests of Amun in Thebes, whom he saw as corrupt. Moving the capital to the new city of Akhetaten (modern-day Amarna), Akhenaten turned a deaf ear to events in the Near East (where the Hittites, Mitanni, and Assyrians were vying for control). He was devoted to his new religion and artistic style. After his death, the cult of the Aten was quickly abandoned, the priests of Amun soon regained power <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>the</b> capital to Thebes. Under their influence the subsequent pharaohs Tutankhamun, Ay, Horemheb, and possibly even Neferneferuaten/Nefertiti herself worked to erase all mention of Akhenaten's heresy, now known as the Amarna Period.|$|E
5|$|Astronomical data {{taken with}} CCDs must undergo several {{calibration}} steps {{before they are}} suitable for astronomical analysis. STScI has developed sophisticated software that automatically calibrates data when they are requested from the archive using the best calibration files available. This 'on-the-fly' processing means that large data requests can take a day or more to be processed <b>and</b> <b>returned.</b> <b>The</b> process by which data is calibrated automatically is known as 'pipeline reduction', and is increasingly common at major observatories. Astronomers may if they wish retrieve the calibration files themselves and run the pipeline reduction software locally. This may be desirable when calibration files other than those selected automatically need to be used.|$|E

5|$|Buffalo {{received}} the ball first {{to begin the}} game, <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>the</b> opening kickoff to their own 24-yard line. They were unable to move the ball in threeplays, and punted the ball to Connecticut. The Huskies took possession on their own 18-yard line and drove down the field with alternating rushes by running back Donald Brown and quarterback Tyler Lorenzen, earning two first downs. On 2nddownand5 from the UConn 49-yard line, Lorenzen was sacked by Buffalo's Sherrod Lott and fumbled; the ball was recovered by UConn right tackle Mike Hicks, allowing the Huskies to retain possession. A holding penalty on the next play called on UConn left tackle William Beatty set up 3rd-and-24. Donald Brown rushed for fifteenyards {{but was unable to}} reach the first-down marker, forcing UConn to punt.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} from December 5 to December 6, Petras Vileišis printed 36,000 {{copies of the}} {{resolution}} for distribution. After the assembly, notorious for its loud, lengthy and intense debates, the delegates returned to their communities and started {{to carry out its}} resolutions. The old Russian administrations were replaced in 125 out of the 280 volosts (82 in Kaunas, 33 in Suvalkai, and 10 in Vilnius Governorates). These communities elected their own representatives, organized their own schools where classes were taught in the Lithuanian language, and stopped paying taxes. While the first Russian responses were disorganized and confused, the authorities soon marshaled their armed forces <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>the</b> situation back to normal. The process was relatively peaceful; {{there were only a few}} clashes between armed groups of peasants and Tsarist military forces. Unlike in neighboring Latvia or Estonia, peasants did not rise against their landlords. A number of the most prominent activists of this movement were arrested and sent to Siberia.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> <b>the</b> opening kickoff to its 19-yard line. In his opening drive, Seminoles quarterback Drew Weatherford completed several long passes, including a long 37-yard strike from his own 48-yard line to drive the Seminoles' offense inside the Virginia Tech red zone. Once there, however, the Florida State offense began to struggle with the Virginia Tech defense, which had recovered somewhat from the initial shock of Weatherford's offensive success. On the three plays that followed Weatherford's 37-yard pass, Florida State managed only six positive yards, but this total was largely negated by a five-yard false start penalty that pushed FSU's offense backward. Facing a fourth down, Florida State coach Bobby Bowden sent in kicker Gary Cismesia to attempt a 31-yard field goal. The kick was successful, and the three points gave Florida State an early 30 lead with 11:06 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
