25|$|The {{property}} may be reassessed {{under certain}} conditions other than a change of ownership, such as when additions or new construction occur. The assessed value is also subject to reduction if {{the market value of}} the property declines below its assessed value, for example, during a real estate slump. Reductions of property valuation were not provided for by Proposition 13 itself, but were made possible by the passage of Proposition 8 (SCA No. 67) during 1978 that amended Proposition 13. Such a real estate slump and downward reassessments occurred during 2009 when the California State Board of Equalization announced an estimated reduction of property tax base year values due to negative inflation.

40|$|The <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> versus unit <b>taxes</b> {{debate has}} {{traditionally}} emphasized tax yield. For this criterion, <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> <b>taxes</b> outperform unit taxes {{in terms of}} welfare {{for a wide range}} of imperfect competition settings, including Dixit-Stiglitz monopolistic competition. Yet, in a number of policy fields, such as environmental, health or trade economics, policy makers apply taxes to target the production/consumption volume in an industry, i. e. aim at a certain corrective effect rather than tax yield. This paper compares the two tax instruments with respect to equal corrective-effect in a Dixit-Stiglitz setting with love of variety, entry, exit, and redistribution of tax revenues.

2500|$|The {{establishment}} of the defense housing program accelerated quickly {{after the passage of}} National Housing for Defense Act of 1940 (also known as the Lanham Act) by Congress on October 14, 1940, which provided $140,000,000 for defense housing construction. The Lanham Act specified that, [...] "The housing is to be wherever feasible of a permanent nature, and after the emergency has passed these homes are to be disposed of, and in that way the Government is to recoup the initial investment... and they will be available for permanent homes." [...] The cost per unit was set at, and not permitted to exceed, $3000. By its very nature, defense housing was primarily constructed for the middle-income employees of the defense industry. [...] The Act also empowered the Federal Works Agency (FWA) to overrule local governmental resistance and regulations in order to expedite construction. Additionally, it ensured that the host communities of defense housing projects would receive payments from the federal government, in lieu of taxes [...] "equivalent to full <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> <b>tax,</b> less the cost of any municipal services provided by the project". During the war years the Lanham Act was regularly amended by Congress in order to provide additional funds for housing and to adjust various aspects of the Act, especially its impact on local communities. By 1945, almost 9,000,000 individuals had been provided with housing. Total costs approached $7.5 billion ($5.2 billion private financing and $2.3 billion public financing), with the average unit costing $4,566.00.|$|E

40|$|Abstract] This note {{calls into}} {{question}} the canon of the equivalence between specific and <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> taxation in competitive markets. We conduct our analysis under the plausible assumption that a competitive firm knows the relevant prices it faces, but the tax authorities may not be well informed about all the prices of hundreds or even thousands of competitive firms. It is shown in competitive markets that, to collect a fixed amount of revenue for the government, <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> <b>taxes</b> entail a higher level of consumer surplus than specific taxes. The key to our finding lies in that evading specific taxes must be via underreporting quantities sold, whereas evading <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> <b>taxes</b> can be via underreporting selling prices as well as quantities sold...|$|R
40|$|Blackorby and Murty [2007] prove that, with a {{monopoly}} and under {{one hundred percent}} profit taxation and uniform lump-sum transfers, the utility possibility sets of economies with unit and <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> <b>taxes</b> are identical. This welfare-equivalence {{is in contrast to}} most previous studies. In this paper, we relax the assumption of one hundred percent profit taxation and allow the consumers to receive profit incomes from ownership of shares in the monopoly firm. We find that, for any fixed vector of profit shares, the utility possibility sets of economies with unit and <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> <b>taxes</b> are not generally identical. But it does not imply that one completely dominates the other. Rather, the two utility possibility frontiers cross each other...|$|R
60|$|It {{remains to}} speak of the effect on rent. Assuming (what is usually the fact) that the {{consumption}} of food is not diminished, the same cultivation as before will be necessary to supply the wants of the community; the margin of cultivation, to use Dr. Chalmers’s expression, remains where it was; and the same land or capital, which, as the least productive, already regulated the value and price of the whole produce, will continue to regulate them. The effect which a tax on agricultural produce will have on rent depends on its affecting or not affecting the difference between the return to this least productive land or capital and the returns to other lands and capitals. Now, this depends on {{the manner in which the}} tax is imposed. If it is an <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> <b>tax,</b> or, what is the same thing, a fixed proportion of the produce, such as tithe for example, it evidently lowers corn-rents. For it takes more corn from the better lands than from the worse, and exactly in the degree in which they are better, land of twice the productiveness paying twice as much to the tithe. Whatever takes more from the greater of two quantities than from the less, diminishes the difference between them. The imposition of a tithe on corn would take a tithe also from corn-rent: for, if we reduce a series of numbers by a tenth each, the differences between them are reduced one tenth.|$|E

As modeled here, oligopolists with different efficiencies determine the size distribution of firms.
