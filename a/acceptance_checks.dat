40|$|The {{objectives}} are {{to investigate the}} fundamental reasons which cause independently developed software programs to fail dependently, and to examine fault tolerant software structures which maximize reliability gain {{in the presence of}} such dependent failure behavior. The authors used 20 redundant programs from a software reliability experiment to analyze the software errors causing coincident failures, to compare the reliability of N-version and recovery block structures composed of these programs, and to examine the impact of diversity on software reliability using subpopulations of these programs. The results indicate that both conceptually related and unrelated errors can cause coincident failures and that recovery block structures offer more reliability gain than N-version structures if <b>acceptance</b> <b>checks</b> that fail independently from the software components are available.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experimental investigation is to compare the functional performance and software reliability of competing fault tolerant software structures utilizing software diversity. In this experiment, three versions of the redundancy management software for a skewed sensor array have been developed using three diverse failure detection and isolation algorithms and incorporated into various N-version, recovery block and hybrid software structures. The empirical results show that, for maximum functional performance improvement in the selected application domain, the results of diverse algorithms should be voted before being processed by multiple versions without enforced diversity. Results also suggest that when the reliability gain with an N-version structure is modest, recovery block structures are more feasible since higher reliability can be obtained using an <b>acceptance</b> <b>check</b> with a modest reliability...|$|R

40|$|Ultrasound {{diagnosis}} is routinely used in {{obstetrics and gynecology}} for fetal biometry, and owing to its time-consuming process, {{there has been a}} great demand for automatic estimation. However, the automated analysis of ultrasound images is complicated because they are patient-specific, operator-dependent, and machine-specific. Among various types of fetal biometry, the accurate estimation of abdominal circumference (AC) is especially difficult to perform automatically because the abdomen has low contrast against surroundings, non-uniform contrast, and irregular shape compared to other parameters. We propose a method for the automatic estimation of the fetal AC from 2 D ultrasound data through a specially designed convolutional neural network (CNN), which takes account of doctors' decision process, anatomical structure, and the characteristics of the ultrasound image. The proposed method uses CNN to classify ultrasound images (stomach bubble, amniotic fluid, and umbilical vein) and Hough transformation for measuring AC. We test the proposed method using clinical ultrasound data acquired from 56 pregnant women. Experimental results show that, with relatively small training samples, the proposed CNN provides sufficient classification results for AC estimation through the Hough transformation. The proposed method automatically estimates AC from ultrasound images. The method is quantitatively evaluated, and shows stable performance in most cases and even for ultrasound images deteriorated by shadowing artifacts. As a result of experiments for our <b>acceptance</b> <b>check,</b> the accuracies are 0. 809 and 0. 771 with the expert 1 and expert 2, respectively, while the accuracy between the two experts is 0. 905.

40|$|SUMMARY OF REQUIREMENTS AND BRIEF DESCRIPTIONS Varsity WF. 415 was {{delivered}} {{as a standard}} aircrew training aircraft and had been in storage at No. 48 MX., Hawarden, for a considerable period. Under the contract the College was required to:- 1. Prepare the aircraft for delivery flight to Cranfield, 2. Carry out a Major Inspection. 3. Embody all outstanding modifications as required by R. T. O. Vickers. 4. Convert the aircraft from military to civil category. 5. Embody the required special modifications (listed in Part 4,Section 1). 6. Maintain the aircraft {{during a period of}} proving flights and. A,R,B. Test Flights. Prior to the delivery flight a discussion took place with the S. T. O. Hawarden. On the basis of this meeting a list of minimum requirements was raised by the Chief Inspector to fitness for flight to a one flight standard. A party of College employees was sent to prepare the aircraft, the operation taking five days. On arrival at Cranfield the aircraft underwent an <b>acceptance</b> <b>check</b> and was completely stripped. The Inspection Schedule and. Varsity Modification requirements were raised. During the period required for the design of special modifications, the Major Inspection was carried out and the standard modifications embodied. It was decided that the sections of the aircraft affected by the special modifications (mainly cabin and cockpit area) would be inspected for defects and that the major inspection would be carried out on completion of these special modifications. This ensured that the spares required in these sections would. be readily available and the major inspection, when carried out, would not uncover any serious defects. To avoid unnecessary load on the Design Department it was decided that during this period certain of the special modifications should be embodied to Flight Department drawings approved by Design The work was confined to non-structural parts. This permitted completion of a considerable number of the special modifications during overhaul, thereby releasing skilled man power for the more extensive special modifications as they were designed. During the period, close liaison was maintained with Design Department to ensure that equipment required would be available on receipt of drawings, thus avoiding, as far as possible, delay due to protracted delivery dates...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{surveys the}} history of the check, from its {{beginnings}} in the eastern Mediterranean to its place atop the twentieth-century U. S. payment system. To understand the check’s path to ascendancy, we identify three critical changes in the wider payment system environment. The development of negotiability in the Low Countries during the sixteenth century encouraged wider <b>acceptance</b> of <b>checks.</b> The suppression of banknotes at various times in the Anglo-American world limited a key rival to checks. Finally, the Federal Reserve standardized check processing and subsidized inter-regional checking in the twentieth century. 1 In the early eleventh century, an Iranian traveler by the name of Nasir-i Khosrau visited the city of Basra, in present-day Iraq. There, he recorded one of the first descriptions of a form of payment known as the sakk, a merchant’s written instruction ordering his bank to make a payment from his account (Ashtor 1972). 1 The U. S. economy continues to rely on the payment instrument favored in medieval Basra. Although the number of checks written in the U. S. peaked in the mid- 1990 s, 2 Americans still wrote about 33 billion checks in 2006 (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 2007 b). Onl...|$|R

This technique is used to <b>check</b> <b>acceptance</b> standards for defects in nozzle welds and to apply modern methods of assessing the integrity of pressurised plant. Acoustic emission monitoring has been used, together with strain gauge measurements and ultrasonic scanning, to detect the occurrence of any significant defect growth during cyclic pressurisation of the vessel. During this first stage, no significant defect growth has been produced by 1000 cycles of pressure up to 24. 1 MPa (3500 psi), subsequent pressurisation up to 35. 8 MPa (5200 psi), or 97 per cent of the expected yield stress of the vessel shell.

40|$|Abstract. Bounded model {{checking}} (BMC) is {{a technique}} for overcoming the state explosion problem which has gained wide industrial <b>acceptance.</b> Bounded model <b>checking</b> is typically applied only for linear-time properties, with a few exceptions, which search for a counter-example {{in the form of}} a tree-like structure with a pre-determined shape. We suggest a new approach to bounded model checking for universal branching-time logic, in which we encode an arbitrary graph and allow the SAT solver to choose both the states and edges of the graph. This significantly reduces the size of the counter-example produced by BMC. A dynamic completeness criterion is presented which can be used to halt the bounded model checking when it becomes clear that no counterexample can exist. Thus, verification of the checked property can also be achieved. Experiments show that our approach outperforms another recent encoding for µ-calculus on complex ACTL properties. ...|$|R
40|$|Many {{software}} solutions {{have failed}} {{because they did}} not meet stakeholder needs. In response to this problem a massive amount of techniques were de-veloped to elicit stakeholder needs, to analyze the implications of these needs on the software, to specify proposed software products, and to <b>check</b> <b>acceptance</b> of these proposals. However, many of these techniques did not become industrial practice because they were not practicable or ineffective when used in real-world projects. To obtain an overview of what common practice is and to understand which techniques reflect best practice because they are particularly effective, we have surveyed a large number of industry projects. Based on 419 valid answers, this chapter gives an overview of commonly used requirements engineering techniques. It also shows which of the techniques, when used in a software project, correlate with require-ments engineering success. The chapter concludes with recommendations for software projects and future research to improve requirements engineer-ing practice...|$|R

40|$|Software {{verification}} is {{an important}} and difficult problem. Many static checking techniques for software require annotations from the programmer {{in the form of}} method specifications and loop invariants. This annotation overhead, particularly of loop invariants, is a significant hurdle in the <b>acceptance</b> of static <b>checking.</b> We reduce the annotation burden by inferring loop invariants automatically. Our method is based on predicate abstraction, an domain is constructed from a given set of predicates over program variables. A novel feature of our approach is that it infers universally-quantified loop invariants, which are crucial for verifying programs that manipulate unbounded data such as arrays. We present heuristics for generating appropriate predicates for each loop automatically; the programmer can specify additional predicates as well. We also present an efficient algorithm for computing the abstraction of a set of states in terms of a collection of predicates. Experiments on a 44 KLOC program show that our approach can automatically infer the necessary predicates and invariants for all but 31 of the 396 routines that contain loops. ...|$|R

Many acceptance test approaches use arcane formats which do not promote clarity for the customer, due to {{a conflict of interest}} between the complexities of automation and the needs of the customer. We discuss the evolution of acceptance tests to improve their clarity for the customer. Sat is an acceptance test system for testing socketbased servers with multiple clients. The first version used an XML file to define the tests in a test suite. Any errors detected were written to a text log. There were two problems with this first version. The XML format made it difficult to read and edit the tests. When an error was given, it was not easy to identify the place in the test where the problem occurred. Sat was altered to make use of Fit, a testing framework that uses HTML tables for defining tests and reporting any errors. We found the new version considerably easier to use. The tabular form makes it much simpler to read and alter the tests. Any errors are reported in a copy of the tables, in the place where they occur. We have also found it convenient to include information about the tests in the HTML, providing a form of "literate testing". 1...|$|R

The consumption of fortified products in the diet is an option for the control of deficiency diseases. This study aimed to develop enriched cheese bread with whole biofortified cowpea flour and evaluate their acceptance and chemical composition. Two formulations, F 1 and F 2, were prepared containing 5. 6 and 8 % of cowpea flour as a substitute for starch, respectively. To <b>check</b> <b>acceptance,</b> three sensory tests were used (Hedonic Scale, Purchase Intent, and Paired Comparison), F 1 being sensory viable according to assessors, being chemically analyzed. Minerals were determined by atomic emission spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma source. The moisture was determined by drying at 105 °C, ash by calcination in muffle at 550 °C, proteins by the macro-Kjeldahl method, and lipids by hot extraction in a Soxhlet extractor. Carbohydrates were obtained by difference and the calories were calculated. The addition of cowpea increased the amounts of copper, iron, phosphorus, magnesium, manganese, and zinc, as well as protein and carbohydrate values. On the other hand, there was a reduction of the moisture concerning lipids and the total caloric value compared to the standard formulation.
