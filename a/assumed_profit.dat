We appreciate the paper's extensive qualitative discussion of the nature and role of absorptive capacity. We also commend the authors' idea of constructing a mathematical model to analyze a rational firm's incentives for an investment in absorptive capacity. However, we find that the authors' model overlooks one key element of a firm's absorptive capacity, namely, the firm's ability to defend itself against the threat of an external technology. In the absence of that element, the authors' model may be able to explain a firm's incentives for an innovation rather than incentives for the development of an absorptive capacity. We also identify several internal inconsistencies in the authors' mathematical model. For example, the <b>assumed</b> <b>profit</b> maximization function seems inconsistent with the assumed degree of sophistication of the firm's probability assessment behavior. We believe that the inconsistencies and shortcomings noted here raise serious questions about the validity of the authors' findings. However, we hope that this note does not detract from the pioneering nature of the authors' work, but instead increases its value by stimulating further work on the important topic of absorptive capacity. innovation, technological change, expectation formation, absorptive capacity...|$|E

The formulated LP Model for this study <b>assumed</b> <b>profit</b> maximizing behavior a single-period planning and a certain environment. The formulated LP Model suggested no production of sole crop enterprises like cabbage onion cocoa nursery pepper grown on raised bed pepper and garden egg grown on raised bed irrigation. The model also prescribed no production for crop mixtures like garden eggokra and cabbagecucumberpepper. The formulated LP Model prescribed production of 1 acre of garden egg 3 acres of watermelon 4 acres of tomato 2 acres of cucumber 1 acre of plantain 2 acres of garden egg irrigation 1 acre of okragarden eggpepper and 1 acre of peppergarden egg. Comparison of results obtained by using existing farming plan and the LP Model indicate that results obtained from the LP Model were significant improvements of the existing farming plan. The LP Model saved 0. 2 and 0. 6 of available capital and labor requirement respectively. A 16. 25 significant increment of the net returns was obtained by the LP Model. This was as result of net returns increasing from GH 77848. 00 to GH 88177. 00. These results suggest the essence of application of formulated mathematical models like the LP Model to planning and management of limited resources...|$|E

To model this influence, we <b>assume</b> <b>profit</b> maximizing firms producing under a short run monopolistic competition regime. We emphasize that training variables, both qualitative and quantitative, can either increase labour demand through their positive effect on labour physical productivity net from the dropping price required to sell additional production, and that they can decrease labour demand through induced increasing direct labour costs and wages. GMM estimations on a panel of 269 firms observed during the period 1998 - 2004 show non significant impacts of training variables on labour demand, the productivity and cost effects seeming to offset each other. These results allow us to suggest two scenarios in terms of firms and workers behaviour and that subsidiary training could favour employment under the two assumptions that firms don’t transform training in an increased productivity – wage mark-up, but convert additional productivity in employment, and workers don’t claim for higher wages as a result of additional productivity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{estimate}} the agricultural benefits due to flood protection provided by the proposed Trinity River Project. The area examined was the land located between the 100 -year flood plain with the project and without the project. Benefits of the project were defined as reduced flood damages on current land uses and alternatively as increased net returns assuming a shift to a profit maximizing land use with flood protection provided. Annual flood damages were calculated by applying published seasonal flood damage factors and flood frequency as developed from a producer survey to annual gross returns. Annual net benefits were calculated as net returns with flood protection less net returns without flood protection. The reduction in net returns without flood protection represented annual flood damages with a constant land use assumption. The two estimates of flood protection benefits were developed for evaluation reaches 1 through 6 separately as well as on an aggregate basis. Total annual net benefits of the Trinity River Project were $ 676, 392. 43 assuming current land use and $ 4, 579, 688. 55 <b>assuming</b> <b>profit</b> maximizing land use after flood protection.

An auction with highest-rejected bid (HRB) pricing and exit bids is strategically simple, has no bid shading, and is fully efficient.

The bid shading in the LAB auction exposes bidders {{to the possibility of}} losing the auction at a price below the bidder's value. Thus, fear of losing may cause bidders in the LAB auction to bid more aggressively than predicted assuming profit-maximizing bidders. We extend the model by adding an anticipated loser's regret to the payoff function. Revenue from the LAB auction yields higher expected revenue than the HRB auction when bidders' fear of losing at profitable prices is sufficiently strong. This would provide one explanation why India, with an expressed objective of revenue maximization, adopted the LAB auction for its upcoming 3 G spectrum auction, rather than the seemingly superior HRB auction.

S. farm {{production}} expenditures related to the cost of fertilizer, seed, and chemicals, producers within the Corn Belt region are looking for new methods and/or planting processes that would deliver higher levels of production efficiencies and lower operating costs. Specifically within the planting operation, Corn Belt producers are faced with the challenge to better manage the higher cost of crop inputs in order to sustain profitability. The primary objective of this thesis is to examine new planting technologies that would better manage planting applications while directly lowering related input costs. Another objective is to understand through regression analysis how various planting variables affect yield potential. Results from the regression analysis illustrate how the various planting variables affect yield and show the importance of “realtime” planter management, advancements possible only with the new planter technology. Customer surveys and several on-site customer visits were conducted throughout the Corn Belt to better understand the actual needs of producers for new planting technologies. Throughout the customer visits, specific questions about the producers’ planting operation were asked to find new ways for precision technology to help increase overall productivity and ultimately profitability. Producer comments and feedback were analyzed through Quality Functional Deployment (QFD) practices and aligned into product development programs. The products developed from the customer research will help producers in the Corn Belt to reduce corn production inefficiencies and, potentially, increase <b>profit</b> margins, <b>assuming</b> <b>profit</b> levels remain steady and/or increase in lieu of reduced input costs.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{incentives for}} investments in transport infrastructure and commuting subsidies in a multi-region framework. Responsibilities of fiscal treatment of commuting expenses, public provision of road infrastructure and road pricing are distributed among {{different levels of}} government. The incentives of governments are discussed in a setting with commuting from a peripheral, less productive area to an urban agglomeration or city center. The interactions between investment in transport infrastructure, road pricing and commuting subsidies are analyzed. First, the optimal number of commuters {{from the point of}} view of the federation is derived in a first best situation. When a tax on labor is levied to finance the investment in transportation, a commuting subsidy can correct the labor tax distortion and the first best outcome can be obtained. However, when the peripheral region is in control of the transport policy and perceives its position as a dominant supplier of labor, the regional government will have an incentive to strategically restrict the number of commuters. This will lead to a commuting tax. In addition, there will be underinvestment in infrastructure investment. The city government faces different incentives. On the one hand, profits made in the city increase with the commuting flow. <b>Assuming</b> <b>profits</b> are captured locally, the city thus benefits from a higher number of commuters. On the other hand, the city can raise tax revenues by taxing commuters. Therefore, tax exporting behavior can be one of the drivers of the city’s transport policy. The result is a situation where the city invests in transport infrastructure to attract commuters and sets a tax on commuters to raise government revenues. We show that the intensity of the regional strategic behavior is affected by firm ownership structure, the number of labor-supplying regions and the revenue-sharing mechanism in the federation. The paper also looks into vertical tax competition and identifies possibilities for the federal government to correct the incentive structure through mechanism design. A numerical example illustrates the insights for commuting in Belgium. ...|$|R
