40|$|We {{have shown}} that the VPt 3 (V 0. 25 Pt 0. 75) alloy becomes {{ferromagnetic}} in each of both atomically ordered states with Cu 3 Au and TiAl 3 crystalline structure, respectively. The atomically disordered VPt 3 alloy (with a Cu like fcc structure), remains paramagnetic over the whole temperature range 4. 2 K to 1 100 K. By means of remanent magnetization measurements, we found the ferromagnetic Curie points Tc ≃ 240 K for VPt 3 ordered in the Cu 3 Au like structure (VPt 3 (1) sample) and Tc ≃ 210 K for VPt 3 ordered in the TiAl 3 structure (VPt 3 (2) sample). Magnetization measurements performed at low temperatures (4. 2 K to 160 K) and in moderate fields (0 ≤ H ≤ 20 kOe) showed that both VPt 3 (1) and (2) samples behave as classical ferromagnets. The high field (0 < H ≤ 150 kOe) magnetization measurements performed on both VPt 3 (1) and (2) samples at 4. 2 K, allowed an accurate determination of the saturation magnetization σ s (4. 2 K) and of the high field χH (4. 2 K) susceptibility. The order of magnitude of the χH susceptibility (at 4. 2 K, χH ∼ 1 x 10 - 6 emu. g- 1. Oe - 1) is consistent with band paramagnetism of transition metals. Both VPt 3 (1) and (2) may be considered as weak ferromagnets, in view of their small ferromagnetic moment (μ 0 ∼ 0. 1 μB per V <b>atom-gram).</b> The paramagnetic behaviour of VPt 3 (1) and (2) above their respective Curie points, is well described by a Curie-Weiss law yielding small paramagnetic moment values (μ ' ∼ 0. 7 μB per V <b>atom-gram).</b> In spite of all experimental results obtained in this work, we could not settle with certainty whether the ferromagnetic behaviour of both ordered VPt 3 alloys has to be interpreted in a localized model of ferromagnetism rather than in an itinerant one. Nevertheless, we have interpreted the ferromagnetic behaviour of VPt 3 (1) and (2) within a model of localized ferromagnetism : the ferromagnetism in VPt 3 (1) and (2) is tentatively ascribed to a mechanism of indirect exchange interaction between the V moments through the conduction electrons of the Pt atoms. In this mechanism, the Pt electrons acquire a magnetic polarization antiparallel to the V moments...|$|E
