5|$|A Big Ten Conference preseason media poll, {{announced}} at its October 31 media-day conference, predicted that Michigan would finish second to rival Michigan State (ahead of Ohio State) and selected McGary <b>and</b> <b>Robinson</b> for its preseason All-Big Ten team. A Big Ten Network media poll, announced {{the day before}} and providing additional detail, also selected McGary <b>and</b> <b>Robinson</b> for its All-Big Ten Conference team. McGary <b>and</b> <b>Robinson</b> were on the 50-man Naismith Award and Wooden Award preseason watchlists. A poll of Big Ten beat writers also selected Michigan to edge out Ohio State for second place. Michigan began the season ninth in the preseason Coaches' Poll and seventh in the AP Poll.|$|E

5|$|The {{next day}} Archer discovers Robinson packing up the {{contents}} of his locker. He concedes that it is primarily an intermix problem, but that the engine could still work. Archer <b>and</b> <b>Robinson</b> then steal the NX Beta, with Tucker in flight control, but it starts to suffer the same issues as the Alpha. As Starfleet security detains Tucker, Archer <b>and</b> <b>Robinson</b> manage to coax the engines towards their goal of warp 2.5. Afterwards, Archer <b>and</b> <b>Robinson</b> are reprimanded by Starfleet, and the Vulcans ground the program for a year, but they eventually confirm that his father's design was sound. Back in the future, Archer launches the charges into the cloud, and T'Pol suggests that it be named after Archer's close friend, Robinson.|$|E

5|$|After his discharge, Robinson briefly {{returned}} to his old football club, the Los Angeles Bulldogs. Robinson then accepted an offer from his old friend and pastor Rev. Karl Downs to be the athletic director at Sam Huston College in Austin, then of the Southwestern Athletic Conference. The job included coaching the school's basketball team for the 1944–45 season. As it was a fledgling program, few students tried out for the basketball team, <b>and</b> <b>Robinson</b> even resorted to inserting himself into the lineup for exhibition games. Although his teams were outmatched by opponents, Robinson was respected as a disciplinarian coach, and drew the admiration of, among others, Langston University basketball player Marques Haynes, a future member of the Harlem Globetrotters.|$|E

5|$|Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson are {{credited}} with creating the Joker, but their {{accounts of the}} character's conception differ, each providing {{his own version of}} events.

5|$|Calls by the {{legislature}} for Magoffin's resignation had begun as early as September 30, 1861. On August 16, 1862, Magoffin declared his willingness to resign {{on the condition that}} he be allowed to choose his successor. Because Lieutenant Governor Linn Boyd had died in office in 1859, Speaker of the Senate John F. Fisk was next in line for the governorship. Magoffin refused to accept Fisk as his successor, so Fisk resigned as speaker and the senate elevated Magoffin's choice, James F. Robinson, to speaker. Magoffin resigned as governor on August 18, 1862, <b>and</b> <b>Robinson</b> assumed the office of governor for the remainder of Magoffin's term.|$|E
