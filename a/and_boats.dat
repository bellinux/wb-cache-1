5|$|There are {{traffic lights}} on the short section between Brayford Pool and Stamp End Lock, which are used to {{indicate}} {{the state of the}} river in times of flood. Green indicates that flows are low or normal, <b>and</b> <b>boats</b> can proceed along this stretch. Red indicates that flows are high and that great care is required. Flashing red indicates that flows are very high <b>and</b> <b>boats</b> must not use the section.|$|E
5|$|After {{the passage}} of Typhoon Mamie, more than 800,000civilians and 9,000 {{soldiers}} were organized {{in order to protect}} reservoirs from flooding. By August28, 150,000civilians and 10,000soldiers were fighting against flooding along the Liao River on a daily basis. Additionally, local military forces were called in to assist relief workers. The government organized buses <b>and</b> <b>boats</b> to carry flood victims. Some schools were used as shelter while restaurants and hospitals sent food and medicine.|$|E

5|$|No {{significant}} impact {{was reported in}} Canada, as the strongest winds were south and east of the center. Prior to the storm's arrival, the Newfoundland Weather Forecast Office issued a hurricane warning for southeastern Newfoundland. The ferry between Nova Scotia and Newfoundland was disrupted, <b>and</b> <b>boats</b> across the region were sent back to harbor. Rainfall was fairly light, peaking at 2.39inches (60.8mm) in southeastern Newfoundland, and sustained winds reached 71mph (115km/h) at Cape Race.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the outward}} {{terminal}} {{of the line}} {{was to be the}} quay at Watchet, the west pier had been practically unusable for some considerable time, <b>and</b> <b>boats</b> were beached and loaded direct from carts brought on to the foreshore. After considerable public pressure, the Watchet Harbour Act was passed in 1857, placing it under the control of Commissioners; they built a new east pier and rebuilt the west pier; the work was finished in 1862, and 500ton vessels could enter the harbour. The WSMR used the west pier, and the newly arrived, broad gauge West Somerset Railway, a branch from the Bristol and Exeter Railway, used the east pier.|$|E

5|$|As an extratropical storm over Newfoundland, Florence {{produced}} powerful winds peaking at 101mph (163km/h) {{and moderate}} amounts of rainfall {{of up to}} 2.6inches (67mm). Flooding and power outages were reported, although they were isolated. The hurricane caused flight interruptions at St. John's International Airport and also to the Trans Canada ferry between Newfoundland and Cape Breton Island in eastern Nova Scotia. Strong winds destroyed {{a house in the}} small Newfoundland village of Francois. Residents in Francois agreed to rebuild the wrecked home while the family temporarily resided in a summer home of another family. The winds also caused damage to shingles and sides of homes, while the strong waves damaged roads <b>and</b> <b>boats</b> along the Burin Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Commander David W. Bagley, the destroyer's commander, {{ordered all}} life rafts <b>and</b> <b>boats</b> launched. As the ship sank, her bow {{raised in the}} air almost {{vertically}} before she began to slip beneath the waves. At this point the armed depth charges began to explode, killing a number of {{men who had been}} unable to escape the destroyer, and stunning many others in the water. The destroyer, the first United States destroyer ever lost to enemy action, sank eight minutes after the torpedo struck the rudder, taking with her two officers and 64 men.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{navigation}} being closed, {{a guide to}} Midhurst published in 1895 advertised that skiffs could be hired, and fishing could be enjoyed. The boats were hired out by a plumber called William Port, and his business continued to prosper until 1912, when his boathouse burned down. Rowing boats were also available for hire at Coultershaw and Fittleworth. Another book called A New Oarsman's Guide, published in 1896, suggested that the river could be canoed from Iping to the Arun, a distance of , when there was sufficient water. By that time, none of the locks were workable, <b>and</b> <b>boats</b> had to be carried around them.|$|E
50|$|Over {{the years}} a <b>boat</b> club, {{boathouse}} <b>and</b> <b>boat</b> service (with rowing <b>boats</b> <b>and</b> pedalling <b>boats</b> <b>and</b> a public ferry) {{for the public}} and tourists has become fully functional and is of aesthetic significance for tourism. <b>Boat</b> Pageant <b>and</b> Flower Shows are a regular feature in the summer season which attracts tourists.|$|R

5|$|October 10, 1894 10 People {{were killed}} and 15 injured at 74 Monroe Street in Manhattan when winds blew a {{building}} under construction onto a tenement crushing it. Extensive damage in the NYC and Long Island to telegraph lines, trees <b>and</b> <b>boats</b> docked on shore. Storm formed over Gulf of Mexico as a Category 3 weakened over land in the Southeast and re strengthened to a Category 1 over the Chesapeake Bay before striking Long Island.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the oldest}} {{buildings}} in Herne Bay is the late 18th-century inn, The Ship, which served as the focal point for the small shipping and farming community which first inhabited the town. During this time, passenger and cargo boats regularly ran between Herne Bay and London <b>and</b> <b>boats</b> carrying coal ran from Newcastle. From Herne was easy access by road {{to the city of}} Canterbury or to Dover, where further passage by boat could then be obtained across the English Channel to France.|$|E
5|$|Operation Anger (sometimes {{known as}} Operation Quick Anger), was a {{military}} operation to seize the city of Arnhem in April 1945, during the closing stages of the Second World War. It is occasionally {{referred to as the}} Second Battle of Arnhem or the Liberation of Arnhem. The operation was part of the Canadian First Army's liberation of the Netherlands and was led by the 49th British Infantry Division, supported by armour of the 5th Canadian Armoured Division, Royal Air Force air strikes <b>and</b> <b>boats</b> of the Royal Navy.|$|E

Gasoline powered boats were prohibited.|$|R
5|$|Silicon nitride {{remained}} {{merely a}} chemical curiosity for decades {{before it was}} used in commercial applications. From 1948 to 1952, the Carborundum Company, Niagara Falls, New York, applied for several patents on the manufacture and application of silicon nitride. By 1958 Haynes (Union Carbide) silicon nitride was in commercial production for thermocouple tubes, rocket nozzles, <b>and</b> <b>boats</b> and crucibles for melting metals. British work on silicon nitride, started in 1953, was aimed at high-temperature parts of gas turbines and resulted {{in the development of}} reaction-bonded silicon nitride and hot-pressed silicon nitride. In 1971, the Advanced Research Project Agency of the US Department of Defense placed a US$17million contract with Ford and Westinghouse for two ceramic gas turbines.|$|E
5|$|Strategic {{deception}} included increasing {{military activity}} far away, near Moscow. At {{the sites of}} the planned attack, elaborate disinformation was fed to the enemy. Defence lines were built to deceive German tactical reconnaissance. Civilians within 25 kilometres of the front were evacuated, and trenches were dug around the villages for Luftwaffe reconnaissance to see. Conversely, along the uninvolved Voronezh Front, bridging equipment <b>and</b> <b>boats</b> were prepared to suggest an offensive there. The five real bridges that were built for the attack were masked by the construction of seventeen false bridges over the River Don.|$|E
5|$|Supermarkets, {{convenience}} stores, and {{gas stations}} in New Jersey rarely sell alcoholic beverages because state law prohibits any person or corporation from possessing {{more than two}} retail distribution licenses. While licenses for bars, restaurants and liquor stores are limited, other retail licenses are not. Class C licenses can be granted without limit for common carriers (such as limousines <b>and</b> <b>boats),</b> private clubs {{with a minimum of}} 60 members, hotels with at least one-hundred rooms, and theatres with at least 1,000 seats.|$|E

5|$|The ensuing {{confusion}} allowed Belvidera to fire her stern chasers, killing {{six more}} men aboard President. Rodgers {{kept up the}} pursuit, using his bow chasers to severely damage Belvideras rigging, but his two broadsides had little effect. The crew of Belvidera quickly made repairs to the rigging. They cut loose her anchors <b>and</b> <b>boats</b> and pumped drinking water overboard to lighten her load, thereby increasing her speed. Belvidera soon gained enough speed to distance herself from President, and Rodgers abandoned the pursuit. Belvidera sailed to Halifax to deliver the news that war had been declared.|$|E
5|$|The first Battersea Bridge was a toll bridge {{commissioned}} by John, Earl Spencer, {{who had recently}} acquired the rights to operate the ferry. Although a stone bridge was planned, difficulties in raising investment meant that a cheaper wooden bridge was built instead. Designed by Henry Holland, it was initially opened to pedestrians in November 1771, and to vehicle traffic in 1772. The bridge was inadequately designed and dangerous both to its users and to passing shipping, <b>and</b> <b>boats</b> often collided with it. To reduce the dangers to shipping, two piers were removed and the sections of the bridge above them were strengthened with iron girders.|$|E
5|$|The {{inhabitants}} {{were growing}} desperate {{to remove their}} belongings from the City, especially the upper class. This provided a {{source of income for}} the able-bodied poor, who hired out as porters (sometimes simply making off with the goods), and it was especially profitable for the owners of carts <b>and</b> <b>boats.</b> Hiring a cart had cost a couple of shillings on the Saturday before the fire; on Monday, it rose to as much as £40, a fortune equivalent to more than £4,000 in 2005.|$|E
