5|$|Although {{important}} to the local economy with spending generating over £53,000,000 GVA, Christchurch is not so heavily dependent on tourism as some of its neighbours. Tourism's contribution to the local economy is about 9% compared to 18% for Weymouth and Portland, 15% for Purbeck and 12% for Bournemouth. Visitor accommodation consists of 11 caravan and camping parks and some 900 bed spaces in eight hotels and 75 guest houses <b>and</b> <b>bed</b> and breakfast establishments.|$|E

It is also home to a range of cultural, sporting and religious sites including the 15th century Church of St John the Baptist. The capital city of New Zealand is named after Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, thus his title comes from the town of Wellington, Somerset, England.|$|E

5|$|Cyclone Fanele {{struck the}} country during a series of {{government}} protests, and consequently the national government provided little response to the storm. Instead, United Nations (UN) agencies quickly provided relief to affected citizens. The World Food Programme prepared 87metric tons (MT) of cereal and 13MT of various types of pulses. Five United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) trucks arrived in Morondova on January25 with various supplies. In {{the days after the}} storm, contaminated floodwaters resulted in cases of dysentery. To prevent the spread of disease, UNICEF provided vaccines, de-worming tablets, and water cleaning devices. Within three days of the storm's landfall, the agency also began distributing health kits <b>and</b> <b>bed</b> nets. As many schools were affected, UNICEF set up temporary classrooms in tents, while workers began fixing and cleaning the damaged buildings. Despite the quick response by the UN, thousands of people were left without aid. The Malagasy Red Cross deployed its volunteers to affected areas, although disrupted transportation services and the political situation hindered relief efforts.|$|E
5|$|To {{the eastern}} {{transept}} is the Mother-of-Pearl Bed (พระแท่นบรรทมประดับมุก) {{which was made}} to match the Mother-of-Pearl Throne. The bed was once the king's personal bed and was kept inside the Phra Thinang Phiman Rattaya; however once {{it was no longer}} used it was transferred to the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall. The bed {{is in the form of}} a high platform with many layers, and small steps leading to the top. When royal ceremonies are carried out within the throne hall, member of the royal family take their seat in the southern transept, while government officials sit to the north, Buddhist monks to the east; the funeral urn is to the west. During such times the throne <b>and</b> <b>bed</b> were used as altars for Buddha images.|$|E

The Bride Wore Black (1968), a brutal tale of revenge, is a stylish {{homage to the}} films of Alfred Hitchcock (once again starring Jeanne Moreau). Mississippi Mermaid (1969), with Catherine Deneuve, is an identity-bending romantic thriller. Stolen Kisses (1968) <b>and</b> <b>Bed</b> and Board (1970) are continuations of the Antoine Doinel Cycle, both starring Claude Jade as Antoine's fiancée and later wife Christine Darbon. The Wild Child (1970) included Truffaut's acting debut in the lead role of 18th century physician Jean Marc Gaspard Itard.|$|E
25|$|Women {{who attend}} the Wesleyan Methodist girls' school, Queen Sālote College, are taught several Western handicrafts, such as {{embroidery}} and crochet. They {{learn to make}} embroidered pillowcases <b>and</b> <b>bed</b> coverings or crocheted lace tablecloths, bedcovers, and lace trim. However, Western-style handicrafts such as these have not become widely popular outside the school setting. They require expensive imported materials {{that can only be}} purchased in major towns. Village women {{are much more likely to}} turn their efforts to weaving mats or beating barkcloth, which can be done with free local material.|$|E
25|$|A gentry {{household}} in the 17th century accommodated visitors.

The screen at right angles to the doorway prevented draughts through the bed curtains. An adjoining dressing room or closet is used to display reproduction costumes. The warm colours of the panelling <b>and</b> <b>bed</b> curtains are echoed in the carpet on the table, a feature of wealthier 17th-century houses. Tables or beds were ideal places to display a fine carpet too valuable to walk upon.|$|E

25|$|Diagnosed with {{abdominal}} {{cancer in}} 1941, Matisse underwent surgery {{that left him}} chair <b>and</b> <b>bed</b> bound. Painting and sculpture had become physical challenges, so he turned to {{a new type of}} medium. With the help of his assistants, he began creating cut paper collages, or decoupage. He would cut sheets of paper, pre-painted with gouache by his assistants, into shapes of varying colours and sizes, and arrange them to form lively compositions. Initially, these pieces were modest in size, but eventually transformed into murals or room-sized works. The result was a distinct and dimensional complexity—an art form that was not quite painting, but not quite sculpture.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, local {{farmer and}} teacher Ron Purvis adapted the skil-saw concept by {{implementing}} a diamond rotary blade. This enabled the carving {{of the many}} immense jade boulders which line the banks <b>and</b> <b>bed</b> of the Fraser and Bridge Rivers, which were {{on the one hand}} immovable and on the other would shatter or striate if blasting was used to break them. Purvis' innovation was revolutionary in the jade mining business and larger versions of his saw are at use in the Cassiar region. There are no major commercial jade mines in the Lillooet area today, although local shops still carry polished jade souvenirs.|$|E
25|$|A sleep {{disorder}}, or somnipathy, is {{a medical}} disorder of the sleep patterns of a person or animal. Polysomnography is a test commonly used for diagnosing some sleep disorders. Sleep disorders are broadly classified into dyssomnias, parasomnias, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, and other disorders including ones caused by medical or psychological conditions and sleeping sickness. Some common sleep disorders include insomnia (chronic inability to sleep), sleep apnea (abnormally low breathing during sleep), narcolepsy (excessive sleepiness at inappropriate times), cataplexy (sudden and transient loss of muscle tone), and sleeping sickness (disruption of sleep cycle due to infection). Other disorders that are being studied include sleepwalking, sleep terror <b>and</b> <b>bed</b> wetting.|$|E
