Exploring autobiographical expression from different perspectives, the thirty essays in this book were presented at an international conference held at Södertörn University in 2014. As the essays in this anthology suggest, literary critics and authors alike are rethinking autobiographical writing and its definitions.

5000|$|The growing {{popularity}} of ebooks and ereading devices has inspired the development of software - such as Authorgraph (formerly known as Kindlegraph and renamed to reflect its expansion to include all ereading platforms) and <b>Autography</b> (for iOS devices) - that allows authors to digitally personalize ebooks, by including autographs, dedications, and photographs, and to provide such personalization remotely {{as well as at}} in-person book signings. Such software benefits authors, [...] "who are not obliged to go on long distance promotional tours in order to autograph e-books for their fans", as well as those readers who are unwilling or unable to brave crowds and longs lines at onsite book signings.

The ending of the film was a tribute to John Huston's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Gary Cooper was hired to play Paddy Carmody, but had to leave due to poor health. He was replaced by Robert Mitchum, who agreed to work on the film for a chance to appear opposite Deborah Kerr, with whom he had become good friends while making Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison together.

50|$|Larchwood {{was founded}} about 1872 {{by a group}} of McLean County, Illinois land {{developers}} Jesse W. Fell (10 November 1808 - 25 February 1887) and Charles W. Holder (25 September 1819 - 10 April 1900). Fell was born in Pennsylvania, had settled in Bloomington, Illinois, in 1831 and had played an active role in founding many Illinois towns including Clinton, Normal, Pontiac, and Towanda. He was a close friend of Abraham Lincoln, and with his brother Kersey Fell had persuaded Lincoln to write his famous <b>autography.</b> He was nationally known for his love of trees. Holder was a partner in many of Fell’s projects including Towanda and Normal. Holder, Illinois was named in his honor. In the summer of 1869 Fell traveled to northwestern Iowa and selected a tract of about forty sections, more than 25000 acre of land. Fell wrote, “I have never beheld such a large body of surpassingly beautiful prairie as is here to be found. There is absolutely no waste of land, and scarce a quarter of a section not affording an admirable building site.” Holder then entered the land. Larchwood was established at the center of their holdings. Fell frequently visited the site and in May 1873 personally supervised the planting of some 100,000 saplings and tree cuttings. The town did not grow as rapidly as expected and in 1881 the development was sold to an Englishman Richard Sykes.|$|E

For example, Pierce is nearly president, Pony was killed trying to save Dan, and Amy only has {{a few more days}} to live due to the undiluted serum she took to save Dan. Galt and Cara Pierce, the children of J. Rutherford Pierce, begin to interrogate Dan by injecting him with sodium pentathol, or truth serum. They ask him about the antidote to the serum which Dan and the others are trying to create. Galt states how Pierce decoded Olivia Cahill's Household Book, which tells how to create the antidote. However, Dan retaliates by saying how Pierce [...] "figured out our secret recipe for potato salad". By the end of the interrogation, they have confirmed that the last antidote ingredient is in Angkor, Cambodia. Angkor {{was one of the most}} developed societies of the ancient world. Dan inhales chloroform in order to pass out. Galt repeatedly wants to kill Dan, while Cara wants to keep him for further interrogation. They plan to fly to Cambodia in order to thwart the Cahills' plans. Meanwhile, in Guatemala, Amy drives like a NASCAR driver on a road meant for ox carts. They almost crash into an enormous logging truck, but due to Amy's enhanced powers, they are saved. In the car are Ian Kabra, the Rosenbloom brothers, and Amy Cahill. They discuss the venom of the Tonle Sap snake, which is the final ingredient to the antidote. When they reach Guatemala City, they board Jonah's Gulfstream G6.

40|$|Fibrin/agar {{films were}} {{prepared}} {{and used to}} detect plasminogen activators produced by cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (fibrin <b>autography).</b> One preparation of fibrin underwent spontaneous lysis upon incubation at 37 degrees C. This lysis was prevented by antibodies to tissue-type plasminogen activator but not by antibodies to urokinase. Conditioned medium from the confluent endothelial cells was fractionated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis {{in the presence of}} NaDodSO 4. The gels were analyzed on indicator films prepared with the spontaneously lysing fibrin (reverse fibrin <b>autography).</b> Unexpectedly, as the opaque fibrin film cleared, a distinct lysis-resistant zone appeared in the indicator gel at a region corresponding to Mr 55, 000. Experiments were devised to determine whether the lysis-resistant zone in the indicator film reflected the presence of a cellular inhibitor in the polyacrylamide gel. The corresponding region was excised from a polyacrylamide gel, extracted with buffer, and tested directly for antifibrinolytic activity by the 125 I-labeled fibrin plate method. Urokinase-mediated fibrinolytic activity was inhibited by the gel extract in a dose-dependent manner indicating the presence of such an inhibitor. Inhibitor activity was detected in Triton X- 100 extracts of washed monolayers and in conditioned medium, where it accumulated with time. The endothelial cell inhibitor not only survived exposure to NaDodSO 4 but also was active after incubation at pH 12 or treatment with 5 % (vol/vol) 2 -mercaptoethanol, 6 M urea, 4 M guanidine hydrochloride, or 1 M acetic acid. Considerable activity also remained after heating at 100 degrees C for 30 min. These results indicate that cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells synthesize and secrete a previously undetected, unusually stable fibrinolytic inhibitor of Mr 55, 000.

40|$|We {{determined}} plasminogen activator (PA) and PA inhibitor (PAI) {{activities in}} the intra- and extracellular compartments of an experimental pancreatic ascites tumour with indirect and direct functional assays, and partially characterized these activities on SDS-polyacrylamide gels coupled with fibrin and reverse fibrin <b>autography.</b> Intact tumour cells caused lysis of plasminogen-rich but not plasminogen-free fibrin clots, {{and the extent of}} lysis of the former was related to tumour cell count. Direct assay of PA with a synthetic substrate yielded an equivalent of 109 urokinase units per 10 (9) tumour cells. No PAI activity was demonstrated in tumour cells with functional assays. Contrary to tumour cells, cell-free ascitic fluids caused no lysis of fibrin clots. Instead, it inhibited tumour cell- and urokinase-induced, but not plasmin-induced, clot lysis in a dose-dependent fashion. Although functional assays failed to demonstrate PA in ascitic fluid and PAI in tumour cells, both activities were detected in electrophoresed samples of cell lysates and fluids by fibrin and reverse fibrin <b>autography.</b> In tumour cells, a mixture of tissue-type PA (tPA) and urokinase-type PA (uPA) were present.

40|$|Monospecific {{antiserum}} to {{an unusually}} stable Mr 50, 000 plasminogen-activator inhibitor (PAI) purified from cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells was employed {{in conjunction with}} reverse fibrin <b>autography</b> to determine whether human platelets, serum, and plasma contain immunologically related inhibitors. Reverse fibrin <b>autography</b> revealed {{the presence of a}} Mr 50, 000 inhibitor in the platelet and serum samples but not in normal plasma. However, a Mr 50, 000 inhibitor was detected in plasma obtained from individuals with increased PAI activity. In each case, treatment of the sample with the anti-inhibitor serum removed the Mr 50, 000 inhibitor. The inhibitor present in each sample neutralized exogenously added tissue-type plasminogen activator in a rapid manner. Inhibition was associated with the formation of a NaDodSO 4 -resistant enzyme-inhibitor complex of Mr 120, 000. Again, treatment of the samples with the anti-inhibitor serum removed both the inhibitory activity and the component in these samples that binds to tissue-type plasminogen activator. Thus, the rapidly acting PAI present in human platelets, serum, and patient plasma is immunologically related to the PAI synthesized by cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells. This molecule may be the physiologically relevant inhibitor of plasminogen activator in the vascular system and, as such, may serve an important role in regulating the initiation of vascular fibrinolysis...|$|E
