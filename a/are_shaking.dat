5|$|In {{the poem}} Lokasenna, the half-god Loki angrily flyts with the gods {{in the sea}} entity Ægir's hall. Thor does not attend the event, however, as he is away in the east for {{unspecified}} purposes. Towards {{the end of the}} poem, the flyting turns to Sif, Thor's wife, whom Loki then claims to have slept with. The god Freyr's servant Beyla interjects, and says that, since all of the mountains <b>are</b> <b>shaking,</b> she thinks that Thor is on his way home. Beyla adds that Thor will bring peace to the quarrel, to which Loki responds with insults.|$|E

25|$|Active {{systems are}} {{designed}} for three-dimensional noise cancellation. To implement an active system, low-noise fluxgate magnetometers are mounted {{at the center of}} each surface and oriented orthogonally to it. This negatively feeds a DC amplifier through a low-pass network with a slow falloff to minimize positive feedback and oscillation. Built into the system <b>are</b> <b>shaking</b> and degaussing wires. Shaking wires increase the magnetic permeability, while the permanent degaussing wires are applied to all surfaces of the inner main layer to degauss the surfaces. Moreover, noise cancellation algorithms can reduce both low-frequency and high-frequency noise. Modern systems have a noise floor of around 2–3fT/Hz0.5 above 1Hz.|$|E

Dementia becomes common in the advanced stages of the disease. Depression and anxiety are also common occurring in {{more than a third of}} people with PD.

(Nine hundred {{was roughly}} {{the number of}} men in a single {{infantry}} battalion, and as regiments were formed on local lines, most would have been from the same county; it is thus emphasised that his crime is a black mark against both the regiment, as a whole, and against his comrades.)

Loki [...] "takes the horn," [...] drinks it, and says that she would be, if it were so, and states that Sif had a lover beside Thor, namely, Loki himself (an event that is otherwise unattested). Beyla (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says that all of the mountains <b>are</b> <b>shaking,</b> that she thinks Thor must be on his way home, and when Thor arrives he will bring peace to those that quarrel there.
