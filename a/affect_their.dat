5|$|During the 20th {{century and}} {{following}} the wide-scale adoption of the scientific method, astrology has been challenged successfully on both theoretical and experimental grounds, and {{has been shown to}} have no scientific validity or explanatory power. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and common belief in it has largely declined. While polling studies have demonstrated that approximately 25% of Americans, Canadians, and Britons say they continue to believe that star and planet positions <b>affect</b> <b>their</b> lives, astrology is now recognized as pseudoscience.|$|E
5|$|It is conjectured that a {{progressive}} decline in hormone levels with age is partially responsible for weakened immune responses in aging individuals. Conversely, some hormones are {{regulated by the}} immune system, notably thyroid hormone activity. The age-related decline in immune function is also related to decreasing vitamin D levels in the elderly. As people age, two things happen that negatively <b>affect</b> <b>their</b> vitamin D levels. First, they stay indoors more due to decreased activity levels. This means that they get less sun and therefore produce less cholecalciferol via UVB radiation. Second, as a person ages the skin becomes less adept at producing vitamin D.|$|E

5|$|The hardest natural {{diamonds}} mostly {{originate from}} the Copeton and Bingara fields {{located in the}} New England area in New South Wales, Australia. These diamonds are generally small, perfect to semiperfect octahedra, and are used to polish other diamonds. Their hardness {{is associated with the}} crystal growth form, which is single-stage crystal growth. Most other diamonds show more evidence of multiple growth stages, which produce inclusions, flaws, and defect planes in the crystal lattice, all of which <b>affect</b> <b>their</b> hardness. It is possible to treat regular diamonds under a combination of high pressure and high temperature to produce diamonds that are harder than the diamonds used in hardness gauges.|$|E
5|$|Animals are {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} diseases and conditions that may <b>affect</b> <b>their</b> health. Some, like classical swine fever and scrapie are specific to one type of stock, while others, like foot-and-mouth disease affect all cloven-hoofed animals. Where the condition is serious, governments impose regulations on import and export, on the movement of stock, quarantine restrictions and the reporting of suspected cases. Vaccines are available against certain diseases, and antibiotics are widely used where appropriate. At one time, antibiotics were routinely added to certain compound foodstuffs to promote growth, but this practice is now frowned on in many countries because of the risk that it may lead to antibiotic resistance. Animals living under intensive conditions are particularly prone to internal and external parasites; increasing numbers of sea lice are affecting farmed salmon in Scotland. Reducing the parasite burdens of livestock results in increased productivity and profitability.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} primates, {{one of the}} {{principal}} threats to both ruffed lemur species is habitat loss due to slash-and-burn agriculture, logging, and mining. Both species appear to be very sensitive to logging, and are thought to be the most vulnerable of rainforest lemurs. The hardwoods that are favored for construction materials and selectively logged are also preferred by ruffed lemurs for their fruits and potentially <b>affect</b> <b>their</b> travel routes through the canopy. Deforestation, on the other hand, {{is a result of the}} need to provide firewood and to support subsistence agriculture and cash crops. For red ruffed lemurs, Slash-and-burn agriculture, known locally as tavy, is practiced seasonally on the Masoala peninsula between October and December, and its practice is expanding. Additionally, cattle are sometimes allowed to free-range over these former agricultural clearings, preventing forest re-growth.|$|E

5|$|Director Pete Docter {{first began}} writing Up in 2004. The fantasy of a flying house was {{developed}} {{on the idea}} of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating, which stemmed from his difficulty with social situations growing up. Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the way that they <b>affect</b> <b>their</b> view of the world was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl {{in the way that they}} relate to their grandparents.|$|E
5|$|In chapter five Goldacre {{suggests}} {{using the}} General Practice Research Database in the UK, which contains the anonymized records of several million patients, to conduct randomized trials {{to determine the}} most effective of competing treatments. For example, to compare two statins, atorvastatin and simvastatin, doctors would randomly assign patients to one or the other. The patients would be followed up by having data about their cholesterol levels, heart attacks, strokes and deaths taken from their computerized medical records. The trials would not be blind‚Äì patients would know which statin they had been prescribed‚Äì but Goldacre writes {{that they would be}} unlikely to hold such firm beliefs about which one is preferable {{to the extent that it}} could <b>affect</b> <b>their</b> health.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May 2010, {{two days}} {{after the end of the}} 2009‚Äì10 season, West Ham {{announced}} the termination of Zola's contract with immediate effect. On 3 June 2010, Avram Grant signed a four-year deal to become the next manager of West Ham subject to a work permit. West Ham's form continued to be poor with the team seldom outside the relegation zone, placing Grant's future as manager under serious doubt. A 4‚Äì0 Football League Cup quarter-final win over Manchester United was an otherwise bright spot in a disappointing season. West Ham's form in the Premier League did not <b>affect</b> <b>their</b> form in the two domestic cups. The Hammers reached the semi-final of the League Cup before being eliminated by eventual winners Birmingham City as well as the quarter final of the FA cup before a 2‚Äì1 defeat at Stoke City.|$|E

5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} refers to {{issues at the}} theoretical foundations of modern psychology. Some of these issues are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of behavior to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on mental perception and thought processes? If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases {{in which there is}} no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may <b>affect</b> <b>their</b> responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on a Likert scale, they may be experiencing very different things.|$|E
5|$|Since medical {{literature}} began to describe homosexuality, {{it has often}} been approached from a view that sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the root cause, influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud. Although he considered bisexuality inherent in all people, and said that most have phases of homosexual attraction or experimentation, exclusive same-sex attraction he attributed to stunted development resulting from trauma or parental conflicts. Much literature on mental health and lesbians centered on their depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Although these issues exist among lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely <b>affect</b> <b>their</b> mental health.|$|E
5|$|Spiders have {{developed}} several different respiratory anatomies, based on book lungs, a tracheal system, or both. Mygalomorph and Mesothelae spiders have {{two pairs of}} book lungs filled with haemolymph, where openings on the ventral surface of the abdomen allow air to enter and diffuse oxygen. This {{is also the case}} for some basal araneomorph spiders, like the family Hypochilidae, but the remaining members of this group have just the anterior pair of book lungs intact while the posterior pair of breathing organs are partly or fully modified into tracheae, through which oxygen is diffused into the haemolymph or directly to the tissue and organs. The trachea system has most likely evolved in small ancestors to help resist desiccation. The trachea were originally connected to the surroundings through a pair of openings called spiracles, but in the majority of spiders this pair of spiracles has fused into a single one in the middle, and moved backwards close to the spinnerets. Spiders that have tracheae generally have higher metabolic rates and better water conservation. Spiders are ectotherms, so environmental temperatures <b>affect</b> <b>their</b> activity.|$|E
