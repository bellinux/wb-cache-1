5|$|Andrée {{resisted}} Ekholm's criticisms to {{the point}} of deception. On the boat back from Svalbard, Ekholm learned from the chief engineer of the hydrogen plant the explanation of some anomalies he had noticed in his measurements: Andrée had from time to time secretly ordered extra topping-up of the hydrogen in the balloon. Andrée's motives for such self-destructive behavior are not known. Several modern writers, following Sundman's Andrée portrait in the semi-documentary novel, The Flight of the Eagle (1967), have speculated that Andrée had by this time become the prisoner of his own successful funding campaign. The sponsors and the media followed every delay and reported on every setback, and were clamoring for results. Andrée, Strindberg, and Ekholm had been seen off by cheering crowds in Stockholm and Gothenburg (see image from Aftonbladet, right), <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>all</b> the expectations were coming to nothing with the long wait for southerly winds at Danes Island. Especially pointed was the contrast between Nansen's simultaneous return, covered in polar glory from his daring yet well-planned expedition on the ship Fram, and Andrée's failure even to launch his own much-hyped conveyance. Sundman theorizes that Andrée could not face letting the press report {{that he did not know}} the prevailing wind direction, and had also miscalculated in ordering the balloon, and needed a new one to rectify his error.|$|E

2500|$|Olbermann has {{addressed}} the assertions of liberal bias {{by stating that}} he would be equally critical of a Democratic president who had invited criticism by his actions: [...] "I mean, no one in 1998, no one accused me of being a liberal in 1998 because I was covering the Lewinsky scandal. And whatever I had to do about it, I tried to be fair and honest and as accurate and as informed as possible, and allow my viewer to be the same way. And nowadays it's the same thing. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>all</b> of a sudden I’m a screaming liberal." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{few days}} before his death, in a final statement, he {{declared}} that nobody among either his associates or the general public had understood {{what had happened to}} him (as the conduit of the teaching). He added that the [...] "supreme intelligence" [...] operating in his body would be gone with his death, again implying the impossibility of successors. However, [...] he stated that people could perhaps get into touch with that somewhat [...] "if they live the teachings". In prior discussions, he had compared himself with Thomas Edison, implying that he did the hard work, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>all</b> that was needed by others was a flick of the switch.|$|E

2500|$|Pageboy {{activities}} include grilling on The Bridge, champagne at Millikan ("Bubbly") {{to celebrate the}} end of quarter, and Intrahouse, in which all eight alleys in Page partake in the annual tradition of applying primer and painting edgy, humorous pictures. [...] The painting in between alleys 6 and 7 covers [...] "the fruit wall", a favorite target for PVC-borne projectiles, particularly fruit which tend to vaporize on contact. [...] In addition to Intrahouse, there is the annual Stranding Of the Freshmen on Mt. Wilson, the Wait Staff Initiation, and the Greased Frosh Race, in which Pageboys make liberal use of Caltech's grounds and upkeep fund by selecting a designated freshman in each alley (referred to as that alley's Greased Frosh), who is then sent running on the Beckman lawn {{in the effort to}} evade upperclassmen who are trying to tackle an opposing alley's Greased Frosh before theirs is tackled. [...] Pageboys then rinse themselves in Gene Pool, producing a visible Crisco and lard film on the surface. [...] Until 2003, they first rinsed in Millikan Pond, but the location has changed owing to administrative request, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>all</b> the Pageboys rinse off completely in the Fleming showers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} {{track is}} the EDM song [...] "Break Free". The song combines the EDM and electro genres. In {{an interview with}} Billboard, Grande described the song as [...] "fantastic and super-experimental for [...] " [...] and stated: [...] "I never thought I'd do an EDM song, but that was an eye-opening experience, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>all</b> I {{want to do is}} dance." [...] The album's first of three ballads, [...] "Best Mistake", features Big Sean. Billboard described it as [...] "A moody ballad that grows stickier upon each listen, [...] "Best Mistake" [...] carries a tidy collection of impressive production details, the momentary string stabs among them". Musically, it is a minimal hip-hop piano ballad lament that utilizes instrumentation from strings and a drum machine. It tells a story about a couple trying to [...] "make up their minds about the future of their relationship, with deep affection buried underneath their problems." [...] "Be My Baby" [...] featuring Cashmere Cat is a [...] "bouncy R jam". The song was compared with Mariah Carey's songs. The eighth track, [...] "Break Your Heart Right Back", featuring Childish Gambino, is about her boyfriend cheating on her with a man and contains the lyrics [...] "I know you’re mad 'cause I found out / Want you to feel what I feel right now". The song interpolates Diana Ross's [...] "I'm Coming Out." ...|$|E
