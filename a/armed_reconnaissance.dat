5|$|In the afternoon, RAF Bomber Command {{abandoned}} {{more attacks}} on invasion ports because of insufficient cloud cover. Six Bristol Blenheims undertook an <b>armed</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> over the North Sea.

5|$|Subsequently, the Army {{decided to}} pursue {{development}} of another battlefield scout helicopter under the <b>Armed</b> <b>Reconnaissance</b> Helicopter program; this resulted in another rotorcraft, designated as the Bell ARH-70, being selected and developed with the intention to replace the OH-58D {{in place of the}} Comanche. However, during October 2008, it was announced that the ARH-70 also met with cancellation, reportedly due to cost overruns on its development.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{fighting}} {{broke out}} on the Plain of Jars as the members of each political grouping chose sides. Souvanna called upon the U.S. for support and was answered in the affirmative by President Lyndon B. Johnson, who was eager to support a rightist/neutralist alliance in Laos. In November 1963 General Maxwell D. Taylor, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had proposed that U.S. <b>armed</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> missions be conducted over Laos {{as part of a}} two phase program that would warn Hanoi of U.S. determination to support the Saigon government. The missions were to take place along North Vietnamese infiltration routes then developing in the Laotian panhandle.|$|E

5|$|On 12 December 1964, Barrel Roll was {{approved}} by Souvanna Phouma. The program originally consisted of only two U.S bombing sorties per week that were to be conducted {{by no more than}} four aircraft in each strike. Due {{to the nature of the}} American agreement with the Thai government (most U.S. strike aircraft flew from bases in Thailand), the aircraft had to first fly to South Vietnam, land, and then take off again for Laos. By 24 December, six <b>armed</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> missions were being conducted per day, but the hoped for reaction from Hanoi did not materialize.|$|E
5|$|This was {{virtually}} {{the only part}} of the Western Front, during the Phoney War, where there was significant aerial activity in the early months of the war, as RAF bombers flew unescorted raids on the German naval bases. So it did not take long for Specht to score his first victories: two Handley Page Hampden medium bombers in a squadron conducting an <b>armed</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> operation near Heligoland, shot down on 29 September. Needing a long-range fighter to better intercept the British bombers at distance, I./ZG 26 was thus the next Gruppe selected for re-equipping onto the Bf 110.|$|E
5|$|An <b>armed</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> by twelve Wellingtons on 14 December {{resulted}} in five being lost as the formation, {{at very low}} level because of the low cloud base, was heavily engaged by both fighter aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery. The RAF believed {{that none of the}} lost Wellingtons had been shot down by fighters, however, and so maintained faith in their defensive capabilities when flown in tight formations. This summation was odd considering the evidence available. The Luftwaffe claimed five bombers for the loss of one fighter while none of the German FlaK units claimed a victory. Several of the returning RAF bombers clearly had small arms damage from machine gun rounds, making the summation of the RAF that FlaK did the damage highly suspect.|$|E

5|$|The McDonnell Douglas (now Boeing) AV-8B Harrier II is a {{single-engine}} ground-attack {{aircraft that}} constitutes {{the second generation}} of the Harrier Jump Jet family. Capable of vertical or short takeoff and landing (V/STOL), the aircraft was designed in the late 1970s as an Anglo-American development of the British Hawker Siddeley Harrier, the first operational V/STOL aircraft. Named after a bird of prey, it is primarily employed on light attack or multi-role missions, ranging from close air support of ground troops to <b>armed</b> <b>reconnaissance.</b> The AV-8B {{is used by the}} United States Marine Corps (USMC), the Spanish Navy, and the Italian Navy. A variant of the AV-8B, the British Aerospace Harrier II, was developed for the British military, while another, the TAV-8B, is a dedicated two-seat trainer.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of Igloo White/Commando Hunt, the aerial interdiction effort entered a new phase. <b>Armed</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> – the patrolling of known {{segments}} of the trail system by aircraft searching for targets of opportunity – gave way to strikes directed by the sensor system. That {{is not to say}} the Task Force Alpha had operational control of the aircraft that carried out the missions. The Seventh Air Force was not about to surrender the single air manager control that it had just fought so hard to obtain. Task Force Alpha supported the Seventh by gathering, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence. This intelligence was delivered from Nakhon Phanom to the Seventh's headquarters at Ton Son Nhut Air Base, where it issued the strike orders. The ABCCCs were also {{under the control of the}} Seventh, not Task Force Alpha.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong {{first saw}} {{action in the}} Korean War on August 29, 1951, as an escort for a photo {{reconnaissance}} plane over Songjin. Five days later on September 3, he flew <b>armed</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> over the primary transportation and storage facilities south of the village of Majon-ni, west of Wonsan. While making a low bombing run at about , Armstrong's F9F Panther was hit by anti-aircraft fire. While trying to regain control, he collided with a pole at a height of about , which sliced off about three feet (1 m) of the Panther's right wing. Armstrong flew the plane back to friendly territory, but due {{to the loss of}} the aileron, ejection was his only safe option. He planned to eject over water and await rescue by Navy helicopters, and therefore flew to an airfield near Pohang, but his ejection seat was blown back over land. A jeep driven by a roommate from flight school picked Armstrong up; it is unknown what happened to the wreckage of No. 125122 F9F-2.|$|E

5|$|Coastal Command {{had begun}} {{scouting}} for German shipping near the Dutch coast in spring 1940. Squadrons were working {{up on the}} Blenheim IV fighters at the time. However their preparation was short-lived. The German assault on Western Europe on 10 May 1940 changed the tempo of events. On 11 May, No. 235 Squadron RAF was used to cover the landing of small British Army units near The Hague. Shortly after its capture, No. 22 Squadron RAF dropped ten 500lb bombs on Waalhaven airport, Rotterdam. No. 206 Squadron conducted <b>armed</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> along the Dutch coast and after permission was received, No. 220 and 233 Squadrons bombed oil storage tanks at Hamburg and Bremen on 18 May. Five Beauforts made similar attacks on Rotterdam on 29 May, which caused extensive fires. The same day, No. 22 Squadron made the first daylight anti-shipping attack on E-boats in IJmuiden harbour. No. 40 and No. 500 Squadron conducted {{the same kind of}} strikes.|$|E
5|$|On 11 August 2014, a Cabinet Office Briefing Room (COBR) {{emergency}} meeting {{concluded that the}} RAF would deploy Tornado GR4s to RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus in support of refugees sheltering from Islamic State militants in the Mount Sinjar region of Iraq. The decision came {{three days after the}} United States began conducting air attacks against the Islamic State. Tornados were pre-positioned to use their surveillance capabilities to gather situational awareness to help with humanitarian efforts. On 29 September 2014, three days after Parliament approved of airstrikes against Islamic State forces inside Iraq, two Tornados conducted their first <b>armed</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> mission over the country, in conjunction with other coalition aircraft, and were cleared to conduct airstrikes if needed. Britain's first airstrike was conducted the next day, when two Tornados hit a heavy weapons post and an armored vehicle in the process of supporting Kurdish forces in northwest Iraq. By 1 March 2015, eight RAF Tornados had been deployed to Akrotiri and conducted 159 airstrikes against IS targets in Iraq.|$|E
5|$|The AV-8B {{underwent}} standard evaluation {{to prepare}} for its USMC service. In the operational evaluation (OPEVAL), lasting from 31 August 1984 to 30 March 1985, four pilots {{and a group of}} maintenance and support personnel tested the aircraft under combat conditions. The aircraft was graded for its ability to meet its mission requirements for navigating, acquiring targets, delivering weapons, and evading and surviving enemy actions, all at the specified range and payload limits. The first phase of OPEVAL, running until 1 February 1985, required the AV-8B to fly both deep and close air support missions (deep air support missions do not require coordination with friendly ground forces) in concert with other close-support aircraft, as well as flying battlefield interdiction and <b>armed</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> missions. The aircraft flew from military installations at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton and Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in California, Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake in Canada, and MCAS Yuma in Arizona.|$|E

5000|$|When the {{battalion}} was formed it absorbed the three companies; a Headquarters and Service Company, Company D, and Company E (a Scout and Sniper Company). Company E (Scouts) was a combined <b>arms</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> (CAR) unit that had three scout platoons. They were formed {{from a group}} of reassigned reconnaissance scouts from the Scout and Sniper companies within the 3rd Marine Division. [...] They became the forerunner of the Marine Division Reconnaissance assets used by the Marine divisions today. [...] For greater mobility and firepower, the division commander equipped his scout company with light tanks to reinforce his regimental infantry units; especially useful for reconnaissance in force (RIF) tasks.

5|$|Two more combat {{versions}} of the PanzerI were designed and produced between 1939 and 1942. By this stage, the design concept had been superseded by medium and heavy tanks and neither variant was produced in sufficient numbers {{to have a real}} impact on the progress of the war. These new tanks had nothing in common with either the Ausf.A or B except name. One of these, the Panzer I Ausf.C, was designed jointly between Krauss-Maffei and Daimler-Benz in 1939 to provide an amply armoured and <b>armed</b> <b>reconnaissance</b> light tank. The Ausf.C boasted a completely new chassis and turret, a modern torsion-bar suspension and five Schachtellaufwerk-style interleaved roadwheels. It also had a maximum armor thickness of 30millimeters (1.18in), over twice that of either the Ausf.A or B, and was armed with an EW 141 semi autocannon, with a 50-round drum, firing 7.92mm anti-tank shells. Forty of these tanks were produced, along with six prototypes. Two tanks were deployed to 1st Panzer Division in 1943, and the other thirty-eight were deployed to the LVIII Panzer Reserve Corps during the Normandy landings.|$|E
5|$|For 11 {{hours the}} German fleet sailed from Brest into the English Channel to the Dover Straits. By chance, a {{mechanic}} {{on the radar}} station at Fairlight, East Sussex had just finished repairing the equipment when he picked up 27 echos at 10:15 on 12 February, south of Cap Gris Nez. The information was relayed to Vice-Admiral Bertram Ramsay, who ordered his Air Officer liaison to contact No. 11 Group RAF to ask for <b>armed</b> <b>reconnaissance.</b> Ramsay also warned No. 16 Group RAF and the FAA squadron operating out of RAF Manston that there were possible targets were in the Channel, despite not knowing the exact number or size of the enemy vessels. The performance of the radar was down to the jamming of the sets (Ballstöranlage) by two Heinkel He 111s which had been flying off the south coast from their airfield near Paris. The flights ceased at 09:00 when installations along the French coast had taken over. The detection by Fairlight {{was a piece of}} good fortune, the Germans had assumed it to be out of action. Ten Dornier Do 217s from III./KG 2 flew missions against Plymouth harbour and airfield, while 15 flew diversion missions to keep RAF fighters clear of the He 111s.|$|E
