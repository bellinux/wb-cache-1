5|$|Another {{proposed}} spacecraft, the Gemini Lunar Surface Survival Shelter, {{was designed}} to be sent to the Moon ahead of an <b>Apollo</b> <b>mission.</b> It would have landed close to the planned Apollo landing site, and if the Apollo Lunar Module's ascent stage failed to ignite, the crew would have performed an EVA to transfer to the LSSS. The shelter was not designed to take off again after landing, so an LSRS or another <b>Apollo</b> <b>mission</b> would then be sent to collect the crew, whilst the Command Module Pilot of the original <b>Apollo</b> <b>mission</b> would have returned to Earth alone aboard his spacecraft. It consisted of a Gemini Reentry Module, which would have housed the astronauts whilst they awaited rescue, and a descent stage containing life support systems, consumables, and the engine and propellant used to land the spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the risks}} {{associated}} with the Lunar landing, a number of rescue spacecraft were proposed, to be used to allow the crew of an <b>Apollo</b> <b>mission</b> to return to Earth safely {{in the event of a}} problem. Many of these designs were based around the Gemini spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, ILC {{was sold}} to Stanley Warner Corporation for $15 million($ in modern dollars). The {{following}} year, {{it was the first}} to advertise under-garments on network television. In 1962, the industrial division of Playtex was awarded a contract to develop space suits for the <b>Apollo</b> <b>mission</b> to the moon. Two years prior to the 1969 moon landing that used its latex suits, Playtex's industrial division was spun off, eventually becoming ILC Dover.|$|E
5|$|In March, NASA was {{studying}} {{the possibility of}} flying the first <b>Apollo</b> <b>mission</b> as a joint space rendezvous with the final Project Gemini mission, Gemini 12 in November 1966. But by May, delays in making Apollo ready for flight just by itself, and the extra time needed to incorporate compatibility with the Gemini, made that impractical. This became moot when slippage in readiness of the AS-204 spacecraft caused the last-quarter 1966 target date to be missed, and the mission was rescheduled for February 21, 1967.|$|E
5|$|Manned Apollo {{flights were}} {{suspended}} for 20 months while the Command Module's hazards were addressed. However, {{the development and}} unmanned testing of the Lunar Module (LM) and Saturn V Moon rocket continued.

The first successful manned <b>Apollo</b> <b>mission</b> was flown by Apollo 1's backup crew on Apollo 7 in October 1968.|$|E

5|$|To save cost, NASA {{used one}} of the Saturn V rockets {{originally}} earmarked for a canceled <b>Apollo</b> <b>mission</b> to launch the Skylab.

5|$|With the {{beginning}} of the Apollo program, Kraft expected to return to his role in Mission Control. He would have been lead flight director on the first manned <b>Apollo</b> <b>mission</b> (later known as Apollo 1), which was scheduled to launch in early 1967. However, on January 27, 1967, the three crew members were killed in a fire during a countdown test on the pad. At the time of the fire, Kraft was in Mission Control, but under the circumstances there was little he could do. He was asked by Betty Grissom, the widow of astronaut Gus Grissom, {{to be one of the}} pallbearers at Grissom's funeral at Arlington National Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The Apollo {{program has}} been called the {{greatest}} technological achievement in human history. Apollo stimulated many areas of technology, leading to over 1,800 spinoff products as of 2015. The flight computer design used in both the Lunar and Command Modules was, along with the Polaris and Minuteman missile systems, the driving force behind early research into integrated circuits (IC). By 1963, Apollo was using 60 percent of the United States' production of ICs. The crucial difference between the requirements of Apollo and the missile programs was Apollo's much greater need for reliability. While the Navy and Air Force could work around reliability problems by deploying more missiles, the political and financial cost of failure of an <b>Apollo</b> <b>mission</b> was unacceptably high.|$|E

5|$|Schirra gave {{a public}} lecture at Rice University after {{returning}} to Houston, where he received a motorcade through the city. However, the Cuban Missile Crisis had been steadily escalating through September, and helped drive discussion of Schirra's successful flight down the news schedules; public concern about the relative effectiveness of Soviet and American space launchers was displaced by a more pressing concern over Soviet military rockets. He visited Washington, D.C., to receive the NASA Distinguished Service Medal from President Kennedy on October 16, the same day Kennedy had first seen U-2 photographs of missile sites in Cuba; the meeting was friendly and informal despite the circumstances. Robert Kennedy, Schirra later noted, took him aside and sounded him out about a potential political career, {{the same way he}} had sounded out John Glenn a year earlier. Unlike Glenn, however, Schirra politely turned the suggestion down, and chose to remain with NASA. His later career saw him commanding the backup crew for the first Gemini mission, then the prime crew for the 1965 Gemini 6A mission, where he flew the first active rendezvous between two spacecraft - earlier plans for it to conduct the first on-orbit docking had been cancelled - and finally commanding the first <b>Apollo</b> <b>mission,</b> Apollo 7, in 1968. He retired from NASA in the summer of 1969, the only astronaut to fly on Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo.|$|E

25|$|Gemini's {{objective}} was {{the development of}} space travel techniques to support the <b>Apollo</b> <b>mission</b> to land astronauts on the Moon. It performed missions long enough {{for a trip to}} the Moon and back, perfected working outside the spacecraft with extra-vehicular activity (EVA), and pioneered the orbital maneuvers necessary to achieve space rendezvous and docking. With these new techniques proven by Gemini, Apollo could pursue its prime mission without doing these fundamental exploratory operations.|$|E
