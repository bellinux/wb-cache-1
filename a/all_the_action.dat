5|$|Wild Arms is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} {{that involves the}} player controlling up to three characters, Rudy, Jack, and Cecilia, as they progress {{through a number of}} environments, battle enemies, and solve puzzles. The game is presented in a top-down two-dimensional fashion where the player has an overhead view of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> taking place on a particular screen. To advance, the player must overcome a number of story-based scenarios and sequences that involve navigating through dungeons while fighting enemies that appear randomly. Characters progress and grow by gaining experience points after a battle, discovering crest graphs, finding ARMs, and mastering sword techniques prompted by various events in the game. This allows them to battle increasingly more difficult demonic entities.|$|E
5|$|With {{its ranks}} {{replenished}} after the winter actions, the six-regiment division under Nansouty numbered, on 1 June 1807, {{no less than}} 3,257 men. It {{was by far the}} most powerful heavy cavalry division of the Cavalry Reserve, which then included two other such divisions, the 2nd under Saint-Sulpice and a newly added 3rd, under Espagne. As military operation resumed later in 1807, Nasouty's division was hastily directed towards the town of Deppen, where Marshal Michel Ney had managed to retreat with his Corps, after energetically extricating himself from a dangerous situation, with surprisingly few losses. With Ney's Corps, the Cavalry Reserve and the Guard, Napoleon moved towards Guttstadt, where on 9 June he found a large combined-arms enemy force. Murat took Lasalle's light horse and Nansouty's heavy cavalry and launched a series of charges that drove back the enemy force. Murat continued to press on and pushed the enemy into the streets of Guttstadt, where he penetrated with the cavalry at nightfall. Having fought well with his men, Nansouty was rested the next day, leaving <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> at the Battle of Heilsberg to Espagne's 3rd Heavy Cavalry division.|$|E

25|$|From the beginning, Universal {{had offered}} tours of its studio.

There was also a chance to buy fresh produce, since then-rural Universal City was still in part a working farm.

25|$|In the Rhineland, May 1 is also {{celebrated by}} the {{delivery}} of a maypole, a tree covered in streamers {{to the house of}} a girl the night before.

Bradley and Spielberg used previsualization for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> scenes, except the motorcycle chase at Marshall College, because that idea was conceived after the animators had left. Bradley drew traditional storyboards instead, and was given free rein to create dramatic moments, just as Raiders of the Lost Ark second unit director Michael D. Moore did when filming the truck chase. Spielberg improvised on set, changing the location of Mutt and Spalko's duel from the ground to on top of vehicles.|$|E

500|$|Writer, director, and series creator Chris Carter based {{the episode}} around an idea he and fellow writer Frank Spotnitz {{had been working}} on, {{featuring}} a haunted house. The only scene that the two had completely planned out was the climax, which features Mulder and Scully pulling themselves across the floor, bleeding profusely. Carter wanted to keep <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> on one set, with the episode featuring only one location. To do this, production designer Corey Kaplan proposed that the episode be filmed in Scully's apartment, a set that the crew had not used for season six. Carter, however, wanting to keep the haunted house motif, asked Kaplan if she could design a mansion set. Kaplan was tasked with designing a set that was [...] "bleak, but not too bleak [...] decrepit, but not too decrepit," [...] and [...] "deserted, but not too deserted." ...|$|E

They had this dark past and this intense hatred of witches. So as I thought about it, it made sense to me that of course they would be fated to become great witch hunters. We wanted it to feel like this could be happening 300 years ago but at the same time, there is a modern spin on <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>action,</b> characters and weaponry. It was a fun way to make a classical world feel fresh." [...] Wirkola said that he originally came with that idea in 2007 while studying film and television at Bond University in Australia, when he wanted to make it as just a short film, and that the film school director Simon Hunter advised him: [...] "Tom, don't ever speak of the idea again until you are in front of a Hollywood producer and I guarantee you will sell it." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{overwhelming}} negative reviews, the film did receive some positive feedback.

Since his original review, Ebert claimed that he enjoyed Speed2 more than Bullock, and wrote an article in 2013 that his favorable review of the film [...] "inspired more disbelief" [...] than any other he had written and was frequently cited as an example of him being a poor film critic. At the Conference on World Affairs in 1999, Ebert spoke about the difficulty of making films such as Speed2 and defended his review by offering a [...] "Speed3" [...] contest for anyone to create a five-minute short film that takes place on something that cannot stop moving.|$|E

500|$|The Milan premiere at La Scala {{took place}} under Toscanini on 17March 1900. Darclée and Giraldoni reprised their roles; the {{prominent}} tenor Giuseppe Borgatti replaced De Marchi as Cavaradossi. The opera {{was a great}} success at La Scala, and played to full houses. Puccini travelled to London for the British premiere at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, on 12July, with Milka Ternina and Fernando De Lucia as the doomed lovers and Antonio Scotti as Scarpia. Puccini wrote that Tosca was [...] " [...] complete triumph", and Ricordi's London representative quickly signed a contract to take Tosca to New York. The premiere at the Metropolitan Opera was on 4February 1901, with De Lucia's replacement by Giuseppe Cremonini the only change from the London cast. For its French premiere at the Opéra-Comique on 13October 1903, the 72-year-old Sardou took charge of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> on the stage. Puccini was delighted with the public's reception {{of the work in}} Paris, despite adverse comments from critics. The opera was subsequently premiered at venues throughout Europe, the Americas, Australia and the Far East; by the outbreak of war in 1914 it had been performed in more than 50 cities worldwide.|$|E

When he was hired to direct the film, Pakula only offered the role to Harrison Ford, believing that the actor possessed an [...] "Everyman quality" [...] that best suited the character. [...] Ford's casting was confirmed in March 1989. He received a $7 million salary for the role. Turow was initially uncertain of Ford portraying Rusty but relented after seeing {{a few of the}} actor's films. Ford said, [...] "Friends warned me this was a tough role because Rusty is such a passive, interior character. Though Rusty's in every scene, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> takes place around him. Things happen to him." [...] Upon being cast, Ford read the novel to avoid arguments over events and details that were left out in the book. Ford also suggested to Pakula that Rusty have a buzz cut. He explained, [...] "There are many things I found I could express with that short haircut. Simplest of all, I wanted to tell the audience to leave their baggage at home — not to expect the Harrison Ford they've seen before." ...|$|E

[...] Kristin dos Santos of E! praised the chemistry between Naveen Andrews and Andrea Gabriel, who play Sayid and Nadia, respectively. [...] Chris Carabott of IGN gave Part 1 of the three-hour finale a 7.9. [...] He commended the music and called it [...] "a good opening to what should be an exciting season finale"; however, the lack of suspense in favor of set-up was cited as the reason for the modest rating. However, Carabott gave Parts 2 & 3 a perfect 10 review, tying with other perfect-10 episodes such as [...] "The Constant" [...] and [...] "Through the Looking Glass". He stated that [...] "Not a moment is wasted in this brilliantly paced and well-executed conclusion to what has been a fantastic season." [...] Dan Compora of SyFy Portal called [...] "Part 1" [...] "an excellent setup episode [...] fast pace, important revelations, and nearly a full utilization of the cast". [...] Compora decided that [...] "certain characters work much better in very small doses … a little bit of [...] goes a long way [...] it was nice to see Jack featured without completely dominating an episode." [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV summed up Part 1 as [...] "very good", but said that the opening flashforward in which the Oceanic Six are reunited with their families was anticlimactic and [...] "although each flashforward scene had minor and major revelations, it felt patched together and a little sloppy, like Lindelof and Cuse had all this ground to cover in their quest to link <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> up to the final scene of season 3 … That said, the flashforward scenes all played out exceedingly well." [...] Daniel of TMZ welcomed the return of Richard (on the island) and gave the episode an [...] "A", saying that it had [...] "more than a few fantastic scenes.

Kim Possible is ready and able to rescue humankind from evildoers without sacrificing her interest in boys and clothes." [...] However, in her book Girlfighting: Betrayal and Rejection, author Lyn Mikel Brown dismissed Kim as both a feminist and role model because of her alleged reliance on Ron's intelligence, as well as the observation that [...] "Her biggest threat is not evil, in fact, but the head cheerleader".
