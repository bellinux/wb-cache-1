5|$|Aboriginal Tasmanians {{have lived}} {{on the island of}} Tasmania for {{thousands}} of years. The earliest archaeological evidence for Aboriginal habitation of Tasmania is from the valley of the Forth River, 35,000 years before the present. Prior to European settlement, Chudleigh was part of the lands of the Pallittorre Aboriginal tribe. Their range included Deloraine, east of Chudleigh, and the Gog mountain range to the north-west where they mined ochre in the Toolumbunner ochre pits. The Pallittorre people lived in the area and used to have <b>a</b> <b>camping</b> ground, where the Church of England cemetery was established later. Land clearing, road construction, disease and conflicts with settlers drove them from their lands and decimated the population. Their population in the area has been estimated to drop from 200 to 60 during 1827-30. At the time of settlement the Chudleigh area was covered with bogs and wild bush.|$|E
5|$|Development for Firewatch {{began with}} a single {{painting}} by Moss.

In creating the painting, Moss emulated National Park Service posters from the New Deal era in both color palette and iconography. The development team went on <b>a</b> <b>camping</b> trip to Yosemite National Park for inspiration for the game, where they visited a lookout tower built with the same design as its video game counterpart. Further inspiration for the game came from Vanaman and Anderson's experiences growing up in rural Wyoming.|$|E
