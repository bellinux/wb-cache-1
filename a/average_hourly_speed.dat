40|$|Several past {{studies have}} {{attempted}} to quantify the impact of winter weather conditions on highway mobility in terms of traffic volume, speed, and capacity. While consistent in their general findings, these studies have shown considerably different results in terms of effect size and contributing factors. More importantly, most of these studies have not attempted to model the effects of winter maintenance operations on mobility or isolate these effects from those due to snowstorm characteristics, rendering their results and the proposed methods of limited use for estimating the benefits of maintenance activities. This research attempts to address this gap through a statistical analysis of a data set that is unique in terms of spatial and temporal coverage and data completeness. The data set includes both event based and hourly observations of road weather and surface conditions, maintenance operations, traffic volume and speed, {{as well as several}} other measures, from 21 highway sections across the province of Ontario. Event based information is available for six winter seasons (2000 to 2006) at 19 of the sites. For this event based data a matched pair technique was employed to determine the changes in traffic volumes and speeds under matched conditions with and without snow events. A regression analysis was subsequently performed to relate the changes in traffic volume and speed over an event to changes in various contributing factors such as highway type, snow event characteristics and road surface conditions. A case study was conducted to illustrate the application of the developed models for quantifying the mobility impact of road surface condition and the mobility benefit of winter maintenance operations. Complete hourly records were available for all 21 sites for three winter seasons. This was used to perform the evaluation on an hourly basis. A matching technique is employed to assign hour-by-hour median speeds observed under typical weather and road surface conditions to each hour of a snowstorm event. A regression analysis is subsequently performed to relate changes from <b>average</b> <b>hourly</b> <b>speed</b> to various contributing factors such as highway type, weather conditions and maintenance operations. Effects of maintenance operations are represented by an intermediate variable called road surface condition index (RSI). A case study is conducted to illustrate the application of the developed models for quantifying the mobility impact of winter snowstorms and the mobility benefit of maintenance operations. The models developed in these analyses confirmed the relationships between weather variables and traffic volume and speed described in the literature. In addition a strong association between road surface condition and traffic volumes and speed was identified...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{efficiency}} of PV modules decreases with increasing module temperatures. Many studies have paid attention to the development and validation of heuristic models to calculate the PV module temperature in higher latitudes, however only a few focus on the thermal behaviour of PV modules in tropical regions of the world, where constantly high temperatures prevail.

This study evaluates three of such models - one that excludes wind, and two others including the wind influence - using hourly data for two tropical locations. Results show that the <b>average</b> <b>hourly</b> wind <b>speeds</b> in Singapore and Jayapura (Indonesia) are low and therefore the influence of the wind on the PV module temperature is minor.

40|$|Abstract: The {{introduction}} of a large quantity of wind generators on the Portuguese electric grid, will produce the effect of having {{a large percentage of}} installed power whose production is not controllable. The consequence is a major difficulty to the grid operator in dealing with power availability and oscillations in the frequency. There is the urgent need of a reliable tool for estimating the expected value of the daily power produced by the wind generators in order to elaborate hourly and daily forwarding-dispatches [2] and [3]. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are being used as a model able to predict the <b>average</b> <b>hourly</b> wind <b>speed.</b> However most of the work applying neural networks to wind speed prediction uses Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) or the recurrent version of them [4],[5],[6] and [7].

40|$|Running Stabilized Emissions from vehicle {{exhausts}} {{are estimated}} by combining travel activity quantified as vehicle miles of travel (VMT) or vehicle hours of travel (VHT) with emissions factors which are adjusted for speeds on facility links. These speeds {{which are used}} for adjusting emissions factors are averaged for fixed periods (typically for one hour intervals) and across the lanes of multi-lane links. In real world traffic conditions, however, average speeds are variable for higher time resolutions and across lanes. Incorporating the variability in average speeds during calculation will result in different magnitudes of estimated running stabilized emissions for a given {{period of time and}} a facility link. Lane volume and occupancy measurements from 1376 single loop detector stations on 830 freeway links in Los Angeles were used to estimate flow rates, <b>hourly</b> <b>average</b> link <b>speeds,</b> 15 -minute <b>average</b> link <b>speeds</b> and <b>hourly</b> <b>average</b> lane <b>speeds.</b> Then, these flow rates and average speeds were used to estimate hourly link CO, CO 2, NOx, PMx and TOG emissions and hourly gridded emissions based on different average speed resolutions for the summer of 1997. This study statistically examines the hourly differences in running stabilized emissions when 15 -minute link and <b>hourly</b> lane <b>average</b> <b>speeds</b> are used in contrast to <b>hourly</b> link <b>average</b> <b>speeds</b> for running stabilized emissions estimation. Moreover, effects of speed variability on regional air quality are evaluated by examining the differences in estimated gridded ozone (O 3) and fine particulate matter (PM 25) concentrations based on different gridded emissions inventories (estimated using hourly link, 15 -minute link and <b>hourly</b> lane <b>average</b> <b>speeds).</b> The results show that the magnitudes of estimated hourly link running stabilized emissions are different especially when <b>hourly</b> lane <b>average</b> <b>speeds</b> are used in contrast to the <b>hourly</b> link <b>average</b> <b>speeds.</b> Estimated O 3 and PM 25 concentrations also differ, however, the differences in these estimated secondary pollutant concentrations show different patterns when compared to the differences in estimated emissions...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{short-term}} {{wind speed}} forecasting {{is needed for}} the rapid development and efficient operation of wind energy resources. This is, however, a very challenging problem. Although on the large scale, the wind speed is related to atmospheric pressure, temperature, and other meteorological variables, no improvement in forecasting accuracy was found by incorporating air pressure and temperature directly into an advanced space-time statistical forecasting model, the trigonometric direction diurnal (TDD) model. This paper proposes to incorporate the geostrophic wind as a new predictor in the TDD model. The geostrophic wind captures the physical relationship between wind and pressure through the observed approximate balance between the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis acceleration due to the Earth’s rotation. Based on our numerical experiments with data from West Texas, our new method produces more accurate forecasts than does the TDD model using air pressure and temperature for 1 to 6 -hour-ahead forecasts based on three different evaluation criteria. Furthermore, forecasting errors can be further reduced by using moving <b>average</b> <b>hourly</b> wind <b>speeds</b> to fit the diurnal pattern. For example, our new method obtains between 13. 9 % and 22. 4 % overall mean absolute error reduction relative to persistence in 2 -hour-ahead forecasts, and between 5. 3 % and 8. 2 % reduction relative to the best previous space-time methods in this setting...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMost recent {{research}} and monitoring of under-water “soundscapes” {{has focused on}} marine systems in open water conditions. Here we present the first long-term assessment of the diel and seasonal patterns of a fresh-water aquatic soundscape under-ice cover. Acoustic data recorded in Yellowknife Bay, Great Slave Lake in Canada's Northwest Territories, measured the under-ice soundscape near an ice road and airport. From December to late January, the soundscape consisted of geophony from ice cracking and anthrophony from snowmobiles, aircraft, and road vehicles. In late January, burbot spawning calls began and added a localized biophony source to the soundscape that increased the total sound pressure level due {{to an increase in}} sound levels in the 10 – 425 Hz frequency band. The median 1 min root-mean-square sound pressure level (rms SPL) in the period without burbot biophony was 90. 3 dB re 1 μPa. The measured hourly rms SPL was negatively correlated with air temperature in the 200 – 800 Hz band but positively correlated with <b>average</b> <b>hourly</b> wind <b>speed</b> in the 800 – 8000 Hz band. The nightly mean rms SPL was 88 dB re 1 μPa and increased to 96 dB re 1 μPa in late afternoon.

Further work is recommended to quantify the soundscape in deep-water areas of large lakes and to include particle motion.
