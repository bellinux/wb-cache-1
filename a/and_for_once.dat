25|$|In late 1985, Falsk and Mathisen {{resumed their}} partnership, and {{released}} the video Sammen er vi som et hardkokt egg, which contained {{a series of}} new sketches, and later the same year the duo released the album Viggo & Reidar synger julen inn (Jul i containeren), a parody of Christmas albums. In October 1986, Falsk and Mathisen returned to the theatre for their first show since the Prima Vera breakup, called Fusk, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>once</b> they received mostly positive reviews. In 1987, Falsk and Mathisen released the album Hubaluba, which {{was followed by a}} tour in 1988. Shortly before Christmas, they also released the album Tidligere utgitt på alvor (Previously released seriously), where they performed mock versions of previously released songs by mainstream artists like Arne Bendiksen, Rune Rudberg, and their former bandmate Jahn Teigen.|$|E

25|$|Earlier in 1846 Beverly {{had been}} engaged by John Medex Maddox as {{principal}} artist at the Princess's Theatre, London. In July the scenery for {{the revival of}} James Robinson Planché's Sleeping Beauty was from his brush, as were the backgrounds in the Christmas pantomime The Enchanted Beauties of the Golden Castle. In Easter 1847 he provided ingenious transformations for a revival of A Midsummer Night's Dream. While still continuing his association with the Princess's, Beverly worked for the Lyceum Theatre under Lucia Elizabeth Vestris and Charles James Mathews (1847–55), where Planché compared him with the stage mechanician William Bradwell. His outstanding success was in The Island of Jewels of December 1849, when building {{on the work of}} Bradwell, he pioneered the transformation scene. His scenery at the Lyceum for Planché's Good Woman in a Wood (Christmas 1852), <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>Once</b> upon a time there were two Kings (Christmas 1853), was praised by G. H. Lewes and Henry Morley.|$|E
25|$|Back in England in 1965, Smith beat a weak New Zealand 3–0, {{then lost}} 1–0 to South Africa, but was {{appointed}} captain for the MCC tour of Australia in 1965-66 with Cowdrey as vice-captain, despite {{support for the}} Kent captain at Lord's. Although the press labelled the England team as the weakest to go to Australia, their entertaining cricket won them favour with the crowds. They also made their runs faster than any other England team since the war <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>once</b> England batted faster than Australia, a refreshing contrast to other Ashes series of the era. The tourists had had the best run of games of any MCC team since the war, beating Western Australia, South Australia and New South Wales, drawing with Queensland, when they needed two more wickets to win, and losing to Victoria by 32 runs after an exciting run-chase. As a result, the bookies reduced the odds of their winning the Ashes from 7/2 to evens. England survived the follow on in the First Test and made 558 in the Second, both drawn. At Sydney in the Third Test England rattled up 488 and won by an innings and 93 runs {{to give them a}} 1–0 lead in the series. It was Australia's biggest defeat at home for nearly 50 years, but they fought back to win the Fourth Test by an innings and retained the Ashes. Rain ruined play in New Zealand and the three Test series was drawn 0–0 despite the home team suffering {{at the hands of the}} England bowlers. On his return to England Smith was dropped after losing the First Test against the West Indies in 1966 by an innings. He was replaced by Cowdrey and retired at the end of the following season.|$|E

After comparing the two games, Whyld writes, [...] "The verdict seems clear. Gossip was robbed!"

500|$|Elisabeth Mahoney from The Guardian {{observed}} that Ruth and David's marriage imploded while Sophie was around {{and she said}} {{the speed at which}} it happened made for genuinely shocking listening. Mahoney said [...] "Felicity Finch and Tim Bentinck spat their toxic lines out with much relish, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>once</b> emphatically shook off their characters' middle-of-the-road cosiness and golden couple status." [...] After seeking Sam out for comfort, Ruth kissed him. When Sam declared his love for Ruth, she agreed to spend the night with him at a hotel in Oxford. Ruth told David she was meeting an friend for the night. Tim Teeman from The Times commented that the moment Ruth became stuck in traffic contrasted with [...] "the scary new land she was travelling towards". Ruth's decision to spend the night with Sam was the focus of The Archers 15,000th episode, which was broadcast on 7 November 2006. The episode was written by Joanna Toye, who told Emily Lambert of the Western Mail that the traffic jam was used to increase the tension.|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{reception}} {{ranged from}} positive to mixed. Critic Maureen Ryan was very {{positive about the}} episode in her blog at The Chicago Tribune, writing, [...] "I liked this week's episode, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>once,</b> it wasn't a case of really wanting to like it {{and trying to find}} reasons to see past various flaws. I just enjoyed the hour and felt it had just the right mixture of creepiness and character development (plus, the Observer was awesome. If only they'd called him the Watcher, but let's not quibble)." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger found [...] "The Arrival" [...] a noticeable improvement over previous episodes. [...] "...After being more than prepared to give [...] "Fringe That's It For Me! status going into the episode, I enjoyed the strangeness of it—The Observer's hairlessness and diet, Capt. Patterson from [...] "Generation Kill" [...] toting around a futuristic-looking ray gun and a retro-looking mind-reading machine, Walter casually injecting whatsername with a sedative—that I think I'll be sticking around for a bit... If I can brace myself for the probability that this will all lead to nonsense, I can groove on all the atmospherics along the way. And, if nothing else, Abrams is great at atmosphere." ...|$|E
500|$|Cyrus {{performed}} [...] "I Miss You" [...] as {{an encore}} on sporadic dates {{of her first}} headlining tour, the Best of Both Worlds Tour, which extended from October 2007 to January 2008. The tour's [...] uses the performance within the set, {{although it was not}} performed as such. The performance had Cyrus dressed in a white tank top, blue cardigan, and denim pants, and sole on the stage. She sat on a stool that placed {{towards the end of the}} runaway, performing with an acoustic guitar, as images and home footage of Ron Cyrus appeared on the screens. Chris William of Entertainment Weekly attended the November 8, 2007 concert at the San Diego Sports Arena in San Diego, California, and wrote, [...] "So it was especially sweet when, for the encore, she ditched the dancers and enhancers and strummed an acoustic guitar on 'I Miss You,' vulnerably serenading her late grandpappy — <b>and,</b> <b>for</b> <b>once,</b> really looking and sounding 14. Not everyone noticed because, when she finished, half the seats were empty." [...] Alison Bonaguro Dressed of the Chicago Tribune stated that, despite its simplicity, the performance on December 8, 2007 at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont, Illinois felt like as though it was the largest production of all. In a gray shirt and black pants, Cyrus performed the song, along with [...] "Ready, Set, Don't Go" [...] and [...] "The Best of Both Worlds", on The Oprah Winfrey Show on December 20, 2007, as a screen displayed a light-blue background. i recreated hannah montana ...|$|E

500|$|Upon release, {{the album}} was well {{received}} by reviewers. Sounds gave Join Hands a grade of 4.5 out of 5, with the reviewer, Pete Silverton, noting {{a change in the}} sound: [...] "The mix is different to the last album. Now there's a clarity which frames Sue's voice like it was a thing of treasure". Silverton also wrote that some of the songs have [...] "Siouxsie's voice double-tracked with devastating effect". Jon Savage, a Melody Maker reviewer, described the first track, [...] "Poppy Day", as a [...] "short, powerful evocation of the Great War graveyards in Flanders". He also wrote that [...] "Placebo Effect" [...] "has a stunning flanged guitar intro, chasing clinical lyrics covering some insertion or operation". About [...] "Icon", Savage wrote: [...] "The brilliantly reverbed guitar is a perfect foil for Siouxsie's soaring <b>and,</b> <b>for</b> <b>once,</b> emotional vocal." [...] Savage noted that the five songs of the first side [...] "rise and fall into another in a stunning segue". Similarly, Paul Morley [...] wrote in NME that [...] "Side one's five songs [...] are all addictive Banshees mini-dramas". Ronnie Gurr, a Record Mirror reviewer, also hailed the record, saying: [...] "Poppy Day establishes the band's perfect employ of atmospherics and sets the tone of all the tracks". [...] "Mother" [...] was compared to the soundtrack of an Alfred Hitchcock film, with Gurr noting that the [...] "track features a musical box, echoes menacing guitar grumblings and Siouxsie providing vocals that would befit any of Hitchcock's best matricides". Gurr concluded that with [...] "Severin's truly disturbing scratchings", Join Hands was a dangerous work that [...] "should be heard".|$|E
2500|$|It was {{the first}} tour of Australia by players instead of amateurs and {{professionals}} {{and the first time}} that the MCC travelled to Australia by air instead of by sea.

2500|$|Reese and Bianca are {{the first}} {{same-sex}} couple to become engaged for marriage on an American soap opera. On October 31, 2008, AfterEllen.com founder Sarah Warn stated, [...] "Bianca (Eden Riegel) and Reese's (Tamara Braun) much-anticipated engagement finally took place on ABC's daytime drama All My Children today (the first lesbian marriage proposal on daytime TV), <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>once,</b> the AMC writers didn't disappoint." [...] In addition, the couple has been allowed the type of physical intimacy not previously allowed between same-sex couples within the series. Their kiss following the marriage proposal {{was seen as a}} change in the show's attitude about portraying homosexual relationships. [...] "...They had an actual kiss — a real one, not a peck on the cheek," [...] stated Warn. She added that the kiss was significant due to romantic kisses, explicit or otherwise, between two women on All My Children or on any daytime drama being rare.|$|E

That was something I thought would obviously be good to do." [...] Foy researched witchcraft and demonic possession for the role. She described its appeal, [...] "Playing a character that was making things happen, and mainly in control of an entire group of men. <b>And</b> <b>for</b> <b>once,</b> be the character that is completely in the know about everything. There is nothing that she doesn't know. Nothing is a surprise. And she is able to deal with every single situation that arises the way that she sees fit.
