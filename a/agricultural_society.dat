5|$|John Clough Holmes (September 25, 1809 – December 16, 1887) was {{responsible}} for the establishment of Michigan State University.

Holmes Hall, the home of the Lyman Briggs College, is named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|The 18th {{century was}} largely one {{of peace and}} declining {{industrial}} prosperity in Somerset. The Industrial Revolution in the Midlands and Northern England spelt the end for most of Somerset's cottage industries. However, farming continued to flourish, with the Bath and West of England <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Society</b> being founded in 1777 to improve methods. John Billingsley conducted {{a survey of the}} county's agriculture in 1795 but found that methods could still be improved.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving to}} Detroit at age 26, Holmes married into a {{merchant}} family. He later {{got involved in}} both the Detroit Horticultural Society and the Board of Education. In 1849, his background in horticulture and education led him to co-found the Michigan State <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Society,</b> a group dedicated to establishing a state-funded agricultural college in Michigan. Holmes spent {{the next six years}} drafting legislation and gaining support for his cause, and in 1855, the Michigan state governor signed a bill establishing the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to better {{conditions}} for the farmer (by which Tillman always meant white males only), in 1884 he founded the Edgefield Agricultural Club. It died for lack of members. Undeterred, Tillman tried again in January 1885, beginning the Edgefield County <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Society.</b> Its membership also dwindled, but Tillman was elected one of three delegates to the August joint meeting of the state Grange and the state Agricultural and Mechanical Society at Bennettsville, and was invited {{to be one of}} the speakers.|$|E

In 1811, President James Madison offered him a {{position}} as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, but he declined on account of failing eyesight. Lincoln retired to his Worcester estate, where he took an active interest in farming; his pursuit of scientific interests related to agriculture were widely recognized, and he served as the first president of the Worcester <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Society,</b> founded in 1818.|$|E

He also approved the formation of the Kentucky State <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Society</b> in 1856. The state geological survey begun under Governor Lazarus W. Powell was completed and published. Internal improvements progressed as well; railroad mileage in the state increased from 242 miles to 568 miles during Morehead's term.|$|E
5|$|Upon Shelby's {{leaving office}} in 1816, President Monroe offered him {{the post of}} Secretary of War, but he {{declined}} because of his age. Already {{a founding member of}} the Kentucky Bible Society, Shelby consented to serve as vice-president of the New American Bible Society in 1816. He was a faithful member of Danville Presbyterian church, but in 1816, built a small nondenominational church on his property. In 1818, he accompanied Andrew Jackson in negotiating the Jackson Purchase with the Chickasaw. He also served as the first president of the Kentucky <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Society</b> in 1818 and was chairman of the first board of trustees of Centre College in 1819.|$|E
5|$|Whereas {{the common}} law {{protected}} habitation and sources of wealth and food in a largely <b>agricultural</b> <b>society,</b> the Industrial Revolution, especially the Luddism resulting from workers' perceived threats to their livelihood, required new legislation to match the circumstances. The reaction of Parliament to Luddism was to criminalise machine-breaking – the destruction of textile-making machinery – as early as 1721. Initially the punishment was transportation to the Colonies {{but as a result}} of continued opposition to mechanisation the Frame-Breaking Act of 1812 made the death penalty available.|$|E

5|$|At {{the dawn}} of the Industrial Revolution, {{development}} of the mining and metallurgical industries transformed the country from an <b>agricultural</b> <b>society</b> into an industrial nation; the South Wales Coalfield's exploitation caused a rapid expansion of Wales' population. Two-thirds of the population live in south Wales, mainly in and around Cardiff (the capital), Swansea and Newport, and in the nearby valleys. Now that the country's traditional extractive and heavy industries have gone or are in decline, Wales' economy depends on the public sector, light and service industries and tourism. Wales' 2010 gross value added (GVA) was £45.5 billion (£15,145 per head, 74.0% of the average for the UK, and the lowest GVA per head in Britain).|$|E
5|$|In 1878, whilst {{still working}} for Spratt's, Cruft {{travelled}} across Europe {{to expand the}} biscuit business.

Further offers to run shows came in for Cruft, including an offer to become Secretary of the Dutch Kennel Club, and an offer to run the livestock section of the Brussels and Antwerp International Exhibitions. He took up job offers to run the shows for the Scottish Kennel Club, and became manager of the poultry section of the shows of the Royal <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Society.</b> He also co-founded and became club secretary of the Schipperke Club of Brussels.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford {{quickly became}} deeply {{involved}} in the community. Among the roles he acquired during his first three years in the District of Alberta were President of the newly formed South Edmonton Football Club, secretary-treasurer of the South Edmonton School Board, president of the South Edmonton Athletic Association, vice president of the South Edmonton Literary Institute, auditor of the South Edmonton <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Society,</b> and worthy master of the Acacia Lodge, Ancient Free and Accepted Masons. He later added to this the title of secretary of the Edmonton District Butter and Cheese Manufacturing Association. He was an early advocate for the incorporation of South Edmonton, hitherto an unincorporated community. When incorporation came in 1899—as the Town of Strathcona—Rutherford became the new town's secretary-treasurer (after acting as returning officer in its first election).|$|E

5|$|Starting {{the late}} 19th century, {{uncontrolled}} crossbreeding created {{a decline in}} the population of purebred Mérens. By the early 20th century, some breeders in L'Hospitalet and Mérens-les-Vals began to work against these crossings with outside breeds and bred only horses with conformation similar to the original Mérens. These breeders wanted to keep alive the traditional Mérens, which they valued for its hardiness and versatility. In 1908, control of breeding was given to the President of the Société d’Agriculture de l’Ariège (<b>Agricultural</b> <b>Society</b> of Ariege), Gabriel Lamarque, who was dedicated to the preservation of the breed. In 1933, the Syndicat d'élevage du Mérens (Breeding Society of Mérens) was created, and in 1948 the first stud book was created {{under the control of the}} French National Stud.|$|E
5|$|The Limousin breed {{was also}} not immune to the wave of Anglomania {{affecting}} France {{in the middle of}} the 19th century. Some wealthy farmers maintained Durham cattle, which were prized by the elite of the time. However, this practice was criticised by the <b>agricultural</b> <b>society</b> of Limoges. The society encouraged farmers to continue selecting animals that were most consistent with the characteristics of the Limousin breed, which was perfectly adapted to the region's environment, rather than trying to adapt other breeds. Furthermore, the vast majority of Limousin breeders could not afford to raise livestock in addition to their working animals, as was the case on larger properties that practiced crossing with Durham cattle.|$|E
5|$|WINDALCO {{reported}} {{a loss of}} 10,000tons of aluminum due to flooding. Manufacturing companies reported J$18.3million (US$296,000) in losses, primarily from suspended operations. In November, the Jamaica Labour Party sought J$3.2billion (US$51.8million) in additional funding to repair roads damaged by Hurricanes Ivan, Dennis, Emily, and Wilma. The following month, the Jamaica <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Society</b> received J$5.5million (US$88,266) from the Japanese embassy to assist 500farmers in Portland Parish. The long-term effects of Dennis were limited, with nearly every economic sector returning to normal within a few months. The only exceptions were exports of banana and coffee crops, {{both of which were}} still recovering from Hurricane Ivan in 2004. Overall implications to the nation's gross domestic product were negligible, merely flat-lining growth rather than causing decline. However, in combination with the effects of a drought early in 2005, inflation values required adjustment upwards from 9% to 14.3%.|$|E
