6000|$|This epistle was not {{the letter}} of Lord Hillsborough solely, though he held the {{official}} pen. It was {{the letter of the}} noble lord upon the floor,[5] and of all the king's then ministers, who (with, I think, the exception of two only) are his ministers at this hour. The very first news that a British Parliament heard of what it was to do with the duties which it had given and granted to the king was by the publication of the votes of American assemblies. It was in America that your resolutions were pre-declared. It was from thence that we knew to a certainty how much exactly, and not a scruple more nor less, we were to repeal. We were unworthy to be let into the secret of our own conduct. The assemblies had confidential communications from his Majesty's confidential servants. We were nothing but instruments. Do you, after this, wonder that you have no weight and no respect in the colonies? After this <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> Parliament is every day and everywhere losing (I feel it with sorrow, I utter it with reluctance) that reverential affection which so endearing a name of authority ought ever to carry with it? that you are obeyed solely from respect to the bayonet? and that this House, the ground and pillar of freedom, is itself held up only by the treacherous underpinning and clumsy buttresses of arbitrary power? ...|$|E

I have {{had the experience of}} forty years in the duties of the priesthood. In that long time, the innermost secrets of thousands of men and women have been confided to me. From such means of observation, I have drawn many useful conclusions; and some of them may be also useful to you. I will put what I have to say, in the plainest and fewest words: consider them carefully, on your side. The growth of the better nature, in women, is perfected by one influence--and that influence is Love. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> a priest should write in this way? Did you expect me to say, Religion? Love, my sister, is Religion, in women. It opens their hearts to all that is good for them; and it acts independently of the conditions of human happiness. A miserable woman, tormented by hopeless love, is still the better and the nobler for that love; and a time will surely come when she will show it. You have fears for Carmina--cast away, poor soul, among strangers with hard hearts! I tell you to have no fears. She may suffer under trials; she may sink under trials. But the strength to rise again is in her--and that strength is Love.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Probably <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>surprised,</b> ladies, <b>that</b> I, a stranger, have {{remained}} so long to-night. The truth is, I {{had come here}} to have some conversation on private and very important matters, but finding you so lively, and, I must add, so pleasantly engaged, I deemed it expedient to defer my conversation until <b>you</b> should <b>be</b> more at leisure." ...|$|R
6000|$|CHARLES. Why, there's the point! my distresses are so many, that I can't affort to {{part with}} my spirits; but I shall be rich and splenetic, all in good time. However, I suppose <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> I am not more sorrowful at parting with so many near relations; to be sure, 'tis very affecting; but you see they never move a muscle, so why should I? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> I {{should be}} {{interested}} in humanity." [...] She stood facing him. [...] "Well, I am," [...] she said, half humorously, half defiantly. [...] "I believe I am more interested in human beings than in {{anything else in the}} world--when they are natural, as these people are and when they will tell one their joys and their troubles and their opinions." ...|$|R

CNN described Leisure Town as a [...] "quirky, {{some would}} say twisted, photo comic {{was nominated for a}} Webby Award two years ago, and has developed a cult following." [...] Farnon described the financial difficulties of creating webcomics, saying [...] "If I can support myself doing Leisure Town, I will <b>be</b> very <b>surprised.</b> <b>You</b> realize <b>that</b> when you make online comics, you're sort of folding up your product into a paper airplane and sailing it out the window, and who knows who's going to catch it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{must stop}} here for to-day. To-morrow I shall come to {{disclosures}} of vital interest to <b>you.</b> Have <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> I, your enemy by every cause of enmity {{that one man}} can have against another, should write to you so fully about the secrets of my early life? I have done so, because I wish the strife between us to be an open strife on my side; because I desire that you should know thoroughly {{what you have to}} expect from my character, after such a life as I have led. There was purpose in my deceit, when I deceived you--there is purpose in my frankness, when I now tell you all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I tell you, Mark, and I {{would tell}} your namesake the apostle, that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> hard on me. You have practised sobriety and {{hypocrisy}} from your hanging sleeves till your Geneva cassock--from the cradle to this day,--and it {{is a thing}} of nature to you; and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> a rough, rattling, honest fellow, accustomed to speak truth all his life, and especially when he found it {{at the bottom of a}} flask, cannot be so perfect a prig as thyself--Zooks! there is no equality betwixt us--A trained diver might as well, because he can retain his breath for ten minutes without inconvenience, upbraid a poor devil for being like to burst in twenty seconds, at the bottom of ten fathoms water--And, after all, considering the guise is so new to me, I think I bear myself indifferently well--try me!" ...|$|R

Madame Melmotte is not my mamma, though papa chooses {{that it should be}} thought so.' All this she whispered, with rapid words, almost into Hetta's ear. 'And papa is so cruel to me! He beats me sometimes.' The new friend, round whom Marie still had her arm, shuddered as she heard this. 'But I never will yield a bit for that. When he boxes and thumps me I always turn and gnash my teeth at him. Can you wonder that I want to have a friend? Can <b>you</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> I should be always {{thinking}} of my lover? But,--if he doesn't love me, what am I to do then?' ...|$|R
6000|$|After {{these words}} the lady led Prince Ahmed into the hall. Then {{she sat down}} on a sofa, and when the Prince by her entreaty had done the same she said: [...] "You <b>are</b> <b>{{surprised}},</b> <b>you</b> say, <b>that</b> I should know <b>you</b> and not <b>be</b> known by <b>you,</b> but <b>you</b> will <b>be</b> no longer surprised when I inform <b>you</b> who I <b>am.</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> undoubtedly sensible that your religion teaches you to believe that the world is inhabited by genies as well as men. I am the daughter {{of one of the most}} powerful and distinguished genies, and my name is Paribanou. The only thing that I have to add <b>is,</b> that <b>you</b> seemed to me worthy of a more happy fate than that of possessing the Princess Nouronnihar; and, that you might attain to it, I <b>was</b> present when <b>you</b> drew your arrow, and foresaw it would not go beyond Prince Houssain's. I took it in the air, and gave it the necessary motion to strike against the rocks near which you found it, and I tell you that it lies in your power to make use of the favorable opportunity which presents itself to make you happy." ...|$|R
5000|$|Weathered {{veterans}} of the Houston scene, Truth Decay includes {{former members of the}} Pain Teens (arguably the best-known-outside-of-Houston postpunk outfit this city's ever produced) and legendary art-punks Ms. Carriage and the Casual Tease. The tall, scary frontman has even played sax on Really Red records, which takes us back to the early Reagan years. So yes, they can be excused for being bitter old bastards, which they <b>are.</b> What'll <b>surprise</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> their music is also so... catchy. They write tight, solid songs, always sharp, often funny and fueled by with guitar pyrotechnics that ought to make big-haired poseurs think about going back to get those dental hygienist certifications their moms are always nagging 'em about. Indeed, TD's weirdly crowd-pleasing arena-rock/punk would qualify as radio-friendly in any other universe but our own. As it is, they work the circuit of local dives regularly. See them grind out an ancient Houston punk masterpiece like [...] "Atomic Bomb" [...] and realize that there have always been great punk rock bands in Houston, that you've probably never heard (or heard of) any of them and that half of them included the guys now in Truth Decay.

5000|$|During the credits, Machete has Carmen sing as an {{undercover}} pop {{star in a}} concert.

After the performance, Carmen asks Machete, [...] "What, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>surprised</b> your gadgets work?" [...] Machete then tells Carmen, [...] "I just realized, I never put any batteries in this." [...] Carmen is shocked to find out she can, in fact, sing without auto-tune.
