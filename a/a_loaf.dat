5|$|Like {{the other}} {{characters}} of the series, Perry was structured in a simple style to allow young viewers to easily draw him. In keeping with the show's general design scheme, Perry is constructed of geometric shapes in a style reminiscent of deceased Looney Tunes animator Tex Avery. Povenmire uses different design styles for drawing Perry depending on how he is portrayed. When Perry is portrayed as a domesticated and mindless pet, Povenmire begins with a square shaped like <b>a</b> <b>loaf</b> of bread. He then draws his front legs and feet before drawing his bill, which is set at a certain angle. Povenmire then draws his eyeballs, which are never focused and look in opposing directions in a daze. He concludes the figure by adding his hind legs, tail, hair, and finally color.|$|E

At this time, the worshipper usually engages in silent prayerful worship of the Lord Jesus Christ.|$|E

25|$|On May 3, 2007 {{at around}} 7:00a.m., {{a chunk of}} {{concrete}} {{about the size of}} <b>a</b> <b>loaf</b> of bread fell from the Kipling Avenue bridge onto the Gardiner Expressway.

City crews were quickly sent to close off lanes of traffic to begin an inspection of the structure, which is a late 1960s post-tensioned design built by the province while it was still part of the QEW. This incident raised fears about safety of the highway, particularly with memories of the then-recent overpass collapse in Laval, Quebec, still fresh in the minds of motorists and media.|$|E
