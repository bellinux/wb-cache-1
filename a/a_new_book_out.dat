40|$|The {{purpose of}} this book is to develop those ethical traditions. For example, Horkheimer’s books Eclipse of Reason and Critique of Instrumental Reason, and his early and now classic essay Materialism and Morality ask for a reformation of Kantian ethics. The reform sought is that {{categorical}} imperative in an individualism capitalism serves to worsen the difference between business ethics and moral philosophy. That is, {{it is not enough}} to try to be good or ethical as individuals when it is the systemic processes that must be dealt with. Therefore, Horkheimer asks that the maxim that would be made universal be done at the level of people organizing with others to change the social system that is producing the unethical behaviors. The book is organized into several sections. The first section sets the stages, beginning with a challenge to the field of social responsibility in business and public administration (Jones, Ten bos, & Parker have <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>out</b> that is smashing). Then, we turn to Carr and to Zanettic who each have done critical theory work in public administration. This is followed by Heather Hopfl, who edited an issue on ethics of goodness, and does the kind of writing that makes deep connections. The next set of chapters make topic connections: rhizomatics, dialogics of co experience, story/narrative, and postmodern. The third set of topics focus on application: technofuturist, international business, economics, university, environment, accounting, spirituality, strategy, and ending with Mills’ work on silence of race/ethnicity in business (and public administration) ethics writing...|$|E
40|$|IT HAS GOTTEN TO THE POINT, nowadays, that {{whenever}} I see <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>book</b> <b>out</b> with “libertarian ” or “libertarianism ” in the title, I cringe. It {{is not because}} I don’t think that on net balance, they are not all forces for the good. They are. Given that they at least spell {{the name of this}} philosophy correctly, they do more good than harm. The more publications of this sort the better. If we are to promote libertarianism, it cannot be done without continually keeping the concept of liberty in the public mind, and there are few better ways to do this than by publishing more and more volumes on this topic. But, on the other hand, and, believe me, there is another hand, I still cringe when I peruse such titles. For example, consider Murray, 1997. Gordon’s 1997 title of the review of this book says it all: “Nationalize Education and Other Libertarian Ideas. ” To claim that libertarianism requires public schools, let alone vast new public expenditures on education is enough to register a high value on my cringe-o-meter. Tucker, 1997 reviews Boaz, 1997 and says: On health care, Social Security, education, and foreign policy, we don’t get principled theorizing so much as we get half-way and halfbaked policy plans for vouchers, Medical Savings Accounts …, the line-item veto, and revenue diversions of Social Security from bonds to stocks …. In short, Boaz presents libertarianism not as a radical and fundamental challenge to the socialist and social-democratic consensus that has dominated this century and erected the largest and most intrusive governments in human history...|$|E

One theme in the book that is likely to be of special interest to those who follow this blog is her frequent discussion of similarities and differences over time in patterns of unrest and the way that the state and its representatives respond to challenges from below. Focusing largely on tensions and modes of accommodation between central authorities and local communities, Crossley offers <b>an</b> intriguing <b>new</b> way of thinking about many of the big upheavals of the recent past, from the White Lotus Rebellion to the recent unrest in Tibet and Xinjiang. In this excerpt, however, which gives a good sense of the liveliness of the book’s prose as well as the kinds of subjects it addresses, we see how her approach {{can also be used to}} shed light on minor fracases of the sort that anyone who has spent time in China is likely to have witnessed at some point during their stay. It is unusual for the contents of a semi-confidential email to become universally known on the Internet. But in March of 2009, after the nomination of Charles W. Freeman Jr. as chair of the American government’s National Intelligence Council, his email to the ChinaSec listserv group of May 26, 2006 drew attention for this comment about the Tiananmen incidents of 1989 : “I find the dominant view in China about this very plausible, i. e. that the truly unforgivable mistake of the Chinese authorities was the failure to intervene on a timely basis to nip the demonstrations in the bud, rather than – as would have been both wise and efficacious – to intervene with force when all other measures had failed to restore domestic tranquility to Beijing and other major urban centers in China. In this optic, the Politburo’s response to the mob scene at ‘Tian’anmen’ stands as a monument to overly cautious behavior on the part of the leadership, not as an example of rash action. ...|$|R
5000|$|Artist Patrick J. Reynolds {{was born}} in New Orleans in 1963 where he began his long and {{distinguished}} career. At age 11 he began winning awards and receiving {{the respect of the}} elite of the art world. Having unlimited styles at his disposal in the art community of New Orleans, Patrick decided early on to not conform to any of them, Instead, carving out his own way creating a style never before seen.Today, Patrick is the only artist in the United States to maintain graphite block and limestone suspended in oil. As he developed the medium over time, graphite figurative romanticism was born. And one could easily say that his art will be carved into the history books and studied for generations to come.Today, Patrick pushes the envelope of his style, forever exploring the stories that can be told through art. The signature style remains evident in every new layout drawing or final masterpiece. [...] "The passion is the same" [...] says Patrick. [...] "It's a burning desire to begin a piece that has already been completed in my head. It must materialize, it must come to life."."Fanciful or not, the winged beings tell the tales that course through Reynolds' soul and spring from his fingertips." [...] Says [...]Patrick begins his pieces by grinding graphite and limestone into boiled linseed oil and varying thickness on his palette. He then uses a brush to swirl the mixture onto the board creating both texture and form. The result becomes a rock hard fine art that will last for centuries.Art collectors {{from all walks of life}} describe the work as moving, and that is what it is intended to do, move you. Rarely, if ever, does it match the couch or the curtains. Patrick's work falls into the category of generational collections.

She {{was working on a}} script for television (a famous French actor had asked her to write an adventure series where he would have the leading role [...] ). This time the story would not play in bygone centuries, but begin in 1918, quite a novelty for Benzoni. However the producer of the future televison series Claude Barma died shortly afterwards and the project broke down. Some years later, she remembered that she had still the script and offered it to her publisher. What first started to be a series of 4 Novels, each titled after a world famous precious stone, became another of the authors unquestionably great success, besides the Catherine series. The Novels were devoured not just by the female readers but also the male. Prince Aldo Morosini a kind of Simon Templar, (enthralling detail, the hero is half French, half Venetian), when he returns home from World War 1 to Venice, to his fathers Palace at the Grand Canal, he finds his Mother murdered and the family heirloom The Blue Star (Sapphire) stolen. He decides not to inform the Police, but to search the thief-murderer himself. Instead of marrying a rich wife as is suggested to him by the family lawyer, he becomes an antiquarian, specialist on precious and ancient stones. The pursuit after the stones and murderer brings him to many foreign countries, like Paris, Zurich, Vienna, London, Warsaw, Seville, Prague, Jerusalem, Cairo and even as far as the United States. The adventures of the dashing Aldo Morosini kept Benzoni's readers not just in France spellbound. The books were translated in [...] Hungary, Portugal, Spain, Russia, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Greece and Poland [...] Due to its success the author started in between other novels to regularly write <b>a</b> <b>new</b> adventure of her favourite hero, of whom Benzoni once said in an Interview 2010 : I would love to have Aldo Morosini as a nephew!
