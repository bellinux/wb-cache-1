5|$|All whales have <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of blubber. In {{species that}} {{live near the}} poles, the blubber can be as thick as 11 inches. This blubber can help with {{buoyancy}} (which is helpful for a 100-ton whale), protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard}} time getting through <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of fat, and energy for fasting when migrating to the equator; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. It can constitute as much as 50% of a whale's body weight. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with thick lanugos.|$|E
5|$|Cetaceans {{includes}} whales, dolphins and porpoises. They are the mammals most fully {{adapted to}} aquatic {{life with a}} spindle-shaped nearly hairless body, protected by <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of blubber, and forelimbs and tail modified to provide propulsion underwater.|$|E
5|$|Elements of the cold, harsh {{environment}} of the Alps are apparent: distant mountains capped in snow rise up behind Napoleon and his troupe, while a steep cliff face appears on his left, and the path underfoot has <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of ice.|$|E

50|$|The report {{recommended}} that Trilcor work with its supplier of laminating layer {{to resolve the}} problem, and indicated that <b>a</b> <b>thicker</b> <b>layer</b> of material would likely perform better.|$|R
5000|$|Puerto Fino, made around El Puerto de Santa María. The cooler climate {{near the}} sea results in <b>a</b> <b>thicker</b> <b>layer</b> of flor {{and a more}} acidic and {{delicate}} flavour than Jerez Fino.|$|R
5|$|Odontocetes possess {{teeth with}} {{cementum}} cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of}} the tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Porpoises, like other odontocetes, possess only one blowhole. Breathing involves expelling stale air from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. All porpoises have <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of blubber. This blubber can help with insulation from the harsh underwater climate, protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard time}} getting through <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of fat, and energy for leaner times. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with a covering of fine, downy hair known as lanugo.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 3, the local weather station {{reported}} clear conditions due to a malfunction, while <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of fog rolled onto the highway. Dozens of vehicles including several semi-trailers quickly crashed into each other shortly after 8a.m., one following another in the dense fog, and the accumulating wreckage caught traffic travelling in the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} have {{a relatively}} thin layer of blubber. Blubber can help with buoyancy, protection from predators (they {{would have a hard}} time getting through <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of fat), energy for leaner times, and insulation from harsh climates. The habitats of river dolphins lack these needs.|$|E
5000|$|Earth (or other dense material) can be heaped {{up against}} the exposed walls of the building; this forces the gamma rays to pass through <b>a</b> <b>thicker</b> <b>layer</b> of {{shielding}} before entering the house.|$|R
5000|$|The {{formation}} is <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layering</b> of fine-grained, altered volcaniclastic sediments. Most of these sediments are ash-rich mudstone, siltstone, and very fine sandstone. There is also coarser sandstone, conglomerate, carbonates, and ash tuff.|$|R
50|$|Variations of {{the drink}} involve {{the use of}} cream instead of milk, and {{flavoring}} with cinnamon or chocolate powder. It is typically smaller in volume than a caffè latte, with <b>a</b> <b>thicker</b> <b>layer</b> of micro foam.|$|R
5|$|The {{geological}} {{study of}} Antarctica {{has been greatly}} hindered by {{nearly all of the}} continent being permanently covered with <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of ice. However, new techniques such as remote sensing, ground-penetrating radar and satellite imagery have begun to reveal the structures beneath the ice.|$|E
5|$|Earth {{has evolved}} through {{geological}} and biological processes that have left {{traces of the}} original conditions. The outer surface is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates. The interior remains active, with <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the geomagnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Ida's surface appears heavily cratered {{and mostly}} gray, {{although}} minor color variations mark newly formed or uncovered areas. Besides craters, other features are evident, such as grooves, ridges, and protrusions. Ida {{is covered by}} <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of regolith, loose debris that obscures the solid rock beneath. The largest, boulder-sized, debris fragments are called ejecta blocks, several {{of which have been}} observed on the surface.|$|E
50|$|Quaker Run has <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layering</b> of iron {{precipitate}} {{along its}} length. The <b>layering</b> is more <b>thick</b> and solidly packed than {{in some other}} nearby streams. Historically, there was a quarry near the stream. Mine complexes also extend under the stream.|$|R
50|$|The Folsom horizon {{in block}} A is defined within <b>a</b> 2.5 cm <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> {{containing}} 3 Folsom points. The Clovis horizon is found below Folsom within <b>a</b> 2.5 cm <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> containing Clovis diagnostics. The Buttermilk Creek Complex is found below Clovis and defined within <b>a</b> 20 cm <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> containing artifacts. There were 18 OSL dates ranging from 14,000-17,500 BP taken from this layer.|$|R
40|$|Compositionally {{modulated}} Co/Mn {{thin films}} were prepared by UHV evaporation. The artificial periodicity {{was confirmed by}} small angle X-ray diffraction. The CMF composed of 10 <b>Å</b> <b>thick</b> Co <b>layers</b> and 13 <b>Å</b> <b>thick</b> Mn <b>layers</b> showed anomalous magnetization processes below 60 K which resemble those observed in superconducting ferromagnetic alloys...|$|R
5|$|Kohala's native Hawaiian {{rain forest}} has <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of ferns and mosses {{carpeting}} the floor, which act as sponges, absorbing water from rain and passing {{much of it}} through to the groundwater in aquifers below; when feral animals like pigs trample the covering, the forest loses its ability to hold in water effectively, and instead of recharging the aquifer, it results in a severe loss of topsoil, much of which ends up being dumped by streams into the ocean.|$|E
5|$|Cells of {{the genus}} Azotobacter are {{relatively}} large for bacteria (1–2 μm in diameter). They are usually oval, but may take various forms from rods to spheres. In microscopic preparations, the cells can be dispersed or form irregular clusters or occasionally chains of varying lengths. In fresh cultures, cells are mobile due to the numerous flagella. Later, the cells lose their mobility, become almost spherical, and produce <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of mucus, forming the cell capsule. The shape of the cell {{is affected by the}} amino acid glycine which is present in the nutrient medium peptone.|$|E
5|$|Cerebellar granule cells, in {{contrast}} to Purkinje cells, are among the smallest neurons in the brain. They are also easily the most numerous neurons in the brain: In humans, estimates of their total number average around 50 billion, which means that about 3/4 of the brain's neurons are cerebellar granule cells. Their cell bodies are packed into <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> {{at the bottom of}} the cerebellar cortex. A granule cell emits only four to five dendrites, each of which ends in an enlargement called a dendritic claw. These enlargements are sites of excitatory input from mossy fibers and inhibitory input from Golgi cells.|$|E
50|$|Hypercementosis is an idiopathic, non-neoplastic {{condition}} {{characterized by}} the excessive buildup of normal cementum (calcified tissue) on the roots {{of one or more}} teeth. <b>A</b> <b>thicker</b> <b>layer</b> of cementum can give the tooth an enlarged appearance, which mainly occurs at the apex or apices of the tooth.|$|R

30|$|Moreover, from Table  2, {{thicknesses}} of {{the films}} deposited at 50, 100 and 150  W are measured to be 100, 180 and 400  nm, respectively. Profilometer results suggest that by increasing the RF power, more reactants with higher energy are produced which can result in <b>a</b> <b>thicker</b> <b>layer.</b>|$|R
5|$|Linezolid is {{effective}} against all clinically important Gram-positive bacteria—those whose cell wall contains <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of peptidoglycan and no outer membrane—notably Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant enterococci), Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, the viridans group streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium species (the latter {{being among the}} most susceptible to linezolid, with minimum inhibitory concentrations routinely below 0.5mg/L). Linezolid is also highly active in vitro against several mycobacteria. It appears to be very effective against Nocardia, but because of high cost and potentially serious adverse effects, authors have recommended that it be combined with other antibiotics or reserved for cases that have failed traditional treatment.|$|E
5|$|The {{structures}} at Zaculeu {{were grouped}} around small plazas and were generally built from masonry, coated with <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of plaster. Fragments bear floral and geometric designs, indicating the structures were originally brightly painted. Stones were undressed and cemented in adobe mortar. No evidence of corbel vaulting {{has been found}} and {{very little in the}} way of stone sculpture. The architecture completely lacks stone sculpture. Burials from the Early Classic yielded a rich array of finds, but Late Classic burials were accompanied by a lesser variety of grave offerings.|$|E
5|$|Dacite eruptions in the Lassen area {{typically}} {{begin with}} steam explosions {{caused by the}} interaction of rising magma with ground water. When dacite magma charged with volcanic gases reaches the surface, it erupts explosively, usually as a vertical column of gas and ash that can rise several miles into the atmosphere. Heavy fallback of hot ash and rock fragments from eruption columns may generate highly mobile pyroclastic flows that can rush several miles down a volcano's slopes and adjacent valleys. Fallout from the eruption column can blanket areas within a few miles (~8km) of the vent with <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of pumice, and high-altitude winds may carry finer ash tens to {{hundreds of miles from}} the volcano, posing a hazard to flying aircraft, particularly those with jet engines.|$|E
5000|$|The zonule of Zinn {{is split}} into two layers: a thin layer, which lines the hyaloid fossa, and <b>a</b> <b>thicker</b> <b>layer,</b> which is <b>a</b> {{collection}} of zonular fibers. Together, the fibers are known as the suspensory ligament of the lens. [...] The zonules are about 1-2 μm in diameter.|$|R
500|$|A type of soil {{known as}} the Leck Kill soil occurs along Catawissa Creek. Usually, {{cultivated}} Leck Kill soils are topped with <b>an</b> [...] <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of dark brown silt loam, with a subsoil of reddish-brown silt loam that extends {{to a depth of}} [...] Below the subsoil is <b>a</b> [...] <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of clay loam. The bedrock below this type of soil is red shale.|$|R
40|$|Polymer {{solar cells}} with <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> active <b>layer</b> can {{generate}} large photocurrent because they absorb many more photons. In most cases, however, the active layer is {{as thin as}} ~ 100 nm under the optimized condition. In this work, we have studied bimolecular charge recombination in highly efficient polymer solar cells with <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> active <b>layer</b> by transient photovoltage and photocurrent measurements. As a result, {{we found that the}} bimolecular recombination rate is smaller by three orders of magnitude than that predicted from the diffusion-limited Langevin recombination. We therefore conclude that such reduced bimolecular recombination enables efficient charge collection even in the solar cell with <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> active <b>layer...</b>|$|R
5|$|Many of Royal Oaks crew who {{had managed}} to jump from the sinking ship were dressed {{in little more than}} their nightclothes and were {{unprepared}} for the chilling water. <b>A</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of fuel oil coated the surface, filling men's lungs and stomachs and hampering their efforts to swim. Of those who attempted the half-mile (800 m) swim to the nearest shore, only a handful survived. Gatt switched the lights of Daisy 2 on and he and his crew managed to pull 386 men from the water, including Royal Oaks commander, Captain William Benn. The rescue efforts continued for another {{two and a half hours}} until nearly 4:00am, when Gatt abandoned the search for more survivors and took those he had to Pegasus. Although aided by boats from Pegasus and the harbour, he was responsible for rescuing almost all the survivors, an act for which he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the only military award made by the British in connection with the disaster.|$|E
5|$|The frog cake {{is a small}} dessert {{shaped to}} {{resemble}} a frog with its mouth open, consisting of a sponge base with a jam centre, topped in artificial cream and covered with <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> of fondant icing. The recipe today remains {{identical to the one}} employed when the cake was first produced in the 1920s. When manufactured, large layers of sponge cake are combined and cut mechanically into shape, covered in the fondant, and the mouth is then formed with a hot knife. Fondant eyes of a contrasting colour are manually added to the head, and the completed dessert is presented in a paper patty-pan. The fondant is normally brown, green or pink, but for special occasions colours can include variations such as red and yellow.|$|E
5|$|The park's woods are {{important}} because they provide shelter for {{a large number of}} animals. They are a natural defence against landslides, avalanches, and flooding. The two main types of woods found in the park are coniferous and deciduous woods. The deciduous European beech forests are common on the Piedmont side of the park, and are not found on the dryer Valle d'Aosta side. These forests are thick with dense foliage that lets in very little light during the summer. The beech leaves {{take a long time to}} decompose, and they form <b>a</b> <b>thick</b> <b>layer</b> on the woodland floor that impedes the development of other plants and trees. Larches are the most common trees in the forests on the valley floors. They are mixed with spruces, Swiss stone pines, and more rarely silver firs.|$|E
