5|$|During this period, an army {{formation}} of around 5,000 men (of both heavy and light infantry) {{was known as}} <b>a</b> <b>legion.</b> The manipular army was based upon social class, age and military experience. Maniples were units of 120 men each drawn from a single infantry class.|$|E
5|$|The goddess he worshipped {{the most}} zealously, however, was Minerva.

5|$|The {{same year}} the Jews of the Judaea {{province}} revolted against the Roman Empire {{in what is}} now known as the First Jewish-Roman War.

5|$|Although {{the revolt}} was quickly suppressed, exaggerated reports of {{disaster}} prompted Mucianus to depart the capital with reinforcements of his own. Domitian eagerly sought {{the opportunity to}} attain military glory and joined the other officers {{with the intention of}} commanding <b>a</b> <b>legion</b> of his own. According to Tacitus, Mucianus was not keen on this prospect but since he considered Domitian a liability in any capacity that was entrusted to him, he preferred to keep him close at hand rather than in Rome.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1798 the Legions under Kniaziewicz were {{fighting}} against the anti-French forces from the Kingdom of Naples, defeating them at the Battle of Civita Castellana on 4 December. Soon afterward, supplies from the captured Gaeta fortress allowed the creation of <b>a</b> <b>Legion</b> cavalry unit under Andrzej Karwowski. The Poles then fought at Magliano, Falari, Calvi and Capua before Naples capitulated on 23 January.|$|E
5|$|Captain Marion Frederic Ramírez de Arellano, (1913–1980) USN, {{the first}} Hispanic {{submarine}} commanding officer, participated in five war patrols.

For his actions, he was awarded a Silver Stars Medal and <b>a</b> <b>Legion</b> of Merit Medal.|$|E
50|$|The Legio XXII Deiotariana, <b>a</b> Roman <b>legion,</b> traced its lineage back to Deiotarus. It was {{originally}} {{part of the}} Galatian Army, and the equivalent of three <b>legions.</b> After suffering <b>a</b> defeat it was considered just <b>a</b> single <b>legion,</b> and functioned as <b>an</b> informal Roman <b>legion</b> under Julius Caesar until Deiotarus' death, at which point it was incorporated into the Roman Army with its former king as its namesake.|$|R

In recognition of his work on the project, the Belgian government made him a Commander of the Order of the Crown and the British government made him an honorary Companion of the Order of the Bath.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, U.S. President Warren G. Harding {{received}} {{her at the}} White House to present her with the 1 gram of radium collected in the United States.

In 1922 she became a fellow of the French Academy of Medicine. She also travelled to other countries, appearing publicly and giving lectures in Belgium, Brazil, Spain, and Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Romans {{had moved}} the fleet from Tarentum to Brundisium to {{continue}} the watch on the movements of Philip and <b>a</b> <b>legion</b> had been sent in support, all {{under the command of}} the Roman propraetor Marcus Valerius Laevinus. Upon receiving word from Oricum of events in Illyria, Laevinus crossed over with his fleet and army. Landing at Oricum, Laevinus was able to retake the town with little fighting.|$|E

5|$|The Fifth Ward Wardroom was {{constructed}} {{and used as}} a polling place and meeting hall in a critical time when Pawtucket was incorporated as a city before later {{being used as a}} school and eventually <b>a</b> <b>legion</b> post. At the time it was nominated to the National Historic Register, the house was undergoing renovations to become a private single family residence. Prior to its conversion it was the Henrietta I.

5|$|Through his {{military}} reforms, which included consolidating or disbanding units of questionable loyalty, Augustus changed and regularized the legion, {{down to the}} hobnail pattern on the soles of army boots. <b>A</b> <b>legion</b> was organized into ten cohorts, each of which comprised six centuries, with a century further made up of ten squads (contubernia); the exact size of the Imperial legion, which {{is most likely to}} have been determined by logistics, has been estimated to range from 4,800 to 5,280.|$|E

5|$|At the Battle of Kursk, Novikov {{introduced}} new innovations such as shaped-charge bombs, night {{fighters and}} ground-attack aircraft. The Battle of Königsberg saw 2,500 combat aircraft under Novikov being {{made available to}} the besieging armies, with the Soviet air marshal recommending low level heavy night bombers being used. 514 of these dropped 4,440 tons of bombs on the beleaguered city. For his part in the operation Novikov was made Hero of the Soviet Union, and on June 24, 1944 the United States awarded him <b>a</b> <b>Legion</b> of Merit. Novikov then transferred to the Pacific Theatre to fight against Japan, where he was made Hero of the Soviet Union a second time for his work in forming large air armies to bomb Japanese forces in China and Korea.|$|E
5|$|Equestrians {{by birth}} would {{normally}} begin their military careers at c. 30 years of age. An axillary {{had to do}} 25 years of service before joining the army. Commands were held in a set sequence, each held for 3–4 years: prefect of an auxiliary cohors, tribunus militum in <b>a</b> <b>legion</b> and finally prefect of an auxiliary ala. In Hadrian's time, a fourth command was added, for exceptionally able officers, of prefect of an ala milliaria. Like officers senatorial rank, hereditary equestrians held civilian posts before and after their decade of military service, whereas non-hereditary officers tended {{to remain in the}} army, commanding various units in various provinces. By the 3rd century, most auxiliary prefects had exclusively military careers.|$|E
5|$|The Ioviani and Herculiani legions and equites Dalmatae are not {{mentioned}} by the sources as under Julian, but {{as part of}} the Gaul comitatus of usurper Magnentius. They are likely to have been inherited by Julian. If all these units were present at Strasbourg, the infantry total is 1,500 short, or 3,500 if Severus commanded an extra 2,000 men. Probably the names of a number of auxilia regiments (and possibly <b>a</b> <b>legion)</b> are missing in our sources. If so, {{at least one of these}} units is likely to be a sagittarii (archer) unit, as a comitatus would be incomplete without archer capacity. Overall, the most likely scenario is that Julian's force at Strasbourg consisted of 5-6 legiones and 10-14 auxilia of infantry and 6 vexillationes of cavalry.|$|E

5|$|The army {{is said to}} have {{increased}} from 3,000 to 4,000 men in the 5th century BC, and then again from 4,000 to 6,000 men sometime before 400 BC. This later army of 6,000 men were then divided into 60 centuries of 100 men each. According to Historian P. Fraccaro's hypothesis, when the Roman monarchy was replaced by two praetores in c. 500 BC, the royal legion was divided into two (one for each praetor), each legion comprising 3,000 hoplites. The velites and cavalry were also split equally (1,200 velites and 300 cavalry each), for a total of 4,500 men. This remained the normal size of a Republican legion {{until the end of the}} Social War (88 BC). However, Livy states that <b>a</b> <b>legion</b> at the time of Marcus Furius Camillus (early 4th century BC) consisted of only 3,000 infantry and 300 cavalry.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Jovovich {{starred in}} the horror/action film Resident Evil, {{released}} in the United States on March 15, 2002 {{and based on the}} CAPCOM video game series of the same name. She portrayed Alice, the film's heroine, who fights <b>a</b> <b>legion</b> of zombies created by the Umbrella Corporation. Jovovich had accepted the role because she and her brother Marco had been fans of the video game franchise. Jovovich had performed all the stunts required in the film, except for a scene that would involve her jumping to a cement platform, which her management deemed too dangerous, and had trained in karate, kickboxing, and combat-training. The film was commercially successful, grossing $17 million on its opening weekend, and gaining $40 million domestically and $102 million worldwide. Later, she portrayed the manipulative gang wife Erin in No Good Deed (2002), Nadine in the romantic comedy You Stupid Man (2002), punk rocker Fangora ("Fanny") in Dummy (2003), and provided a guest voice on the television series King of the Hill. The role of Fangora in Dummy allowed Jovovich to act in film with Oscar-winning Adrien Brody, who was a friend prior to filming. Jovovich found it easy to identify with this role because she felt Fangora possessed similar qualities to the actress' own life.|$|E
5|$|The NWOBHM {{triggered}} a renaissance in a stagnant rock genre, but took on heavy criticism for the excessive local media hype surrounding <b>a</b> <b>legion</b> of typically mediocre musicians. Detractors think that, unlike heavy metal {{of the preceding}} decades, their music was unoriginal and included no classic rock recordings. Nevertheless, these bands and their diverse output offered a blueprint that counterparts across the Western world would later emulate and expand. The collision of styles that characterised the NWOBHM {{is now seen as}} key to the diversification of heavy metal {{in the second half of}} the 1980s into various subgenres that came to the fore in the 1990s. The stardom of Def Leppard in the US provided a catalyst for the growth of glam metal, just as bands like Angel Witch, Witchfynde, Cloven Hoof and especially Venom generated the music, lyrics, cover art and attitude that sparked black metal in its various forms in Europe and America. Motörhead, Iron Maiden, Raven, Tank, Venom and other minor groups are viewed as precursors of speed metal and thrash metal, two subgenres which carried forward the crossover with punk, incorporating elements of hardcore while amplifying volume, velocity and aggressive tone.|$|E
