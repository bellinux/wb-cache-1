40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{biological}} {{basis for}} cancer of unknown primary (CUP) {{at the molecular}} level remains largely unknown, with no evidence of whether a common biological entity exists. Here, we assessed the possibility of identifying a common diagnostic biomarker for CUP using a microarray gene expression analysis. METHODS: Tumor mRNA samples from 60 patients with CUP were analyzed using the Affymetrix U 133 A Plus 2. 0 GeneChip and were normalized by asinh (hyperbolic <b>arc</b> <b>sine)</b> <b>transformation</b> to construct a mean gene-expression profile specific to CUP. A gene-expression profile specific to non-CUP group was constructed using publicly available raw microarray datasets. The t-tests were performed to compare the CUP with non-CUP groups and the top 59 CUP specific genes with the highest fold change were selected (p-value< 0. 001). RESULTS: Among the 44 genes that were up-regulated in the CUP group, 6 genes for ribosomal proteins were identified. Two of these genes (RPS 7 and RPL 11) are known {{to be involved in the}} Mdm 2 -p 53 pathway. We also identified several genes related to metastasis and apoptosis, suggesting a biological attribute of CUP. CONCLUSIONS: The protein products of the up-regulated and down-regulated genes identified in this study may be clinically useful as unique biomarkers for CUP...|$|E
40|$|A clonal {{seed orchard}} of Korean white pine in Chuncheon, Korea, was {{established}} in 1982 and some trees were stempruned at the height of 1 m or 2 m to increase nut production and provide easy cone collection in 1996. The stem-pruned trees yielded the highest nut production (mean = 3, 200 g), which is 1. 4 to 2. 2 times higher than that (1, 870 g) of un-pruned trees in 1999. As there was a large difference in quantity, it was questioned whether there are some differences in quality, i. e. seed component, because of highlyincreased seed production. Three trees per treatment, selected from the same family, provided seeds for three years for analysis from  2000 to 2002. The general component analysis followed the methods of AOAC and fatty acids were investigated by gas liquid chromatography.  The results obtained in percentage (%)  were changed to angles following the <b>arc</b> <b>sine</b> <b>transformation</b> and then analyzed. No significant differences were found among the three treatments, that is un-pruned, 1 m-stem-pruned and 2 m-stem-pruned treatment, or among years in ash (1. 67 ~ 2. 48 %), crude lipid (56. 57 ~ 72. 53 %), crude protein (12. 75 ~ 19. 55 %), and carbohydrate (3. 77 ~ 8. 41 %). Linoleic acid (18 : 2) (46. 26 ~ 55. 25 %) and oleic acid (18 : 1)  (27. 19 ~ 32. 45 %) were the most common components of the fatty acids. All seeds from each treatment contained two essential fatty acids, i. e., linoleic acid and linolenic acid (18 : 3) (12. 78 ~ 14. 21 %). Differences among treatments were detected only in palmitoleic acid (16 : 1) (0. 02 ~ 0. 08 %) and linolenic acid in 2001  and in 8, 11, 14 -eicosatrienoic acid (20 : 3 n 9) in 2000. 5, 9, 12 -pinoleic acid [18 : 3 (γ) ] characteristic to Korean white pine seed was found in every seed. It was concluded that stem-pruning had no influence on general seed component and fatty acid composition. </p...|$|E
