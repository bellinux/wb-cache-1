50|$|Spodoptera littoralis, the <b>African</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm</b> or Egyptian cotton leafworm, is a noctuid moth found {{widely in}} Africa and Mediterranean Europe. It has been {{recorded}} at least six times in the UK, where it {{is also known as}} the Mediterranean Brocade, either an immigrant or as an accidental import. It is often a pest on vegetables, fruits, flowers, and other crops.|$|E
50|$|Like {{plants in}} several other Solanaceae genera, many Jaborosa species contain steroid-derived {{compounds}} called withanolides. Many of the withanolides isolated from Jaborosa have been dubbed jaborosalactones. Some withanolides are phytotoxic, having effects on other plants such as inhibiting germination and radicle growth. Some have antifeedant effects, deterring insects such as mealworms (Tenebrio molitor), the Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata), and the <b>African</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm</b> (Spodoptera littoralis) from consuming the plant.|$|E

40|$|Terpenes are {{important}} defensive compounds against herbivores and pathogens. Here, we report {{the identification of}} a new monoterpene synthase gene, GmNES, from soybean. The transcription of GmNES was up-regulated in soybean plants that were infested with <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm</b> (Prodenia litura), mechanically wounded or treated with salicylic acid (SA). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis revealed that recombinant GmNES enzyme exclusively produced nerol, generated from a newly identified substrate for monoterpene synthase: neryl diphosphate (NPP). This finding indicates that GmNES is a nerol synthase gene in soybean. Subcellular localization using GFP fusions showed that GmNES localized to the chloroplasts. Transgenic tobacco overexpressing GmNES was generated. In dual-choice assays, the GmNES-expressing tobacco lines significantly repelled <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm.</b> In feeding tests with transgenic plants, the growth and development of <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm</b> were significantly retarded. This study confirms the ecological role of terpenoids and provides new insights into their metabolic engineering in transgenic plants...|$|R
30|$|The <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm,</b> Spodoptera littoralis (Boisd.) (Noctuidae), and the bollworms, {{especially}} the pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella Saund.

50|$|Novaluron {{has been}} shown to be highly active against a number of common pests, such as the Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), whiteflies, the <b>African</b> <b>Cotton</b> <b>Leafworm</b> (spodoptera littoralis) and the cotton bollworm. Organisms that are closely related to these animals seem to share this {{susceptibility}} to the compound. A notable exception to this is a study evaluating the efficacy of various insecticides on the stem borers Diatraea saccharalis and Eoreuma loftini, in which the results seemed to indicate that these organisms were not susceptible to novaluron.|$|E
40|$|Although {{the effect}} of {{herbivory}} on plant reproduction has been investigated in some detail, {{little is known about}} how herbivores affect floral signalling. Here, we investigated {{the effect of}} foliar herbivory by the <b>African</b> <b>Cotton</b> <b>Leafworm</b> (Spodoptera littoralis) on floral signalling and fruit set in the White Campion (Silene latifolia). We found no effects of herbivory on floral traits involved in visual signalling (flower number, corolla diameter, calyx length, petal length) or in amount of nectar produced. However, Spodoptera-infested plants emitted higher amounts of the two floral volatiles, (Z) - 3 -hexenyl acetate and β-ocimene, than control plants. Open pollinated, infested plants also were found to produce more fruits than control plants, but only with nocturnal pollinators. Experimental addition of the two induced floral volatiles to non-infested Silene flowers also led to the production of more fruits with nocturnal pollination. This suggests that higher fruit production in herbivore-infested plants was caused by increased nocturnal pollinator attraction, mediated by the induced floral emission of these two volatiles. Our results show that the effects of herbivory on plant reproductive success are not necessarily detrimental, as plants can compensate herbivory with increased investment in pollinator attraction...|$|E
40|$|Multiple {{lepidopteran}} larvae feed successfully {{on plants}} containing glucosinolates despite the {{diverse array of}} toxic and deterrent breakdown products, such as isothiocyanates (ITCs), formed upon plant damage. While much is known about how specialist lepidopterans metabolize and tolerate glucosinolates, there is little information about the metabolic fate of these plant defense compounds in specialized herbivores. Employing 13 C- and 14 C-labeled 4 -methylsulfinylbutyl glucosinolate (glucoraphanin), we identified and quantified the major detoxification products of glucosinolates and ITCs in selected specialized and generalist larvae. While specialists prevented glucosinolate hydrolysis or diverted hydrolysis to form nitriles, hydrolysis in generalists proceeded to toxic ITCs, of which a portion were conjugated to glutathione. However, {{a large amount of}} ITCs remained unmodified, which may have led to the observed negative effects on growth and development. The performance of two generalist-feeding caterpillars, Spodoptera littoralis (<b>African</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm)</b> and Mamestra brassicae (cabbage moth) on Arabidopsis thaliana Col- 0 and various glucosinolate-deficient mutants was investigated from hatching until pupation. We found that glucosinolates negatively affected larval growth and development, but not survival, with aliphatic glucosinolates having stronger effects than indolic glucosinolates, and the combination of the two glucosinolate types being even more detrimental to growth and development. Curiously, last instar larvae grew better on wild type than on non-glucosinolate-containing plant lines, but this could not be attributed to a change in detoxification rate or feeding behavior. Glucosinolates thus appear to be effective defenses against generalist lepidopteran herbivores at least during most stages of larval development. Nevertheless, the reversal of negative effects in the oldest instar is intriguing, and further investigation of this phenomenon may shed light on how generalists adjust their physiology to feed on diets with many different types of plant defense compounds...|$|E

40|$|The {{morphology}} of {{the reproductive}} tract of Podisus nigrispinus (Dallas) females fed with Alabama argillacea (Hübner) larvae, artificial diet, Tenebrio molitor L. larvae or Musca domestica L. larvae were studied. The reproductive tract of females {{of this species}} presented yellow coloration and independent of the diet, each ovary had seven ovarioles joined through terminal filaments and forming a bunch shape structure. The histological data revealed that the ovary of P. nigrispinus was of meroistic telotrophic type, with each individual ovariole divided in a terminal filament, a tropharium (trophic chamber), a vitellarium, and a pedicel. The prey type affected the development and morphometry of these structures. Females of P. nigrispinus fed with 3 rd or 5 th instar larvae of <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm</b> (A. argillacea) presented developed ovaries with ovarioles showing {{a great number of}} oocytes in advanced stages of development. Females fed with artificial diet presented atrophic ovaries and ovarioles practically without oocytes. Females fed with T. molitor or M. domestica showed ovaries in intermediary stage of development. The central ovariole was longer in females fed with 5 th instar larvae of <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm</b> and shorter in those fed with artificial diet.

40|$|Odorant receptors (ORs) {{interface}} {{animals with}} airborne chemical signals. They are under strong selection pressure {{and are therefore}} highly divergent in different taxa. Yet, some OR orthologs are highly conserved. These ORs may be tuned to odorants of broad importance, across species boundaries. Two widely distributed lepidopteran herbivores, codling moth Cydia pomonella (Tortricidae) feeding in apples and pears, and the <b>African</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm</b> Spodoptera littoralis (Noctuidae), a moth feeding on foliage {{of a wide range}} of herbaceous plants, both express a receptor ortholog, OR 19, which shares 58 % amino acid identity and 69 % amino acid similarity. Following heterologous expression in the empty neuron system of Drosophila melanogaster, we show by single sensillum recordings that CpomOR 19 and SlitOR 19 show similar affinity to several substituted indanes. Tests with a series of compounds structurally related to 1 -indanone show that 2 -methyl- 1 -indanone, 2 -ethyl- 1 -indanone, 3 -methyl- 1 -indanone and 1 -indanone elicit a strong response from both ORs. A keto group in position 1 is essential for biological activity and so are both rings of the indane skeleton. However, there is an important difference in steric complementary of the indane rings and the receptor. Methyl substituents on the benzene ring largely suppressed the response. On the other hand, alkyl substituents at position 2 and 3 of the five-membered ring increased the response indicating a higher complementarity with the receptor cavity, in both CpomOR 19 and SlitOR 19. Our results demonstrate a conserved function of an odorant receptor in two moths that are phylogenetically and ecologically distant. It is conceivable that a conserved OR is tuned to signals that are relevant for both species, although their ecological roles are yet unknown. Our finding demonstrates that functional characterization of ORs leads to the discovery of novel semiochemicals that have not yet been found through chemical analysis of odorants from insects and their associated host plants...|$|E
40|$|Among the 1590 {{terrestrial}} arthropod species {{alien to}} Europe {{identified in this}} book, 78 were selected to produce specific factsheets {{in order to provide}} more information on their biology, distribution and impact. We included two more species which are alien in Europe, the horse-chestnut leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella) and the <b>African</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm</b> (Spodoptera littoralis) because of their importance. These 80 species are perhaps not the most important alien invaders, but they are rather representatives of the main taxonomic groups of alien terrestrial arthropods. They were selected so as to represent different pathways of introduction and diverse impacts on ecosystems, economic activities and human and animal health. These species include two myriapods, one spider, one mite, 18 coleopterans, seven dipterans, 23 hemipterans, 10 hymenopterans, one termite, 14 lepidopterans, and three thrips. Each factsheet includes information on the following aspects: Description and biological cycle: A brief description of adults and immature stages is given, whenever possible illustrated by a photograph, to help the reader identify the species. Further information details the general characteristics of the biological cycle in the invaded area, especially the species' potential to reproduce and the hosts it has colonized. Native habitat: The factsheet includes the habitat type where the species is found in its native range. In order to make habitat types comparable among taxa, we adopted the classification of the European Nature Information System (EUNIS) database ([URL] The habitat type codes are detailed in Appendix II. When information was available, we included specific habitat requirements which may help understand the potential of the species to establish and spread in Europe. Habitat occupied in invaded range: The different habitats colonized by the alien species are described as for native habitats. Native range: The native distribution of the species is described. For some species, there is very precise information available, but for others, only brief details of a region or even continent can be given. Introduced range: The date of the first record in Europe and the location of this record is given, as well as details of the process of dispersion in the continent when available. A distribution map is supplied for all species. For most of them, presence/ absence data have been obtained only at country level, but for a few species, more detailed maps are given to show the distribution at regional scale. However, the missing occurrence of species from some countries does not always mean that these countries are not colonized, but may rather result from a lack of data for the country concerned. The map also indicates eradication records where relevant. Pathways: We included information on the routes of introduction to Europe, and the potential of the species to disperse within the continent once it has established. Impact and management: This section details the importance of the species' impacts in the colonized habitats. Both ecological and economical impacts are detailed when known. Practical advice where known is given regarding mechanical, chemical and biological control methods. Selected references: Three of the most relevant references to the history of the species' introduction and spread in Europe are given...|$|E
40|$|Summary Whitefly is {{an insect}} pest that has {{systematically}} spread into colder latitudes {{for the past}} two decades and it poses a serious threat to crops, mainly due to the viruses for which it acts as a vector. As the application of synthetic pesticides is often less effective due to development of resistance or restricted by crop- and country-specific regulations, Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies to combat insect pests become attractive. In this thesis, I discuss the potential of the use of secondary metabolites, particularly sesquiterpenoids, of plant origin, both as sprayed repellents or antifeedants and as part of host plant resistance against whitefly. In Chapter 1, I give {{a detailed description of the}} silverleaf whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, its ecology and its effect on crop yield, taking both direct and indirect damage (caused by the viruses the insect transmits) into account. This chapter also provides a detailed account of pest management strategies, both traditional and emergent, with their advantages and disadvantages. The chapter introduces the reader to plant secondary metabolites, and specifically terpenes, discussing their role in plant ecology and their potential as pest management tools with a low environmental impact. Finally, a short overview of the following chapters is given. Chapter 2 focusses on the antifeedant activity of the drimane sesquiterpene polygodial. This dialdehyde had been described before as antifeedant to a number of insects, such as the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, the <b>African</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm,</b> Spodoptera littoralis, and the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae. In this chapter, the effect of polygodial on the feeding preference of whitefly is reported for the first time. The effect of polygodial was benchmarked against that of the more widely used natural pyrethrins, and both were also tested against M. persicae. From the results, we conclude that pyrethrins were effective against whiteflies at 18 -fold lower concentrations than polygodial (ED 50 of 1. 4 and 25 μg gFW- 1 respectively), while in the case of aphids this difference in efficacy was only two-fold (ED 50 of 28 and 54 μg gFW- 1, respectively). To adopt polygodial as a more persistent and easy to implement pest management strategy, we set out to isolate the genes responsible for its biosynthesis which could then be used to transform crops. As a basis for the selection of the right species and plant tissue to achieve this objective, Chapter 3 describes the chemical composition of one of the sources of polygodial – Persicaria hydropiper (water pepper), as well as of two other congeners (Persicaria minor and Persicaria maculosa). For all three species, GC-MS analysis of extracts of leaves and flowers was performed, which gave insight into the interspecific differences and similarities as well as into the differences between the two tissues. P. hydropiper was the species with the biggest variety and the greatest abundance of secondary metabolites, while P. maculosa had the fewest. The flowers of all species were richer in secondary metabolites compared with the leaves of the same species. Furthermore, the accumulation pattern of the identified compounds throughout the development of flowers and leaves is described. Finally, in this chapter, the possible ecological role of polygodial is also briefly addressed. Chapter 4 focuses on the discovery and characterization of genes involved in the biosynthesis of drimane sesquiterpenoids. Based on the findings of Chapter 3, we used 454 sequencing of a cDNA library constructed from young flowers of P. hydropiper and P. maculosa, for comparison, to identify a drimenol synthase (PhDS) and a drimenol oxidase (PhDOX 1) which can convert farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into drimenol and an array of other sesquiterpenoids when working in concert. Of the compounds produced in the heterologous systems used (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Nicotiana benthamiana), two were identified as drimendiol and cinnamolide. The latter was purified and tested against whiteflies and aphids as described for polygodial in Chapter 2. Cinnamolide also displayed antifeedant activity against both insects, although with at slightly lower efficacy than polygodial. In the heterologous hosts used, no polygodial was detected amongst the products of the enzymatic activity of the two genes studied in this chapter. The potential reasons for this are explored in the discussion section of this chapter. Chapter 5 focuses on the volatile zingiberene, member of the bisabolane family of sesquiterpenes. This compound and its enantiomer, 7 -epi-zingiberene have both been previously identified as repellent to whiteflies. In this chapter we used Alaska yellow cedar (Callitropsis nootkatensis) as a possible source of a zingiberene synthase, which we wanted to use a primary line of defence against whitefly next to polygodial, which would be a secondary line of defence. Alaska yellow cedar produces curcumene in some of its tissues, and this metabolite is known to be a dehydrogenation product of zingiberene. An EST from a C. nootkatensis cDNA library with homology to sesquiterpene synthases was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The resulting protein converted FPP to zingiberene as the sole product. This enzyme was therefore named zingiberene synthase (CnZIS). Although no strict correlation was found between the expression levels of CnZIS in Alaska yellow cedar tissues and the accumulation of curcumene in the same tissues, those with high CnZIS expression such as leaves also produced high amounts of curcumene, while heartwood neither expressed the gene nor had detectable levels of curcumene. Subsequently, we tested the effect of transiently expressed CnZIS in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) on whiteflies. Except for one time point, the effect of zingiberene on whitefly feeding was negligible, likely due to the fact that only trace amounts of zingiberene were emitted. When genes upstream of CnZIS in the biosynthetic pathway – 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) and farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPS) – were co-expressed in tobacco, the antifeedant effect on whiteflies became very strong; however, there was still no detectable level of zingiberene emitted. Instead, the emission of the tobacco sesquiterpene, 5 -epi-aristolochene, was almost 100 -fold higher than in the control, not expressing HMGR and FPS. We discuss potential explanations of this phenomenon, as well as the uncommon outcome of having an endogenous sesquiterpene boosted by the co-expression and redirection to the mitochondria of the three genes of the zingiberene biosynthetic pathway. Chapter 6 brings all the findings together, discussing their place within a wider scientific perspective and their potential in the frame of IPM. Advantages as well as drawbacks of the use of GM crops are addressed. Finally, the emerging new agricultural paradigm, of a sustainable way of growing crops with less environmental impact compared with the current intensive industrial approach, is brought forth as a broad spectrum solution to most agricultural problems which arose in parallel to the intensification of agriculture that stemmed from the Green revolution...|$|E

40|$|Many {{problems}} of agricultural production {{can be understood}} and solved only by understanding the overall production systems {{of which they are}} parts.

The main control methods now used against this insect are hand-picking of egg-masses and aerial spraying of pesticides. Both are intensive, and little increase in their efficiency is possible. The structure of the cropping system is such that relatively minor alterations in the crop rotation may have a marked impact on leafworm population dynamics at relatively low cost. The technical issues involved in these alterations are well within the realms of possibility. But to implement them would require the development of a comprehensive view of the agricultural production system as a whole, a high sensitivity to the needs and decision-making frameworks of the Egyptian fellah, and an understanding of the biology of the <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm...</b>|$|R

40|$|Odors are {{essential}} in mediating insect reproductive behavior. Environmental odors help insects locate suitable feeding or egg-laying sites and avoid suboptimal hosts or dangerous habitats. Sex pheromones, {{on the other}} hand, are responsible for mate finding and elicit courtship and mating. Although pheromones elicit stereotypical behaviors on their own, they are embedded in a background of environmental odors in nature. Using the <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm,</b> Spodoptera littoralis, and the common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, I studied the effect of blending environmentally relevant odors with pheromones on insect behavior. For the <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm,</b> we first developed an attractive cotton volatile blend. We next used this blend to determine the physiological effect of DMNT, a strong behavioral antagonist, on the <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm</b> olfactory system. I then blended the individual volatiles and volatile blends with an incomplete and complete pheromone. The combination of cotton volatiles and the complete pheromone elicits attraction. Deviations from this optimum, either by changing the pheromone composition or the cotton volatile blend strongly reduces male S. littoralis attraction. I then used the fruit fly to study the effect of food (vinegar) and habitat (yeast) volatiles on fly attraction towards pheromones. Starvation affects attraction towards a blend of vinegar and a male produced pheromone in a sexually dimorphic way. We next describe a novel female fruit fly pheromone and the odorant receptor involved in its perception. Finally, we show that vinegar and yeast volatiles interact in a different manner with male and female produced pheromones, suggesting that although vinegar is a good feeding cue, even {{in the presence of}} pheromones, it is not an appropriate mate finding cue. My findings suggest that pheromones and host volatiles function as a single unit that mediates insect behavior, rather than as individual components. As such the olfactory cues that mediate mate finding in insects are under both natural and sexual selection simultaneously, which has strong implications for insect speciation and evolution...|$|R

O crescimento populacional do curuquerê-do-algodoeiro, estimado após quatro gerações sucessivas, mostrou que uma fêmea fertilizada tem capacidade de produzir 1. 776, 6, 47, 19 e 6, 51 indivíduos em Acala 90, BRS Verde e BRS 201, respectivamente. O menor desempenho no desenvolvimento e na reprodução do curuquerê, criado na cultivar BRS 201, é importante no controle desta praga no campo. The aim of {{this work}} was to evaluate the developmental rates and reproductive output of the <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm</b> [Alabama argillacea (Hübner) ], fed on leaves of cultivars with white fibers (BRS 201 and Acala 90) and colored ones (BRS Verde). The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design, with three treatments (cultivars) and ten and eight replications in laboratory and in field, respectively. In the laboratory, larvae were fed with cotton leaves, while in the field, eggs were caged on plant terminals and monitored until one generation was completed. Compared to the other cultivars, BRS 201 caused, both in laboratory and in the field: prolongation of larval development of A. argillacea in about two days; and lower pupal weight and egg production. In laboratory, the <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm</b> reared on BRS 201 showed the lower survival index (46 %). Population growth of A. argillacea estimated after four successive generations showed that one fertilized female {{has the potential for}} producing 1, 776. 6, 47. 19 and 6. 51 individuals colonizing Acala 90, BRS Verde and BRS 201, respectively. Lower performance in development and reproduction of <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm</b> fed on BRS 201 can offer additional control to this pest in the field...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm,</b> Spodoptera littoralis (Boisduval), was {{collected}} from commercial cotton production fields in Adana, Turkey, and tested for susceptibility to the insecticide spinosad. The susceptibility {{of the field}} strain was also compared to the susceptible strain (S) of S. littoralis. Lethal dose bioassays were performed with third instar larvae using the leaf dip method. The LC 50 values for field and susceptible strains were 43. 691 and 10. 037 ppm, respectively. When LC 50 values and 95 % confidence intervals were compared with a susceptible laboratory reference strain, the field strain was approximately 4. 4 -fold less sensitive than the susceptible strain. The present study suggests that spinosad is potentially important in the control of S. littoralis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Defensins are a {{well known}} family of {{cationic}} antibacterial peptides (AMPs) isolated from fungi, plants, insects, mussels, birds, and various mammals. They are predominantly active against gram (+) bacteria, {{and a few}} of them are also active against gram (-) bacteria and fungi. All insect defensins belonging to the invertebrate class have a consensus motif, C-X 5 - 16 -C-X 3 -C-X 9 - 10 -C-X 4 - 7 -CX 1 -C. Only seven AMPs have already been found in different lepidopteran species. No report was published on the isolation of defensin from the Egyptian <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm,</b> Spodoptera littoralis. Results An anionic defensin, termed Spli Def, was isolated from the haemolymph of the <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm,</b> S. littoralis, after bacterial challenge using differential display technique. Based on sequence analyses of the data, specific primers for full length and mature peptide of defensin were designed and successfully amplified 471 and 150 bp amplicons. The integration of the results revealed that the 471 bp-PCR product has one open reading frame (orf) of 303 bp long, including both start codon (AUG) and stop codon (UGA). The deduced peptide consists of a 23 -residues signal peptide, a 27 -residues propeptide and a 50 -residues mature peptide with the conserved six-cysteine motif of insect defensins. Both haemolymph and expressed protein exhibited antibacterial activities comparable to positive control. The RT-qPCR indicated that it was more than 41 -folds up-regulated at 48 h p. i. Conclusion Our results highlight an important immune role of the defensin gene in Spodoptera littoralis by cooperating with other AMPs to control bacterial infection. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{toxicity}} of neem oil; jojoba oil; peppermint oil; garlic oil and ginger oil essential oil were evaluated against the immature {{stages of the}} <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm,</b> Spodoptera littoralis, field strain in comparison with conventional insecticide cyhalothrin. The results showed that cyhalothrin was the most potent compound followed by neem oil, and jojoba oil and the least three materials were peppermint oil; garlic oil, and ginger oil. Tested compounds, cyhalothrin at 15. 0 ppm achieved 31. 9 % mortality of treated egg masses, while neem oil; jojoba oil; peppermint oil; garlic oil and ginger oil at the same concentration caused 89. 0; 75. 9; 59. 6; 53. 5, and 51. 0 % mortality, respectively. The {{toxicity of}} tested compounds were evaluated against newly hatched larvae at 24, and 48 hrs, post treatment. The results showed that cyhalothrin; neem oil and jojoba oil were the more potent than peppermint oil; garlic oil and ginger oil. Cyhalothrin and tested essential oils gave not exhibited any toxic action against pupae of S. littoralis. The interactions of cyhalothrin with tested essential oils in vivo on the inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase was investigated. Results proved that pretreated of neem oil, and jojoba oil with cyhalothrin increased the percentage inhibition for Na+,K+-ATPase to 91. 4, and 88. 3 % respectively. Results proved that the five essential oils mixed with pyrethroid insecticide, (cyhalothrin), caused more toxic effect than single treatment, the present results proved that the five essential oils are potent for control of <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm,</b> the neem oil, and jojoba oil, resulted in more effect than peppermint oil; garlic oil, and ginger oil.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the timing of calling behavior in the female Egyptian <b>cotton</b> <b>leafworm,</b> Spodoptera littoralis and its modification by exposure to sex pheromone. The calling rhythm of the female moth {{was found to be}} circadian, persistent for at least 4 days once it has been entrained, and could be phase shifted by altering the light:dark regime. We also found that female exposure to pheromone affected the rate and duration of calling. A brief exposure to pheromone gland extract increased the proportion of females calling in a constant dim light and this effect persisted for at least 2 days. In response to pheromone exposure, significantly more females also called late into scotophase when most unexposed control females had ceased calling. The adaptive significance of responding to conspecific sex pheromone is discussed...|$|R
