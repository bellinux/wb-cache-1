The prototypes were furnished with long nose-mounted instrumentation booms, these were replaced on the Kestrel with a much smaller counterpart on the vertical stabilizer to enable the nose to accommodate a tactical camera instead.

5|$|Traditionally the Australian Army had {{relied on}} its major allies to provide {{logistic}} support, primarily raising combat units rather than support arms {{during times of}} conflict. Consequently, these services were relatively underdeveloped, and they remained so during {{the first years of}} the war. While British units provided many logistic and line of communication services for the AIF in North Africa during the early campaigns in 1940 and 1941, the Army needed to raise extensive support units to support its combat formations in the Pacific following the Japanese entry into the war. As a result, the growth of the support arms and <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> proved dramatic, including many capabilities which the Australian Army had only minimal or no previous experience in maintaining. These units included terminal formations and beach groups responsible for loading and unloading ships, food and petroleum storage and distribution units and several farm units which grew food for troops in remote areas. In addition, with Australia's national support base located well to the rear, in the major cities in the south-east of the country, significant expansion of the Army's transport capabilities was required to move supplies and men to the field force based in northern Australia and New Guinea. Many road transport units were raised to move supplies around Australia, while the Royal Australian Engineers eventually operated a fleet of 1,900 watercraft and three air maintenance companies were formed to load supply aircraft.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a setting where the firm sells a main service (e. g., air travel) and an <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> (e. g., baggage delivery) to {{two types of}} consumers (e. g., business travelers and leisure travelers). We study how the firm’s ability to charge discriminatory main service prices affects its decision of whether to unbundle the <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> from the main service and charge separate prices. Unlike a firm using uniform pricing of main service that unbundles the <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> if the consumers that value the main service higher have a high likelihood of purchasing the <b>ancillary</b> <b>service,</b> a firm using discriminatory pricing of main <b>service</b> unbundles the <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> if the consumers that value the main service higher have a low likelihood of purchasing the <b>ancillary</b> <b>service.</b> Moreover, discriminatory pricing of main service makes unbundling more (less) {{likely to be the}} optimal <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> strategy when consumers’ main <b>service</b> valuations and <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> valuations are negatively (positively) correlated. Finally, we characterize how firms’ use of main service price discrimination and consumers’ valuation structure (i. e., whether the correlation between consumers’ main <b>service</b> valuations and <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> valuations is positive or negative) jointly determine the <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> strategies in an industry...|$|R

40|$|Motivated by airline baggage fees, we {{consider}} a service provider offering a main service (e. g., transporting a person) and an <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> (e. g., transporting a checked bag) {{that an individual}} customer {{may or may not}} need. We ask whether the firm should bundle the two services and post a single price or unbundle them and price the <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> separately. We consider two motivations for unbundling the services. The first focuses on altering consumer behavior to lower the firm’s costs. We assume that providing the <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> is costly but consumers can exert effort {{in order to reduce the}} rate at which the <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> is needed. We show that the firm unbundles and sets the fee for the <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> at the same level the social planner would. Profit maximization thus results in social efficiency. The second rationale for unbundling is segmentation. We assume that there are two segments that differ in the rate at which they use the <b>ancillary</b> <b>service.</b> The optimal contracts impose higher <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> fees on those less likely to use the service. In the airline setting, this would imply that business travelers would face higher baggage fees than leisure travelers. We conclude that the way in which airlines have implemented baggage fees is more consistent with attempts to control consumer behavior than segment customers. 1...|$|R

On the other hand, the <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> consists of: (i) an annual auction where reactive regulation capacity VAR resources are agreed, and (ii) the scheduling and real-time operation of these VAR resources.

The 1st Burma Division and Indian 17th Infantry Division at first had to be controlled directly by the Burma Army headquarters under Hutton.

It had been the responsibility of GHQ India since 1937, but in the early weeks of the war, it was transferred from India to the ill-fated ABDA Command (ABDACOM). ABDA was based in Java, and it was simply impossible for Wavell, the Supreme Commander of ABDA, {{to keep in touch with}} the situation in Burma without neglecting his other responsibilities. Shortly before ABDA was dissolved, responsibility for Burma was transferred back to India. Interactions with the Chinese proved problematic. Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of Nationalist China, was a poor strategist, and the Chinese Army suffered from severe command problems, with orders having to come directly from Chiang himself if they were to be obeyed. The ability of many Chinese commanders was called into question. Finally, the Chinese Army was lacking in the <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> which allow a force to fight a modern war.|$|E

40|$|Artículos en revistasThe {{aim of the}} Spanish {{voltage control}} <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> is the {{minimization}} of the transmission losses while keeping the system away from voltage instability. The latter target can be achieved maintaining an adequate voltage profile in normal operating condition and assuring that generators exhibit enough reactive margins that guarantee that the system voltages will remain under acceptable values in case of contingencies. The service has been designed in Spain to be partially mandatory and partially subject to payment based on market-driven rules and performance evaluation. In the annual time scope, the optional reactive offers submitted by the service suppliers are selected analyzing a number of forecasted scenarios. This paper explains {{the implementation of the}} Spanish voltage control <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> (VCAS) that is provided by generators in the annual time scope. For this purpose, a mixed-integer linear programming optimal power flow (OPF) is used. Reactive bids of generators are modeled within each scenario by modifying the reactive limits of the generators. The use of the proposed OPF in the assignment of the voltage control <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> is explained and illustrated using actual scenarios of the Spanish power system. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Deeper {{deregulation}} {{in power}} supply industry has made reactive power <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> management a critical task to power system operators from both technical and economic perspectives. This paper proposes a practical market-based reactive power <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> management scheme to tackle the challenge. Reactive power <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> procurement and settlement issues are addressed in the paper. Least cost solution is applied to ensure optimal reactive power dispatch when procuring reactive power support. The total minimum reactive cost is separated into two components: one is assigned to the generation side while {{the other to the}} loading side. Cost responsibility of the loading side is recovered from reactive power charge of the reactive loads taking the amount of reactive power and location into account. On the other hand, cost responsibility of the generation side is equitably allocated to generators according to their different obligations of providing reactive power to support their own active power delivery in a transmission grid. Reactive power cost compensation to a generator is based on the incurred cost of its reactive power contribution less the cost of its obligation to support the active power delivery. Reactive OPF formulation is developed as an analysis tool and the validity of the proposed scheme is examined using a modified IEEE 14 -bus system. Department of Electrical Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|To {{solve the}} problem of solar abandoning, which is {{accompanied}} by the rapid development of photovoltaic (PV) power generation, a demonstration of a photovoltaic-battery energy storage system (PV-BESS) power plant has been constructed in Qinghai province in China. However, it is difficult for the PV-BESS power plant to survive and develop with the current electricity price mechanism and subsidy policy. In this paper, a three-part electricity price mechanism is proposed based on a deep analysis of the construction and operation costs and economic income. The on-grid electricity price is divided into three parts: the capacity price, graded electricity price, and <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> price. First, to ensure that the investment of the PV-BESS power plant would achieve the industry benchmark income, the capacity price and benchmark electricity price are calculated using the discounted cash flow method. Then, the graded electricity price is calculated according to the grade of the quality of grid-connected power. Finally, the <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> price is calculated based on the graded electricity price and <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> compensation. The case studies verify the validity of the three-part electricity price mechanism. The verification shows that the three-part electricity price mechanism can help PV-BESS power plants to obtain good economic returns, which can promote the development of PV-BESS power plants...|$|R
