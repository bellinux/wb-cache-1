5|$|The Monbar Hotel {{attack was}} carried out by the GAL, a state-sponsored death squad, on 25 September 1985 in Bayonne, France. The targets were four members of ETA military, whom the Spanish {{government}} believed to be senior figures in the organisation, itself proscribed as <b>a</b> <b>terrorist</b> <b>group</b> in Spain and France. All four people were killed, with a fifth person, apparently unconnected to ETA, injured in the shooting. This represented the deadliest attack carried out by the GAL. Although two of the participants were apprehended shortly after the shooting, controversy surrounded the possible involvement of senior figures in the Spanish police.|$|E
40|$|Violent groups {{sometimes}} invest significant {{resources in}} social work, {{notably in the}} form of charities and NGOs. The present paper models <b>a</b> <b>terrorist</b> <b>group's</b> charities as <b>a</b> means to advertise its cause in order to raise popular support. The analysis explains how different types of organizations arise in equilibrium, depending on government policies. Then, the interaction between <b>a</b> purely <b>terrorist</b> <b>group</b> and <b>an</b> independent local NGO is examined. It is shown that <b>a</b> purely <b>terrorist</b> <b>group</b> always invests in more attacks than an integrated terrorist-charity organization. Furthermore, the latter may have more NGO activity than a separate local NGO. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007 Terrorism, NGOs, Charities,...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThe potential for {{conflict between the}} United States and <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> is {{higher than in the}} recent past. This thesis attempts to understand the underlying causes for {{the rise and fall of}} <b>terrorist</b> <b>groups</b> by developing <b>a</b> theory that explains the evolution of their life cycles. This thesis argues that once organizational issues take priority over instrumental ones terrorism becomes self-defeating and survival threatening for the <b>terrorist</b> <b>group.</b> Since this priority shift occurs as a natural consequence of their internal dynamics. the seeds of <b>a</b> <b>terrorist</b> <b>group's</b> destruction exist within the group itself. Factors external to the <b>terrorist</b> <b>group.</b> however, can suppress the germination of those seeds and allow the group to survive. The dynamic interaction of these internal and external influences shapes <b>a</b> <b>terrorist</b> <b>group's</b> life cycle. Understanding the nature of this process is important for the design of counterterrorist policy. U. S. Navy (USN) autho...|$|R

5|$|Two millennia ago, humans {{developed}} spyrix, a {{power source}} which absorbs spirits to supply power. In response, the spirit Maxwell gathered humans, {{who share a}} symbiotic relationship with spirits, onto an isolated land protected by a barrier; the isolated land became known as Rieze Maxia and the outer lands as Elympios. As spirits are needed to sustain nature, Maxwell waits for the day all humans on Elympios die off before dispelling the barrier.
