5|$|To {{write his}} own batch of songs, Farrar looked through {{several of the}} over 3,000 {{handwritten}} lyrics that Guthrie's estate has preserved before incidentally focusing on his California period. The connection to Guthrie's Los Angeles years was accidental—Farrar simply chose lyrics that he found compelling and Nora pointed out that they came from a relatively brief period of her father's life when he lived in Los Angeles. He also made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> write instrumentation in a style more similar to Guthrie's than other tribute projects, such as The Klezmatics' klezmer-based Woody Guthrie's Happy Joyous Hanukkah and Wonder Wheel. Farrar had never listened to the Bragg and Wilco material to ensure that his songwriting would not be influenced by it.|$|E
5|$|West made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> {{abstain from}} the {{widespread}} recording practice of excessive rap albums saturated with skits and filler and instead comprised Graduation with significantly fewer tracks. He also chose {{to scale back}} on the guest appearances, limiting himself to just one single guest rap verse on the entire studio album. The stylistic divergence and desire for a leaner, more economical studio album was a creative reaction that was {{brought on by the}} alternative rock and indie-rock that West had been listening to {{around the time of the}} recording of his third studio album. West cites the rock bands The Killers, Keane, Modest Mouse, and indie-pop singer-songwriter Feist, whom he also looked towards for songwriting inspiration, for being among his favorite musicians and having considerably profound influence on the sound of Graduation. Largely due to all this and the inclusion of the layered electronic synthesizers, West believed that his record took hip-hop in a different direction. But he also acknowledged the fact that the differences did not right away and without a doubt make Graduation a good album. However, he felt it was a representation of the music he was listening to at that time.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the demographic trend of longer lifespans and an expanding older market, and to its child-centered image, McDonald's made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> attempt to market its food to a more adult audience. Rather than change its existing menu items or marketing strategy, the company decided {{to create a new}} line of sandwiches with what would hopefully be perceived as more sophisticated ingredients.

25|$|In 1989, Loung {{graduated}} from high school, and in the fall, she entered Saint Michael's College with the financial assistance of a full four-year scholarship provided by the Turrell Scholarship Fund. During her college years, she made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> become an activist, and met her future husband. In early 1992, Loung studied at Cannes International College as part of Saint Michael's curriculum. During that time, she was reunited with her youngest brother Kim, who had fled Cambodia to Thailand and was brought to France via Germany {{with the help of}} his Aunt Heng in 1985.

25|$|After the Children of God album, Gira professed himself tired {{with the}} band's fearsome {{reputation}} for noise, feeling that their audience now had expectations {{that he had}} no intention of fulfilling. He made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> tone down the band's sound, introducing more acoustic elements and increasingly emphasizing Jarboe as a singer. The first results of this shift in direction were the two records recorded by Gira and Jarboe under the names Skin (in Europe) and World of Skin (in the US). The first, Blood, Women, Roses, featured Jarboe on lead vocals, and the second, Shame, Humility, Revenge, featured Gira on lead vocals. Both were recorded together in 1987, although Shame, Humility, Revenge was not released until 1988. These albums are full of slow, ethereal, melancholy, dirge-like songs, sounding like stripped down acoustic versions of the Children of God songs.|$|E

25|$|If one accepts that Shakespeare made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> use Holinshed more {{frequently}} during his re-editing of True Tragedy, one must ask why {{he may have}} done so. True Tragedy is roughly one thousand lines shorter than 3 Henry VI, and whilst many of the differences are simple aesthetic changes and alternate phraseology (much of which is easily attributable to inaccurate reporting), one major {{difference between the two}} that runs throughout is how they each handle violence. On the whole, 3 Henry VI is far more restrained in its depiction of war, whereas True Tragedy has more explicit and sustained on-stage combat and more royal processions and celebrations after combat. Much more so than does 3 Henry VI, True Tragedy conforms to the so-called Tudor myth that the Wars of Roses were God's punishment for people straying from the path laid out for them, and His means of purging the country of evil and opening the way for the righteous Tudor dynasty to establish peace. Traditionally, this has been a common way of interpreting the entire octalogy; advocated and elaborated upon by critics as diverse as August Wilhelm Schlegel, Hermann Ulrici, Georg Gottfried Gervinus, Irving Ribner, M.M. Reese, Robert Rentoul Reed, and, most famously, E.M.W. Tillyard, with whom the phrase Tudor myth is now most associated.|$|E

Following this, the artist experienced a period during which she struggled to find motivation to make music. She eventually found initial inspiration {{for the creation of}} a new album in reading about her namesake, the Hindu goddess Matangi, following which she travelled to India to research concepts for the album.

500|$|As Northern Wei {{became more}} {{economically}} dependent on agriculture, the Xianbei emperors made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> adopt Chinese customs, including passive methods of frontier defence. In 423, a defence line over 2,000 li (...) long {{was built to}} resist the Rouran; its path roughly followed the old Zhao wall from Chicheng County in Hebei Province to Wuyuan County, Inner Mongolia. In 446, 100,000 men were put to work building an inner wall from Yanqing, passing south of the Wei capital Pingcheng, and ending up near Pingguan on the eastern bank of the Yellow River. The two walls {{formed the basis of}} the double-layered Xuanfu–Datong wall system that protected Beijing a thousand years later during the Ming dynasty.|$|E

50|$|However, due to {{significant}} amounts {{of violence in the}} film, director Yee made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> not <b>to</b> release the film in mainland China.

500|$|The Bala Kanda of the Ramayana is the {{earliest}} text to describe Ahalya's seduction in detail. It states that Indra becomes enamoured by Ahalya's beauty, learns of her husband's absence {{and comes to}} the ashram disguised as Gautama to request sexual intercourse with her, praising her as a shapely and slim-waisted woman. She sees through his disguise, but consents owing to her [...] "curiosity". According to another interpretation, Ahalya's pride in her beauty compels her. Having satiated his lust, Ahalya requests that Indra, her [...] "lover" [...] and the [...] "best of gods", flee and protect them from Gautama's wrath. The Kathasaritsagara (11th century CE) {{is one of the}} few texts that mirror the Bala Kandas Ahalya, who makes <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> accept Indra's advances. However, in this text Indra arrives undisguised.|$|E
500|$|The Super Furry Animals made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> make a commercial-sounding [...] "pop jukebox" [...] {{record with}} 1999's Guerrilla. The band {{had written the}} album's {{intended}} singles {{with the hope that}} they would become [...] "radio hits", and were disappointed with the limited success they received: the first single, [...] "Northern Lites", charted just outside the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart at number 11, while subsequent releases [...] "Fire in My Heart" [...] and [...] "Do or Die" [...] reached numbers 25 and 20, respectively. The band blamed their record label, Creation, for the relative failure of the singles—particularly [...] "Northern Lites", which they felt [...] "could have been bigger" [...] if the label had produced a better music video and conducted a more successful marketing campaign. As a result, the group became tired of playing [...] "chart games" [...] and went on [...] "pop strike", deciding to release music just [...] "for the joy of it", with no agenda.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{conceived}} as a [...] "rowdy pop record", both in response to Rough Trade's request for [...] "one of those pop records like you used to make" [...] {{and as a result}} of the [...] "very different atmosphere" [...] the band encountered at shows on the Love Kraft tour when the 'slow' songs from that album were played. In contrast with many Super Furry Animals albums, no samplers were used during recording of Hey Venus! as the group made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> create a [...] "simple record" [...] which [...] "capture the spirit of the band playing live in a room". Dave Newfeld took over production duties from Mario Caldato Jr., who had worked on both Phantom Power and Love Kraft, as the band didn't want to [...] "repeat [...] past two records". As with Love Kraft, all members of the band contributed songs at the recording stage but, besides chief songwriter Gruff Rhys, only guitarist Huw Bunford ("Battersea Odyssey") and keyboard player Cian Ciaran ("Carbon Dating") ended up with their tracks on the finished album.|$|E
500|$|Sixteen {{songs were}} {{recorded}} for the album with only 11 making the final cut. The band made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> keep {{the number of}} tracks, and therefore the running time of Hey Venus!, down [...] "because the last three albums have been almost an hour long". At just over 36 minutes, the album is the shortest full-length release by the band. Some of the songs left off the record were [...] "really heavy and raw" [...] {{as a result of}} which Gruff Rhys feels Hey Venus! is [...] "more consistent with our back catalogue". Both lead single [...] "Show Your Hand" [...] and [...] "Suckers!" [...] were originally cut from the album, for being [...] "too generic" [...] and too [...] "obvious ... melodically" [...] respectively, until the band were persuaded to reconsider. Rough Trade Records boss Geoff Travis told the group that [...] "Show Your Hand" [...] was his favourite song and, following the tracks reworking to include a French horn part, it was reinstated. Similarly [...] "Suckers!" [...] was [...] "really pushed" [...] by producer Dave Newfeld until it too took its place on Hey Venus!.|$|E
500|$|Some {{hardcore}} punk bands made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> avoid putting Reagan {{in their}} lyrics. In wanting his music to outlast the administration, [...] Washington, D.C. musician Ian MacKaye, {{who was in}} the bands Minor Threat, Embrace, Pailhead, and Fugazi during the Reagan years, has said, [...] "I remember clearly resisting the urge to put the word 'Reagan' in any of the songs". In the late 1980s U.S. skinheads spearheaded a patriotic right-wing faction within the New York hardcore scene, and although bands like Agnostic Front and Cro Mags did not reference the president directly in their lyrics, their support of Reagan fell within their interpretation of patriotic backlash that reimagined hardcore without the antiestablishment ethos of punk rock. Some groups' stances on the president were a bit more ambiguous. When the drunk-rock group Murphy's Law praised Reagan and his films in their 1986 song [...] "California Pipeline," [...] fans could take it as either actual pro-Republican patriotism, or a tongue-in-cheek take on anti-Reagan irony. By the late 1980s, reference to Reagan in hardcore music had become so commonplace that the joke was no longer on the president, but on a punk scene where bands were practically obliged to put a Reagan song on their setlist or album.|$|E

This effort resulted in the Asahiflex I, which {{was also the first}} Japanese 35mm SLR.|$|R

500|$|Welling {{was cast}} in the WB superhero drama Smallville after a {{nationwide}} search for an actor to play Clark Kent. In {{an interview with a}} teen magazine, Welling spoke about the day he auditioned for the role: [...] "I was on my way back from the Warner Bros. studio, and I stopped in a gas station to call my manager and tell him how it went. I called and got him on the phone and he said, 'Can you hold on a second?' Next thing I know, there are literally seven people on the other line and almost in unison they say, 'Tom, you got it!'" [...] The pilot aired in October 2001 and became the highest rated debut for The WB, with 8.4 million viewers. Welling told TV Guide that he turned down the lead role twice, but after reading the script, decided to take the job. Like Christopher Reeve, he was not a Superman fan prior to being cast as Clark Kent. In fact, he said, he continues to not read Superman comics: [...] "I made <b>a</b> <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> stay away from that material. We're doing something different at a time before all that, I don't want that to affect what I'm doing, even subconsciously." [...] He did get the chance to meet two previous Superman actors: Christopher Reeve, who appeared in season 2: episode 17 titled [...] "Rosetta", and Dean Cain, who appeared in season 7: episode 4 titled [...] "Cure".|$|E

40|$|Although many {{fairy tales}} feature small {{characters}} or things, Marie-Catherine d’Aulnoy’s {{evocation of the}} small {{is not just a}} consequence of her tales’ small scale but rather <b>a</b> self- <b>conscious</b> <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> examine and exploit the limits of the genre. Although d’Aulnoy sometimes associates the small with deformity or inferiority, most often she evokes small things to admire their delicate beauty. I argue that in her descriptions of small objects, especially toys and jewels, d’Aulnoy celebrates the skill with which they have been made in a self-reflexive move that ascribes new value to her artfully crafted tales...|$|R
