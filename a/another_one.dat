5|$|In 2012, DeMarco {{went back}} to {{recording}} as a solo artist and was signed by Captured Tracks. They released his EP Rock and Roll Night Club in early 2012; it received positive reviews from contemporary music critics. His second studio album, 2, followed later the same year. 2 was met with critical acclaim and peaked at number 26 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. It was followed by DeMarco’s third studio album, Salad Days in 2014. Salad Days was also praised by critics and peaked at number 90 on the UK Albums Chart, and number 30 on the Billboard 200. DeMarco released an EP titled Some Other Ones and the mini-LP <b>Another</b> <b>One</b> {{in the summer of}} 2015. <b>Another</b> <b>One</b> was met with positive reviews and peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart.

5|$|An ossuary and a {{mausoleum}} were erected on {{the site}} of the massacre in 1955, as was a monument by the sculptor Vojin Bakić.

The ruins of the ossuary were removed by the local authorities in 2002. That same year, residents signed a petition to have the Bjelovarac monument erected once again.

5|$|Another example, is the Junta Administradora del Acueducto La Sirena en el Valle del Cauca (Water Board La Sirena) in {{the southwestern}} {{outskirts}} of Cali, which manages 778 residential connections, offering continuous service to some 4,200 users. It operates a sewerage system and a wastewater treatment plant. Water consumption is metered. The average monthly tariff is US$3.5 for 28m3. There is no social stratification, but special tariffs are applied to those users who consume more than 28m3. The annual cash surplus is about US$10,000 which is reinvested in preventive maintenance {{and in some cases}} in construction works. In this way, in the last 3years a water capture facility was constructed in Quebrada Epaminondas, <b>another</b> <b>one</b> at Melendez River was improved, and a water tank with a capacity of 220m3 was constructed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>one</b> of Heffron's {{election}} promises, namely a Royal Commission {{into the}} legalisation of off-course betting, caused considerable tension {{with his own}} cabinet. His Attorney General Reg Downing favoured its legalisation through a government-supervised Totalisator Agency Board (TAB) while his Chief Secretary Gus Kelly favoured legalising the activities of existing SP bookmakers. Downing however, went over Heffron's head and procured an ALP State Executive order requiring {{the establishment of a}} TAB. When the Final Report of Commission was handed down on 29 March 1963, echoing the position of Downing, Heffron was obliged to carry out the establishment of the TAB.|$|E

Veltmann responded that this line of evidence was news to him, too. The next day, Coakley gave the press a statement accusing Veltmann of coaching McPherson.|$|E

5000|$|Church {{attendance}} {{is a central}} religious practice for many Christians; some Christian denominations, such as the Catholic Church require church attendance on the Lord's Day (Sunday); the Westminster Confession of Faith is held by the Reformed Churches and teaches first-day Sabbatarianism, thus proclaiming the duty of public worship {{in keeping with the}} Ten Commandments. Similarly, The General Rules of the Methodist Church also requires [...] "attending upon all the ordinances of God" [...] including [...] "the public worship of God". The government of the United Kingdom formerly required attendance at church services of the Church of England (the mother Church of the Anglican Communion and a state Church) at least twice a year. To this end, all major branches of Christianity, however, encourage church attendance, with one Christian apostolate providing the following biblical imperatives: [...] The Bible tells us we need to attend church so we can worship God with other believers and be taught His Word for our spiritual growth ( [...] ; [...] ). Church is the place where believers can love <b>one</b> <b>another</b> (...) , encourage <b>one</b> <b>another</b> (...) , [...] "spur" [...] <b>one</b> <b>another</b> (...) , serve <b>one</b> <b>another</b> (...) , instruct <b>one</b> <b>another</b> (...) , honor <b>one</b> <b>another</b> (...) , and be kind and compassionate to <b>one</b> <b>another</b> (...) [...] The Lutheran Christian theologian Balthasar Münter stated that church {{attendance is}} the [...] "foundation for the Christian life" [...] as [...] "the Christian Bible and the sacraments provide the framework for the faith"; he also states that it is important for believers because it aids in the prevention of backsliding, as well as offers [...] "the company of other believers".|$|R
