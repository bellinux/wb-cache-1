In spite of the disagreements, the duo <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to patch things up {{for the benefit of the}} station and their listeners.|$|E

25|$|According to Neville Cardus, Tyldesley {{was one of}} the {{greatest}} of Lancashire batsmen. Cardus agreed with Wisden that Tyldesley was exceptionally quick on his feet and therefore <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to have plenty of time in which to play his strokes. Tyldesley was very strong, despite his small size, with quick reflexes and great flexibility in his wrists which assisted both his strokeplay and, when fielding, his throwing. He was especially noted as a batsman for his mastery of the square cut and his fighting qualities in difficult conditions; he played many noted innings on bad wickets.|$|E
25|$|Foreman was {{sometimes}} {{characterized by the}} media as an aloof and antisocial champion. According to them, he <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to wear a sneer and was not often available to the press. Foreman later attributed his demeanor during this time as an emulation of Sonny Liston, for whom {{he had been an}} occasional sparring partner. Foreman defended his title successfully twice during his initial reign as champion. His first defense, in Tokyo, pitted him against Puerto Rican Heavyweight Champion José Roman. Roman was not regarded as a top contender, and it took Foreman only 2 minutes to end the fight, one of the fastest knockouts in a Heavyweight Championship bout.|$|E
25|$|A few Indians {{played as}} members of the English cricket team while India was under British rule, {{including}} Ranjitsinhji and KS Duleepsinhji, but India made its debut as a Test-cricket-playing-nation in England in 1932 led by CK Nayudu, well before Indian independence. The team performed well, with Mohammad Nissar taking 5-93 and 1-42 in the match against England. The match was given test status despite being only 3 days in length. England, batting first, scored 258 with Nissar cleaning up the openers and tailenders. However the Indian team failed to capitalize on their bowling performance, all out for 189 with CK Nayudu the top scorer with 40 runs. England went on to score 275 and set India a target of 346, which <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> out of the visitor's grasp. India were all out for 187 and lost by 158 runs.|$|E

25|$|On March 20 8th-seeded Cincinnati and 9th-seeded Purdue {{squared off}} in the game prior to Kentucky and Hampton playing. The Bearcats outlasted the Boilermakers 66 to 65 in overtime. On March 22 Cincinnati and Kentucky met in Louisville for a berth to the Sweet 16. This was the first meeting between the two {{programs}} since the 2005 NCAA Tournament in which Kentucky won. The game was not as easy for the Wildcats like {{it was in the}} opening round game against Hampton. Kentucky shot just 37 percent and was outrebounded 45 to 38 yet <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> in control because of timely baskets and rebounds that Cincinnati failed to get. The physical, pesky Bearcats made the Wildcats work hard for every shot and rebound in an intense contest. Yet the Wildcats succeeded by making life difficult on both ends for Cincinnati, holding the Bearcats to 32 percent shooting including just 24 percent in the second half. Kentucky blocked six shots after halftime and nine overall while also coming up with key rebounds. Kentucky outlasted Cincinnati's physicality, defeating the Bearcats 64 to 51 en route to the Sweet 16.|$|E
25|$|On September 9, 1864, the 19th New York Cavalry was {{transfer}} to the second brigade of Brig. Gen. Thomas C. Devin. The volunteers welcomed this move because the soldiers of the Regular regiments had fled from the field {{on more than one}} occasion and <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to get undeserved credit for actions won or carried by the volunteers, as Bowen and other writers from the volunteer ranks such as Capt. R. A. Britton, who is quoted by Bowen, observed. On September 19, 1864, Sheridan's forces attacked Early's forces at the Battle of Opequon or Third Battle of Winchester. The 19th New York Cavalry struck the Confederate outposts on the Opequon Creek at Sewer's Ford, about seven miles northeast of Winchester, Virginia. Captain Alexander K. Thorp, brother of the regiment's Lt. Col. Thomas Thorp, who had been taken prisoner at Trevilian Station, was killed near the beginning of this battle. At a key point in the battle, Devin sent his entire division charging into the Confederate infantry's line of battle inflicting a great number of casualties, including the taking of many prisoners. Devin wrote that Gibbs led his regiment in gallant style. The cavalry charges sent the remaining Confederate infantry fleeing from the field.|$|E

Some of these had been associates in his county executive days, such as Lester Matz and Walter Jones, who had been {{among the first to}} encourage him to seek the governorship. Agnew's close ties to the business community were noted by officials in the state capital of Annapolis: [...] "There <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to be people around him who were in business."

[...] Shiban argued that the concept also worked because the theme of Mulder questioning his beliefs was a major element of the fifth season.

500|$|Mayberry {{made the}} Phillies' opening day roster {{for the first}} time, and {{recorded}} the game-winning RBI via a pinch hit single in the Phillies' first game, but was optioned back to the minors after the Phillies activated Shane Victorino from the disabled list in early June. Subsequently, Mayberry returned to the big-league club when Victorino {{went back to the}} disabled list. Throughout 2011, Mayberry did not have a defined role on the club. In August, columnist David Murphy wrote, [...] "While the Phillies may not see evidence that Mayberry should be part of their everyday plans, it is getting hard to ignore the two huge offensive tools he brings to the table: immense power, and a curious ability to hit when it counts." [...] He added, [...] "Charlie Manuel has <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to have a soft spot in his heart for Mayberry. And, more importantly, he has <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to have a knack for when to put him into a game." [...] Manuel compared Mayberry to former Phillie Jayson Werth in terms of their size, athleticism, {{and the fact that they}} both hit better against left-handed pitching than right-handed pitching, noting that he planned to give Mayberry a chance to start if Ben Francisco floundered. Ultimately, the Phillies traded away Francisco after the season, in part due to Mayberry's emergence. He finished the season batting [...]273/.341/.513, with a [...]854 OPS and 15 home runs in 104 games, and made his postseason debut in the National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals that September.|$|E

Epworth watched the first thirteen Bond films seeking the [...] "musical code" [...] of the songs, [...] "whatever the modal structure or the chord that <b>always</b> <b>seemed</b> to unify those songs" [...] and contributed to the mood and [...] "that kind of '60s jazzy quality".
