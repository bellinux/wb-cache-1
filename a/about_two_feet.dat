25|$|The lantern {{at the top}} of the Medici Chapel is {{made out}} of marble and has an “….unusual {{polyhedron}} mounted on the peak of the conical roof,”. The orb that is on top of the lantern has seventy-two facets and is <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>feet</b> in diameter. The orb and cross, that is on top of the orb, are traditional symbols of the Roman and Christian power, and recalls the similar orbs on central dome plan churches like St. Maria del Fiore and St. Peter’s. But because it is on a private mausoleum, the Medici family is promoting their own personal power with the orb and cross, laurel wreath and lion heads, which are all symbols of status and power.|$|E
25|$|The one {{exception}} to the supposed 'look but don't touch'-policy was the so-named boat no. 10, which was slowly appearing due to apparent soil erosion. For five days, archaeologists carefully examined the midsection of the ship. They uncovered wooden planks, disintegrated rope, and reed bundles. Wood-eating ants had reduced much of the ship's hull to frass (ant excrement), but the frass had retained {{the shape of the}} original hull. The midsection of this boat revealed the construction methods used and confirmed the oldest ‘planked’ constructed boat yet discovered. The boat's construction revealed it had been constructed from the outside in, as there was no internal frame. Averaging 75ft long and 7–10ft wide at their greatest width, these boats were only <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>feet</b> deep, with narrow prows and sterns. Several boats were white-plastered, as were the Abydos tombs, and no. 10 was painted yellow.|$|E

25|$|Gein {{admitted}} to stealing from nine graves and led investigators to their locations. Because authorities were uncertain {{as to whether}} the slight Gein was capable of single-handedly digging up a grave during a single evening, they exhumed two of the graves and found them empty (one had a crowbar in place of the body), thus apparently corroborating Gein's confession. Allan Wilimovsky of the state crime laboratory participated in opening three test graves identified by Gein. The caskets were inside wooden boxes; the top boards ran crossways (not lengthwise). The tops of the boxes were <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>feet</b> (60 cm) below the surface in sandy soil. Gein had robbed the graves soon after the funerals while the graves were not completed. They were found as Gein described: One casket was empty, one Gein had failed to open when he lost his pry bar, and most of the body was gone from the third, but Gein had returned rings and some body parts.|$|E
25|$|To {{address these}} issues, Grampus, {{although}} similar in design {{to the traditional}} New England schooner, also differed in significant ways. She had a hull <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>feet</b> (0.6 meter) deeper than traditional schooners of similar length, giving her greater stability. She had a straight stem, rather than a raking one, and her stern was narrower and more raked, with her after portion approximating a V-shape, all changes which increased her hull length at the waterline. Her foremast was considerably shorter than her mainmast, and her rigging was designed {{so that she could}} carry a double-headed rig forward that allowed her to use a smaller jib that could be furled upon the approach of heavy weather and a fore staysail running from the foremast to near her stem. The result was a ship able to achieve higher sailing speeds, able to make more efficient use of her sails, with no need for crew members to work on her bowsprit during bad weather, and less likely to capsize in heavy seas.|$|E
25|$|The {{head was}} {{probably}} relatively large and wide but still elongated. The snout is completely unknown. Frontal bones are absent. The skull roof is rather robust with bosses on the parietals, continuing sideways over the dermopterotica, and the postparietals. The parietals have a notch {{on the front}} midline. A dermosphenoticum is present above the eye socket. The jaws are toothless. Behind the jaw joint a robust hyomandibula is present. The gill basket rests on paired hypohyalia. At least the first two gill arches have ossified hypobranchialia, the lower parts of the gill arch; a third hypobranchiale was likely present. The hypobranchials are attached at their lower ends at an angle of 21,5° via a functional joint that possibly served to increase the gape of the mouth, to <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>feet.</b> All five gill arches have ossified ceratobranchialia with a triangular cross-section, the middle sections of the arches. The hypobranchials are fused with their ceratobranchials. The fifth gill arch is fused with the front parts of the basket. Higher epibranchialia and pharyngobranchialia are present but poorly known. The fourth arches are supported by a midline fourth basibranchiale. An ossified operculum is present.|$|E

500|$|The c.1800 {{manuscript}} {{stated that}} both the honour and {{the very existence of}} Clan MacLeod was thought to have depended upon the preservation of the Fairy Flag. Only the [...] "highest and purest blood of the race" [...] and the most renowned heroes, were selected to guard the flag when it was displayed. These twelve men, with a sword in hand, would stand just behind the chief who was always put in front. One family produced the hereditary keepers of the flag; and of this family, only the eldest living male could unfurl the flag. This family was called [...] "Clan Tormad Vic Vurichie" [...] ("the children of Tormod, son of Murchadh"), and was descended from Sìol Torcaill. The 20th century Hebridean author Alasdair Alpin MacGregor, when writing of the traditions of the flag, stated that the flag's bearers held lands on Skye near Bracadale for their services to the chiefs of Clan MacLeod. The first of the flag bearers from this family was buried within the same grave as the chief of the clan, on the island of Iona. The second, and last bearer, was buried at St Clements Church, in Rodel, on the island of Harris. This man's remains were covered by a magnificent monument; the stone coffin in which his body was placed, was six feet deep. A moveable iron grate rested <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>feet</b> from the lid, and the man's body rested upon the grate. The man's male descendants were also deposited within this coffin. This meant that when a newly deceased was placed within, the bones and dust of the previous occupant were sifted through the grate into the coffin below. The writer of the manuscript stated that in the time of his own father, the last male of this family was interred this way. The tomb was then sealed by this man's daughter. The c.1800 manuscript also noted that this family, prior to its extinction, became miserably poor.|$|E

The German battlecruisers opened fire themselves a few minutes later at 9:11, at a range of , and concentrated their fire on Lion. They first hit her at 9:28 on the waterline with a shell that flooded a coal bunker. Shortly afterwards a [...] shell from Blücher hit the roof of 'A' turret, denting it and knocking out the left gun for two hours. At 9:35 Beatty signalled 'Engage the corresponding ships in the enemy's line', but Tigers captain, believing that Indomitable was already engaging Blücher, fired at , as did Lion, which left [...] unengaged and able to continue to engage Lion without risk. However, Lion scored the first serious hit of the battle when one of her shells penetrated the working chamber of Seydlitzs rear barbette at 9:40 and ignited the propellant lying exposed. The resulting fire spread into the other turret and burnt out both of them, killing 159 men. Seydlitz returned the damage at 10:01 with a [...] shell that ricocheted off the water and pierced Lions five-inch armour aft, although it failed to explode. However, the resulting [...] hole flooded the low power switchboard compartment and eventually shorted out two of Lions three dynamos. [...] scored the most telling hits on Lion at 10:18 when two [...] shells struck her port side below the waterline. The shock was so great that her captain, Ernle Chatfield, thought that she had been torpedoed. One shell pierced the five-inch armour forward and burst in a wing compartment behind the armour. It drove in a [...] piece of armour and flooded a number of compartments adjacent to the torpedo flat and the torpedo body room. One splinter put a hole in the exhaust pipe of the capstan engine which eventually contaminated the auxiliary condenser with salt water. The other shell hit further aft and burst on the six-inch portion of the waterline belt. It drove in two armour plates about [...] and flooded some of the lower coal bunkers. At 10:41 a 283mm shell burst against the eight-inch armour of 'A' barbette, but only started a small fire in the 'A' turret lobby that was quickly put out, although the magazine was partially flooded when a false report was received that it was on fire as well. Soon afterwards Lion was hit by a number of shells in quick succession, but only one of these was serious. A shell burst on the nine-inch armour belt abreast the engine room and drove a [...] armour plate <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>feet</b> inboard and ruptured the port engine's feedwater tank. By 10:52 Lion had been hit fourteen times and had taken aboard some [...] of water which gave her a list of 10° to port and reduced her speed.

60|$|I {{have already}} {{described}} my habitation, {{which was a}} tent under {{the side of a}} rock, surrounded with a strong pale of posts and cables; but I might now rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall up against it of turfs, <b>about</b> <b>two</b> <b>foot</b> thick on the outside; and after some time, I think it was a year and half, I raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock, and thatched or covered it with boughs of trees, and such things as I could get to keep out the rain, which I found at some times of the year very violent.|$|R
