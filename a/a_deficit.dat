5|$|Governments {{do not use}} {{the terms}} profit and loss to {{describe}} the net results of their operations. The difference between revenues and expenditures during a year is either a surplus or <b>a</b> <b>deficit.</b> Since making a profit is not {{the purpose of a}} government, a significant surplus generally means a choice between tax cuts or spending increases. A significant deficit will result in spending cuts or borrowing. Ideally, surpluses and deficits should be small.|$|E

Coleman had previously co-founded Actor's Express in Atlanta, Georgia, and was the {{artistic director}} there. Coleman initially signed on for a three-year contract. Before Coleman began as artistic director with PCS, the company was already the largest live theater production company in Portland. However, the organization was facing sporadic attendance at performances as well as financial difficulties, with <b>a</b> <b>deficit</b> {{at the end of}} 1999 of $700,000. In 2000 PCS had <b>a</b> <b>deficit</b> of $880,000 and a base of 10,000 subscribers. The financial position of the company later stabilized, and Coleman had a 2000 budget of $3.2million to work with when he came on. A 2003 consultant's report, however, found that PCS relied more heavily on gifts and grants to fund its operations than its peers around the company.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>a</b> twin <b>deficit</b> relates to <b>a</b> budget <b>deficit</b> and <b>a</b> current account <b>deficit.</b> In the literature, {{there is no}} unique answer to the {{question}} of what the causal relationship between these deficits is. In any case, the existence of these deficits indicates that the spending of a country is higher than its production and investments are greater than savings. The form of financing could be a potential problem, as well as the manner of the use of these funds. Crisis situations contribute to the increasing importance of the issue. In these situations, those countries where <b>a</b> budget <b>deficit</b> chronically appears and which do not have enough domestic savings to finance excessive government spending will be in a worse position. The Republic of Serbia belongs to the group of countries where <b>a</b> budget <b>deficit</b> is <b>a</b> chronic phenomenon financed by external sources; therefore, the paper will analyze the issue of <b>a</b> twin <b>deficit...</b>|$|R

5|$|A country's {{external}} {{wealth is}} measured by the value of its foreign assets net of its foreign liabilities. A current account surplus (and corresponding financial account deficit) indicates an increase in external wealth while <b>a</b> <b>deficit</b> indicates a decrease. Aside from current account indications of whether a country is a net buyer or net seller of assets, shifts in a nation's external wealth are influenced by capital gains and capital losses on foreign investments. Having positive external wealth means a country is a net lender (or creditor) in the world economy, while negative external wealth indicates a net borrower (or debtor).|$|E

Auditory disorders, when present, aggravate the phonological deficit, hence the literacy impairment. However, auditory deficits cannot be characterised simply as rapid auditory processing problems, as would be predicted by the magnocellular theory. Nor are they restricted to speech. Contrary to the cerebellar theory, we find little support for the notion that motor impairments, when found, have a cerebellar origin, or reflect <b>an</b> automaticity <b>deficit.</b> Overall, the present data support the phonological theory of dyslexia, while acknowledging the presence of additional sensory and motor disorders in certain individuals...|$|R
