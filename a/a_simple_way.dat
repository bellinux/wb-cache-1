5|$|A {{problem with}} early bombsights {{was that they}} could only correct {{for the effects of}} the wind in <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>way</b> and {{required}} the bomber to fly directly up- or down-wind from the target, to minimise the complexity of the required calculations. This made it difficult to attack moving targets and allowed anti-aircraft artillery to sight their weapons along the wind line.|$|E
5|$|Soluble ionic {{compounds}} like salt {{can easily}} be dissolved to provide electrolyte solutions. This is <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>way</b> to control the concentration and ionic strength. The concentration of solutes affects many colligative properties, including increasing the osmotic pressure, and causing freezing-point depression and boiling-point elevation. Because the solutes are charged ions they also increase the electrical conductivity of the solution. The increased ionic strength reduces {{the thickness of the}} electrical double layer around colloidal particles, and therefore the stability of emulsions and suspensions.|$|E

25|$|Approximations for {{the number}} of fixed polyominoes and free polyominoes are related in <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>way.</b> A free polyomino with no symmetries (rotation or reflection) {{corresponds}} to 8 distinct fixed polyominoes, and for large n, most n-ominoes have no symmetries. Therefore, the number of fixed n-ominoes is approximately 8 times the number of free n-ominoes. Moreover, this approximation is exponentially more accurate as n increases.|$|E

By the extreme value theorem, a continuous function on a closed interval must attain its minimum and maximum values at least once. If the function is differentiable, the minima and maxima can only occur at critical points or endpoints.|$|E

25|$|This {{reaction}} {{is known as}} the Hajos-Parrish reaction (also known as the Hajos-Parrish-Eder-Sauer-Wiechert reaction, referring to a contemporaneous report from Schering of the reaction under harsher conditions). Under the Hajos-Parrish conditions only a catalytic amount of proline is necessary (3mol%). There is no danger of an achiral background reaction because the transient enamine intermediates are much more nucleophilic than their parent ketone enols. This strategy offers <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>way</b> of generating enantioselectivity in reactions without using transition metals, which have the possible disadvantages of being toxic or expensive.|$|E
25|$|The LOD score (logarithm (base 10) of odds), {{developed}} by Newton Morton, is a statistical test {{often used for}} linkage analysis in human, animal, and plant populations. The LOD score compares the likelihood of obtaining the test data if the two loci are indeed linked, to the likelihood of observing the same data purely by chance. Positive LOD scores favour the presence of linkage, whereas negative LOD scores indicate that linkage is less likely. Computerised LOD score analysis is <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>way</b> to analyse complex family pedigrees {{in order to determine}} the linkage between Mendelian traits (or between a trait and a marker, or two markers).|$|E
25|$|One major {{drawback}} of the Levins {{model is}} that it is deterministic, whereas the fundamental metapopulation processes are stochastic. Metapopulations are particularly useful when discussing species in disturbed habitats, and the viability of their populations, i.e., how likely they are to become extinct in a given time interval. The Levins model cannot address this issue. <b>A</b> <b>simple</b> <b>way</b> to extend the Levins' model to incorporate space and stochastic considerations is by using the contact process. Simple modifications to this model can also incorporate for patch dynamics. At a given percolation threshold, habitat fragmentation effects take place in these configurations predicting more drastic extinction thresholds.|$|E

25|$|Python's {{property}} descriptors are similar, {{but come}} with a tradeoff in the development process. If one begins in Python by using a publicly exposed instance variable, and later changes the implementation to use a private instance variable exposed through a property descriptor, code internal to the class {{may need to be}} adjusted to use the private variable rather than the public property. Ruby’s design forces all instance variables to be private, but also provides <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>way</b> to declare set and get methods. This is in keeping with the idea that in Ruby, one never directly accesses the internal members of a class from outside the class; rather, one passes a message to the class and receives a response.|$|E
25|$|While American {{citizens}} were generally assured of <b>a</b> <b>simple</b> <b>way</b> {{to leave the}} country just by showing up to an evacuation point, South Vietnamese who wanted to leave Saigon before it fell often resorted to independent arrangements. The under-the-table payments required to gain a passport and exit visa jumped sixfold, and the price of seagoing vessels tripled. Those who owned property in the city were often forced to sell it at a substantial loss or abandon it altogether; the asking price of one particularly impressive house was cut 75 percent within a two-week period. American visas were of enormous value, and Vietnamese seeking American sponsors posted advertisements in newspapers. One such ad read: “Seeking adoptive parents. Poor diligent students” followed by names, birthdates, and identity card numbers.|$|E
