5|$|Breeding {{colonies of}} Atlantic puffins provide <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> {{spectacle}} for both bird watchers and tourists. For example, four thousand puffins nest {{each year on}} islands {{off the coast of}} Maine and visitors can view them from tour boats which operate during the summer months. There is a Project Puffin Visitor Centre in Rockland providing information on the birds and their lives, and on the other conservation projects being undertaken by the National Audubon Society who run the centre. Similar tours operate in Iceland, the Hebrides, and Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|In chronic {{inflammatory}} {{diseases like}} atopic dermatitis (skin), rheumatoid arthritis (joints),…, {{the side effects}} of corticosteroids are problematic because of the necessary long-term treatment. Therefore, SEGRAMs are being investigated as an alternative topical treatment. Systemic long-term treatment of inflammations with corticosteroids is particularly liable to cause metabolic side-effects, which makes the development of oral SEGRAMs <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> goal. It {{remains to be seen whether}} selective receptor agonists or modulators indeed cause significantly less side-effects than classical corticoids in clinical applications.|$|E

Beta Aurigae is <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> variable star in the constellation; Epsilon Aurigae, a nearby eclipsing binary with an unusually long period, has been studied intensively. Because of its position near the winter Milky Way, Auriga has many bright open clusters in its borders, including M36, M37, and M38, popular targets for amateur astronomers. In addition, it has one prominent nebula, the Flaming Star Nebula, associated with the variable star AE Aurigae.|$|E
5|$|Michael Balcon, {{the head}} of Ealing Studios and the {{producer}} of Kind Hearts and Coronets, appointed Robert Hamer as director. Hamer {{was interested in the}} film, and thought it <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> project with possibilities of using the English language in a unique way in the film. Filming took place from September 1948 at Leeds Castle and other locations in Kent, and at Ealing Studios. The themes of class and sexual repression run through the film, particularly love between classes.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics; many felt {{that while the}} episode had <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> theme and {{that much of the}} drama was successful, the humor was too broad or forced. The episode was viewed by 3.44 million viewers and received a 1.8/5 percent rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. The episode ranked fourth in its timeslot, and it was the highest-rated NBC series of the night, though it was lowest rated episode of The Office at the time of airing.|$|E

Miller intended to use Henry's death and rebirth process sporadically after the first two episodes so that the series would focus on Henry's long life.|$|E
