5|$|Uranium metal {{reacts with}} almost all {{non-metal}} elements (with {{the exception of}} the noble gases) and their compounds, with reactivity increasing with temperature. Hydrochloric and nitric acids dissolve uranium, but non-oxidizing acids other than hydrochloric <b>acid</b> <b>attack</b> the element very slowly.

Uranium in ores is extracted chemically and converted into uranium dioxide or other chemical forms usable in industry.|$|E
