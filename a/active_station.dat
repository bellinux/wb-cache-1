40|$|Abstract. Algorithms {{for radio}} {{networks}} are studied in two scenarios: (a) {{the number of}} <b>active</b> <b>stations</b> is known (or approximately known) (b) the number of <b>active</b> <b>stations</b> is unknown. In the second (more realistic) case it is much harder to design efficient algorithms. For this reason, we design an efficient randomized algorithm for a single-hop radio network that approximately counts the number of its <b>active</b> <b>stations.</b> With probability higher than 1 − 1 n, this approximation is within a constant factor, the algorithm runs in poly-logarithmic time and its en-ergy cost is o(log logn). This improves the previous O(logn) bound for energy. In particular, our algorithm {{can be applied to}} improve energy cost of known leader election and initialization protocols (without loss of time efficiency). ...|$|R

2500|$|The oldest [...] station building, the Long-A-Coming Depot, {{built in}} 1856, {{and the oldest}} <b>active</b> <b>station</b> building, Ramsey-Main Street Station, built in 1868, were not listed. Also not {{included}} in the TN were two significant individually-listed historic operating stations, Newark Pennsylvania Station and Hoboken Terminal, both of which are major rail hubs that also serve as terminals for light rail, PATH subway trains, {{and in the case of}} Hoboken, ferries across the Hudson River. Another former intermodal station, the inactive Communipaw Terminal on the Upper New York Bay, had also been previously listed. There are other stations which have also been listed on the state and federal register, such as Mountain Lakes and Demarest which were not part of the TN since they were inactive at the time, were not considered sufficiently significant, or were not part of the NJT system.|$|E

Much against his will, he did not resign his seat in the House, and he held it until the dissolution of 1895.(310) In June (1895) he took a final cruise in one of Sir Donald Currie’s ships, visiting Hamburg, the new North Sea canal, and Copenhagen once more. His injured sight was a far deadlier breach in the habit of his days than withdrawal from office or from parliament. His own tranquil words written in the year in which he laid down his part in the shows of the world’s huge stage, tell the story:— ...|$|E
60|$|As a girl, Ruth Harding {{had been}} one of the mildest and gentlest of the human race. Though new impulses had been given to her {{naturally}} kind affections by the attachments of a wife and mother, her disposition suffered no change by marriage. Obedient, disinterested, and devoted to those she loved, as her parents had known her, so, by the experience of many years, had she proved to Content. In the midst of the utmost equanimity of temper and of deportment, her watchful solicitude in behalf of the few who formed the limited circle of her existence, never slumbered. It dwelt unpretendingly but active in her gentle bosom, like a great and moving principle of life. Though circumstances had placed her on a remote and exposed frontier, where time had not been given for the several customary divisions of employments, she was unchanged in habits, in feelings, and in character. The affluence of her husband had elevated her above the necessity of burthensome toil; and, while she had encountered the dangers of the wilderness, and neglected none of the duties of her <b>active</b> <b>station,</b> she had escaped most of those injurious consequences which are a little apt to impair the peculiar loveliness of woman. Notwithstanding the exposure of a border life, she remained feminine, attractive, and singularly youthful.|$|E
