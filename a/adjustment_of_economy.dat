WR varies among different areas, and years and seasons also in the Northwestern part of China. There are fewer amount of WR per capita, but the efficiency of WR is very low and even extravagant in the areas. The extremely lack of WR causes serious problems in eco-environment and economy development. WR {{is very important in}} the development of Northwestern part of China that is the main area of the Development of Western China. Although water harvesting and water saving are effective measures in the present, they can’t be used as a permanent cure because of the limitation of the WR in the area. The best way of the improvement of the WR in the area should be based on the project of water introducing, especially the project of introducing water from the South to the North in the Western part of China. It is a great cause not only for the present and the country but also for the future and the whole people of China...|$|E

In article basic provisions of transport servicing of economy of the region are determined. On the basis of a research of approaches to determination of transport servicing the author's understanding of this process is provided. The system of transport servicing of the region is considered as set of elements of transport infrastructure through which interaction the needs for cargo transfer and passengers in the region are satisfied. It is the open system having the isolated internal environment and interacting with the external environment. At the same time the internal environment consists of elements between which communication is much stronger, than with the elements constituting the external environment. In market conditions the urgent problem of uncertainty of the external environment influences in turn a condition and development of system of transport servicing of the region, changing external and internal conditions of its functioning. The characteristic of system of transport servicing of the region is provided. Methods of regulation of transport servicing are determined. Features of transport servicing of economy of the region are marked out: need of updating of a property, plant and equipment on transport and development of transport infrastructure; insufficient development of strategic planning of transport as single complex within transport system and in a general context of development of productive forces; the low investment and innovative activity in a motor transportation industry caused by reducing internal and foreign investments, decrease in financing from the government budget. The research of a condition of standard legal support of development of a transport complex in the Voronezh region is conducted, the analysis of the strategic and forecast documents regulating transport servicing in the region is given. The perspective directions of development of a transport complex of the region are determined: steady and effective functioning and development of transport as component of a production infrastructure of Russia is a necessary condition of stabilization and structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> <b>economy.</b> Regional economies create features of a national transport complex, the level of its development and the priority purposes...|$|E

The second is <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>economy</b> itself, to a new pattern of production processes, levels of production and consumption activity; this yields a 'greened economy GDP' (geGDP).

In particular, a temporary increase in unemployment may be observed in a context of stringent anticompetitive product market regulation, or of high replacement rates of unemployment benefits.

30|$|A {{second study}} by Druant et al. (2012) {{examines}} {{the frequency and}} character of wage and price increases and their interrelation. (Recall {{that the degree of}} wage and price rigidity determines the speed <b>of</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>economy</b> to macroeconomic shocks and with it the scale <b>of</b> the <b>adjustment</b> costs.) The authors’ examination of the speed with which firms change prices and wages indicates that the frequency of the latter is roughly one half that of the former—although both “series” display considerable time dependence. The overall stickiness of wages thus exceeds that of prices. The frequency <b>of</b> wage <b>adjustment</b> evinces lower dispersion across sectors, and higher dispersion across countries, than does the frequency <b>of</b> price <b>adjustment.</b> Coupled with widespread wage indexation, the implication of price and wage rigidity is real wage rigidity, which makes the <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>economy</b> to aggregate shocks more costly. The authors’ cet. par. analysis of price and wage rigidity at the firm level indicates that prices are more flexible where competitive pressures in product markets are strong and where labor costs account for a smaller fraction of total costs. Wages are more flexible where bargaining is decentralized (being conducted at the firm level as opposed to the national/sectoral/regional level) and where the coverage of collective bargaining and the stringency of employment protection legislation are low. Finally, descriptive evidence is provided (e.g., on the comparable frequency of wage and price changes and the synchronization between the timing of wage and price changes) showing that wages and prices feed into each other at the firm level and that wage and price rigidity are interrelated especially in labor-intensive sectors.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the optimal intertemporal tradeoff between inflation and output {{in an open}} economy under perfect foresight. The announcement of the optimal plan may, or may not, generate an initial jump in the exchange rate. That depends upon the real adjustment costs, which such unanticipated changes impose on the economy. In the case that such jumps occur, the question of time consistency of the optimal policy arises. A time consistent solution is obtained provided: (i) the policy maker is not too myopic; (ii) the adjustment {{costs associated with the}} jump in the exchange rate are of an appropriate form. The optimal monetary rule is derived and properties of this rule, as well as the overall optimal <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>economy</b> are discussed. ...|$|R

From a neoclassic economic point of view, central initiatives will have suboptimal effects by inhibiting mobility, reducing efficiency and slowing down the <b>adjustment</b> <b>of</b> the <b>economy.</b> On the other hand, deregulations will lead to greater differences between regions (Pike et al. 2006, pp. 6 – 9), and the ‘solution’ for the weaker region’s problems will be migration to more attractive regions (Higgins and Savoie 1997, p. 396).|$|R
