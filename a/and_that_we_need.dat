2500|$|For 1932, Grands Prix had to {{be between}} five and ten hours long. It was the only season in which Nuvolari {{regularly}} drove {{one of the fastest}} cars, the Alfa Romeo P3, and he took two wins and a second place from the three European Championship Grands Prix, plus victory in the championship by four points from Borzacchini. He achieved four other race wins that year, including the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix and a second Targa Florio. Of the latter, his mechanic Mabelli said: [...] "Before the start, Nuvolari told me to go down {{on the floor of the}} car every time he shouts, which was a signal that he went to a curve too fast <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to lower the car´s center of mass. I spent the whole race on the floor. Nuvolari started to shout in the first curve and wouldn't stop until the last one." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the stadium}} {{is owned by}} the City of Toronto, their consent is {{required}} for any modifications. [...] The City insisted that any renovations included making the playing surface longer to fit a CFL field so it could house the Argonauts, who had to vacate their current home Rogers Centre by the end of 2017 season. [...] Mark Grimes, Chairman of Exhibition Place's Board, began negotiating with MLSE on the project and said [...] "I think I have Mr. Leiweke's ear in that I am a big CFL fan <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to get the Argos on stable ground." [...] Deputy Mayor Norm Kelly said that [...] "the Argos have got to play there" [...] and that [...] "I think there is a very good chance that they will." [...] On February 25 Grimes said that a deal was [...] "getting close" [...] and could be reached [...] "in the next couple weeks". [...] Preliminary plans were released to the public on March 5.|$|E
25|$|What {{it really}} {{highlights}} though is that nothing has really changed in our strategy, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to re-equip, <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to grow our capacity, <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to have new products, so I {{think it just}} brings these objectives into focus more and more by having a high profile about what's happened.|$|R
5000|$|I {{told the}} actors that I felt {{something}} was lacking <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> something more explicit, a novelty.

From the beginning at the preparation of the film, there was a spirit of team collaboration, something very positive that made our work fun. I don’t know why, but we all knew we were making a film {{that was going to be}} important.|$|R

60|$|But one remedy {{presented}} itself to his mind; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> not say was to purchase new ones. Inquiring {{the way to}} the most genteel ready-made-clothes' establishment in the city of Cologne, and finding it was kept in the Minoriten Strasse, by an ancestor of the celebrated Moses of London, the noble Childe hied him towards the emporium; but you may be sure did not neglect to perform his religious duties by the way. Entering the cathedral, he made straight for the shrine of Saint Buffo, and hiding himself behind a pillar there (fearing he might be recognized by the archbishop, or any of his father's numerous friends in Cologne), he proceeded with his devotions, as was the practice of the young nobles of the age.|$|E
60|$|Society is {{commonly}} too cheap. We meet at very short intervals, not having {{had time to}} acquire any new value for each other. We meet at meals three times a day, and give each other a new taste of that old musty cheese that we are. We have had {{to agree on a}} certain set of rules, called etiquette and politeness, to make this frequent meeting tolerable <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> not come to open war. We meet at the post-office, and at the sociable, and about the fireside every night; we live thick and are in each other's way, and stumble over one another, and I think that we thus lose some respect for one another. Certainly less frequency would suffice for all important and hearty communications. Consider the girls in a factory--never alone, hardly in their dreams. It would be better if there were but one inhabitant to a square mile, as where I live. The value of a man is not in his skin, that we should touch him.|$|E

It {{is a great}} mercy to be convinced that we are sinners, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> a Saviour; count it therefore a mercy, and that thy convictions may end in conversion, do thou take heed of stifling of them. It {{is the way of}} poor sinners to look upon convictions as things that are hurtful; and therefore they use to shun the awakening ministry, and to check a convincing conscience. Such poor sinners are much like to the wanton boy that stands at the maid's elbow, to blow out her candle as fast as she lights it at the fire. Convinced sinner, God lighteth thy candle, and thou puttest it out; God lights it again, and thou puttest it out. Yea, [...] "how oft is the candle of the wicked put out?" [...] (Job 21:17) At last, God resolveth he will light thy candle no more; and then, like the Egyptians, you dwell all your days in darkness, and never see light more, but by the light of hell-fire; wherefore give glory to God, and if he awakens thy conscience, quench not thy convictions. Do it, saith the prophet, [...] "before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and he turn" [...] your convictions [...] "into the shadow of death, and make them gross darkness." [...] (Jer 13:16) ...|$|E
60|$|It {{may not be}} {{superfluous}} {{to notice}} a few more of the common misapprehensions of utilitarian ethics, even those which are so obvious and gross that it might appear impossible for any person of candour and intelligence to fall into them: since persons, even of considerable mental endowments, often give themselves so little trouble to understand the bearings of any opinion against which they entertain a prejudice, and men are in general so little conscious of this voluntary ignorance as a defect, that the vulgarest misunderstandings of ethical doctrines are continually met with in the deliberate writings of persons of the greatest pretensions both to high principle and to philosophy. We not uncommonly hear the doctrine of utility inveighed against as a godless doctrine. If it be necessary to {{say anything at all}} against so mere an assumption, we may say that the question depends upon what idea we have formed of the moral character of the Deity. If it be a true belief that God desires, above all things, the happiness of his creatures, and that this was his purpose in their creation, utility is not only not a godless doctrine, but more profoundly religious than any other. If it be meant that utilitarianism does not recognise the revealed will of God as the supreme law of morals, I answer, that an utilitarian who believes in the perfect goodness and wisdom of God, necessarily believes that whatever God has thought fit to reveal on the subject of morals, must fulfil the requirements of utility in a supreme degree. But others besides utilitarians have been of opinion that the Christian revelation was intended, and is fitted, to inform {{the hearts and minds of}} mankind with a spirit which should enable them to find for themselves what is right, and incline them to do it when found, rather than to tell them, except in a very general way, what it is: <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> a doctrine of ethics, carefully followed out, to interpret to us the will of God. Whether this opinion is correct or not, it is superfluous here to discuss; since whatever aid religion, either natural or revealed, can afford to ethical investigation, is as open to the utilitarian moralist as to any other. He can use it as the testimony of God to the usefulness or hurtfulness of any given course of action, by as good a right as others can use it for the indication of a transcendental law, having no connexion with usefulness or with happiness.|$|E
