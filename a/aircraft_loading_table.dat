40|$|Low cycle {{fatigue life}} and crack growth rates were {{analysis}} established for random load sequences, generated from three combat <b>aircraft</b> <b>load</b> exceedance curves using different algorithms, including simulated rain-flow cycle count,extreme-to-extreme excursions, upper to lower bound excursions and unrestricted peak-trough excursions. Also, {{the response of}} a fatigue meter to a random load sequence was simulated. Fatigue damage for the different load histories was computed using material constants for an Al-Cu alloy. Computed fatigue damage was relatively insensitive to the algorithm used for load sequence generation from combat <b>aircraft</b> <b>load</b> exceedance curves. Fatigue meter data based damage estimates were, however,sometimes unconservative...|$|R

The example discussed in this paper, which is associated with crack growth under a representative maritime <b>aircraft</b> <b>load</b> spectrum, when taken in conjunction with previous studies into cracks growing under combat <b>aircraft</b> <b>load</b> spectra illustrates how for cracks that grow from naturally occurring material discontinuities under such operational load spectra there is generally little crack closure so that the crack growth history from its initial equivalent pre-crack size (EPS) through to final failure can be easily and accurately computed...|$|R
