5|$|The castle design {{formed an}} inner and <b>an</b> <b>outer</b> ward, {{surrounded}} in turn by a moat, now partially filled.

The dock was protected by a wall later named the Gunners Walk and a firing platform that may have housed a trebuchet siege engine during the medieval period.

5|$|The castle was {{subsequently}} given by Henry II to Thomas Becket {{when he became}} chancellor in 1155. Becket extended the castle to accommodate his large household, but fell from favour in 1164 and the castle was confiscated by the king. Henry II liked Berkhamsted and subsequently used it himself extensively. By the mid-12th century, the castle had been rebuilt in stone, probably by Becket, with a shell keep and <b>an</b> <b>outer</b> stone wall; the bailey was divided in two by a wall to form an inner and <b>an</b> <b>outer</b> bailey. A gatehouse led down into the town, meeting with Castle Street. Henry II also officially recognised the surrounding settlement of Berkhamsted as a town in 1156.|$|E

40|$|Almtract [...] The ffects of {{the inner}} and outer {{barriers}} on the performance of mid-wavelength (3 - 5 #m) GaAs/AlGaAs double barrier quantum well infra-red photodetectors (DBQWIPs) have been studied. It was found that the peak response wavelength had a significant red shift when the thickness of the AlAs inner barriers was below 10 A. This is attributed to the lowering of the upper state energy in the quantum wells. The responsivity ofDBQWIPs decreases with the inner barrier thickness. This is because the optical gain decreases faster than the increasing rate of the quantum efficiency when the inner barrier thickness increases. The responsivities fordevices with different Al compositions (0. 35 and 0. 24) in the outer barriers are in the same range, but the dark currents for devices with A 10. 35 Ga 0. 65 <b>As</b> <b>outer</b> barriers are much lower than those with Alo. ~Gao. 76 <b>As</b> <b>outer</b> barriers.
