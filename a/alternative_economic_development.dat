40|$|Global {{growth of}} nuclear energy in the 21 st century is {{creating}} new challenges to limit {{the spread of nuclear}} technology without hindering adoption in countries now considering nuclear power. Independent nuclear states desire autonomy over energy choices and seek energy independence. However, this independence comes with high costs for development of new indigenous fuel cycle capabilities. Nuclear supplier states and expert groups have proposed fuel supply assurance mechanisms such as fuel take-back services, international enrichment services and fuel banks in exchange for recipient state concessions on the development of sensitive technologies. Nuclear states are slow to accept any concessions to their rights under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. To date, decisions not to develop indigenous fuel cycle capabilities have been driven primarily by economics. However, additional incentives may be required to offset a nuclear state’s perceived loss of energy independence. This paper proposes <b>alternative</b> <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> incentives that could help countries decide to forgo development of sensitive nuclear technologies. The incentives are created through a nuclear-centered industrial complex with “symbiotic” links to indigenous economic opportunities.

Economic development practitioners have recently started to prioritise the retention and growing of existing investments to enhance their economic development agenda. There are few studies that provide any guidance to investment aftercare practitioners faced with this <b>alternative</b> <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> option. The main {{aim of this study}} is to obtain a better understanding of and to investigate the relationship between investment aftercare and inward FDI in South Africa. Investment aftercare is defined as post-investment services that an investment promotion agency (IPA) can offer to existing investors (Loewendahl 2001 : 25). Six research questions were investigated in this study, namely, how do IPAs allocate financial and human resources to investment aftercare function in relation to other investment promotion functions? Do IPAs in South Africa have dedicated and comprehensive investment aftercare strategies and how often are they reviewing these strategies? What factors limit IPAs’ ability to provide effective investment aftercare services? What investment aftercare models are used by IPAs within South Africa? Are IPAs evaluating the impact of their investment aftercare programmes? Which government level is most appropriate to offer investment aftercare services? Both quantitative and qualitative research methodologies are used in this study to address these six research questions and theoretical frameworks are selected to define the scope of the research. A structured questionnaire was used to collate data and 30 face-to-face interviews were conducted with 16 investment aftercare practitioners and 14 investment aftercare executives from IPAs in seven of the nine provinces of South Africa...|$|E

Potential benefits include the employment of community members in land-based activities that enhance cultural identity, contribute to social well-being, support inter-generational knowledge transmission, and promote cross-cultural exchange. The extent to which wildlife tourism delivers on its promise is not well documented and tends to privilege the perspective of external experts over those of community members. Furthermore, a fuller appreciation of community expectations, concerns, and (mis) understandings is often lacking {{at the outset of}} a project with implications for its long-term success and acceptance. This thesis examines a polar bear viewing project proposed for the James Bay Cree community of Wemindji. It responds to an invitation from the Wemindji leadership to contribute information on the proposal by addressing two different aspects of the project. Firstly, it avails of geospatial technology to provide a preliminary population survey of the polar bears that can inform an assessment of the economic viability and likely wildlife impact of the project. Secondly, it uses semi-structured interviews with community members to document local perspectives on the project, including local assessments of potential benefits but also local concerns. The results of the population survey show that while geospatial technologies can provide a useful snapshot of polar bear population numbers and location, there are limitations to the accuracy and viability of these methods. The results of the community consultation affirm the value of local insights and the need to take full account of local perspectives before proceeding with a final decision on whether this project should proceed...|$|E

Residents on the Lower North Shore of Quebec are responding to the fisheries crisis by identifying <b>alternative</b> <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> strategies, including a small scale ecotourism industry centred around some of the oldest seabird sanctuaries in North America. Policy makers and communities hope that this type of tourism will generate revenue and employment while also protecting the natural areas upon which local residents depend. Unfortunately, little is known at this time about the ability of ecotourism to live up to this promise. In this context, the central goal of this thesis is to examine the feasibility ecotourism to act as a mechanism for sustainable economic development In order to meet this objective, this research draws upon and refines past attempts by geographers to grapple with the links between the tourism industry and destination development. The thesis shows that the dominant theoretical frameworks of the 1980 s cannot provide us with an adequate understanding of the rapidly evolving tourism industry and its role in regional development processes and protected area management. Instead, this thesis adopts post-Fordist theories of tourism development to conduct a microscale analysis on the impacts and underlying structure of the ecotourism industry and its linkages to protected areas and local communities in the region. By synthesizing quantitative and qualitative evidence in the realist tradition, a systematic methodology is generated to argue that a bottom-up, multi-scale network approach provides the greatest potential for promoting more sustainable forms of tourism development...|$|E
40|$|Federal Indian {{policies}} which {{have contributed to}} the extensive architecture of tribal land regulations have rendered Native American reservations unfit to fully realize economic development potential. With extremely limited investment capital, Tribes can only afford investments in industries with very high marginal returns. Indian Gaming is one such industry in which some tribes have a competitive advantage. The emergence of Indian Gaming and the subsequent federal (and existing) policies have resulted in dire political and social externalities for Native American people. Political consequences related to gaming policies such as the Indian Gaming Reorganization Act (IGRA), have resulted in the compromise of sovereignty. In general, tribes who are allowed to and chose to game have become subjected to state, county and municipal jurisdiction, contrary to age old Federal Indian Policy which established Tribes' sovereign rights. Local Economic Alternative Development Strategies (LEADS) serve as an alternative model for development on reservations. LEADS can shape economic development trajectories that are sensitive to the tenets of sovereignty and self determination. This thesis examines the utility of LEADS in guiding tribal economic development for Native American reservations. Specifically, this thesis is a case study of the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California, a Native American Tribe located around the center of Lake Tahoe and positioned at the borders of two adjoining states. To examine the potential of the LEADS model on the Washoe reservation, I conducted surveys and community interviews and utilized a combination of secondary data.

The forcommunicated paper deals {{the impact of the}} Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), or Superfund, on local communities and their sense of place in southwest Colorado. A literature review of relevant research was conducted, revealing the economic impacts of Superfund (mean 4 - 16. 26 % depreciation in property values) via hedonic regression analysis. Studies of the impact of outside stigma also demonstrated the endemic capacity of negative, outside outlooks to exacerbate the challenges of post-industrial development. Case studies were also gathered from other sources, covering the sequence of events in Toluca, Illinois; Cokedale, Colorado; Picher, Oklahoma; and Berlin, North Carolina. Common trends were observed in the recounting of said case stories that impacted the evolution of their geographic identity in dealing with site designation and remediation proceedings. Trends included the homogeneity of sense of place, community involvement in remediation efforts, existing <b>alternative</b> <b>economic</b> <b>development,</b> motivation {{on the part of the}} government itself, and a community’s ability to cope with and combat outside stigma. These trends were then used to generate a case study of superfund proceedings in Durango, Colorado, and the remediation of the “Smelter” site, the location of the leftover tailings of the Vanadium Corporation of America.

In the cases of both Durango, and Silverton, there was observed to be high levels of community involvement and alternative exploration, namely into tourism, which suggests a positive ultimate outcome in each case.

Such policies were initiated under the 1982 Kentucky Revised Statute 154. 45 (KRS 154. 45), which introduced enterprise zones to the Commonwealth and its urban areas. The policy goals of KRS 154. 45 that are examined include: 1) {{the improvement of the}} quality of life of individuals that reside within the Louisville and Jefferson County Enterprise Zone (EZ); 2) the encouragement of economic activity through business formation, job creation, and job retention within the EZ; and 3) the elimination of blighted and deteriorated areas within the EZ. Several primary and general methods of analysis are utilized: direct comparisons of descriptive statistics, surveys, shift-share analysis, cost-benefit analysis and quasi-experimentation. The politics and history surrounding Louisville and Jefferson County 2 ̆ 7 s Enterprise Zone will also be discussed and examined. Political considerations appear to have played a key role in the evolution of the EZ program. The study shows that the EZ program cannot be considered a total success based upon the goals and objectives of KRS 154. 45. It is estimated that nearly 218 million in foregone tax revenues and fees were used to create jobs and investment that would probably have been generated regardless of incentives. In fact, job and investment growth in the EZ did not come close to the growth experienced in other parts of Jefferson County that did not have EZ incentives as well as to that experienced by Jefferson County as a whole during the same time period. This is true even when controlling for government incentives that may have existed in other parts of Jefferson County. This study addresses the issues of local economic development policies and planning. A lack of planning and focus is identified as one reason why the EZ did not meet expectations. Other reasons why the EZ did not fully succeed will be discussed as well as possible <b>alternative</b> <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> programs that could have benefited the area targeted by the EZ program...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{importance}} of developing alternative livelihoods in Indonesia is reaching a critical level. Over 60 % {{of the population}} is reliant upon the ocean for employment and destructive fishing practices have destroyed over half of the marine habitat. As a result, family incomes have suffered and fishers have been forced to travel farther from home, often leaving their families for a month at a time. In response, development efforts have begun to focus their attention on small entrepreneurial businesses that offer an increase in the average wage earned by rural fisherman while also reducing the pressure on wild fish stocks. The business model under analysis employs a franchise system of business development whereby fishermen buy kits to build backyard mariculture tanks capable of raising marine species for export and also for local consumption. While developers have observed success with local adoption and with species rearing, one major challenge remains. The mariculture systems require a constant energy supply to run the pumps but 47 % of the country does not have access to electricity. This hurdle poses a significant challenge for the success of the mariculture program but also for other economic development initiatives that often rely on electricity access. The purpose of this Masters Project was to investigate energy alternatives for rural regions of Indonesia, calculate the costs and feasibility of energy development and evaluate the efficacy of the mariculture business model after inclusion of full energy costs. This was accomplished over a five month period through extensive data collection in the field. NGOs, private firms and government agencies were interviewed and documents were obtained. Results of the data collection were analyzed using the Homer Energy Modeling System and other Excel based tools. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the costs of energy development in Indonesia are prohibitive for mariculture entrepreneurs. A series of hurdles including geographic isolation, government mandated price ceilings for rate payers and limited wind resource availability pose significant barriers. The results suggest that <b>alternative</b> <b>economic</b> <b>development</b> on island regions of Indonesia should focus on industries that do not require a constant and steady energy supply. Businesses that can take advantage of a short duration of electricity supply or one that is unpredictable will be more cost effective and appropriate to local income levels...|$|E
