25|$|In the United States, Canada, Mexico and Brazil, {{collaboration}} between anthropology and medicine was initially concerned with implementing community health programs among {{ethnic and cultural}} minorities and with the qualitative and ethnographic evaluation of health institutions (hospitals and mental hospitals) and primary care services. Regarding the community health programs, the intention was to resolve the problems of establishing these services for a complex mosaic of ethnic groups. The ethnographic evaluation involved analyzing the interclass conflicts within the institutions which had an undesirable effect on their administrative reorganization and their institutional objectives, particularly those conflicts among the doctors, nurses, <b>auxiliary</b> <b>staff</b> and administrative staff. The ethnographic reports show that interclass crises directly affected therapeutic criteria and care of the ill. They also contributed new methodological criteria for evaluating the new institutions resulting from the reforms as well as experimental care techniques such as therapeutic communities.|$|E

40|$|This bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} {{comparison}} of auxiliary nursing professions in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. After the split of Czechoslovakia in 1993, {{there were a}} number of changes in health legislation. This work provides a comprehensive view of the development and current situation of health care assistants, auxiliary nurses, nurses and health care workers. The objectives of this work were to compare the development of individual professions, the concept of education, the possibilities of lifelong learning and professional association. The aim of the work was also to describe the actual performances, performed by <b>auxiliary</b> nursing <b>staff</b> and the legal requirements for the competencies of these professions. Through the form of a questionnaire survey, a survey was carried out between the <b>auxiliary</b> nursing <b>staff</b> in both countries, which showed that there was a significant overrun of competencies in both Slovak and Czech respondents. The provision of high-quality nursing care is currently highlighted. An important factor in providing quality and safe care is the proper division of tasks between nursing team members and the pursuit of a profession in accordance with legally defined competencies. keywords: Regulation of profession, health-care profession, nursing, health-care assistent, auxiliary [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} which of the Eighteen Basic Middle School Principles were influenced by the Indiana Comprehensive Assessment and Program Planning System (CAPPS) based on perceptions of middle school principals. A second purpose was to determine the extent of influence (positive, negative, no influence) exerted by CAPPS on the Eighteen Basic Middle School Principles. A survey instrument consisting of eighteen items in five Likert-response categories was mailed to: one-hundred randomly selected middle school principals in Indiana. Space was provided for respondents to write a statement describing how CAPPS influenced each middle school principle. Sixty-two middle school principals responded to the survey. Middle school principles most influenced by CAPPS were basic skill repair and extension, and planned gradualism. Principles least influenced were continuous progress programs, intramural activities, social experiences, independent study and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>staffing.</b> Sixty-five percent of responding principals indicated CAPPS exerted no influence on the combined eighteen principles. Conclusions derived from data revealed although CAPPS was not perceived as exerting a major influence, it was seen as positive. CAPPS has influenced textbook, material selection and increased articulation between grade levels. Emphasis on basic skill areas and remediation have increased due to CAPPS. Rationale for the middle school was to meet developmental opmental needs of transescent youth. However, the middle school concept has been implemented for a variety of reasons including dissatisfaction with the junior high school and reorganization of grade, levels to facilitate. desegregation and changing enrollments. Recommendations for further research include assess merit of educators to determine understanding of CAPPS and the middle school concept. Research also needs to be conducted to determine if educators are following CAPPS guidelines. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R

The quality of the services offered by the hospital can be appreciated from the consumer’s point of view, by means of the following elements: staff, physical support of carrying out, hospital environment, and process of creation and delivery of service, the result of the treatment...|$|R
