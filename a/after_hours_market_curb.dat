40|$|This paper {{uses the}} natural {{experiment}} {{offered by the}} Shanghai Stock Exchange to investigate the impact of opening call auction transparency on market liquidity. We find that the dissemination of indicative trade information during the pre-open call auction session leads to an overall improvement in stock liquidity in the continuous trading session. Bid-ask spreads narrow in the first trading hour because adverse selection risk fell significantly and there is less price volatility in the continuous market. This effect is greater for actively traded securities than illiquid securities. Our findings are robust for different lengths of sample period, different lengths of trading <b>hours</b> <b>after</b> <b>market</b> open, and stocks that had (and had not) reformed the share split structure during our research period. 33 page(s...|$|R

Farmers, boat people and traders came from {{as far as the}} nearby coastal districts of Guangdong Province. Shop houses, inns, residential houses and temples with street sellers clustered along the streets made it a commercial as well as a cultural centre. Temples were built for worship and to judge disputes. Special market days, xuri (墟日), were scheduled on the 3rd, 6th and 9th days of the three ten-day periods of each lunar month. The market operated from 6 in the morning until dusk. Two entrance gates, one in the east, Tung Mun (東門), and one in the south, Nam Mun (南門), were locked up <b>after</b> the <b>market</b> <b>hours</b> to guard against theft and robbery. At its peak in the early 20th century, the Hui had around one hundred shops. The market wasmanaged by the Kwong Yu Tong (光裕堂), a trust of a branch of the Tangs inKam Tin.|$|R

He also gave testimony on their restrictions concerning new business, and how swindlers were dealt with. On November 10, 1909, Mendels issued a notice reading that [...] "For {{the protection of the}} public, complaints made in writing against any corporation or individual using the New York <b>Curb</b> <b>market,</b> directly or indirectly, will be investigated by the agency and referred to the proper authorities for suitable action."

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of trading <b>after</b> <b>hours</b> on the amount and timing of price {{discovery}} over the 24 -hour day. A high volume of liquidity trade facilitates price discovery. Thus prices are more efficient and more information is revealed per hour during the trading day than <b>after</b> <b>hours.</b> However, the low trading volume <b>after</b> <b>hours</b> generates significant, albeit inefficient, price discovery. Individual trades contain more information <b>after</b> <b>hours</b> than during the day. Because information asymmetry declines over the day, price changes are larger, reflect more private information, and are less noisy before the open than after the close.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To analyse {{patterns}} of patient utilisation of the <b>after</b> <b>hours</b> service at Sydney Sexual Health Centre (SSHC). METHOD: A retrospective cross sectional database study compared all new daytime and <b>after</b> <b>hours</b> patients who registered {{for a medical}} consultation at SSHC between August 1994 and February 1995. Daytime and <b>after</b> <b>hours</b> attenders were compared using demographic and behavioural factors and for prevalence of STDs and HIV using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Of the 1662 eligible patients, 1362 (81. 9 %) attended during daytime hours, and 300 (18. 1 %) attended <b>after</b> <b>hours.</b> There {{was no significant difference}} in <b>after</b> <b>hours</b> attendance between patients living in inner compared with outer metropolitan zones. Using logistic regression analysis, being female (p = 0. 0008), being between 20 and 39 years of age (p = 0. 008), being employed (p < 0. 001), and having no previous STD/genitourinary condition (p = 0. 034) were the factors significantly associated with <b>after</b> <b>hours</b> attendance. CONCLUSIONS: The evening service was disproportionately utilised by a patient group not defined as "high risk" in the objectives of the service. This study challenges the assumption that evening clinics are always the way to reach high risk groups. ...|$|R

In 1911, the {{curbstone}} brokers came to {{be known}} as the New York <b>Curb</b> <b>Market,</b> which then had a formal constitution with brokerage and listing standards. After several years of outdoor trading, the curbstone brokers moved indoors in 1921 to a building on Greenwich Street in Lower Manhattan. In 1929, the New York <b>Curb</b> <b>Market</b> changed its name to the New York Curb Exchange. Within no time, the Curb Exchange became the leading international stock market, listing more foreign issues than all other U.S. securities markets combined. In 1953, the Curb Exchange was renamed the American Stock Exchange. The building currently has a building area of 181,725 sq. ft.|$|R
40|$|Agency {{problems}} limit firms' {{access to}} capital <b>markets,</b> <b>curbing</b> investment. Firms and investors seek contractual ways to mitigate these problems. What are the implications for investment? We present a theory of a firm's investment dynamics {{in the presence of}} agency problems and optimal long-term financial contracts. We derive results relating firms' investment decisions, current and past cash flows, firm size, capital structure, and dividends. Among the results, optimal investment is increasing in current and past cash flow; and optimal investment is positively serially correlated over time (after controlling for investment opportunities). These results hold for a range of agency problems. (JEL G 30, G 31, G 32, G 35, D 82, D 86, D 92) Copyright 2007, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
