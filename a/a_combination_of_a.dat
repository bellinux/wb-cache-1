5|$|A complex {{predicate}} is {{the combination}} {{of more than one}} element, more than one individual word, to convey the information involved in a single event. For instance, the event swim is conveyed in Wagiman using <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> verb ya- 'go' and a coverb liri-ma 'swimming'. There is no verb in Wagiman that, on its own, conveys the event of swimming.|$|E
5|$|Fauna is sparse on {{the island}} due to <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lack of {{vegetation}} {{and the consequences of}} phosphates mining. Many indigenous birds have disappeared or become rare owing to destruction of their habitat. There are about 60recorded vascular plant species native to the island, none of which are endemic. Coconut farming, mining, and introduced species have caused serious disturbance to the native vegetation.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the finding}} of <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> low {{pituitary}} hormone together with a low hormone from the effector gland is indicative of hypopituitarism. Occasionally, the pituitary hormone may be normal but the effector gland hormone decreased; in this case, the pituitary is not responding appropriately to effector hormone changes, and the combination of findings is still suggestive of hypopituitarism.|$|E

5|$|The Nuttalliellidae can be {{distinguished}} from both ixodid and argasid ticks by <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> projecting capitulum at the front and a soft, leathery skin. Other distinguish characteristics include {{the position of the}} stigmata, the lack of setae, the strongly corrugated integument, and the form of the fenestrated plates.|$|E
5|$|The {{legend of}} Sharabha as an {{incarnation}} of Shiva is narrated in many Hindu scriptures and each presents a different version to suit one’s religious beliefs. But one common refrain {{in all these}} depictions is that Sharabha is <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> huge animal-bird beast with enormous strength manifested {{with the purpose of}} pacifying similar ferocious avatars of Vishnu such as Narasimha (man-lion) or Varaha (the boar).|$|E

5|$|The {{second round}} {{began with the}} two fighters exchanging a flurry of strikes. Silva then {{attempted}} a takedown with <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> body lock and a trip, but Jackson reversed it into a takedown of his own. The action stayed in Silva's guard very briefly, until the two scrambled back to their feet.|$|E
5|$|Admission is {{determined}} by <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> student's score on the Independent School Entrance Examination and recent grades, and is limited to residents {{of the city of}} Boston. Although Boston Latin runs from the 7th through the 12th grade, it admits students only into the 7th and 9th grades. In 2007, the school was named one of the top twenty high schools in the United States by U.S. News & World Report.|$|E
5|$|At 10:52am on 26 March 1907, {{an express}} {{passenger}} train travelling from Heworth signal box derailed on {{the approach to}} Felling station. The cause was <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sharp frost {{in the morning and}} unseasonal heat later in the day which saw the track expand and kink. The derailment, which saw all bar two carriages rolled over entirely, cost two passengers their lives, with eight more seriously hurt and a further 34 suffering minor injuries such as shock.|$|E

5|$|During 1888, Jingyuen was repainted {{along with}} the rest of the Chinese Navy, {{changing}} from the all grey scheme she had sailed from England with, to <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> black hull, white above the waterline and buff coloured funnels, typical of the Victorian era. In May 1889, Jingyuen and the Beiyang Fleet were moved to fortify Weihaiwei (now Weihai). During the summer of that year, she was part of the flotilla led by Admiral Ding Ruchang, which travelled to Chefoo (now Yantai), Chemlupo (now Incheon, South Korea), and the Imperial Russian Navy base of Vladivostok. On the return leg of the journey, they stopped at Fusan (now Busan, South Korea).|$|E

5|$|In ice hockey, <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> player's {{goals and}} assists are collectively called points. Penalty minutes are {{the total number}} of minutes {{assigned}} to a player for infractions assessed during the season. Plus-minus is a statistic that tracks when a player was on the ice while goals were scored, both for and against their team, though some in game situations will not effect the statistic. Below is a listing of all player statistics for the Blue Jackets during the season.|$|E
5|$|Superman is {{well known}} for its {{large-scale}} visual effects sequences, all of which were created before the digital age. The Golden Gate Bridge scale model stood 70 feet long and 20 feet wide. Other miniatures included the Krypton Council Dome and the Hoover Dam. Slow motion was used to simulate the vast amount of water for the Hoover Dam destruction. The Fortress of Solitude was <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> full-scale set and matte paintings. Young Clark Kent's long-distance football punt was executed with a wooden football loaded into an air blaster placed in the ground. The Superman costume was to be a much darker blue, but the use of blue screen made it transparent.|$|E
5|$|The {{avalanche}} {{scenes were}} due to be filmed in co-operation with the Swiss army who annually used explosions to prevent snow build-up by causing avalanches, but the area chosen naturally avalanched just before filming. The final result was <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man-made avalanche at an isolated Swiss location shot by the second unit, stock footage, and images created by the special effects crew with salt. The stuntmen were filmed later, added by optical effects. For the scene where Bond and Tracy crash into a car race while being pursued, an ice rink was constructed over an unused aeroplane track, with water and snow sprayed on it constantly. Lazenby and Rigg {{did most of the}} driving due to the high number of close-ups.|$|E
50|$|For {{many workers}} in the field a reactor is an item which is too expensive, instead {{it is common to}} use a neutron source which uses <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> alpha emitter and beryllium. These sources tend to be much weaker than reactors.|$|R

5|$|The company {{worked on}} tight profit margins {{immediately}} post-war. <b>A</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shortage of skilled labour, outdated batch production methods and increasing costs in materials and payroll were matched by rising overhead, {{a shortage of}} materials and issues of absenteeism. The result was that despite a booming order book Redman was struggling to fulfil its commitments to customers, and gross margins on lathes were as low as 2.16%. The company {{was by no means}} unique in facing these difficulties but there was much urging, agonising and recriminating, by Gabriel and A K McKay, the Redman managing director since at least 1936, regarding {{how to deal with the}} issues. Some of this, perhaps inevitably as the war-time command economy reverted, was aimed at the government.|$|E
5|$|The merle Pomeranian is {{a recent}} color {{developed}} by breeders. It is <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> solid base color with lighter blue/grey patch which gives a mottled effect. The most common base colors for the effect are red/brown or black, although it can also appear with other colors. Combinations such as brindle merle or liver merle are not accepted in the breed standard. In addition, the eye, nose and paw pad are marshmallow color, changing parts of the eye to blue and the color on the nose and paw pads to become mottled pink and black.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{resonators}} in the expression {{corresponds to the}} number of passbands required. Lowpass and highpass filters can be viewed as special cases of the resonator expression with {{one or the other of}} the terms becoming zero as appropriate. Bandstop filters can be regarded as <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lowpass and a highpass filter. Multiple bandstop filters can always be expressed in terms of a multiple bandpass filter. In this way it, can be seen that this transformation represents the general case for any bandform, and all the other transformations are to be viewed as special cases of it.|$|E
50|$|Hybrid {{electric}} buses use <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> electric battery pack and a diesel engine to provide power, and produce around 40% less carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions than traditional diesel engined buses.
