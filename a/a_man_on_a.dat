5|$|In another story, Stowe and Calvin meet <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Mandarin dock who {{has been}} cheated out of much the land he was given by the government. Named Old Cudjo, he worked the small {{homestead}} on which he grew cotton for years. Where at first the neighbors surrounding the colony of former slaves from South Carolina were hesitant and suspicious, Old Cudjo and his colony were so industrious and honest that they won their white neighbors over. One who was a {{justice of the peace}} intervened on his behalf and Old Cudjo's land was returned to him. Stowe's final chapter is dedicated to defending the notion that blacks should be employed to help build the state of Florida to transform it from a wilderness into a civilization. They are better suited for work in the hot sun, more resistant to malaria, and are trustworthy and extremely eager to learn. She also dedicates a few pages to her interested observations on their culture as she details overhearing their festivities at night and sitting outside an informal church service.|$|E
5|$|Their fourth child, Claire, is {{delivered}} by {{a neighbor of}} the family in the lounge of their house as a hurricane is heading towards the Eastern Seaboard. The book follows the family through the 1960s and 1970s, as the children enter adolescence and discover themselves during the changing times of the 1960s and the Sexual Revolution. The Keane children, on entering early adulthood, begin to break away from their family and religious backgrounds. Jacob, the eldest child, serves in Vietnam and is killed in the French trenches. Michael moves away from Long Island and goes to study in a college in northern New York, but later turns to sex and drugs. Meanwhile, Annie, the bookworm of the family, leaves to study in England, but quickly changes her plans after meeting <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bus whom she likes. Claire, the youngest, returns from a summer vacation to her former Catholic high school, showing a changed personality and increased self-confidence.|$|E

25|$|The hanging of Reginald Birchall in Woodstock, Ont. in November 1890 {{seems to}} be the last time a device of this kind was used. Radclive had first been exposed to executions as a Royal Navy seaman helping with {{shipboard}} hangings of pirates in the South China Sea, and it is possible he was trying to approximate something similar to hanging <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> ship's yardarm. After Birchall's hanging, Radclive used the traditional long drop method, as did his successors.|$|E
25|$|Ancient rock paintings, which {{date back}} 5000 years, {{have been found}} in the {{northern}} part of Somalia; these depict early life in the territory. The most famous of these is the Laas Geel complex, which contains some of the earliest known rock art on the African continent and features many elaborate pastoralist sketches of animal and human figures. In other places, such as the northern Dhambalin region, a depiction of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> horse is postulated as being one of the earliest known examples of a mounted huntsman.|$|E
25|$|The Cerro de la Bufa is {{very close}} to the city of Guanajuato and has a number of stories {{associated}} with it. At sunset, there is a formation that looks like the profile of the face of a bearded man. According to tradition, this is the face of Christ. There are two caves consecrated to Ignatius of Loyola. There are {{on opposite sides of the}} summit and called the “old” and “new” cave. Each 31 of July, there is a pilgrimage to the “new” cave in honor of the saint. Sometime during the colonial period, an image of Ignatius was painted on a wall. According to legend, a group of male witches used to use the cave for their rites on the eve before the Catholic ritual, “forcing” the image on the wall to observe. The Cerro de la Bufa is home to another legend about an enchanted princess. It states that on feast days, a woman would appear to <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> road in the mountain and ask him to carry her to the Basilica in the city center in his arms. If he did so, the city of Guanajuato would return to the height of its wealth. If he chose to do so, noises and threats from behind would haunt him. If he lost his resolve, the woman would turn into a serpent and kill him. No woman has ever been carried from this mountain to the Basilica.|$|E

500|$|According {{to popular}} {{historian}} Arthur Herman, Murrow's staff edited {{the film to}} show McCarthy behaving in an unflattering [...] way. Herman quotes John Cogley of Commonweal, a McCarthy critic, as stating, [...] "A totally different selection of film would turn McCarthy into <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> shining white steed—infinitely reasonable, burdened with the onus of single-handedly cleaning out subversives {{in the face of}} violent criticism."

500|$|Hordern {{was cast}} in John Mortimer's 1957 play The Dock Brief in which Hordern played the {{barrister}}. [...] The story centres on a failed lawyer who is hired {{at the last minute}} to defend <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> charge of murder. Hordern played the barrister opposite David Kossoff's murder suspect. After some positive comments from the theatrical press, the play transferred to television in May the same year and earned Hordern a Best Actor Award at the 1958 British Academy Television Awards. The Horderns moved to Donnington, Berkshire in 1958 where they renovated three cottages into one; the property became the family home and is where Hordern and Eve remained until their deaths.|$|E

500|$|Upon publication, [...] "Langit Makin Mendung" [...] drew heavy {{criticism}} for its depictions of Allah, Muhammad, and Gabriel. Sastra was banned in North Sumatra, and the magazine's offices in Jakarta were attacked. Despite published apologies from {{the writer and}} publisher, the head editor of Sastra, HB Jassin, was tried for blasphemy; he was later sentenced to a one-year suspended sentence. Critical views of the story vary; the story {{has been compared to}} Dante's Divine Comedy for its depiction of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> spiritual quest with a spiritual companion, yet criticized for depicting Allah, Muhammad, and Gabriel in a negative light. The legal case itself has been subject to debate, with both sides arguing freedom of expression and the scope of imagination.|$|E
500|$|After signing for Sheffield United, Evans {{moved to}} Millhouse Green, Penistone, {{in the nearby}} Barnsley area. After the death of former Wales boss and Sheffield United player, coach and manager Gary Speed, Evans {{revealed}} a message under his shirt after scoring his first goal in the FA Cup win over Torquay United, which read: [...] "Rest in peace Speedo." [...] Evans stated regarding the death of Gary Speed that [...] "I was <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> mission. I had a message on my top for Gary Speed which I wanted to show.

500|$|While telling Bart and Lisa about 1990, Homer says, [...] "Tracey Ullman was {{entertaining}} America with [...] crudely drawn filler material." [...] This is {{a reference}} to The Simpsonss debut as [...] "bumpers" [...] airing before and after commercials on The Tracey Ullman Show. The song [...] "Those Were the Days" [...] parodies the opening credits of the television show All in the Family. One {{of the people who}} run over the saxophone is <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> tricycle, who promptly falls over. This is {{a reference to}} the show Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In. At the beginning of the flashback, the song [...] "Don't Worry, Be Happy" [...] by Bobby McFerrin can be heard. In the flashback, Dr. Hibbert fashioned his hair and attire like Mr. T in The A-Team. Homer can be seen watching Twin Peaks and The Giant is then shown waltzing with the White Horse. In King Toot's music store, when Homer buys Lisa her first saxophone, there is a guitar in the background that is similar to Eddie Van Halen's [...] "Frankenstrat" [...] guitar.

Reilly regarded the plan as an Edwardian Baroque subversion of the hall's [...] "pure and sublime neo-classical concept". He remarked sarcastically, [...] "What {{was the use of}} a great monumental building if it could not be used as a background to <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> horse?"
