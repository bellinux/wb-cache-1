5|$|The Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU) {{maintains}} air {{and atmospheric}} measurement equipment at Troll. Combined {{with a similar}} measuring station, Zeppelin in Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, Norway. This allows the institute to collect such data from both polar regions. In particular, the facility measures aerosols, organic and inorganic pollution, ozone and ultraviolet (UV) radiation. NILU also creates air samples annually to generate data for trend analysis. The weekly air pollution measurements are compared to equivalent measurements at Zeppelin. Ground measurements are taken of ozone and mercury, two of the greatest pollution threats in the polar regions. Stratosphere measurements are conducted to measure ozone and UV levels, in particular to gain additional information about ozone depletion and the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E

40|$|The Arctic winter 2010 / 2011 was {{characterized}} by an unusually stable and cold polar vortex in the lower stratosphere. Meteorological data shows that conditions {{for the formation of}} polar stratospheric clouds, and hence the activation of chlorine from reservoir species through heterogeneous processes, were widespread. Values of Vpsc, a temperature based parameter that characterizes the winter average extent of such conditions were in the range of the extreme values reached in the coldest winters on record, i. e., 2000 and 2005. However, in contrast to these previous winters, when the ozone loss period was ended by major stratospheric warmings in March, in 2011 the very stable polar vortex stayed intact and cold well into April. The combination of extremely cold conditions throughout the winter with a long lived and stable vortex in spring led to record chemical destruction of ozone in the Arctic. Based on the measurements of the Match ozonesonde network and the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instrument on Aura we will discuss the degree and the time evolution of this record loss and compare the Arctic ozone loss in 2011 with the range of ozone losses that occurred in early and recent <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>holes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The quasi-biennial {{oscillation}} (QBO) in total ozone and temperature has been extracted from 9 years of Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) observations and National Meteorological Center (NMC) analyses. Years in which QBO-related {{variations in the}} total ozone and temperature are positive are found to correspond to years with smaller September <b>Antarctic</b> total <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> decline rates and vice versa. The QBO appears {{to be responsible for}} September decline rate deviations up to 0. 4 Dobson units (DU) per day. Also, the QBO at mid-latitudes appears to be better correlated with the 30 -mbar tropical QBO winds than with those at 50 mbar. Possible mechanisms that would explain these phenomena are discussed...|$|R
25|$|The {{behavior}} {{seen in the}} <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> {{is completely}} different. Instead of staying constant, early springtime ozone levels suddenly drop from their already low winter values, {{by as much as}} 50 percent, and normal values are not reached again until December.|$|E
25|$|Increased solar {{ultraviolet}} radiation {{resulting from the}} <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> has reduced marine primary productivity (phytoplankton) {{by as much as}} 15% and has started damaging the DNA of some fish. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, especially the landing of an estimated five to six times more Patagonian toothfish than the regulated fishery, likely affects the sustainability of the stock. Long-line fishing for toothfish causes a high incidence of seabird mortality.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> {{is an area}} of the Antarctic {{stratosphere}} {{in which}} the recent ozone levels have dropped to as low as 33 percent of their pre-1975 values. The ozone hole occurs during the Antarctic spring, from September to early December, as strong westerly winds start to circulate around the continent and create an atmospheric container. Within this polar vortex, over 50 percent of the lower stratospheric ozone is destroyed during the Antarctic spring.|$|E
40|$|A {{transient}} simulation {{with the}} interactively coupled chemistry-climate model (CCM) E 39 /C {{has been carried}} out which covers the 40 -year period between 1960 and 1999. Forcing of natural and anthropogenic origin is prescribed where the characteristics are sufficiently well known and the typical timescales are slow compared to synoptic timescale so that the simulated atmospheric chemistry and climate evolve under a "slowly" varying external forcing. Based on observations, sea surface temperature (SST) and ice cover are prescribed. The increase of greenhouse gas and chlorofluorocarbon concentrations, as well as nitrogen oxide emissions are taken into account. The 11 -year solar cycle is considered in the calculation of heating rates and photolysis of chemical species. The three major volcanic eruptions during that time (Agung, 1963; El Chichon, 1982; Pinatubo, 1991) are considered. The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) is forced by linear relaxation, also known as nudging, of the equatorial zonal wind in the lower stratosphere towards observed zonal wind profiles. Beyond a reasonable reproduction of mean parameters and long-term variability characteristics there are many apparent features of episodic similarities between simulation and observation: In the years 1986 and 1988 the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>holes</b> are smaller than in the other years of that decade. In mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere ozone anomalies resemble the corresponding observations, especially in 1985, 1989, 1991 / 1992, and 1996. In the Northern Hemisphere, the episode between the late 1980 s and {{the first half of the}} 1990 s is dynamically quiet, in particular, no stratospheric warming is found between 1988 and 1993. As observed, volcanic eruptions strongly influence dynamics and chemistry, though only for few years. Obviously, planetary wave activity is strongly driven by the prescribed SST and modulated by the QBO. Preliminary evidence of realistic cause and effect relationships strongly suggests that detailed process-oriented studies will be a worthwhile endeavour...|$|R
30|$|New {{modeling}} {{studies using}} the Whole Atmospheric Community Climate Model (WACCM) (Smith et al. [2010]) indicate {{a significant role}} {{of the development of}} the <b>Antarctic</b> stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> in long-term trends in the MLTI region. Dramatic ozone loss in the lower stratosphere results in a temperature decrease in the polar lower stratosphere and a change in the zonal wind distribution. Smith et al. (2011) showed that this change modifies gravity wave propagation into the mesosphere during late spring so that the mesospheric residual mean circulation is weakened by the gravity wave drag. This leads to a reduction in polar ascent rates and thus anomalous adiabatic heating and more than a 4 K increase in temperature at 80 km between 1960 and 2006 over the summer pole, and a 6 K cooling above that level. In contrast, little change was seen over the summer pole in the Northern Hemisphere. The mesospheric warming over the Antarctic was not present in a simulation in which ODS concentrations were kept constant at pre-ozone-hole levels. This influence of the <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> in changing wave propagation into the MLTI was later confirmed in simulations using the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM) (Lossow et al. [2012]), although their effect was less pronounced in December in CMAM than WACCM, likely due to too delayed breakup of the polar vortex in WACCM.|$|R
25|$|G.M.B. Dobson (Exploring the Atmosphere, 2nd Edition, Oxford, 1968) {{mentioned}} that when springtime ozone {{levels in the}} Antarctic over Halley Bay were first measured in 1956, {{he was surprised to}} find that they were ~320 DU, or about 150 DU below spring Arctic levels of ~450 DU. These were at that time the only known <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> values available. What Dobson describes is essentially the baseline from which the <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> is measured: actual <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> values are in the 150–100 DU range.|$|R
25|$|Reactions {{that take}} place on polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) play an {{important}} role in enhancing ozone depletion. PSCs form more readily in the extreme cold of the Arctic and Antarctic stratosphere. This is why ozone holes first formed, and are deeper, over Antarctica. Early models failed to take PSCs into account and predicted a gradual global depletion, which is why the sudden <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> was such a surprise to many scientists.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Government's {{attitude}} {{began to}} change again in 1983, when William Ruckelshaus replaced Anne M. Burford as Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Under Ruckelshaus and his successor, Lee Thomas, the EPA pushed for an international approach to halocarbon regulations. In 1985 20 nations, including {{most of the major}} CFC producers, signed the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, which established a framework for negotiating international regulations on ozone-depleting substances. That same year, the discovery of the <b>Antarctic</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> was announced, causing a revival in public attention to the issue. In 1987, representatives from 43 nations signed the Montreal Protocol. Meanwhile, the halocarbon industry shifted its position and started supporting a protocol to limit CFC production. However, this shift was uneven with DuPont acting more quickly than their European counterparts. DuPont may have feared court action related to increased skin cancer especially as the EPA had published a study in 1986 claiming that an additional 40 million cases and 800,000 cancer deaths were to be expected in the U.S. in the next 88 years. The EU shifted its position as well after Germany gave up its defence of the CFC industry and started supporting moves towards regulation. Government and industry in France and the UK tried to defend their CFC producing industries even after the Montreal Protocol had been signed.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014 Snow and ice {{surfaces}} are ubiquitous in the environment. Heterogeneous reactions on those {{surfaces are}} responsible {{for a wide range}} of phenomena such as the <b>Antarctic</b> stratospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>hole,</b> depletion of boundary-layer ozone, and deposition of mercury. Little is known about the location of impurities on ice surfaces or how that structure depends upon temperature and time after contamination. Therefore, we investigated microscopic structures created by depositing sodium chloride particles onto laboratory-grown ice below the hydrohalite-water eutectic temperature. As the temperature was increased above the eutectic, sodium chloride solution (brine) formed around the particle and spread across the air-ice interface. Literature indicated that ice crystal grain boundaries are the most thermodynamically stable site for brine; yet, on our time scale (minutes), the brine does not drain down the grain boundary and is instead present on the ice surface. Either the surface energetics of the system differ from expectations or a barrier inhibits the brine from moving down the grain boundary on the observational timescale. The area of the brine was used to relate surface coverage by our contamination mechanism to bulk composition. We find that brine does not fully coat the surface for typical snow properties...|$|R

40|$|Polar ecosystems, and {{particularly}} Antarctica, {{are one of}} the few environs in which bryophytes dominate the flora. Their success in these regions is due to bryophytes’ ability to withstand an array of harsh conditions through their poikilohydric lifestyle. However, the unique conditions that allow bryophytes to proliferate over other forms of vegetation also create considerable limitations to growth and photosynthetic activity. High latitude areas are already experiencing some of the most pronounced and rapid climatic change, especially in the Arctic, the Sub-Antarctic Islands and Maritime Antarctica, and these are predicted to continue over the next century. This climatic change is already impacting the flora of the polar regions both via direct and/or indirect impacts on plant species. Water availability and temperature are undoubtedly the most influential factors that determine bryophyte productivity in the <b>Antarctic,</b> but the <b>ozone</b> <b>hole</b> is also having an impact either directly via increased ultraviolet-B radiation and/or indirectly through the increasing wind speeds associated with ozone depletion.

Further warming temperatures near the end of spring break up the vortex around mid-December.

Integrations of the total ozone from the South Pole northwards show that a portion of the systematic trend of decreasing <b>Antarctic</b> total <b>ozone</b> (prior to 1985) seems to be due to a redistribution of total ozone to subpolar and midlatitude regions.
