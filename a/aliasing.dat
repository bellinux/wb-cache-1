25|$|<b>Aliasing</b> occurs {{whenever}} {{the use of}} discrete elements to capture or produce a continuous signal causes frequency ambiguity.|$|E
25|$|Temporal <b>aliasing</b> is a {{major concern}} in the {{sampling}} of video and audio signals. Music, for instance, may contain high-frequency components that are inaudible to humans. If a piece of music is sampled at 32000 samples per second (Hz), any frequency components above 16000 Hz (the Nyquist frequency for this sampling rate) will cause <b>aliasing</b> when the music is reproduced by a digital to analog converter (DAC). To prevent this, an anti-aliasing filter is used to remove components above the Nyquist frequency prior to sampling.|$|E
25|$|This <b>aliasing</b> {{is visible}} in images such as posters with {{lenticular}} printing: if they have low angular resolution, then as one moves past them, say from left-to-right, the 2D image does not initially change (so it appears to move left), then as one moves to the next angular image, the image suddenly changes (so it jumps right) – and the frequency and amplitude of this side-to-side movement corresponds to the angular resolution of the image (and, for frequency, {{the speed of the}} viewer's lateral movement), which is the angular <b>aliasing</b> of the 4D light field.|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we address}} coreference retrieval, which {{involves}} identifying <b>aliases</b> that are distinct references to an entity. We {{begin with a}} known <b>alias</b> and discover unknown <b>aliases</b> that refer to the same entity. We use Entity Language Models to capture the contextual language around the known <b>alias,</b> which aids in finding new <b>aliases.</b> We also show that modeling the significant dates of the known <b>aliases</b> improves <b>alias</b> discovery performance...|$|R

25|$|When {{interactions}} between factors are not negligible, {{they are often}} confounded in Plackett–Burman designs with the main effects, meaning that the designs do not permit one to distinguish between certain main effects and certain interactions.

25|$|The <b>aliasing</b> {{distortion}} in {{the lower}} frequencies is increasingly obvious with higher fundamental frequencies, and while the bandlimited sawtooth is still clear at 1760Hz, the aliased sawtooth is degraded and harsh with a buzzing audible at frequencies lower than the fundamental.|$|E
25|$|In signal {{processing}} and related disciplines, <b>aliasing</b> is an effect that causes different signals to become indistinguishable (or aliases of one another) when sampled.

25|$|The Perl 6 {{specification}} requests that modules {{are identified}} by name, version and authority.

25|$|A form {{of spatial}} <b>aliasing</b> can also occur in antenna arrays or {{microphone}} arrays {{used to estimate}} the direction of arrival of a wave signal, as in geophysical exploration by seismic waves. Waves must be sampled at more than two points per wavelength, or the wave arrival direction becomes ambiguous.|$|E
25|$|Sinusoids are an {{important}} type of periodic function, because realistic signals are often modeled as the summation of many sinusoids of different frequencies and different amplitudes (for example, with a Fourier series or transform). Understanding what <b>aliasing</b> does to the individual sinusoids is useful in understanding what happens to their sum.|$|E

According to the police the suspects had confessed to the assassination and claimed it was as result of Thangathurai's co-operation with the Sri Lankan government. In October 1999 seven people - Sivaprakasam Akilarupan <b>alias</b> Ahilson, Navaneethan Jeevakumar <b>alias</b> Jeyanth, Muttiah Koneswaran <b>alias</b> Babu, Manikkam Murugathasan <b>alias</b> Jerome, Satkunanathan Nijanthan <b>alias</b> Nijan, Ratnam Yogambal and Karthigesu Yogaranee - were charged {{with the murder of}} Thangathurai and six others.

50|$|<b>Aliases</b> may be {{registered}} upon initial alien registration.

25|$|Larger-than-necessary {{values of}} fs (smaller values of T), called oversampling, {{have no effect}} on the outcome of the {{reconstruction}} and have the benefit of leaving room for a transition band in which H(f) is free to take intermediate values.

25|$|ClearType is {{not used}} when {{printing}} text. Most printers already use such small pixels that <b>aliasing</b> is rarely a problem, and they don't have the addressable fixed subpixels ClearType requires. Nor does ClearType affect text stored in files. ClearType only applies any processing to the text while it is being rendered onto the screen.|$|E
25|$|Gaussian {{blurring}} {{is commonly}} used when reducing {{the size of an}} image. When downsampling an image, it is common to apply a low-pass filter to the image prior to resampling. This is to ensure that spurious high-frequency information does not appear in the downsampled image (<b>aliasing).</b> Gaussian blurs have nice properties, such as having no sharp edges, and thus do not introduce ringing into the filtered image.|$|E
