50|$|Treatment of post-menopausal {{women and}} people with osteogenesis imperfecta {{over the age of}} 22 with <b>alendronic</b> <b>acid</b> has {{demonstrated}} normalization of the rate of bone turnover, significant increase in BMD (bone mineral density) of the spine, hip, wrist and total body, and significant reductions in the risk of vertebral (spine) fractures, wrist fractures, hip fractures, and all non-vertebral fractures. In the Fracture Intervention Trial, the women with the highest risk of fracture (by virtue of pre-existing vertebral fractures) were treated with Fosamax 5 mg/day for two years followed by 10 mg/day for the third year. This resulted in approximately 50% reductions in fractures of the spine, hip, and wrist compared with the control group taking placebos. Both groups also took calcium and vitamin D.|$|E
50|$|After {{approving}} the drug on 8 July 2009, the European Medicines Agency conducted a class review of all bisphosphonates, including Zoledronate, after several cases of atypical fractures were reported. In 2008, the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Working Party (PhVWP) noted that <b>alendronic</b> <b>acid</b> {{was associated with}} an increased risk of atypical fracture of the femur that developed with low or no trauma. In April 2010, the PhVWP noted that further data from both the published literature and post-marketing reports were now available which suggested that atypical stress fractures of the femur may be a class effect. The European Medicines Agency then reviewed all case reports of stress fractures in patients treated with bisphosphonates, relevant data from the published literature, and data provided by the companies which market bisphosphonates. The Agency recommended that doctors who prescribe bisphosphonate-containing medicines should be aware that atypical fractures may occur rarely in the femur, especially after long-term use, and that doctors who are prescribing these medicines for the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis should regularly review the need for continued treatment, especially after five or more years of use.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effects of <b>alendronic</b> <b>acid</b> once weekly relative to risedronic acid once weekly on bone mineral density (BMD), markers of bone turnover and tolerability in the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Methods: This was a randomised, double-masked, double-dummy multicentre international study (75 centres in 27 countries in Europe, the Americas and Asia-Pacific). A total of 1303 women were screened and 936 with low bone density (T-score <=- 2. 0 at the spine, hip trochanter, total hip or femoral neck) were randomised; 91 % (n = 854) completed the study. Patients were randomised to treatment with either active <b>alendronic</b> <b>acid</b> 70 mg weekly (Fosamax((R))) and placebo identical to risedronic acid weekly or active risedronic acid 35 mg weekly (Actonel((R))) and placebo identical to <b>alendronic</b> <b>acid</b> weekly for 12 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage change from baseline in hip trochanter BMD at 12 months. Secondary endpoints included the percentage change from baseline in lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck BMD; biochemical markers of bone turnover (including serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase [BSAP] and urinary type I collagen N-telopeptides [NTx]); and safety and tolerability as assessed by reporting of adverse experiences. Results: <b>Alendronic</b> <b>acid</b> produced greater increases in BMD than did risedronic acid at 12 months at all sites measured. Mean percentage increases from baseline in hip trochanter BMD at month 12 were 3. 56 % and 2. 71 % in the <b>alendronic</b> <b>acid</b> and risedronic acid groups, respectively (treatment difference [95 % CI]: 0. 83 % [0. 22, 1. 45; p = 0. 0081). Mean percentage increases from baseline were greater with <b>alendronic</b> <b>acid</b> than risedronic acid at the lurnbar spine, total hip and femoral neck BMD at month 12 (p = 0. 002, p < 0. 001, p = 0. 039, respectively). Increases in BMD with <b>alendronic</b> <b>acid</b> compared with risedronic acid were also significantly greater at 6 months at the trochanter and total kip. There was a greater reduction in bone turnover with <b>alendronic</b> <b>acid</b> compared with risedronic acid: NTx decreased 58 % with <b>alendronic</b> <b>acid</b> compared with 47 % with risedronic acid at 12 months (p < 0. 00 1); and BSAP decreased 45 % with <b>alendronic</b> <b>acid</b> compared with 34 % with risedronic acid at 12 months (p < 0. 001). Overall tolerability and upper gastrointestinal tolerability were similar for both agents. Conclusions: <b>Alendronic</b> <b>acid</b> once weekly produced greater BMD increases at both hip and spine sites and greater reductions in bone turnover relative to risedronic acid once weekly. Both agents were well tolerated with no significant difference in upper gastrointestinal adverse experiences.

40|$|Bisphosphonates are {{the most}} widely {{prescribed}} drugs in osteoporosis today. They have unequivocally shown their ability to reduce fracture rate at the spine (<b>alendronic</b> <b>acid,</b> risedronic acid, ibandronic acid) and at the hip (<b>alendronic</b> <b>acid</b> and risedronic acid). However, their dosage and administration procedures and the adverse reactions induced by their oral intake are responsible for low adherence. Therefore, intermittent regimens have been developed.

40|$|In January 2005 the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales {{provided}} new {{guidance on}} the use of anti-osteoporosis therapies for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures. This was shortly followed in the same year by market authorisation of a generic form of <b>alendronic</b> <b>acid.</b> We here set out to estimate the actual practice impact of these events among hip fracture patients in terms of anti-osteoporosis medicationprescribing and subsequent fracture incidence using primary care data (Clinical Practice Research Datalink) from 1999 - 2013. Changes in level and trend of prescribing and subsequent fracture following publication of NICE guidance and availability of generic <b>alendronic</b> <b>acid</b> were estimated using an interrupted time series analysis. Both events were considered in combination within a 1 -year ‘intervention period’. We identified 10, 873 primary hip fracture patients between April 1999 and Sept 2012. Taking into account prior trend, the intervention period was associated with an immediate absolute increase of 14. 9 % (95 % C. I. 10. 9 – 18. 9) for incident anti-osteoporosis prescriptions and a significant and clinically important reduction in subsequent major and subsequent hip fracture: - 0. 19 % (95 % C. I. - 0. 28 to - 0. 09) and - 0. 17 % (95 % C. I. - 0. 26 to - 0. 09) per six months, respectively. This equated to an approximate 14 % (major) and 22 % (hip) reduction at three years post-intervention relative to expected values based solely on pre-intervention level and trend.

40|$|Background: In {{the past}} few years, the {{occurrence}} of an oral lesion, called osteonecrosis of the jaw, has increasingly been reported in patients undergoing treatment with systemic bisphosphonates (BPs); however, few papers dealing with oral biphosphonates related osteonecrosis of the jaws (BRONJ) {{can be found in}} the literature. The purpose of the present case was to report an occurrence of BRONJ after implant insertion. Case report: Ten years ago, eight dental implants were inserted in the jaw of a 65 -year-old female. After 5 years of treatment with <b>alendronic</b> <b>acid,</b> a breakdown of the oral mucosa covering the implants occurred with a purulent discharge in the left side of the jaw; periapical radiolucency was present around both distal implants. An en-block resection of the alveolar bone including the two implants was performed. Thirthy-five hyperbaric sessions were taken and no signs of recurrence of the lesion were observed after a follow-up of 20 months. Before the new implant insertion, the patient had suspended the treatment with <b>alendronic</b> <b>acid</b> for 6 months. At the interface of one of the implants, a gap was observed between bone and implant. This bone was non vital, and many osteocyte lacunae were empty.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the synthesis, characterisation and structures of new geminal bisphosphonate complexes and ion-pair salts, mainly featuring (4 -amino- 1 -hydroxybutylidene) - 1, 1 -bisphosphonate (alendronate) ions. These include Group 1 (Chapter 2), Group 2 (Chapter 4), first row transition (Appendix 3) and lanthanoid metal (Appendix 1) alendronate complexes. They also include aminium ion-pair salts containing alendronate (Chapter 3) {{and two other}} related geminal bisphosphonates (Chapter 5). The Introduction (Chapter 1) discusses the fundamental properties and chemistry of the anions, cations and the bases used, with emphasis placed on <b>alendronic</b> <b>acid</b> and its’ compounds. The Introduction also includes a discussion {{of some of the}} biological aspects of geminal bisphosphonic acids. New crystal structures feature supramolecular assembles with extensive hydrogen bonding. The strongest hydrogen bonding occurred between -PO₂(OH) - and the -PO₃²⁻ groups i. e. –O₂P-O-H…O-PO₂- in doubly deprotonated alendronate ions. Presumably, this occurred to partly delocalise the charge on the two phosphonate groups. The alendronate anion showed an exceptional ability to coordinate to metal cations through a variety of different bonding modes, this possibility being alluded to in the Introduction. Geminal bisphosphonate anions have an affinity for metal ions because they are multi-oxygen donors and can be multiply charged. The varied binding modes can lead to polymorphism, exemplified by [Rb(H₄L) (H₂O) ]. H₂O and [Cs(H₄L) (H₂O) ]. H₂O (where H₅L = <b>alendronic</b> <b>acid)</b> and variable hydration (e. g. K₂(H₃L). 3 H₂O and [K(H₃L) (μ-H₂O) ₂K(H₂O) ₄]). An unusual [Rb(H₄L) (H₅L) ]. 2 H₂O structure is described which contained an uncharged <b>alendronic</b> <b>acid</b> moiety. The structure of an unexpected bimetallic complex [Cu₅ (H₂L) ₄Na₂(H₂O) ₈]. 5 H₂O, containing a triply deprotonated alendronate ion bound to Cu and Na ions, was elucidated. [Li(H₄L) (H₂O) ₂] was a mononuclear structure and all other compounds were coordination polymers. The Group 1 metal complexes are soluble and the growing of crystals was complicated by polymorphism and different hydrate formations. The Group 2, transition and lanthanoid complexes are insoluble in polar solvents making it difficult to grow crystals to use for structural evaluation. This was a major impediment to the initial thrust of the research. The ion-pair aminium alendronate salts were all soluble. None of them were ionic liquids (melting points < 100 °C). Although some salts appeared to melt close to 100 °C, this process mainly involved the loss of waters of crystallisation. The aminium salts feature several types of ring motifs which add to their structural stability. Hydrogen bonding also contributed to structural integrity and one salt contained as many as 38 such bonds. The alendronate anion has characteristic infrared absorption bands, of strong intensity, with the symmetric P-O stretching bands near 1040 cm⁻¹ clearly evident. The solid state phosphorus NMR spectra, although complex to interpret, proved a useful tool in identifying different phosphorus environments and in providing evidence that some compounds existed as polymorphs. The geometry of the alendronate anion was essentially unchanged when coordinated to a metal cation...|$|E

40|$|Few {{cases of}} hip {{fracture}} in pregnant women affected by transient osteoporosis of the femoral head {{have been reported}} in the literature, but its real incidence seems to be underestimated. During pregnancy, osteoporosis manifests itself with an insidious onset of hip pain and limp without any trauma or infective episode in clinical history. Its clinical course is characterized by spontaneous recovery a few weeks to several months after delivery. This article describes the case of a 35 -year-old woman with a sudden onset of bilateral hip pain during the last trimester of her first pregnancy; she had neither history of steroid therapy nor alcohol abuse; her body temperature and serological parameters were normal. Bilateral transient osteoporosis of the femoral heads was suspected and confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. Fifteen days postpartum, she was admitted to our clinic with a displaced femoral neck fracture. A cementless total hip arthroplasty was performed to quickly begin a rehabilitative program. She underwent antiresorptive therapy with <b>alendronic</b> <b>acid</b> 70 mg/week and vitamin D for 3 months. Three months after the fracture, a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan showed osteopenia (T-score, - 1. 5). Risedronic acid 35 mg/week and vitamin D were then prescribed. The last physical examination at 3 months postoperatively revealed a gradual recovery of the autonomy in activities of daily life...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{dramatic}} change in the therapeutic approach to patients with Paget's disease of bone over the last 40 years. In the 1960 s, only symptomatic therapy could be given, with control of pain the main objective. Analgesics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the most commonly used agents. From 1968 onwards, antiosteoclastic agents became available, including calcitonin, plicamycin (mithramycin) and etidronate (etidronic acid), a first-generation bisphosphonate. Limitations with these agents, including potentially deleterious effects on bone mineralization with etidronate (etidronic acid), has cleared the way for increasingly potent second- and third-generation bisphosphonates, including clodronate (clodronic acid), pamidronate (pamidronic acid), alendronate (<b>alendronic</b> <b>acid)</b> and risedronate (risedronic acid). Even more potent bisphosphonates will become available in the near future. With the newer bisphosphonates, there is some hope for long-term remission (if not definitive healing) of pagetic lesions, as well as prevention of long-term complications in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Thus, indications for therapy have been extended to include younger patients to prevent bone deformity of the limbs and skull, leading to secondary osteoarthritis, facial deformities and potentially to sarcoma transformation; as well as to elderly patients to prevent bone fragility, leading to fracture, and pagetic vascular steal syndromes. The increased potency and longer duration of action of newer bisphosphonates more than compensates for their marginally increased cost compared with older bisphosphonates...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} cost {{effectiveness}} of nasal calcitonin (Miacalcin(R)) compared with no therapy, alendronate or etidronate {{in the treatment}} of postmenopausal women with previous osteoporotic fracture. Design and setting: Meta-analysis followed by economic analysis. Perspective: A Canadian provincial Ministry of Health. Methods: The meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials was based on the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration. Economic analysis was conducted within a Markov model using probabilities and costs derived from Canadian sources. Results: The meta-analysis found evidence of the positive effect of both nasal calcitonin and alendronate in reducing the risks of hip, wrist and vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women. However, {{there was a lack of}} evidence of the effect of etidronate on hip and wrist fractures. For a 65 -year-old woman, with 5 years' therapy, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for nasal calcitonin was 46 500 Canadian dollars ($Can) compared with no therapy and $Can 32 600 compared with etidronate (1998 values). Comparison with alendronate was highly sensitive to the inclusion of one specific trial. Conclusions: Given the results of the analysis, based on current evidence, nasal calcitonin can be considered at the margins of being cost effective when compared with no therapy. Compared with active therapy, nasal calcitonin can be considered more cost effective than etidronate, but its cost effectiveness versus alendronate is inconclusive. <b>Alendronic</b> <b>acid,</b> Antihypercalcaemics, Calcitonin, Cost effectiveness, Etidronic acid, Menopause, Meta analysis, Pharmacoeconomics, Postmenopausal osteoporosis...|$|E
40|$|Reactions of <b>alendronic</b> <b>acid</b> (= LH 5) {{with group}} 1 metal bases KOH, KHCO 3, Rb 2 CO 3, RbOH, or Cs 2 CO 3 gave the {{corresponding}} complexes [M(LH 4) (H 2 O) n]·m(H 2 O), M = K, Rb, or Cs. Crystallization {{of the products}} under varying conditions yielded differing hydrates and/or polymorphic phases. Reactions of (4 -amino- 1 -hydroxybutylidine) - 1, 1 -bisphosphonic acid (<b>alendronic</b> <b>acid</b> = LH 5) with 1 equiv of the group 1 metal bases KOH, KHCO 3, Rb 2 CO 3, RbOH, or Cs 2 CO 3 in aqueous solution at pH 4 – 5 gave the corresponding complexes [M(LH 4) (H 2 O) n]·m(H 2 O), M = K (1), Rb (2), or Cs (3). Crystallization of the products under varying conditions yielded differing hydrates and/or polymorphic phases. Rapid crystallization of the potassium complex 1 from water/EtOH or water/DMSO gave 2 [K(LH 4) ]· 3 (H 2 O) (1 a), whereas slow crystallization from water or water/DMSO gave [K 2 (LH 4) 2 (H 2 O) 2]· 2 H 2 O (1 b phase I). For the rubidium complex 2, rapid crystallization from water/EtOH gave the analogous [Rb 2 (LH 4) 2 (H 2 O) 2]· 2 H 2 O (2 b phase I), whereas slow crystallization from water/DMSO also gave 2 b, but as a mixture of phase I and the structural polymorph [Rb(LH 4) (H 2 O) ]·H 2 O (2 b phase II). In contrast, only [Cs(LH 4) (H 2 O) ]·H 2 O (3 b phase II) was obtained for the cesium complex 3 under all crystallization conditions. A second complex type [M(LH 4) (LH 5) ]· 2 H 2 O (M = Rb 4, Cs 5), incorporating an additional coordinated <b>alendronic</b> <b>acid</b> molecule, was also observed for the larger metals Rb and Cs as a minor product in some syntheses and isolated by fractional crystallization for 4, but as the sole product from Cs(O 2 CH) and LH 5 for 5. The crystal structures of the complexes [M(LH 4) (H 2 O) n]·m(H 2 O) 1 a, 2 b (phase II), and 3 b (phase II) comprise edge-shared or corner-shared polyhedral chains that are linked by bridging bisphosphonate ligands into two-dimensional (2 -D) sheets. The 4 -ammoniobutylidene chains protrude {{above and below the}} coordination layers and interact with neighboring layers through hydrogen bonding of the terminal ammonium group forming distinctive supramolecular three-dimensional (3 -D) arrays. The phase I structure of 1 b and 2 b comprises ribbons of parallel M 4 (LH 4) 4 (H 2 O) 4 subunits arranged in a more close packed 3 -D supramolecular network. For [M(LH 4) (LH 5) ]· 2 H 2 O (M = Rb 4, Cs 5), isolated M+ cations, bridged by bisphosphonate ligands, are arranged into 2 -D sheets, with the pendant 4 -ammoniumbutylidene chains resulting in a 3 -D lamellar network similar to those of 1 a and 2 b/ 3 b (phase II). All of the [M(LH 4) (H 2 O) n]·m(H 2 O) and [M(LH 4) (LH 5) ]· 2 H 2 O structures display strong PO–H···O(phosphonate) and N–H···O(phosphonate/water) hydrogen bond motifs which significantly impact the observed structures. Reactions of LH 5 with 2 equiv of the group 1 metal bases MOH (M = Na, K, Rb, Cs) at pH 9 – 10 gave the dimetalated complexes [M 2 (LH 3) (H 2 O) n]·m(H 2 O) (M = Na 6, K 7, Rb 8, Cs 9). Crystallization of 6 from water/MeOH gave [Na 2 (LH 3) (H 2 O) 4]·H 2 O (6 a) as a single phase. For 7, crystallization from water/MeOH gave K 2 (LH 3) · 3 (H 2 O) (7 a) as the bulk product, whereas crystals of [K 2 (LH 3) (H 2 O) 6] (7 b) were grown from water/DMSO solutions. On standing, the crystals of 7 b were converted into the bulk product 7 a. The structures of 6 a and 7 b are chain rather than sheet bisphosphonate coordination polymers, with a high number of coordinated water molecules. Moreover, their 3 -D supramolecular structures are distinguishable, viz. a pillared array for 6 a and a more compact bilayer structure for 7 b. The [M 2 (LH 3) (H 2 O) n]·m(H 2 O) complexes of the larger group 1 metal cations 8 and 9 each crystallized as a mixture of phases. Crystals of [Rb 2 (LH 3) (H 2 O) 5]·(H 2 O) (8 a) and [Cs 4 (LH 3) 2 (H 2 O) 9]· 2 (H 2 O) (9 a), respectively, were identified as the major component after crystallization from DMSO/H 2 O. The lesser hydrates [Rb 4 (LH 3) 2 (H 2 O) 8]·(H 2 O) (8 b) and [Cs 2 (LH 3) (H 2 O) 4] (9 b) were also identified, but were not isolated as bulk materials. The structures of 8 a, 8 b, 9 a, and 9 b each were complex 2 -D sheets of bisphosphonate metal coordination polymers, which assembled through supramolecular interactions into compact 3 -D arrays...|$|E
40|$|Drug {{interactions}} {{may represent}} an iatrogenic risk {{that should be}} controlled in community pharmacies at the dispensing level. Aim: We analyzed the association between potential drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and negative clinical outcomes. Methods: We used dispensing data from two community pharmacies: instances where drug dispensing {{was associated with a}} potential DDI and a comparison group of randomized dispensing operations with no potential DDI. In cases where potential DDIs were detected, we analyzed the underlying negative clinical outcomes. Age and gender data were included in the analysis. Results: During the study period, we registered 417 potential DDIs. The proportion of women and age were higher in the study group than in the comparison group. The average potential DDIs per patient was 1. 31 (SD= 0. 72). The Consejo General de Colegios Oficiales de Farmacéuticos (CGCOF) database did not produce an alert in 2. 4 % of the cases. Over-the-counter medication use was observed in 5 % of the potential DDI cases. The drugs most frequently involved in potential DDIs were acenocoumarol, calcium salts, hydrochlorothiazide, and <b>alendronic</b> <b>acid,</b> whereas the most predominant potential DDIs were calcium salts and bisphosphonates, oral antidiabetics and thiazide diuretics, antidiabetics and glucose, and oral anticoagulant and paracetamol. The existence of a drug-related negative clinical outcome was observed only in 0. 96 % of the potential DDI cases (50 % safety cases and 50 % effectiveness cases). Conclusions: Only a small proportion of the detected potential DDIs lead to medication negative outcomes. Considering the drug-related negative clinical outcomes encountered, tighter control would be recommended in potential DDIs with NSAIDs or benzodiazepines...|$|E
40|$|Background and objective: Osteoporosis is a {{major health}} threat nowadays. Aging of the {{population}} and changes in peoples’ lifestyle result in a constant {{increase in the number of}} fractures all over the world. Our study aimed at describing the drug utilization pattern and choice of active substances of antiosteoporotic medicines in the Baltic countries. Materials and methods: Sales data of the antiosteoporotic medicines was obtained from the internet. These are available on the website of medicines regulatory agencies. The World Health Organization (WHO) methodology of Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification and defined daily dose (DDD) was used to compare the data among countries. Results: During the study period the consumption of antiosteoporotic medicines was rather stable in all the countries. The overall choice of active substances used to treat osteoporosis is similar in all the Baltic countries but the market shares of substances were different. Estonia stands out with high use of combination product of <b>alendronic</b> <b>acid</b> and colecalciferol. In Latvia the highest consumption was of risedronic acid. In Lithuania the most used active substance in 2014 was ibandronic acid and second was denosumab with 0. 8 daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day (DID) and 25 % of the total share. Conclusions: The differences in consumption of drugs against osteoporosis in the Baltic countries are not very big. The consumption of antiosteoporotic drugs is not to be regarded as sufficient though. The generally low consumption of osteoporotic medicines in the Baltic countries can be attributed to the overall less than EU average wealth of the countries and less than optimal expenditure on healthcare out of the GDP...|$|E
