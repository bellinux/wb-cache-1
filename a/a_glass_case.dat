5|$|In {{the museum}} Casa de la Libertad at Sucre, Bolivia, {{there is an}} Argentine flag, {{protected}} by <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>case</b> and in a deteriorated condition, which they {{claim to be the}} original one raised by Belgrano for first time in 1812. The ensign was one of two abandoned and hidden inside a small church near Macha after the battle of Ayohuma, during the retreat from Upper Peru in 1813. The other flag was given back to Argentina by the Bolivian authorities in 1896.|$|E
5|$|Szczerbiec {{is owned}} by the Wawel Royal Castle National Art Collection (inventory number 137) in Kraków, the former capital city of Poland. As the only {{preserved}} of Polish medieval coronation insignia, it is a prominent part of the museum's Treasury and Armory permanent exhibition. The sword is suspended horizontally inside <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>case</b> {{in the middle of the}} Jagiełło and Hedwig Vault located on the ground floor in the northeastern corner of the Wawel Castle.|$|E
5|$|Corder's {{skeleton}} was put {{on display}} in <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>case</b> in the West Suffolk Hospital, and apparently was rigged with a mechanism that made its arm point to the collection box when approached. Eventually, the skull was removed by Dr John Kilner, who wanted to add it to his extensive collection of Red Barn memorabilia. After a series of unfortunate events, he became convinced that the skull was cursed and handed it on to a friend named Hopkins. Further disasters plagued both men, and they finally paid for the skull {{to be given a}} Christian burial in an attempt to lift the supposed curse.|$|E
50|$|Twin Fawns (2000-current): {{based on}} taxidermied unborn twin baby fawns in <b>a</b> uterine <b>glass</b> <b>case.</b> The Twin Fawns exhibit exaggerated {{features}} and cartoon-like appearance. The fawns are depicted as sleeping peacefully in <b>an</b> artificial <b>glass</b> womb-like <b>case</b> {{constructed by the}} artist.|$|R

5|$|In {{front of}} the Presiding Officers' desk is the {{parliamentary}} mace, which is made from silver and inlaid with gold panned from Scottish rivers and inscribed with the words: Wisdom, Compassion, Justice and Integrity. The words There shall be a Scottish Parliament, which are the first words of the Scotland Act, are inscribed around {{the head of the}} mace, which has a ceremonial role in the meetings of Parliament, representing the authority of the Parliament to make laws. Presented to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen upon Parliament's official opening in July 1999, the mace is displayed in <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>case,</b> suspended from the lid. At the beginning of each sitting in the chamber, the lid of the case is rotated so that the mace is above the glass, to symbolise that a full meeting of the Parliament is taking place.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor and Clara {{attend the}} ceremony, where the Doctor {{explains}} {{that since the}} Rings were settled {{there has been a}} constant song sung to keep an angry god asleep. The people fear that the god, which they call Grandfather, will awaken and consume the entire universe if the song is ever interrupted. Merry begins singing, joined by a chorister at the pyramid. During the song, a mummy in <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>case</b> at the pyramid begins to awaken. Merry panics, believing she got the song wrong. A beam of light from the pyramid envelops her, and she is pulled toward the pyramid and the mummy. The Doctor and Clara find Dor'een and rent the space bike using Clara's mother's ring as payment. They ride the bike to the pyramid where they find the mummy struggling to escape the case and consume Merry's soul. The Doctor promises Merry that she does not have to sacrifice herself and that he will stop Grandfather. As they attempt to leave, a group of creatures called the Vigil arrive and attempt to force Merry to sacrifice herself. The Doctor holds the Vigil at bay long enough to let Clara and Merry escape from the throne room, but then the case shatters and the mummy breaks free. A ray of light strikes the planet, revealing that Grandfather is Akhaten itself, a planet-sized parasitic creature.|$|E
25|$|In stark {{contrast}} to the majestic synagogue, the simple wooden chair and shtender used by Rabbi Aharon Rokeach when he came to Israel in 1944 stand in <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>case</b> next to the ark.|$|E

25|$|His {{remains were}} exhumed for the {{collection}} of first and second-class relics on August 1, 2017. His remains were placed in a new black casket and reinterred in <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>case</b> instead of the previous wooden sarcophagus.|$|E
25|$|On {{his death}} in 1960 he was stuffed and {{returned}} to Wimbledon Station. He continued to collect for the Homes, in <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>case</b> situated on Platform 5, until 1990 when he retired once more and {{became part of the}} National Railway Collection.|$|E
25|$|Between 1962 and 2016 London Stone {{was located}} {{on the north side}} of Cannon Street, {{opposite}} Cannon Street station, housed in an aperture in the wall of number 111 Cannon Street (London EC4N 5AR), surrounded by a decorative Portland stone fascia with an iron grille. Inside the building it was protected by <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>case.</b> The stone and its surround, with the iron grille, were designated a Grade II* listed structure on 5 June 1972.|$|E
50|$|A popular {{seasonal}} {{item in the}} 1960s was a beehive in <b>an</b> acrylic <b>glass</b> <b>case</b> with <b>an</b> exit {{through a}} side window, allowing visitors to the museum to see the bees {{at work in the}} hive.|$|R
50|$|Now {{retired from}} active duty, Shakey is {{currently}} on view in <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> display <b>case</b> at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. The project inspired numerous other robotics projects, most notably the Centibots.|$|R
50|$|Decorative {{lanterns}} {{exist in}} a wide range of designs. Some hang from buildings, while others are placed on or just above the ground. Paper lanterns occur in societies around the world. Modern varieties often place an electric light in <b>a</b> decorative <b>glass</b> <b>case.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{body was}} first put {{on display in}} the Eden Museum. Because it drew such large crowds city {{authorities}} insisted that the body be moved and closed the exhibit. The body then became part of a freak show in a Montreal circus. When the show went bankrupt the body was abandoned and left in a warehouse. In 1907, the body was found by a group of children. It was subsequently claimed by the University of Montreal for research purposes. The body was later mummified and put on display in <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1995, with {{producer}} and friend Joanna Scanlan, Swinton developed a performance/installation live art {{piece in the}} Serpentine Gallery, London, where she was on display {{to the public for}} a week, asleep or apparently so, in <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>case,</b> as a piece of performance art. The piece is sometimes wrongly credited to Cornelia Parker, whom Swinton invited to collaborate for the installation in London. The performance, entitled The Maybe, was repeated in 1996 at the Museo Barracco in Rome and in 2013 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{the video}} was planned to feature {{the story of}} a delicate-hearted protagonist, played by Yamaguchi, who is put into <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>case</b> while evil and hypocritical events {{happened}} in the world outside the case. After discussions with the band, the plan for the video changed: the protagonist was kept, and instead the video featured a story where the protagonist was hurt by different characters and by society, culminating in a scene where he lost something important to him. The video was recorded like a theatrical play, and incorporated optical illusions created by stage techniques.|$|E
50|$|A {{recently}} unemployed married man, Bill {{was once}} obsessed with comic books, especially Coyote Man, and its creator, Don Wong, keeping a sandwich made by Magda, with one bite from Don Wong in <b>a</b> sterilized <b>glass</b> <b>case</b> {{in the center}} of the living room.|$|R
50|$|On {{display at}} the museum is the Academy Award that Shelley Winters won, and later donated to the museum, for her {{performance}} as Petronella van Daan in the 1959 film The Diary of Anne Frank. The award now sits in <b>a</b> bullet-proof <b>glass</b> <b>case</b> in the museum.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{fourteen}} [...] "very small, chubby glyphs" [...] {{are visible}} on the four lines of side a, of which only three are complete. Side b is unknown since the fragment is kept in <b>a</b> protective <b>glass</b> <b>case,</b> and evidently {{no one has ever}} investigated the reverse (Fischer 1997).|$|R
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{dramatic}} parts of the museum is the Cast Courts in the sculpture wing, comprising two large, skylighted rooms two storeys high housing hundreds of plaster casts of sculptures, friezes and tombs. One of these is dominated by a full-scale replica of Trajan's Column, cut in half to fit under the ceiling. The other includes reproductions of various works of Italian Renaissance sculpture and architecture, including a full-size replica of Michelangelo's David. Replicas of two earlier Davids by Donatello and Verrocchio, are also included, although for conservation reasons the Verrocchio replica is displayed in <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E
25|$|Comanche was {{reputed to}} be the only {{survivor}} of the Little Bighorn, but quite a few Seventh Cavalry mounts survived, probably more than one hundred, and there was even a yellow bulldog. Comanche lived on another fifteen years, and when he died, he was stuffed and to this day remains in <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>case</b> at the University of Kansas. So, protected from moths and souvenir hunters by his humidity-controlled glass case, Comanche stands patiently, enduring generation after generation of undergraduate jokes. The other horses are gone, and the mysterious yellow bulldog is gone, which means that in a sense the legend is true. Comanche alone survived.|$|E
25|$|Maxwell {{illustrated}} multiple {{books and}} magazine serials for Pearl S. Buck {{for over a}} decade, including the portrait of the author’s mother for {{the cover of the}} 1935 book, The Exile, and the companion portrait of her father for the cover of her 1936 book, Fighting Angel in addition to his illustrations of the serialized editions of these two books in Woman's Home Companion from 1935-1937. Mrs. Buck was the first American woman to be awarded both the Pulitzer Prize (1932) and Nobel Prize (1938) for literature, and these book illustrations are encased along with Buck's Nobel Prize in <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>case</b> at the Green Hills Farm in Perkasie, Pennsylvania.|$|E
60|$|During his wanderings {{he entered}} a {{millinery}} shop, {{and was surprised to}} see within <b>a</b> large <b>glass</b> <b>case</b> <b>a</b> great number of women's hats, each bearing in one position or another a stuffed bird. Indeed, some of the most elaborate hats had two or three birds upon them.|$|R
50|$|Also {{restored}} a 15-ft long medieval altarpiece to a Suffolk church {{after an}} eight-year plan. Estimated {{to be worth}} millions, the altarpiece {{is thought to have}} been created in the 1330s for a Dominican Priory in Norfolk. It now stands in <b>a</b> protective <b>glass</b> <b>case</b> in St Mary's Church, Thornham Parva.|$|R
50|$|Comme Des Garcons: 2009 saw {{the second}} {{collaboration}} of Cutler and Gross with Comme Des Garcons. The 'Future of Black' limited edition collection {{consisted of three}} designs, all fitted with extra dark grey tinted lenses to create a totally black look. The <b>glasses</b> came inside <b>a</b> unique <b>glasses</b> <b>case</b> covered in Comme des Garcons's own fabric.|$|R
25|$|In October 1926, Seppala took Togo and {{his team}} on a tour from Seattle to California, and then across the Midwest to New England, and {{consistently}} drew huge crowds. They were featured at Madison Square Garden in New York City for 10 days, and Togo received a gold medal from Roald Amundsen. In New England Seppala's team of Siberian huskies ran in many races, easily defeating the local Chinooks. Seppala sold most of his team to a kennel in Poland Spring, Maine, and most huskies in the U.S. are descended from one of these dogs. Seppala visited Togo, until he was euthanised on December 5, 1929. After his death, Seppala had Togo preserved and mounted, and today the dog is on display in <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>case</b> at the Iditarod museum in Wasilla, Alaska.|$|E
25|$|The King's' mascot, Reggie the Lion, {{went missing}} in the 1990s and was {{recovered}} after being found dumped in a field. It was restored {{at the cost of}} around £15,000 and then placed on display in the students' union. It is in <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>case</b> and filled with concrete to prevent theft, particularly by UCL students who once castrated it. In turn, King's' students are also believed to have once stolen Phineas, a UCL mascot. It is often claimed that King's' students played football with the embalmed head of Jeremy Bentham. Although the head was indeed stolen, the football story is a myth or legend which is unsupported by official UCL documentation about Bentham available next to his display case (his auto-icon) in the UCL cloisters. The head is now kept in the UCL vaults.|$|E
25|$|McDaniel's last {{will and}} {{testament}} of December 1951 bequeathed her Oscar to Howard University, {{where she had}} been honored by the students with a luncheon after she had won her Oscar. At the time of her death, McDaniel would have had few options. Very few white institutions in that day preserved black history. Historically, black colleges had been where such artifacts were placed. Despite evidence McDaniel had earned an excellent income as an actress, her final estate was less than $10,000. The IRS claimed the estate owed more than $11,000 in taxes. In the end, the probate court ordered all of her property, including her Oscar, sold to pay off creditors. Years later, the Oscar turned up where McDaniel wanted it to be: Howard University, where, according to reports, it was displayed in <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> <b>case</b> in the university's drama department.|$|E
50|$|Site {{preparation}} {{started in}} June 2015, when {{the wall was}} razed between the Casino Building (Kazina) and the building at Congress Square no. 3. The display area was opened on June 23, 2015 with a temporary model of the monument enclosed in <b>a</b> <b>glass</b> display <b>case.</b> The permanent monument is scheduled for installation in 2016.|$|R
50|$|Closer to {{the house}} is a stable and {{carriage}} house. It, too, is similar to the main house, with a randomly laid stone foundation, shingled walls, towers and gabled dormers. Inside it has oak walls and <b>a</b> special <b>glass</b> <b>case</b> for the harnesses. It has been converted into a house. To the west, near the river, is a small open pagoda used for concerts in the summertime.|$|R
50|$|The altarpiece {{is located}} in the cathedral Santa Maria Assunta in the town of Cividale in Friuli. The {{rectangular}} relief plate which measures about one meter high and two meters wide is made of partly gilded silver. Protected by <b>a</b> modern <b>glass</b> <b>case,</b> it towers above the principal altar in the choir. It was consecrated by Pellegrino II who was patriarch of Aquileia between 1195 and 1204.|$|R
