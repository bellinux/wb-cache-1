5|$|The {{albatross}} diet {{is predominantly}} cephalopods, fish, crustaceans, and offal (organ meat), although {{they will also}} scavenge carrion and feed on other zooplankton. It {{should be noted that}} for most species a comprehensive understanding of diet is known for only the breeding season, when the albatrosses regularly return to land and study is possible. The importance of each of these food sources varies from species to species, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>from</b> population to population; some concentrate on squid alone, others take more krill or fish. Of the two albatross species found in Hawaii, one, the black-footed albatross, takes mostly fish while the Laysan feeds on squid.|$|E

5|$|Under German occupation, {{the professions}} of Polish journalists and writers were {{virtually}} eliminated, {{as they had}} little opportunity to publish their work. The Underground State's Department of Culture sponsored various initiatives and individuals, enabling them to continue their work and aiding in their publication. Novels and anthologies were published by underground presses; over 1,000 workswere published underground {{over the course of}} the war. Literary discussions were held, and prominent writers of the period working in Poland included, among others, Krzysztof Kamil Baczyński, Leslaw Bartelski, Tadeusz Borowski, Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński, Maria Dąbrowska, Tadeusz Gajcy, Zuzanna Ginczanka, Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz, future Nobel Prize winner Czesław Miłosz, Zofia Nałkowska, Jan Parandowski, Leopold Staff, Kazimierz Wyka, and Jerzy Zawieyski. Writers wrote about the difficult conditions in the prisoner-of-war camps (Konstanty Ildefons Gałczyński, Stefan Flukowski, Leon Kruczkowski, Andrzej Nowicki and Marian Piechała), the ghettos, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>from</b> inside the concentration camps (Jan Maria Gisges, Halina Gołczowa, Zofia Górska (Romanowiczowa), Tadeusz Hołuj, Kazimierz Andrzej Jaworski and Marian Kubicki). Many writers did not survive the war, among them Krzysztof Kamil Baczyński, Wacław Berent, Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński, Tadeusz Gajcy, Zuzanna Ginczanka, Juliusz Kaden-Bandrowski, Stefan Kiedrzyński, Janusz Korczak, Halina Krahelska, Tadeusz Hollender, Witold Hulewicz, Ferdynand Antoni Ossendowski, Włodzimierz Pietrzak, Leon Pomirowski, Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer and Bruno Schulz.|$|E

25|$|Lawrence's Natural {{history of}} man {{contained}} some remarkable anticipations of later thought, but was ruthlessly suppressed.

25|$|The Lunfardo argot {{originated}} {{within the}} prison population, {{and in time}} spread to all porteños. Lunfardo uses words from Italian dialects, from Brazilian Portuguese, from African and Caribbean languages <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>from</b> English. Lunfardo employs humorous tricks such as inverting the syllables within a word (vesre). Today, Lunfardo is mostly heard in tango lyrics; the slang of the younger generations has been evolving away from it.|$|E

25|$|The Walsh bill won almost {{unanimous}} {{support from}} the president, the cabinet, the Senate <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>from</b> Wagner himself. Wagner was unhappy {{with the number of}} provisions which had been watered down, but believed that passage of some legislation was preferable to inaction. He also resolved to draft much stronger legislation after the fall elections. Nevertheless, the Walsh bill faced an uncertain future in the Senate. Congress needed to adjourn and return home to campaign for the fall elections, and the bill promised a lengthy fight.|$|E
25|$|Sungai Ujong, a state {{within the}} {{confederation}} {{in particular was}} the site of many locally important mines. It was ruled by Dato' Kelana Sendeng. However, another local chieftain named Dato' Bandar Kulop Tunggal had more influence than Dato' Kelana. Dato' Bandar received great support from the locals <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>from</b> the Chinese immigrants who worked at the mines of Sungai Ujong. Dato' Kelana's limited popularity made him dependent on another chieftain named Sayid Abdul Rahman, who was the confederation's Laksamana Raja Laut (roughly royal sea admiral). The strained relationship between Dato' Bandar and Dato' Kelana caused frequent disturbances in Sungai Ujong.|$|E

25|$|Before the 1890s, many {{hard rock}} mines were {{owned by the}} miners who had {{discovered}} them. Owners who had been miners were often more sympathetic {{to the concerns of}} miners. But the higher cost of industrialization changed that. The typical mine owners of the 1890s started out as bankers, managers, and businessmen who had never entered a mine, and whose primary concern was profitability. Lode mining took capital, and investors from the east and west coasts, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>from</b> Europe, were actively courted. When the Colorado Legislature passed a law in 1887 prohibiting foreign ownership of real estate in Colorado, mine ownership was excepted.|$|E
25|$|In 1919 {{it became}} obvious that Bertrand would refuse to allow an open {{election}} to choose his successor. Such a course of action was opposed by the United States and had little popular support in Honduras. The local military commander and governor of Tegucigalpa, General Rafael López Gutiérrez, took the lead in organizing PLH opposition to Bertrand. López Gutiérrez also solicited support from the liberal government of Guatemala <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>from</b> the conservative regime in Nicaragua. Bertrand, in turn, sought support from El Salvador. Determined to avoid an international conflict, the United States, after some hesitation, offered to meditate the dispute, hinting to the Honduran president that if he refused the offer, open intervention might follow.|$|E
25|$|In October 2009, {{the bridge}} option again {{surfaced}} in the public eye, {{with a group of}} backers again suggesting that a bridge would be a better option from an urban design, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>from</b> a transport point of view. Critics noted that the proposal would delay other transport plans in the region due to the funding required for it, especially for a 2015 target. The then mayor of North Shore City, Andrew Williams, and the then Chairman of the Auckland Regional Council, Mike Lee, both opposed the reconsideration of existing decisions that had been in favour of a tunnel. The then mayor of Auckland City, John Banks, also favoured the tunnel option, though he did not outright oppose the bridge idea, while the then mayor of Manukau City, Len Brown, considered the bridge proposal worthy of consideration.|$|E
