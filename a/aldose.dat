5|$|Grown {{in liquid}} culture, Crucibulum laeve {{produces}} bioactive chemicals called salfredins that are structurally related to benzofuran and chromene, molecules that contain cyclic amide or lactone five-membered ring structures; these compounds {{are unique to}} this species. Salfredin B11 was first identified in 1995, while later research confirmed the presence of additional salfredin-type metabolites. These compounds are inhibitors of <b>aldose</b> reductase, an enzyme that has been implicated {{in the formation of}} cataracts in advanced stages of diabetes mellitus. The salfredin compounds may have therapeutic use in the treatment of this disorder.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{similarity}} in how proteins bind the two coenzymes, enzymes almost always show {{a high level}} of specificity for either NAD or NADP. This specificity reflects the distinct metabolic roles of the respective coenzymes, and is the result of distinct sets of amino acid residues in the two types of coenzyme-binding pocket. For instance, in the active site of NADP-dependent enzymes, an ionic bond is formed between a basic amino acid side-chain and the acidic phosphate group of NADP. On the converse, in NAD-dependent enzymes the charge in this pocket is reversed, preventing NADP from binding. However, there are a few exceptions to this general rule, and enzymes such as <b>aldose</b> reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase can use both coenzymes in some species.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aldose</b> reductase is {{the first}} enzyme in the sorbitol-aldose reductase pathway {{responsible}} for the reduction of glucose to sorbitol, {{as well as the}} reduction of galactose to galactitol. Too much sorbitol trapped in retinal cells, the cells of the lens, and the Schwann cells that myelinate peripheral nerves, is a frequent result of long-term hyperglycemia that accompanies poorly controlled diabetes. This can damage these cells, leading to retinopathy, cataracts and peripheral neuropathy, respectively. <b>Aldose</b> reductase inhibitors, which are substances that prevent or slow the action of <b>aldose</b> reductase, are currently being investigated as a way to prevent or delay these complications.|$|E
40|$|The {{accumulation}} {{and degradation}} of carbohydrates (<b>aldoses)</b> were investigated during diatom blooms in two mesocosms. The effects of macrozooplankton were explored by addition of zooplankton to one mesocosm (+Z). <b>Aldoses</b> accumulated {{at a steady}} rate of 4. 9 μM C d- 1 from day 9 in the mesocosm without zooplankton (-Z), while zooplankton induced an increased rate to 10. 3 μM C d- 1. The surplus of 14 μM dissolved combined carbohydrates (DCCHO) in the +Z mesocosm after 22 days was caused by higher concentrations of arabinose, galactose and rhamnose. The increase was 50, 25 and 25 % respectively in the +Z mesocosm, compared with the -Z mesocosm. The introduction of zooplankton {{had a significant effect}} on the rate of biodegradation and the fraction of refractory <b>aldoses.</b> The accumulated <b>aldoses</b> became less labile and a larger fraction was refractory with the presence of zooplankton. During degradation the fraction of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) explained by <b>aldoses</b> decreased in the –Z mesocosm while it increased with the presence of grazers. In the +Z mesocosm, two new peaks appeared on the chromatograms and contributed about 4 % to the total area of <b>aldoses.</b> It is hypothesised that these two peaks are an indicator of the presence of grazers...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} the separations of all aldopentoses (ribose, arabinose, xylose and lyxose) and aldohexoses (glucose, galactose, allose, altrose, mannose, gulose, idose and talose) on the D 6 stationary phase {{prepared by the}} reaction of chloromethylated styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer and N,N,N’,N’-tetramethyl- 1, 6 -diaminohexane, we examined the effect of varying the concentration of the NaOH eluent on the elution orders. Separations of these <b>aldoses</b> were achieved using a 20 mM NaOH eluent. The elution behaviors of the <b>aldoses</b> were probably due to not only the individual pKa values, but also the chemical structures of the cyclic <b>aldoses...</b>|$|R
40|$|A new {{isomerization}} {{reaction was}} developed to synthesize rare ketoses. d-Tagatose, d-xylulose, and d-ribulose were obtained in the maximum yields of 24 %, 38 %, and 40 %, respectively, from the corresponding <b>aldoses,</b> d-galactose, d-xylose, and d-ribose, by treating the <b>aldoses</b> with 80 % (v/v) subcritical aqueous ethanol at 180 °C. The maximum productivity of d-tagatose was ca. 80 g/(Lh). Increasing the concentration of ethanol significantly increased the isomerization of d-galactose. Variation in the reaction temperature did not significantly affect the production of d-tagatose from d-galactose. Subcritical aqueous ethanol converted both 2, 3 -threo and 2, 3 -erythro <b>aldoses</b> to the corresponding C- 2 ketoses in high yields. Thus, the treatment of common <b>aldoses</b> in subcritical aqueous ethanol {{can be regarded as}} a new method to synthesize the corresponding rare sugars...|$|R
25|$|Transketolase is {{an enzyme}} {{of both the}} pentose {{phosphate}} pathway in all organisms and the Calvin cycle of photosynthesis. It catalyzes two important reactions, which operate in opposite directions in these two pathways. In the first reaction of the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, the cofactor thiamine diphosphate accepts a 2-carbon fragment from a 5-carbon ketose (D-xylulose-5-P), then transfers this fragment to a 5-carbon <b>aldose</b> (D-ribose-5-P) to form a 7-carbon ketose (sedoheptulose-7-P). The abstraction of two carbons from D-xylulose-5-P yields the 3-carbon <b>aldose</b> glyceraldehyde-3-P. In the Calvin cycle, transketolase catalyzes the reverse reaction, the conversion of sedoheptulose-7-P and glyceraldehyde-3-P to pentoses, the <b>aldose</b> D-ribose-5-P and the ketose D-xylulose-5-P.|$|E
25|$|Sorbitol may be {{synthesised}} via a glucose reduction {{reaction in}} which the aldehyde group is converted into a hydroxyl group. The reaction requires NADH and is catalyzed by <b>aldose</b> reductase. Glucose reduction {{is the first step}} of the polyol pathway of glucose metabolism, and is implicated in multiple diabetic complications.|$|E
25|$|Destabilizing the {{molecule}} {{in the previous}} reaction allows the hexose ring to be split by aldolase into two triose sugars: dihydroxyacetone phosphate (a ketose), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (an <b>aldose).</b> There are two classes of aldolases: class I aldolases, present in animals and plants, and class II aldolases, present in fungi and bacteria; the two classes use different mechanisms in cleaving the ketose ring.|$|E
50|$|<b>Aldoses</b> are {{commonly}} referred to by names specific to one stereoisomer of the compound. This distinction is especially vital in Biochemistry, as many systems can only use one enantiomer of the carbohydrate and not the other. However, <b>aldoses</b> {{are by no means}} locked into any one conformation forever, they can and do fluctuate between a couple of different forms.|$|R
50|$|<b>Aldoses</b> can {{be further}} {{differentiated}} according {{to the number of}} carbon atoms they contain in the main chain using Greek roots (tri-, tet-, pent-, hex-, etc.), the common formula is to place the number signifier after aldo (or keto if it is a ketose), as in aldotriose. The following is a list of other common <b>aldoses.</b>|$|R
40|$|One-pot {{reactions}} of <b>aldoses</b> with L-cysteine methyl ester and o-tolyl isothiocyanate yielded methyl 2 -(polyhydroxyalkyl) - 3 -(o-tolylthiocarbamoyl) -thiazolidine- 4 (R) -carboxylates. Direct HPLC {{analysis of the}} reaction mixture and UV detection at 250 nm discriminated D- and L-enantiomers of <b>aldoses.</b> The reaction {{was applied to the}} determination of absolute configuration the sugar residues of an aroma precursor...|$|R
25|$|The second {{reaction}} catalyzed by transketolase in the pentose phosphate pathway {{involves the}} same thiamine diphosphate-mediated transfer of a 2-carbon fragment from D-xylulose-5-P to the <b>aldose</b> erythrose-4-phosphate, affording fructose 6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-P. Again, in the Calvin cycle {{exactly the same}} reaction occurs, but in the opposite direction. Moreover, in the Calvin cycle {{this is the first}} reaction catalyzed by transketolase, rather than the second.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} {{has been involved}} in many scientific breakthroughs and inventions. From 1925 until 1948, Sir Norman Haworth was Professor and Director of the Department of Chemistry. He was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Science and acted as Vice-Principal from 1947 until 1948. His research focused predominantly on carbohydrate chemistry in which he confirmed a number of structures of optically active sugars. By 1928, he had deduced and confirmed the structures of maltose, cellobiose, lactose, gentiobiose, melibiose, gentianose, raffinose, as well as the glucoside ring tautomeric structure of <b>aldose</b> sugars. His research helped to define the basic features of the starch, cellulose, glycogen, inulin and xylan molecules. He also contributed towards solving the problems with bacterial polysaccharides. He was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1937.|$|E
25|$|Sugar can be {{characterized}} by having reducing or non-reducing ends. A reducing end of a carbohydrate is a carbon atom that can be in equilibrium with the open-chain aldehyde (<b>aldose)</b> or keto form (ketose). If the joining of monomers takes place at such a carbon atom, the free hydroxy group of the pyranose or furanose form is exchanged with an OH-side-chain of another sugar, yielding a full acetal. This prevents opening of the chain to the aldehyde or keto form and renders the modified residue non-reducing. Lactose contains a reducing end at its glucose moiety, whereas the galactose moiety forms a full acetal with the C4-OH group of glucose. Saccharose {{does not have a}} reducing end because of full acetal formation between the aldehyde carbon of glucose (C1) and the keto carbon of fructose (C2).|$|E
50|$|The {{aldehyde}} {{functional group}} allows the sugar {{to act as}} a reducing agent, for example in the Tollens' test or Benedict's test. The cyclic hemiacetal forms of <b>aldoses</b> can open to reveal an aldehyde and certain ketoses can undergo tautomerization to become <b>aldoses.</b> However, acetals, including those found in polysaccharide linkages, cannot easily become free aldehydes.|$|R
50|$|The process only {{provides}} {{direct access}} to <b>aldoses,</b> whereas some sugars of interest may instead be ketoses. Some ketoses may be accessible from similar <b>aldoses</b> by isomerization via an enediol intermediate; for example, on standing in aqueous base, glucose, fructose, and mannose will slowly interconvert since they share an enediol form. (See mutarotation). Some unusual sugars are also accessible via aldol addition.|$|R
50|$|Because {{they have}} at least one {{asymmetric}} carbon center, <b>aldoses</b> with three or more carbon atoms exhibit stereoisomerism. <b>Aldoses</b> containing stereogenic centers can exist in either a - form or - form. The determination is made based on the chirality of the penultimate carbon (the second-furthest from the aldehyde), where alcohol groups on the right of the Fischer projection result in -aldoses, and epimers with alcohols on the left result in -aldoses. Biological systems tend to recognize -aldoses more than -aldoses.|$|R
2500|$|Aldehydes {{are highly}} {{reactive}} {{and participate in}} many reactions. From the industrial perspective, important reactions are (a) condensations, e.g. to prepare plasticizers and polyols, and (b) reduction to produce alcohols, especially [...] "oxo-alcohols." [...] From the biological perspective, the key reactions involve addition of nucleophiles to the formyl carbon {{in the formation of}} imines (oxidative deamination) and hemiacetals (structures of <b>aldose</b> sugars).|$|E
2500|$|A {{monosaccharide}} {{can switch}} from the acyclic (open-chain) form to a cyclic form, through a nucleophilic addition reaction between the carbonyl group {{and one of}} the hydroxyls of the same molecule. [...] The reaction creates a ring of carbon atoms closed by one bridging oxygen atom. The resulting molecule has an hemiacetal or hemiketal group, depending on whether the linear form was an <b>aldose</b> or a ketose. [...] The reaction is easily reversed, yielding the original open-chain form.|$|E
2500|$|Many eukaryotes {{have the}} ability to {{synthesize}} carnitine, including humans. [...] Humans synthesize carnitine from the substrate TML (6-N-trimethyllysine), which is in turn derived from the methylation of the amino acid lysine. [...] TML is then hydroxylated into hydroxytrimethyllysine (HTML) by trimethyllysine dioxygenase, requiring the presence of ascorbic acid. [...] HTML is then cleaved by HTML <b>aldose,</b> yielding 4-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde (TMABA) and glycine. [...] TMABA is then dehydrogenated into gamma-butyrobetaine, in an NAD+-dependent reaction, catalyzed by TMABA dehydrogenase. [...] Gamma-butyrobetaine is then hydroxylated by gamma butyrobetaine hydroxylase into L-carnitine, requiring iron in the form of Fe2+.|$|E

5000|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of isomerases, {{specifically}} those intramolecular oxidoreductases interconverting <b>aldoses</b> and ketoses. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 11-deoxycorticosterone aldose-ketose-isomerase.|$|R
5000|$|A {{reducing}} sugar is any sugar that {{is capable of}} acting as a reducing agent because it has a free aldehyde group or a free ketone group. All monosaccharides are {{reducing sugar}}s, along with some disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides. The monosaccharides can be divided into two groups: the <b>aldoses,</b> which have an aldehyde group, and the ketoses, which have a ketone group. Ketoses must first tautomerize to <b>aldoses</b> before they can act as reducing sugars. The common dietary monosaccharides galactose, glucose and fructose are all reducing sugars.|$|R
2500|$|Although this enzyme {{is able to}} bind {{numerous}} {{types of}} substrates, such as phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated monosaccharides including the keto and aldosugars fructose, ribose, etc., it has a high specificity for the stereoconfiguration of the hydroxyl groups of the sugars. [...] These hydroxyl groups at C-3 and C-4 of the ketose donor {{must be in the}} D-threo configuration in order to correctly correspond to the C-1 and C-2 positions on the <b>aldose</b> acceptor. [...] Also they stabilize the substrate in the active site by interacting with the Asp477, His30, and His263 residues. [...] Disruption of this configuration, both the placement of hydroxyl groups or their stereochemistry, would consequently alter the H-bonding between the residues and substrates thus causing a lower affinity for the substrates.|$|E
2500|$|Each carbon atom {{bearing a}} {{hydroxyl}} group (-OH), {{with the exception}} of the first and last carbons, are asymmetric, making them stereo centers with two possible configurations each (R or S). Because of this asymmetry, a number of isomers may exist for any given monosaccharide formula. Using Le Bel-van't Hoff rule, the aldohexose D-glucose, for example, has the formula (C·H2O)6, of which four of its six carbons atoms are stereogenic, making D-glucose one of 24=16 possible stereoisomers. In the case of glyceraldehydes, an aldotriose, there is one pair of possible stereoisomers, which are enantiomers and epimers. 1, 3-dihydroxyacetone, the ketose corresponding to the <b>aldose</b> glyceraldehydes, is a symmetric molecule with no stereo centers. The assignment of D or L is made according to the orientation of the asymmetric carbon furthest from the carbonyl group: in a standard Fischer projection if the hydroxyl group is on the right the molecule is a D sugar, otherwise it is an L sugar. The [...] "D-" [...] and [...] "L-" [...] prefixes should not be confused with [...] "d-" [...] or [...] "l-", which indicate the direction that the sugar [...] rotates plane polarized light. This usage of [...] "d-" [...] and [...] "l-" [...] is no longer followed in carbohydrate chemistry.|$|E
50|$|Galactose mutarotase (<b>aldose</b> 1-epimerase) (gene name GALM) {{is a human}} {{enzyme that}} {{converts}} alpha-aldose to the beta-anomer. It belongs to family of <b>aldose</b> epimerases.|$|E
50|$|Aldaric acids {{are usually}} {{synthesized}} by the oxidation of <b>aldoses</b> with nitric acid. In this reaction {{it is the}} open-chain (polyhydroxyaldehyde) form of the sugar that reacts.|$|R
50|$|A {{sugar is}} {{classified}} as a reducing sugar only if it has an open-chain form with an aldehyde group or a free hemiacetal group. Monosaccharides which contain an aldehyde group are known as <b>aldoses,</b> and those with a ketone group are known as ketoses. The aldehyde can be oxidized via a redox reaction in which another compound is reduced. Thus, a reducing sugar is one that reduces certain chemicals. Sugars with ketone groups in their open chain form are capable of isomerizing via a series of tautomeric shifts to produce an aldehyde group in solution. Therefore, ketone-bearing sugars like fructose are considered reducing sugars {{but it is the}} isomer containing an aldehyde group which is reducing since ketones cannot be oxidized without decomposition of the sugar. This type of isomerization is catalyzed by the base present in solutions which test for the presence of aldehydes. <b>Aldoses</b> or aldehyde-bearing sugars are reducing also because during oxidation of <b>aldoses,</b> there are certain oxidizing agents that are reduced.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{experimental}} studies of the processing of organic matter in marine sediments by benthic fauna have used isotopically labelled organic substrates as tracers for natural organic matter and have followed processes such as ingestion, bioturbation, remineralisation and burial. In order to use these labelling techniques to trace organic matter on a detailed level {{through the process of}} digestion and assimilation, it is necessary to be able to detect isotopically labelled biochemicals and to distinguish them from their natural, unlabelled counterparts. In this study existing methods for the GC analysis of amino acids and <b>aldoses</b> are combined with the Sun-type isotope calibration technique for GC-MS (Sun M. Y., 2000, Org. Geochem. 31, 199 - 209) to achieve quantitative measurement of 13 C labelled amino acids and <b>aldoses</b> in fauna and sediment samples from a feeding experiment. In order to demonstrate the methods, example data from feeding experiments are presented, which suggest that assimilation of amino acids and <b>aldoses</b> by polychaetes during digestion is selective and taxon specific. ...|$|R

50|$|An <b>aldose</b> {{contains}} only one aldehyde (−CH=O) group per molecule, whereas a ketose contains a ketone group. The chemical formula {{takes the form}} Cn(H2O)n. The simplest possible <b>aldose</b> is the diose glycolaldehyde, which only contains two carbon atoms.|$|E
50|$|Direct {{oxidation}} of an <b>aldose</b> {{affects the}} aldehyde group first. A laboratory synthesis of a uronic acid from an <b>aldose</b> requires protecting the aldehyde and hydroxy groups from oxidation, for example by conversion to cyclic acetals (e. g., acetonides).|$|E

50|$|<b>Aldoses</b> can tautomerize to ketoses in {{a dynamic}} process with an enol intermediate. This process is {{reversible}} and when discussing a mass group of sugars, <b>aldoses</b> and ketoses are {{thought of as}} being in equilibrium with each other due to the low energy barrier of the transition. However aldehydes and ketones are almost always more stable than their enol forms, so the aldo- and keto- forms are assumed to predominate at any given moment. This process, with its enol intermediate, when applied occurring at other carbons on the chain allows stereoisomerization. Basic solutions exacerbate the interconversion of isomers.|$|R
