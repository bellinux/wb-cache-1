5000|$|In photography, {{the term}} [...] "acutance" [...] {{describes}} a subjective perception of sharpness that {{is related to}} the edge contrast of an image. <b>Acutance</b> {{is related to the}} amplitude of the derivative of brightness with respect to space. Due {{to the nature of the}} human visual system, an image with higher <b>acutance</b> appears sharper even though an increase in <b>acutance</b> does not increase real resolution.|$|E
5000|$|One {{definition}} of <b>acutance</b> {{is determined by}} imaging a sharp [...] "knife-edge", producing an S-shaped distribution over a width W between maximum density D1 and minimum density D2 - steeper transitions yield higher <b>acutance.</b>|$|E
50|$|Low-pass {{filtering}} and resampling often cause overshoot, {{which increases}} <b>acutance,</b> {{but can also}} reduce absolute gradient, which reduces <b>acutance.</b> Filtering and resampling can also cause clipping and ringing artifacts. An example is bicubic interpolation, widely used in image processing for resizing images.|$|E
50|$|Thus the <b>acutance</b> of {{an image}} is a vector field.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Artificially added {{overshoot}} {{around the}} left bar increases <b>acutance.</b>|$|E
50|$|Several image {{processing}} techniques, such as unsharp masking, {{can increase the}} <b>acutance</b> in real images.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The same image, {{with added}} global {{contrast}}, and local contrast (<b>acutance)</b> increased through unsharp masking.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, <b>acutance</b> was {{enhanced}} chemically during {{development of}} a negative (High <b>Acutance</b> Developers), or by optical means in printing (Unsharp Masking). In digital photography, onboard camera software and image postprocessing tools such as Photoshop or GIMP offer various sharpening facilities, {{the most widely used}} of which is known as [...] "unsharp mask" [...] because the algorithm is derived from the eponymous analog processing method.|$|E
5000|$|Summing {{the slope}} Gn {{of the curve}} at N points within W gives the <b>acutance</b> value A, ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Unsharp masking {{has been}} applied to lower part of image, {{creating}} overshoot and undershoot and increasing <b>acutance.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Another illustration, where {{overshoot}} {{caused by}} using unsharp masking to sharpen the image (bottom half) increases <b>acutance.</b>|$|E
50|$|Overshoot {{is often}} undesirable, {{particularly}} if it causes clipping, but is sometimes desirable in image sharpening, due to increasing <b>acutance</b> (perceived sharpness).|$|E
50|$|Coarse grain or noise can, like {{sharpening}} filters, increase <b>acutance,</b> hence {{increasing the}} perception of sharpness, even though they degrade the signal-to-noise ratio.|$|E
50|$|The {{technique}} {{was first used}} in Germany during the 1930s {{as a way of}} increasing the <b>acutance,</b> or apparent resolution, of photographic images.|$|E
5000|$|More generally, the <b>acutance</b> at a {{point in}} an image is the {{gradient}} of the density (or intensity) at that point, a vector quantity: ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the example}} image, two light gray lines were drawn on a gray background. As the {{transition}} is instantaneous, the line is as sharp as can be represented at this resolution. <b>Acutance</b> in the left line was artificially increased by adding a one-pixel-wide darker border {{on the outside of}} the line and a one-pixel-wide brighter border on the inside of the line. The actual sharpness of the image is unchanged, but the apparent sharpness is increased because of the greater <b>acutance.</b>|$|E
50|$|Edge {{enhancement}} is {{an image}} processing filter that enhances the edge contrast of an image or video {{in an attempt to}} improve its <b>acutance</b> (apparent sharpness).|$|E
50|$|While ringing {{artifacts}} {{are generally}} considered undesirable, the initial overshoot (haloing) at transitions increases <b>acutance</b> (apparent sharpness) {{by increasing the}} derivative across the transition, and thus {{can be considered as}} an enhancement.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{lower half}} of this figure is a {{magnification}} of the upper half, showing how the apparent sharpness of the left-hand line is created. Bicubic interpolation causes overshoot, which increases <b>acutance.</b>|$|E
50|$|Perceived {{sharpness}} is {{a combination}} of both resolution and acutance: it is thus a combination of the captured resolution, which cannot be changed in processing, and of <b>acutance,</b> which can be so changed.|$|E
50|$|However, {{due to the}} {{negative}} lobes on the kernel, it causes overshoot (haloing). This can cause clipping, and is an artifact (see also ringing artifacts), but it increases <b>acutance</b> (apparent sharpness), and can be desirable.|$|E
50|$|Artificially {{increased}} <b>acutance</b> has drawbacks. In this somewhat overdone example most {{viewers will}} {{also be able to}} see the borders separately from the line, which create two halos around the line, one dark and one shimmering bright.|$|E
50|$|High {{levels of}} noise {{are almost always}} undesirable, but there are cases when {{a certain amount of}} noise is useful, for example to prevent {{discretization}} artifacts (color banding or posterization). Some noise also increases <b>acutance</b> (apparent sharpness). Noise purposely added for such purposes is called dither; it improves the image perceptually, though it degrades the signal-to-noise ratio.|$|E
5000|$|A {{well-known}} {{property of}} Rodinal is its high <b>acutance,</b> because the Rodinal formula contains no silver solvent. Consequently the metallic silver in film, once developed, {{is left in}} its natural state, and does not undergo any [...] "softening" [...] {{by means of a}} solvent. It is not uncommon for photographers to add a solvent (such as sodium sulfite) to soften the granularity.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{positive}} has been blurred intentionally, only the low frequency (blurred) information is cancelled. In addition, the mask effectively reduces the dynamic {{range of the}} original negative. Thus, if the resulting enlarged image is recorded on contrasty photographic paper, the partial cancellation emphasizes the high spatial frequency (fine detail) information in the original, without loss of highlight or shadow detail. The resulting print appears more acute than one made without the unsharp mask: its <b>acutance</b> is increased.|$|E
50|$|A {{derivative}} of contrast masking is unsharp masking, an unusual {{term for a}} process intended to increase the apparent sharpness (<b>acutance)</b> of an image. Unsharp masking uses a blurred form of the image to increase contrast along regions of moderate contrast difference. Around edges, the blur region causes highlights to overexpose and shadows to underexpose. Taken to an extreme, the edges become overly visible and detract from {{the quality of the}} image—this is referred to as halation.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} forms of image sharpening, edge {{enhancement}} is only capable of improving the perceived sharpness or <b>acutance</b> of an image. The enhancement is not completely reversible, and as such some detail in the image is lost {{as a result of}} filtering. Further sharpening operations on the resulting image compound the loss of detail, leading to artifacts such as ringing. An example of this can be seen when an image that has already had edge enhancement applied, such as the picture on a DVD video, has further edge enhancement applied by the DVD player it is played on, and possibly also by the television it is displayed on. Essentially, the first edge enhancement filter creates new edges {{on either side of the}} existing edges, which are then further enhanced.|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} was devised to quantitatively measure {{the effect of}} blue base tint (inherent in most medical x ray films) on the sensitivity and <b>acutance</b> of an x ray film. Results showed no significant difference due to the blue base tint for sensitivity. However, a {{significant difference was found}} for the base tint 2 ̆ 7 s effect on <b>acutance</b> of an x ray film. It was determined that the difference in <b>acutance</b> was due to an 2 ̆ 2 anti–halation effect 2 ̆ 2 of the blue base dye...|$|E
40|$|The Mach Phenomenon*(as {{perceived}} on photographic film) is herein investigated as {{a function}} of edge <b>acutance,</b> contrast and illumination level for the purpose of determining its probable effect in the area of visual image evaluation. The results indicate that dark Mach band widths increase as <b>acutance</b> decreases and dark band width is independent of contrast and illumination level while light band widths remain constant, over the ranges investigated. Using these findings as a basis, a dark band width predictor equation was found, taking the form; dark band width (in microns) =K/acutance, when average edge gradient is the measure of <b>acutance.</b> The probable effects (which increase in importance as <b>acutance</b> decreases) of the Mach bands on visual image evaluation is then discussed. * a visual sensation of density bands near edge...|$|E
40|$|In a {{complete}} imaging system, {{consisting of a}} camera and a camera lens, four black and white films, an enlarger, a print made from each film {{and a number of}} observers, the resultant images were judged subjectively. The system was also evaluated by four <b>acutance</b> models. When the <b>acutance</b> ratings were compared with the sharpness ratings there was not a significant correlation between the two ratings. The author believes {{that there would be a}} better correlation between the two ratings if the <b>acutance</b> models were used under the same conditiobs and the same constants as they were formulated under...|$|E

40|$|Sludge is {{considered}} by many to be a factor limiting the usefulness of monobaths. A particular film-monobath combination was tested for the effects of sludge on sensitometry, granularity, and <b>acutance.</b> It was found that the presence of sludge did not alter the sensitometric characteristics; however, through solution usage, the <b>acutance</b> and granularity decreased.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{automatic}} focusing of a visual inspection system is described. A vidicon camera was mounted {{on top of}} a high powered microscope to capture an image, process it and send an appropriate signal to a stepper motor which controls the movements of the microscope. The method used is based on the <b>acutance</b> of the video signal wave form. <b>Acutance</b> {{is a measure of the}} steepness of the video signal waveform. It implies that a sharp image will have a sharp gradient of the gray level across the image. This is measured vertically and horizontally and used to control the movements of a stepper motor t...|$|E
40|$|Background/aims: The {{interpretation}} {{of high contrast}} retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) images in glaucoma can be confounded {{by the presence of}} image blur; {{it can be difficult to}} discern diffuse axon loss in a poor quality image. One solution is to provide an objective measure of the image quality based on features in the image other than the RNFL. In this study the authors have developed an objective method to quantify the clarity of RNFL images, comparing it with a subjective image grading system. Methods: Digitally acquired, monochrome retinal images were taken from 58 eyes (one image per eye) with a Topcon 50 IX retinal camera. Image resolution was 1320 ´ 1032 pixels at 8 bits per pixel. Image sharpness was subjectively graded by two masked experienced observers on a scale 1 to 5 relative to a reference set of RNFL images. Software algorithms were developed using Matlab (5. 2) to calculate the <b>acutance,</b> an objective measure of the physical characteristics that underlie the subjective impression of sharpness in an image. Results: <b>Acutance</b> values could be calculated for all the images. The Pearson correlation coefficients of the log of the <b>acutance</b> for each image and the subjective grades of observer 1 and observer 2 were 0. 90 (p< 0. 001, n= 58) and 0. 84 (p< 0. 001, n= 58) respectively. Conclusions: These data suggest that <b>acutance</b> may provide a useful objective measure of image quality, which correlates well with the subjective impression of the digital retinal image sharpness. Objective measures of image quality should help in the discrimination of diffuse retinal nerve fibre loss from image blur in patients with diffuse glaucomatous damage...|$|E
40|$|The {{capture and}} {{retention}} of image detail are important characteristics for system design and subsystem selection. An established imaging performance measure that is well suited to certain sources of detail loss, such as optical focus and motion blur, is the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF). Recently {{we have seen the}} development of image quality methods aimed at more adaptive operations, such as noise cleaning and adaptive digital filtering. An example of this is the measure of texture (image detail) loss using sets of overlapping small objects, known as dead leaves targets. In this paper we investigate the application of the above method to image compression. We apply several levels of JPEG and JPEG 2000 compression to digital images that include scene content that is amenable to the texture loss measure. A modified form of the method was used. This allowed direct target compensation without data smoothing. Following a camera simulation, the texture MTF and <b>acutance</b> were computed. The standard deviation of the <b>acutance</b> measure was 0. 014 (relative error of 1. 63 %), found by replicate measurements. Structured similarity index (SSIM) values, used for still and video image quality evaluation, were also computed for the image sets. The <b>acutance</b> and SSI results were similar; however {{the relationship between the two}} showed an offset between the JPEG and JPEG 2000 image sets...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{criterion}} of the fingerprint image quality. To establish the criterion {{is very important for}} developing the more excellent image enhance technique. As the criterion we suggest two methods. One is a modified <b>acutance</b> method and the other is based on the conception of autocorrelation. From experimental results, it can be shown that both methods are basically available for estimation of the fingerprint image quality...|$|E
