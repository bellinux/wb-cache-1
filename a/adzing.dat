25|$|Carpenter's adze - A heavy adze, {{often with}} very steep curves, {{and a very}} heavy, blunt pole. The weight of this adze makes it {{unsuitable}} for sustained overhead <b>adzing.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Adze-end variations: As with non-ice-tool <b>adzes,</b> {{those of}} ice tools vary in several aspects; other ice tools have a hammer head {{in place of}} the <b>adze,</b> or are modular, {{permitting}} switching styles of <b>adze</b> or hammer, and/or between <b>adze</b> and hammer.|$|R
50|$|The most {{universal}} <b>adze</b> was {{the elbow}} <b>adze,</b> {{named for its}} shape. Metal blades have been found on <b>adzes</b> for several hundred years, and currently very little evidence of stone blades usage exists. Elbow <b>adzes</b> were used for chopping and rough shaping, and were typically used on large works. D <b>adzes</b> were also used from Vancouver island southward. Their name comes from the shape of their haft, which were often carved to represent animals. The D <b>adze</b> was used for finer work and for finishing.|$|R
40|$|We report our {{attempts}} to experimentally replicate 25 fine-grained basalt Hawaiian quadrangular <b>adzes</b> using freehand percussion. We document the techniques, stages and distinctive debitage resulting from {{each stage of}} the reduction process. While the later experimental <b>adzes</b> in our series reproduced the Hawaiian quadrangular <b>adze</b> with accuracy, {{we were unable to}} achieve the level of finesse seen in some finished archaeological specimens. Our experiments, and the gap between our own results and the finest examples seen in some archaeological collections, indicates the very high levels of skill needed to make the most refined Hawaiian <b>adzes,</b> and supports the notion that some <b>adze</b> makers were undoubtedly specialists. Our experimental work complements another study of archaeological <b>adzes</b> that examines the technological strategies and the cumulative addition of morphological elements to <b>adzes</b> during manufacture. We hope this study will serve as a useful benchmark for objectively and systematically comparing quadrangular <b>adze</b> technology across Hawai‘i and throughout Polynesia, leading {{to a better understanding of}} regional and temporal variation in <b>adze</b> technology...|$|R
40|$|Hawaiian <b>adze</b> {{manufacture}} {{requires a}} great deal of skill and undoubtedly required long apprenticeships to achieve the finesse seen in many finished prehistoric <b>adzes.</b> Despite the presence of more than two dozen <b>adze</b> quarries in Hawai 2 ̆ 7 i, and previous attempts at replicating <b>adze</b> preforms and positing reduction sequences in Polynesia, there is no detailed study that clearly defines the steps and stages of quadrangular <b>adze</b> preform manufacture (the most common form in Hawai 2 ̆ 7 i), and the resulting characteristic debitage. In this paper we examine the sequence of <b>adze</b> production for a population of 109 <b>adzes</b> from Moloka 2 ̆ 7 i, documenting the transition from blanks to preforms to the finished objects that were transported away from quarries. Reduction intensity is measured using the Scar Density Index (Clarkson, 2013) calculated from 3 D scans. We document the sequence of cumulative additions of characteristic features to <b>adzes</b> (e. g. bidirectional edges, bevel, poll and tang) as reduction intensity increases. We also note the reasons for <b>adze</b> rejection at each stage of reduction. Our study provides the first detailed analysis of <b>adze</b> reduction in Polynesia facilitated and standardised by 3 D scanning technology. Hopefully, it will serve as a useful benchmark for objectively and systematically comparing <b>adze</b> technology in other parts of Hawai 2 ̆ 7 i and across Polynesia, leading {{to a better understanding of}} regional and temporal variation in <b>adze</b> technology...|$|R
25|$|Shipwright's <b>adze</b> - A lighter, {{and more}} {{versatile}} <b>adze</b> than the carpenter's <b>adze.</b> This {{was designed to}} be used in a variety of positions, including overhead, as well as in front on waist and chest level.|$|R
25|$|Lipped shipwright's <b>adze</b> - A {{variation}} of the shipwright's <b>adze.</b> It features a wider than normal bit, whose outside edges are sharply turned up, so that when gazing directly down the <b>adze,</b> from bit to eye, the cutting edge resembles an extremely wide and often very flat U. This <b>adze</b> was mainly used for shaping cross grain, such as for joining planks.|$|R
50|$|When width exceeds {{thickness}} {{they were}} named flat <b>adzes</b> (Flachhacke), when thickness exceeds width shoe-last <b>adzes</b> (Schuhleistenkeile), or high <b>adzes.</b> Within {{the latter group}} a distinction is sometimes made between intermediate Flomborn <b>adzes</b> and the higher Hinkelstein <b>adzes</b> (Buttler 1938; Bakels 1987; Merkel 1999). Later, subdivisions were {{made on the basis}} of metric characteristics into two groups (Schietzel 1965), six groups (Modderman 1970, 184) and finally two groups again (Dohrn-Ihmig 1983). All typologies were based on the width-height ratio, while Modderman added the absolute dimension. The wide variation, from small to large and from flat to high <b>adzes,</b> certainly reflects a functional differentiation, but the various types do not appear to be of chronological significance.|$|R
50|$|American Northwest coast {{native peoples}} {{traditionally}} used <b>adzes</b> for both functional construction (from bowls to canoes) and art (from masks to totem poles). Northwest coast <b>adzes</b> take two forms: hafted and D-handle. The hafted form {{is similar in}} form to a European <b>adze</b> with the haft constructed from a natural crooked branch which approximately forms a 60% angle. The thin end is used as the handle and the thick end is flattened and notched such that an <b>adze</b> iron can be lashed to it. Modern hafts are sometimes constructed from a sawed blank with a dowel added for strength at the crook. The second form is the D-handle <b>adze</b> which is basically an <b>adze</b> iron with a directly attached handle. The D-handle therefore provides no mechanical leverage. Northwest coast <b>adzes</b> are often classified by size and iron shape vs. role. As with European <b>adzes,</b> iron shapes include straight, gutter and lipped. Where larger Northwest <b>adzes</b> are similar in size to their European counterparts, the smaller sizes are typically much lighter such {{that they can be}} used for the detailed smoothing, shaping and surface texturing required for figure carving. Final surfacing is sometimes performed with a crooked knife.|$|R

25|$|Foot <b>adzes</b> {{are most}} {{commonly}} known as shipbuilder's or carpenter's <b>adzes.</b> They {{range in size from}} 00 to 5 being 3 1/4 to 4 3/4 pounds with the cutting edge 3 inches to 4 1/2 inches wide. On the modern, steel <b>adze</b> the cutting edge may be flat for smoothing work to very rounded for hollowing work such as bowls, gutters and canoes. The shoulders or sides of an <b>adze</b> may be curved called a lipped <b>adze,</b> used for notching. The end away from the cutting edge is called the pole and be of different shapes, generally flat or a pin pole.|$|R

25|$|The <b>adze</b> is {{depicted}} in ancient Egyptian art from the Old Kingdom onward. Originally the <b>adze</b> blades were made of stone, but already in the Predynastic Period copper <b>adzes</b> had all but replaced those made of flint. While stone blades were fastened to the wooden handle by tying, metal blades had sockets into which the handle was fitted. Examples of Egyptian <b>adzes</b> {{can be found in}} museums and on the Petrie Museum website.|$|R

40|$|This study uses XRF (X-ray fluorescence) and ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) {{analyses}} {{to determine the}} chemical composition of raw material used in stone tool production. The goal is to identify where stone <b>adzes,</b> which are common in Neolithic sites {{on the coast of}} Mainland China, were produced and if they were transported from the production areas to other places. Our study focuses on <b>adzes</b> from three Neolithic sites located on the Fujian coast of Mainland China, opposite Taiwan. The sites date to between 6500 and 3500 B. P. All of the <b>adzes</b> we sampled are made of volcanic rock. A diverse selection of raw materials, including basalts, andesites, and dacites, was used in manufacturing the <b>adzes,</b> indicating that they are made of rock deriving from many different geological formations. None of the <b>adzes</b> have identical chemical signatures. There is no evidence of specialized centers for <b>adze</b> production. Some of the <b>adzes</b> were probably produced locally, while others were obtained through exchange. This project sets the stage for future research to trace the development and the extent of southeast China Neolithic exchange networks.

25|$|Another {{group of}} <b>adzes</b> can be {{differentiated}} by the handles; the D-handled <b>adzes</b> have a handle where the hand can be {{wrapped around the}} D, close to the bit.

50|$|Bad Homburg's civic {{coat of arms}} {{was granted}} in 1903 but is said to date from the 15th century {{on the basis of}} seals known from that time, {{although}} they show a saltire rather than the two <b>adzes</b> seen today (the saltire might be two unclear <b>adzes).</b> The reason for the <b>adzes</b> in the arms is not known; it is possibly dialectal canting. The colours, with silver <b>adzes</b> in a blue field, have been in use at least since 1621.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>adze</b> ( [...] ; {{alternative}} spelling: adz) is {{a cutting}} tool shaped somewhat like an axe {{that dates back to}} the stone age. It can be any tool with a sharp cutting edge. <b>Adzes</b> are used for smoothing or carving wood in hand woodworking, similar to an axe but with the cutting edge perpendicular to the handle. Two basic forms of an <b>adze</b> are the hand <b>adze,</b> a short handled tool swung with one hand, and a foot <b>adze,</b> a long handled tool capable of powerful swings using both hands, the cutting edge usually striking at foot or shin level. The blade of an <b>adze</b> is set at right angles to the tool's shaft (like a hoe or plane), in contrast to an axe's blade, which is in plane with the shaft. A similar, but blunt, tool used for digging in hard ground is called a mattock.|$|R
40|$|Stone <b>adzes</b> {{are found}} {{throughout}} the Pacific islands and documenting their diversity is critical to understanding relationships between past human populations. The <b>adze</b> typology devised by Roger Duff {{half a century ago}} is the standard across New Zealand and the rest of Polynesia. Here we describe the different types in the Duff system and analyse 148 <b>adzes</b> from the Wairau Bar site, which has a high diversity of complete <b>adzes</b> and is the assemblage that Duff used as the basis of his system. We use Principal Components Analysis of morphometric variables to test the empirical basis of the Duff system - an analytical exercise that should have applicability to typological systems elsewhere. Our results show different Duff types clustering separately to an extent, but there are issues of ambiguity in assigning types. Duff emphasized cross-section shape and the elaboration of the tang. We propose a new classification system that emphasizes technological and functional features of the <b>adzes.</b> There is considerable agreement between Duff 2 ̆ 7 s system and ours, as different manufacturing methods create different cross-section shapes, and functional modifications are often related to the <b>adze</b> tang. We describe four main manufacturing methods with functional elaborations, resulting in nine different <b>adze</b> types that are represented by at least 3 specimens each at Wairau Bar. Examples of each of these <b>adze</b> types are illustrated. We also note the presence of 2 ̆ 7 stitched 2 ̆ 7 edges on some <b>adzes</b> likely resulting from fine punch work. The Wairau Bar <b>adzes</b> are some of the finest examples of knapping skill known anywhere in the world and suggest a high level of craft specialization...|$|R

40|$|The use of <b>adze</b> {{sourcing}} {{to study}} interaction spheres opens new perspectives on ancient Polynesian voyaging. Our work contributes to this effort by documenting the discovery and geochemical {{signature of the}} Vitaria <b>Adze</b> Quarry, a major <b>adze</b> quarry complex in the central East Polynesia core area. We present WD-XRF geochemical data for the Vitaria raw material and ethnographically collected <b>adzes</b> from Raivavae and Tubuai Islands, {{also part of the}} Australs. Comparison of our results with previously published artifact and source data shows that initial tool production at the Vitaria <b>Adze</b> Quarry coincides with the human colonization of East Polynesia. Artifacts from Rurutu were exchanged within the Australs, as well as to neighboring archipelagoes, indicating the importance of Rurutu as a node in voyaging networks spanning the East Polynesian homeland area.

40|$|New {{method for}} a {{metrical}} and typological classification of stone <b>adzes</b> and picks of the Neolithic Age. For the stone <b>adzes</b> of the Danubian Neolithic, which {{are marked by}} an unsymmetrical structure in the front view, the starting points for building a typology are absent so far. The described method considers the unsymmetry of the perforated implements for instance <b>adzes</b> and picks, and can also {{be applied to the}} symmetrically formed implements. The body of the <b>adze</b> gets divided into a neckpart and a cutting part with the help of circle-arcs. The designation of the <b>adzes</b> and picks occurs by two correlated figures, the neck- and cutting part, {{as well as by the}} information about the cutting part length. With the help of this new graphical method, the perforated stone implements of the Danubian Neolithic and the following cultures can be typologically recorded...|$|R
50|$|Manufactured {{from the}} hinge {{line of a}} giant clam (Tridacna gigas), the shell <b>adze</b> was found {{associated}} with a Neolithic burial assemblage in Duyong Cave, Quezon, Palawan. This shell tool {{is similar to the}} shell <b>adzes</b> recovered in Okinawa, Japan. Shells were used as tools in the Pacific as a replacement for hard stones which were not available on the islands. The presence of shell <b>adzes</b> not only in Palawan but also in Tawi-Tawi is very significant in the study of movements of people from the insular Southeast Asia to the Pacific. This shell tool is similar to the shell <b>adzes</b> recovered in Micronesia and Ryukyu Islands in Okinawa, Japan.|$|R

40|$|Polynesian stone <b>adze</b> {{quarries}} {{anchor the}} system of tool production, distribution and consumption and are critical for examining changing social organization, symbolic values attributed to particular stone sources, economic intensification and ancient interaction. Although major <b>adze</b> quarries are known from most Polynesian archipelagos, a geologically informed archaeological survey was designed for discovering the variability in stone-tool-quality rock sources. Thirteen quarries and sources within the 20, 000 hectare traditional land unit of Kaluako 2 ̆ 7 i (literally, the <b>adze</b> pit) on Moloka 2 ̆ 7 i, Hawaiian Islands, vary considerably in size, production output and settlement context, suggesting that individual <b>adze</b> quarries were accorded different roles across the social landscape. Some sixty-four radiocarbon age determinations and U-series dates from quarries and habitation sites with artefacts originating from quarries, document the temporal sequence of use beginning in the Late Expansion Period (AD 1400 - 1650), at least two centuries after settlement of the island.

40|$|Detailed study ofadze {{production}} sites at Pohakuloa by the University ofHawai 'i Archaeological Field School provided new insights on traditional Hawaiian economic organization.
