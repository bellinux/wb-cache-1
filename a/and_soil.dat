5|$|Authors {{of books}} {{left the country}} in droves and some wrote {{material}} critical of the regime while in exile. Goebbels recommended that the remaining authors concentrate on books themed on Germanic myths {{and the concept of}} blood <b>and</b> <b>soil.</b> By the end of 1933, over a thousand books—most of them by Jewish authors or featuring Jewish characters—had been banned by the Nazi regime.|$|E
5|$|Because {{scratches}} {{dominate the}} microwear {{texture of the}} teeth, Williams et al. suggested Edmontosaurus was a grazer instead of a browser, which would be predicted to have fewer scratches due to eating less abrasive materials.

The tooth structure indicates combined slicing and grinding capabilities.|$|E
40|$|Management and {{planning}} activities {{with respect to}} food production require accurate and timely information on crops <b>and</b> <b>soils</b> on a global basis.

In order to obtain this knowledge, the development of a crops <b>and</b> <b>soils</b> scene radiation research data base was initiated.

5|$|People {{sometimes}} suspected vampirism when a cadaver did {{not look}} as they thought a normal corpse should when disinterred. Rates of decomposition vary depending on temperature <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> composition, {{and many of the}} signs are little known.

5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} linked to {{outbreaks}} of some food-borne illnesses, including Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum. The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores were found on whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance. Shigella species are able to survive in shredded cabbage. Two outbreaks of E.coli in the United States have been linked to cabbage consumption. Biological risk assessments have concluded that there is the potential for further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes. Contaminants from water, humans, animals <b>and</b> <b>soil</b> have the potential to be transferred to cabbage, and from there to the end consumer.|$|E
