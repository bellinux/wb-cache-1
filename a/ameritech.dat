5|$|The AT Plaza is {{a public}} space that hosts the Cloud Gate sculpture. The plaza opened in July 2004 with the {{unveiling}} of the sculpture during the grand opening weekend of the park. <b>Ameritech</b> donated $3million for the naming right for the plaza, but it was SBC Plaza when the park opened, as a merger had changed the company name to SBC Communications. The 2005 merger of SBC and AT Corporation led to the present name. The sculpture and the AT Plaza are located on top of Park Grill, between the Chase Promenade and McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink. The plaza has become a place to view the McCormick Tribune Plaza & Ice Rink. During the holiday season, the plaza hosts Christmas caroling.|$|E

40|$|Formal {{regulatory}} parity can entail counterintuitive effects. In {{a series}} of state statutes, municipal governments have been directed to issue cable TV franchises to new competitors only after (a) formal hearings considering the 'public interest' in competition; and (b) imposing terms and conditions which {{are at least as}} burdensome as those contained in the incumbent's franchise. While billed as 'level playing field' laws, economic theory, an important case study in Connecticut, and a probit analysis of <b>Ameritech's</b> cable franchise acquisition strategy suggest that these statutes actually tilt the field against entrants. ...|$|R
5000|$|Following the {{successful}} launch of 1-800-COLLECT, AT&T {{responded with a}} competing 1-800 phone number providing discounted collect calling, 1-800-OPERATOR. However, {{a significant portion of}} calls intended for 1-800-OPERATOR misspelled [...] "Operator" [...] as [...] "Operater". The numerical translation for 1-800-OPERATER (1-800-673-7283) was, at the time, assigned for routing to the MCI network, which capitalized on the large number of spelling errors by connecting those calls to 1-800-COLLECT. After several months, AT&T realized they were inadvertently directing a portion of their business to MCI and terminated the 1-800-OPERATOR service, replacing it with 1-800-CALL-ATT. The local telephone companies, who lost a significant amount of business to both numbers, started fighting back with ads showing how much simpler it was to just dial 0 (<b>Ameritech's</b> ad said [...] "Why push 800 numbers when you can just push one?") or later pushing calling cards as an alternative to calling someone collect.|$|R
