We now report that specific integrins expressed on platelets and endothelial cells permit the cellular entry of HPS-associated hantaviruses. Infection with HPS-associated hantaviruses, NY- 1 and Sin Nombre virus (SNV), is inhibited by antibodies to β 3 integrins and by the β 3 -integrin ligand, vitronectin. In contrast, infection with the nonpathogenic (no associated human disease) Prospect Hill virus was inhibited by fibronectin and β 1 -specific antibodies but not by β 3 -specific antibodies or vitronectin. Transfection with recombinant αIIbβ 3 or αvβ 3 integrins rendered cells permissive to NY- 1 and SNV but not Prospect Hill virus infection, indicating that αIIbβ 3 and αvβ 3 integrins mediate the entry of NY- 1 and SNV hantaviruses. Furthermore, entry is divalent cation independent, not blocked by <b>arginine-glycine-aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>peptides</b> and still mediated by, ligand-binding defective, αIIbβ 3 -integrin mutants. Hence, NY- 1 and SNV entry is independent of β 3 integrin binding to physiologic ligands.

We investigated the role of acid sphingomyelinase (Asm) in the hematogenous metastasis of melanoma cells. Intrave-nous injection of B 16 F 10 melanoma cells into wild-type mice resulted in multiple lung metastases, while Asm-deficient mice (Smpd 1 / mice) were protected from pulmonary tumor spread. Transplanting wild-type platelets into Asm-deficient mice rein-stated tumor metastasis. Likewise, Asm-deficient mice were protected from hematogenous MT/ret melanoma metastasis to the spleen in a mouse model of spontaneous tumor metastasis. Human and mouse melanoma cells triggered activation and release of platelet secretory Asm, in turn leading to ceramide formation, clus-tering, and activation of a 5 b 1 integrins on melanoma cells finally leading to adhesion of the tumor cells. Clustering of integrins by applying purified Asm or C 16 ceramide to B 16 F 10 melanoma cells before intravenous injection restored trapping of tumor cells in the lung in Asm-deficient mice. This effect was revertable by <b>arginine-glycine-aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>peptides,</b> which are known inhibitors of inte-grins, and by antibodies neutralizing b 1 integrins.

Human CAT and its derivatives were expressed in yeast Pichia pastoris and purified. The specific activity and secondary structure of hCAT-(RGD) 3 and hCAT-R 9 were close to those of hCAT, but these derivatives showed higher binding to the mouse aortic vascular endothelial cell line MAEC than hCAT, indicating that they are cytophilic derivatives. Hypoxic treatment of MAEC increased the intracellular ROS level, the binding of mouse melanoma cells, and the activity of transcription factors, hypoxia inducible factor- 1 and nuclear factor-kappaB. hCAT-(RGD) 3 or hCAT-R 9 efficiently inhibited these changes compared with hCAT.

However, surface modification of these materials to control the degradation rate {{in the early stages}} of healing and improve their biocompatibility is crucial to the successful implementation of magnesium alloy implants in medicine. Cell adhesion and proliferation at the implant surface is a vital factor for successful integration of a biomaterial within the body.

We used αvβ 3 -positive melanoma cells transfected with a reporter comprised of the firefly luciferase gene interrupted by an abnormally spliced intron. Intranuclear delivery of a specific antisense oligonucleotide (termed 623) corrects splicing and allows luciferase expression in these cells. The RGD– 623 conjugate or a cationic lipid- 623 complex produced significant increases in luciferase expression, while ‘free’ 623 did not. However, the kinetics of luciferase expression was distinct; the RGD– 623 conjugate produced a gradual increase followed by a gradual decline, while the cationic lipid- 623 complex caused a rapid increase followed by a monotonic decline. The subcellular distribution of the oligonucleotide delivered using cationic lipids included both cytoplasmic vesicles and the nucleus, while the RGD– 623 conjugate was primarily found in cytoplasmic vesicles that partially co-localized with a marker for caveolae. Both the cellular uptake and the biological effect of the RGD– 623 conjugate were blocked by excess RGD peptide. These observations suggest that the bivalent RGD peptide–oligonucleotide conjugate enters cells via a process of receptor-mediated endocytosis mediated by the αvβ 3 integrin...|$|E

Atropine and 1, 1 -dimethyl- 4 -diphenylacetoxypiperidinium iodide inhibitors reduced the heparin-dependent relaxation, indicating that M- 3 muscarinic receptor is involved in this phenomenon. However, no direct binding of heparin to muscarinic receptors was observed. More importantly, studies performed using the <b>arginine-glycine-aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>peptide</b> and 1 -(1, 1 -dimethylethyl) - 3 -(1 -naphthalenyl) - 1 H-pyrazolo[3, 4 -day]pyrimidin- 4 -amine, an Src family inhibitor, reduced by 51 % and 73 % the heparin-dependent relaxation, respectively, suggesting the coupling of heparin and M- 3 receptor through extracellular matrix molecules and integrin.

This means that the harmful side effects and off-target of drugs can damage healthy cells during treatment. To resolve this problem, various nanocarriers such as liposomes, micelles, and metal nanoparticles have been used to reach specific cells or organs of interest using a targeting ligand such as cell penetrating peptides, folate, or a short RGD peptide sequence grafted to the surface [1]. RGD (<b>arginine-glycine-aspartic</b> <b>acid)</b> <b>peptide</b> demonstrates preferential binding ability to the integrin αvβ 3. The role of integrins in the migration and invasion of tumors has been demonstrated, for a long time [2]. RGD-targeted nanocarriers present a promising approach for targeting tumor cells or tumor vasculature to deliver anticancer drugs or contrast agents for theranostics. Such nanocarriers could enter specific target cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis [3, 4]. The extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, growth factors, cytokines, immunoglobulin, and matrix-degrading proteases have RGD sequence that interacts with integrin receptors at the focal region of adhesion. Integrins are the cell adhesion receptors made of a single alpha and a single beta chain with activated and non-activated forms. Integrins such as αvβ 3 have an important role in tumor growth regulation and angiogenesis {{as well as in the}} metastasis.

To examine the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to anoikis in human oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells, we cultured human squamous carcinoma (HSC- 3) cells in suspension on plates coated with poly- 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate, which blocks access to the ECM. Cells in suspension that formed multicellular aggregates had significantly lower levels of apoptosis than single cells. Aggregates, but not single cells, had high levels of fibronectin. Preincubation with a cyclic <b>arginine-glycine-aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>peptide</b> or fibronectin-blocking antibody significantly increased anoikis. Single cells had markedly lower expression of the integrin α v receptor than aggregates. Blocking α v function with a blocking antibody or by transfection with an antisense oligonucleotide increased apoptosis and inhibited aggregation. In single cells but not aggregates, phosphorylation of the integrin-associated focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at tyrosine 397 was reduced, and p 53 levels were increased. Apoptosis was increased by blocking FAK with an antisense oligonucleotide and reduced by blocking p 53. These findings show that SCC cells escape suspension-induced anoikis by forming multicellular aggregates that avail themselves of fibronectin survival signals mediated by integrin α v. Single cells in suspension that do not form aggregates undergo anoikis because of decreased FAK phosphorylation and increased p 53 levels.

Efficient targeting of integrin positive tumor in mice was achieved with SWNTs coated with PEG chains linked to an <b>arginine-glycine-aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> (RGD) <b>peptide.</b> A high tumor accumulation was attributed to the multivalent effect of the SWNTs.

The aim of this work was to design and characterize a synthetic RGD biomimetic peptide that includes a collagen-binding domain for easy one-step functionalization of absorbable collagen sponges (ACSs), which are of frequent use in orthopaedic surgery. The stable binding of biotinylated CBD-RGD peptide loaded onto ACSs was confirmed using chemiluminisence detection after washing of the sponges. Furthermore, {{the effect of the}} peptide on MC 3 T 3 -E 1 mouse preosteoblasts and rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vitro was characterized in terms of caspase activity, proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, matrix mineralization and formation of focal adhesions. Finally, a rat ectopic osteogenesis model was used to determine if the co-administration of CBD-RGD could lower the dose of BMP- 2 necessary to induce bone formation. The CBD-RGD peptide was demonstrated to bind stable to ACSs, even after extensive washing. In vitro, the peptide did not induce apoptosis of the cells, but positively affected both cell growth and differentiation. It also seemed to affect the cytoskeleton arrangement of MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells, favoring the establishment of focal adhesions. At last, the in vivo experiments showed that ACSs functionalized with this peptide and loaded with a subfunctional dose of BMP- 2 gave rise to ectopic bone.

MSC adhesion was asymmetrical, with postischemic sections exhibiting more than twofold higher adhesion than controls, and showed preference to perivascular areas. Pretreating kidney sections with cyclic <b>arginine-glycine-aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>peptide</b> resulted in increased MSC adhesion (by displacing resident cells), whereas blockade of CXCR 4 with AMD 3100 and inhibition of α 4 β 1 (VLA 4) integrin or vascular cellular adhesion molecule- 1, reduced adhesion. The difference between adhered cells under cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid peptide-treated and control conditions reflected prior occupancy of binding sites with endogenous cells. The AMD 3100 -inhibitable fraction of adhesion reflected CXCR 4 -dependent adhesion, whereas maximal adhesion was interpreted as kidney MSC-lodging capacity. MSC obtained from mice overexpressing caveolin- 1 exhibited more robust adhesion than those obtained from knockout animals, consistent with CXCR 4 dimerization in caveolae. These data demonstrate a) CXCR 4 /SDF- 1 -dependent adhesion increases in ischemia; b) CXCR 4 /SDF- 1 activation is dependent on MSC surface caveolin- 1; and c) occupancy of MSC binding sites is decreased, while d) capacity of MSC binding sites is expanded in postischemic kidneys.

The RPG 1 protein is constitutively expressed and not phosphorylated. On inoculation with avirulent urediniospores, it is phosphorylated in vivo within 5 min and subsequently degraded. Application of <b>arginine-glycine-aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>peptide</b> loops prevented the formation of adhesion structures for spore attachment, the phosphorylation of RPG 1, and germination of the viable spores. Arginine-glycine-aspartic acid affinity chromatography of proteins from the ungerminated avirulent rust spores led to the purification and identification of a protein with fibronectin type III and breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein domains and a vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 9 with a coupling of ubiquitin to endoplasmic reticulum degradation domain. Both proteins are required to induce in vivo phosphorylation and degradation of RPG 1.

30|$|Polymersomes (Ps) (also {{referred}} to as polymeric vesicles) or polymer-based colloidal carriers have attracted rapidly growing interest based on their stimulating aggregation phenomena, cell and virus-mimicking dimensions and functions [114]. Ps are artificial vesicles that contain an aqueous solution in the core bounded by a bilayer membrane. The bilayer membrane is composed of hydrated hydrophilic coronas (e.g., PEG) together {{inside and outside of}} hydrophobic middle part of the membrane. The aqueous core can be utilized for the encapsulation of therapeutic hydrophilic molecules and the membrane can amalgamate hydrophobic drugs within its hydrophobic part [115, 116, 117]. Due to the relatively thick membranes, Ps can be rather stable. The existence of a hydrophilic PEG brush on the surface will reduce the protein adsorption onto the Ps during the blood circulation. Permeability, rate of degradation and stimuli-sensitivity of the membranes can be varied using various biodegradable and/or stimuli-responsive block copolymers to modulate the release of the encapsulated drugs. End groups of the PEG can be utilize to immobilize homing moieties like antibodies or <b>arginine–glycine–aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> (RGD)-containing <b>peptides,</b> which are able to recognize target cells or tissues.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Due to the {{selective}} {{expression of the}} α v β 3 integrin in tumors, radiolabeled <b>arginine–glycine–aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> (RGD) <b>peptides</b> are attractive candidates for tumor targeting. Minor modifications of these peptides could {{have a major impact}} on in vivo characteristics. In this study, we systematically investigated the effects of linker modification between two cyclic RGD sequences and DOTA (1, 4, 7, 10 -tetraazadodecane-N,N′,N ʺ,N ‴ -tetraacetic acid) on the in vitro and in vivo characteristics of the tracer. Methods: A dimeric RGD peptide was synthesized and conjugated either directly with DOTA or via different linkers: PEG 4 (polyethylene glycol), glutamic acid or lysine. The RGD peptides were radiolabeled with 111 In, and their in vitro and in vivo α v β 3 -binding characteristics were determined. Results: LogP values varied between − 2. 82 ± 0. 06 and − 3. 95 ± 0. 33. The IC 50 values for DOTA-E-[c(RGDfK) ] 2, DOTA-PEG 4 -E-[c(RGDfK) ] 2, DOTA-E-E-[c(RGDfK) ] 2 and DOTA-K-E-[c(RGDfK) ] 2 were comparable. Two hours after injection, the tumor uptakes of the 111 In-labeled compounds were not significantly different. The kidney accumulation of [111 In]-DOTA-K-E-[c(RGDfK) ] 2 [4. 05 ± 0. 20...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSoft tissue {{adhesion}} on titanium {{represents a}} challenge for implantable materials. In order to improve adhesion at the cell/material interface we used a new approach based on the molecular recognition of titanium by specific peptides. Silk fibroin protein was chemically grafted with titanium binding peptide (TiBP) to increase adsorption of these chimeric proteins to the metal surface. A quartz crystal microbalance was used to quantify the specific adsorption of TiBP-functionalized silk {{and an increase in}} protein deposition by more than 35 % was demonstrated due to the presence of the binding peptide. A silk protein grafted with TiBP and fibronectin-derived <b>arginine-glycine-aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> (RGD) <b>peptide</b> was then prepared. The adherence of fibroblasts on the titanium surface modified with the multifunctional silk coating demonstrated {{an increase in the number}} of adhering cells by 60 %. The improved adhesion was demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy and immunocytochemical staining of focal contact points. Chick embryo organotypic culture also revealed strong adhesion of endothelial cells expanding on the multifunctional silk peptide coating. These results demonstrated that silk functionalized with TiBP and RGD represents a promising approach to modify cell-biomaterial interfaces, opening new perspectives for implantable medical devices, especially when reendothelialization is required...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{treatment}} of a brain glioma {{remains one of the}} most difficult challenges in oncology. In the present study a delivery system was developed for targeted drug delivery across the blood‑brain barrier (BBB) to the brain cancer cells. A cyclic <b>arginine‑glycine‑aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> (RGD) <b>peptide</b> and transferrin (TF) were utilized as targeting ligands. Cyclic RGD peptides are specific targeting ligands of cancer cells and TFs are ligands that specifically target the BBB and cancer cells. Liposome (LP) was used to conjugate the cyclic RGD and TFs to establish the brain glioma cascade delivery system (RGD/TF‑LP). The LPs were prepared by the thin film hydration method and physicochemical characterization was conducted. In vitro cell uptake and three‑dimensional tumor spheroid penetration studies demonstrated that the system could target endothelial and tumor cells, as well as penetrate the tumor cells to reach the core of the tumor spheroids. The results of the in vivo imaging further demonstrated that the RGD/TF‑LP provided the highest brain distribution. As a result, the paclitaxel‑loaded RGD/TF‑LP presents the best anti-proliferative activity against C 6 cells and tumor spheroids. In conclusion, the RGD/TF‑LP may precisely target brain glioma, which may be valuable for glioma imaging and therapy...|$|R
40|$|Generation of {{supporting}} structures, which guide cell growth, is a challenging {{task in the}} field of tissue engineering. Cell guidance properties of a scaffold are important {{in the field of}} neuronal regeneration. Those guiding structures can provide guidance just by mechanical stimulus or by chemical stimuli like cell signaling molecules. For an enhanced guidance, chemical gradients are under investigation. With this study, we show that ultraviolet laser irradiation is a useful tool to activate polymer surfaces with a high temporal and spatial resolution. We demonstrated that poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly-?-caprolactone (PCL) can be locally activated and functionalized with amine groups {{that can be used for}} immobilization of <b>arginine–glycine–aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> (RGD) <b>peptide.</b> The immobilized RGD was detected by neuronal B 35 cells. By defined pulse accumulation functionalization density on the surface can be varied for the generation of gradients. We demonstrated that PMMA and PCL have different process windows for functionalization. Although PMMA has a very small process window for activation, PCL allows the generation of stepwise functionalization. The presented technology can help to develop assays for the analysis of cell migration and neuronal regeneration due to flexible patterning easily realized by changing the irradiation parameters...|$|R
40|$|The {{adhesion}} molecule αvβ 3 integrin {{plays an important}} role in tumor development and metastases. We demonstrated the specificity of the probe to αvβ 3 integrin with transmission electron microcopy (TEM) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The in vivo targeting behavior of the probe was examined in 2 tumor models with different αvβ 3 expression patterns by a 3. 0 T MRI scanner. MR imaging showed that R 2 * pseudo-color pictures of A 549 lung cancer tumor was different from that of 3 LL lung cancer. For A 549 tumor, an homogeneous decrease of signal intensity was observed throughout the tumor, which was more evident in the periphery or central areas. Histological studies revealed that αvβ 3 integrin was expressed both on the tumor vessel and tumor cells for A 549 tumor. Our findings indicated that it was possible to noninvasively characterize the different αvβ 3 expression pattern in lung cancers with <b>arginine-glycine-aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> (RGD) <b>peptide</b> conjugated ultra-small superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (RGD-USPIO) using a clinical 3. 0 T MR scanner. Nevertheless, the way of imaging targeting presentation of the probe differed in tumors with different αvβ 3 expression patterns...|$|R
40|$|The {{organization}} of actin microfilaments was studied by immunofluorescence in protoplasts isolated from sunflower hypocotyls and cultured in an agarose matrix. Removal {{of the cell}} wall completely disrupted the actin cytoskeleton, which became progressively reorganized into cortical microfilament arrays and actin cables during protoplast culture. Treatment of protoplasts with <b>arginine-glycine-aspartic</b> <b>acid</b> (Arg-Gly-Asp) motif-containing <b>peptides,</b> to inhibit putative cell contacts with the agarose matrix, strongly affected this repair process: microfilament elongation and cable formation were inhibited and the connectivity between the cortical network and the perinuclear basket was lost. Furthermore, embryoid formation induced by agarose embedding was reduced. Similar effects were observed with a short treatment with latrunculin B, known to disrupt actin microfilaments. These {{results indicate that the}} actin network is involved in the signalling process that leads to polarity acquisition and embryoid determination in agarose-embedded protoplasts...|$|R
40|$|Mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) have {{attracted}} {{great interest in}} recent years for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications due to their ease of isolation and multipotent differentiation capacity. In the past, MSC research has focussed {{on the effects of}} soluble cues, such as growth factors and cytokines; however, there is now increasing interest in understanding how parameters such as substrate modulus, specific extracellular matrix (ECM) components {{and the ways in which}} these are presented to the cell can influence MSC properties. Here we use surfaces of self-assembled maleimide-functionalized polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene oxide) copolymers (PS-PEO-Ma) to investigate how the spatial arrangement of cell adhesion ligands affects MSC behaviour. By changing the ratio of PS-PEO-Ma in mixtures of block copolymer and polystyrene homopolymer, we can create surfaces with lateral spacing of the PEO-Ma domains ranging from 34 to 62 nm. Through subsequent binding of cysteine–GRGDS peptides to the maleimide-terminated end of the PEO chains in each of these domains, we are able to present tailored surfaces of controlled lateral spacing of RGD (<b>arginine-glycine-aspartic</b> <b>acid)</b> <b>peptides</b> to MSCs. We demonstrate that adhesion of MSCs to the RGD-functionalized block-copolymer surfaces is through specific attachment to the presented RGD motif and that this is mediated by α 5, αV, β 1 and β 3 integrins. We show that as the lateral spacing of the peptides is increased, the ability of the MSCs to spread is diminished and that the morphology changes from well-spread cells with normal fibroblastic morphology and defined stress-fibres, to less-spread cells with numerous cell protrusions and few stress fibres. In addition, the ability of MSCs to form mature focal adhesions is reduced on substrates with increased lateral spacing. Finally, we investigate differentiation and use qRT-PCR determination of gene expression levels and a quantitative alkaline phosphatase assay to show that MSC osteogenesis is reduced on surfaces with increased lateral spacing while adipogenic differentiation is increased. We show here, for the first time, that the lateral spacing of adhesion peptides affects human MSC (hMSC) properties and might therefore be a useful parameter with which to modify hMSC behaviour in future tissue engineering strategies...|$|R
