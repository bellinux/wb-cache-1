40|$|Strip casting is a rapid {{processing}} {{technique used}} {{in the production of}} alloys for both sintered and HDDR bonded NdFeB magnets. During strip casting, molten alloys are gravity fed onto a rotating copper wheel. The rapid cooling rate produces NdFeB microstructures which have many advantages over conventionally cast NdFeB book-mould alloys such as less <b>alpha</b> <b>iron,</b> near stoichiometric alloy compositions and a finer grain structure. The wheel texture of a pilot scale strip caster was altered in order to optimize the microstructure and improve the consistency of strip cast flakes for the production of NdFeB sintered magnets. This made it possible to reduce the flake thickness distribution and <b>alpha</b> <b>iron</b> content, improve the grain size consistency and increase lamellar alignment. In NdFeB alloys for HDDR (Hydrogenation Disproportionation Desorption and Recombination) powders, which are used in bonded magnets, a large grained material is preferable with little or no <b>alpha</b> <b>iron.</b> By implementing a combination of surface texture and reduced wheel speed, the grain width was increased from 5 to 40 μm, whilst maintaining a low <b>alpha</b> <b>iron</b> content.

Results Many different treatment options have been tried over the past several decades, including antihistamines, antidepressants, interferon <b>alpha,</b> phlebotomy, phototherapy, <b>iron</b> supplements and myelosuppressive medications, all demonstrating mixed results. Recently, agents that target JAK 2 and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) have shown impressive clinical benefit.
