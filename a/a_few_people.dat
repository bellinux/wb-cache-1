Shortly thereafter, Walter Burch, an acquaintance of the Davidson family, tried to develop the cave as a business. Burch and his partners opened what they called Limestone Caves and charged visitors $1 each for a guided cave trip, a camping spot, pasture for horses, and cave water they described as medicinal. Although Burch and others hacked crude trails to the cave from Cave Junction and Williams, the trip was too difficult for most tourists, and Limestone Caves ceased operations in 1888.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> have {{questioned}} {{this version of}} events. In the early 1980s, two books, one written by Arnold Brackman and another by John Langdon Brooks, even suggested not only {{that there had been}} a conspiracy to rob Wallace of his proper credit, but that Darwin had actually stolen a key idea from Wallace to finish his own theory. These claims have been examined in detail by a number of scholars who have not found them to be convincing. Research into shipping schedules has shown that, contrary to these accusations, Wallace's letter could not have been delivered earlier than the date shown in Darwin's letter to Lyell.|$|E

Hitchcock, {{who had come to}} face genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own, was seeking new material to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount, Flamingo Feather and No Bail for the Judge.

Delusions ("non-bizarre") are also present in delusional disorder, and social withdrawal in social anxiety disorder, avoidant personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder has symptoms that are similar but less severe than those of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) considerably more often than {{could be explained by}} chance, although {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish obsessions that occur in OCD from the delusions of schizophrenia. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> withdrawing from benzodiazepines experience a severe withdrawal syndrome which may last a long time.

5|$|At the {{southwest}} corner of the same intersection, the building housing Sidetrack Bar & Grillwhich has held a bar and restaurant continuously since at least 1850has an unusual shape resulting from a 1929 train derailment. On an early January morning, the twelfth car, laden with lumber, of an 85-car freight train came off the tracks and crashed into the corner of the building. The owner of the building, who lived just above the section that was hit, was uninjured but had most of her personal effects scattered into the street. There were only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> near the railroad crossing when it derailed including an 18-year-old female who was knocked unconscious and a man who was sitting in his car, but was able to get away unharmed. When the current owners went to build a patio on the spot, they found some of the debris had been piled up underneath, which made it more difficult to dig post holes. In 1931, the entrance to the building was moved from the east side to its current position on the north side to accommodate a post-prohibition law requiring bar entrances to be at least 500 feet from any church. The back patio was constructed after the nearby church burned down. According to Sidetrack owner Linda French, the first-floor walls are three bricks deep, with the oldest remaining bricks dating to the 1850s.|$|E

5|$|Once Montgomery {{had flown}} out, another two C-130s arrived in Khâm Đức to {{continue}} the evacuation; the first aircraft picked up 130 people, and the one after that took out 90. There were now only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> remaining {{on the ground in}} Khâm Đức, and most of them were U.S. Special Forces soldiers and indigenous CIDG personnel. Major James L. Wallace flew into Khâm Đức and extracted the last group of people, as the ammunition dumps began to explode, and the aircrews reported witnessing hysteria among the Vietnamese soldiers who had lost family members in Bucher's crash. However, just when the aircrews believed the mission was over, a C-130 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Jay Van Cleeff was ordered to reinsert the three-man Combat Control Team, which had been airlifted out of the compound earlier in the day by Colonel Cole. In protest, Van Cleeff argued that the camp was almost completely evacuated, but the control center insisted that the Combat Control Team be reinserted to complete their task of coordinating the evacuation. At about 16:20, Van Cleeff landed his aircraft on the runway and the Combat Control Team – led by Major John W. Gallagher – immediately disembarked from the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Selena {{signed a}} record deal with EMI {{subsidiary}} SBK Records in November 1993, following her Grammy Award nomination for Live (1993). The {{news of the}} singer's record deal was front-page news in Billboard magazine. In a 1994 meeting, Selena expressed her guilt to Behar; Selena had told interviewers of her upcoming crossover album and told them the recording {{was expected to be}} release soon. At the time, Selena had not recorded a single song for her planned English-language debut. Behar subsequently told Koppelman that Selena and her band would leave EMI and find a record company willing to record an English-language album for Selena. Behar had lied to the chairman to force the crossover album to begin; EMI relented and the recording sessions began. Selena said she felt intimidated by the recording deal because the situation was new to her and only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> had believed she would achieve success in the pop market.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{direction}} of Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler and the supervision of SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich, the Einsatzgruppen operated in territories occupied by the German armed forces following the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and Operation Barbarossa (the invasion of the Soviet Union) launched from occupied Poland in June 1941. The Einsatzgruppen worked hand-in-hand with the Orpo Police Battalions on the Eastern Front to carry out operations ranging from the murder of <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> to operations which lasted over two or more days, such as the massacre at Babi Yar with 33,771 Jews killed in two days, and the Rumbula massacre (with about 25,000 killed in two days of shooting). As ordered by Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, the Wehrmacht cooperated with the Einsatzgruppen and provided logistical support for their operations. Historian Raul Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the Einsatzgruppen and related auxiliary troops killed {{more than two million}} people, including 1.3 million Jews. The total number of Jews murdered during the Holocaust is estimated at 5.5 to 6 million people.|$|E
