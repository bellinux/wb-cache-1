5|$|Without Marguerite Louise {{to occupy}} his attentions, Cosimo turned to persecuting the Jewish {{population}} of Tuscany. Sexual Intercourse between Jews and Christians was proscribed, {{and by a}} law promulgated on 1 July 1677, Christians could not work in establishments owned by Jews. If they did regardless, a fine of 50 crowns was incurred; if the person in question had insufficient funds, he was liable to be tortured on the rack; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> deemed unfit for torture, a four-month prison sentence was substituted. The anti-Semitic roster was supplemented by further declarations on 16 June 1679 and 12 December 1680 banning Jews from visiting Christian prostitutes and co-habitation, respectively.|$|E
5|$|At {{the village}} of Kusić in Banat, a man named Ilija Bordan was {{regarded}} to be alovit; the villagers talked {{that he had a}} tail. Whenever a thunderstorm came, his appearance changed—he fought with an ala. If the ala was overwhelming him, Ilija would lie down and sleep, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> overpowering her, the clouds would start to dissipate. There was a tale in the same village about an alovit man who would warn the villagers of the approach of a thunderstorm, before he took a wagon pole on his back and flew into the clouds. At {{the village of}} Sokolovac in Banat, people told of an alovit man who had four nipples. At the sight of hail clouds, he would mount his mare and disappear for several days. The latter two men would come back tired, bruised, and with torn clothes. As held in the central Serbian region of Gruža, men could become dragonlike. As such, they would suddenly disappear during thunderstorms, and fly into the dark clouds to fight against ale. They were characterized as nimble, hot-tempered, rash and very strong. At a village near Radomir in western Bulgaria, there was a dragon man who was said to have been physically crippled by an ala.|$|E

25|$|Kufa, a {{garrison}} town in Iraq, {{had been}} Ali's capital, {{and many of}} his supporters lived there. Hussein ibn Ali received letters from Kufa expressing its offer of support if he claimed the caliphate. As he prepared for the journey to Kufa, Abdullah ibn Umar, Abdullah ibn Zubayr and Abdullah ibn Abbas argued against his plan, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> determined to proceed to Kufa, asked him to leave women and children in Mecca, but Hussein rejected their suggestions. On the way to Kufa, he received the report of Muslim ibn Aqeel's death at the hands of Yazid's men and that the Kufans had changed their loyalties to Yazid, pledging support to him against Husayn and his followers.|$|E
25|$|As {{a general}} rule, provincial governorships in the Umayyad era were almost always staffed {{exclusively}} by Arabs, and this trend {{was reflected in}} the appointees to Sind during this period. Tribal politics also played a strong role in the selection and dismissal of governors; if the governor of Iraq was a Qaysi, then his governor to Sind would likely be a Qaysi, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a Yamani, his selection would likely be a Yamani as well. There were, however, some exceptions to this; al-Junayd ibn 'Abd al-Rahman al-Murri, for example, was initially appointed to Sind by a fellow Qaysi, but was allowed to retain his position for two years after the governor of Iraq was replaced with a Yamani.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the guards}} {{were able to}} get into the cells, they {{stripped}} the inmates naked, tore apart the beds and the cell, and put the prisoners who had started the rebellion in solitary confinement. As all nine guards could not be on duty at once, they began rewarding the prisoners for good behavior. The prisoners who had not been involved in starting the riot were allowed to lie in their beds, wash themselves and brush their teeth and eat while those who had started the riot were not allowed to. The guards continued to use tormenting tactics to divide the prisoners and forestall further organized resistance. In the case of one prisoner, who was a smoker, the guards were able to control his behavior because they decided when <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> allowed to smoke.|$|E

500|$|Holloman {{made his}} major league debut on April 14 in a relief appearance. He made in three {{additional}} relief appearances afterward, allowing five runs in 5⅓ innings through his first four games. As a result, Holloman asked Marion for a start, claiming {{he was better}} in that role, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{just going to be}} used as a relief pitcher, he should be sold to another team. Marion gave in, and put him in for a home game on May 6 against the Philadelphia Athletics. On a rainy night before a crowd of 2,473 at Sportsman's Park, Holloman threw a no-hitter in his first major league start. He had two hits as a batter, and recorded three strikeouts en route to the 6–0 victory. [...] In his autobiography, Browns owner Bill Veeck called Holloman's no-hitter [...] "the quaintest no-hitter in the history of the game," [...] saying that his pitches were [...] "belted" [...] all night but he was saved by luck and outstanding defense.|$|E
500|$|At their caucus {{meeting on}} the night of December 10, the Whigs agreed to {{continue}} voting for Winthrop for one more day, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not elected, to switch their support to Morehead, who they believed could hold all of Winthrop's votes and win the votes of the southern Whigs as well as some southern Democrats. They made their intentions known on December 11, {{and by the end of}} the day, Morehead reported that he had received commitments of support from twenty southern Democrats. During the day's voting, the five southern Whigs shifted their support from Gentry to Morehead. This shift cost Morehead the support of many northern Whigs who, at the caucus meeting the night of December 11, declared that Morehead's election [...] "would ruin the Whig party in the North", especially if he gained the support of southern Democrats. Rather than further fracture the caucus, Morehead withdrew his name from consideration. Cobb was finally elected on the sixty-third ballot on December 22.|$|E
500|$|Before {{reporting}} {{to spring training}} for the Blues in early 1910 at Excelsior Springs, Missouri, Stengel was approached by his neighbor, Kid Nichols, a former star pitcher, who advised him {{to listen to his}} manager and to the older players, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> minded to reject their advice, at least think it over for a month or so first. Stengel failed to make the ball club, which was part of the American Association, considered one of the top minor leagues. Kansas City optioned Stengel to the Kankakee Kays of the Class D Northern Association, a lower-level minor league, to gain experience as an outfielder. He had a [...]251 batting average with Kankakee when the league folded in July. He found a place with the Shelbyville Grays, who moved mid-season and became the Maysville Rivermen, of the Class D Blue Grass League, batting [...]221.

500|$|Between 1142 and 1144 RaymondII, Count of Tripoli, {{granted the}} order {{property}} in the county. According to historian Jonathan Riley-Smith, the Hospitallers effectively established a [...] "palatinate" [...] within Tripoli. The property included castles with which the Hospitallers were expected to defend Tripoli. Along with Krak des Chevaliers, the Hospitallers were given four other castles along {{the borders of the}} state which allowed the order to dominate the area. The order's agreement with RaymondII stated that if he did not accompany knights of the order on campaign, the spoils belonged entirely to the order, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> present it was split equally between the count and the order. RaymondII could further not make peace with the Muslims without the permission of the Hospitallers. The Hospitallers made Krak des Chevaliers a center of administration for their new property, undertaking work at the castle that would make {{it one of the most}} elaborate Crusader fortifications in the Levant.|$|E

[...] He credited the club for their conditioning programme but also attributed the good form to casual drinking: [...] "I always have two pints of Guinness on a Friday, sometimes more. It gives me energy, I feel stronger and believe in it." [...] His manager Flynn admitted Thomas [...] "trains when he wants to train," [...] and added: [...] "I will take whatever he's taking to keep him going. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> 10 years younger I'd be able to sell him for £5m." [...] Days after the win, Thomas was charged by North Wales Police for his involvement in a counterfeit currency scam. He was arrested a year later, and following a trial was sentenced to 18 months in jail.|$|E
500|$|Kiprusoff again {{declined}} {{an invitation}} {{to play at the}} 2006 Winter Olympics, citing the need to rest a hip injury. His announcement generated considerable controversy in Finland, where {{the fact that he did}} not miss a game with the Flames due to the injury led some to question if he was injured at all. [...] Country-mate Teemu Selänne questioned the goaltender's lack of interest in playing for the national team, a comment that stung Kiprusoff. When considered to play for the Finns at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Kiprusoff said he would join the team, but only if he felt healthy <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> named the starting goaltender for the team. Kiprusoff was named the starter and allowed only four goals in his team's first four games, leading the Finns to a semifinal game against the United States. The Americans blitzed Kiprusoff early in the game, as he gave up four goals on just seven shots in the first minutes of the game before being replaced in net by Niklas Bäckström. He returned to the net for the bronze medal game, however, leading Finland to a 5–3 victory.|$|E

500|$|When UGA renewed {{its program}} in 1919, their student body staged a parade which mocked Tech's {{continuation}} of football {{during times of}} war. The parade featured a tank-shaped float marked [...] "Argonne" [...] with a sign [...] "Georgia in France 1917" [...] followed by an automobile with three people in Tech sweaters and caps bearing a sign [...] "Tech in Atlanta". A printed program was subsequently distributed in the stands with a similar point. While the Tech faculty was able to prevent a riot, no apology was made, and this act led directly to Tech cutting athletic ties with UGA and canceling several of UGA's home football games at Grant Field (UGA commonly used Grant Field as its home field). [...] Tech and UGA did not compete in athletics until the 1921 Southern Conference basketball tournament. Despite intense pressure on Tech to make amends, Matheson stated {{that he would never}} change his mind unless [...] "due apologies" [...] were offered, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> overruled, he would resign. Regular season competition did not renew until after Matheson's retirement, in a 1925 agreement between the two institutions negotiated by athletic directors J. B. Crenshaw and S. V. Sanford.|$|E
500|$|The wager {{of battle}} {{was not always}} {{available}} to the defendant in an appeal of murder. If the defendant was taken in the mainour (that is, {{in the act of}} committing his crime), if he attempted to escape from prison, or if there was such strong evidence of guilt that there could be no effective denial, the defendant could not challenge. Similarly, if the plaintiff was a woman, above 60years of age, a minor, lame or blind, he or she could decline the challenge, and the case would be determined by a jury. Peers of the realm, priests, and citizens of the City of London could also decline the battle if challenged. If the actual battle took place, it would occur in judicial lists, [...] square, following the taking of oaths against witchcraft and sorcery. If the defendant was defeated, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> still alive, he was to be hanged on the spot; not even the King could pardon him from the divine judgment against him. However, if he defeated his opponent, or if he were able to fend off his opponent from sunrise to sunset, he would go free. If the plaintiff said the word craven ("I am vanquished"), and gave up the fight, he was to be , deprived of the privileges of a freeman, and was liable for damages to his successful opponent.|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} {{between the}} two also saw racial dust-ups caused by perceptions of remarks made by campaign surrogates. [...] In March 2008 Ferraro gave {{an interview with the}} Daily Breeze in which she said: [...] "If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position. <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a woman (of any color) he would not be in this position. He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept." [...] (Ferraro had made a similar comment in 1988 disparaging Jesse Jackson's candidacy in the party's presidential primaries, saying that because of his [...] "radical" [...] views, [...] "if Jesse Jackson were not black, he wouldn't be in the race.") Ferraro justified the statements by referring to her own run for vice president. Echoing a statement she wrote about herself in 1988, Ferraro said that [...] "I was talking about historic candidacies and what I started off by saying (was that) {{if you go back to}} 1984 and look at my historic candidacy, which I had just talked about all these things, in 1984, if my name was Gerard Ferraro instead of Geraldine Ferraro, I would have never been chosen as a vice-presidential candidate. It had nothing to do with my qualification." [...] Her comments resonated with some older white women, but generated an immediate backlash elsewhere. There was strong criticism and charges of racism from many supporters of Obama and Obama called them [...] "patently absurd". Clinton publicly expressed disagreement with Ferraro's remarks, while Ferraro vehemently denied she was a racist. Again speaking to the Breeze, Ferraro responded to the attacks by saying: [...] "I really think they're attacking me because I'm white. How's that?" [...] Ferraro resigned from Clinton's finance committee on , 2008, two days after the firestorm began, saying that she didn't want the Obama camp to use her comments to hurt Clinton's campaign.|$|E
