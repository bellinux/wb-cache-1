40|$|Transition metal <b>alkyls</b> play an {{important}} role in organometallic chemistry. Thus, exploration of uranium <b>alkyls,</b> which are relatively rare, has a high potential for new transformations. Homoleptic uranium(IV) tetra(alkyls) are difficult to isolate, due to their notorious instability at room temperature. Recently, tetrabenzyluranium, U(CH 2 C 6 H 5) 4, was synthesized, characterized, and showed reductive elimination chemistry with the use of redox active α-diimine and iminoquinone ligands. A family of homoleptic tetra(alkyls) with different para- and meta-substituted benzyl ligands has been explored to determine the generality of the synthetic method and the effect of ring substitution on complex stability and reductive elimination capabilities. The kinetics of the reductive elimination reaction from the uranium(IV) tetra <b>alkyls</b> induced by redox active ligands has been measured to better understand the rates of this process. ^ While uranium(IV) <b>alkyls</b> are rare and interesting, low valent uranium(III) <b>alkyls</b> examples are even more uncommon. By using large tridentate hydrotrispyrazolylborate type ligands to stabilize the reactive uranium metal center a family of uranium(III) <b>alkyls</b> could be synthesized. These compounds feature benzyl type ligands which have been shown to bind in different hapticities. The increased hapticity of the ligand offers increased stability by creating a more coordinatively saturated metal center. These low valent uranium <b>alkyls</b> have the potential for unique reactivity and can be used as precursors to uranium multiple bonds, such as imidos, oxos and sulfidos. ...|$|R
40|$|We use a layered {{solution}} {{crystal growth}} technique to synthesize high-quality single crystals of phenylalkylammonium lead iodide organic/inorganic hybrid compounds. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals low-dimensional structures consisting of inorganic sheets separated by bilayers {{of the organic}} cations. The shortest <b>alkyls</b> yield two-dimensional structures consisting of inorganic sheets of corner-sharing PbI 6 -octahedra. However, the longer <b>alkyls</b> induce both corner- and face-sharing of the PbI 6 -octahedra, and form new compounds. Density functional theory calculations including spin-orbit coupling show quantum confinement in two dimensions for the shorter <b>alkyls,</b> and in one dimension for the longer <b>alkyls,</b> respectively. The face-sharing PbI 6 -octahedra create a confinement leading to effectively one-dimensional behavior. These confinement effects {{are responsible for the}} observed peak shifts in photoluminescence for the different phenylalkylammonium lead iodide hybrids. Our results show how the connectivity of the octahedra leads to confinement effects that directly tune the optical band gap...|$|R

5|$|Proteins {{based on}} {{cobalamin}} use corrin {{to hold the}} cobalt. Coenzyme B12 features a reactive C-Co bond that participates in the reactions. In humans, B12 has two types of <b>alkyl</b> ligand: methyl and adenosyl. MeB12 promotes methyl (-CH3) group transfers. The adenosyl version of B12 catalyzes rearrangements in which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or an amine. Methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase (MUT) converts MMl-CoA to Su-CoA, {{an important step in}} the extraction of energy from proteins and fats.|$|E
5|$|The {{differences}} in reduction potentials is attributed in the cobaltocenium {{system to the}} inductive effect of the <b>alkyl</b> groups, further stabilising the 18-valence electron species. A similar effect {{is seen in the}} rhodocenium data shown above, again consistent with inductive effects. In the substituted iridocenium system, cyclic voltammetry investigations shows irreversible reductions at temperatures as low as −60°C; by comparison, the reduction of the corresponding rhodocenes is quasi-reversible at room temperature and fully reversible at −35°C. The irreversibility of the substituted iridocenium reductions is attributed to the extremely rapid dimerisation of the resulting 19-valence electron species, which further illustrates that iridocenes are less stable than their corresponding rhodocenes.|$|E

5|$|Alkanes and aryl alkanes may be {{chlorinated}} under {{free radical}} conditions, with UV light. However, {{the extent of}} chlorination is difficult to control: the reaction is not regioselective and often results {{in a mixture of}} various isomers with different degrees of chlorination, though this may be permissible if the products are easily separated. Aryl chlorides may be prepared by the Friedel-Crafts halogenation, using chlorine and a Lewis acid catalyst. The haloform reaction, using chlorine and sodium hydroxide, is also able to generate <b>alkyl</b> halides from methyl ketones, and related compounds. Chlorine adds to the multiple bonds on alkenes and alkynes as well, giving di- or tetra-chloro compounds. However, due to the expense and reactivity of chlorine, organochlorine compounds are more commonly produced by using hydrogen chloride, or with chlorinating agents such as phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) or thionyl chloride (SOCl2). The last is very convenient in the laboratory because all side products are gaseous and {{do not have to be}} distilled out.|$|E
5|$|Organic mercury {{compounds}} are historically important but are of little industrial {{value in the}} western world. Mercury(II) salts are a rare example of simple metal complexes that react directly with aromatic rings. Organo{{mercury compounds}} are always divalent and usually two-coordinate and linear geometry. Unlike organocadmium and organozinc compounds, organomercury compounds do not react with water. They usually have the formula HgR2, which are often volatile, or HgRX, which are often solids, where R is aryl or <b>alkyl</b> and X is usually halide or acetate. Methylmercury, a generic term for compounds with the formula CH3HgX, is a dangerous family of compounds that are often found in polluted water. They arise by {{a process known as}} biomethylation.|$|E
5|$|Several methods {{exist to}} {{synthesize}} amino acids. One {{of the oldest}} methods begins with the bromination at the α-carbon of a carboxylic acid. Nucleophilic substitution with ammonia then converts the <b>alkyl</b> bromide to the amino acid. In alternative fashion, the Strecker amino acid synthesis involves the treatment of an aldehyde with potassium cyanide and ammonia, this produces an α-amino nitrile as an intermediate. Hydrolysis of the nitrile in acid then yields a α-amino acid. Using ammonia or ammonium salts in this reaction gives unsubstituted amino acids, whereas substituting primary and secondary amines will yield substituted amino acids. Likewise, using ketones, instead of aldehydes, gives α,α-disubstituted amino acids. The classical synthesis gives racemic mixtures of α-amino acids as products, but several alternative procedures using asymmetric auxiliaries or asymmetric catalysts have been developed.|$|E

5|$|The lead analog of the {{simplest}} organic compound, methane, is plumbane. Plumbane may be obtained in a reaction between metallic lead and atomic hydrogen. Two simple derivatives, tetramethyllead and tetraethyllead, are the best-known organolead compounds. These compounds are relatively stable: tetraethyllead only starts to decompose if heated or if exposed to sunlight or ultraviolet light. (Tetraphenyllead is even more thermally stable, decomposing at 270°C.) With sodium metal, lead readily forms an equimolar alloy that reacts with <b>alkyl</b> halides to form organometallic compounds such as tetraethyllead. The oxidizing nature of many organolead compounds is usefully exploited: lead tetraacetate is an important laboratory reagent for oxidation in organic chemistry and tetraethyllead was once produced in larger quantities than any other organometallic compound. Other organolead compounds are less chemically stable. For many organic compounds, a lead analog does not exist.|$|E
25|$|The greater {{stability}} of primary versus secondary <b>alkyl</b> complexes {{can be attributed}} to several factors. First, the primary <b>alkyl</b> complex is favored sterically over the secondary <b>alkyl</b> complex.

25|$|Alkylation {{occurs when}} a {{molecule}} replaces a hydrogen atom with an <b>alkyl</b> group that generally comes from an organic molecule. <b>Alkyl</b> groups that are found naturally occurring in the environment are organometallic compounds.

25|$|The E2 {{mechanism}} {{provides a}} more reliable β-elimination method than E1 for most alkene syntheses. Most E2 eliminations start with an <b>alkyl</b> halide or <b>alkyl</b> sulfonate ester (such as a tosylate or triflate). When an <b>alkyl</b> halide is used, the reaction is called a dehydrohalogenation. For unsymmetrical products, the more substituted alkenes (those with fewer hydrogens attached to the C=C) tend to predominate (see Zaitsev's rule). Two common methods of elimination reactions are dehydrohalogenation of <b>alkyl</b> halides and dehydration of alcohols.

30|$|To {{decrease}} {{the cost of}} the cocatalyst, herein we tested the effects of six relatively inexpensive aluminum <b>alkyls</b> (TMA, TEA, TIBA, TNHA, DEAC, EADC) to partially replace MAO in the PNP/Cr(III)/MAO catalyst system for ethylene oligomerization. We achieved satisfactory catalytic activity and product selectivity when using a system of mixed aluminoxane activators, comprising MAO and various aluminum <b>alkyls</b> as cocatalysts. Amazingly, the application of MAO/DEAC as the cocatalyst resulted in an impressive switch in the selectivity of the PNP/Cr(III) catalytic system—from ethylene tetramerization to ethylene trimerization—as well as high activity. Further research into other mixed aluminoxane systems and their applications in ethylene oligomerization are ongoing.|$|R
