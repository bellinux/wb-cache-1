500|$|Wired writer Nate Ralph {{found that}} [...] "Bloody Fun Day might not feature a deep or even logical narrative, but it's got style in spades, bolstered by simple, fun game mechanics." [...] He {{added that the}} {{increased}} amount of turns needed to hatch eggs [...] "can lead to some delightfully irritating close shaves." [...] IndieGames.com writer Michael Rose agreed, stating [...] "The game mechanics work really well and it's a very nice concept." [...] Anthony Carboni, a former co-host of Attack of the Show! and current presenter of online video game review show Bytejacker, was also positive. In his review he said [...] "It's {{a lot of fun}} and easy to pick up, but as levels progress things do get pretty intense." [...] Zenko stated the game embodied three virtues; [...] "simple, hot and deep". These virtues were required in games published by Electronic Arts, which had been outlined to Zenko in a letter from Electronic Arts' founder Trip Hawkins after Zenko had written to Hawkins as a teenager. During play Zenko's reaper almost died {{due to a lack of}} red souls, but he managed to reverse the situation and fill the life bar; [...] "even after <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> gaming, that rush still does its neurochemical work".|$|E
500|$|The anime {{series has}} been {{compared}} with a similar series that involved gender swapping—Rumiko Takahashi's Ranma ½. In a review at T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews, the reviewer wrote, [...] " [...] rather aggravating to watch at times, but {{seems to have no}} problem raising smiles whenever it wants to, either. The characters, as they are, bring much of the believability of the show, despite the alien elements. It's very much down to earth and pleasant to look at, if nothing else. The rather soft and detailed art style does help, of course, as does the generally great animation quality." [...] The conclusion of the anime was positively reviewed by Erica Friedman, who is the president of Yuricon, an anime convention geared towards fans of yuri anime and manga, and ALC Publishing, a publishing house dedicated to yuri. Friedman described the anime's conclusion as [...] "so normal - so much like a thing that might have actually happened in real life...that it kind of just went under the radar. So - after <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> watching crappy unresolved restart endings we FINALLY get a real ending and it's a yuri ending where the girl remains a girl and get the girl and...thud. Nothing." [...] The anime was given an overall score of 7/10 by Friedman.|$|E

[...] He said, [...] "Then do the part". And I did and I'm very {{grateful}} to him.|$|E

He said he had asked the cabinet what reason he should give the public for abruptly leaving office. [...] "They replied I could use my health as an excuse. To this, I replied that I am not prepared to leave on a lie.

60|$|The borderman sat out {{the long}} vigil {{of the night}} {{watching}} the stars, and trying to decide that love was not for him.

Stern, dark, deadly work must stain and blot all tenderness from his life, else it would be unutterably barren. The joy of living, of unharassed freedom he had always known. If a fair face and dark, mournful eyes were to haunt him on every lonely trail, then it were better an Indian should end his existence.|$|R

5000|$|In June 2011, former Democratic presidential {{candidate}} George McGovern {{spoke out against}} the travel ban before visiting Cuba, remarking: [...] "It's a stupid policy.
