5|$|In 1940, Thurman {{founded the}} Aframerican Women’s Journal, the first {{publishing}} vehicle of the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW), which she edited from 1940 until 1944. In 1941, an archive committee {{was formed to}} design a plan for collecting works about the achievements of African-American women. Though their plans focused primarily on written records and professional <b>accomplishment</b> <b>and</b> would thus reflect middle-class life, the committee initiated work on collecting historical records of black women. In 1944, Thurman became the committee's chair and her mother donated $1,000 toward creating the National Council of Negro Women's National Library, Archives, and Museum. On June 30, 1946, they held an archive drive, printing notices in newsletters and asking ministers, organizations, librarians and others to help them acquire photographs, books and mementos. They opened the first facility of the library at {{what is now the}} Mary McLeod Bethune Council House National Historic Site.|$|E

5|$|The game's design also {{received}} acclaim. Carter from Destructoid {{thought that the}} fortress and the outpost system provided players {{with a sense of}} <b>accomplishment</b> <b>and</b> success, and he considered having the freedom to use different ways to approach and complete missions one of the greatest parts of the game. In addition, Carter applauded the game's driving mechanics and the auto-drive feature, which he considered a significant improvement for the series. However he criticized the upgrade system, which he thought was directly converted from Far Cry 3 and was uninspiring. Electronic Gaming Monthlys Harmon thought that the introduction of the helicopter was dull. Mitch Dyer, from IGN, praised the game's economy system, which he thought was satisfying. He added that it gives players motivations to complete side-quests. Justin McElroy of Polygon praised the introduction of the grappling hook and the vertical map-design, which he thought had allowed players to develop strategy before taking action. He also praised the game for allowing players to use multiple approaches towards a single objective.|$|E

25|$|While {{attending}} undergraduate {{school in}} Rochester, New York, in 1839, classmates Clarke and Morton apparently participated in ether frolics with some regularity. In January 1842, by now {{a medical student}} at Berkshire Medical College, Clarke administered ether to a Miss Hobbie, while Elijah Pope performed a dental extraction. In so doing, {{he became the first}} to administer an inhaled anesthetic to facilitate the performance of a surgical procedure. Clarke apparently thought little of his <b>accomplishment,</b> <b>and</b> chose neither to publish nor to pursue this technique any further. Indeed, this event is not even mentioned in Clarke's biography.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of his {{determination}} to accomplish great victories Haig too often disregarded key factors such as weather, and the condition of the battlefield, placed his objectives beyond the range which his artillery could cover and incorporated in his schemes a role for cavalry which this arm was helpless to accomplish. These shortcomings, it needs to be stressed, were not at all peculiar to Haig.... But the outcome, too often, was British operations directed towards unrealizable objectives and persisted in long after they had ceased to serve any worthwhile purpose. The consequence was excessive loss of British lives, insubstantial <b>accomplishment,</b> <b>and</b> waning morale.|$|E

25|$|Qi (or chi) {{is often}} {{translated}} as life energy, referring to energy circulating through the body; though {{a more general}} definition is universal energy, including heat, light, and electromagnetic energy; and definitions often involve breath, air, gas, or relationship between matter, energy, and spirit. Qi is the central underlying principle in traditional Chinese medicine and martial arts. Gong (or kung) is often translated as cultivation or work, and definitions include practice, skill, mastery, merit, achievement, service, result, or <b>accomplishment,</b> <b>and</b> {{is often used to}} mean gongfu (kung fu) in the traditional sense of achievement through great effort.

25|$|Kermit High School was {{established}} in 1928 as a public secondary school that offered classes in most fields of study. This first school had seven staff members and an enrollment of 115. The school initially only fielded three sports teams, girls basketball coached by Superintendent B.F. Meek, boys basketball coached by R.M. Cook, and a football team also coached by R.M. Cook. However, the football team did not actually compete until 1931 {{due to lack of}} essential materials. Shortly afterward in 1932, the school added tennis to its sports program. In 1934, Mr. Tommy Thompson came to Kermit as principal and coach along with many other staff members. Tommy Thompson would later serve as Superintendent of the district from 1948 to 1975 with much success, <b>accomplishment,</b> <b>and</b> an excellent reputation with statewide recognition as an outstanding administrator. Today, Kermit High School is organized into 20 departments/units, with a strong emphasis on science, math, social studies, and language arts. It is also well recognized for its extra-curricular organizations such as athletics and sports, band, choir, theater, and an active student council.|$|E

25|$|Promoting {{independence}} in self-care can provide {{older adults with}} the capability to maintain independence longer and can leave them {{with a sense of}} achievement when they complete a task unaided. Older adults that require assistance with activities of daily living are at a greater risk of losing their independence with self-care tasks as dependent personal behaviours are often met with reinforcement from caregivers. It is important for caregivers to ensure that measures are put into place to preserve and promote function rather than contribute to a decline in status in an older adult that has physical limitations. Caregivers need to be conscious of actions and behaviors that cause older adults to become dependent on them and need to allow older patients to maintain as much independence as possible. Providing information to the older patient on why it is important to perform self-care may allow them to see the benefit in performing self-care independently. If the older adult is able to complete self-care activities on their own, or even if they need supervision, encourage them in their efforts as maintaining independence can provide them with a sense of <b>accomplishment</b> <b>and</b> the ability to maintain independence longer.|$|E
500|$|The museum {{opened on}} 10 August 1793, {{the first anniversary}} of the monarchy's demise. The public was given free access on three days per week, which was [...] "perceived as a major <b>accomplishment</b> <b>and</b> was {{generally}} appreciated". The collection showcased 537paintings and 184objects of art. Three quarters were derived from the royal collections, the remainder from confiscated émigrés and Church property (biens nationaux). To expand and organize the collection, the Republic dedicated 100,000livres per year. In 1794, France's revolutionary armies began bringing pieces from Northern Europe, augmented after the Treaty of Tolentino (1797) by works from the Vatican, such as Laocoön and His Sons and the Apollo Belvedere, to establish the Louvre as a museum and as a [...] "sign of popular sovereignty".|$|E

500|$|Chaplin {{finished}} editing City Lights in December 1930, {{by which}} time silent films were an anachronism. A preview before an unsuspecting public audience was not a success, but a showing for the press produced positive reviews. One journalist wrote, [...] "Nobody {{in the world but}} Charlie Chaplin could have done it. He is the only person that has that peculiar something called 'audience appeal' in sufficient quality to defy the popular penchant for movies that talk." [...] Given its general release in January 1931, City Lights proved to be a popular and financial success – eventually grossing over $3 million. The British Film Institute cites it as Chaplin's finest <b>accomplishment,</b> <b>and</b> the critic James Agee hails the closing scene as [...] "the greatest piece of acting and the highest moment in movies". City Lights became Chaplin's personal favourite of his films and remained so throughout his life.|$|E
500|$|Van Alen's {{satisfaction}} in these accomplishments was likely muted by Walter Chrysler's later {{refusal to pay}} the balance of his architectural fee. Chrysler alleged that Van Alen had received bribes from suppliers, and Van Alen had not signed any contracts with Walter Chrysler {{when he took over}} the project. Van Alen sued and the courts ruled in his favor, requiring Chrysler to pay Van Allen $840,000, or 6% of the total budget of the building. However, the lawsuit against Chrysler markedly diminished Van Alen's reputation as an architect, which, along with the effects of the Great Depression and negative criticism, ended up ruining his career. Van Alen ended his career as professor of sculpture at the nearby Beaux-Arts Institute of Design and died in 1954. According to author Neal Bascomb, [...] "The Chrysler Building was his greatest <b>accomplishment,</b> <b>and</b> the one that guaranteed his obscurity." ...|$|E
500|$|Rupert first {{travelled}} to the Royal {{court in}} exile at St Germain but found it still {{dominated by the}} Queen and her favourite, Rupert's enemy Digby. Instead, Rupert moved on, accepting a well paid commission from Anne of Austria to serve Louis XIV as a mareschal de camp, subject to Rupert being free to leave French service to fight for King Charles, should he {{be called upon to}} do so. In 1647 Rupert fought under Marshal de Gassion against the Spanish. After a three-week siege, Rupert took the powerful fortress of La Bassée through quiet negotiations with the enemy commander—an impressive <b>accomplishment,</b> <b>and</b> one that won him favour in French court circles. Gassion and Rupert were ambushed shortly afterwards by a Spanish party; during the resulting fight, Rupert {{was shot in the head}} and seriously injured. Afterwards, Gassion noted: [...] "Monsieur, I am most annoyed that you are wounded." [...] "And me also," [...] Rupert is recorded as replying. Gassion was himself killed shortly afterwards, and Rupert returned to St Germain to recuperate.|$|E
