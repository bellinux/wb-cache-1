50|$|The variety lilacina {{is similar}} in shape but tinted lilac all over, with an ochre-brown flush on the cap umbo and {{the base of the}} stem. It has a strong mealy or earthy odour. This variety could be mistaken for the edible <b>amethyst</b> <b>deceiver</b> (Laccaria amethystina), {{although}} the latter species has a fibrous stipe, a fruity smell and lacks the ochre-coloured umbo. It is a similar coloration to the wood blewit, although mushrooms of that species generally grow much larger.|$|E
5000|$|Laccaria amethystina, {{commonly}} known as the <b>amethyst</b> <b>deceiver,</b> is a small brightly colored mushroom, that grows in deciduous as well as coniferous forests. The mushroom itself is edible, but can absorb arsenic from the soil. Because its bright amethyst coloration fades with age and weathering, it becomes difficult to identify, hence the common name ‘Deceiver’. This common name is shared with its close relation Laccaria laccata that also fades and weathers. It is found mainly in Northern temperate zones, though it is reported to occur in tropical Central and South America as well. Recently, some of the other species in the genus have been given the common name of [...] "deceiver".|$|E
5000|$|Laccaria is a genus around 75 {{species of}} fungus found in both {{temperate}} and tropical {{regions of the}} world. They are mycorrhizal. The type species is Laccaria laccata, {{commonly known as the}} deceiver. Other notable species include L. bicolor, and the <b>amethyst</b> <b>deceiver</b> (L. amethystina), sometimes incorrectly written as L. amethystea. Because some Laccaria species have the ability to grow vegetatively and/or germinate from basidiospores in culture, they are often used as experimental systems for studies of ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes. They have a [...] "tetrapolar mating system", meaning that there are 4 mating types, any two of which can fertilize each other. Recently, the genome of L. bicolor has been sequenced.|$|E

50|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} in 1778 by well-known English botanist and apothecary William Hudson as Agaricus amethystinus, and later {{put into the}} genus Laccaria by Mordecai Cubitt Cooke. The <b>amethyst</b> <b>deceiver</b> has had many binomials over a great many years, but reference to the amethyst coloration is featured in most of these. It was once placed in the genus Collybia, as Collybia amethystina, which was probably {{due in part to}} its tough collybioid-like stem. Its present binomial places it in the genus Laccaria, with the specific epithet amethystina, a pairing first used by Cooke in 1884. In 1922 it was named as a variant of Laccaria laccata, Laccaria laccata var. amethystina (Cooke) Rea, which is now a synonym.|$|E
50|$|The {{reservoirs}} {{are surrounded}} by the Wyming Brook Nature Reserve {{which is part of}} the Eastern Peak District Moors Site of Special Scientific Interest. Wildlife in the reserve includes northern spinach and common lutestring moths as well as a host of birds both on and off the water. These include crossbill, white-throated dipper, mallard, coot, moorhen and grey heron; occasional visitors include cormorant, Canada goose and osprey. The flora around the reservoirs consist mostly of deciduous and evergreen woodland; in autumn many species of fungi are on display including Jew‘s ear, plums and custard and <b>amethyst</b> <b>deceiver.</b> In recent years Yorkshire Water have conducted trials on releasing different volumes of water from the Lower reservoir and monitoring the effects on the River Rivelin. This has resulted in being able to create better conditions for brown trout spawning and an increase in the population of bullhead.|$|E

5000|$|Rosa Mundi was {{the name}} of a very short lived {{electronic}} music supergroup which consisted of Rose McDowall, John Balance and possibly Peter Christopherson. The group is only credited for one song, [...] "The Snow Man" [...] which appeared on the compilations The Final Solstice and The Final Solstice II and the split 7" [...] vinyl Grief. Furthermore, Rosa Mundi is credited on the song [...] "Christmas Is Now Drawing Near" [...] from the Coil single Winter Solstice: North, later released on Moons Milk (In Four Phases). Since both songs, [...] "The Snow Man" [...] and [...] "Christmas Is Now Drawing Near", were both originally released in 1999, {{it can be said that}} this is the only year the group functioned. However, the song [...] "Rosa Decidua" [...] from the 1998 Coil EP Autumn Equinox: <b>Amethyst</b> <b>Deceivers,</b> while not credited to Rosa Mundi, has exactly the same line-up.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the wave}} of {{experimental}} side projects, Coil's sound was completely redefined. Before releasing new material, the group released the compilations Unnatural History II, Windowpane & The Snow and Unnatural History III. In March 1998, Coil began to release a series of four singles which were timed {{to coincide with the}} equinox and solstices of that year. The singles are characterized by slow, drone-like instrumental rhythms, and electronic or orchestral instrumentation. The first single, Spring Equinox: Moon's Milk or Under an Unquiet Skull, featured two versions of the same song, the second version of which included an electric viola contribution from a newly inducted member, William Breeze. The second single, Summer Solstice: Bee Stings, also featured performances by Breeze, and also included the industrial-noise song [...] "A Warning from the Sun (For Fritz)", which was dedicated to a friend of Balance and Christopherson's who had committed suicide earlier that year. The third single, Autumn Equinox: <b>Amethyst</b> <b>Deceivers</b> includes the track [...] "Rosa Decidua", which features vocals by Rose McDowall. The single also features the song [...] "Amethyst Deceivers", later reworked and performed throughout most of Coil's tour—it was eventually re-made into an alternate version on the LP The Ape of Naples. The fourth single, Winter Solstice: North, also includes a track sung by McDowall, and is partially credited to the side project Rosa Mundi. The series would later be re-released as the double-CD set, Moon's Milk (In Four Phases).|$|R
