His inaugural address in November 1868 suggested that the various regional mining institutions should amalgamate to increase appreciation of the profession and to affiliate with the Institution of Civil Engineers to improve professional recognition. He was also a member of other professional engineering institutions and unlike some owners he supported the establishment of the Mines Inspectorate in the 1850s. He appeared as an expert witness before several government inquiries, and served on the Royal Commission on the coal industry that reported in 1871 and the Royal Commission on Accidents in Mines that reported in 1886.|$|E
40|$|Disallowed gas {{concentration}} (DGC), i. e., a cease in production due to {{gas concentration}} exceeding the allowable limits, occurs frequently {{during the initial}} mining phase of longwall faces in Yangquan Coalfield, and seriously affects safety. The mechanism of DGC during the initial mining phase of longwall face is determined by analyzing the outflow behavior of methane. The results show that mining can induce ground movement and lead to pressure relief, leading to desorption and migration of the gas in the <b>adjacent</b> <b>seams.</b> Gas drainage from the high-level gas drainage roadway is unsuccessful because it is normally located too high to connect to vertical broken crevices of overlying strata {{in a timely manner}} during the initial mining phase, subsequently, the released methane from <b>adjacent</b> <b>seams</b> flows into the goaf. This results in the occurrence of DGC at the longwall face. Thus, based on the analysis of overlying strata movement and the flow characteristics of gas from <b>adjacent</b> <b>seams,</b> we propose an <b>adjacent</b> <b>seams</b> gas drainage technique of a large-diameter blind shaft joined to the high-level gas drainage roadway (LDBS-HGDR) for the initial mining phase. A computational fluid dynamics simulation was conducted to obtain the optimal design of the layout parameters for the LDBS-HGDR at Panel 15201. Compared with the conventional rear high-level gas drainage roadway technique, the gas drainage technique of the LDBS-HGDR is advantageous in terms of ease of construction, low cost, and sufficiently long drainage hours. Moreover, the outflow of gas from <b>adjacent</b> <b>seams</b> can be effectively decreased with this technique, thereby eliminating the hazards originating from the frequent occurrence of DGC...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the methods {{which can be}} used to determine the in-situ stresses in sedimentary strata including coals. It also examines the changes in effective stresses brought about by fluid withdrawal such as that caused by gas and water drainage. These changes in effective stress are brought about directly by changing fluid pressure and, in the case of coals, by the effects of shrinkage as the coal releases gas and if it dries out. As the permeability of coal is very significantly affected by its effective stress the drainage of coals is dependent on the state of effective stress. Coal permeability may either increase or decrease during drainage. Permeability frequently shows some initial decline as fluid pressure decreases before shrinkage effects cause an increase. In some cases though, the overall trend is for a continuing decline in permeability. Under these circumstances no amount of stimulation to induce drainage will work and some other means must be sought to de-stress the coal. This has typically been by working an <b>adjacent</b> <b>seam</b> which is more amenable to being mined...|$|R

40|$|The Bureau of Mines has {{developed}} a unique new mine design procedure to determine the changing static load distributions imposed on under-ground support structures during the mining cycle. The procedure reduces the complexities associated with analyzing a three-dimensional problem. A combination of the multiple-seam displacement-discontinuity model and a two-dimensional finite-element window model produces refined results for a specific area of interest by assuming displacement compat-ibility between models. Input to the procedure includes the geometry of mined-out areas in up to two <b>adjacent</b> <b>seams,</b> the rock mass characteris-tics of the surrounding geology, the in situ stress conditions, and the mining sequence. The displacement-discontinuity program calculates ex-pected loadings for mine structures affected by the mining cycle and/or by overlying or underlying seams.

Separations between panels of 200 - 450 mm, and in one case of 1200 mm, have been reported.

Exhumation of six mid-slope locations in the field indicated that there was no opening of the panel over-laps at the heat-tacked seams after more than 60 days exposure. This paper reports the results of a laboratory pan shrinkage test as well as tensile tests on seams prepared at this field site. The shrinkage test generated a maximum shrinkage of about 17 % in the GCL adjacent to the heat-tacked seam after 40 wet-dry cycles. The same wet-dry cycles generated a tensile stress in the seam corresponding to a 13 % tensile strain in the GCL <b>adjacent</b> to the <b>seam.</b> The heat-tacked seam readily withstood this tensile force.

40|$|A thin {{coal seam}} mined as a {{protective}} coal seam above a gas outburst coal seam plays {{a central role}} in decreasing the degree of stress placed on a protected seam, thus increasing gas permeability levels and desorption capacities to dramatically eliminate gas outburst risk for the protected seam. However, when multiple layers of coal seams are present, stress-relieved gas from <b>adjacent</b> coal <b>seams</b> can cause a gas explosion.

Evaluation of glove damage found that the outer Vectran fibers were sliced {{as a result of}} contact with a sharp edge or pinch point rather than general wear or abrasion (commonly observed on the RTV pads). Damage to gloves was also noted on STS- 118 and STS- 120. One potential source of EMU glove damages are sharp crater lips on external handrails, generated by micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) impacts. In this paper, the results of a hypervelocity impact (HVI) test program on representative and actual ISS handrails are presented. These tests were performed in order to characterize impact damage profiles on ISS handrails and evaluate alternatives for limiting risk to future missions. It was determined that both penetrating and non-penetrating MMOD impacts on aluminum and steel ISS handrails are capable of generating protruding crater profiles which exceed the heights required for EMU glove abrasion risk by an order of magnitude. Testing demonstrated that flexible overwraps attached to the outside of existing handrails are capable of limiting contact between hazardous crater formations and crewmember gloves during extravehicular activity (EVA).

Der sogenannte „Referenzprozess“ macht dazu Veränderungen der Intensität bzw. der Intensitätsverteilung auf dem Werkstück sichtbar, die zu unterschiedlichen Schweißergebnissen führen und sich mittels Messschieber einfach auswerten lassen. Ein weiterer Vorteil der hohen Intensitäten von im infraroten emittierenden Laser-strahlquellen ist die Bearbeitung von Kupferwerkstoffen im Dauerstrichbetrieb. Dabei lassen sich mehrere Millimeter Einschweißtiefe erreichen. Eine Herausforderung stellt die geringe Absorption von gerade einmal 5 % zu Prozessbeginn dar. Starke Rückreflexe können dabei zu Schädigungen in den optischen Komponenten führen. Durch die Verwendung von frequenzverdoppelten Lasersystemen kann die Absorption etwa versiebenfacht werden, so dass Rückreflexe reduziert werden. Diese neuartigen im „grünen“ emittierenden cw-Laser sind in ihrer Leistung noch stark begrenzt, weshalb in dieser Arbeit ein Kombinationsprozess realisiert wurde, mit dem höhere Einschweißtiefen möglich werden und der Vorteil der kürzeren Wellenlänge deutlich wird. New {{developments}} in diode-pumped fibre lasers and disc lasers open up opportunities for completely new process strategies {{as a result}} of their incomparable focusability at high laser power. This yields unprecedented beam parameter quotients (power divided by focus diameter) which are needed for high welding velocities. In addition this allows deep penetration welding in highly reflective materials such as copper. The laser sources used for this work were fibre coupled allowing high accessibility and flexibility as well as lower costs for the handling devices. Another important property of shorter wavelengths is the generally increased absorptivity in metals. With the use of 1 µm lasers instead of CO 2 lasers, an increase of absorptivity has already been attained. A further improvement of the absorptivity, especially in copper material, can be achieved by using laser sources in the visible range. This kind of novel laser sources, which have not been available so far, goes along with new possibilities in material processing. For industrial application the above mentioned advantages can be exploited in high efficiency processes. The small interaction zones enable deep penetration welding with less distortion of the workpiece. The joint geometries of thin samples of less than one millimeter have never been achievable before and were therefore never examined in the past. The minimization of distortion through minimizing the heat input is clearly shown in this work. For this purpose samples of stainless steel with a thickness of 500 µm were used. The distortion angle (averaged angle of the distorted workpiece <b>adjacent</b> the weld <b>seam)</b> was measured with a surface topography system. Therewith a comparison of different welding parameters could be performed. Three laser sources with different beam qualities were used for the investigations. Different focal diameters in the range from 14 µm to 200 µm were achieved with different focusing arrangements. A reduction of the distortion angle was demonstrated for: Smaller focus diameter; Higher processing speeds (up to 50 m/min); Smaller divergence angle of the laser beam. In doing so the penetration depth of welds was kept constant. The above mentioned three parameters directly reduced the cross-sectional area of the weld seam and therefore resulted in a smaller distortion angle. Due to the decreasing focal diameters new clamping devices with a high position accuracy had to be developed. A magnetic clamping device fulfilling this demand was constructed and manufactured. However, high average power very often causes thermal beam distortion inside trans-mitting optical elements. This effect is especially pronounced in contaminated optics. It results in a significant decrease of the beam quality and a shortening of the effective focal length, also referred to as focus shift. Both effects directly modify the laser spot size and thus the intensity on the workpiece. This is very critical for most laser material processing applications. Especially welding of highly reflective materials such as copper is very sensitive to changes in the laser intensity. To prevent process failures, the focus shift and also the beam quality have to be measured behind the optical components. Static as well as transient measurements showed that the focus shift and the degraded beam quality directly reduce the intensity on the workpiece. In addition the power which is absorbed, reflected, and scattered in the optical components also reduces the intensity on the workpiece. Reductions of the intensity on the workpiece of up to 88 % were measured. The remaining 12 % obviously are not sufficient to allow a stable welding process. These results imply that the use of appropriate and very clean processing optics is mandatory for a reproducible and stable welding process. The above mentioned measurements require very expensive and complex measure-ment equipment. In this work, a novel and simple method is presented, which uses the welding process itself to quantitatively determine the focus shift. The so-called “reference process” was developed, which takes benefit of the dependence of the deep penetration welding threshold on the beam diameter. After a defined preheating time in order to control the thermal load of the optics, a weld trace of a few centimeters is generated in a sample by applying a laser power ramp. The position of the transition from heat conduction welding to deep penetration welding is easily noticeable by visual inspection of the seam width on the workpiece surface. This allows measuring it with a simple caliper, yielding the threshold transition power. By the outcome of four different welds with suitably varying laser parameters, the focus shift can be calculated with appropriate accuracy. With this method, a new and easily applicable tool is available. This is an important requirement for a reproducible and stable welding process and even holds for changing conditions, as e. g. slowly contaminated safety glasses. Presuming correct conditions of the laser beam on the workpiece, also highly reflec-tive materials can be welded by the means of highly brilliant 1 µm laser beams. With the use of 1 µm lasers the absorptivity can be increased from about 1 % to about 5 % in copper material at room temperature as compared to CO 2 -lasers. Using high-power 1 µm lasers this absorptivity increase guarantees that enough energy absorbed for starting a deep penetration welding process. In addition the absorptivity of copper increases with temperature and even shows a large step in absorptivity at the phase transition from solid to liquid from about 8 % to about 13 %. When the processing optics are not aligned and shielded correctly, the large amount of back reflected laser light causes severe damage somewhere in the optics chain. This happens especially at the process start. To control the process start condition, the absorptivity was increased by coupling more laser power in the copper material. This was done by using a beam source with a once more shorter wavelength. A frequency-doubled thin-disk laser with a wavelength of 515 nm and a maximum average output power of 100 W was available for the experiments presented here. At this wavelength, the absorptivity for the “cold” copper material is more than seven times higher as compared to the infrared (IR) laser beam. However, due to the limited power the penetration depth of pure copper welds was only about 100 µm, which is not sufficient for most industrial applications. Therefore, a commercial thin-disk laser (&# 955; = 1030 nm) and the frequency doubled thin-disk laser were combined allowing a so-called hybrid process. The preceding green laser beam with a focal diameter of 25 µm was used to heat up, melting and forming a small keyhole on the surface of the copper material. The IR laser beam was focused onto the workpiece to a diameter of 100 µm and the distance between the two laser beams was adjusted to 100 µm. The large distance was chosen so that there was no interaction between the keyhole created by the green laser beam and the interaction region of the IR beam. Numerical simulation of these conditions showed an increase of absorptivity in the interaction zone of the IR beam from 5 % to about 11 %. Under these conditions the IR beam interacted with the preheated material which leads to an enhanced absorptivity and a lower threshold for deep penetration welding. Welding experiments confirmed the predictions. For the described hybrid process two laser sources as well as two very accurately aligned processing heads were necessary. The high complexity of the optical arrange-ment and the resulting high cost make the hybrid process only reasonable for specific industrial applications. Nevertheless, the encouraging results using the hybrid process suggest further research on laser sources providing - at least at the process start - enough “green” laser power to force well-controlled deep penetration welding in copper materials...|$|R
