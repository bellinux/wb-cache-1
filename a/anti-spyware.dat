25|$|<b>Anti-spyware</b> {{software}} {{programs can be}} used solely for detection and removal of spyware software {{that has already been}} installed into the computer. This kind of <b>anti-spyware</b> can often be set to scan on a regular schedule.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anti-spyware</b> {{programs}} often report Web advertisers' HTTP cookies, {{the small}} text files that track browsing activity, as spyware. While {{they are not}} always inherently malicious, many users object to third parties using space on their personal computers for their business purposes, and many <b>anti-spyware</b> programs offer to remove them.|$|E
25|$|If a spyware {{program is}} not blocked and manages to get itself installed, it may resist {{attempts}} to terminate or uninstall it. Some programs work in pairs: when an <b>anti-spyware</b> scanner (or the user) terminates one running process, the other one respawns the killed program. Likewise, some spyware will detect attempts to remove registry keys and immediately add them again. Usually, booting the infected computer in safe mode allows an <b>anti-spyware</b> program {{a better chance of}} removing persistent spyware. Killing the process tree may also work.|$|E
25|$|WSC in Windows Vista {{monitors}} new criteria, such as <b>anti-spyware</b> software, User Account Control, and Internet Explorer security settings. It {{can also}} display logos of third-party products {{that have been}} registered with the Security Center.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, it {{may also}} {{intercept}} attempts to install start-up items or to modify browser settings. Earlier versions of <b>anti-spyware</b> programs focused chiefly on detection and removal. Javacool Software's SpywareBlaster, {{one of the first}} to offer real-time protection, blocked the installation of ActiveX-based spyware.|$|E
25|$|Malicious programmers have {{released}} {{a large number}} of rogue (fake) <b>anti-spyware</b> programs, and widely distributed Web banner ads can warn users that their computers have been infected with spyware, directing them to purchase programs which do not actually remove spywareâ€”or else, may add more spyware of their own.|$|E
25|$|Real-time protection, on-access scanning, {{background}} guard, resident shield, autoprotect, {{and other}} synonyms {{refer to the}} automatic protection provided by most antivirus, <b>anti-spyware,</b> and other anti-malware programs. This monitors computer systems for suspicious activity such as computer viruses, spyware, adware, and other malicious objects in 'real-time', in other words while data loaded into the computer's active memory: when inserting a CD, opening an email, or browsing the web, or when a file already on the computer is opened or executed.|$|E
25|$|A WMI {{provider}} {{makes the}} settings {{available to the}} system. Third-party anti-virus, <b>anti-spyware</b> and personal firewall software vendors primarily register with Security and Maintenance through the WMI provider. Windows Vista added {{a new set of}} API that let programs retrieve the aggregate health status within Security and Maintenance, and to receive notifications when the health status changes. These APIs allow programs to confirm that the system is in a healthy state before engaging in certain actions. For example, a computer game can ensure that a firewall is running before connecting to an online game.|$|E
25|$|Among other positions, Edwards was {{generally}} pro-choice and supported {{affirmative action and}} the death penalty. One of his first sponsored bills was the Fragile X Research Breakthrough Act of 1999. He {{was also the first}} person to introduce comprehensive <b>anti-spyware</b> legislation with the Spyware Control and Privacy Protection Act. He advocated rolling back the Bush administration's tax cuts and ending mandatory minimum sentencing for non-violent offenders. Edwards generally supported expanding legal immigration to the United States while working with Mexico to provide better border security and stop illegal trafficking.|$|E
25|$|Security and Maintenance (formerly Action Center {{and before}} that, Security Center) is a {{monitoring}} {{component of the}} Windows NT family of operating system. It monitors the security and maintenance status of the computer. Its monitoring criteria includes optimal operation of personal firewalls, anti-virus software and <b>anti-spyware</b> software, {{as well as the}} working status of Network Access Protection, Windows Update, User Account Control, Windows Error Reporting and Backup and Restore. It notifies the user of any problem with the monitored criteria, e.g. when an antivirus program is not up-to-date or is offline.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, {{three new}} {{products}} were introduced for {{small and medium-sized}} businesses (SMBs) with 50, 100 or 250 users in bundles with Websense and Secure Computing. This was followed by a second generation of the ProxySG product family, which added security features for instant messaging. A review in eWeek said the new ProxySG line was effective and easy to deploy, but the ongoing maintenance fees were expensive. In 2005 Blue Coat announced an <b>anti-spyware</b> appliance called Spyware Interceptor and the following year it announced upcoming WAN optimization products. This was followed by SSL-VPN security appliances to secure remote connections.|$|E
25|$|A study {{conducted}} by Kevin Mitnick and marketing communications firm Avantgarde in 2004, found that an unprotected and unpatched Windows XP system with Service Pack 1 lasted only four minutes on the Internet before it was compromised, and an unprotected and also unpatched Windows Server 2003 system was compromised after being {{connected to the internet}} for 8 hours. The computer that was running Windows XP Service Pack 2 was not compromised. The AOL National Cyber Security Alliance Online Safety Study of October 2004, determined that 80% of Windows users were infected by at least one spyware/adware product. Much documentation is available describing how to increase the security of Microsoft Windows products. Typical suggestions include deploying Microsoft Windows behind a hardware or software firewall, running anti-virus and <b>anti-spyware</b> software, and installing patches as they become available through Windows Update.|$|E
500|$|Media {{coverage}} {{as early}} as January 2006 recounted consumer complaints and mentioned that several <b>anti-spyware</b> companies were buying Google advertisements boasting their product's ability to [...] "Remove Movieland Now". [...] In a report updated February 20, 2008, the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School calls Movieland's MediaPipe component [...] "badware" [...] because [...] "it does not fully disclose what it is installing, does not completely remove all components and 'obligations' during the uninstall process, and modifies other software without disclosure." [...] Richard Stiennon of IT-Harvest referred to Movieland {{as a form of}} [...] "Ransomware" [...] due to its behaviour. As of July 2008, the MediaPipe report is still cited by the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School.|$|E
2500|$|Major {{anti-virus}} {{firms such}} as Symantec, PC Tools, McAfee and Sophos have also added <b>anti-spyware</b> features to their existing anti-virus products. [...] Early on, anti-virus firms expressed reluctance to add <b>anti-spyware</b> functions, citing lawsuits brought by spyware authors against the authors of web sites and programs which described their products as [...] "spyware". However, recent versions of these major firms' home and business anti-virus products do include <b>anti-spyware</b> functions, albeit treated differently from viruses. Symantec Anti-Virus, for instance, categorizes spyware programs as [...] "extended threats" [...] and now offers real-time protection against these threats.|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes, spyware is {{included}} along with genuine software, and {{may come from}} a malicious website or may {{have been added to}} the intentional functionality of genuine software (see the paragraph about Facebook, below). [...] In response to the emergence of spyware, a small industry has sprung up dealing in <b>anti-spyware</b> software. Running <b>anti-spyware</b> software has become a widely recognized element of computer security practices, especially for computers running Microsoft Windows. A number of jurisdictions have passed <b>anti-spyware</b> laws, which usually target any software that is surreptitiously installed to control a user's computer.|$|E
2500|$|Co-founded the Congressional Privacy Caucus, cosponsor of the <b>anti-spyware</b> SPY ACT, {{initiated}} [...]|$|E
2500|$|Like most {{anti-virus}} software, many anti-spyware/adware tools {{require a}} frequently updated database of threats. As new spyware programs are released, <b>anti-spyware</b> developers discover and evaluate them, {{adding to the}} list of known spyware, which allows the software to detect and remove new spyware. As a result, <b>anti-spyware</b> software is of limited usefulness without regular updates. [...] Updates may be installed automatically or manually.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Anti-spyware</b> {{applications}} {{are able to}} detect many keyloggers and cleanse them. Responsible vendors of monitoring software support detection by <b>anti-spyware</b> programs, thus preventing abuse of the software. Enabling a firewall does not stop keyloggers per se, but can possibly prevent transmission of the logged material over the net if properly configured. Network monitors (also known as reverse-firewalls) {{can be used to}} alert the user whenever an application attempts to make a network connection. This gives the user the chance to prevent the keylogger from [...] "phoning home" [...] with his or her typed information. Automatic form-filling programs can prevent keylogging entirely by not using the keyboard at all. Most keyloggers can be fooled by alternating between typing the login credentials and typing characters somewhere else in the focus window.|$|E
2500|$|An <b>anti-spyware</b> {{tool that}} uses the Windows Defender engine as a core to protect against {{potentially}} unwanted software (In version 1.0, this required the separate installation of Windows Defender and was not integrated into the OneCare interface, although it could be managed and launched from OneCare. Version 1.5 integrated the Windows Defender engine into OneCare and no longer requires separate installation.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] {{proliferation}} of fake or spoofed antivirus products that bill themselves as antispyware can be troublesome. [...] Users may receive popups prompting them to install them {{to protect their}} computer, when it will in fact add spyware. [...] This software is called rogue software. [...] It is recommended that users do not install any freeware claiming to be <b>anti-spyware</b> unless it is verified to be legitimate. Some known offenders include: ...|$|E
2500|$|To detect spyware, {{computer}} users have found several practices useful {{in addition to}} installing <b>anti-spyware</b> programs. [...] Many users have installed a web browser other than Internet Explorer, such as Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome. Though no browser is completely safe, Internet Explorer was once at a greater risk for spyware infection due to its large user base as well as vulnerabilities such as ActiveX but these three major browsers are now close to equivalent {{when it comes to}} security.|$|E
2500|$|Litigation {{has gone}} both ways. Since [...] "spyware" [...] {{has become a}} common pejorative, some makers have filed libel and {{defamation}} actions when their products have been so described. In 2003, Gator (now known as Claria) filed suit against the website PC Pitstop for describing its program as [...] "spyware". PC Pitstop settled, agreeing {{not to use the}} word [...] "spyware", but continues to describe harm caused by the Gator/Claria software. As a result, other <b>anti-spyware</b> and anti-virus companies have also used other terms such as [...] "potentially unwanted programs" [...] or greyware to denote these products.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, {{along with}} the launch of AOL 9.0 Optimized, AOL also made {{available}} the option of personalized greetings which would enable the user to hear his or her name while accessing basic functions and mail alerts, or while logging in or out. In 2005, AOL broadcast the Live 8 concert live over the Internet, and thousands of users downloaded clips of the concert over the following months. [...] In late 2005, AOL released AOL Safety & Security Center, a bundle of McAfee Antivirus, CA <b>anti-spyware,</b> and proprietary firewall and phishing protection software. [...] News reports in late 2005 identified companies such as Yahoo!, Microsoft, and Google as candidates for turning AOL into a joint venture. Those plans were abandoned when it was revealed on December 20, 2005 that Google would purchase a 5% share of AOL for $1billion.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2010, Google {{detected}} a [...] "highly sophisticated" [...] cyber-attack on its infrastructure that originated from China. The {{targets of the}} attack were Chinese human rights activists, but Google discovered that accounts belonging to European, American and Chinese activists for human rights in China had been [...] "routinely accessed by third parties". Additionally, Google stated that their investigation revealed that [...] "at least" [...] 20 other large companies from a [...] "wide range of businesses" [...] - including the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical sectors - had been similarly targeted. Google {{was in the process}} of notifying those companies and it was also working with relevant US authorities. In light of the attacks, Google enhanced the security and architecture of its infrastructure, and advised individual users to install anti-virus and <b>anti-spyware</b> on their computers, update their operating systems and web browsers, and be cautious when clicking on Internet links or when sharing personal information in instant messages and emails.|$|E
50|$|No {{software-based}} <b>anti-spyware</b> application can be 100% {{effective against}} all keyloggers.Also, software-based <b>anti-spyware</b> cannot defeat non-software keyloggers (for example, hardware keyloggers attached to keyboards will always receive keystrokes before any software-based <b>anti-spyware</b> application).|$|E
50|$|However, the {{particular}} technique that the <b>anti-spyware</b> application uses will influence its potential effectiveness against software keyloggers. As a general rule, <b>anti-spyware</b> applications with higher privileges will defeat keyloggers with lower privileges. For example, a hook-based <b>anti-spyware</b> application cannot defeat a kernel-based keylogger (as the keylogger {{will receive the}} keystroke messages before the <b>anti-spyware</b> application), but it could potentially defeat hook- and API-based keyloggers.|$|E
50|$|The company {{launched}} the first <b>anti-spyware</b> product commercially {{and was the}} first to provide a no-strings-attached free security product for home use. Lavasoft was {{a founding member of the}} <b>Anti-Spyware</b> Coalition, a trade organization focused on best practices in the <b>anti-spyware</b> and anti-malware industry.|$|E
50|$|Various <b>anti-spyware</b> removal {{tools are}} known to remove VirusHeat. The latest {{definition}} file must be utilized in most <b>anti-spyware</b> programs to completely remove VirusHeat and any associated files.|$|E
5000|$|SpySubtracter was {{the name}} of an <b>Anti-Spyware</b> {{application}} for Microsoft Windows developed by InterMute. It is now maintained by Trend Micro under the new name of Trend Micro <b>Anti-Spyware.</b>|$|E
5000|$|After Grisoft's acquisition, however, Ewido's <b>Anti-Spyware</b> {{developments}} has not stopped. It {{continues to}} exist as Ewido Online Scanner or Ewido Micro Scanner, that uses the full Ewido engine and signatures, without excluding heuristic detection options. As of AVG 8.0, AVG <b>Anti-Spyware</b> is integrated into AVG Anti-Virus {{and is no longer}} available as a standalone product. That means that AVG <b>Anti-Spyware</b> will not receive updates any more.|$|E
50|$|SpyLocked {{is known}} to be {{associated}} with such rogue <b>anti-spyware</b> programs as Spydawn, SpySheriff, SpywareQuake, VirusBurst, and VirusLocker. These programs share similar interface with the mentioned <b>anti-spyware</b> applications and have the same deceptive intentions.|$|E
