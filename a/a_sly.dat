The artist is billed as a pioneer of German Modernism, but his work bears <b>a</b> <b>sly</b> resemblance to Cornell's.|$|E

"Ay, marry, will I {{join with}} you all," [...] quoth the Tinker, [...] "for I love a merry life, and I love thee, good master, though thou didst thwack my ribs and cheat {{me into the}} bargain. Fain am I to own thou art both a stouter and <b>a</b> <b>slyer</b> man than I; so I will obey thee and be thine own true servant." ...|$|R

25|$|Sly {{recorded}} {{two more}} albums for Epic: High on You (1975) and Heard You Missed Me, Well I'm Back (1976). High On You {{was billed as}} <b>a</b> <b>Sly</b> Stone solo album; Heard You Missed Me was <b>a</b> <b>Sly</b> and the Family Stone album in name only. Although Sly continued to collaborate {{with some of the}} original Family Stone members on occasion, the actual band no longer existed. Sly played most of the instruments on record himself; he maintained a band to support him for live shows. Among his main collaborators were Cynthia Robinson and Pat Rizzo from the Family Stone, and background vocalists Lynn Mabry and Dawn Silva, who parted with Sly in 1977 and formed The Brides of Funkenstein in 1978. Epic released Stone from his contract in 1977, and in 1979 released 10 Years Too Soon, a remix album featuring disco versions of the 1960s Family Stone hits.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>Sly</b> and the Family Stone tribute {{took place}} at the 2006 Grammy Awards on February 8, 2006. The {{original}} plan, to have been a surprise for audiences, was to feature a reunion performance by the original Sly and the Family Stone lineup as the highlight of the tribute. However, the Grammy Award show's producers were worried that Sly Stone, who missed some of the rehearsals and belatedly arrived for others, would miss the show.|$|E
25|$|For the film's poster, Universal brought Campbell in to {{take several}} {{reference}} head shots {{and asked him to}} strike <b>a</b> <b>sly</b> look on his face. They showed him a rough of the Frank Frazetta-like painting. The actor had a day to approve it or, as he was told, there would be no ad campaign for the film. Raimi ran into further troubles when the MPAA gave it an NC-17 rating for a shot of a female Deadite being decapitated early on in the film. Universal wanted a PG-13 rating, so Raimi made a few cuts and was still stuck with an R rating. In response, Universal turned the film over to outside film editors who cut the film to 81 minutes and another version running 87 minutes that was eventually released in theaters, still with an R rating.|$|E

500|$|The Number Devil: A Mathematical Adventure (...) is a {{book for}} {{children}} and young adults that explores mathematics. It was originally written in 1997 in German by Hans Magnus Enzensberger and illustrated by Rotraut Susanne Berner. The book follows a young boy named Robert, who is taught mathematics by <b>a</b> <b>sly</b> [...] "number devil" [...] called Teplotaxl over the course of twelve dreams.|$|E
500|$|For the show's 2007 episodes, 30 Rock {{received}} a Peabody Award at the 67th Annual Peabody Awards. Upon announcing the award, the Peabody Board commended {{the show for}} being [...] "not only a great workplace comedy {{in the tradition of}} The Mary Tyler Moore Show, complete with fresh, indelible secondary characters, but also <b>a</b> <b>sly,</b> gleeful satire of corporate media, especially the network that airs it." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The song of Carey's career, {{where the}} lyrical strokes are as broad and obvious {{as they are}} naked. Mariah the chanter {{flawlessly}} adapts to their singsong style, largely boxing her multi-octave range into <b>a</b> <b>sly,</b> hypnotic melody so that when she really wails at the end, you really feel it. Carey lunges toward musical maturity by embracing, not shunning hip-hop. This is the height of her elegance and maybe hip-hop-soul's, too." ...|$|E
500|$|The bronze {{sculpture}} sits on {{a circular}} base {{in the middle of}} the basin. The sculpture is officially known as Boy with a Turtle, as its figure is of a young boy, in the nude, riding a sea turtle. In 1986 the Worcester municipal parks and recreation department described the statue with the sentence, [...] "The boy holding the turtle, his hair flying, <b>a</b> <b>sly</b> smile on his face, is charming and disarming." ...|$|E
500|$|According to some sources, {{the peach}} being [...] "eaten" [...] was [...] "the two-legged Georgia variety". Drummer Butch Trucks also {{considered}} Allman's comment <b>a</b> <b>sly</b> {{reference to the}} poem [...] "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" [...] by T. S. Eliot, one of Allman's favorite poets. An untrue story persisted for many years after the album's release that it was named after the truck Allman crashed into, purported to be a peach truck. The album art was later selected by Rolling Stone magazine in 1991 {{as one of the}} 100 greatest album covers of all time.|$|E

500|$|Chelsea’s victory {{meant they}} won the trophy for the sixth time. Mourinho was delighted to have won the League Cup and felt his team {{deserved}} to win on balance of play. He credited his opponents, with <b>a</b> <b>sly</b> dig: [...] "A special word for them – they played very good. They have a great coach, great players – but football is about winning and the cup goes to us." [...] He was disappointed by the fracas and pointed out it {{was born out of}} Arsenal's frustration, though stressed [...] "We cannot kill a player because something happened." [...] Mourinho took time out to praise Arsenal’s medical staff for attending to Terry after his concussion and absolved Diaby from any fault.|$|E
500|$|The album's muddy, gritty {{sound was}} {{due in part to}} this overdubbing and erasing and mixing {{techniques}} nearly drowned out undubbed sounds. Miles Marshall Lewis stated [...] "Never before on <b>a</b> <b>Sly</b> and the Family Stone album were songs open to so much interpretation, and even more so, dripping with cynicism. On the other hand you can hardly hear what he's saying for most of the album. Like Radiohead's Kid A or even the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main St. more recent to the time, a murkiness in the mix of the record inhibits complete comprehension of the words." [...] Stone felt that the rhythm box made unrealistic sounds if used as designed, so he resorted to overdubbing the drum sounds manually, again contributing to the difficult mix.|$|E
500|$|Two {{music videos}} were {{released}} from the albums: [...] "Tilt-a-Whirl," [...] from Bizaar, and [...] "Let's Go All The Way", a cover of <b>a</b> <b>Sly</b> Fox song from Bizzar. MTV agreed to play [...] "Let's Go All The Way" [...] on their network, airing it once in the late evening. Bruce and Utsler decided to bombard Total Request Live (TRL) with requests for the video. While on their [...] "Bizaar Bizzar Tour", Insane Clown Posse posted on its website that December 8 was the day for their fans request the video. Bruce and Utsler named that day [...] "The Mighty Day of Lienda," [...] meaning [...] "The Mighty Day of All or Nothing". On December 8, Rudy Hill, Robert Bruce, Tom Dub, and six other Psychopathic Records employees and friends drove down to New York City.|$|E

50|$|Based on the now stereotypical {{pairing of}} a big, strong warrior and <b>a</b> small, <b>sly</b> thief first {{established}} by Fritz Leiber's classic stories of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, Westala and Villtin are mercenaries of dubious morality but a strong code of honour.|$|R
500|$|... "Breakdown" [...] {{garnered}} positive {{reviews from}} local critics. David Browne from Entertainment Weekly praised the song, writing [...] "for {{most of the}} album she keeps her notorious octave-climbing chops at bay. Showing some admirable restraint, she nestles herself into downy-soft beats. In 'Breakdown', she demonstrates she can match the staccato, lite-reggae phrasing of her guests, two members of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony." [...] Rich Juzwiak from Slant called [...] "Breakdown" [...] "the song of Carey's career," [...] noting its [...] "lyrical strokes [...] as broad and obvious as they are naked. Mariah the chanter flawlessly adapts to their singsong style, largely boxing her multi-octave range into <b>a</b> <b>sly,</b> hypnotic melody so that when she really wails at the end, you really feel it. As with 'The Roof', Carey lunges toward musical maturity by embracing, not shunning hip-hop. This is the height of her elegance and maybe hip-hop-soul's, too." ...|$|E
500|$|The module {{begins with}} a prologue {{explaining}} that giants of different types have been raiding lands occupied by humans. Angered by this, the human rulers hire a group of adventurers (the player characters) to [...] "punish the miscreant giants." [...] The players' party is informed that they must defeat the giants, or have their heads placed on the chopping block. The human nobles equip the party with weapons and horses, along with a guide and a map that shows {{the location of the}} hill giants. The players are informed that the hill giants are led by Nosnra, <b>a</b> <b>sly</b> hill giant chieftain who loves to set up ambushes; there is an unknown force binding together different giant groups. The player characters are informed that they may keep any spoils they find, but must return at once if they determine what [...] "sinister hand" [...] is behind the alliance.|$|E
500|$|Although Bacon revered Velázquez's portrait, {{he did not}} try to {{reproduce}} the earlier painting. In interviews, he said that he saw flaws in Velázquez's work and that he viewed that social structure and order as, according to Schmied, [...] "obsolete and decayed". Bacon's approach was to elevate his subject so he could knock him down again, thereby making <b>a</b> <b>sly</b> comment on the treatment of royalty in both Old Master and contemporary painting. Yet Velázquez's influence is apparent in many aspects of the painting. The sitter's pose closely echoes the original, as does the violet and white colouring of his cope, which is built up through broad, thick, brush-strokes. The influence can be further seen in the gold-coloured ornaments {{on the back of the}} seat that extend on both sides of the figure. Art historian Armin Zweite describes the work as a mixture of reverence and subversion that pays tribute to Velázquez, while at the same time deconstructs his painting.|$|E
6000|$|Dolly {{broke into}} <b>a</b> mischievous <b>sly</b> smile. [...] "Yes, it is," [...] she continued. [...] "And, oh, Uncle Sey, where the restorer has--er--restored it, you know, {{it comes out}} in the {{photograph}} {{with a sort of}} brilliant iridescent metallic sheen on it!" ...|$|R
