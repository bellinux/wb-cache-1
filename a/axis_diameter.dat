50|$|The Charity Shoal Crater {{is a small}} oval basin with a {{circular}} rim that is approximately 1.2-1.5 km in diameter. A continuous rim encircles the crater floor, ranging in water depth from less than 1 m at the Charity Shoal Lighthouse on the eastern rim, to just over 10 m at the southernmost juncture of the rim. The exterior slopes of its rim are less steep than its interior slopes. Northeast-southwest trending erosional valleys cut across the southwestern sector of the crater rim. The crater floor is slightly ovoid, with a northwest-southeast-oriented long <b>axis</b> <b>diameter</b> of about 1 km and a short <b>axis</b> <b>diameter</b> of about 0.8 km.

Therefore, 11 conscious dogs were instrumented with global ultrasonic dimension transducers to measure left ventricular major and minor <b>axis</b> <b>diameters</b> and equatorial wall thickness. Myocardial geometry was represented as a three-dimensional ellipsoidal shell. Left ventricular transmural pressure was measured with micro-manometers, and ventricular volume was varied by inflation of vena caval occluders. Left ventricular wall strains and stresses calculated from the ellipsoidal shell model agreed closely with those measured directly by myocardial force and dimension transducers. Unequal normalized diastolic stress-strain relations were observed in the latitudinal, longitudinal, and wall thickness directions, reflecting anisotropic mechanical properties of the myocardium. Although a greater wall stress in the latitudinal versus longitudinal axis was predicted adequately from left ventricular geometry alone, the observed latitudinal strain exceeded longitudinal strain by an amount greater than was predicted by geometric considerations alone, suggesting that myocardial anisotropy contributes significantly to changes in ventricular shape during diastolic filling.

IntroductionLN metastasis {{is one of the most}} significant independent prognostic factors in patients with HCCA. Presently, in spite of the well known lack of sensitivity and specificity, one of the most used clinical criteria for nodal metastases is LN size. MethodsPathological slides of 147 patients who had undergone exploration for HCCA were assessed. The size (maximum and short <b>axis</b> <b>diameter)</b> of each single node was retrieved from the pathology report or measured from a section on the glass slide using a stereo microscope and a calibrated ruler integrated in the software. When a metastatic lesion was detected, the proportion of the lesion in relation to LN size was estimated. ResultsOut of 147 patients, 645 LN were retrieved and measured. In all, 106 nodes (16 %) showed evidence of metastasis. The proportion of positive nodes was 8 % in nodes 30 mm. Ten per cent of LN smaller than 10 mm were positive, whereas only 23 % of LN larger than 10 mm were metastastically involved. No clear cut-off point could be found. Similar results were found for the short <b>axis</b> <b>diameter.</b> In 50 % of positive LN, the metastatic lesion accounted for 10 % or less of the LN size. ConclusionNo cut-off point could be determined for accurately predicting nodal involvement. Therefore, imaging studies should not rely on LN size when assessing nodal involvement...|$|E

The long <b>axis</b> <b>diameter</b> (LAD), the short <b>axis</b> <b>diameter</b> (SAD) and the bi-dimensional WHO of 307 target lymph nodes were measured manually and semi-automatically using dedicated software. Lymph node volumetry was performed semi-automatically only. The therapeutic response was evaluated according to lymphoma-adapted RECIST. Results: Based on a single lymph node, semi-automatically derived multidimensional parameters allowed for significantly more accurate therapy response classification than the manual or the semi- automatic unidimensional parameters. Incorrect classifications were reduced by up to 9. 6 %. Compared to the manual approach, {{the influence of the}} study center on correct therapy classification is significantly less relevant when using semi-automatic measurements. Conclusion: Semi-automatic volumetry and bi-dimensional WHO significantly reduce the number of incorrectly classified lymphoma patients by approximately 9. 6 % in the multicenter setting in comparison to linear parameters. Semi-automatic quantitative software tools may help to significantly reduce wrong classifications that are associated with the manual assessment approach.

40|$|Introduction. The {{state of}} pelvic and retroperitoneal lymph nodes is an {{important}} prognostic factor for cervical cancer. Lymph node size is {{the most widely used}} CT and MR criteria for assessing lymph node status. Lymph nodes measuring more than 1 cm in the short <b>axis</b> <b>diameter</b> are considered malignant. However this criterion (nodal size) is not foolproof because of a high percentage of diagnostic errors. The {{purpose of the study was}} to develop objective MRI criteria for assessing lymph node metastasis in patients with cervical cancer by measuring the short- and the long-axis diameters of lymph nodes, short axis/long axis ratio (configuration index) and to evaluate their diagnostic value. Materials and methods. The prospective study included 31 patients with histologically confirmed cervical cancer, who underwent radical surgery with standard lymph node dissection. Sixty removed lymph nodes were evaluated. MRI examinations were performed using a 1. 5 T scanner in T 2 - weighted images (T 2 -WI), T 1 -WI and T 2 weighted sequences with fatty tissue signal suppressing and diffusionweighted MRI. Results. Lymph nodes measuring ≥ 0. 8 cm in the short <b>axis</b> <b>diameter</b> were considered suspicious for metastatic disease. The sensitivity and specificity with a cutoff of ≥ 0. 8 cm were 68 % (CI 48. 3 ‑ 82. 9) and 80 % (CI 63. 8 ‑ 90. 3), respectively; the positive and negative predictive values were 71 % and 78 %, respectively; and the accuracy was 75 % (CI 62. 7 ‑ 84. 3). The short axis/long axis ratio (configuration index) of < 1. 47 indicated a likelihood of pathology in the lymph node. The absence of the hypointense signal from the fatty hilum of lymph nodes was considered as a predictor of lymph node metastasis. The analysis of this criterion showed 80 % sensitivity (CI 60. 4 ‑ 91. 6), 85. 7 % specificity (60. 4 ‑ 91. 6), 80 % PPV, 85. 1 % NPV and 83. 3 % accuracy (CI 60. 4 ‑ 91. 6). Conclusion.

The risk on having lymph node metastases was calculated using the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomograms ([URL] and the ROACH formula (Roach et al. 1994). Lesions suspected for prostate cancer were scored at different anatomical locations, including: prostate, seminal vesicles, locoregional lymph nodes (N 1 according to the Prostate Cancer Staging of the American Joint Committee on Cancer, 7 th edition), distant lymph nodes (M 1 a), bone lesions (M 1 b), other distant metastases (M 1 c).

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the feasibility of volumetric analysis of lymph node metastases using a software prototype in a follow-up setting. Methods: MSCT was performed in 50 patients covering the chest, abdomen and pelvis. A total of 174 suspicious lymph nodes were evaluated by two radiologists regarding short <b>axis</b> <b>diameters</b> and volumetric analysis using semi-automated software. Quality of segmentation, time, maximum diameter and volume were documented. Variability of the derived change rates was computed as the standard deviation of the difference of the obtained respective change rates. Results: The software performance provides robust volumetric analysis. Quality of segmentation was rated acceptable to excellent in 76 - 79 % by each reader. Mean time spent per lesion was 38 s. The variability of change in effective diameters was 10. 6 %; for change rates of RECIST maximum diameter variability was 27. 5 %. Conclusion: Semi-automated volumetric analysis allows fast and convenient segmentation of most lymph node metastases. Compared with RECIST the inter-observer-variability in baseline and follow-up is reduced. This should principally allow subtle changes to be subclassified within the RECIST stable range as minor response [- 15 % to + 10 %]...|$|R

Left ventricular minor and major <b>axis</b> <b>diameters</b> and equatorial wall thickness were measured with implanted pulse-transit ultrasonic dimension transducers. Left ventricular and pleural pressures were measured with high fidelity micromanometers. Circumferential mural stress was calculated by using an ellipsoidal shell theory; circumferential strain was calculated by using a natural strain definition. The static elastic properties of the myocardium were estimated by fitting the stress-strain values at the points of diastasis during a vena caval occlusion to an exponential function. A modified creep {{test was used to}} evaluate the series viscous properties of the myocardium. Acute increases in systolic and diastolic loading were produced by inflating implanted aortic occluders for 15 minutes in five dogs. In these dogs, the static stress-strain curves were not altered significantly after this period of pressure loading, indicating tbat short-term series viscous properties are negligible. Parallel viscous properties were evaluated in 10 dogs by means of the variable rate stretch test of dynamic diastolic filling. A viscoelastic model incorporating a parallel viscous element fit the dynamic stress-strain data better and predicted the static elastic properties more accurately than a simple exponential model. Thus, the mechanical characteristics of the diastolic left ventricle can be represented most precisely by a viscoelastic model that includes a parallel viscous element...|$|R
