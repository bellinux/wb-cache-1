25|$|The Oyster card is a {{contactless}} {{smart card}} system introduced for the public in 2003, {{which can be used}} to pay individual fares (pay <b>as</b> <b>you</b> go) or to carry various Travelcards and other passes. It is used by holding the card close to the yellow card reader. Card readers are found on ticket gates where otherwise a paper ticket could be fed through, allowing the gate to open and the passenger to walk through, and on stand-alone Oyster validators, which do not operate a barrier. Since 2010, Oyster Pay <b>as</b> <b>you</b> go has been available on all National Rail services within London. Oyster Pay <b>as</b> <b>you</b> go has a set of daily maximum charges that are the same as buying the nearest equivalent Day Travelcard.|$|E
