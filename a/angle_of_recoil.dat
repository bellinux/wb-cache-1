40|$|In this paper, we {{indicate}} {{a possibility of}} utilizing the elastic scattering of the Dirac low energy (∼ 1 MeV) electron neutrinos (ν_e's) on the polarized electron target (PET) in testing the time reversal symmetry violation (TRSV). We consider a scenario in which the incoming ν_e beam is the superposition of left chiral (LC) and right chiral (RC) states. LC ν_e's interact mainly by the standard V - A, while RC ones are only detected by the exotic V + A and S_R, P_R, T_R interactions. One assumes that the spin polarization vector of the initial ν_e's is turned aside from the ν_e momentum, and due to this the non-vanishing transversal component of the ν_e spin polarization appears. We compute the differential cross section as a function <b>of</b> the <b>recoil</b> electron azimuthal angle and scattered electron energy, and show how the interference terms between standard V-A and exotic S_R, P_R, T_R couplings depend on the various angular correlations among the transversal ν_e spin polarization, the polarization of the electron target, the incoming neutrino momentum and the outgoing electron momentum {{in the limit of}} relativistic ν_e.

A weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) -mass independent method is used to obtain the sensitivity of a general detector in an isothermal galactic dark matter halo. By using two-dimensional distributions of energy and polar angle, a detector without head-tail information with 6. 3 times the statistics is found {{to achieve the same}} performance level as a full three-dimensional tracking dark matter detector. Optimum operation orientations are obtained for various experimental configurations, with detectors that are space- or Earth-fixed, have head-tail capability or not, and use energy information or not. Earth-fixed detectors are found to have best sensitivity when the polar axis is oriented at a 45 degree angle from the Earth's pole. With background contamination that mimics the WIMP signal's energy distribution, the performance is found to decrease at a rate less than the decrease of signal purity. The WIMP-mass dependence of the performance of a detector with various energy thresholds that uses gaseous xenon as target material is reported. We find that with a 5 × 10 ^- 46 cm^ 2 spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross-section and a 30 GeV WIMP, a 770 kg·year's exposure with a polar detector of 10 keV threshold can make a three sigma discovery of directional WIMPs in the isothermal galactic dark matter halo.

The photodissociation work was performed at the University of Nevada with additional, partial support from NSF. In the summer of 1999 this technique was transported to and implemented at the Combustion Research Facility at Sandia National Laboratory in Livermore, CA in a study of rotationally inelastic collisions of NO molecules with Ar atoms. The summer 1999 experiments at Sandia demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} detect collision-induced rotational alignment (preferred planes of rotation) for product molecules. During the late summer and fall of 1999 the P. I. and student James Barr developed a theoretical method for quantifying the angular momentum alignment and for extracting it from ion images. During the winter and spring of 2000 (January-May) the P. I. was in residence at Sandia National Laboratory in Livermore during a sabbatical leave from the University of Nevada. During this time the P. I. collaborated with Sandia P. I. Dr. David Chandler and Sandia postdoctorals Thomas Lorenz and Elisabeth Wade in experiments measuring both rotational alignment and rotational orientation (preferred senses of rotation) in collisions of NO with Ar. Graduate student James Barr continued these experiments at Sandia through the end of June 2000. The success of our experimental techniques for measuring collisional alignment and the theoretical methods we have developed for extracting quantitative alignment parameters from ion images. Spectroscopic probing of products by resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) detected by ion imaging is a powerful method for measuring the product state-resolved differential cross section (DCS) of bimolecular scattering reactions.

We exploit this sensitivity to obtain the state-resolved product angular momentum polarization as a function <b>of</b> <b>recoil</b> <b>angle.</b> Previous measurements <b>of</b> molecular angular momentum polarization in bimolecular scattering have either been constrained to detection in the scattering plane or have averaged around the azimuthal <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>recoil</b> velocity vector in the collision frame.
