Here we describe anomalous behavior of a different type that is associated with a sorbent-triggered first-order phase transition. The system of interest is a hydrophilic, semicrystalline polymer with hydrophobic end groups, placed in contact with humid air. Dueto the strong tendency to absorb water, the melting transition of the crystallites can be induced by contact with sufficiently humid air; during desorption, a sufficient supersaturation mustbe reached before nucleation and regrowth of crystals occur. This leads to very different hysteresis in the sorption isotherm and overshoot in transient sorption than has been reported previously in polymers...|$|E

Measurements were carried out with two experimental setups: (1) passing nitrogen through a humidity generator and allowing the gas stream to become saturated at a measured temperature and pressure, and (2) injecting water via a syringe pump into a nitrogen stream. Both water vapor generating devices were attached to a downstream vertically-mounted water capture bed filled with 19. 5 g of Moisture Gone desiccant.

All phases of the water capture process (background, heating, <b>absorption,</b> <b>desorption,</b> and cooling) were monitored with capacitance. The measured capacitance was found to vary linearly with the water content in the bed at frequencies above 100 kHz indicating dipolar motion dominated the signal; below this frequency, ionic motion caused nonlinearities in the water concentration/capacitance relationship.

Reaction bonded (RB) SiC samples were deuterium implanted at both room temperature and 450 °C at different implantation energies and the corresponding TSD spectrum was obtained for each implantation energy. After implantation the samples were subjected to SIMS analysis. The TSD spectra obtained for all the samples implanted at different energies are very similar and characterized by a prominent deuterium desorption occurring at temperatures between 450 and 1000 °C with a maximum that exhibits a clear trend to shift toward higher temperature as either implantation energy or implantation temperature increase. SIMS analysis before heating the deuterium implanted samples indicates that the implanted deuterium {{has a tendency to}} become bonded to Si rather than to C. The SIMS analysis shows that once heated up to 1000 °C only part of the implanted deuterium was thermally released.

Of the three ways of storing hydrogen, viz. by compressed gas, in liquid form, or as hydride, the latter is rather promising both for its relevant storage capacity and safety [2]. There are several materials which show reversible hydrogen <b>absorption</b> <b>desorption</b> properties. However, to be suitable for the on-board hydrogen storage for vehicular applications, the storage material should have the following properties: (a) high storage capacity; (b) moderate absorption/desorption temperatures; (c) fast hydrogenation/dehydrogenation kinetics; (d) high resistance to degradation and contamination on thermal and charge/discharge cycling. Recently, many research efforts have been devoted to modify the sorption properties of different materials in order to approach the above mentioned properties. Nanostructuring of the powders is one of the obliged ways in tailoring novel materials, inasmuch as this procedure increases the surface/volume ratio and has beneficial effects on the absorption/desorption kinetics. Citing few examples from literature, this presentation describes how nanostructuring can be utilized for improving the sorption kinetics of different potential hydrogen storage materials.

Distillation is a major separation system by means of heat supplied from a higher temperature level at the reboiler and rejected in the condenser at a lower temperature level. Therefore, it resembles a heat engine producing a separation work with a rather low efficiency. Lost work (energy) in separation systems is due to irreversible processes of heat, mass transfer, and mixing, and {{is directly related to}} entropy production according to the Gouy-Stodola principle. In many separation systems of <b>absorption,</b> <b>desorption,</b> extraction, and membrane separation, the major irreversibility is the mass transfer process. In the last 30 years or so, thermodynamic analysis had become popular in evaluating the efficiency of separation systems. Thermodynamic analysis emphasizes the use of the second law of thermodynamics beside the first law, and may be applied through (i) the pinch analysis, (ii) the exergy analysis, and (iii) the equipartition principle. The pinch analysis aims a better integration of a process with its utilities. It is one of the mostly accepted and utilized methods in reducing energy cost. Exergy analysis describes the maximum available work when a form of energy is converted reversibly to a reference system in equilibrium with the environmental conditions; hence, it can relate the impact of energy utilization to the environmental degradation. On the other hand, the equipartition principle states that a separation operation would be optimum for a specified set of fluxes and a given transfer area when the thermodynamic driving forces are uniformly distributed in space and time. Thermodynamic analysis aims at identifying, quantifying, and minimizing irreversibilities in a separation system.

According to Documents about Best Available Techniques (BREFs), Higee technology is emerging {{as an alternative to the}} methods used so far. This work studies Higee technology improvements applied to the absorption process compared to conventional packed columns. The absorption is mainly used to remove pollutant components of a gas stream to avoid leaks outside and/or to recover some component that the stream could contain for production purposes. To achieve the goals of this project, a bibliographic search of Higee technology, studied by different authors, has been performed. In this research, the focus is on the modifications made in recent years in order to show the advantages of this technology compared to the conventional one. After this research, the design of a conventional absorption column and Rotating Packed Bed have been studied in order to make a comparison among the design results and a comparison of these with those obtained experimentally by the different authors. From these studies the main conclusion is that the use of Higee technology get a huge reduction in the volume of the device and it is also possible to use smaller amounts of absorbent liquid. However, Higee technology presents some disadvantages over conventional technology because it is necessary that the absorbent liquid be subjected to a centrifugal force, so this will require greater energy. All these changes make the design more complex and the device suffers a faster wear due to continuous movement and, consequently, it increases the economic cost. Thus, based on studies performed so far, replacing the conventional absorption column for Higee technology is not recommendable. However, it should be further investigated because it has potential to get better results in comparison with conventional processes, either applied in the process studied in this work or applied to another types of processes...|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{capture and}} storage {{is vital to}} facilitating the {{transition}} from our current fossil fuel-based energy system to a sustainable energy system. The concept of post-combustion capture {{is based on the}} selective chemical absorption of carbon dioxide (CO 2). The highly concentrated CO 2 stream that is suitable for storage is generated by heat-induced regeneration of the solvent. In this work, ammonia is evaluated as an absorbent of CO 2 in post-combustion capture processes. The major goals of this thesis are to define favorable applications and local conditions for ammonia-based post-combustion capture processes. The current benchmarking absorbent, monoethanolamine (MEA), has inherent problems is associated with specific drawbacks, such as a high heat requirement for regeneration and a tendency to undergo degradation during operation. Several novel absorbents, including ammonia, have been proposed as being superior to MEA in these aspects. The major disadvantage of ammonia is its volatility, which results in loss of absorbent (slip). This thesis reveals the results of experimental, technical and economic performance analyses. To evaluate the capture process, validation of thermodynamic models of the NH 3 -CO 2 -H 2 O system is required. These thermodynamic models rely on a comprehensive experimental data on the solid-liquid-gas equilibrium for all operating conditions. This work presents new gas-liquid equilibrium data for temperatures that are relevant to the absorber (< 25 °C), which is an operating range of no prior industrial interest. This work presents the results of simulations of the <b>absorption,</b> <b>desorption</b> and ammonia recovery processes, for both the individual component level and the aggregated capture cycle. The performance of ammonia-based post-combustion capture is evaluated under various operational and local conditions. The design of a full-scale, ammonia-based capture process is described and the cost of capture is estimated for this process integrated with a coal-fired power plant. Special attention is focused on the design of the absorber system. In this thesis, a dual absorber with intermediate cooling is proposed as an essential measure to reduce ammonia slip. Preferable operating conditions for the absorber system are defined as: lean and rich CO 2 loadings of 0. 25 and 0. 50, respectively; and a concentration of ammonia (CO 2 -free) of 14. 3 wt%. The thesis concludes that ammonia-based absorbents represent a feasible alternative to the first- and second-generation absorbents for post-combustion capture of CO 2. The specific total heat requirement for ammonia-based capture is calculated to be approximately 3, 000 kJ/kg CO 2. The most serious problem identified with respect to the ammonia process is the cost of reducing the ammonia slip to allowable levels. This concern limits the locations at which the present process could be implemented with commercial success. Successful application of ammonia-based post-combustion capture is expected to be achieved at locations that are characterized by access to low-temperature cooling water (~ 5 °C) and a high concentration of CO 2 (~ 15 vol%) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{chemical}} reactions involved in CO 2 <b>absorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> by chemical absorbents such as aqueous amines are being investigated and modelled {{to identify and}} make potential improvements in efficiency. Recent advances in FT-IR spectroscopy have allowed for convenient and rapid analysis of chemical species {{to be carried out}} in an aqueous environment. This paper presents the findings of an investigation of carbon dioxide <b>absorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> into/from amine solutions. The amines investigated, including primary capture solvents (eg. MEA) as well as promoters (eg. MDEA), have been selected to demonstrate that both carbamate and carbonate formation can be monitored using this technique. New insights into a much applied but little understood industrial chemical process have been revealed...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} {{application of}} intermetallic compounds (IMC) under high hydrogen pressure in studies of hydrogen sorption properties is defined by two important properties. Intermetallics of Laves phases have a suitable binding energy for hydrogen which allows its <b>absorption</b> or <b>desorption</b> near room temperature and atmospheric pressure. High pressures allow to efficiently interact hydrogen with intermetallics, which were considered nonhydride forming [1, 2]. For example, ZrFe 2, ZrCo 2, and ZrFe 2 possess fairly high hydrogen absorption capacity at high pressures [3]. A nonactivated ZrFe 2 sample starts to interact with hydrogen only at 80 MPa, while equilibrium <b>absorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> pressures of the activated alloy on a plateau are 69 and 32. 5 MPa, respectively. Even though ZrFe 2 and related Laves phases are subjected only to moderate hydrogen pressures during <b>absorption</b> and <b>desorption,</b> {{it is essential to}} understand the structural phase stability under variable pressure-temperature conditions. The present investigation is aimed to study the pressure induced structural changes in ZrFe 2 using synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction. High pressure structural studies were performed up to 50 GPa using a diamond anvil cell in the angle dispersion geometry...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The p-c-T {{curves of}} tritium <b>absorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> of {{titanium}} were measured {{using the method}} of step equilibrium by stepping up the tritium quantity on an experimental apparatus of metal hydride. The p-c-T curves for tritium have one plateau at temperature below 300 ℃ and two plateaus at temperature above 300 ℃. The thermodynamic parameters of the different phases were determined according to the van’t Hoff equation. The hysteresis effect was not observed in reversible process of tritium <b>absorption</b> and <b>desorption</b> of titanium on our experimental condition. The tritium absorption behavior of titanium in the temperature ranging from 550 ℃ to 750 ℃ and desorption behavior of titanium in the temperature ranging from 350 ℃ to 550 ℃ have been investigated in a constant volume system. A method of the reaction rate analysis was proposed and examined for determining the rate constant. The apparent activation energy obtained by this analysis for the <b>absorption</b> and the <b>desorption</b> were (155. 5 ± 3. 2) kJ/mol and (62. 1 ± 1. 6) kJ/mol respectively...|$|R
