We report the exceptional case of an immunocompetent man aged 51 and who presented with hepatitis and meningitis by herpes simplex virus. Encephalitis responded to acyclovir but hepatitis did not. The patient developed diffuse hydrocephalus that required the appropriate shunt 20 days after being asymptomatic.

40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{infection}} {{can cause}} acute, fulminant or chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Perinatally or childhood acquired HBV infection usually causes subclinical or <b>anicteric</b> acute <b>hepatitis</b> and {{is associated with}} a high risk of chronicity (30 to 90 % of cases), whereas adult acquired infection may cause acute symptomatic hepatitis (approximately 30 % of patients) and {{is associated with a}} low risk of chronicity (less than 5 %). Fulminant hepatic failure is unusual (0. 1 to 0. 5 % of patients), but acute coinfection with other hepatitis viruses increases the risk of fulminant hepatitis. Chronic HBV infection is a dynamic process with an early replicative phase and active liver disease and a late low or non replicative phase with remission of liver disease. Perinatally acquired HBV infection is characterized by a prolonged “immunotolerant ” phase with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positivity, high levels of serum HBV-DNA, normal levels of aminotransferases, minimal liver damage and very low rates of spontaneous HBeAg clearance. Patients with childhood or adult acquired infection and chronic hepatitis B usually present in the “immunoactive ” phase with elevated aminotransferases and liver necroinflammation at histology (HBeAg positive chronic hepatitis) and approximately 50 % will clear HBeAg within 5 years. The rate of spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion may vary in relation to the degree of the elevation of aminotransferases. Seroconversion from HBeAg to antibody to HBeAg marks the transition from chronic hepatitis to the inactiv...|$|R

40|$|Endemic {{hepatitis}} occurred {{among the}} personnel {{of a research}} laboratory working with human blood and tissues {{in the study of}} Australia antigen (Au(l)). All individuals were tested for serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) levels and Au(l). Fifty-six were tested at monthly intervals on 5 to 32 occasions over 3 % years. Eighty-three others were tested less frequently. Twenty-seven changes were found in the serums of the 56 people tested frequently enough to have their course examined. There were four cases of typical acute hepatitis with Au(l) in the serum, fifteen staff members with rises in SGPT indicative of acute <b>anicteric</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> and eight staff members with small SGPT rises. We have termed this laboratory-acquired infection "ergasteric hepatitis " from the Greek word for laboratory. Seven patients were treated with bed rest as soon as the SGPT exceeded 50 units; in six the levels promptly returned to normal. We recommend strict infectious precautions and monthly monitoring of SGPT and Au(l) in personnel exposed to human (or nonhuman primate) blood or tissues. AUSTRALIA ANTIGEN (A U (1)) was first detected in the blood of an Australian aborigine in 1963 (1). Through a series of sequential studies, patients with Down's syndrome were ultimately tested for Au (l) (2, 3); it was in one of these patients in 1966 that we found that Au (l) could be acquired.

40|$|SUMMARY Cross {{hepatotoxicity}} between {{drugs is}} very uncommon. We report {{the case of}} a patient in whom acute hepatitis was induced by a tricyclic antidepressant, amineptine, and recurred early after administration of another tricyclic antidepressant, clomipramine. This observation suggests that the tricyclic ring is involved in the mechanism of the deleterious effect of both drugs to the liver. Cross hepatotoxicity is very uncommon: it has been well documented only between derivatives of eryth-romycin, 2 between haloalkane anaesthetics, 3 4 between phenothiazines, 5 and between mianserine and nomifensine, 6 two new antidepressants not belonging to monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic family. In this report, we describe {{the case of a}} patient in whom acute hepatitis was induced by a tricyclic antidepressant, amineptine, and recurred after administration of another tricyclic anti-depressant, clomipramine. Case report A 39 year old woman was admitted on 2 August 1984 for <b>anicteric</b> acute <b>hepatitis.</b> She had no history of previous disease of the liver or biliary tract.

40|$|Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a {{frequent}} cause of acute hepatitis in central an southeast Asia, the Middle East, parts of Africa an Mexico. Its incidence in the US and Europe appears to be very low {{with most of the}} sporadic cases linked to a history of traveling to endemic areas. The major mode of transmission is faeco-oral via faecally contaminated drinking water. Acute HEV infection can present as an <b>anicteric</b> or icteric <b>hepatitis.</b> Fulminant hepatic failure is uncommon, except among pregnant women in whom the illness may be particularly severe. Evolution to chronic hepatitis E infection, cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma has so far not been observed. An HEV infection is diagnosed by identification of HEV IgM and IgG antibodies.

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{spectrum of}} acute hepatitis B virus infection is very broad, with clinical manifestations {{that range from}} <b>anicteric</b> and sub-clinical <b>hepatitis</b> to severe acute icteric hepatitis and even, in some cases, to fulminant hepatitis. Diagnosis depends {{to a large extent}} on the degree of clinical suspicion of hepatitis, establishing the aetiological origin of the B virus through the study of serological markers and/or DNA in the blood. Although in the majority of cases there is a favourable evolution of acute hepatitis B virus infection, with spontaneous resolution of the clinical manifestations in 4 - 8 weeks, progression to chronic hepatitis is not unusual in certain cases, above all in infancy. No specific treatment exists for acute hepatitis B virus infection that would reduce its severity or prevent its evolution into chronic hepatitis. However, relative rest and the administration of an hypercaloric diet are recommended. In cases of severe acute hepatitis hospital admission should be recommended; in cases of fulminant hepatitis, admission to the intensive care unit for intensive monitoring and evaluation of a liver transplantation is recommended if spontaneous improvement does not occur.

40|$|Although it {{has long}} been {{recognized}} that cases of virus hepatitis without jaundice outnumber those with jaundice, particularly among children, only recently—with the introduction of tests to determine the activity of serum transaminases—has it become possible to assess with any accuracy the real frequency of the anicteric forms. In the present paper, the authors report on an investigation in an institution for children in Rome. Some 1000 serum enzyme determinations were made on 104 children and 11 adults; detailed results are given. It was found that among the children <b>anicteric</b> <b>hepatitis</b> predominated over icteric hepatitis in a ratio of 30 : 1 and that the total frequency of virus hepatitis of both forms was strikingly high.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) {{infections are}} frequent. However, HSV {{hepatitis}} is rare and {{may lead to}} a life-threatening condition. CASE REPORT: A 68 -year-old patient with a locally advanced and inoperable esophageal carcinoma was treated with induction chemotherapy and combined chemoradiation. After a total of 9 weeks of treatment, he developed fulminant liver failure of unknown origin and died a few days later. Surprisingly, the post mortem examination revealed an HSV infection of the esophagus and an HSV-associated necrotisizing hepatitis. CONCLUSION: In this immunocompromised patient, we postulate an HSV-associated esophagitis that led to viremia and fulminant hepatitis. Especially in immunocompromised hosts, HSV hepatitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with <b>anicteric</b> <b>hepatitis</b> and marked elevation of transaminases. A liver biopsy is the quickest and most definitive diagnostic tool to diagnose HSV hepatitis. If this is not possible because of severe coagulopathy, polymerase chain reaction for HSV DNA should be performed. Awaiting diagnosis, a prompt empirical treatment with acyclovir has to be discussed in case of a characteristic biochemical profile...|$|E
40|$|During a {{prospective}} study of acute symptomatic viral hepatitis, started in 1978, 664 consecutive adult patients, including 223 drug abusers, fulfilled the diagnostic criteria (anti-HBc IgM positivity) for acute type B hepatitis. In order {{to evaluate the}} outcome of the disease, 443 patients were followed for up to 12 months after the onset. 2. 4 % of the infections became chronic; the rate did not significantly differ between drug addicts and non-drug abusers, suggesting that chronic hepatitis is a rare complication of acute symptomatic hepatitis type B. Ongoing liver damage after clearance of HBsAg from serum was observed in drug abusers only (14 % of the cases). Clinical, biochemical and virological features of the acute phase in patients with ongoing infection were compared with those of uncomplicated cases. <b>Anicteric</b> <b>hepatitis</b> and lower transaminase values were significantly (p less than 0. 05) associated to a chronic evolution of the disease, as well as a higher prevalence of HBV-DNA, DNA polymerase and HBcAg positivity in serum. Testing HBV-DNA and DNA polymerase early {{in the course of the}} infection appeared to be of high predictive value for the subsequent outcome of the illness...|$|E
40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) {{can cause}} {{frequently}} asymptomatic (or <b>anicteric)</b> and self-limited <b>hepatitis,</b> while occasionally {{may result in}} considerable cholestatic hepatitis. Herein, we describe {{the case of a}} previously healthy toddler (26 month old girl) with prolonged cholestasis, elevated serum transaminases, EBV serology compatible with recent EBV infection and positive anti liver kidney microsomal antibody type 1 which is characteristic of new-onset autoimmune hepatitis type 2. Liver biopsy was also typical of autoimmune hepatitis as attested by the presence of portal inflammation with predominant T-lymphocytes and plasma cells and interface hepatitis. Persistent EBV-related hepatitis was excluded by the absence of viral inclusions and steatosis on liver specimens and negative liver EBV-PCR. In conclusion, our case strongly suggests that in children with prolonged cholestatic hepatitis, positive EBV serology cannot exclude the presence of other causes of liver disease. In this context, autoimmune hepatitis should be considered as an alternate diagnosis, particularly when there is specific liver-related autoantibody detection. In such conditions, liver biopsy seems mandatory in an attempt to achieve a correct and timely diagnosis of a potentially catastrophic disease as autoimmune hepatitis. Although some cases of autoimmune hepatitis type 1 following EBV infection have been reported in adults, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, the present case of autoimmune hepatitis type 2 after EBV infection represents the first case in children ever reported in the English literature...|$|R
40|$|In a {{prospective}} study {{the exclusion of}} commercial blood donors and donors positive for hepatitis-B antigen (HBAg) resulted in a hepatitis frequency of only 3. 7 cases/ 1000 units transfused. Residual posttransfusion hepatitis was caused by at least two viruses. Four of 10 cases were short incubation, HBAg negative; six cases were long incubation, HBAg positive. One patient had both diseases in sequence. Some cases of HBAg-positive hepatitis occurred {{despite the fact that}} patients received only blood that was HBAg negative by counterelectrophoresis; current tests for HBAg, including radioimmunoassay, cannot detect all donors capable of transmitting HBAg-positive hepatitis. The presence of anti-HBAg in donor blood was common and did not correlate with posttransfusion hepatitis; donors with anti-HBAg should not be excluded. T H E FIRST of three prospective studies on posttrans-fusion hepatitis in open-heart surgery patients at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was initiated in 1965. That first study (1) demonstrated the risk of commercial blood; 50 % of multiply transfused patients who received primarily commercial blood developed <b>anicteric</b> or icteric <b>hepatitis.</b> The second study (2), begun in 1968, showed the risk. of re-ceiving blood contaminated with hepatitis-B antigen (HBAg, Au-SH antigen); 69 % of patients receiving at least one unit of HBAg-positive blood developed hepatitis, of which 50 % was icteric. In that second study, donor units were tested retrospectively for the presence of HBAg, whereas patients were fol-lowed prospectively for the development of hepatitis. The current study was begun in early 1970, when it became feasible to fulfill blood requirements solely from voluntary sources and to screen donor blood prospectively for HBAg. We report on the effect of the combined exclusion of commercial and HBAg-positive donors on the frequency and severity of post-transfusion hepatitis, from a study of 126 patients...|$|R
40|$|In July 2000, {{symptomatic}} {{acute hepatitis}} C was diagnosed in five {{patients who had}} attended the emergency room of a municipal hospital on the same day, about 6 weeks before. Investigation of the remaining 65 patients visited at the emergency room on that day disclosed that 8 patients had a positive anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) test and 4 of them had biochemical evidence of acute <b>anicteric</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> HCV RNA was detected in 12 of the 13 anti-HCV-positive patients. Phylogenetic analysis of the nonstructural 5 A (NS 5 A) and E 2 regions showed that 10 patients, including all 9 with acute hepatitis, were infected with a closely related HCV strain, while the remaining 2 patients harbored unrelated strains. Flushing of intravenous catheters with heparin retrieved from a multidose heparin solution in saline was carried out for all the patients involved in the hepatitis outbreak but in only 1 of 23 (4 %) matched controls recruited among HCV-noninfected patients attending the emergency room on the same day, {{and this was the}} only significant difference concerning risk factors for HCV infection between patients and controls.

MethodsChildren up to 12 years of age who had a fever {{for more than five}} days without an identifiable infection were included. All children who were suspected of having rickettsial infections were defined as having scrub typhus if they had a positive Weil-Felix test result (OX-K 1 : 80 or more) and {{one or more of the}} following clinical features (after exclusion of other diagnoses) : rash, edema, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, an eschar, and a tick bite or tick exposure. ResultsThirty-five children were diagnosed with scrub typhus between February 2010 and February 2011. The age of the patients ranged from 1. 5 to 12 years. Edema, crackles/rhonchi, hepatomegaly and hypotension were encountered in 60 %, 23 %, 91 % and 34 % of patients, respectively. An eschar was observed in 11 % of the cases. Complications included myocarditis with cardiogenic shock in 34 % of the cases and acute kidney injury in 20 % of the cases. <b>Anicteric</b> <b>hepatitis</b> and thrombocytopenia were observed in 31 % and 61 % of cases, respectively.

40|$|Australia antigen [Au(1) ], a {{particle}} associated with viral hepatitis, was {{isolated from the}} plasma of a patient with chronic <b>anicteric</b> <b>hepatitis</b> and leukemia who had received radioactive phosphorus. We {{have found that the}} immunoreactivity and appearance of Au(1) in the electron microscope were not altered by treatment with enzymes including trypsin, pronase, lipase, phospholipase C, ribonuclease, deoxyribonuclease, amylase, and neuraminidase. In contrast, other serum constituents were degraded by these enzymes. Therefore, treatment of the patient's plasma with many enzymes was exploited as an initial step for the isolation of Au(1). Subsequently, Au(1) was purified from the enzyme-treated 32 P-labeled plasma by gel filtration through Sephadex G- 200 and centrifugation through sucrose and in cesium chloride gradients. There were no detectable human serum components in the purest fractions, as tested by immunoelectrophoresis and immunodiffusion. The density of the purified Au(1) was 1. 21 in CsCl. The particle measured about 200 A in diameter, was predominantly spherical in shape and appeared to be composed of subunits. Nucleic acids were not detected by spectrophotometric, radiochemical, and chemical analyses. Immunoreactivity of purified Au(1) was destroyed by heating for 1 hr at 85 °C but was stable at 56 °C. Treatment with Carnoy's solution (3 parts ethanol: 1 part glacial acetic acid) followed by pronase disrupted the particles as seen with the electron microscope. These findings, combined with other published information on Australia antigen and viral hepatitis, suggest that the bulk of Australia antigen in the blood of this patient is an incomplete virus or virus capsid...|$|E
40|$|Sera from {{children}} with various clinical categories of hepatitis were examined for hepatitis B surface (HBs) antigen by radioimmunoassary and for HBs antibody by passive hemagglutination test. The subjects, {{a total of}} 106 cases, consisted of 56 cases of acute hepatitis, 4 cases of chronic hepatitis, 31 cases of neonatal hepatitis and 15 cases of <b>anicteric</b> <b>hepatitis</b> in early infancy. One hundred children under 15 years of age without a history and hepatic disease were included as the control. A seroepidemiologic survey was also carried out using 1131 sera from inhabitants in Sapporo City and Rishiri Island. The results obtained were summarized as follows; 1. Frequencies of the detection of HBs antigen and antibody in 56 cases of acute hepatitis were 55 % (31 / 56) and 11 % (6 / 56), respectively. Frequency of either the antigen or the antibody {{in the group of}} acute sporadic hepatitis without known parenteral exposure to blood or blood products was 74 % (28 / 38) which was higher than that of 44 % (8 / 18) in the group of post-transfusion hepatitis. All 4 patients with chronic hepatitis were found to have persistent IIBs antigenemia. The antigen, however, was detected in only 3 out of 100 serum specimens of the control group. These data suggest the importance of HB virus as an etiologic agent of acute and chronic hepatitis in children in this country. 2. From the results of a comparative study of clinical manifestations and laboratory findings between HBs positive and negative groups of acute hepatitis, the abnormal value of serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase was found to be more prolonged, but clinical manifestations such as fever or liver swelling were less remarkable in HBs positive group than in HBs negative group. Age distribution of HBs positive and negative groups of patients with acute sporadic hepatitis without history of blood transfusion was significantly different from each other. All but one of 22 patients over 6 years old belonged to HBs positive group, whereas 8 out of 16 patients under 6 years old belonged to HBs negative group. Accordingly, hepatitis A virus {{was supposed to be a}} more common agent responsible for acute hepatitis in younger children. 3. As for hepatitis in infants under 6 months old, HBs antigen was detected in 2 out of 31 cases of neonatal hepatitis and 2 out of 15 cases of <b>anicteric</b> <b>hepatitis.</b> One of 2 patients with HBs positive neonatal hepatitis took a fatal course after fulminant hepatitis, and another patient was a chronic hepatitis case. All of 4 HBs antigenemic patients with or without jaundice were born to mothers with chronic antigenemia, 3 or whom were considered to be healthy carriers. These data suggest that HB virus transmitted from carrier mothers are responsible for some cases of hepatitis in early infancy. In the majority of cases, however, other agents were assumed to be responsible for hepatitis of these categories. 4. HBs antibody was first detected in 15 % of a group of children from 3 to 5 years old in Rishiri Island and in 12 % of children from 6 to 9 years old in Sapporo City. The frequency increased gradually through school age and reached its maximum of 31 % and 45 % in the group of 20 years old in Sapporo and Rishiri, respectively. Thus, HB virus infections seem to be common in the childhood population in urban as well as rural areas of Hokkaido district...|$|E
40|$|Background & Aims: Hepatitis B virus {{reactivation}} is {{a serious}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients treated with chemotherapy. We compared the efficacy of early and deferred preemptive lamivudine therapy in reducing the incidence of hepatitis due to hepatitis B virus reactivation in hepatitis B surface antigen-positive lymphoma patients treated with chemotherapy. Methods: Thirty consecutive hepatitis B surface antigen-positive lymphoma patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy were randomized (1 : 1) to receive lamivudine 100 mg daily 1 week before chemotherapy (group 1) or to have this treatment deferred until there was serological evidence of hepatitis B virus reactivation on the basis of serial 2 -week-interval serum hepatitis B virus DNA monitoring by a Digene Hybrid Capture II assay (group 2). Results: Eight (53 %) patients in group 2 and none in group 1 had hepatitis B virus virological reactivation after chemotherapy (P = 0. 002). Seven patients in group 2 still had hepatitis (5 <b>anicteric</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> 1 icteric hepatitis, and 1 hepatic failure). Survival free from hepatitis due to hepatitis B virus reactivation in group 1 patients was significantly longer than that in group 2 (P = 0. 002 on the log-rank test). The median onset of hepatitis B virus reactivation in these patients was 16 weeks (range, 4 - 36 weeks) after the initiation of chemotherapy. Three (13 %) of the 23 patients treated with lamivudine had hepatitis B virus-related hepatitis after lamivudine withdrawal. Conclusions: Lamivudine should be considered preemptively before or at the initiation of chemotherapy for all hepatitis B surface antigen-positive lymphoma patients undergoing intense chemotherapy. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviewed}} the clinical characteristics and treatment outcome of 484 lymphoma patients with known hepatitis B status. Comparisons were {{made between the}} hepatitis B surface antigen positive and negative patients. Also, the effect of treatment for lymphomas, including cytotoxic chemotherapy, in the hepatitis B antigen positive patients were analysed. The hepatitis B status was determined in 484 Chinese lymphoma patients {{at the time of}} initial diagnosis. Hepatic complications occurring during therapy for lymphomas were analysed. Although our lymphoma patients had a similar prevalence of hepatitis B markers of 42 per cent, they had a strikingly higher positive rate of 22 per cent for hepatitis B surface antigen and a relatively lower positive rate of 20 per cent for antibody, as compared to the respective figures of 9. 5 per cent and 33 per cent in the control population. The hepatitis B surface antigen positive patients were younger than the negative patients but their treatment outcomes were similar despite the higher incidence of hepatic complications (21 per cent) in the hepatitis B surface antigen positive patients during therapy for lymphomas. None of the clinical parameters analysed appeared to be useful in predicting the development of these complications which included fatal liver failure (5. 7 per cent), icteric hepatitis (5. 7 per cent) and <b>anicteric</b> <b>hepatitis</b> (9. 5 per cent). The high prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen in our lymphoma patients {{may be related to the}} immunosuppressive effect of lymphomas. There is no definite evidence to suggest that hepatitis B infection has an aetiological or promoting role in the pathogenesis of lymphomas. Hepatitis B infection has contributed to the high incidence of hepatic complications during therapy for lymphomas and possible ways of prevention need to be investigated. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
