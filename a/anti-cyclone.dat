Cyclonic and anti-cyclonic convection vortices, which rotate, respectively, in the same and opposite directions of the system rotation, are generated and play a primary role in the magnetic field intensification. The magnetic field is enhanced through the stretching of magnetic lines of force in four particular places of the convection fields, namely, inside <b>anti-cyclones,</b> between cyclones and their western neighbouring <b>anti-cyclones</b> at middle as well as low latitudes, and between <b>anti-cyclones</b> and the outer boundary. A 2 ̆ 7 twist-turn 2 ̆ 7 loop of intense magnetic flux density is identified as a fundamental structure which yields the dominant contribution both to the toroidal and poloidal components of the longitudinal averaged magnetic field. Various types of competitive interaction between magnetic field and convection vortices are observed. Among others, a creation-and-annihilation cycle of them in the statistically equilibrium state is particularly important, which is composed of three sequentially recurrent dynamical processes, that is, the generation of convection vortices by the Rayleigh-Benard instability, the growth of <b>anti-cyclones</b> and the intensification of magnetic field by concentrate-and-stretch mechanism, and the break-down of vortices by the Lorentz force followed by diminution of magnetic field.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, we {{investigate}} the different impacts of El Niño and El Niño Modoki on China rainfall in their decaying phases. During spring, in the decaying year of El Niño events, there are positive rainfall anomalies {{south of the}} Yangtze River, whereas no obvious rainfall signals {{are found in the}} same season for the decaying El Niño Modoki. In the subsequent summer season, the wet signal south of the Yangtze River associated with El Niño continues, while suppressed rainfall now appears in the northern Yangtze–Huaihe River region. In contrast, the rainfall is above normal in the region from the Huaihe River to the Yellow River, and below normal in southern China during the summer of the decaying El Niño Modoki events. The distinct China rainfall anomaly is mainly attributed to the difference between the evolution and location of the anomalous western North Pacific (WNP) <b>anti-cyclone</b> associated with El Niño and El Niño Modoki events. For the case of El Niño, the WNP <b>anti-cyclone</b> brings plentiful moisture to southern China; meanwhile it shifts the ridge of sub-tropical high westward in both spring and summer.

MLS and TES observations of tropospheric O 3 during 2005 to 2009 reveal a distinct, persistent O 3 maximum, both in mixing ratio and tropospheric column, in May over the Equatorial Southern Indian Ocean (ESIO). The maximum is most pronounced in 2006 and 2008 and less evident in the other three years. This feature {{is also consistent with}} the total column O 3 observations from the Ozone Mapping Instrument (OMI) and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). Model results reproduce the observed May O 3 maximum and the associated interannual variability. The origin of the maximum reflects a complex interplay of chemical and dynamic factors. The O 3 maximum is dominated by the O 3 production driven by lightning nitrogen oxides (NO x) emissions, which accounts for 62 % of the tropospheric column O 3 in May 2006. We find the contribution from biomass burning, soil, anthropogenic and biogenic sources to the O 3 maximum are rather small. The O 3 productions in the lightning outflow from Central Africa and South America both peak in May and are directly responsible for the O 3 maximum over the western ESIO. The lightning outflow from Equatorial Asia dominates over the eastern ESIO. The interannual variability of the O 3 maximum is driven largely by the anomalous <b>anti-cyclones</b> over the southern Indian Ocean in May 2006 and 2008.

A linear stability analysis of the equilibrium motion is performed.

Under certain boundary conditions a linear analysis shows that a ring of sub-tropical <b>anti-cyclones</b> is stable, however a ring of cyclones would be unstable. This result is due to the variation of Coriolis force with latitude over the surface of a sphere. The “p-plane” effect induces a rotation of a ring of anticyclones, but opposing the direction of rota-tion of a ring of cyclones. Unless the strength of the cyclonic vorticity is very strong, this effect causes instability in the system of cyclones. The arguments show that in the atmosphere an anticyclone system can exist at subtropical latitudes, whereas cyclonic vorticity will be confined to the polar regions.
