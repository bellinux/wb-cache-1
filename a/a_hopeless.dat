5|$|Murray {{skipped the}} World Group 1st round tie against Argentina, over fears he could {{exacerbate}} a knee injury, leaving the British team in <b>a</b> <b>hopeless</b> situation – they lost 4–1. Jamie was furious that Andy was letting {{them down and}} the Murrays would not {{speak to each other}} for two weeks. Seven months later, as the brothers prepared for the tie against Austria, Andy declared that he had healed the rift with Jamie. When Jamie Murray and Ross Hutchins were beaten in the doubles, John Lloyd suffered criticism for not playing Andy. Great Britain lost their World Group play-off to Austria 3–2 and were relegated to Europe/Africa Zone Group I.|$|E
5|$|Notwithstanding {{his other}} actions, Peckham's {{relations}} with the king were generally good, and Edward sent him on a diplomatic mission to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in Wales. In 1282 he attempted to mediate between the Welsh and King Edward, but given that Edward would not budge on the main issues, it was <b>a</b> <b>hopeless</b> mission. In the end, Peckham excommunicated some of the Welsh who were resisting Edward, not unsurprising given Peckham's views of the Welsh. Peckham visited the Welsh dioceses {{as part of his}} tour of all his subordinate dioceses. While there, Peckham criticised the Welsh clergy for their unchaste lives, conspicuous consumption, and heavy drinking. He also found the Welsh clergy to be uneducated, although he did order a Welsh-speaking suffragan bishop to be appointed to help with pastoral duties in the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield. Peckham also criticised the Welsh people as a whole, contrasting their pastoral economy with the farming-based economy of England, and finding the Welsh to be lazy and idle.|$|E
5|$|Seydlitz {{rejoined the}} King in 1758 and on 25 August, at the Battle of Zorndorf, Seydlitz's cavalry again secured the victory. He led thirty-six squadrons into {{a mass of}} Russian cavalry mingled with infantry. This charge broke the Russian right wing and sent them running for the woods. At the Prussian debacle at Hochkirch, on 14 October 1758, he covered the Prussian retreat with 108 squadrons, and in the {{disaster}} of Kunersdorf, on 12 August 1759, he received another severe wound in <b>a</b> <b>hopeless</b> attempt to storm a hill held by the Russians; his 8th Cuirassiers {{was one of the}} few intact regiments at the end of the battle. While recuperating in Berlin, he helped organize a defense of the city during the Austro-Russian raid (October 1760). Although he was unable to prevent the Russians from briefly occupying the city, Frederick later praised Seydlitz for his conduct.|$|E

Often Morgan's young daughter, Mary, comes to beg her father to return home. One day, she appears during a fight {{between the two men}} and is fatally struck by a bottle thrown by the saloon-keeper.

The film was released on November 4, 1910 and met with mixed reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

25|$|The stories {{featuring}} the Ankh-Morpork City Watch are urban-set, and frequently show the clashes that result when a traditional, magically run fantasy world {{such as the}} Disc comes into contact with modern technology and civilization. They revolve around {{the growth of the}} Ankh-Morpork City Watch from <b>a</b> <b>hopeless</b> gang of three to a fully equipped and efficient police force. The stories are largely police procedurals, featuring crimes that have heavy political or societal overtones.|$|E

She wed George Tuttle Brokaw, millionaire heir to a New York clothing fortune, on August 10, 1923, {{at the age of}} 20. They had one daughter, Ann Clare Brokaw (August 22, 1924 – January 11, 1944).

25|$|Transsexual {{individuals}} may grieve due to evolving sex characteristics {{that does not}} conform to {{the identity of the}} individual. The grief may be contributed by a loss of an existent gender-neutral identity. Also it may contributed by <b>a</b> <b>hopeless</b> long for an opposite sex characteristic that may already have been evolved into a permanently irreversible state in a non-desired direction. For example, deepening of the voice for a trans woman or not having the desired genitals.|$|E

25|$|The Battle of Cold Harbor {{was fought}} from May 31 to June 12, 1864, {{with the most}} {{significant}} fighting occurring on June 3. It {{was one of the}} final battles of Union Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant's Overland Campaign during the American Civil War, and is remembered as one of American history's bloodiest, most lopsided battles. Thousands of Union soldiers were killed or wounded in <b>a</b> <b>hopeless</b> frontal assault against the fortified positions of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's army.|$|E

Since he had little support in the Assembly, his government had no prospect of long-term survival. Following the resolution of the Darling grant crisis, he stepped down in July, and in September he retired from the Council.|$|E

25|$|Violation of the {{principle}} of locality, which contradicts special relativity: MWI splitting is instant and total: this may conflict with relativity, since an alien in the Andromeda galaxy can't know I collapse an electron over here before she collapses hers there: the relativity of simultaneity says we can't say which electron collapsed first – so which one splits off another universe first? This leads to <b>a</b> <b>hopeless</b> muddle with everyone splitting differently. Note: EPR is not a get-out here, as the alien's and my electrons need never {{have been part of the}} same quantum, i.e., entangled.|$|E

Francon goes to Roark's apartment and offers to marry him if he gives up architecture to save himself from <b>a</b> <b>hopeless</b> struggle. Roark rejects her fears and says that they face many years apart until she adjusts her thinking.|$|E

25|$|As {{minister}} for War, he {{became involved in}} disputes with Foreign Secretary George Canning over the Walcheren Expedition and its failure. Canning {{saw it as a}} diversion of troops from the Peninsular War based on <b>a</b> <b>hopeless</b> plan. However, Castlereagh had the support of Lord Wellesley's younger brother General Arthur Wellesley (future Duke of Wellington), and evidence later surfaced that Canning himself had interfered with the plan, selecting the Earl of Chatham to command the expedition. The Portland government became increasingly paralysed by disputes between the two men. Portland was in deteriorating health and gave no lead, until Canning threatened resignation unless Castlereagh was removed and replaced by Lord Wellesley. Wellesley himself was neither complicit with nor even aware of the arrangement, but Portland secretly agreed to make this change when it became possible.|$|E
25|$|The {{motivation}} for this violent rejection {{of his earlier}} self {{is the subject of}} considerable speculation. From the time of his arrival in Paris, Modigliani consciously crafted a charade persona for himself and cultivated his reputation as <b>a</b> <b>hopeless</b> drunk and voracious drug user. His escalating intake of drugs and alcohol may have been a means by which Modigliani masked his tuberculosis from his acquaintances, few of whom knew of his condition. Tuberculosis—the leading cause of death in France by 1900—was highly communicable, there was no cure, and those who had it were feared, ostracized, and pitied. Modigliani thrived on camaraderie and would not let himself be isolated as an invalid; he used drink and drugs as palliatives to ease his physical pain, helping him to maintain a façade of vitality and allowing him to continue to create his art.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan Forces General Headquarters had {{declined}} to provide a substantial naval contingent {{for the defense of}} East Pakistan, for two reasons. First, they had an inadequate number of ships to challenge the Indian navy on both fronts. Second, the PAF in the east was not deemed strong enough to protect the ships from Indian airpower (i.e. both the IAF and the Indian Navy air arm). The fate of Pakistani naval vessels in December was ample proof of the soundness of this decision, and the repercussions of neglecting East Pakistan defense infrastructure, which was the reason the PAF could only station 1 squadron of planes there. Pakistan Eastern Command had planned to fight the war without the Navy, and faced with <b>a</b> <b>hopeless</b> task against overwhelming odds, the Navy planned to remain in port when war broke out.|$|E
