50|$|Tiaprofenic acid is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) of the <b>arylpropionic</b> <b>acid</b> (profen) class, used {{to treat}} pain, especially arthritic pain. The typical adult dose is 300 mg twice daily. It is not recommended in children.|$|R

5000|$|The isoindolone {{ring system}} forms the nucleus {{for one of}} the more {{traditional}} [...] "profen" [...] NSAIDs.Reduction of the nitro group in <b>arylpropionic</b> <b>acid</b> (1) gives the corresponding aniline (2). Reaction of the intermediate with the imide (3) from phthalic anhydride (ie. phthalimide) gives the product (4) in which the aniline nitrogen has exchanged with ammonia (apparently phthalic anhydride was not used directly). Treatment of the new imide with zinc in acetic acid leads, interestingly to reduction of but one of the carbonyl groups to afford indolone, indoprofen.|$|R
50|$|At {{proposed}} therapeutic concentrations, this molecule lacks anti-inflammatory activity, {{and does}} not inhibit either cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) or cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) enzymes. Only the S-enantiomers of <b>arylpropionic</b> <b>acid</b> NSAID can potently inhibit COX, whereas the R-enantiomers exert almost no COX activity. R-Flurbiprofen is inefficiently converted into S-flurbiprofen, with 1.5% of the R-enantiomer undergoing bioinversion to the S-form. Although this compound lacks activity against COX, {{studies have shown that}} this drug is a potent reducer of levels of beta amyloid, the main constituent of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease, and therefore there was interest in this drug as a therapeutic agent.|$|R

40|$|Aldo-keto reductase 1 C 3 (AKR 1 C 3) catalyses the NADPH {{dependent}} {{reduction of}} carbonyl {{groups in a}} number of important steroid and prostanoid molecules. The enzyme is also over-expressed in prostate and breast cancer and its expression is correlated with the aggressiveness of the disease. The steroid products of AKR 1 C 3 catalysis are important in proliferative signalling of hormone-responsive cells, while the prostanoid products promote prostaglandin-dependent proliferative pathways. In these ways, AKR 1 C 3 contributes to tumour development and maintenance, and suggest that inhibition of AKR 1 C 3 activity is an attractive target for the development of new anti-cancer therapies. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one well-known class of compounds that inhibits AKR 1 C 3, yet crystal structures have only been determined for this enzyme with flufenamic acid, indomethacin, and closely related analogues bound. While the flufenamic acid and indomethacin structures have been used to design novel inhibitors, they provide only limited coverage of the NSAIDs that inhibit AKR 1 C 3 and that may be used for the development of new AKR 1 C 3 targeted drugs. To understand how other NSAIDs bind to AKR 1 C 3, we have determined ten crystal structures of AKR 1 C 3 complexes that cover three different classes of NSAID, N-phenylanthranilic acids (meclofenamic <b>acid,</b> mefenamic <b>acid),</b> <b>arylpropionic</b> <b>acids</b> (flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, naproxen), and indomethacin analogues (indomethacin, sulindac, zomepirac).
