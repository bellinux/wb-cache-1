25|$|The BSA {{requires}} {{financial institutions}} {{to engage in}} customer due diligence, or KYC, which is sometimes known in the parlance as know your customer. This includes obtaining satisfactory identification to give assurance that the account is in the customer's true name, and having {{an understanding of the}} expected nature and source of the money that flows through the customer's accounts. Other classes of customers, such as those with private banking accounts and those of foreign government officials, are subjected to enhanced due diligence because the law deems that those types of accounts are a higher risk for money laundering. All accounts are subject to ongoing monitoring, in which internal bank software scrutinizes transactions and flags for manual inspection those that fall outside certain parameters. If a manual inspection reveals that the transaction is suspicious, the institution should file a Suspicious <b>Activity</b> <b>Report.</b>|$|E
25|$|Very {{soon after}} arrival over the Sea of Japan (East Sea of Korea), at 10:35., North Korea {{reacted to the}} {{presence}} of the EC-121, but not {{in a way that would}} jeopardize the mission. At 12:34 local time, roughly six hours into the mission, the Army Security Agency and radars in Korea detected the takeoff of two North Korean Air Force MiG-21s from East Tongchong-ni near Wonsan and tracked them, assuming that they were responding in some fashion to the mission of Deep Sea 129. In the meantime the EC-121 filed a scheduled <b>activity</b> <b>report</b> by radio on time at 13:00 and did not indicate anything out of the ordinary, but this was the last message sent from the plane. Twenty-two minutes later the radars lost the picture of the MiGs and did not reacquire it until 13:37, where they were closing with Deep Sea 129 for a probable intercept.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to prevent dirty money from {{entering}} the U.S. financial system in the first place, the United States Congress passed a series of laws, starting in 1970, collectively known as the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). These laws, contained in sections 5311 through 5332 of Title 31 of the United States Code, require financial institutions, which under the current definition include {{a broad array of}} entities, including banks, credit card companies, life insurers, money service businesses and broker-dealers in securities, to report certain transactions to the United States Department of the Treasury. Cash transactions in excess of a certain amount must be reported on a currency transaction report (CTR), identifying the individual making the transaction as well as the source of the cash. The law originally required all transactions of US$5,000 or more to be reported, but due to excessively high levels of reporting the threshold was raised to US$10,000. [...] The U.S. {{is one of the few}} countries in the world to require reporting of all cash transactions over a certain limit, although certain businesses can be exempt from the requirement. Additionally, financial institutions must report transaction on a Suspicious <b>Activity</b> <b>Report</b> (SAR) that they deem [...] "suspicious", defined as a knowing or suspecting that the funds come from illegal activity or disguise funds from illegal activity, that it is structured to evade BSA requirements or appears to serve no known business or apparent lawful purpose; or that the institution is being used to facilitate criminal activity. Attempts by customers to circumvent the BSA, generally by structuring cash deposits to amounts lower than US$10,000 by breaking them up and depositing them on different days or at different locations also violates the law......|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of virtual currencies {{in the past}} decade, and particularly the popularity of Bitcoin, has raised concerns that such technologies may be utilised by criminals {{for the purposes of}} money laundering. Recent guidance from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has suggested applying anti-money laundering legislation (AML) to virtual currencies, specifically suspicious <b>activity</b> <b>reporting</b> requirements. This paper seeks to explain what virtual currencies are, and demonstrate the difficulties in applying AML, and specifically suspicious <b>activity</b> <b>reporting</b> requirements, to virtual currency transactions. The argument proposed is that suspicious <b>activity</b> <b>reporting</b> is not compatible with virtual currencies, specifically due to the absence of human interaction with virtual currency transactions. In achieving this aim the stages of money laundering will be outlined, and a hypothetical example of money laundering through ‘traditional’ methods will be compared money laundering through virtual currencies. The guidance of the FATF will be considered, alongside the responses of the United States, the EU and the UK. The suspicious <b>activity</b> <b>reporting</b> regime of the UK will be applied to virtual currencies and as such the pitfalls will be identified and potential solutions will be considered...|$|R
