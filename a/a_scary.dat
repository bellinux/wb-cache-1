5|$|However, {{the game}} often {{considered}} the first true survival horror, due {{to having the}} most influence on Resident Evil, was the 1989 release Sweet Home, for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was created by Tokuro Fujiwara, who would later go on to create Resident Evil. Sweet Homes gameplay focused on solving a variety of puzzles using items stored in a limited inventory, while battling or escaping from horrifying creatures, {{which could lead to}} permanent death for any of the characters, thus creating tension and an emphasis on survival. It was also the first attempt at creating <b>a</b> <b>scary</b> and frightening storyline within a game, mainly told through scattered diary entries left behind fifty years before the events of the game. Developed by Capcom, the game would become the main inspiration behind their later release Resident Evil. Its horrific imagery prevented its release in the Western world, though its influence was felt through Resident Evil, which was originally intended to be a remake of the game. Some consider Sweet Home to be the first true survival horror game.|$|E

25|$|Staal {{continued}} his strong {{play into the}} lock-out-shortened 2012–13, averaging over 0.5 points per game {{for the first time}} in his career in his first 21 games. However, during a game against the Philadelphia Flyers, in New York, on March 5, 2013, Staal suffered <b>a</b> <b>scary</b> eye injury. A slap-shot by Flyers defenceman Kimmo Timonen was deflected by Flyer forward Jakub Voráček into Staal's right eye, sending him to the ice. After the game, it was concluded that Staal suffered a small retinal tear in his right eye and an orbital fracture. The injury effectively ended his season, as he only played in one game the rest of the year, in the first round of the playoffs, before pulling himself from the line-up again. When he returned, he wore a visor {{for the first time in}} his career due to the nature of the injury.|$|E
25|$|Callum, who was {{battling for}} custody over Max, {{attacked}} David and the Platt family for months {{until one day}} when, after the Platt's return from a week-long holiday, Sarah Platt was babysitting Max. Whilst they were watching <b>a</b> <b>scary</b> movie, Gemma Winter, Callum's friend, came {{knocking at the door}} of Callum's flat. She had been beaten up by a thug. When Max was playing in his room, he found Callum's gun. Callum threatened Sarah that if she told anyone about the gun then he would release a video of Bethany dealing and taking drugs to the police. Sarah flees with Max, refused to speak to anyone about it and told Bethany to stay away from him. However, he continued threatening the Platts. Sarah confided in Jason Grimshaw to finish him off. He attacked Callum in the Rovers and told him to stay away. He was then arrested for possession of the gun but was released without charge due to lack of evidence. When Callum arrived at the Platts' house to collect Max, David and Jason prevented him. Furious, Callum and two of his thugs lead Jason into the ginnel and beat him up. Sarah found Jason and called an ambulance. Jason's parents Eileen and Tony were told that he might not walk or talk again. Max, who had witnessed the attack on Jason, told David and Kylie what he saw after he appeared terrified when Callum came to collect him. Max gave a statement to the police. Before Callum was arrested, he spiked Sarah's drink and knocked her unconscious. He threatened Bethany that he would kill Sarah if she did not lie for him. The day after, on Lily Platt's 2nd birthday, Bethany revealed to the Platts that she made a statement against Max. The family was disgusted as they knew she was lying. Sarah informed Tony about Callum and the following day, he took matters into his own hands by beating up Callum in the ginnel, only to be stopped by Liz. Callum continued to attack the Platts because he needed money to pay off a dangerous drug dealer. Sarah lures him to the house and records what he is saying. Callum finds her 'phone and starts attacking Sarah, and Kylie comes in and beats him over the head with a wrench, killing him. They bury his body in a manhole in the garage and Sarah is traumatized.|$|E

500|$|When You Reach Me {{takes place}} during the 1978-1979 school year of Miranda, the main character. Stead placed Miranda's home in the Upper West Side, New York City, where Stead grew up. Many parts of the novel explore [...] "the same streets where Stead grew up, and riffs on some of her experiences". Stead was {{inspired}} to use this setting because she moved into an apartment near her childhood home early {{in the development of}} the story. There she had experienced her first independence while exploring the streets, only to find <b>a</b> <b>scary</b> man near her house.

500|$|The {{surprise}} {{appearance of}} the Flood during Halo: Combat Evolved {{was seen as an}} important plot twist and <b>a</b> <b>scary</b> moment even after repeat playing of the game. Gamasutra, writing about video game plots, gives the example of the Flood not only as an important reversal to the story of Halo, but a textbook example of how games and their stories are made more interesting by twists in the plot. Mark Binelli of Rolling Stone credited the {{appearance of the}} Flood as an excellent way to keep players on their toes by forcing them to adjust their strategies, as well as being a twist as radical [...] "as if, several levels into a game of Pac-Man, the dots suddenly began to attack you".|$|E

500|$|... "Hide" [...] was {{the first}} {{contribution}} to Doctor Who of writer Neil Cross, who was {{a fan of the}} show but had never had the time to write an episode. Cross wanted to write <b>a</b> <b>scary</b> episode and was inspired by Nigel Kneale's works The Quatermass Experiment and The Stone Tape. The storyline of [...] "Hide" [...] was kept to a restricted setting and characters, although it was expanded thematically to flesh out the monster with a love story that paralleled that of Professor Palmer and Emma. The first to be filmed for {{the second half of the}} series— predating Coleman's introduction as full-time companion in the Christmas special— [...] "Hide" [...] began filming in late May 2012 at Margam Country Park, Gethin Forest, and a National Trust property at Tyntesfield.

500|$|In the episode, Homer builds <b>a</b> <b>scary</b> clown-shaped bed for Bart. The {{scene was}} {{inspired}} by Mike Reiss, whose dad had built him a clown-shaped bed when he was younger, and just like Bart, Reiss was scared of sleeping in it. As the flashback begins in 1983, a young Homer strolls down the street, singing Cyndi Lauper's song [...] "Girls Just Want to Have Fun", which was released the same year. The idea for this sequence came from animation director Chuck Sheetz, who suggested it because {{the length of the}} final version of the episode was too short. The Fox censors wrote a note concerning Homer's line, [...] "Bart can kiss my hairy, yellow butt!" [...] after Marge tells Homer that Bart might be jealous of baby Lisa, citing that the line is considered [...] "coarse", due to the fact that Bart was two during the flashback.|$|E

500|$|While {{studying}} cinema at the University of Southern California, Dan O'Bannon {{had made}} a science-fiction comedy film, Dark Star, with director John Carpenter and concept artist Ron Cobb. The film featured an alien created by spray-painting a beach ball; the experience left O'Bannon [...] "really wanting to do an alien that looked real." [...] A [...] "couple of years" [...] later he began work on a similar story that would focus more on horror. [...] "I knew I wanted to do <b>a</b> <b>scary</b> movie on a spaceship with {{a small number of}} astronauts", he later recalled, [...] "Dark Star as a horror movie instead of a comedy." [...] Ronald Shusett, meanwhile, was working on an early version of what would eventually become Total Recall. Impressed by Dark Star, he contacted O'Bannon and the two agreed to collaborate on their projects, choosing to work on O'Bannon's film first as they believed it would be less costly to produce.|$|E
500|$|... "Shivers" [...] {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} {{and became a}} major underground success in Australia, bringing more national attention to the band. Nick Cave cited it in hindsight as {{the main reason for}} the Boys Next Door's eminence. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, critic Will Lerner wrote that [...] "it's impressive how, even at this early stage, Nick Cave was a confident and unique singer, perfectly aware of the strengths and limitations of his voice … he knows how to come across in <b>a</b> <b>scary</b> and theatrical manner that perfectly complements the music. Nowhere is this more apparent than on … 'Shivers', an unashamedly melodramatic example of post-adolescent anguish". [...] "Shivers", along with other songs Howard composed, were [...] "crucial to guiding the band in the darker, wilder direction" [...] that defined the Birthday Party's music, according to Dan Lawrence of Stereogum. The song has since been considered an Australian classic and labelled by ABC Television as [...] "possibly Australia's most enduring cult hit".|$|E

Lead designer Craig Hubbard stated in an interview that [...] "horror is extremely fragile ... you can kill it by spelling things out too clearly and you can undermine it with too much ambiguity". He remarked that he attempted to strike a balance with the narrative elements of F.E.A.R., to give players [...] "enough clues so that [...] can form [...] own theories about what's going on, but ideally [...] be left with some uncertainty". Lead level designer John Mulkey stated, [...] "Creating expectation and then messing with that expectation is extremely important, predictability ruins <b>a</b> <b>scary</b> mood".|$|E
