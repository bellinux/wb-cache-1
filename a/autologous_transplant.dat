We aimed at comparing the disease-free survival of children with acute myeloid leukaemia who, {{in addition to being}} treated with the Latin American protocol of chemotherapy and an <b>autologous</b> <b>transplant,</b> either underwent early intensified chemotherapy or did not undergo such treatment. Procedure. This was a cohort study with a historical control group, forty patients, less than 16 years old. Group A (20 patients), diagnosed in the period 2005 – 2007, was treated with the Latin American protocol of chemotherapy with an <b>autologous</b> <b>transplant</b> plus early intensified chemotherapy: high doses of cytarabine and mitoxantrone. Group B (20 patients), diagnosed in the period 1999 – 2004, was treated as Group A, but without the early intensified chemotherapy. Results. Relapse-free survival for Group A was 90 % whereas that for Group B it was 60 % (P= 0. 041). Overall survival for Group A (18, 90 %) was higher than that for Group B (60 %).

40|$|Simultaneous {{autologous}} and homologous musculofascial transplants {{were made}} in New Zealand white rabbits. The basic pattern of degeneration and granulation tissue organization of both types of transplant was essentially identical. The superposition of two reactions {{in the framework of}} organizing granulation tissue served to distinguish homologous from <b>autologous</b> <b>transplants.</b> One reaction to homologous transplants was predominantly characterized by lymphocytic infiltration and the other by angeitis. The principal locus of these reactions was in the musculofascial zone of the transplant, and from this zone the reactions spread to a variable degree through the fascia into the overlying pannus of granulation tissue. When single homologous transplants were made, the lymphocytic and mild angeitic forms of reaction predominated, becoming conspicuous at the end of 2 weeks. When multiple successive homologous transplants were made from the same donor to the same recipient, acute angeitis with thrombosis supervened and the lymphocytic reaction failed to develop or persist. Multiple successive <b>autologous</b> <b>transplants,</b> on the other hand, did not influence the type or degree of reaction to <b>autologous</b> <b>transplants</b> in the same animal.

40|$|Multiple myeloma is {{an incurable}} {{malignancy}} of plasma B-cells. Traditional chemotherapeutic regimes often induce initial tumor regression; however, virtually all patients eventually succumb to relapse caused by either reintroduction of disease during <b>autologous</b> <b>transplant</b> or expansion of chemotherapy resistant minimal residual disease. It {{has been previously}} demonstrated that an oncolytic virus known as myxoma can completely prevent myeloma relapse caused by reintroduction of malignant cells during <b>autologous</b> <b>transplant.</b> The ability of this virus to treat established residual disease in vivo, however, remained unknown. Here we demonstrate that intravenous administration of myxoma virus into mice bearing disseminated myeloma results in the elimination of 70 – 90 % of malignant cells within 24 hours. This rapid debulking was dependent on direct contact of myxoma virus with residual myeloma and did not occur through destruction of the hematopoietic bone marrow niche. Importantly, systemic myxoma therapy also induced potent antimyeloma CD 8 + T cell responses which localized to the bone marrow and were capable of completely eradicating established myeloma in some animals. These results demonstrate that oncolytic myxoma virus is not only effective at preventing relapse caused by reinfusion of tumor cells during stem cell transplant, but is also potentially curative for patients bearing established minimal residual disease...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe use of {{high-dose}} chemotherapy with autologous {{support of}} hematopoietic progenitor cells {{is an effective}} strategy to treat various hematologic neoplasms, such as non-Hodgkin lymphomas and multiple myeloma. Mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells are {{the main source of}} support for autologous transplants, and collection of an adequate number of hematopoietic progenitor cells is a critical step in the <b>autologous</b> <b>transplant</b> procedure. Traditional strategies, based on the use of growth factors with or without chemotherapy, have limitations even when remobilizations are performed. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is the most widely used agent for progenitor cell mobilization. The association of plerixafor, a C-X-C Chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR 4) inhibitor, to granulocyte colony stimulating factor generates rapid mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells. A literature review was performed of randomized studies comparing different mobilization schemes in the treatment of multiple myeloma and lymphomas to analyze their limitations and effectiveness in hematopoietic progenitor cell mobilization for <b>autologous</b> <b>transplant.</b> This analysis showed that the addition of plerixafor to granulocyte colony stimulating factor is well tolerated and results in a greater proportion of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphomas or multiple myeloma reaching optimal CD 34 + cell collections with a smaller number of apheresis compared the use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor alone...|$|E

Cylindrical cartilage-subchondral bone defects were created in the right femoral knee joint of each sheep. The subchondral bone defects were implanted with hydroxyapatite-β-tricalcium phosphate (HA-TCP), poly lactic-glycolic acid (PLGA) -HA-TCP dual-layered composite scaffolds (PLGA/HA-TCP scaffolds), or autologous bone chips. The autologous cartilage layer was placed on top of the subchondral materials. After three months, the effect of different subchondral scaffolds on the repair of <b>autologous</b> cartilage <b>transplant</b> was systematically studied by investigating the mechanical strength, structural integration and histological responses. The results showed that the transplanted cartilage layer supported by HA-TCP scaffolds had better structural integration and higher mechanical strength than that supported by PLGA/HA-TCP scaffolds.

The functions of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal/thyroid/adrenal/somatotroph axis were evaluated. RESULTS: Three months after the transplant, insulin-like growth factor- 1 values were below the normal range in 53 patients (56 %); 37 of 40 women (93 %) of reproductive age experienced precocious ovarian failure; 39 of 46 men (85 %) showed high follicular stimulating hormone, and 17 men (37 %) showed low testosterone levels. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 28 patients (30 %) during the peritransplant period after corticosteroid withdrawal. Transient subclinical hyperthyroidism was found in 15 patients (16 %). Transient "low T(3) " syndrome was revealed in 29 patients (31 %). Twelve months after the transplant, insulin-like growth factor- 1 values were still low in 36 patients (38 %).
