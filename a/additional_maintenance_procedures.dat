40|$|Quest Diagnostics has {{committed}} to reducing operating expenses by $ 1. 3 B between 2012 and 2017. A portion of the cost-saving initiative focuses on reagents - expensive liquids that are combined with patient samples to detect compounds of interest. This project aims to reduce reagent waste for high-volume diagnostic tests run on an instrument platform that generates a relatively high amount of reagent waste. Waste, in this context, means any reagent that does not generate unique patient results. Therefore critical components of the quality system, such as quality control and calibration tests, are designated waste {{even though they are}} a necessary expenditure. Quality control (QC) samples and mechanical errors accounted for 5. 2 % and 4. 4 %, respectively, of all reagent usage {{prior to the start of}} the project. Mechanical errors occur when the diagnostic testing platform encounters something unexpected, such as debris or a reading that indicates insufficient sample volume, which interrupts sample processing. The instrument jettisons this test and attempts to repeat the assay. Initial discussions with laboratory representatives revealed differing interpretations of quality control requirements. All sites using the platform of interest were then surveyed to gauge the extent of variation. All sites met quality control requirements but several exceeded them. The most pertinent variations are listed below. 1. Frequency: Several sites ran control samples more often than established in Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) requirements, increasing total QC usage by over 70 %. 2. Container size: The choice of container determines the amount of "dead volume", material that the instrument cannot access and must be discarded. Some sites used containers with 12. 8 times the dead volume required in the smallest option. 3. Reuse policy: Some labs reuse containers of quality control materials across multiple batches. Reusing QC material further reduces the amount of dead volume discarded, but using new QC materials eliminates the possibility of evaporation between batches. An interdisciplinary team of experts tasked with maintaining the SOPs has reviewed these results and will clarify the appropriate SOP interpretation to unify practices across laboratories. In order to understand mechanical errors, I observed routine maintenance at four sites and found that business units did not consistently share best practices. Collaborating with vendor representatives and operators, I launched an Autonomous Maintenance (AM) pilot program in order to develop training materials capturing institutional knowledge and to test <b>additional</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedures.</b> The AM activities generated 29 training documents, which were added to a national database of competency training materials. All operators certified to operate the testing platform will be required to review and pass comprehension quizzes on the training materials. As the Marlborough site continues to develop improvements to the maintenance procedures, these changes will be shared with the vendor and incorporated into training documents. by Amy Rose Gobel.

Personnel matters, problem specification and identification, <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedures,</b> health and safety issues, and quality control issues {{are discussed}} in terms of their influence in effectively carrying out required maintenance. The work described in the thesis demonstrates that several research methods are applicable to, and effective for, gathering information on avionics systems maintenance. Evidence is presented to support the view that research of <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedures</b> can produce considerable benefits in terms of improved overall maintenance performance. A critical comparison of <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedures</b> used by British Aerospace and the Indonesian Air Force is included, and conclusions are drawn which highlight a number of significant possibilities for developing improved procedures. Specific recommendations for improving maintenance productivity are given, and the benefits of addressing issues of Continuing Professional Development, Health and Safety matters, problem identification, use of computer databases, particularly for information governed by Standards, are discussed...|$|R

40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Effective {{dewatering}} and refrigeration {{are crucial}} in mining. Cascading dewatering systems, which {{are common in}} deep gold mines, are very energy intensive. These systems present several opportunities for energy cost savings initiatives. Due to rising costs in the gold-mining industry and the stagnant gold price, these initiatives need to be sustained. Maintenance is therefore required on several sections to ensure sustainability. The literature study in this dissertation investigates the major sections affected by maintenance. Detailed investigations highlight problems that affect project performance negatively. These investigations, together with the literature study, were {{used to create a}} <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedure.</b> The focus of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedure</b> is on identifying problems and presenting recommended solutions. The new <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedure</b> is divided into four sections: data loss, mechanical, control and instrumentation, and control parameters. Data loss can be rectified by retrieving data and addressing the cause of the issue. Mechanical problems are fixed by following equipment-specific procedures. Control and instrumentation is divided into software, communication and instrumentation subsections. Each of these categories present several steps to deliver feasible solutions. The control parameters section consists of subsections relating to constraints, preferences and feedback. The new <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedure</b> ensures that the system is effectively controlled within all constraints – thereby sustaining energy cost savings measures. All the procedures use continued feedback to ensure project sustainability and client satisfaction. The impact of the new <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedure</b> was tested using three case studies. The results proved that structured maintenance helps to maintain sustainable energy cost savings. The combined target impact for the three case studies was an average evening peak load shift of 8. 39 MW. The combined average impact achieved during the selected twelve months was 10. 16 MW, which resulted in an approximate cost saving of R 8. 05 million. The significant savings sustained confirm the importance of the new <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedure.</b> Master...|$|R

40|$|We {{have begun}} {{work on an}} {{intelligent}} support tool (SMART) for operating and <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedures.</b> This work extends McDonnell Douglas's recent success in developing electronic job aids for onboard applications. SMART is based on advanced AI technology that derives the sequential, situational, operational, and temporal views of operating and <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedures</b> from a single internal representation of the procedures. SMART guides the astronauts through detailed operating and <b>maintenance</b> <b>procedures.</b> It also helps the astronauts decide when {{and how it is}} safe to deviate from the established procedures. SMART's user interface presents the sequential and procedural views of the procedures to the astronauts. The views are supplemented with vivid color graphics of internal system functions, digitized photographs of flight hardware, and full-motion video. SMART also allows the astronauts to keep their own personal notes attached to a procedure. SMART will be delivered on portable hand-held systems.
