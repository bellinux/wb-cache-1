25|$|A verse {{narrative}}, as {{one might}} expect, is simply a narrative poem, <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> <b>that</b> tells a story. What is interesting about this subgenre is that owing to {{its place in the}} flexible category of long poem, the verse-narrative may have disrupted convention by telling its story in both poem and narrative. This combination broadens the scope of both genres, lending the poem's depth that may be lacking in the other subgenres, yet also a lyrical voice that defines it as poetry. For an example of this, one might turn to Gilgamesh, which encompasses both the subgenres Epic and Verse-Narrative.|$|E
25|$|In 1730, Duck {{combined}} some of {{the poetic}} pieces he had been writing and wrote The Thresher's Labour, <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> <b>that</b> described the difficulty of field work. The poem was celebrated throughout London society, and he soon wrote The Shunammite, which reflected Duck's piety and religious imagination. The poet was taken to meet Queen Caroline, and, while he was there, word came {{of the death of}} his wife, but Clarke kept the news from Duck until after the interview with the Queen. For her part, she was pleased and gave Duck an annuity and a small house.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} give his account of Atlantis verisimilitude, Plato {{mentions}} that the story was heard by Solon in Egypt, and transmitted orally over several generations through the family of Dropides, until it reached Critias, a dialogue speaker in Timaeus and Critias. Solon had supposedly tried to adapt the Atlantis oral tradition into <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> (<b>that</b> if published, was to be greater than the works of Hesiod and Homer). While it was never completed, Solon passed on the story to Dropides. Modern classicists deny the existence of Solon's Atlantis poem and the story as an oral tradition. Instead, Plato {{is thought to be}} the sole inventor or fabricator.|$|E
25|$|Hesiod {{mentions}} {{a poetry}} contest at Chalcis in Euboea where {{the sons of}} one Amphidamas awarded him a tripod (Works and Days 654–662). Plutarch identified this Amphidamas with {{the hero of the}} Lelantine War between Chalcis and Eretria and he concluded that the passage must be an interpolation into Hesiod's original work, assuming that the Lelantine War was too late for Hesiod. Modern scholars have accepted his identification of Amphidamas but disagreed with his conclusion. The date of the war is not known precisely but estimates placing it around 730–705 BC, fit the estimated chronology for Hesiod. In that case, the tripod that Hesiod won might have been awarded for his rendition of Theogony, <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> <b>that</b> seems to presuppose the kind of aristocratic audience he would have met at Chalcis.|$|E
25|$|Kate now {{has three}} {{suspects}} for Janet's death: Clarkville, Moon, and Luellen May (a fellow professor who found Janet passed {{out in the}} bathtub at a party). After a visit from Janet's brother and a tour of Janet's old apartment, Kate begins to put some ideas together about what really happened to Janet. Kate then visits with Clarkville once more to discuss his finding of Janet's body. In the meeting, Clarkville explains that the last time anyone had seen Janet alive was in the department meeting. During the meeting, Janet had become hysterical about an issue that {{caused a lot of}} tension in the room. Kate then gets Clarkville to admit to moving Janet's body to the men's room for her to be 'discovered'. Clarkville explains that he had originally found Janet in the chairman's office dead and decided to move her to a restroom (the men's room was the closest) and reported finding her there. Kate then is granted access to Janet's office at the university and finds <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> <b>that</b> she believes is the biggest clue to Janet's death.|$|E

500|$|Poe {{claimed to}} have written the poem very logically and methodically, {{intending}} to create <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> <b>that</b> would appeal to both critical and popular tastes, as he explained in his 1846 follow-up essay, [...] "The Philosophy of Composition". The poem was inspired {{in part by a}} talking raven in the novel [...] by Charles Dickens. Poe borrows the complex rhythm and meter of Elizabeth Barrett's poem [...] "Lady Geraldine's Courtship", and makes use of internal rhyme as well as alliteration throughout.|$|E
500|$|While {{working on}} his play Murder in the Cathedral, Eliot {{came up with the}} idea for <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> <b>that</b> was {{structured}} similarly to The Waste Land. The resulting poem, Burnt Norton, named after a manor house, was published in Eliot's 1936 edition of Collected Poems 1909–1935. Eliot decided to create another poem similar to Burnt Norton but with a different location in mind. This second poem, East Coker, was finished and published by Easter 1940. (Eliot visited East Coker in 1937 and his ashes now repose there at St. Michael's Church.) ...|$|E

The legend also says that as a child, Jesus had visited Glastonbury along with Joseph. The legend probably was encouraged during the medieval period when religious relics and pilgrimages were profitable business for abbeys. William Blake mentioned the legend in <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> <b>that</b> became a popular hymn, [...] "Jerusalem" [...] (see And did those feet in ancient time).|$|E
500|$|May was {{described}} variously as a courageous, sometimes reckless, and unpopular officer. Samuel Chamberlain, {{who served in}} the First Dragoons and wrote scathing descriptions of most of his contemporaries, was most critical of May. Chamberlain believed May had received unjustified praise for his actions at Resaca de la Palma and referred to him as the [...] "Murat of America" [...] and an [...] "ass in the lion's skin".

John Keats's 1819 poem Ode to Autumn includes the lines [...] "Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft / The redbreast whistles from a garden-croft".

500|$|Harold Bloom, in 1961, {{described}} [...] "To Autumn" [...] as [...] "the {{most perfect}} shorter poem in the English language." [...] Following this, Walter Jackson Bate, in 1963, claimed that [...] " [...] each generation {{has found it}} one of the most nearly perfect poems in English." [...] Later, in 1973, Stuart Sperry wrote, To Autumn' succeeds through its acceptance of an order innate in our experience [...] the natural rhythm of the seasons. It is <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> <b>that,</b> without ever stating it, inevitably suggests the truth of 'ripeness is all' by developing, with a richness of profundity of implication, the simple perception that ripeness is fall." [...] In 1981, William Walsh argued that [...] "Among the major Odes [...] no one has questioned the place and supremacy of 'To Autumn', in which we see wholly realized, powerfully embodied in art, the complete maturity so earnestly laboured at in Keats's life, so persuasively argued about in his letters." [...] Literary critic and academic Helen Vendler, in 1988, declared that [...] "in the ode 'To Autumn,' Keats finds his most comprehensive and adequate symbol for the social value of art." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review in}} the June 1796 Critical Review argued, [...] "When {{the character of the}} Maid of Orleans, and the part taken by her against the English, are considered, together with {{the manner in which the}} history has been treated by other writers, some suspicion may at first arise, that Mr. Southey has chosen a subject scarcely suited to the dignity of epic poetry. His prudence at least may be called into question. how can he expect to interest the English nation in the fortunes of a heroine who was an active champion against his own countrymen, or be hardly enough to felicitate those successes that involved the English in disgrace?" [...] In regard to the effort put into writing the poem, the review concluded: [...] "The poetical powers of Mr. Southey are indisputable very superior, and capable, we doubt not, of producing <b>a</b> <b>poem</b> <b>that</b> will place him in the first class of English poets. He is at present, he tells his readers, engaged in the execution of Madoc [...] We cannot, therefore, help expressing our wish, that he would not put his future poem to so hazardous an experiment as he has this, by assigning himself so little time for its completion." ...|$|E
