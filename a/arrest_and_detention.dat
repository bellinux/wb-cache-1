5|$|Diefenbaker was {{appointed}} to the House Committee on the Defence of Canada Regulations, an all-party committee which examined the wartime rules which allowed <b>arrest</b> <b>and</b> <b>detention</b> without trial. On June 13, 1940, Diefenbaker made his maiden speech as an MP, supporting the regulations, and emphatically stating that most Canadians of German descent were loyal. When the Mackenzie King government sought to force Canadians of Japanese descent from the Pacific Coast, Diefenbaker fought against the government's actions. However, his efforts were unsuccessful, and the forced relocation and internment of many Japanese-Canadians proceeded.|$|E
5|$|Counsel for Chng, de Souza and Wong {{argued that}} {{although}} section 10 of the ISA conferred {{power on the}} Minister of Home Affairs to revoke a direction suspending a detention order, it did not empower him to subsequently re-arrest and re-detain his clients. Since section 10 should be strictly construed in favour of the detainees' liberty, the court could not imply a power of <b>arrest</b> <b>and</b> <b>detention</b> into section 10 when Parliament had not provided for it. The Court of Appeal took the view that once a suspension direction under section 10 is revoked, the original detention order becomes operative again. The power to arrest and detain is conferred by the detention order itself.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, the Rowlatt Act gave {{extensive}} {{powers to}} the British government and police, and allowed indefinite <b>arrest</b> <b>and</b> <b>detention</b> of individuals, warrant-less searches and seizures, restrictions on public gatherings, and intensive censorship {{of media and}} publications. The public opposition to this act eventually led to mass campaigns of non-violent civil disobedience throughout the country demanding guaranteed civil freedoms, and limitations on government power. Indians, who were seeking independence and their own government, were particularly influenced by the independence of Ireland {{and the development of}} the Irish constitution. Also, the directive principles of state policy in Irish constitution were looked upon by the people of India as an inspiration for the independent India's government to comprehensively tackle complex social and economic challenges across a vast, diverse nation and population.|$|E

50|$|Although an {{increasingly}} {{small percentage of}} total human rights abuses reported were attributed to security forces, some members continued to commit serious abuses, including unlawful and extrajudicial killings. Some members collaborated with the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia paramilitary terrorist group, which has committed serious abuses. Allegations of forced disappearances and kidnappings remained. In 2003 there were allegations of arbitrary <b>arrests</b> <b>and</b> <b>detentions,</b> <b>and</b> prolonged pretrial <b>detention</b> remained a fundamental problem.

25|$|A March 16 MONUC {{report found}} {{widespread}} illegal <b>arrest</b> <b>and</b> <b>detention</b> of minors, particularly street children and children associated with armed groups.

Unlawful killings, disappearances, torture, rape, and arbitrary <b>arrest</b> <b>and</b> <b>detention</b> by security forces increased during the year, and the transitional government took few actions to punish violators. Harsh and life-threatening conditions in prison and detention facilities; prolonged pretrial detention; lack of an independent and effective judiciary; and arbitrary interference with privacy, family, and home also remained serious problems. Security forces continued to recruit and retain child soldiers and to compel forced labour by adults and children.|$|E

50|$|There is a {{widespread}} consensus among human rights organisations that systematic violations {{of the right of}} personal freedom and integrity are frequent in Zimbabwe, especially towards suspected members of the political opposition.

25|$|The {{involvement}} {{of the military in}} politics has historically led to regular, if infrequent, arbitrary <b>arrest</b> <b>and</b> <b>detention,</b> use of excessive force, torture, and extra-judicial killing by security forces and police. The judiciary has historically suffered from poor jail and prison conditions, prolonged pretrial detention, and executive interference in the judiciary. While all these have improved dramatically since the return to civilian rule, international human rights organizations continue to report sporadic incidents of all these abuses. Post-1999 there has been a marked improvement of civilian control of security forces, with the United States State Department contending every year since 2001 that the military was under civilian control.|$|E
25|$|The law prohibits {{arbitrary}} <b>arrest</b> <b>and</b> <b>detention,</b> and {{the government}} generally observes these prohibitions; however, police reportedly arrests and detains citizens arbitrarily on occasion. The federal police have jurisdiction for maintaining {{law and order in}} the federal capital and for federal crimes in the provinces. Other federal police authorities include the Airport Security Police, the Gendarmerie, the Coast Guard, and the Bureau of Prisons. Additionally, each province has its own police force that responds to a provincial security ministry or secretariat. Individual forces vary considerably in their effectiveness and respect for human rights. Corruption is widespread in some forces, and internal controls to counter police abuses are often weak.|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of 1996, several human rights groups brought cases to hold Shell accountable for alleged human rights violations in Nigeria, including summary execution, crimes against humanity, torture, inhumane treatment and arbitrary <b>arrest</b> <b>and</b> <b>detention.</b> In particular, Shell stood accused of collaborating in the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other leaders of the Ogoni tribe of southern Nigeria, who were hanged in 1995 by Nigeria's then military rulers. The lawsuits were brought against Royal Dutch Shell and Brian Anderson, the head of its Nigerian operation. In 2009, Shell agreed to pay $15.5m in a legal settlement. Shell has not accepted any liability over the allegations against it.|$|E
