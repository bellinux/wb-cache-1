5|$|Both {{the player}} and the {{opponent}} have stamina meters, both {{displayed on the}} top of the screen. The meters decrease when either boxer gets hit by a punch. Boxers will get knocked down if their stamina meter runs out. Faster knockdowns will cause that boxer to recover less stamina upon getting up; the same happens if a boxer is knocked down by <b>a</b> <b>knockout</b> punch. Either boxer will lose if they cannot stand up before the count of ten after being knocked down (resulting in <b>a</b> <b>knockout</b> or KO) or if they are knocked down three times in the match (resulting in a technical knockout or TKO). The player can also recover some stamina while the opponent is down by pressing the buttons on the controller.|$|E

40|$|Here {{we report}} the {{development}} of D 1 A 2 <b>A</b> receptor <b>knockout</b> mice to investigate whether interactions between dopamine D 1 and adenosine A 2 A receptors participate in reward-related behavior. The combined deletion of D 1 and A 2 A receptors resulted in mice with decreased weight and appetitive processes, reduced rearing and exploratory behaviors, increased anxiety, and a significantly poorer performance on the rotarod, compared to wild-type littermates. D 1 A 2 <b>A</b> receptor <b>knockout</b> mice shared phenotypic similarities with mice deficient in D 1 receptors, while also paralleling behavioral deficits seen in A 2 <b>A</b> receptor <b>knockout</b> mice, indicating individual components of the behavioral phenotype of the D 1 A 2 <b>A</b> receptor <b>knockout</b> attributable {{to the loss of}} both receptors. In contrast, ethanol and saccharin preference in D 1 A 2 <b>A</b> receptor <b>knockout</b> mice were distinctly different from that observed in derivative D 1 or A 2 A receptor-deficient mice. Compared to wild types, preference and consumption of ethanol were decreased in D 1 A 2 <b>A</b> receptor <b>knockout</b> mice, the reduction in ethanol consumption greater even than that seen in D 1 receptor-deficient mice. Preference and consumption of saccharin were also reduced in D 1 A 2 <b>A</b> receptor <b>knockout</b> mice, whereas saccharin preference was similar in wild-type, D 1, and A 2 <b>A</b> receptor <b>knockout</b> mice. These data suggest an interaction of D 1 and A 2 A receptors in the reinforcement processes underlying the intake of rewarding substances, whereby the A 2 A receptor seems involved in goal-directed behavior and the motor functions underlying the expression of such behaviors, and the D 1 receptor is confirmed as essential in mediating motivational processes related to the repeated intake of novel substances and drugs.

During the first three rounds Wright was in the offensive scoring with jabs. On the fourth round Trinidad connected a solid combination. In the sixth, Wright continued the strategy used in the previous rounds while Trinidad employed a strategy where he tried to neutralize his opponent's punches by standing in front of him.
