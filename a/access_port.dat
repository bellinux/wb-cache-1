The original alignment of what is now NY373 began as a wide road that was built to <b>access</b> <b>Port</b> Kent from the nearby village of Keeseville.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{medications}} {{are also}} given by IV [...] "push" [...] or bolus. A syringe containing the medication {{is connected to}} an <b>access</b> <b>port</b> in the primary tubing and the medication is administered through the port. The syringe plunger is pressed slowly, if it might irritate the vein or cause a too-rapid effect. Certain medications, such as potassium, are never to be administered by IV push because the spike in medication in the blood from the IV push could be fatal. Once a medicine has been injected into the fluid stream of the IV tubing {{there must be some}} means of ensuring that it gets from the tubing to the patient. [...] Usually this is accomplished by allowing the fluid stream to flow normally and thereby carry the medicine into the bloodstream; however, a second fluid injection is sometimes used, a [...] "flush", following the injection to push the medicine into the bloodstream more quickly.|$|E

40|$|Guidelines and {{clinical}} practice recommendations vary on {{the management of}} vascular <b>access</b> <b>ports.</b> Traditionally, patient, health system and healthcare professional's factors have been interrelated in studies of clinical practice variability. Understanding variation {{in the management of}} vascular <b>access</b> <b>ports</b> and to identify the influence of these factors in the compliance with the most common recommendations of vascular access guidelines, is an important first step for designing targeted improvement interventions. We analysed data from a survey sent to all Spanish outpatient clinics. Overall, 185 units at Spanish outpatients clinics {{out of a total of}} 256 completed the survey. Geographical region and unit size are the most common associated factors in the management of vascular <b>access</b> <b>ports</b> and there is a low level of compliance with many of the recommendations given by guidelines. Large outpatient chemotherapy units have been related to higher monitoring of the recommendations. Clinical practice and provided care to patients with vascular <b>access</b> <b>ports</b> are influenced by region and structural and organisational differences in the outpatient chemotherapy units. It is important to identify additional factors that may explain the variability...|$|R

No previous studies exist regarding the effects of electron beams on vascular <b>access</b> <b>ports</b> other than for those made of metal although it has been suggested that electron beam attenuation through non-metal ports may be possible. Measurements of relative ionization through the device and adjacent to the device anteriorly and laterally were taken. A clinical particle accelerator delivered typical clinical electron beams of 6, 9, 12, 16, and 20 MeV through the devices. Results showed a noticeable increase in attenuation in the presence of ports, especially for lower energy beams and little or no variation in scattering measurements...|$|R

40|$|Purpose of the research: To {{describe}} {{the variability in}} practice regarding the management of vascular <b>access</b> <b>ports</b> in adult oncology patients at Spanish outpatient clinics and to evaluate its compliance with the recommended procedural guidelines. Methods and sample: Three e-mailings or three postal mail-outs were sent to all Spanish outpatient clinics, {{in accordance with the}} hospital's preference. An additional fourth postal mail-out was made to all units. In total 185 units at Spanish outpatient clinics out of a total 256 completed the survey questionnaire. Key results: A number of variations exist in the techniques used for insertion, withdrawal of needle from vascular <b>access</b> <b>ports,</b> blood sampling and unblocking procedure. There is considerable agreement in relation to the use of a special beveled needle, the use of gloves in the access and withdrawal procedures and checking of reservoir permeability by aspirating blood. In most cases, sterile gloves are used but there is a lesser occurrence of both scrubbed hands and correct antiseptic use. Conclusions: There are considerable differences in the management of the vascular <b>access</b> <b>ports</b> in terms of the recommendations published in the main international guidelines, though these are based on low level evidence. The results highlight the need for further quality studies in ports use and manipulation to lessen the variability between published recommendations and clinical practice...|$|R
