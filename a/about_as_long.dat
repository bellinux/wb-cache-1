5|$|Pseudoryzomys simplex, {{also known}} as the Brazilian false rice rat or false oryzomys, is a species of rodent in the family Cricetidae from south-central South America. It is found in lowland palm savanna and thorn scrub habitats. It is a {{medium-sized}} species, weighing about , with gray–brown fur, long and narrow hindfeet, and a tail that is <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as the head and body. The IUCN has assessed its conservation status as being of least concern, although almost nothing is known of its diet or reproduction.|$|E
5|$|The sparsely haired tail is <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as {{the head}} and body. It is dark brown above and lighter below. In contrast, the tail of H.megacephalus has little to no {{difference}} in color between {{the upper and lower}} surface. In 2006, Weksler and colleagues noted tail coloration as a difference between the two species of Transandinomys (bicolored in T.talamancae and unicolored in T.bolivaris), but in their 1998 study, Musser and colleagues could not find differences in tail coloration between their Panamanian samples of the two species.|$|E
5|$|The tail appears {{naked and}} is shorter than or <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> {{as the head}} and body; it is longer in T.talamancae. Its {{coloration}} is variable; it is dark brown above and at the sides and light brown and often white {{to a greater or}} smaller extent below, and in some specimens the tail has the same color above and below. The scales on the tail are smaller than in T.talamancae.|$|E

5|$|The Freshman Issue {{is another}} {{special edition of}} the Technique. It is the first issue {{published}} each academic year and {{is by far the}} longest issue, with each of the sections <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as a normal issue. The content usually centers on the themes of welcoming Freshmen and welcoming returning students back to Tech. The Freshman Issue also contains a special section dedicated to helping Freshmen become more acquainted with Tech and its customs. It is generally the only issue in which content from previous issues is reprinted.|$|E
5|$|The adult has {{two pairs}} of long, narrow, multiveined, {{translucent}} wings and a long, slender abdomen. Although they somewhat resemble dragonflies or damselflies, they belong to a different infraclass of winged insects. Antlion adults are easily distinguished from damselflies by their prominent, apically clubbed antennae which are <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as the head and thorax combined. Also, the pattern of wing venation differs, and compared to damselflies, the adults are very feeble fliers and are normally found fluttering about at night {{in search of a}} mate. Adult antlions are typically nocturnal, and rarely seen by day.|$|E
5|$|The long, falcate (sickle-shaped) {{pectoral}} fins taper to narrowly pointed tips. The first {{dorsal fin}} {{is tall and}} positioned slightly closer to the pectoral fins than the pelvic fins. The pelvic fins are almost {{as large as the}} first dorsal fin and bear long, thin claspers in males. The second dorsal and anal fins are tiny, with the former positioned ahead of the latter. There are crescent-shaped notches on the caudal peduncle at the upper and lower origins of the caudal fin. The upper caudal fin lobe is enormously elongated as is characteristic of threshers, measuring <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> {{as the rest of the}} shark; the thin, gently curving lobe is held at a steep upward angle and has a notch in the trailing margin near the tip.|$|E

5|$|Mantises {{have two}} spiked, {{grasping}} forelegs ("raptorial legs") in which prey items are caught and held securely. In most insect legs, including the posterior four {{legs of a}} mantis, the coxa and trochanter combine as an inconspicuous base of the leg; in the raptorial legs, however, the coxa and trochanter combine to form a segment <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as the femur, which is a spiky part of the grasping apparatus (see illustration). Located {{at the base of}} the femur is a set of discoidal spines, usually four in number, but ranging from none to as many as five depending on the species. These spines are preceded by a number of tooth-like tubercles, which, along with a similar series of tubercles along the tibia and the apical claw near its tip, give the foreleg of the mantis its grasp on its prey. The foreleg ends in a delicate tarsus used as a walking appendage, made of four or five segments and ending in a two-toed claw with no arolium.|$|E
5|$|The first lower molar is rounded at {{the front}} end and the labial and lingual conules of the anteroconid, the frontmost cusp, are barely distinct. The second lower molar is {{elongated}} and has a crest, the anterolophid, before the two cusps that form {{the front edge of}} the molar in some other oryzomyines, the protoconid and metaconid. A distinct ridge (anterolabial cingulum) is at the outer front (anterolabial) edge of the molar, before the protoconid. The lower third molar is <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as the second and also has an anterolophid, albeit a less well-defined one. The first lower molar has large roots {{at the front}} and back of the tooth and usually one or two smaller ones in between, at the labial and lingual side. The second and third lowers molars have either two roots, one labial and one lingual, or only one at the front, and another large root at the back.|$|E
5|$|The fur is {{brownish}} (T.bolivaris) or reddish (T.talamancae) {{above and}} lighter below, appearing whitish, but {{the hairs on}} the underparts have gray bases. The snout is large. The mystacial (above the mouth) and superciliary vibrissae both extend to at least the back margin of the ears when laid back against the head, but are much longer in T.bolivaris. The pinna (external ear) is large. On the hindfeet, which are long and narrow, ungual tufts of hairs surround the bases of the toes. In T.bolivaris, the sole usually entirely lacks squamae (small, scale-like structures), but T.talamancae does have squamae on part of its sole. The claw of the first toe extends about {{to the middle of}} the first phalange of the second and that of the fifth toe extends nearly to the base of the second phalange of the fourth. The tail is at least <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as the head and body, sometimes slightly longer. The tail is darker above than below in T.talamancae, but there may not be a difference in color in T.bolivaris. The tail appears naked, but is covered with fine hairs.|$|E

50|$|The dorsal {{exoskeleton}} of Kangacaris is inverted egg-shaped, about 3 cm {{long and}} 2 cm wide. The axis is ⅓× {{as wide as}} the body and only slightly raised. The semi-circular headshield (or cephalon) is <b>about</b> ⅔× <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> the tailshield (pygidium), and in between them three short thoracic body segments (somites). The lateral margin of the pygidium is progressively angling towards the axis, ending in the slightest hint of a point. Twelve to thirteen furrows are most distinct on the axis, and becoming indiscernible near the border. The border of the cephalon is <b>about</b> ¼× <b>as</b> <b>long</b> (axially) <b>as</b> the thoracal somites, and the border of the pygidium is <b>about</b> ½× <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> the somites. This border has about 17 regularly spaced ridges perpendicular to the rim. K. shui has a better defined and narrower axis, more arched posterior margin of the cephalic shield, more posterolaterally deflected pleural areas of the thoracic segments, and smaller pygidium than K. zhangi.|$|R

5|$|At 6.8 to 9.2 (7.7) mm, {{males are}} only about half as long as females. Their maximum width is 34 to 42 (37) μm. The length of the {{esophagus}} is 2.3 to 3.0 (2.6) mm, of which the muscular pharynx makes up 260 to 315 (273) μm, and is lined by 35 to 42 (37) stichocytes. The back region of the worm is 4.5 to 6.2 (5.1) mm long. The back, or rectal, opening of the digestive tube is located {{near the end of}} the worm, and the length of the cloaca is 530 to 576 (550) μm. Near the back end, there are two alae (ridges) at the sides (laterally), which are 40 to 55 (46) μm long; these are located at 10 to 15 μm from another, small ala at the tip. In A.putorii, the lateral alae are much longer and reach the ala at the tip. The spicule, a spikelike structure that functions in reproduction, is curved at the tip and hardened and has a length of 380 to 426 (406) μm. It is smaller than that of the similar A.tamiasstriati from North American chipmunks and larger than that of A.murissylvatici from various North American and European small rodents, but <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as that of A.putorii, which however lacks the curved tip.|$|E
