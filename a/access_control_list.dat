They are shown when listing files in long format, or, if <b>Access</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Lists</b> are in use, using getfacl.

5000|$|On systems {{configured}} {{with security}} level 1 or higher levels, the user who creates an object is the object's owner. The default {{is that the}} object is private to the creating user, {{but it may also}} be public or controlled by an <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>list.</b> The owner or the security officer may create an <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>list</b> for that object.|$|E

50|$|When a {{credential}} {{is presented}} to a reader, the reader sends the credentialâ€™s information, usually a number, to a control panel, a highly reliable processor. The control panel compares the credential's number to an <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>list,</b> grants or denies the presented request, and sends a transaction log to a database. When access is denied based on the <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>list,</b> the door remains locked. If there is a match between the credential and the <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>list,</b> the control panel operates a relay that in turn unlocks the door. The control panel also ignores a door open signal to prevent an alarm. Often the reader provides feedback, such as a flashing red LED for an access denied and a flashing green LED for an access granted.|$|E

50|$|On {{some types}} of {{proprietary}} computer-hardware (in particular routers and switches), an <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>list</b> provides rules that are applied to port numbers or IP addresses that are available on a host or other layer 3, each {{with a list of}} hosts and/or networks permitted to use the service. Although it is additionally possible to configure access control lists based on network domain names, this is a questionable idea because individual TCP, UDP, and ICMP headers do not contain domain names. Consequently, the device enforcing the <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>list</b> must separately resolve names to numeric addresses. This presents an additional attack surface for an attacker who is seeking to compromise security of the system which the <b>access</b> <b>control</b> <b>list</b> is protecting. Both individual servers as well as routers can have network ACLs. Access control lists can generally be configured to control both inbound and outbound traffic, and in this context they are similar to firewalls. Like firewalls, ACLs could be subject to security regulations and standards such as PCI DSS.|$|E
