40|$|There is {{a growing}} need for {{research}} into new skin- and environment-friendly surfactants. This paper focuses on a natural surfactant of an <b>alkylpolyglucoside</b> type, which can form both thermotropic and lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases. The {{aim of this study}} was to relate some physicochemical properties (characterised by polarisation and transmission electron microscopy, thermal analysis and rheology) of the three formulations based on cetearyl glucoside and cetearyl alcohol, to the results of in vitro and in vivo bioavailability of hydrocortisone (HC). The three formulations contained oils of different polarity (medium chain triglycerides: MG, isopropyl myristate: IPM and light liquid paraffin: LP), respectively. In vitro permeation was followed through the artificial skin constructs (ASC), while the parameters measured in vivo were erythema index: EI (using instrumental human skin blanching assay), transepidermal water loss (TEWL) and stratum corneum hydration (SCH). The vehicles based on cetearyl glucoside and cetearyl alcohol showed a complex colloidal structure of lamellar liquid-crystalline and lamellar gel-crystalline type, depending on oil polarity. Rheological profile of the vehicle was directly related to the in vitro profile of the HC permeation. In vivo results suggested that the vehicle with MG retarded the HC permeation, whereas less polar IPM and non-polar LP enhanced it. It is suggested that the enhancement is achieved either by a direct interaction with lipid lamellae of the SC or indirectly by improving skin hydration. There were no adverse effects during in vivo study, which indicates a good safety profile of this <b>alkylpolyglucoside</b> surfactant...|$|E

Polarization and ordinary light as well as transmission electron microscopy, wide angle X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis and rheological measurement, as well as in vivo hydration potential Were employed for testing the systems Characterization. A comparison of results Obtained from Isothermal thermogravimetry and in vivo short-term application study served to Recognize Within water distribution systems and the dynamic of water evaporation, ie to consider in the Possibility of Formulation and Prolonged water emulsion with controlled release. It Was Suggested That Cetearyl glucoside & Cetearyl alcohol stabilizes the o / w creams by synergistic effects of Viscoelastic Hydrophilic Lamellar type of gel and lipophilic gel network built up from semi-Cetostearyl alcohol hydrates as well as by Lamellar liquid crystalline bilayers surrounding the oil droplets. Generally, in creams based on the non-ionic Emulsifier <b>alkylpolyglucoside</b> MontanovÒ 68 PHA four fractions of water Could Be Met: 1) free - bulk water, 2) Within lipophilic gel bonded water (secondary water), 3) water interlamelarilly Between fixed crystalline lipid bilayers (Hydrophilic gel) and 4) water Between fixed lipid layers in liquid-crystalline state. It is Also Showed That Additions oil into The Chosen binary system microstructure Significantly Influences the creams, Which Reflects Particularly onto the mode of water distribution and consequently Their creams Within The potential of skin hydration.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{formulate}} and optimize the washing performance of an alkylpolyglucoside-based dishwashing detergent. The liquid detergent was formulated with five ingredients of commercial origin: anionic (linear sodium alkylbenzenesulfonate and sodium laurylethersulfate), nonionic (C 12 –C 14 <b>alkylpolyglucoside)</b> and zwitterionic (a fatty acid amide derivative with a betaine structure) surfactants, and NaCl for viscosity control. In addition to the plate test, other properties were investigated including ‘‘cloud point’’, viscosity, and emulsion stability. Statistical analysis software was used to generate a central composite experimental design. Then, a second order design and analysis of experiments approach, known as the Response Surface Methodology, {{was set up to}} investigate the effects of the five components of the formulation on the studied properties in the region covering plausible component ranges.

40|$|Abstract. The {{synthesis}} of <b>alkylpolyglucosides</b> involves condensation of decanol with dextrose {{in the presence}} of mesoporous silica sol-gel as a catalyst. In this study, mesoporous silica was produced using sol-gel technique by converting tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) into silica. The mesoporous silica was characterized using BET surface area measurement and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy surface analysis. The specific BET surface area was 794 m 2 /g. From the XPS analysis, the Si 2 p binding energy is 103. 7 eV while the O 1 s binding energy is 532. 8 eV indicating the formation of Si-O-Si bond which attributed to SiO 2. Mesoporous silica has been found efficient to be solid catalyst for synthesis <b>alkylpolyglucosides</b> and easy to be separated. The reaction was carried out 8 hours at 110 o C- 120 o C under vacuum condition. The mass determination of alkylpoluglucosides has been achieved by ESI LC-MS/MS (ToF) positive-mode giving a mass peak at m/z = 343. 21 corresponding to [M+H] of alkylmonoglucoside peak at retention time 11. 0 min...|$|R

In this work, we assessed the antimicrobial properties at room temperature of surfactants of industrial interest in detergent formulation. The adhesion abilities of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica and the mould Aspergillus niger to polyurethane foam and glass surfaces {{and their ability to}} develop as biofilm was firstly studied under different culture conditions. The most stable biofilms were then treated at room temperature with a mixture of an <b>alkylpolyglucoside</b> and an ethoxylated fatty alcohol, and with an ether carboxylate. Experimental results illustrated that surface-attached cells were more resistant to disinfectant treatment than cells of the same microorganism grown in suspension. Although the assayed surfactant solutionshardly removed attached biofilms, they showed a greatinhibitory effect on free-living cells. What is more, biofilmsdid not grow during treatments. Therefore, the good antimicrobial effects of these ecological surfactants at roomtemperature could provide them a potential interest inlow-temperature cleaning in place procedures...|$|E

The aim of part I {{of this study was}} to compare efficacy and irritation potential of LA vs. glycolic acid (GA) from two types of vehicles – gel and emulsion. In part II, effects of LA-containing emulsions based on a new, natural emulsifier of <b>alkylpolyglucoside</b> (APG) type were evaluated. Methods  Skin bioengineering was used on 77 healthy volunteers to assess: color as erythema and melanin (MI) index, transepidermal water loss, electrical capacitance and pH of the skin.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to characterise the physical-chemical {{properties}} of alkylglucosides. Alkylglucosides are non-ionic surfactants synthesized from glucose and a fatty alcohol. The glucose molecule constitutes the hydrophilic head group and the fatty alcohol constitutes the hydrophobic tail. The two parts are linked together with a glucoside bond. In nature, the building and breakage of a glucoside bond are controlled by different enzymes called glucosidases. This makes alkylglucosides highly biodegradable. Alkylglucosides also have low toxicity towards biological life. Therefore, alkylglucosides are very interesting in applications like laundry, car wash, shampoo, personal care products and cosmetics. There are two possible ways of attaching a glucose molecule to the fatty alcohol, viz. a- or b-bond. The two ways give different physical-chemical properties to the alkylglucoside. One such property is different packing in a crystal lattice. In this study, the physical-chemical properties of some short-chain alkylglucosides have been determined, viz. C 8 -, C 9 -, and C 10 -alkylglucosides. Alkylglucosides with a- and b-bonding, as well as straight and branched tails have been studied. The study includes both alkylmonoglucosides, which are anomerically pure, and commercially available <b>alkylpolyglucosides.</b> The study is based on the determination of binary surfactant/water phase diagrams (temperature vs. concentration) and ternary surfactant/ surfactant/water phase diagrams. The different phases in the phase diagram have been investigated to obtain information concerning aggregates size/structure and aggregate-aggregate interactions. Techniques like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) self-diffusion, microscope, small-angel X-ray scattering (SAXS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and fluorescence have been used to determine the physical-chemical properties. A general feature of alkylglucosides is a broad solution phase extending from neat water to approximately 60 - 70 wt% surfactant. At higher surfactant concentrations, liquid crystalline phases are formed. Alkylglucosides with straight tails can form hexagonal, cubic and lamellar liquid crystalline phases, whereas alkylglucosides with branched tails only form lamellar liquid crystalline phases. A conclusion from the study is that alkylglucosides do not form spherical micelles but elongated aggregates. The aggregates size increase significantly when the number of carbon atoms in the tail increase. When there are ten or more carbon atoms in the tail a phase separation occurs at dilute concentration. A mechanism behind the phase separation has been proposed based on the dilution of a surfactant network. Repetition distances and head group areas in the liquid crystalline phases have been calculated. A general observation is the surfactant head group area are fairly unchanged when the concentration increases. An explanation for this behaviour is the glucose molecule requires a certain amount of hydration water. When this condition is met there is no gain in free energy by changing the head group area at the hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface...|$|R
40|$|In {{the work}} {{presented}} here, two independent methods were {{developed for the}} analysis of <b>alkylpolyglucosides</b> (APGs) in technical mixtures and in commercial products. The methods are based on micellar electrokinetic chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (MECC-PAD) and two-dimensional gas chromatography with mass-spectrometric detection (GCxGC-MS). While, of the two detection principles applied, MECC-PAD exhibits high selectivity {{for the analysis of}} the APGs, GCxGC-(TOF) MS, because of its high separative power, makes possible the collection and quantification not only of the APGs, but also, after appropriate sample preparation, of other classes of tensides. For carrying out the MECC-PAD analysis, a detection cell was designed, with which disturbances of the detection signal could be eliminated. This made possible routine measurements with high reproducibility. An important step in the separation and optimization of the method was the use of two different electrolytes for the separation and detection. During the APG investigations two separation buffers were used: Dehydol LS 50 (2500 mg/mL); SDS (12 mM) in Na 2 HPO 4 (10 mM; pH 9. 5) Na-tetradecylsulfonate (3 mM); Brij 58 (5000 mg/mL); in Na 2 HPO 4 (10 mM; pH 9. 5); ACN 25 %(v/v) Separation buffer (1) was suitable for the determination of short-chained APGs in technical products without sample preparation. The analysis of APG ® - 220 (Cognis Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG) resulted in 16. 18 ± 0. 31 % n-octyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (αC 8) and 8. 22 ± 0. 26 % n-octyl-ß-D-glucopyranoside (ßC 8) and confirmed thereby quite well the manufacturer` data (23. 26 % αßC 8). The detection limit of the method were to 0. 070 g/L (αC 8) and 0. 075 g/L (ßC 8). With neither separation buffers was it not possible to achieve complete separation of all homologues and anomers. Thus the separation of anomers with the separation buffer (1) succeeded up to αßC 10, but all higher homologues were detected unseparated as a single signal. Although separation buffer (2) permitted homologue separation up to αßC 12, no separation of anomers could be observed. This separation buffer was preferred because with it the homologue distribution in technical and commercial products could be determined. With GCxGC-(TOF) MS the separation limits of the MECC-PAD could be overcome. In the case of the APGs, the sample preparation amounted to nothing more than silylation. Thus not only the homologues (discrimination according to alkyl chain length and number of glucose units) and anomers (α,ß), but even the pyranosides and furanosides could be separated completely from each other. In addition, the high peak capacity and the better detection limit of GCxGC-(TOF) MS made possible the determination of other tenside classes like fatty alcohol ethoxylates (FAEO) and cocamidopropylacetobetaines (CAPB) in a single run. In order to determine the fatty alcohol sulfates (FAS) and fatty alcohol ether sulfates (FAES) at the same time, the samples had to be hydrolyzed before the silylation. In an excellent confirmation of the manufacturer's data, the analysis of a model shampoo (Cognis Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG) resulted in 1. 96 ± 0. 02 % (APG), 2. 5 ± 0. 4 % (FAEO), 4. 5 ± 0. 03 % (CAPB) and 6. 5 ± 1. 2 % (FAES) ...|$|R

A foam of Mg 0. 9 Co 0. 1 Al 2 O 4 solid solution is prepared by the gelcasting-foam method using notably mono- and di-functional acrylate monomers. Using a surfactant in the <b>alkylpolyglucoside</b> family allows to prevent structure changes in the foam {{before the onset of}} polymerisation. The wet ceramic foam is dried in air, producing a foam with an open porosity. Total porosity is equal to about 98 % and the diameter of the pores is in the range 25 – 300 mm, about 90 % being smaller than 200 mm. The Mg 0. 9 Co 0. 1 Al 2 O 4 foam is reduced in H 2 –CH 4 atmosphere, giving rise to a CNTs–Co MgAl 2 O 4 composite foam.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{formulate}} minoxidil loaded liposome and niosome formulations to improve skin drug delivery. Multilamellar liposomes were prepared using soy phosphatidylcholine at different purity degrees (Phospholiponw 90, 90 % purity, soy lecithin (SL), 75 % purity) and cholesterol (Chol), whereas niosomes were made with two different commercial mixtures of <b>alkylpolyglucoside</b> (APG) surfactants (Oramixw NS 10, Oramixw CG 110), Chol and dicetylphosphate. Minoxidil skin penetration and permeation experiments were performed in vitro using vertical diffusion Franz cells and human skin treated with either drug vesicular systems or propylene glycol–water–ethanol solution (control). Penetration of minoxidil in epidermal and dermal layers was greater with liposomes than with niosomal formulations and the control solution. These differences might {{be attributed to the}} smaller size and the greater potential targeting to skin and skin appendages of liposomal carriers, which enhanced globally the skin drug delivery. The greatest skin accumulation was always obtained with nondialysed vesicular formulations. No permeation of minoxidil through the whole skin thickness was detected in the present study irrespective of the existence of hair follicles. Alcohol-free liposomal formulations would constitute a promising pproach for the topical delivery of minoxidil in hair loss treatment...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} need for {{research}} into new skin- and environment-friendly surfactants. The aim {{of the study was}} to find out whether a combination of an <b>alkylpolyglucoside</b> natural surfactant with established pharmaceutical excipients could provide a solid pharmaceutical base with satisfied physical stability. The study was carried out in two phases: the first one focused on the colloidal structure of vehicles formulated with oils of different polarity and/or different costabilizer (lipophilic versus hydrophilic) and the second one evaluated vehicles' physical stability. A number of techniques were used (polarization, light, and transmission electron microscopy, pH, conductivity and thermogravimetric measurements, rheological analysis and cyclic temperature stress test). Natural surfactant's interaction with used excipients resulted in the formation of semisolid emulsion systems of different rheological profiles, stabilized predominantly by synergistic effects of lamellar liquid-crystalline (L) and complex lamellar gel (Lβ) phases. The type of used oil and costabilizer significantly influenced the colloidal structure of the vehicles, particularly in terms of water distribution mode and initial rheological performance as well as their physical stability. It was recommended that medium polar oils of ester type and lipophilic costabilizers, particularly long chain fatty alcohols, should be used in the formulation of stable alkylpolyglucoside-based topical vehicles...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{ascertain}} the capability of a commercial mixture of decylpolyglucoside (Oramix NS 10) to form vesicle structures in water, either alone or in association with cholesterol. To this purpose we compared results obtained from a theoretical model with those acquired from the experimental characterization of different Oramix NS 10 /cholesterol mixtures. The germen vesicular formation theory was used to predict the formation process of vesicular structures. To this purpose, the energy balance involved in the vesicle formation was calculated using critical concentration for vesicle formation (ccf), surface tension and molecular area of decylpolyglucoside. The ccf was measured by turbidity measurements, and surface tension was determined by a tensiometer study. In order to confirm {{the validity of the}} theoretical model, we prepared and characterized vesicles made with decylpolyglucoside and cholesterol in several molar ratios and using different preparation methods. Vesicles were characterized using optical and light polarized microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. The capability of vesicles to encapsulate a hydrophilic probe was also studied. Results obtained showed that the decylpolyglucoside surfactant is able to form vesicles only; in the presence of an appropriate cholesterol content (i. e. Oramix NS 10 /cholesterol molar ratio >= 1 / 0. 4) and that the mathematical model proposed is a useful and reproducible toot capable of predicting the type of aggregation structures given by the <b>alkylpolyglucoside</b> in water...|$|E
40|$|A {{search for}} clay-surfactant based {{formulations}} with {{high percentage of}} the active ingredient, which can yield slow release of active molecules is described. The active ingredients were the herbicides metribuzin (MZ), mesotrione (MS) and flurtamone (FL), whose solubilities were examined {{in the presence of}} four commercial surfactants; (i) neutral: two berols (B 048, B 266) and an <b>alkylpolyglucoside</b> (AG 6202); (ii) cationic: an ethoxylated amine (ET/ 15). Significant percent of active ingredient (a. i.) in the clay/surfactant/herbicide formulations could be achieved only when most of the surfactant was added as micelles. MZ and FL were well solubilized by berols, whereas MS by ET/ 15. Sorption of surfactants on the clay mineral sepiolite occurred mostly by sorption of micelles, and the loadings exceeded the CEC. Higher loadings were determined for B 266 and ET/ 15. The sorption of surfactants was modeled by using the Langmuir-Scatchard equation which permitted the determination of binding coefficients {{that could be used for}} further predictions of the sorbed amounts of surfactants under a wide range of clay/surfactant ratios. A possibility was tested of designing clay-surfactant based formulations of certain herbicides by assuming the same ratio between herbicides and surfactants in the formulations as for herbicides incorporated in micelles in solution. Calculations indicated that satisfactory FL formulations could not be synthesized. The experimental fractions of herbicides in the formulations were in agreement with the predicted ones for MS and MZ. The validity of this approach was confirmed in in vitro release tests that showed a slowing down of the release o...|$|E
