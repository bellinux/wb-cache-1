50|$|Camp Mirage was {{originally}} {{used by the}} Long Range Patrol Detachment Southwest-Asia using CP-140 Aurora maritime-patrol aircraft, starting in December 2001, a time later CC-130 Hercs arrived. Strategic airlift aircraft {{in the form of}} C-17 Globemaster III and CC-150 Polaris operated from CFB Trenton and other air bases in Canada to Camp Mirage to drop off and pick up cargo. This cargo was then transferred onto tactical airlift aircraft in the form of C-130 Hercules and C-17 Globemaster III aircraft for the final flight to Kandahar International Airport in Afghanistan. This final flight was believed to take a route approximately 400 nmi km east southeast over the Gulf of Oman until passing east of the Iran-Pakistan border before turning north over Pakistan airspace for the remaining 500 nmi km to Kandahar. The base also included <b>aircraft</b> <b>maintenance</b> facilities, sleeping <b>areas,</b> a cafeteria and a ball-hockey rink.
