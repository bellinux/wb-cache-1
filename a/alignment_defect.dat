Here, we demonstrate that UBXN- 2, a substrate adaptor of the AAA ATPase Cdc 48 /p 97, is required to coordinate centrosome maturation timing with mitosis. In UBXN- 2 -depleted Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, centrosomes recruited more AIR- 1 (Aurora A), matured precociously, and alignment of the mitotic spindle with the axis of polarity was impaired. UBXN- 2 and CDC- 48 coimmunoprecipitated with AIR- 1 and the spindle <b>alignment</b> <b>defect</b> was partially rescued by co-depleting AIR- 1, indicating that UBXN- 2 controls these processes via AIR- 1. Similarly, depletion in human cells of the UBXN- 2 orthologues p 37 /p 47 resulted in an accumulation of Aurora A at centrosomes and a delay in centrosome separation. The latter defect was also rescued by inhibiting Aurora A. We therefore postulate that the role of this adaptor in cell cycle regulation is conserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{elevated}} {{incidence of}} aneuploidy in human oocytes warrants {{study of the}} molecular mechanisms regulating proper chromosome segregation. The Aurora kinases are a well-conserved family of serine/threonine kinases {{that are involved in}} proper chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis. Here we report the expression and localization of all three Aurora kinase homologs, AURKA, AURKB, and AURKC, during meiotic maturation of mouse oocytes. AURKA, the most abundantly expressed homolog, localizes to the spindle poles during meiosis I (MI) and meiosis II (MII), whereas AURKB is concentrated at kinetochores, specifically at metaphase of MI (Met I). The germ cell-specific homolog, AURKC, is found along the entire length of chromosomes during both meiotic divisions. Maturing oocytes {{in the presence of the}} small molecule pan-Aurora kinase inhibitor, ZM 447439 results in defects in meiotic progression and chromosome alignment at both Met I and Met II.

These risk based buckling evaluations are particularly useful for dealing with statistical variability in the track parameters. The risk approach can provide economic options for track maintenance to achieve the desirable buckling strength.

40|$|Abstract Background Several {{mechanisms}} operate during mitosis {{to ensure}} accurate chromosome segregation. However, during tumour evolution these mechanisms go awry resulting in chromosome instability. While several lines of evidence suggest that mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) may promote chromosome instability, {{at least in}} colon cancer, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we turn our attention to GSK- 3 – a protein kinase, which in concert with APC, targets β-catenin for proteolysis – and ask whether GSK- 3 is required for accurate chromosome segregation. Results To probe the role of GSK- 3 in mitosis, we inhibited GSK- 3 kinase activity in cells using a panel of small molecule inhibitors, including SB- 415286, AR-A 014418, 1 -Azakenpaullone and CHIR 99021. Analysis of synchronised HeLa cells shows that GSK- 3 inhibitors do not prevent G 1 /S progression or cell division. They do, however, significantly delay mitotic exit, largely because inhibitor-treated cells have difficulty aligning all their chromosomes. Although bipolar spindles form {{and the majority of}} chromosomes biorient, one or more chromosomes often remain mono-oriented near the spindle poles. Despite a prolonged mitotic delay, anaphase frequently initiates without the last chromosome aligning, resulting in chromosome non-disjunction. To rule out the possibility of "off-target" effects, we also used RNA interference to selectively repress GSK- 3 β. Cells deficient for GSK- 3 β exhibit a similar chromosome <b>alignment</b> <b>defect,</b> with chromosomes clustered near the spindle poles. GSK- 3 β repression also results in cells accumulating micronuclei, a hallmark of chromosome missegregation. Conclusion Thus, not only do our observations indicate a role for GSK- 3 in accurate chromosome segregation, but they also raise the possibility that, if used as therapeutic agents, GSK- 3 inhibitors may induce unwanted side effects by inducing chromosome instability. </p...|$|E

The line {{patterns}} {{obtained by}} the self-assembly of the block copolymer (BCP) polystyrene-b-polyethylene oxide (PS-b-PEO) was investigated. The hexagonal PS-b-PEO 42 k- 11. 5 k in a thin film was solvent annealed in a chlorophorm saturated atmosphere for three different annealing times. The microphase segregation of this BCP returned 18 nm cylinders of PEO through the PS matrix, with an approximately 40 n periodicity, as expected. Under chlorophorm vapours, the PEO cylinders oriented perpendicular to the silicon substrate while increasing the annealing time. These cylinders formed linear patterns with different alignment. To achieve insights about the percentage of <b>alignment,</b> <b>defect</b> type pareto and density, and order quantification to compare the three annealing recipes, the samples were analysed with innovative image analysis software specifically developed in our laboratory to identify elements and defects of line arrays from block copolymer self-assembly. From this technique, it was extracted dimensional metrology estimating pitch size and placement error, and the line-width of the lines was estimated. Secondly, the methodology allows identification and quantification of typical defects observable in BCP systems, such as turning points, disclination or branching points, break or lone points and end points. The defect density and the quantification of the alignment were estimated using our technique. The methodology presented here represents a step forward in dimensional metrology and defect analysis of BCP DSA systems and can be readily used to analyze other lithographic or non-lithographic patterns.

40|$|Aneuploidy is a {{clinically}} important {{condition that}} can affect the health and fertility of an individual {{as well as his}} or her offspring. Many cases of aneuploidy arise as a result of mistakes during meiosis in females. This thesis used the mouse as a model to study the roles of the aurora kinases, Rad 51 c, and CREB Binding Protein (CBP) during female meiosis. Quantitative RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, and microinjection of fluorescently-tagged aurora kinases, allowed us to determine the expression and localization of all three aurora kinases in mouse oocytes. AURKA localizes to microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) and meiotic spindles at metaphase I (Met I) and metaphase II (Met II), suggesting it {{may play a role in}} organizing both meiotic spindles. Both AURKA and AURKB are found at the midbody during telophase I (TI) and formation of the first polar body, indicating that they may participate in the asymmetric cytokinesis that occurs. AURKB is concentrated on the kinetochores at Met I, but absent from the chromosomes at Met II, while AURKC, the meiotic homolog, is found on the chromosomes during Met I and Met II. Treatment of oocytes with the pan-aurora kinase inhibitor ZM 447439 caused defects in meiotic progression and chromosome alignment at Met I and Met II. Microinjection of a fluorescently-tagged AURKB rescued the chromosome <b>alignment</b> <b>defect</b> seen at Met I. These studies suggest that although AURKB is the primary aurora kinase responsible for chromosome alignment at Met I, AURKC is responsible for chromosome alignment at Met II. Through the creation of Rad 51 c hypomorphic mice, we show that RAD 51 C appears to play an early role in prophase I (PI) that affects ovulation and alignment of chromosomes at Met I, as well as a later role in Holliday Junction (HJ) resolution. Both functions may contribute to aneuploidy. Finally, the creation of mice lacking CBP specifically in the oocyte, reveals a role for CBP in female fertility. CBP acetylates histone H 2 B in the transcriptionally active Germinal Vesicle (GV) intact oocyte and its activity may be required either directly or indirectly for spindle formation at Met II. Taken together, these studies reveal specific roles for the aurora kinases, Rad 51 c, and CBP during female meiosis. Perturbation of any of these molecules can cause mistakes in meiosis leading to aneuploidy. ...|$|E

40|$|During mitosis, {{accurate}} {{chromosome segregation}} is essential: gain {{or loss of}} genetic information can be detrimental to cell viability, or promote tumourigenesis. The mitotic checkpoint (also known as the spindle assembly checkpoint or SAC) ensures accurate chromosome segregation by delaying cell cycle progression until accuracy can be guaranteed. Mps 1 is a protein kinase that is crucial for mitotic checkpoint signalling and also for proper chromosome alignment at metaphase. However, the precise role of Mps 1 ’s catalytic activity is still unclear. Here, I present AZ 3146, a novel small molecule inhibitor of Mps 1. AZ 3146 inhibits recombinant Mps 1 in vitro with an IC 50 of ~ 35 nM, and has low activity against a panel of 50 kinases, suggesting a reasonable degree of selectivity. As predicted for an Mps 1 inhibitor, AZ 1346 treatment led to spindle checkpoint malfunction in cells, accelerated mitotic timing, and perturbed the kinetochore localisation of the checkpoint effector Mad 2. AZ 3146 has {{a negative effect on}} cell viability, suggesting it leads to detrimental missegregations. Thus, the cellular effects of AZ 3146 are consistent with Mps 1 inhibition, and I was able to use the compound confidently as a tool to further probe the role of Mps 1 activity in cells. Strikingly, levels of Mps 1 increased at unattached kinetochores following inhibition of its kinase activity, suggesting Mps 1 ’s kinetochore localisation is regulated by its own activity. A kinase-dead GFP-Mps 1 fusion protein only accumulated at kinetochores in the absence of endogenous, active Mps 1, implicating intra-molecular interactions in regulation of Mps 1 ’s kinetochore localisation. I confirm a role for Mps 1 in the mechanism of chromosome alignment, but in contrast to previous reports I did not detect a decrease in Aurora B activity following Mps 1 inhibition. On the contrary, both Mps 1 ’s phosphorylation status and its kinetochore localisation were affected by treatment with the Aurora B inhibitor ZM 447439, placing Mps 1 downstream of Aurora B. As an alternative explanation for the <b>alignment</b> <b>defect</b> in cells with reduced Mps 1 activity, I found that levels of the plus-end directed kinesin Cenp-E were markedly decreased at unaligned kinetochores. I propose a model in which catalytically active Mps 1 ’s auto-release from kinetochores simultaneously promotes both mitotic checkpoint signalling and chromosome alignment by facilitating Mad 2 dimerisation and Cenp-E binding at unattached kinetochores.

40|$|During {{the cell}} cycle, {{duplicated}} DNA in S phase is segregated, {{in the form}} of chromatids, into two daughter cells in mitosis. The accuracy of chromosome segregation is essential as two daughter cells have the same genetic contents as the mother cell. Two major mechanisms are utilized by the cell to ensure accurate chromosome segregation. First, interactions between the dynamic microtubules and kinetochores, the proteinaceous structures built on centromeres of mitotic chromosomes that act as the attachment site for microtubules, serve as major forces to position each pair of chromosomes to the metaphase plate. Secondly, a surveillance system, known as the mitotic checkpoint, put the anaphase onset on hold until each pair of sister chromosomes are aligned at the metaphase plate and appropriately attached with microtubule plus ends by kinetochores. In the first part (Chapter 2) of this thesis, I illustrate the role of the auto-phosphorylation of BubR 1, a mitotic checkpoint protein, in kinetochore-microtubule attachment and the mitotic checkpoint. Using a phospho-specific antibody against the auto-phosphorylation site identified by mass spectrometry, I demonstrate that kinetochore-associated BubR 1 phosphorylates itself in human cells in vivo and that this phosphorylation is dependent on its binding partner, the kinetochore-associated kinesin motor CENP-E. Studies using cells expressing a non-phosphorylatable BubR 1 mutant revealed that the CENP-E-dependent BubR 1 phosphorylation at unattached kinetochores is important for a full-strength mitotic checkpoint to prevent single chromosome loss. Furthermore, replacing endogenous BubR 1 with the non-phosphorylatable BubR 1 mutant or depletion of CENP-E, the BubR 1 kinase activator, results in metaphase chromosome misalignment and increased incidents of syntelic attachments. Using indirect immunofluorescence, I have discovered a decreased level of Aurora B-mediated Ndc 80 phosphorylation at the kinetochore of cells expressing the non-phosphorylatable BubR 1 mutant, which might contribute to the <b>alignment</b> <b>defect.</b> Moreover, expressing a phosphomimetic BubR 1 mutant substantially reduces the incidence of polar chromosomes in CENP-E-depleted cells, further supporting a signaling cascade function of CENP-E and BubR 1 on the kinetochore. Thus, the state of CENP-E-dependent BubR 1 auto-phosphorylation in response to spindle microtubule capture by CENP-E is important for kinetochore functions in achieving accurate chromosome segregation. In the second part (Chapter 3), my colleague and I demonstrate a novel mechanism of mitotic spindle assembly in Xenopus egg extracts and mammalian cells. I show that the MRN (Mre 11, Rad 50, and Nbs 1) complex is required for metaphase chromosome alignment. Consistent with the result of my colleague using Xenopus egg extracts, disruption of MRN function by depleting Mre 11 using an inducible shRNA system, or Mre 11 inhibitor mirin, triggers a metaphase delay and disrupts the RCC 1 -dependent Ran-GTP gradient. Addition of mirin to mammalian cells reduces RCC 1 association with mitotic chromosomes and changes the confirmation of RCC 1. Thus, the MRN-CtIP pathway contributes to Ran-dependent mitotic spindle assembly by modulating RCC 1 chromosome association. In summary, my novel findings have revealed a pair of molecular mechanisms not known previously, which are important to the mitosis field...|$|E

The distance between astral microtubules ends and the anterior cortex was significantly increased in rab- 11 (RNAi) embryos specifically during metaphase, possibly accounting for the observed spindle <b>alignment</b> <b>defects.</b> Additionally, we found that normal ER morphology requires functional RAB- 11, particularly during metaphase.

We found that as the initial SHF population incorporates into the outflow tract, it is replenished from the surrounding progenitor territory. In retinoic acid (RA) receptor mutant mice, this latter process fails, and the outflow tract is shortened and misaligned as a result. As an additional consequence, the outflow tract is misspecified along its proximal-distal axis, which results in ectopic expression of TGFβ 2 and ectopic mesenchymal transformation of the endocardium.

Biochemical interaction between a COOH-terminal Xorbit fragment and the kinetochore-associated kinesin centromeric protein E may contribute to Xorbit's role in chromosome congression. We propose that Xorbit tethers dynamic MT plus ends to kinetochores and chromatin, providing a stabilizing activity that is crucial for spindle assembly and chromosome segregation...|$|R

Because photoalignment of LC wave plates is a non-contact process, it provides high-quality LC alignment without introducing particulate contamination on to the substrate. For the low-birefringence LC materials used for wave plate fabrication, the alignment quality produced using coumarin-based photopolymers is most greatly impacted by the surface quality and optical uniformity of the substrates. When substrates with relaxed scratch/dig, wedge and flatness tolerances were used, LC alignment was poor with numerous disclinations (<b>alignment</b> <b>defects).</b> When substrate quality was improved, the number of disclinations was vastly reduced.

40|$|The complex {{behavior}} of chromosomes during mitosis {{is accomplished by}} precise binding and highly regulated polymerization dynamics of kinetochore microtubules. Previous studies have implicated Kin Is, unique kinesins that depolymerize microtubules, in regulating chromosome positioning. We have characterized the immunofluorescence localization of centromere-bound MCAK and found that MCAK localized to inner kinetochores during prophase but was predominantly centromeric by metaphase. Interestingly, MCAK accumulated at leading kinetochores during congression but not during segregation. We tested the consequences of MCAK disruption by injecting a centromere dominantnegative protein into prophase cells. Depletion of centromeric MCAK led to reduced centromere stretch, delayed chromosome congression, <b>alignment</b> <b>defects,</b> and severe missegregation of chromosomes. Rates of chromosome movement were unchanged, suggesting that the primary role of MCAK is not to move chromosomes. Furthermore, we found that disruption of MCAK leads to multiple kinetochore–microtubule attachment defects, including merotelic, syntelic, and combined merotelic-syntelic attachments. These findings reveal an essential role for Kin Is in prevention and/or correction of improper kinetochore–microtubule attachments...|$|R

Moreover, regulated spindle orientation {{may be important}} for embryonic development, stem cell biology, and tumor growth. Drosophila neuroblasts align their spindle along an apical/basal cortical polarity axis to self-renew an apical neuroblast and generate a basal differentiating cell. It is unknown whether spindle alignment requires both apical and basal cues, nor have molecular motors been identified that regulate spindle movement. Using live imaging of neuroblasts within intact larval brains, we detect independent movement of both apical and basal spindle poles, suggesting that forces act on both poles. We show that reducing astral microtubules decreases the frequency of spindle movement, but not its maximum velocity, suggesting that one or few microtubules can move the spindle. Mutants in the Lis 1 /dynactin complex strongly decrease maximum and average spindle velocity, consistent with this motor complex mediating spindle/cortex forces. Loss of either astral microtubules or Lis 1 /dynactin leads to spindle/cortical polarity <b>alignment</b> <b>defects</b> at metaphase, but these are rescued by telophase.

Moreover, Aurora A disruption leads to cell death via a mechanism that involves aneuploidy generation. However, the link between the immediate functional consequences of Aurora A inhibition and the development of aneuploidy is not clearly defined. In this study, we delineate the sequence of events that lead to aneuploidy following Aurora A inhibition using MLN 8054, a selective Aurora A small-molecule inhibitor. Human tumor cells treated with MLN 8054 show a high incidence of abnormal mitotic spindles, often with unseparated centrosomes. Although these spindle defects result in mitotic delays, cells ultimately divide at a frequency near that of untreated cells. We show that many of the spindles in the dividing cells are bipolar, although they lack centrosomes at one or more spindle poles. MLN 8054 -treated cells frequently show <b>alignment</b> <b>defects</b> during metaphase, lagging chromosomes in anaphase, and chromatin bridges during telophase. Consistent with the chromosome segregation defects, cells treated with MLN 8054 develop aneuploidy over time. Taken together, these results suggest that Aurora A inhibition kills tumor cells through the development of deleterious aneuploidy...|$|R
40|$|In animals, {{the three}} main classes of small RNAs are microRNAs, short interfering RNAs, and PIWI-interacting RNAs. All three RNA species silence gene {{expression}} post-transcriptionally through interaction with the ARGONAUTE family of proteins. In mammals in particular, microRNAs are ubiquitously expressed, are essential for development, and perform numerous functions {{in a variety of}} cells and tissues. piRNAs are expressed almost exclusively in the germline, and are essential for male fertility and defense against transposons. Endogenous siRNAs are only expressed in germ cells and embryonic stem cells and have not been ascribed a functional role. By engineering a mouse that expresses a modified ARGONAUTE protein, we disrupt the function of endo-siRNAs exclusively in oocytes and find that females are infertile. Oocytes with an impaired siRNA pathway fail to complete meiosis I, and display severe spindle formation and chromosome <b>alignment</b> <b>defects.</b> Their transcriptome is widely perturbed and expression of the most abundant transposon is increased. These findings indicate that endo-siRNAs are essential for female fertility in mouse, are required for spindle formation, chromosome congression, and defense against transposons. This study unequivocally demonstrates an essential function for siRNAs in mammals, mediated through endonucleolytic cleavage of targets, and provides an explanation for the selective pressure that one AGO protein retains catalytic activity...|$|R
40|$|Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk 1) is {{absolutely}} essential for cell division. Complete ablation of Cdk 1 precludes the entry of G 2 phase cells into mitosis, and is early embryonic lethal in mice. Dampening Cdk 1 activation, by reducing gene expression or upon treatment with cell-permeable Cdk 1 inhibitors, is also detrimental for proliferating cells, but {{has been associated with}} defects in mitotic progression, and the formation of aneuploid daughter cells. Here, we used a large-scale RNAi screen to identify the human genes that critically determine the cellular toxicity of Cdk 1 inhibition. We show that Cdk 1 inhibition leads to fatal sister chromatid alignment errors and mitotic arrest in the spindle checkpoint. These problems start early in mitosis and are alleviated by depletion of isoform 1 of PRC 1 (PRC 1 - 1), by gene ablation of its binding partner KIF 4, or by abrogation of KIF 4 motor activity. Our results show that, normally, Cdk 1 activity must rise above the level required for mitotic entry. This prevents KIF 4 -dependent PRC 1 - 1 translocation to astral microtubule tips and safeguards proper chromosome congression. We conclude that cell death in response to Cdk 1 inhibitors directly relates to chromosome <b>alignment</b> <b>defects</b> generated by insufficient repression of PRC 1 - 1 and KIF 4 during prometaphase...|$|R
40|$|SummaryFractures of the tibial plateau are in {{constant}} progression. They affect an elderly population {{suffering from a}} number of comorbidities, but also a young population increasingly practicing high-risk sports and using two-wheeled vehicles. The objective of this study was therefore to propose a new technique for the treatment of this type of fracture. There are a variety of classical pitfalls of conservative treatment such as defective reduction resulting in early osteoarthritis and <b>alignment</b> <b>defects.</b> Conventional treatments lead to joint stiffness and amyotrophy of the quadriceps, caused by the open technique and late loading. We propose an osteosynthesis technique for tibial plateau fractures with minimally invasive surgery. A minimally invasive technique would be more appropriate to remedy all of the surgical drawbacks resulting from current practices. The surgical technique that we propose uses a balloon allowing progressive and total reduction, associated with percutaneous screw fixation and filling with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement. The advantages are optimal reduction, minimal devascularization, soft tissues kept intact, as well as early loading and mobilization. This simple technique seems to be a good alternative to conventional treatment. The most comminuted fractures as well as the most posterior compressions can be treated, while causing the least impairment possible. Arthroscopy can be used to verify fracture reduction and cement leakage. At the same time, {{it can be used to}} assess the associated meniscal lesions and to repair them if necessary...|$|R

However, {{little attention has}} been paid to the aging effect during ferroelectric-ferroelectric phase transitions that is essentially correlated with real applications. In this letter, the authors report the aging effect evolution between two ferroelectric phases in an acceptor-doped piezoceramics. The results show that aging-induced double hysteresis loops were exhibited in different ferroelectric phases, but disappeared during ferroelectric-ferroelectric phase transitions, suggesting the mechanism that the intrinsic restoring force for the reversible switching of domains caused by the <b>alignment</b> of <b>defect</b> dipoles was weakened due to ferroelectric dipole reorientation...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{growth of}} the {{embryonic}} heart occurs by addition of progenitor cells of the second heart field to the poles of the elongating heart tube. Failure or perturbation of this process leads to congenital heart defects. In order to provide further insight into second heart field development we characterized the insertion site of a transgene expressed in the second heart field and outflow tract {{as the result of}} an integration site position effect. Here we show that the integration site of the A 17 -Myf 5 -nlacZ-T 55 transgene lies upstream of Hes 1, encoding a basic helix-loop-helix containing transcriptional repressor required for the maintenance of diverse progenitor cell populations during embryonic development. Transgene expression in a subset of Hes 1 expression sites, including the CNS, pharyngeal epithelia, pericardium, limb bud and lung endoderm suggests that Hes 1 is the endogenous target of regulatory elements trapped by the transgene. Hes 1 is expressed in pharyngeal endoderm and mesoderm including the second heart field. Analysis of Hes 1 mutant hearts at embryonic day 15. 5 reveals outflow tract <b>alignment</b> <b>defects</b> including ventricular septal defects and overriding aorta. At earlier developmental stages, Hes 1 mutant embryos display defects in second heart field proliferation, a reduction in cardiac neural crest cells and failure to completely extend the outflow tract. Hes 1 is expressed in cardiac progenitor cells in the early embryo and is required for development of the arterial pole of the heart...|$|R
40|$|Microtubule inhibitors are {{invaluable}} {{tools in}} cancer chemotherapy: taxanes and vinca alkaloids {{have been successfully}} used in the clinic over {{the past thirty years}} against a broad range of tumors. However, two factors have limited the effectiveness of microtubule inhibitors: toxicity and resistance. In particular, the latter is highly unpredictable, variable from patient to patient and {{is believed to be the}} cause of treatment failure in most cases of metastatic cancers. For these reasons, there is an increasing demand for new microtubule inhibitors that can overcome resistance mechanisms and that, at the same time, have reduced side effects. Here we present a novel microtubule inhibitor, 4 SC- 207, which shows strong anti-proliferative activity in a large panel of tumor cell lines with an average GI 50 of 11 nM. In particular, 4 SC- 207 is active in multi-drug resistant cell lines, such as HCT- 15 and ACHN, suggesting that it is a poor substrate for drug efflux pumps. 4 SC- 207 inhibits microtubule growth in vitro and in vivo and promotes, in a dose dependent manner, a mitotic delay/arrest, followed by apoptosis or aberrant divisions due to chromosome <b>alignment</b> <b>defects</b> and formation of multi-polar spindles. Furthermore, preliminary data from preclinical studies suggest low propensity towards bone marrow toxicities at concentrations that inhibit tumor growth in paclitaxel-resistant xenograft models. In summary, our results suggest that 4 SC- 207 may be a potential anti-cancer agent...|$|R
40|$|Mitosis is an {{attractive}} target {{for the development of}} new anticancer drugs. In a search for novel mitotic inhibitors, we virtually screened for low molecular weight compounds that would possess similar steric and electrostatic features, but different chemical structure than rigosertib (ON 01910. Na), a putative inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) and polo-like kinase 1 (Plk 1) pathways. Highest scoring hit compounds were tested in cell-based assays for their ability to induce mitotic arrest. We identified a novel acridinyl-acetohy-drazide, here named as Centmitor- 1 (Cent- 1), that possesses highly similar molecular interaction field as rigosertib. In cells, Cent- 1 phenocopied the cellular effects of rigosertib and caused mitotic arrest characterized by chromosome <b>alignment</b> <b>defects,</b> multipolar spindles, centrosome fragmentation, and activated spindle assembly checkpoint. We compared the effects of Cent- 1 and rigosertib on microtubules and found that both compoundsmodulatedmicrotubule plus-ends and reducedmicrotubule dynamics. Also,mitotic spindle forces were affected by the compounds as tension across sister kinetochores was reduced in mitotic cells. Our results showed that both Cent- 1 and rigosertib target processes that occur during mitosis as they had immediate antimitotic effectswhen added to cells duringmitosis. Analysis of Plk 1 activity in cells using a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) -based assay indicated that neither compound affected the activity of the kinase. Taken together, these findings suggest that Cent- 1 and rigosertib elicit their antimitotic effects by targeting mitotic processes without impairment of Plk 1 kinase activity.

40|$|The spindle {{assembly}} checkpoint monitors {{the status of}} kinetochore–microtubule (K-MT) attachments and delays anaphase onset until full metaphase alignment is achieved. Recently, the role of {{spindle assembly}} checkpoint proteins was expanded with the discovery that BubR 1 and Bub 1 are implicated in the regulation of K-MT attachments. One unsolved question is whether Bub 3, known to form cell cycle constitutive complexes with both BubR 1 and Bub 1, is also required for proper chromosome-to-spindle attachments. Using RNA interference and high-resolution microscopy, we analyzed K-MT interactions in Bub 3 -depleted cells and compared them to those in Bub 1 - or BubR 1 -depleted cells. We found that Bub 3 {{is essential for the}} establishment of correct K-MT attachments. In contrast to BubR 1 depletion, which severely compromises chromosome attachment and alignment, we found Bub 3 and Bub 1 depletions to produce defective K-MT attachments that, however, still account for significant chromosome congression. After Aurora B inhibition, <b>alignment</b> <b>defects</b> become severer in Bub 3 - and Bub 1 -depleted cells, while partially rescued in BubR 1 -depleted cells, suggesting that Bub 3 and Bub 1 depletions perturb K-MT attachments distinctly from BubR 1. Interestingly, misaligned chromosomes in Bub 3 - and Bub 1 -depleted cells were found to be predominantly bound in a side-on configuration. We propose that Bub 3 promotes the formation of stable end-on bipolar attachments. Cooperativa de Ensino Superior Politécnico e Universitário (CESPU).
