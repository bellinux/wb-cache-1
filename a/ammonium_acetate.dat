40|$|The {{influence}} of the BGE composition, including {{the addition of a}} single-isomer sulfated beta-CD derivative, on the ionization performance of the model compound carvedilol in NACE-ESI-MS was studied using an alternative infusion method. This approach employs voltage-induced infusion of the BGE containing the analyte, and takes into account the effects of variations in EOF and effective analyte mobility on the ESI-MS intensity. First, the optimal composition of the sheath liquid for CE-MS in terms of signal abundance and stability was determined. The BGE <b>ammonium</b> formate, <b>acetate,</b> and camphorsulfonate were found to have similar effects on analyte ionization. Addition of single-isomer sulfated beta-CD derivatives (available as sodium salt) to the BGE revealed that the anionic CD derivatives did not give rise to the same ionization suppression effect. This result can be attributed to differences in the dissociation state of these sodium salts. Finally, it is shown that information about chiral selectivity can also be obtained with the applied infusion method. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Na+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase (Na+,K+-ATPase) is an {{integral}} protein usually located in the basolateral membrane [1, 2] that actively pumps Na+ out and K+ in to the cell, through ATP hydrolysis [3]. The activity of Na+,K+-ATPase {{is essential for the}} existence of water and solute transport by epithelial cells [4, 5]. Measurement of Na+,K+-ATPase activity is usually done by biochemical assays. Cytochemical methods [6] allow cellular enzyme localization and may offer an alternative approach for determination of Na+,K+-ATPase activity in disrupted cells. We have used a cytochemical method, based on measurements of inorganic phosphate generated during ATP hydrolysis by ATPases during the incubation period and precipitated by a lead <b>ammonium</b> citrate <b>acetate</b> complex (LACA) as lead phosphate [Pb 3 (PO 4) 2]. The colorless lead phosphate was converted into a brown precipitate of lead sulphide (PbS) by treatment with ammonium sulphide. We chose to evaluate Na+,K+-ATPase activity in MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells because they retain many differentiated properties characteristic of distal tubule epithelia [4, 7]. In these cells, apical to basolateral salt and water transport was shown to be inhibited by ouabain and amiloride [7 – 10]. We show that this method is a simple, convenient, and could be easily performed to measure Na+,K+-ATPase activity and its modulation under physiological conditions...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effect of}} ammonium and temperature on methane production in high rate upflow anaerobic sludge bed reactors treating pig manure supernatant. We operated four reactors at two ammonium concentrations (‘low’ at 1. 9, ‘high’ at 3. 7 [*]g[*]L− 1, termed LA and HA reactors, respectively) and at variable temperatures over 358 days. Archaeal and bacterial communities were characterized by Illumina sequencing of 16 S rRNA amplicons. Ammonium was a major selective factor for bacterial and archaeal community structure. After ~ 200 days of adaptation to high <b>ammonium</b> levels, <b>acetate</b> and propionate removal and methane production improved substantially in HA reactors. Aceticlastic Methanosaeta was abundant and positively correlated to methane yield in the HA reactors, whereas Methanosarcina was more abundant in LA reactors. Furthermore, a group of monophyletic OTUs that was related to Thaumarchaeota in phylogenetic analysis was highly abundant in the archaeal communities, particularly in the HA reactors. The most abundant bacterial OTU in LA reactors, representing Syntrophomonadaceae, was also positively correlated to methane yield in the HA reactors, indicating its importance in methane production under ammonia stress.

40|$|The {{current work}} investigates the {{capability}} of a tailored multivariate curve resolution–alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) algorithm to analyse glucose, phosphate, <b>ammonium</b> and <b>acetate</b> dynamics simultaneously in an E. coli BL 21 fed-batch fermentation. The high-cell-density (HCDC) process is monitored by ex situ online attenuated total reflection (ATR) Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and several in situ online process sensors. This approach efficiently utilises automatically generated process data to reduce the time and cost consuming reference measurement effort for multivariate calibration. To determine metabolite concentrations with accuracies between ± 0. 19 and ± 0. 96 ·gL−l, the presented utilisation needs primarily—besides online sensor measurements—single FTIR measurements {{for each of the}} components of interest. The ambiguities in alternating least squares solutions for concentration estimation are reduced by the insertion of analytical process knowledge primarily in the form of elementary carbon mass balances. Thus, in this way, the established idea of mass balance constraints in MCR combines with the consistency check of measured data by carbon balances, as commonly applied in bioprocess engineering. The constraints are calculated based on online process data and theoretical assumptions. This increased calculation effort is able to replace, to a large extent, the need for manually conducted quantitative chemical analysis, leads to good estimations of concentration profiles and a better process understanding...|$|R

50|$|In {{the case}} of {{transmission}} electron microscopy, opaqueness to electrons {{is related to the}} atomic number, i.e., the number of protons. Some suitable negative stains include <b>ammonium</b> molybdate, uranyl <b>acetate,</b> uranyl formate, phosphotungstic acid, osmium tetroxide, osmium ferricyanide and auroglucothionate.

Here, the method is used to view viruses, bacteria, bacterial flagella, biological membrane structures and proteins or protein aggregates, which all have a low electron-scattering power. Some stains, such as osmium tetroxide and osmium ferricyanide, are very chemically active.

40|$|Intracellular H+ ion {{mobility}} in eukaryotic {{cells is}} low because of intracellular buffering. We have investigated whether Hi+ mobility varies with pHi. A dual microperfusion apparatus {{was used to}} expose guinea-pig or rat myocytes to small localized doses (3 - 5 mm) of ammonium chloride (applied in Hepes-buffered solution). Intracellular pH (pHi) was monitored confocally using the fluorescent dye, carboxy-SNARF- 1. Local ammonium exposure produced a stable, longitudinal pHi gradient. Its size was fed into a look-up table (LUT) to give {{an estimate of the}} apparent intracellular proton diffusion coefficient (D(app) H). LUTs were generated using a diffusion-reaction model of Hi+ mobility based on intracellular buffer diffusion. To examine the pHi sensitivity of D(app) H, whole-cell pHi was initially displaced using a whole-cell <b>ammonium</b> or <b>acetate</b> prepulse, before locally applying the low dose of ammonium. In both rat and guinea-pig, D(app) H decreased with pHi over the range 7. 5 - 6. 5. In separate pipette-loading experiments, the intracellular diffusion coefficient for carboxy-SNARF- 1 (a mobile-buffer analogue) exhibited no significant pHi dependence. The pHi sensitivity of D(app) H is thus likely to be governed by the mobile fraction of intrinsic buffering capacity. These results reinforce the buffer hypothesis of Hi+ mobility. The pHi dependence of D(app) H was used to characterize the mobile and fixed buffer components, and to estimate D(mob) (the average diffusion coefficient for intracellular mobile buffer). One consequence of a decline in Hi+ mobility at low pHi is that it will predispose the myocardium to pHi nonuniformity. The physiological relevance of this is discussed...|$|R
