On third down, he broke free of the Virginia Tech defense and gained 20 yards and a first down at the Tech 33-yard line. Two more rushes gained three yards and ran the {{remaining}} time off the game clock. Time expired, and North Carolina won the 1998 Gator Bowl, 423.|$|E
5|$|Fans {{and writers}} regard the treble haul as manager Alex Ferguson's finest hour, {{although}} he dismissed that assertion in later years. Tens {{of thousands of}} fans lined the streets of Manchester to welcome the team as the season drew to a close.

5|$|Model {{believed}} that the situation represented not just a threat, but also an opportunity to counter-attack and possibly clear the Allies out of the Southern Netherlands. Towards this end, he forbade SS General Willi Bittrich and SS Lieutenant General Heinz Harmel, commanding II SS Panzer Corps and 10th SS Panzer respectively, from destroying the Nijmegen bridge. With the exception of this tactical error, Model is considered to have fought an outstanding battle <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>the</b> Allies a sharp defeat. The bridge at Arnhem was held and the 1st Airborne Division destroyed, dashing the Allies' hopes for a foothold over the Rhine {{before the end of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the lecture}} room before the {{students}} arrived, according to testimony Starling and others gave in court, Starling cut the dog open again {{to inspect the}} results of the previous surgery, which took about 45 minutes, after which he clamped the wound with forceps <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>the</b> dog over to Bayliss. Bayliss cut a new opening in the dog's neck to expose the lingual nerves of the salivary glands, to which he attached electrodes. The aim was to stimulate the nerves with electricity to demonstrate that salivary pressure was independent of blood pressure. The dog was then carried to the lecture theatre, stretched on his back on an operating board, with his legs tied to the board, his head clamped and his mouth muzzled.|$|E
5|$|Tallon {{retired in}} {{dramatic}} circumstances {{after the first}} match of the 195354 Sheffield Shield season. During the match, he suddenly took off his gloves <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>the</b> keeping duties to Peter Burge. He scored 21 and 54 not out in a drawn match against New South Wales. Two months later, he played for Arthur Morris's XI against Hassett's XI, a testimonial match for the latter. Tallon made 17 not out and nine in a 121-run win. Tallon continued to play local cricket in Bundaberg for another decade.|$|E

5|$|Wales was unbeaten in 1908 and 1909. At {{the end of}} the 1907–08 season, {{in which}} Williams was again top try scorer for Cardiff with 13 tries, Williams was part of Arthur Harding's Anglo-Welsh team that toured the Antipodes. Although an {{unsuccessful}} tour, he played well and ended as the team's top try scorer. He then missed the start of the 1908–09 season and did not return to Cardiff until November. The club faced Australia on 28 December 1908, <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>the</b> tourists the biggest defeat of their tour, 24–8, Williams providing two tries. Cardiff finished the season as Welsh Champions, Williams having scored 15 tries in 26 appearances, to Spiller's 16 in 27.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, Skanderbeg {{celebrated the}} event by dining off letnica (Ohrid trout), a fish found in Lake Ohrid {{that was sent}} to the Byzantine {{emperors}} every Friday for their supper meal. The twelve captured officers were ransomed for 40,000 ducats. Skanderbeg distributed this amount through his force, with every man receiving his fair share. He then besieged Ohrid for a short time before returning to Albania; the Venetian Senate hailed the campaign as a victory despite not being able to take Ohrid. The crusade seemed to have gone well for the Christian side but, after Pius' death, the remaining cardinals lost their hope <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>the</b> money raised for the crusade to the Venetians. Mehmed saw Skanderbeg's vulnerability and sent Ballaban Badera, an Albanian janissary, to Albania where they met at Vaikal and he was defeated. Ballaban had replaced Şeremet as the commander in Ohrid after the latter fell out of favor with the sultan. Ballaban would meet Skanderbeg several more times in battle before being mortally wounded in action at the second siege of Krujë.|$|E
5|$|André faced Hogan for {{the title}} on the February 5, 1988 {{broadcast}} of The Main Event, with Dave Hebner as the scheduled referee. André pinned Hogan to win the championship <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>the</b> belt to DiBiase. The pinfall was controversial, however, as Hogan's shoulders {{were not on the}} mat when the referee made the three count. After the match, the real Dave Hebner, who looked identical to referee that had officiated the match, ran to the ring to attack the impostor referee. Hulk Hogan then threw the impostor out of the ring onto DiBiase and his bodyguard Virgil. According to the storyline, DiBiase had paid an unnamed referee to get plastic surgery to look exactly like Dave Hebner. In reality, the second referee was Dave's twin brother Earl Hebner, who was making his on-screen debut with the WWF.|$|E

5|$|K5054 {{was fitted}} with a new propeller, and Summers flew the {{aircraft}} on 10 March 1936; during this flight the undercarriage was retracted for the first time. After the fourth flight, a new engine was fitted, and Summers left the test-flying to his assistants, Jeffrey Quill and George Pickering. They soon discovered that the Spitfire {{was a very good}} aircraft, but not perfect. The rudder was over-sensitive and the top speed was just 330mph (528km/h), little faster than Sydney Camm's new Merlin-powered Hurricane. A new and better-shaped wooden propeller allowed the Spitfire to reach 348mph (557km/h) in level flight in mid-May, when Summers flew K5054 to RAF Martlesham Heath <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>the</b> aircraft over to Squadron Leader Anderson of the Aeroplane & Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE). Here, Flight Lieutenant Humphrey Edwardes-Jones took over the prototype for the RAF. He had been given orders to fly the aircraft and then to make his report to the Air Ministry on landing. Edwardes-Jones' report was positive; his only request was that the Spitfire be equipped with an undercarriage position indicator. A week later, on 3 June 1936, the Air Ministry placed an order for 310 Spitfires, before any formal report had been issued by the A&AEE. Interim reports were later issued on a piecemeal basis.|$|E

Wales led 15–0 after 15 minutes and 18–15 at half-time, and though England managed to draw level in the second half, James Hook then kicked two penalties and a drop goal, to give Wales the victory by 27–18. This result confirmed France's position as champions <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>the</b> wooden spoon to Scotland, both on points difference.|$|E

These disparate voting blocs together formed a broad majority <b>and</b> <b>handed</b> <b>the</b> Democrats seven victories out of nine presidential elections to come, as well as control of both houses of Congress during much of this time.
