In the lieutenant governor's race, Democrat James Breathitt, Jr. defeated Sampson's running mate, E. E. Nelson, by 159 votes out of more than 700,000 cast. It was estimated that the Jockey Club spent half <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> defeat Beckham and the large majority for Sampson versus the close defeat of all other Republican candidates suggested some type of fraud, although none was ever proven.|$|E
5|$|While {{negotiating}} the rights {{for his third}} independent film, Cagney starred in 20th Century Fox's 13 Rue Madeleine for $300,000 for two months of work. The wartime spy film was a success, and Cagney was keen to begin production of his new project, an adaptation of William Saroyan's Broadway play The Time of Your Life. Saroyan himself loved the film, {{but it was a}} commercial disaster, costing the company half <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> make; audiences again struggled to accept Cagney in a nontough-guy role.|$|E
5|$|In Return of the Jedi, Jabba {{is portrayed}} by a one-ton puppet that took {{three months and}} half <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> construct. While filming the movie, the puppet had its own makeup artist. The puppet {{required}} three puppeteers to operate, {{making it one of}} the largest ever used in a motion picture. Stuart Freeborn designed the puppet, while John Coppinger sculpted its latex, clay, and foam pieces. Puppeteers included David Alan Barclay, Toby Philpott, and Mike Edmonds, who were members of Jim Henson's Muppet group. Barclay operated the right arm and mouth and read the character's English dialogue, while Philpott controlled the left arm, head, and tongue. Edmonds, the shortest of the three men (he also played the Ewok Logray in later scenes) was responsible for the movement of Jabba's tail. Tony Cox, who also played an Ewok, would assist as well. The eyes and facial expressions were operated by radio control.|$|E

I said, where'd you hear that? I did it in two days. He said, Jimmy Iovine. So I went to Jimmy Iovine and I said all that to his, yeah it's true, I know. I blamed you but you can't be upset with me.

25|$|As {{the vast}} {{majority}} of Raytheon's revenues have been obtained from defense contracts, there has been a tight relationship of cooperation between itself and the U.S. Department of Defense and other U.S. government departments and agencies (e.g. in the Fiscal Year 2007 the National Science Foundation awarded Raytheon $152 million in grants, more than to any other institution and organization in the country, for managing NSF South Pole Station). This, along with heavy lobbying, has led to perennial charges of influence peddling. Raytheon, for instance, contributed nearly <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> various defense-related political campaigns in the presidential election year of 2004, spending much more than that on lobbying expenses. And there are many tight ties between the company and all levels of government. For example, Richard Armitage, a former United States Deputy Secretary of State, is linked to the company through consultancy work. John M. Deutch, a former U.S. Director of Central Intelligence, sits on the board of directors, along with Warren Rudman, a former Senator. On the other hand, Raytheon has also been involved in several contract disputes with the U.S. Government.|$|E

500|$|The UFC {{also began}} a public {{relations}} campaign to discredit the Guatemalan government; it hired Edward Bernays, who mounted a concerted misinformation campaign for several years which portrayed the company as {{the victim of a}} communist Guatemalan government. The company stepped up its efforts after Dwight Eisenhower was elected U.S. President in 1952. These included commissioning a research study from a firm known to be hostile to social reform, which produced a 235-page report that was highly critical of the Guatemalan government. Historians have stated that the report was full of [...] "exaggerations, scurrilous descriptions and bizarre historical theories" [...] but it nonetheless {{had a significant impact on}} the members of Congress who read it. Overall, the company spent over half <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> convince lawmakers and the American public that the Guatemalan government needed to be overthrown.|$|E

500|$|In 1929, Smythe decided, in {{the midst}} of the Great Depression, that the Maple Leafs needed a new arena. The Arena Gardens seated 8,000 and the Maple Leafs were {{regularly}} filling it with 9,000 customers. Smythe knew it would take over <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> construct and he got backing from the Sun Life insurance company for half a million. [...] He found a site owned by the T. Eaton Co. department store chain on Carlton Street, a site Smythe selected because it was on the street car line. Smythe gave up the coaching position to concentrate on the arena project. The building started construction on June 1, 1931, and was ready on November 12, 1931, after five months. As part of a corporate reorganization, Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. was founded that year to own both the team and the arena. To pay for the building construction, the construction workers were paid with Maple Leaf Gardens stock instead of 20% of their pay. Selke, who had union connections, and Smythe were successful in negotiating the payment method in exchange for using unionized workers.|$|E

[...] This dichotomy could not have been illustrated better than a deal negotiated at the Senior Championship event. Tony Korfman wanted the money while Ernest Bennett wanted the glory. [...] Rather than leave their fates to chance, the two of them ensured they got what they wanted. In exchange for splitting the prize money, Korfman agreed to let Bennett win the bracelet. [...] After winning $8.25million in the Main Event, Jerry Yang and his wife retired. [...] "My winning today also means a lot to me, because I know that I can use this money {{to do a lot of}} good for other people out there," [...] Yang said before donating over <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> charity.

500|$|In his autobiography, Cagney {{said that}} as a young man, he had no {{political}} views, since he was more concerned with where the next meal was coming from. [...] However, the emerging labor movement of the 1920s and 1930s soon forced him to take sides. The first version of the National Labor Relations Act was passed in 1935 and growing tensions between labor and management fueled the movement. Fanzines in the 1930s, however, described his politics as [...] "radical". This somewhat exaggerated view was enhanced by his public contractual wranglings with Warner Bros. at the time, his joining of the Screen Actors Guild in 1933, and {{his involvement in the}} revolt against the so-called [...] "Merriam tax". The [...] "Merriam tax" [...] was an underhanded method of funneling studio funds to politicians; during the 1934 Californian gubernatorial campaign, the studio executives would 'tax' their actors, automatically taking a day's pay from their biggest-earners, ultimately sending nearly half <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> the gubernatorial campaign of Frank Merriam. Cagney (as well as Jean Harlow) publicly refused to pay and Cagney even threatened that, if the studios took a day's pay for Merriam's campaign, he would give a week's pay to Upton Sinclair, Merriam's opponent in the race.|$|E

500|$|Conant {{returned}} to the United States in February 1957, and moved to an apartment on the Upper East Side of New York. Between 1957 and 1965, the Carnegie Corporation of New York gave him over <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> write studies of education. [...] In 1959 he published The American High School Today. This became a best seller, resulting in Conant's appearance {{on the cover of}} Time magazine on September 14, 1959. In it, Conant called for a number of reforms, including the consolidation of high schools into larger bodies that could offer a broader range of curriculum choices. Although it was slammed by critics of the American system, who hoped for a system of education based on the European model, it did lead to a wave of reforms across the country. His subsequent Slums and Suburbs in 1961 was far more controversial in its treatment of racial issues. Regarding busing as impractical, Conant urged Americans [...] "to accept de facto segregated schools". This did not go over well with civil rights groups, and by 1964 Conant was forced to admit that he had been wrong. In The Education of American Teachers in 1963, Conant found much to criticize about the training of teachers. Most controversial was his defense of the arrangement by which teachers were certified by independent bodies rather than the teacher training colleges.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{returned}} to the Capitals for {{the last half of}} the 2009/2010 season. The Capitals started an effort to re-sign Jackson, and in March 2011, she signed a contract for <b>a</b> <b>million</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> play in the WNBL. [...] This was the most an Australian woman had ever been offered to play for a domestic side in the country, with most of the top women earning only $50,000 a year. Despite returning to Australia and being present at every Capitals game, injuries prevented Jackson from playing in the 2012–13 NBDL season. For the 2013–14 season, the Capitals missed the deadline date to sign Jackson and led her to play in China instead. Jackson was signed for the Capitals' next two seasons, and expected to join the team in November 2014, after recovering from a hip surgery she went through in September. Jackson's return happened in December 19 against the Adelaide Lightning. Jackson managed to play five more games in the 2014–15 WNBL season, losing only one as she averaged 13 points and seven rebounds. [...] Still her physical ailments prevented Jackson from training with her teammates, and requiring weekly drainings of synovial fluid out of her knee. During a double-header road trip in Victoria, Jackson's knee gave in. A subsequent MRI scan showed further damage to her knee that required new surgeries, forcing Jackson to sit out the rest of the season. The Capitals released Jackson from her contract in January 2016.|$|E
