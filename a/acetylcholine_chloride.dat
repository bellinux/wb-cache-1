40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{test the}} {{efficacy}} of <b>Acetylcholine</b> <b>chloride</b> use in obtaining intraoperative miosis on phacoemulsification cataract surgery. Methods: Patients with cataract diagnosis and elected for surgical phacoemulsification procedure were selected. All patients underwent conventional phacoemulsification procedure performed by a single surgeon and all patients had 0. 2 ml of <b>Acetylcholine</b> <b>chloride</b> 1 % irrigated in the anterior chamber {{at the end of}} the surgery. The pupillary diameter was measured immediately before the beginning of surgery, immediately before and two minutes after the use of <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>chloride</b> 1 %. Results: A total of 30 eyes from 30 patients were included in the study. 18 were female, and mean age was of 69. 5 years with a 7. 2 y standard deviation on the population study. The mean pupillary diameter immediately before the beginning of surgery was 7. 5 mm with a standard deviation of 0. 56 mm; the mean pupillary diameter immediately before the <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>chloride</b> 1 % use (after the intraocular lens im-plantation) was 7. 1 mm with a standard deviation of 0. 57 mm. The mean pupillary diameter two minutes after the use of <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>chloride</b> 1 % in the anterior chamber was 3. 4 mm with standard deviation of 0. 66 mm. The mean maximum action time of ACH chloride 1 % was 64 seconds, with a standard deviation of 8 seconds. The mean intraocular pressure on the first postoperative day was 19. 1 mmHg with a standard deviation of 2. 45 mmHg. Conclusion: We conclude that <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>chloride</b> 1 % is an important drug to obtaining intraoperative miosis in cataract surgery...|$|E

The activity of suxamethonium and decamethonium in the cat was reduced. On the rat phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation, pretreatment with SKF 525 A abolished both the mutual antagonism between suxamethonium and tubocurarine and the antagonizing effect of tetraethylammonium against suxamethonium.

40|$|Airway hyperreactivity (AHR) {{measurements}} and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid sampling {{are essential to}} experimental asthma models, but repeated procedures to obtain such measurements in the same animal are generally not feasible. Here, we demonstrate protocols for obtaining from mice repeated measurements of AHR and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples. Mice were challenged intranasally seven times over 14 days with a potent allergen or sham treated. Prior to the initial challenge, and within 24 hours following each intranasal challenge, the same animals were anesthetized, orally intubated and mechanically ventilated. AHR, assessed by comparing dose response curves of respiratory system resistance (RRS) induced by increasing intravenous doses of <b>acetylcholine</b> (Ach) <b>chloride</b> between sham and allergen-challenged animals, were determined. Afterwards, and via the same intubation, the left lung was lavaged so that differential enumeration of airway cells could be performed. These studies reveal that repeated measurements of AHR and BAL fluid collection are possible from the same animals and that maximal airway hyperresponsiveness and airway eosinophilia are achieved within 7 - 10 days of initiating allergen challenge.

40|$|The {{effects of}} i. v. and local {{anaesthetics}} on guineapig tracheal smooth muscle {{have been investigated}} in vitro. Diazepam, propanidid and ketamine induced relaxation and antagonized histamine-, acetyl-choline- and potassium chloride-induced contractures in the tracheal smooth muscle. The relaxing effects of the anaesthetics were not affected by propranolol. Thiopentone, at concentrations which would be used clinically, caused contracture of the tracheal smooth muscle. Morphine induced relaxation and antagonized histamine-induced contracture, but did not antagonize acetylcholine- or potassium chloride-induced contractures. Lignocaine and procaine, at clinical concentrations, induced contracture of tracheal smooth muscle.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to test {{the effect of a}} range of chemicals on larval responses in swimming behaviour, attachment and metamorphosis of the black-footed abalone (Haliotis iris). The effect of antibiotics on larval survival was first tested within negative (filtered seawater) and positive (GABA at 10 − 5, 10 − 4 and 10 − 3 mol L− 1) control assays over 3 days. This experiment corroborated the effectiveness of using antibiotics to improve survival of larvae without obvious synergistic interactions with the GABA inducer or confounding effects of potential bacterial interactions. Chemical treatments (<b>acetylcholine,</b> potassium <b>chloride,</b> dopamine and glutamine) were then tested at various concentrations for their ability to modulate swimming behaviour and induce larval attachment and metamorphosis over 14 days. Generally, larval state shifted from swimming to attached, and from attached to metamorphosed, in the control and treatments over time. However, the peak percentage of attached and metamorphosed larvae varied in time among chemicals and concentrations. While overall percent metamorphosis was minimally enhanced after 14 days of exposure to some chemical treatments at certain concentrations, all treatments displayed significant capacities to down-regulate larval swimming and induce early attachment and metamorphosis. Mortality was recorded throughout the duration of the experiment, and was generally low (< 20 %) across controls and most treatments for exposures of less than 12 days. Interpretations of specific results from this study are used to elucidate neurophysiological control of larval activities for this abalone species.

40|$|Objective To examine digital {{microvascular}} {{responses in}} patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon (PRP) and systemic sclerosis (SSc), and compare these to the responses in healthy control subjects. Methods Digital microvascular responses to repeated episodes of iontophoresis of <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>chloride</b> (endothelial-dependent), sodium nitroprusside (endothelial-independant) and adrenaline were measured using dual-channel laser Doppler in 8 healthy control subjects, 8 patients with PRP and 8 patients with SSc. Results There {{were no significant differences}} in responses between groups. For each chemical the greatest response was generally seen in period 7 of the protocol (after the third episode of iontophoresis). For <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>chloride</b> in period 7, the age and baseline adjusted ratio of the maximum response of PRP to control was 0. 93, 95 % CI (0. 26, 3. 38) and for SSc to control it was 0. 60, 95 % CI (0. 13, 2. 81). For sodium nitroprusside in period 7, this age and baseline adjusted ratio of the maximum response of PRP to control was 1. 31, 95 % CI (0. 74, 2. 32) and for SSc to control it was 1. 35, 95 % CI (0. 68, 2. 67). For adrenaline in period 7, the age and baseline adjusted ratio of PRP to control was 1. 51, 95 % CI (0. 79, 2. 89) and for SSc to control it was 2. 18, 95 % CI (1. 01, 4. 69). Conclusion This study demonstrates the usefulness of iontophoresis of vasoactive chemicals, combined with laser Doppler blood flowmetry, in the non-invasive assessment of dermal microvascular responses. One possible explanation for the lack of difference in responses between groups is that vasoactive chemicals other than those discussed are important in the pathophysiology of primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon...|$|E

We studied the efficacy of flecainide acetate on reperfusion- and barium-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias in the isolated perfused rat heart by monitoring heart rate, coronary flow rate, left ventricular systolic pressure, dp/dtmax, and the voltage of the epicardial electrogram. Seventy-five male rats were randomized into 5 groups. In group I, after a 15 min period of stabilization, hearts were perfused by ischemic perfusion and then reperfused. In group II, flecainide acetate (10 (- 6) M) was given after stabilization and before ischaemic perfusion. In group III, barium chloride (10 (- 3) M) was given after stabilization. In group IV, flecainide acetate was given after stabilization and before barium chloride administration. In group V, <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>chloride</b> (10 (- 6) M) was given after stabilization and before barium chloride administration. In group I, we noted during ischemia a reduction in heart rate, coronary flow rate, left ventricular systolic pressure and dp/dtmax {{and an increase in}} the voltage of the epicardial electrogram. In group II, after administration of flecainide acetate, we observed a reduction in heart rate, left ventricular systolic pressure and dp/dtmax; during the ischaemic period {{there was no difference in}} these parameters with respect to group I. Reperfusion induced ventricular arrhythmias in 12 out of 15 hearts in group I and in only 3 out of 15 in group II (p less than 0. 005).

On the contrary, <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>chloride</b> in group V prevented the occurrence of barium-induced ventricular arrhythmias (p less than 0. 005 vs group III and IV). Thus, flecainide acetate is able to reduce reperfusion-induced ventricular arrhythmias, but is unable to reduce barium-induced ventricular arrhythmias, presumably because of a different mechanism of these two types of arrhythmia...|$|E

Functional {{recovery of the}} endothelium was examined in vivo during reperfusion after 15 minutes of ischemia. Vasodilatory responses to acetylcholine were severely impaired during the first hour of reperfusion but gradually improved over a 90 -minute period after ischemia. The vasocon-strictive response to U 46619 was enhanced for the first 30 minutes of reperfusion and returned to normal within 60 minutes.

In the present study, we evaluated the effect of a Boswellia serrata gum resin extract (BSE) on intestinal motility and diarrhoea in rodents. BSE depressed electrically-, acetylcholine-, and barium chloride-induced contractions in the isolated guinea-pig ileum, being more potent in inhibiting the contractions induced by <b>acetylcholine</b> and barium <b>chloride.</b> The inhibitory effect of BSE on acetylcholine-induced contractions was reduced by the L-type Ca 2 + channel blockers verapamil and nifedipine, but not by the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 +-ATPase inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid, by the phosphodiesterase type IV inhibitor rolipram or by the lipoxygenase inhibitor zileuton. 3 -acetyl- 11 -keto-β-boswellic acid, one of the main active ingredients of B. serrata, inhibited acetylcholine-induced contractions. BSE inhibited upper gastrointestinal transit in croton oil-treated mice as well as castor oil-induced diarrhoea. However, BSE did not affect intestinal motility in control mice, both in the small and in the large intestine. It is concluded that BSE directly inhibits intestinal motility with a mechanism involving L-type Ca 2 + channels. BSE prevents diarrhoea and normalizes intestinal motility in pathophysiological states without slowing the rate of transit in control animals. These results could explain, at least in part, the clinical efficacy of this Ayurvedic remedy in reducing diarrhoea in patients with inflammatory bowel disease...|$|R

[...] The contractile responses to intra-arterial injections of <b>acetylcholine,</b> carbachol, potassium <b>chloride,</b> caffeine and neostigmine were examined in innervated and denervated in vivo extensor digitorum communis (EDC) muscle preparations from normal and dystrophic chickens. In addition, the electrophysiologic properties of this preparation were characterized in normal and dystrophic muscles. The pharmacologic responses to serotonin and noradrenalin were assessed in vitro ischiatic artery preparations of the chicken. [...] Sensitivity to acetylcholine was reduced in dystrophic muscle, although this appears to be associated with enhanced hydrolysis of acetylcholine in dystrophic muscle. The development of extrajunctional acetylcholine sensitivity in denervated dystrophic muscle was also reduced when compared to normal muscle. Denervated dystrophic muscle did not exhibit denervation atrophy. In the disease group, the duration of the intracellular action potential was increased. The results also suggested that the dystrophic ischiatic artery was less sensitive to serotonin than was normal muscle. [...] This study supports the hypothesis that the functional state of the dystrophic muscle membrane is altered in the muscular dystrophies. The defect may also be present in the vascular smooth muscle of dystrophic chickens.

40|$|We present {{here the}} first {{laboratory}} {{study on the}} effects of pharmacologically active compounds on the larval metamorphosis of the New Zealand geoduck, Panopea zelandica (Quoy and Gaimard, 1835). Two batches of competent hatchery-reared larvae were exposed to <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>chloride,</b> epinephrine hydrochloride and excess potassium ions in the form of KCl and K 2 SO 4. None of the tested chemicals increased the proportion of metamorphosed geoducks, and in some cases, the chemical caused significant mortality, despite having been used extensively with other species, such as mussels and oysters. This might indicate that geoduck larval physiology and development differs from other bivalves. Geoducks may have evolved distinct chemoreceptor patterns that facilitate metamorphosis under environmentally favourable conditions for subtidal soft sediment habitats suitable for burrowing. Thus, {{further research is needed to}} identify alternative cues (e. g. conspecific adults, sediment characteristics and surface biofilm) and understand their role in settlement and metamorphosis. This information will aid the design of reseeding methods and contribute to the development of reliable hatchery production of geoduck spat...|$|E
40|$|Although {{numerous}} {{studies have been conducted}} {{to examine the effects of}} neuroactive compounds on bivalve larvae, few have identified chemicals capable of inducing settlement behavior in the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica. In this study, I treated competent C. virginica larvae with select chemicals to identify those which are capable of inducing settlement behavior at an average salinity of 9. 6 (± 0. 1). The compounds γ-aminobutyric acid and <b>acetylcholine</b> <b>chloride,</b> both at 10 - 4 M, did not significantly increase the percentage of larvae exhibiting settlement behavior. As compared with the control, a significant increase in settlement behavior was induced by treatment with 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine, 5 -hydroxytryptamine, and L- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine all at 10 - 4 M, as well as ammonia as a solution of 7. 9 mM NH 4 Cl (pH= 8. 0). These findings differ somewhat from the results of similar studies involving other species in the Crassostrea genus and may be of value to hatchery personnel or researchers interested in the chemical induction of settlement behavior in the eastern oyster...|$|E
40|$|The {{isolated}} {{vas deferens}} of the guinea-pig contracted when stimulated transmurally with parallel wire electrodes. These contractions persisted in concentrations of hexamethonium, pentolinium, nicotine and mecamylamine {{which at the}} same time abolished the responses to hypogastric nerve stimulation. Procaine and lignocaine in local anaesthetic concentrations abolished the responses to transmural stimulation but potentiated the contractions produced by added noradrenaline. Guanethidine and bretylium in concentrations specific for adrenergic neurone blockade abolished the contractions due to transmural stimulation without impairing the responses of the muscle to added noradrenaline or acetylcholine. In contrast, high concentrations of the adrenergic-blocking agents phentolamine and dihydroergotamine were needed to block the contractions due to transmural stimulation; these concentrations also blocked the response to added noradrenaline but simultaneously reduced the responses to added <b>acetylcholine</b> or potassium <b>chloride.</b> Preparations from guinea-pigs previously treated with reserpine at first responded normally to transmural stimulation; thereafter the contractions diminished progressively but were never abolished. Hyoscine and atropine produced a small decrease in the response to transmural stimulation when present in concentrations up to 1 × 10 - 5 and a larger decrease only in concentrations of 1 × 10 - 4 or greater. Hemicholinium produced a small decrease of the contractions due to transmural stimulation in concentrations up to 1 × 10 - 4; concentrations of 5 × 10 - 4 present for 1 hr produced only a slightly greater reduction in response. These experiments show that when the guinea-pig vas deferens is removed without the hypogastric nerve and stimulated transmurally by the method described, contractions are produced mainly by excitation of postganglionic adrenergic nerves...|$|R
40|$|In trachealis bathed by a K+-rich, Ca 2 +-free {{physiological}} salt solution, {{calcium chloride}} (CaCl 2) at 0. 01 to 10 mmol l- 1 evoked concentration-dependent spasm. Verapamil (0. 1 to 10 mumol l- 1) was an effective antagonist of CaCl 2. Spasm evoked by <b>acetylcholine,</b> histamine, potassium <b>chloride</b> (KCl) and tetraethylammonium (TEA) was studied in trachealis bathed by normal Krebs solution. Verapamil (0. 1 to 10 mumol l- 1) markedly suppressed spasm evoked by KCl and TEA. In contrast {{the actions of}} acetylcholine and histamine were much less affected by verapamil. Spasm evoked by prostaglandin E 2 was studied in trachealis bathed by Krebs solution containing indomethacin (2. 8 mumol l- 1). Verapamil (0. 1 to 10 mumol l- 1) {{had little or no}} effect against prostaglandin E 2 -induced spasm. Verapamil (0. 1 to 10 mumol l- 1) had relatively little effect on the tone of trachealis bathed by normal Krebs solution. In contrast bathing in Krebs solution lacking CaCl 2 caused almost complete tone loss. Extracellular electrophysiological recording showed that verapamil (10 mumol l- 1) suppressed not only TEA-evoked spasm but also TEA-evoked slow waves and spike potentials. Verapamil also abolished the transient period of slow wave activity associated with the spasm evoked by KCl. Intracellular electrophysiological recording showed that TEA-induced spike activity was resistant to tetrodotoxin (3 mumol l- 1). However, verapamil (10 mumol l- 1) abolished the tetrodotoxin-resistant spikes without increasing the resting membrane potential. It is concluded that verapamil suppresses TEA- or KCl-induced spasm, slow waves or spikes by inhibition of Ca 2 + influx. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cholera toxin (CT) acts on {{intestinal}} {{epithelial cells}} both {{directly and indirectly}} via activation of a secretory neural reflex. The reflex may release acetylcholine {{as one of its}} final neurotransmitters. This opens up the possibility of a third mechanism of action for CT, namely a synergistic interaction between two secretagogues acting on different second messenger systems within the epithelial cell. Aims: To establish evidence for cholinergic innervation to human ileal epithelial cells and to investigate whether CT potentiates the action of acetylcholine on human intestinal epithelial cells. Methods: Transverse sections of human ileum were examined for mucosal cholinergic nerves and M 3 muscarinic receptors using antibodies raised to choline acetyltransferase and M 3 receptors. Short circuit current (Isc) responses and ion flux movements were elicited from T 84 epithelial cell monolayers set up in Ussing chambers. Results: Immunohistochemistry of native human ileal mucosa revealed the presence of both cholinergic nerves and muscarinic M 3 receptors located to the basolateral domain of epithelial cells. Secretory responses of T 84 cell monolayers to acetylcholine were greatly potentiated in the presence of CT. This effect, substituting forskolin for CT, was mirrored by increases in basolateral 86 Rb and apical 125 I efflux. Charybdotoxin plus apamin reduced both Isc and 86 Rb efflux evoked by acetylcholine, in the presence of forskolin. Conclusions: Human ileal mucosa receives a direct cholinergic innervation to its epithelial cells. Secretory effects of acetylcholine on epithelial cells are augmented in the presence of CT. Such a synergistic response is dependent on optimum opening of basolateral potassium channels by <b>acetylcholine</b> and apical <b>chloride</b> channels by CT. The interaction may contribute to the mechanism of action of cholera toxin induced secretory diarrhoea.
