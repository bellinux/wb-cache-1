25|$|The program's ratings climbed slowly, but {{steadily}} {{throughout the}} 1970s {{and into the}} 1980s while Today experienced a slight slump in viewership, especially with Walters' decision to leave NBC for a job <b>at</b> <b>ABC</b> <b>News.</b> On August 30, 1976, Tom Brokaw began anchoring Today while the program began {{a search for a}} female co-host.
