25|$|The use of {{bulletproof}} glass has shielded the Mona Lisa {{from more}} recent attacks. In April 1974, a handicapped woman, {{upset by the}} museum's policy for the disabled, sprayed red paint <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> while it was {{on display at the}} Tokyo National Museum. On 2 August 2009, a Russian woman, distraught over being denied French citizenship, threw a terracotta mug or teacup, purchased at the museum, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> in the Louvre; the vessel shattered against the glass enclosure. In both cases, the painting was undamaged.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, {{part of the}} {{painting}} was damaged when a vandal threw acid at it. On 30 December of that year, a rock was thrown <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> dislodging a speck of pigment near the left elbow, later restored.|$|E
25|$|In 1761, {{the monk}} Hilarion {{published}} a book enumerating 17 miracles attributed to the painting and the Virgin Mary. The first miracle he recorded occurred in 1671, the same year the first chapel was built. A two-year-old child fell from the second floor onto a stone pavement and was badly injured. The parents then prayed to Our Lady {{and the next day}} the child was healthy once again. In 1702, Vilnius was captured by the Swedish Army during the Great Northern War. The Swedes, who were Protestants, mocked the painting, forbade songs and prayers, and caroused around the Gate of Dawn. One soldier even shot <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> (the bullet hole can still be seen on the right sleeve). In the early morning of Great and Holy Saturday, the heavy iron gates fell and crushed four Swedish soldiers – two died instantly and two later from their injuries. The next day, Easter Sunday, the Lithuanian Army successfully counter-attacked near the gate. The commander, grateful for the victory, bestowed a large silver votive offering upon the chapel. The painting is also credited with other miracles: subduing a city fire in 1706, punishing a Russian soldier for an attempt to steal her silver clothes in 1708, and numerous miraculous healings. Other stories of various miracles were kept by the Carmelite monks, but those books have not survived.|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers and {{visitors}} {{agreed with the}} Boston Daily Advertiser that [...] "it is impossible to tell where reality ends and the painting begins."

500|$|According to Steve Turner, one of Van Morrison's biographers, Irish painter Cecil McCartney {{influenced}} the titling of Astral Weeks. [...] Morrison related how [...] "A {{friend of mine}} had drawings in his flat of astral projection. I was at his house when I {{was working on a}} song which began, 'If I venture down the slipstream' and that's why I called it 'Astral Weeks'." [...] "It was a painting," [...] McCartney corrects. [...] "There were several paintings in the studio at the time. Van looked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> and it suggested astral travelling to him." [...] The album cover photograph of Van Morrison was taken by Joel Brodsky, best known for his [...] "Young Lions" [...] photoshoot with [...] Jim Morrison. The squared circle in the cover photo is described as portraying [...] "the mystic symbol of the union of opposites; the sacred marriage of heaven and earth".|$|E

He gave up on the idea of going aft and jumped into the water to get away from the crowd. Others made no attempt to escape. The ship's designer, Thomas Andrews, was reportedly last seen in the first-class smoking room, having removed his lifebelt, staring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> above the fireplace. Captain Smith's fate is unclear as there are conflicting accounts of his death; he either entered the wheelhouse on the bridge and died there when it was engulfed or jumped into the water just before the bridge was submerged and subsequently perished in the water, possibly near Collapsible B.|$|E

2500|$|In Metzinger's theory, {{the artist}} and the object being {{observed}} became equivocally linked so {{that the results of}} any observation seemed to be determined, at least partially, by actual choices made by the artist. [...] "An object has not one absolute form; it has many," [...] Metzinger wrote. Furthermore, part of the role of placing together various images was left to the observer (the one looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting).</b> The object represented, depending on how the observer perceives it, could have as many forms [...] "as there are planes in the region of perception."

2500|$|... "Master of Stillness" [...] {{records the}} {{creation}} of [...] "Labyrinth" [...] (2011), Smart's final work before retiring aged 91. Critic John McDonald calls it [...] "a farewell picture – a last definitive statement that rules a line under a long and distinguished career". Curator, author and critic Barry Pearce, interviewed in the film, says of [...] "Labyrinth": [...] "It {{is a kind of}} arrival <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> he was always chasing, never satisfied, hoping the next one on the easel would be the elusive masterpiece, the one that said it all." [...] Hunter visited Smart at his farmhouse in Tuscany and the painter took her to some of the places near Arezzo that have long inspired him – the concrete streetscapes and urban wastelands that define his vision. [...] "If a good painting comes off, it has a stillness, it has a perfection, and that's as great as anything that I think a musician or a poet can do", said Smart.|$|E
2500|$|Within {{the context}} of Cubism, artists were forced into the {{position}} of re-evaluating {{the role of the}} observer. Classical linear and aerial perspective, uninterrupted surface transitions and chiaroscuro were pushed aside. What remained was a series of images obtained by the observer (the artist) in different frames of reference as the object was being painted. Essentially, observations became linked through a system of coordinate transformations. The result was Metzinger's 'total image' or a combination of successive images. In Metzinger's theory, the artist and the object being observed became equivocally linked so that the results of any observation seemed to be determined, at least partially, by actual choices made by the artist. [...] "An object has not one absolute form; it has many," [...] Metzinger wrote.

2500|$|Traditions {{have also}} {{connected}} Maudgalyāyana with {{the symbol of}} the Wheel of Becoming ( [...] , [...] ). Accounts in the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya and the Divyāvadāna relate that Ānanda once told the Buddha about Maudgalyāyana's good qualities as a teacher. Maudgalyayana was a very popular teacher, and his sermons with regard to afterlife destinations were very popular. The Buddha said that in the future, a person like him would be hard to find. The Buddha then had an image painted on the gate of the Veluvaḷa monastery to honor Maudgalyāyana, depicting the Wheel of Becoming. This wheel showed the different realms of the cycle of existence, the three poisons in the mind (greed, hatred and delusion), and the teaching of dependent origination. The wheel was depicted as being in the clutches of Māra, {{but at the same time}} included the symbol of a white circle for Nirvana. The Buddha further decreed that a monk be stationed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> to explain the law of karma to visitors. Images of the Wheel of Becoming are widespread in Buddhist Asia, some of which confirm and depict the original connection with Maudgalyāyana.|$|E
2500|$|Masterpiece is {{regarded}} as a tongue in cheek joke that reflects upon Lichtenstein's own career. In retrospect, the joke is considered [...] "witty and yet eerily prescient" [...] because it portended some of the future turmoil that the artist would endure. In the painting, [...] the blonde female's speech bubble, [...] "Why, Brad darling, This painting is a masterpiece! My, soon you'll have all of New York clamoring for your work!" [...] conveys her remark as she gazes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting,</b> of which a corner of the back is shown. Silent Brad conveys his agreement by his facial expression. Adrian Searle of The Guardian says that the 1962 work, whose narrative and graphical content were both borrowed, was timely because Lichtenstein had his first exhibition in New York City at Leo Castelli Gallery that year, making the painting aspirational in an ironic way that comments on success and [...] "the socio-sexual status of the hot young artist". The satirical commentary on Lichtenstein's career, followed the inside joke made the year before in Mr. Bellamy. According to Roberta Smith of The New York Times, Masterpiece was one of Lichtenstein's works created in a way that produced [...] "faint and uneven" [...] Ben Day dots.|$|E

60|$|But {{the action}} {{produced}} an effect altogether unanticipated. The {{rays of the}} numerous candles (for there were many) now fell within a niche of the room which had hitherto been thrown into deep shade {{by one of the}} bed-posts. I thus saw in vivid light a picture all unnoticed before. It was the portrait of a young girl just ripening into womanhood. I glanced <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> hurriedly, and then closed my eyes. Why I did this was not at first apparent even to my own perception. But while my lids remained thus shut, I ran over in my mind my reason for so shutting them. It was an impulsive movement to gain time for thought--to make sure that my vision had not deceived me--to calm and subdue my fancy for a more sober and more certain gaze. In a very few moments I again looked fixedly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting.</b>|$|E

60|$|To {{these two}} ideals of Kinghood, then, {{the boy has}} reached, {{since the day he}} was drawing the lamb on the stone, as Cimabue passed by. You will not find two other such, that I know of, in the west of Europe; and yet there has been many a try <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> of crowned heads,--and King George III and Queen Charlotte, by Sir Joshua Reynolds, are very fine, no doubt.

60|$|How {{was this}} vile nervous fit, for such I now persuaded myself it was, to be conquered?

I began to undress, {{but in spite of}} every effort I could not keep myself from stealing a glance every now and then at the picture; and a glance was now sufficient to distress me. Even when my back was turned to it, the idea of this strange face behind me, peering over my shoulder, was insufferable. I threw off my clothes and hurried into bed; but still this visage gazed upon me. I had a full view of it from my bed, and for some time could not take my eyes from it. I had grown nervous to a dismal degree.|$|E

The moment I touched it I went wild. I tore it into little pieces and threw them on the floor. A workman was repainting the pillars inside the patio. A bucket of his paint happened to be convenient. I picked up his brush and slapped a quart of blue paint all over that ten-thousand-dollar nightmare. I bowed, and walked out. The president didn't move or speak. That was one time he was taken by surprise. It's tough on you, Billy, but I couldn't help it." ...|$|E
