5|$|HIV is {{now known}} to spread between CD4+ T cells by two {{parallel}} routes: cell-free spread and cell-to-cell spread, i.e. it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms. In the cell-free spread, virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter. HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread. Two pathways of cell-to-cell transmission have been reported. Firstly, an infected T cell can transmit virus directly to a target T cell via a virological synapse. Secondly, an <b>antigen</b> <b>presenting</b> <b>cell</b> (APC) can also transmit HIV to T cells by a process that either involves productive infection (in the case of macrophages) or capture and transfer of virions in trans (in the case of dendritic cells). Whichever pathway is used, infection by cell-to-cell transfer {{is reported to be}} much more efficient than cell-free virus spread. A number of factors contribute to this increased efficiency, including polarised virus budding towards the site of cell-to-cell contact, close apposition of cells which minimizes fluid-phase diffusion of virions, and clustering of HIV entry receptors on the target cell to the contact zone. Cell-to-cell spread is thought to be particularly important in lymphoid tissues where CD4+ T lymphocytes are densely packed and likely to frequently interact. Intravital imaging studies have supported the concept of the HIV virological synapse in vivo. The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus's ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{release of}} nuclear {{proteins}} and chromatin, antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, display these antigens to T helper cells. Although {{the details of}} this process are still controversial, evidence shows that to produce an immune response, DNA must activate an <b>antigen</b> <b>presenting</b> <b>cell</b> to produce type 1 interferons. This cytokine serves to induce maturation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) so that they can display their antigens to T helper cells. The mechanism in which eukaryotic DNA activates these cells is still as yet unclear; however, immunogenic CpG sequences have been found to either activate PDCs or act as adjuvant in the response to eukaryotic DNA. CpG motif DNA acts via the pattern recognition receptor, toll-like receptor 9, found highly expressed in PDCs and B cells. The T helper cells then activate B cells, which are also in the presence of these antigens, causing the production of autoantibodies.|$|E

500|$|Complete {{stimulation}} of T helper cells requires the B7 molecule {{present on the}} <b>antigen</b> <b>presenting</b> <b>cell</b> to bind with CD28 molecule present on the T cell surface (in close proximity with the T cell receptor). Likewise, a second interaction between the CD40 ligand or CD154 (CD40L) present on T cell surface and CD40 present on B cell surface, is also necessary. The same interactions that stimulate the T helper cell also stimulate the B cell, hence the term costimulation. The entire mechanism ensures that an activated T cell only stimulates a B cell that recognizes the antigen containing the same epitope as recognized by the T cell receptor of the [...] "costimulating" [...] T helper cell. The B cell gets stimulated, apart from the direct costimulation, by certain growth factors, viz., interleukins 2, 4, 5, and 6 in a paracrine fashion. These factors are usually produced by the newly activated T helper cell. However, this activation occurs only after the B cell receptor present on a memory or a naive B cell itself would have bound to the corresponding epitope, without which the initiating steps of phagocytosis and antigen processing would not have occurred.|$|E

[...] Historically, memory T cells were thought to belong to either the effector or central memory subtypes, each with their own distinguishing set of cell surface markers (see below). Subsequently, numerous new populations of memory T cells were discovered including tissue-resident memory T (Trm) cells, stem memory TSCM cells, and virtual memory T cells. [...] The single unifying theme for all memory T cell subtypes is that they are long-lived and can quickly expand to large numbers of effector T cells upon re-exposure to their cognate antigen. By this mechanism they provide the immune system with [...] "memory" [...] against previously encountered pathogens. Memory T cells may be either CD4+ or CD8+ and usually express CD45RO.|$|E

50|$|Abatacept is {{a fusion}} protein {{composed}} of the Fc region of the immunoglobulin IgG1 fused to the extracellular domain of CTLA-4.

Dendritic cells, {{a type of}} <b>antigen</b> <b>presenting</b> <b>cell,</b> are harvested from the person needing the immunotherapy. These cells are then either pulsed with an antigen or tumor lysate or transfected with a viral vector, causing them to display the antigen. Upon transfusion into the person, these activated cells present the antigen to the effector lymphocytes (CD4+ helper T cells, cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and B cells). This initiates a cytotoxic response against tumor cells expressing the antigen (against which the adaptive response has now been primed).

50|$|Artificial <b>antigen</b> <b>presenting</b> <b>cells</b> (aAPCs) {{are a new}} {{technology}} and approach to cancer immunotherapy. Immunotherapy aims to utilize the body’s own defense mechanism—the immune system—to recognize mutated cancer cells and to kill them the way the immune system would recognize and kill a virus. <b>Antigen</b> <b>presenting</b> <b>cells</b> are the sentinels {{of the immune system}} and patrol the body for pathogens. When they encounter foreign pathogens, the <b>antigen</b> <b>presenting</b> <b>cells</b> alert the T cells—“the soldiers of the immune system”—that there is something foreign in the body with specific cell surface molecules. aAPCs are synthetic versions of these sentinel cells and are made by attaching the specific T-cell stimulating signals to various macro and micro biocompatible surfaces. This can potentially reduce the cost while allowing control over generating large numbers of functional pathogen-specific T cells for therapy. Activated and stimulated T cells can be studied in this biomimetic contex and used for adoptive transfer as an immunotherapy.|$|R

50|$|HLA-DM is {{a protein}} {{involved}} in the immune system. It is a molecular chaperone that works in lysosomes and endosomes.

50|$|After {{leaving the}} bone marrow, the B cell {{acts as an}} <b>antigen</b> <b>presenting</b> <b>cell</b> (APC) and internalizes {{offending}} antigens, which are {{taken up by the}} B cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis and processed. Pieces of the antigen (which are now known as antigenic peptides) are loaded onto MHC II molecules, and presented on its extracellular surface to CD4+ T cells (sometimes called T helper cells). These T cells bind to the MHC II-antigen molecule and cause activation of the B cell. This is a type of safeguard to the system, almost like a two-factor authentication method. First, the B cells have to encounter a foreign antigen, and are then required to be activated by T helper cells before they differentiate to specific cells.|$|E
50|$|Thus when an antigen is {{properly}} {{presented to the}} T lymphocytes by an <b>antigen</b> <b>presenting</b> <b>cell</b> (APC), which displays the antigen on its MHC II complex and which activates T cell´s costimulatory receptors, T lymphocytes undergo productive response. However, when T cells interacts with an antigen not presented by the APCs, that is very probably not the antigen that an immune response should be held against, the T cell undergoes anergy. It {{has also been shown}} that certain antigens properly presented by the APCs induce the T cell activation only weakly. This weak stimuli still activates NFAT sufficiently, however AP-1 is not, thereby the anergistic response takes place even with the costimulation.Strong stimulation of T-cells either by IL-2 or by TCR/costimulatory receptors can break the anergy.|$|E
