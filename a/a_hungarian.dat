5|$|<b>A</b> <b>Hungarian</b> army {{under the}} command of Ispán Denis stormed into Sirmium once more in spring 1166. The Hungarians routed a Byzantine army, and {{occupied}} the whole province with the exception of Zimony. Emperor Manuel sent three armies against Hungary. The first army, which was {{under the command}} of protostrator Alexios Axuch and Stephen III's brother, Béla, was stationed by the Danube to distract attention from the movements of the two other units, which plundered Transylvania {{under the command of}} Leon Batatzes and John Doukas. The Byzantine campaign caused great devastation in the eastern territories of the Kingdom of Hungary, forcing Stephen III to seek reconciliation. Upon his request, Henry Jasomirgott, Duke of Austria, whose wife was Emperor Manuel's niece, mediated an armistice. At the end of the year, Stephen married the Duke's daughter Agnes. Around the same time, <b>a</b> <b>Hungarian</b> army invaded Dalmatia and captured Nikephoros Chalouphes, the Byzantine governor of the province.
