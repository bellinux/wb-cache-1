5|$|Cecil B. DeMille {{released}} This Day <b>and</b> <b>Age</b> in 1933, and {{it stands}} {{in stark contrast}} to his other films of the period. Filmed shortly after DeMille had completed a five-month tour of the Soviet Union, This Day <b>and</b> <b>Age</b> takes place in America and features several children torturing a gangster who got away with the murder of a popular local shopkeeper. The youngsters are seen lowering the gangster into a vat of rats when the police arrive, and their response is to encourage the youths to continue this. The film ends with the youngsters taking the gangster to a local judge and forcing the magistrate to conduct a trial in which the outcome is never in doubt.|$|E

5|$|In {{most current}} cultures, {{it is more}} typical for women to wear long hair than for men to do so. An American study shows {{significant}} correlation between hair length <b>and</b> <b>age,</b> which indicates that younger women tend to have longer hair than older women. A significant correlation was also found between women's hair length and hair quality. Moreover, hair quality was correlated with the women's perceived physical health. Consistent with principles of evolutionary psychology, {{these results indicate that}} hair length and quality can act as a cue to a woman's youth and health, signifying reproductive potential. The correlation between the woman's hair length and marital status, or number of children, was however not more than to be expected from the correlation between hair length <b>and</b> <b>age.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} {{has affected}} men, women, {{and children in}} Malawi, certain factors such as sexual orientation, gender, <b>and</b> <b>age</b> influence infection patterns. In Malawi, HIV/AIDS is usually transmitted through heterosexual sex, but the epidemic has also significantly impacted the homosexual male population in Malawi. In addition, women in Malawi {{are more likely to}} be HIV-positive than men, suggesting that women are particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Finally, the disease has affected children and young adults both directly and indirectly; 170,000 Malawian children were HIV-positive in 2011, and the number of orphans in Malawi has increased dramatically since the epidemic began in 1985.|$|E

This study aimed to compare and test the relationship between knowledge <b>and</b> perspective toward <b>aged</b> condition <b>and</b> <b>aging</b> among medical <b>and</b> biotechnology students. This study was a comparative analytical and correlative study with a cross-sectional method {{in the period of}} January to May 2013 conducted at the School of Biotechnology and the School of Medicine Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia. Knowledge towards <b>aged</b> condition <b>and</b> <b>aging</b> was measured using the Facts about Aging Quiz 1 (FAQ 1). Perspective towards <b>aged</b> condition <b>and</b> <b>aging</b> was measured using the Anxiety about <b>Aging</b> Scale (AAS) <b>and</b> the <b>Aging</b> Semantic Differential (ASD). There were 45 students from each school [...] Knowledge about <b>aged</b> condition <b>and</b> <b>aging</b> of the medical and biotechnology students was quite low. There were no significant differences (p= 0. 199) between the two groups. The AAS data showed that respondents did not have any fear of old people. They were also not really concern about physiological and physical appearances and were not afraid of lost. The ASD data showed that they tended to have positive views: the elderly people are useful, independent, and able to accept their condition. The correlation tests between FAQ 1 -AAS and FAQ 1 -ASD showed no correlation.

5|$|In early 1922, the world's major navies, {{including}} Italy, {{signed the}} Washington Naval Treaty.

They could not, however, be replaced by new battleships under the normal practice of the Treaty system, which provided for replacements after a ship was 20 years old. Napoli was retained for a few years, but was stricken from the naval register on 3 August 1926 and sold for scrap.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{attitude}} of present middle-age generation to senior <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>aging.</b> The work {{is focused on the}} attitude character, i. e. whether it is positive, neutral or negative.

The main aim of {{the first part of the}} work was to map the views and approaches to senior <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>aging</b> occurring in the society. The second part is a research one and includes data analysis, and quantitative research among respondents in the issues of the approach to senior <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>aging.</b> The main aim of the second part of the work was to find the current view of the present middle-age generation to senior <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>aging.</b> The quantitative research was performed by the method of questioning by means of the standardized questionnaire technique examining the view of senior <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>aging.</b> The research shows that the middle-age generation views the senior <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>aging</b> positively. It also shows that the differences in the views of senior <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>aging</b> between the monitored middle-generation groups are not remarkable. In the discussion the author compares the results of her work with the views of other authors dealing with the same issue. She points out the areas of problems that occurred during the research. This thesis is contributory because it describes the character of the attitude of present middle-age society to the senior <b>age</b> <b>and</b> <b>aging.</b> The results may be beneficial for student involved in caring for people of this age group in their practical training and other activities.
