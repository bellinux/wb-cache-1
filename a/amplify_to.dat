50|$|Most popular musical {{ensembles}} {{include an}} instrument capable of playing bass notes. In the 1890s, a tuba was often used. From the 1920s to the 1940s, most popular music groups used the double bass as the bass instrument. Starting in the 1950s, the bass guitar began {{to replace the}} double bass in most types of popular music, such as rock and roll, blues, and folk. The bass guitar was easier to transport and, given that it uses magnetic pickups, easier to <b>amplify</b> <b>to</b> loud stage volumes without the risk of audio feedback, a common problem with the amplified double bass. By the 1970s and 1980s, the electric bass was used in most rock bands and jazz fusion groups. The double bass was still used in some types of popular music that recreated styles from the 1940s and 1950s such as jazz (especially swing and bebop), traditional 1950s blues, jump blues, country, and rockabilly.|$|E
5000|$|Receivers {{usually have}} several stages of amplification: the radio {{signal from the}} {{bandpass}} filter is <b>amplified</b> <b>to</b> make it powerful enough to drive the demodulator, then the audio signal from the demodulator is <b>amplified</b> <b>to</b> make it powerful enough to operate the speaker. The degree of amplification of a radio receiver is measured by a parameter called its sensitivity, which is the minimum signal strength of a station at the antenna, measured in microvolts, necessary to receive the signal clearly, with a certain signal-to-noise ratio. Since it is easy <b>to</b> <b>amplify</b> a signal <b>to</b> any desired degree, the limit to the sensitivity of many modern receivers is not the degree of amplification but random electronic noise present in the circuit, which can drown out a weak radio signal.|$|R

50|$|The {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} method is used to quantify nucleic acids by amplifying a nucleic acid molecule with the enzyme DNA polymerase. Conventional PCR {{is based on the}} theory that amplification is exponential. Therefore, nucleic acids may be quantified by comparing the number of amplification cycles and amount of PCR end-product to those of a reference sample. However, many factors complicate this calculation, creating uncertainties and inaccuracies. These factors include the following: initial amplification cycles may not be exponential; PCR amplification eventually plateaus after an uncertain number of cycles; and low initial concentrations of target nucleic acid molecules may not <b>amplify</b> <b>to</b> detectable levels. However, the most significant limitation of PCR is that PCR amplification efficiency in a sample of interest may be different from that of reference samples. Since PCR is an exponential process, only twofold differences in amplification can be observed, greatly impacting the validity and precision of the results.|$|E

5000|$|One of the {{challenges}} when distributing (and consuming) video on Twitter is that many consumers have fast feeds. Twitter Amplify {{makes it possible to}} pin the social video tweet to the visible part of the feed so the user is more likely to see it and engage with it. Moreover, if a broadcaster sends a tweet from its own Twitter account, it can target only the people that are following that account (i.e. its [...] "organic reach"). However, when a sponsor runs a paid campaign with Twitter Amplify, it can also target anyone tweeting about that topic or content at that time, or any other user who may be interested in the content (because they have followed a relevant account, tweeted against a particular hashtag or discussed an associated topic in their feed) - rather than being restricted to its own Twitter followers. Broadcasters and rights holders can therefore ensure their video tweets are seen and use paid media distribution (Twitter <b>Amplify)</b> <b>to</b> extend this reach to a much wider and relevant demographic. This audience can be many times the size of their existing, organic reach - potentially the entire audience of Twitter.|$|E
5000|$|Acoustic sounds (such as voices or musical instruments) {{are often}} {{recorded}} with transducers (microphones and pickups) that produce weak electrical signals. These signals must be <b>amplified</b> <b>to</b> line level, {{where they are}} more easily manipulated by other devices such as mixing consoles and tape recorders. Such amplification is performed by a device known as a preamplifier or [...] "preamp", which boosts the signal to line level. After manipulation at line level, signals are then typically sent to a power amplifier, where they are <b>amplified</b> <b>to</b> levels that can drive headphones or loudspeakers. These convert the signals back into sounds that can be heard through the air.|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{revisit the}} problem of {{hardness}} amplification in N P, as recently studied by O'Donnell(JCSS ` 04). We prove that if N P has a balanced function f such that any circuit of size s(n) fails to compute f on a 1 / poly(n) fraction of inputs, then N P has a function f 0 such that anycircuit of size s 0 (n) = s(pn) Ω (1) fails to compute f 0 on a 1 / 2 - 1 /s 0 (n) fraction of inputs. Inparticular, 1. If s(n) = n!(1), we <b>amplify</b> <b>to</b> hardness 1 / 2 - 1 /n!(1). 2. If s(n) = 2 n Ω (1), we <b>amplify</b> <b>to</b> hardness 1 / 2 - 1 / 2 nΩ (1). 3.

40|$|We {{revisit the}} problem of {{hardness}} amplification in N P, as recently studied by O’Donnell (STOC ‘ 02). We prove that if N P has a balanced function f such that any circuit of size s(n) fails to compute f on a 1 / poly(n) fraction of inputs, then N P has a function f ′ such that any circuit of size s ′ (n) = s (√ n) Ω(1) fails to compute f ′ on a 1 / 2 − 1 /s ′ (n) fraction of inputs. In particular, 1. If s(n) = n ω(1), we <b>amplify</b> <b>to</b> hardness 1 / 2 − 1 /n ω(1). 2. If s(n) = 2 nΩ(1), we <b>amplify</b> <b>to</b> hardness 1 / 2 − 1 / 2 nΩ(1) 3.

O’Donnell also proved that no construction of a certain general form could amplify beyond 1 / 2 − 1 /n. We bypass this barrier by using both derandomization and nondeterminism {{in the construction of}} f ′.

30|$|The {{existence}} of a solution for an inverse problem is, in most cases, secured by defining the data space to be the set of solutions to the direct problem. This approach may fail if the data is incomplete, perturbed or noisy. Problems involving differential operators, for example, are notoriously ill-posed, because the differentiation operator is not continuous with respect to any physically meaningful observation topology. If the uniqueness of a solution cannot de secured from the given data, additional data and/or a priori knowledge about the solution need {{to be used to}} further restrict the set of admissible solutions. Of the three Hadamard requirements, stability is the most difficult to ensure and verify. If an inverse problem fails to be stable, then small round-off errors or noise in the data will <b>amplify</b> <b>to</b> a degree that renders a computed solution useless.|$|E
40|$|Highly {{polymorphic}} microsatellite markers {{are widely}} em-ployed in population genetic analyses (eg, of biological parentage and mating systems), but one potential drawback {{is the presence}} of null alleles that fail to <b>amplify</b> <b>to</b> detected levels in the PCR assays. Here we examine 233 published articles in which authors reported the suspected presence of one or more microsatellite null alleles, and we review how these purported nulls were detected and handled in the data analyses. We also employ computer simulations and analytical treatments to determine how microsatellite null alleles might impact molecular parentage analyses. The results indicate that whereas null alleles in frequencies typically reported in the literature introduce rather incon-sequential biases on average exclusion probabilities, they can introduce substantial errors into empirical assessments of specific mating events by leading to high frequencies of false parentage exclusions...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the necessary and sufficient conditions {{in order that}} a unitary operator can amplify a pre-assigned component relative to a particular basis of a generic vector at the expence of the other components. This leads to a general method which allows, given a vector {{and one of its}} components we want to <b>amplify,</b> <b>to</b> choose the optimal unitary operator which realizes that goal. Grover’s quantum algorithm is shown to be a particular case of our general method. However the general structure of the unitary we find is remarkably similar to that of Grover’s one: a sign flip of one component combined with a reflection with respect to a vector. In Grover’s case this vector is fixed; in our case it depends on a parameter and this allows optimization. 1 Unitary operators which increase the probability of the | 0 > component of a pre-assigned vecto...|$|E
