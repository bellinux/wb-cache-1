25|$|However, some {{observers}} claim the merger {{has not had}} positive results. Critics argue that local FEA unions are less effective in collective bargaining, local and state <b>annual</b> <b>dues</b> are too high, young teachers are reluctant to join their local affiliates, and neither the state association nor local unions have done much to protect under-performing teachers from being fired. These critics say the association is increasingly frozen out of politics {{in a state where}} Republicans control both the executive and legislative branches of government, and has made little headway in convincing the public that the candidates it backs are worth electing or the policies it supports are worth enacting. FEA supporters counter that the federation has proven effective despite these odds, and remains a force in state politics. They point to the federation's king-making role in the state's 2002 Democratic gubernatorial primary, where the union's candidate (Bill McBride) defeated a better-known and funded candidate (Janet Reno) and ran a strong campaign against a popular, wealthy incumbent (Gov. Jeb Bush).|$|E

2500|$|A {{secondary}} {{issue that}} disturbed the Southerners was {{the perception that}} the American Baptist Home Mission Society did not appoint a proportionate number of missionaries to the southern region of the US.
