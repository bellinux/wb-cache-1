5|$|Robert van Voren {{noted that}} {{after the fall of}} the Berlin Wall, it became {{apparent}} that the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR was only the tip of the iceberg, the sign that much more was basically wrong. This much more realistic image of Soviet psychiatry showed up only after the Soviet regime began to loosen its grip on society and later lost control over the developments and in the end entirely disintegrated. It demonstrated that the <b>actual</b> <b>situation</b> was much sorer and that many individuals had been affected. Millions of individuals were treated and stigmatized by an outdated biologically oriented and hospital-based mental health service. Living conditions in clinics were bad, sometimes even terrible, and violations of human rights were rampant. According to the data of a census published in 1992, the mortality of the ill with schizophrenia exceeded that of the general population by 4–6 times for the age of 20–39 years, by 3–4 times for the age of 30–39 years, by 1.5–2 times for the age over 40 years (larger values are for women).|$|E

25|$|District Judge Neighbour, {{referring}} to the Court of Appeal's judgment in Tan Kiam Peng v. Public Prosecutor (2008), held that the requirement of knowledge is satisfied if wilful blindness can be proved, as wilful blindness is, in law, a form of actual knowledge.

25|$|Actuarial science, of {{the kind}} used to project the future {{solvency}} of social security, is by nature subject to uncertainty. The SSA actually makes three predictions: optimistic, midline, and pessimistic (until the late 1980s it made 4 projections). The Social Security crisis that was developing prior to the 1983 reforms resulted from midline projections {{that turned out to}} be too optimistic. It has been argued that the overly pessimistic projections of the mid to late 1990s were partly the result of the low economic growth (according to actuary David Langer) assumptions that resulted in pushing back the projected exhaustion date (from 2028 to 2042) with each successive Trustee's report. During the heavy-boom years of the 1990s, the midline projections were too pessimistic. Obviously, projecting out 75 years is a significant challenge and, as such, the <b>actual</b> <b>situation</b> might be much better or much worse than predicted.|$|E
25|$|Still later, wind-tunnel {{testing was}} applied to automobiles, {{not so much to}} {{determine}} aerodynamic forces per se but more to determine ways to reduce the power required to move the vehicle on roadways at a given speed. In these studies, the interaction between the road and the vehicle plays a significant role, and this interaction must be taken into consideration when interpreting the test results. In an <b>actual</b> <b>situation</b> the roadway is moving relative to the vehicle but the air is stationary relative to the roadway, but in the wind tunnel the air is moving relative to the roadway, while the roadway is stationary relative to the test vehicle. Some automotive-test wind tunnels have incorporated moving belts under the test vehicle in an effort to approximate the actual condition, and very similar devices are used in wind tunnel testing of aircraft take-off and landing configurations.|$|E
40|$|We {{extend the}} {{ontology}} {{of the situation}} calculus {{to provide for the}} representation of time and event occurrences. We do this by defining a time line corresponding to a sequence of <b>situations</b> (called <b>actual</b> <b>situations)</b> beginning with the initial <b>situation.</b> <b>Actual</b> <b>situations</b> are totally ordered and the actions that lead to different <b>actual</b> <b>situations</b> are said to have occurred. This exension to the situation calculus permits one to express truths {{about the state of the}} world at different times. For example, we can state that at some point in the future certain fluent will be true. We can also express constraints on the occurrences of events, for example, that after releasing a cup, it will eventually hit the floor. Our version of the situation calculus subsumes other temporal logics. In particular, we show that the modal Temporal Logic of Concurrency [4] can be embedded in the extended situation calculus.

The royal income from Brazil paid for almost the entire reconstruction project, its cost amounting to over 20 million silver cruzados. The city also received emergency aid from England, Spain and the Hansa, and subsequently filled with construction sites. Most of the Portuguese aristocracy took refuge on their country estates around Lisbon, while King Joseph and his court took up residence in a huge complex of tents and barracks built in Ajuda, {{on the outskirts of the}} city. This became the centre of Portuguese political and social life for a couple of years after the great earthquake, while repairs were made on the royal palace in Belém, then still an area outside the city.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1891 Schiller had {{independently}} reached a doctrine {{very similar to}} William James' Will to Believe. As early as 1892 Schiller had independently developed his own pragmatist theory of truth. However, Schiller's concern with meaning was one he entirely imports from the pragmatisms of James and Peirce. Later in life Schiller musters all of these elements of his pragmatism to make a concerted attack on formal logic. Concerned with bringing down the timeless, perfect worlds of abstract metaphysics early in life, the central target of Schiller's developed pragmatism is the abstract rules of formal logic. Statements, Schiller contends, cannot possess meaning or truth abstracted away from their actual use. Therefore examining their formal features instead of their function in an <b>actual</b> <b>situation</b> {{is to make the}} same mistake the abstract metaphysician makes. Symbols are meaningless scratches on paper unless they are given a life in a situation, and meant by someone to accomplish some task. They are tools for dealing with concrete situations, and not the proper subjects of study themselves.|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time native {{occupants}} of Batavia, including the ethnic Betawi servants, became increasingly distrustful of the Chinese. Economic factors played a role: most natives were poor, and perceived the Chinese as occupying {{some of the most}} prosperous neighbourhoods in the city. Although the Dutch historian A.N. Paasman notes that at the time the Chinese were the [...] "Jews of Asia", the <b>actual</b> <b>situation</b> was more complicated. Many poor Chinese living in the area around Batavia were sugar mill workers who felt exploited by the Dutch and Chinese elites equally. Rich Chinese owned the mills and were involved in revenue farming and shipping; they drew income from milling and the distillation of arak, a molasses and rice-based alcoholic beverage. However, the Dutch overlords set the price for sugar, which itself caused unrest. Because of the decline of worldwide sugar prices that began in the 1720s caused by an increase in exports to Europe and competition from the West Indies, the sugar industry in the East Indies had suffered considerably. By 1740, worldwide sugar prices had dropped to half the price in 1720. As sugar was a major export, this caused considerable financial difficulties for the colony.|$|E

Versus XIII was defined by Nomura as {{the dark side of}} XIII, which was emphasized by the game's title. In 2008, it was reported that development was put on hold so the team could complete Final Fantasy XIII. This information was later clarified as a mistranslation, with the <b>actual</b> <b>situation</b> being that developers from the Versus XIII team were helping with XIII in their spare time, with development on both games going according to their original schedules. By June 2010, Nomura reported that the game's story, and the character and clothing designs had been completed. By June 2011, the game was reportedly still only in the pre-production phase. Full production on Versus XIII began in September of that year, and it was apparently planned for release in late 2014. According to later staff, Versus XIII was only 20-25% complete when the change of name and platform took place, with Tabata saying that the game [...] "never really took shape".
