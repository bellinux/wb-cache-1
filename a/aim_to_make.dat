Bamboo is considered {{to one of the}} most ecologically friendly materials for use in home furnishing and flooring, because it can be harvested without felling the entire tree. There is therefore no need for replanting, and the bamboo is allowed to regain its full height again over about five years, ready to be harvested again.|$|E
5|$|Grim Fandango {{takes place}} in the Land of the Dead (the Eighth Underworld), where {{recently}} departed souls <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> their way to the Land of Eternal Rest (the Ninth Underworld). Good deeds in life are rewarded by access to better travel packages to assist in making the journey of the soul, the best of which is the Number Nine, a train that takes four minutes to reach the gate to the Ninth Underworld. Souls who did not lead a kind life are left to travel through the Land of the Dead on foot, which would take around four years. Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs in the Land of the Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the mortal world to the Land of the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year on the Day of the Dead, these souls are allowed to visit their families in the Land of the Living.|$|E

25|$|Local {{oscillators}} typically {{generate a}} single frequency signal that has negligible amplitude modulation but some random phase modulation. Either of these impurities spreads {{some of the}} signal's energy into sideband frequencies. That causes a corresponding widening of the receiver's frequency response, which would defeat the <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a very narrow bandwidth receiver such as to receive low-rate digital signals. Care {{needs to be taken}} to minimize oscillator phase noise, usually by ensuring that the oscillator never enters a non-linear mode.|$|E

Thus, typically there is an <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the heat exchanger as long as physically possible whilst not exceeding production capabilities. However, there are many limitations for this, including space available at the installation site and the need to ensure tubes are available in lengths that are twice the required length (so they can be withdrawn and replaced). Also, long, thin tubes are difficult to take out and replace.|$|E

The league believed that this will allow the clubs to bond with their respective cities and towns and get support from local government, companies, and citizens. In other words, clubs {{will be able to}} rely on the locals, rather than major national sponsors.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of freight shipments between the EU, Russia and the Asian Pacific Region currently go by sea via the Suez Canal – a distance of between 17,000 and 22,000km. By extending the broad-gauge line, the promoters of the Košice–Vienna project <b>aim</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the Trans-Siberian Railway more competitive vis-à-vis the sea routes. By eliminating the need to change bogies, freight delivery times from East Asia to Europe will be cut by 14 days to just half of the time required for transportation by sea. And as {{there will be no}} freight transshipment the risk of accidental damage to cargo could be reduced. Russian Railways CEO Vladimir Yakunin believes it is the faster freight delivery that will make the project competitive.|$|E

500|$|As of 1998, Ratanakiri had 76 primary schools, one {{junior high}} school, and one high school. Education levels, {{particularly}} among Khmer Loeu, are very low. A 2002 survey of residents in six villages found {{that fewer than}} 10% of respondents had attended any primary school. Access to education is limited because of the expense of books, distance to schools, children's need to contribute to their families' livelihood, frequent absence of teachers, and instruction that is culturally inappropriate and in a language foreign to most students. Only 55% of Ratanakiri adults were literate as of 2013 (compared to 80% in Cambodia overall). Bilingual education initiatives, in which students begin instruction in native languages and gradually transition to instruction in Khmer, began in Ratanakiri in 2002 and {{appear to have been}} successful.

[...] Nima Baniamer from Contactmusic.com felt that [...] "there is nothing about the single that makes Bruno Mars stand out from all the other RnB artists dominating the charts at the moment", and said, [...] "The song never builds to any climax and it simply falls a bit flat, coming across quite corny and cheesy." ...|$|E
