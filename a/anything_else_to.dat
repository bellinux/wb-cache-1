5|$|The {{new state}} {{legislature}} had also appointed a five-man committee {{to select a}} city {{to be the new}} state capital. Scott applied to have Petersburg, still a fledgling settlement, designated as the capital. Other localities– including Frankfort, Lexington, Louisville, and Boonesborough– also applied. Frankfort was eventually chosen, as Scott's failure to secure Petersburg's designation as the state capital contributed more than <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> the settlement's failure to even become a viable city. Scott's son, Charles, Jr., wrote to his brother Daniel that their father was planning to run for Congress in 1792; although Charles, Jr. expressed confidence that his father would be elected, his campaign apparently never materialized or faltered shortly after it began. He was, however, chosen as a presidential elector in 1793.|$|E
25|$|Wherefore the Mutakallamin had, before <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> <b>to</b> {{establish}} {{a system of}} philosophy to demonstrate the creation of matter, and they adopted to that end the theory of atoms as enunciated by Democritus. They taught that atoms possess neither quantity nor extension. Originally atoms were created by God, and are created now as occasion seems to require. Bodies come into existence or die, through the aggregation or the sunderance of these atoms. But this theory did not remove the objections of philosophy to a creation of matter.|$|E
25|$|Causal determinism: The {{idea that}} {{everything}} is caused by prior conditions, {{making it impossible for}} <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> happen. In its most common form, nomological (or scientific) determinism, future events are necessitated by past and present events combined with the laws of nature. Such determinism is sometimes illustrated by the thought experiment of Laplace's demon. Imagine an entity that knows all facts about the past and the present, and knows all natural laws that govern the universe. If the laws of nature were determinate, then such an entity would be able to use this knowledge to foresee the future, down to the smallest detail.|$|E

25|$|The {{supporters}} of Caesar argued that Caesar deserved {{an extension of}} his command so that the fruit of his success would not be lost. There was a debate on this. Pompey showed goodwill towards Caesar. He claimed that he had letters from Caesar {{in which he said}} he wanted to be relieved of his command, but he said that he thought that he should be allowed to stand for the consulship in absentia. Cato opposed this and said that if Caesar wanted this he had to lay down his arms and become a private citizen. Pompey did not contest Cato's view. This gave rise to suspicions about his real feelings towards Caesar. Plutarch wrote that Pompey also asked Caesar for the troops he had lent him back, using the Parthian war as a pretext. Although Caesar knew why Pompey asked this he sent the troops back home with generous gifts. Appian wrote that Caesar gave these soldiers a donation and also sent one of his legions to Rome. Pompey was drifting toward the optimates and away from Caesar. According to Plutarch the rift between Pompey and Cato became accentuated when Pompey fell seriously ill in Naples in 50 BC. When he recovered the people of Naples offered thanksgiving sacrifices. This celebration spread throughout Italy. He was feted in towns he travelled to on his way back to Rome. Plutarch wrote that this was said ‘to have done more than <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> bring about the subsequent civil war’. It made Pompey arrogant, incautious and contemptuous of Caesar’s power. The following year the two men were fighting each other in the Great Roman Civil War.|$|E
500|$|The {{nature of}} the targets and the risks {{involved}} in striking (and re-striking) them began to take a toll. Chief of Naval Operations David McDonald reported to his co-chiefs after a trip to South Vietnam in September 1966, that Rolling Thunder aircrews were angered with the targeting process and that they faulted the campaign due to [...] "guidelines requiring repetitive air programs that seemed more than <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> benefit enemy gunners." [...] During 1967, the second full year of Rolling Thunder operations, 362 U.S. aircraft had been lost over North Vietnam (208 Air Force, 142 Navy, and 12 Marine Corps).|$|E

He never considered himself a typical songwriter, preferring to create whole albums of {{music with a}} theme, later saying [...] "if {{the words came out}} like the music, and we didn't have <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> do, then quite a few would be written". A number of compositions credited to Wright came out of improvisation and randomly trying ideas, some of which were picked up enthusiastically by his band mates. Wright later said [...] "I just play and don't really think about what I'm doing, I just let it happen". Of all the Pink Floyd members, Wright was the most reserved, sitting down behind the keyboards and concentrating on the music.|$|E

As the group listened to a playback of the chorus, Richie declared that the last part of the line should be changed to [...] "We're 'saving' our own lives", which his fellow musicians agreed with. Producer Jones also suggested altering the former part of the line. [...] "One thing we don't want to do, especially with this group, is look like we're patting ourselves on the back. So it's really, 'There's a choice we're making.'" [...] Around 1:30am, the four musicians ended the night by finishing a chorus of melodic vocalizations, including the sound [...] "sha-lum sha-lin-gay". Jones told the group that they were not to add <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> the tape. [...] "If we get too good, someone's gonna start playing it on the radio," [...] he announced.|$|E
500|$|The Strawberry Panic! {{short stories}} were {{initially}} panned by Erica Friedman as being [...] "distinctly derivative of Maria-sama ga Miteru". Friedman {{is the president}} of Yuricon, an anime convention geared towards fans of yuri anime and manga, and ALC Publishing, a publishing house dedicated to yuri. Friedman described the stories as, [...] "candy apples without the apples - all sugary, and gooey and sweet, with not much of <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> support it". After initially having this stance for the entire series, including an early opinion on the anime version, Friedman later changed her opinion slightly, writing that [...] " [...] turned out pretty good". She went on to say, [...] "There's no denying that Strawberry Panic! wasn't brilliant, but considering that {{it was meant to be}} trashy, it pulled out a few moments of dignity and elegance out of the trash heap." [...] Jason Thompson regarded the Strawberry Panic! manga as [...] "a nearly plotless cascade [...] everything seems rushed, and it is difficult to keep track of the characters and plot." ...|$|E

To Andy's great dismay, they earn 5,000 points {{by the end of}} the day. When Andy and the crew go to the tattoo parlor, Andy backs down and admits to Jim that he is not sure why Robert made him manager. Jim reassures Andy that he managed to pick up sales, and that no one in the office expects him to go through with the tattoo idea. Pepped up by Jim's talk, Andy enthusiastically agrees to getting the tattoo, which Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) changes, without telling Andy, to an image of a dog that has [...] "Nard" [...] written on it, a reference to Andy's nickname [...] "Nard Dog." [...] Upon seeing his completed tattoo in a mirror, Andy is pleased with the result. Robert then reveals to the cameras that he picked Andy because he is an uncomplicated choice which causes people to rally behind him, because he is an underdog. Meanwhile, Pam and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) become walking buddies at Angela's request, but after Angela says she's reported Pam to Social Services for drinking herbal tea out of coffee mugs while pregnant, a disgusted Pam tells Angela they should not have <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> do with each other.|$|E

500|$|Nick Levin of Digital Spy {{reviewed}} The Time of Our Lives, saying that, {{although not}} offering much original material, it did {{provide evidence that}} Cyrus could successfully dump her Disney Channel-affiliated image. He said that each of [...] "the six genuinely new songs" [...] are worth listening to, resulting in a worthwhile EP release. Michael Hann of The Guardian felt that Cyrus managed to project a very wholesome image of herself but argued {{that she did not}} succeed in convincing adult audiences there was <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> her: [...] "She has her name on plenty of inventive, imaginative and precisely calibrated examples of modern chart pop, songs that would have been noticed beyond her audience of young girls had they come from a more credible source". Jessica Holland of British newspaper The Observer wrote a favorable review of the EP, noting: [...] "Still not yet 17, Miley doesn't need to worry about slipping yet." [...] Jaime Gill of Yahoo! Music described the uptempo numbers on the EP as [...] "brilliantly feisty skate pop" [...] but described the record's ballads as tedious. Gill concluded that, if Cyrus were to take her music more seriously, instead of releasing albums in between various other projects, she might make a great pop album and stated that [...] "As it is, The Time Of Our Lives is a great pop EP drowning in a sea of bilge." ...|$|E
500|$|Starship Troopers is {{generally}} considered to promote militarism, the glorification of war and of the military. Scholar Bruce Franklin referred to it in 1980 as a [...] "bugle-blowing, drum-beating glorification" [...] of military service, and wrote that militarism and imperialism were the explicit message of the book. Science fiction writer Dean McLaughlin called it [...] "a book-length recruiting poster". In 1968 science fiction critic Alexei Panshin called Starship Troopers a militaristic polemic and compared it to a recruiting film, stating that it [...] "purports to show {{the life of a}} typical soldier, with a soundtrack commentary by earnest sincere Private Jones who interprets what we see for us." [...] Panshin stated that there was no [...] "sustained human conflict" [...] in the book: instead, [...] "All the soldiers we see are tough, smart, competent, cleancut, clean-shaven, and noble." [...] Panshin, a veteran of the peacetime military, argued that Heinlein glossed over the reality of military life, and that the Terran Federation-Arachnid conflict existed simply because, [...] "Starship troopers are not half so glorious sitting on their butts polishing their weapons for the tenth time for lack of <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] Literature scholar George Slusser, in describing the novel as [...] "wrong-headed and retrogressive", argued that calling its ideology militarism or imperialism was inadequate, as these descriptions suggested an economic motive. Slusser instead says that Heinlein advocates for a complete [...] "technological subjugation of nature", of which the Arachnids are a symbol, and that this subjugation itself is depicted as a sign of human advancement.|$|E
500|$|Benfica began March {{competing}} {{at three}} levels: the Primeira Liga, the Portuguese Cup and the UEFA Cup. Their first game {{was at the}} Estádio José Alvalade against Sporting CP. Managed by Paulo Bento, the hosts scored the opening goal in the 11th minute with a header by Simon Vukčević. In the 40th minute, Rui Costa's corner kick allowed Cardozo to head in the tying goal. Benfica held second place, five points ahead of Sporting. For Camacho, the result was [...] "very important because we kept our advantage, allowing us to remain in second place". The following Thursday, Benfica hosted Getafe in the UEFA Cup. The match quickly soured for the club when Cardozo was sent off in the ninth minute, and Rubén de la Red scored Getafe's first goal in the 25th minute. During the second half Pablo Hernández added another, and Mantorras scored a 76th-minute consolation goal for Benfica. Camacho said, [...] "We started poorly because Getafe has a good team. With Cardozo's ejection, things got more complicated. In the second half, Benfica was better, the players fought and showed {{we have a chance}} to eliminate them." [...] On 9 March, Benfica hosted União de Leiria. They conceded an opening goal in the 42th minute, scoring two second-half goals in five minutes: one each by Zoro and Cardozo. Serge N'Gal scored a 69th-minute equaliser for the draw. The result had repercussions, as Camacho resigned: [...] "I cannot do <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> improve this team's performance." [...] His resignation, so late in the season, caught Benfica's management by surprise. They opted to not replace him, nominating his assistant Fernando Chalana as manager. Chalana accepted the challenge: [...] "I am here through thick and thin." [...] His first game as manager was against Getafe on the road on 12 March. Benfica had to score two and allow none to progress; Makukula hit the post in the sixth minute, and Getafe qualified with a 77th-minute goal by Juan Ángel Albín. Four days later, Benfica played Marítimo at Barreiros, with Cardozo scoring his 19th goal of the season in the 26th minute. In the second half, Ytalo scored a 75th-minute equaliser for Marítimo. Chalana said, [...] "We had a great first half. We dominated and honestly I was not expecting Marítimo's goal. I was sad with the way it appeared. We did everything to win." [...] The fourth consecutive draw cost Benfica their lead over Vitória de Guimarães for second place. Back from international break, the club hosted Paços de Ferreira on 30 March in a 4–1 win. At half-time, the score was 1–1, but Cardozo and Rui Costa's second-half goals gave Benfica their first domestic win in March.|$|E

When Sun Quan sought Kan Ze's opinion on this, the latter replied that burning and dismemberment should be not be used as means of execution in a civilised age. Sun Quan heeded his advice and probably had Lü Yi executed by beheading.|$|E
