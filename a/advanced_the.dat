5|$|After another Falcon punt, the Hokies {{took over}} on offense at their 49-yard line with 4:12 {{remaining}} before halftime. Tech began advancing the ball, and was {{aided by a}} 15-yard penalty against Air Force that pushed the Hokies deep into Falcons territory. Running backs Kevin Jones and Lee Suggs <b>advanced</b> <b>the</b> ball {{on the ground with}} short rushes, and Randall contributed short passes at times, gaining needed first downs when required.

Tech gained four yards on three plays, but was unable to cross the goal line for another touchdown. Tech kicker Warley entered the game to attempt his second field goal try of the game.
