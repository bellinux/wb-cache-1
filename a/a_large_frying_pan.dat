50|$|As a stew, it {{is unique}} in that all the main {{ingredients}} are cut into slices, so as to lie flat. Because of this, it is normally cooked in <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>frying</b> <b>pan,</b> {{on top of the}} stove, and served on a plate (as opposed to a bowl). The vegetables used are typically potatoes, onions, carrots (sliced lengthwise) and peas. Although usually made with smoked bacon, minced beef is occasionally substituted.|$|E

Have <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>frying</b> <b>pan</b> ready with hot butter. Be sure and have the butter run all over {{the inside of the}} pan so the pancake will not stick to the sides when it rises. Pour in the batter and place in oven. When nearly done, powder with sugar and put back in oven to brown. Serve with lemon and powdered sugar.|$|E
50|$|The common {{ingredients}} of Indonesian egg martabak, besides the dough, is seasoned ground meat (beef, chicken or mutton), sliced green onions, some herbs (optional), beaten eggs, salt and potatoes. Some street vendors mix the ground beef with curry seasoning. In Indonesia, the common spices {{to make the}} seasoned ground meat are shallots, garlic, ginger, cumin, coriander, turmeric, some salt and sometimes {{a little bit of}} monosodium glutamate. All the spices are ground or minced and stir-fried altogether. Some martabak makers add extra ingredients and other varieties to make their martabak unique, but they all share the same main dough. To fry martabak, the chef uses <b>a</b> very <b>large</b> flat <b>frying</b> <b>pan</b> or iron griddle. Usually they use vegetable oil to fry, but {{it is not uncommon to}} use ghee or butter too.Before serving, martabak usually is cut into portions. Sometimes it is eaten with sweet and salty soy sauce and pepper. Savoury versions of martabak in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore usually is served with acar or pickled condiment consisting of diced cucumber, sliced carrot, shallots and sliced chillies in sweetened vinegar. In Malaysia, Singapore and some areas in Sumatra, martabak is served with kari (curry) gravy. In Palembang, another variety of martabak is egg-martabak (eggs dropped into the flatten dough before folded while frying) served in curry (usually diced potatoes in beef curry) and topped with chillies in sweet-sour soy sauce called Martabak Haji Abdul Rozak, or more commonly known as Martabak HAR, made popular by an Indian Indonesian named Haji Abdul Rozak. There is also a popular martabak variant from Padang, West Sumatra called Martabak Kubang, which is served with light curry as dipping sauce.|$|R

50|$|A basic cacciatore recipe usually {{begins with}} a couple of tablespoons of olive oil heated in <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>frying</b> <b>pan.</b> Chicken parts, dusted with salt and pepper, are seared in the oil for three to four minutes on each side. The chicken is removed from the pan, and most of the fat poured off. The {{remaining}} fat is used to fry the onions, peppers or other vegetables for several minutes. A small can of peeled tomatoes (drained of liquid and chopped coarsely) is typically added to the pan along with rosemary and a half cup of dry red wine. Bay leaf may be used, along with chopped carrot to give extra sweetness. The seared chicken parts are returned to the pan which is then covered. The dish is done after about an hour at a very low simmer. Cacciatore is often served with a rustic bread or pasta on the side.|$|E

He is jealous of Harlequin, to whom Cassander wants to give his daughter. Without Harlequin's seeing him do it, he annoys him with his fishing line. Thinking Cassander is to blame, Harlequin punches the old man, knocking him to the ground. Columbine, indignant, slaps Harlequin's face. Pierrot, after having helped Cassander up, tries to goad Harlequin into a fight. The latter refuses. [...] "I don't fight with a valet", he says. And to calm Cassander, he gives him an enormous watch. Cassander softens, and shushes Pierrot, who wants to swoop down on his rival. In {{the midst of this}} brawl, Cassander receives the blows of the two combatants. Columbine, to calm Pierrot, whom she loves, gives him her flower without being seen by Harlequin.|$|E

50|$|The Delmarva Chicken Festival is {{an annual}} event {{sponsored}} by Delmarva Poultry Industry, Inc started in 1948 {{with the purpose of}} publicizing the Delmarva Peninsula with an emphasis on its arguably most important agricultural enterprise, raising chickens. The two-day event hosted in various locales on Delmarva features trade shows, arts and crafts, carnival, entertainment, and food concessions. Chicken is, of course, the featured food, but french fries, corn-on-the-cob, funnel cake, ice cream, kettle corn, and fresh-squeezed lemonade are other local favorites. Nearly three tons of chicken are cooked each year in the world's <b>largest</b> <b>frying</b> <b>pan.</b> The pan made its debut at the second annual festival in 1950. The first and original pan was used and made by the Mumford Sheet Metal Company in Selbyville, Delaware. It was ten feet in diameter and had an eight-foot handle, weighed 650 pounds and could hold 800 chicken quarters. The 60th Annual Delmarva Chicken Festival took place June 19 and 20, 2009 in Centreville, Maryland, United States.|$|R

5000|$|There are {{two primary}} ways {{to prepare the}} fish (most popularly, sole or trout). One is by sautéing—first {{dredging}} the fish in seasoned flour (white flour or corn flour) and then cooking in a hot sauté pan {{with a small amount}} of clarified butter. The alternative method is to pan-fry or deep fry the floured fish. In <b>pan</b> <b>frying,</b> oil or a combination of oil and butter is used—up to perhaps 2 cm deep. Deep frying is done in either <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>fry</b> pot or in a stand-alone deep fryer. The floured fish is completely submerged in the hot oil. The frying techniques result in a crisper texture, but the sauce will need to be made separately. The sautéed fish will have a softer skin by comparison, but allows for the possibility of creating the sauce [...] after the fish has been removed by adding fresh butter, parsley, and lemon.|$|R
