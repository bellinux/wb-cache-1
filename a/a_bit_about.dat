Reddington insists on working exclusively with Elizabeth Keen (Megan Boone), a profiler who had just been hired. Reddington knows quite <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> Keen, which convinces her and the SAIC to acquiesce to Reddington’s plan. Zamani plans to kidnap and booby trap the daughter of a general responsible for destroying a chemical weapons factory that poisoned Zamani's family.|$|E

500|$|However, Hergé knew {{as little}} about China {{as he did}} about the Soviet Union or the Belgian Congo. At the time most Belgians held to a {{negative}} stereotype of China, viewing it as [...] "a distant continent of a nation, barbaric, overpopulated, and inscrutable", and Hergé had long believed this view. He had included Chinese characters in two previous Adventures, in both instances depicting them according to traditional European clichés. In Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, he included two pigtailed Chinese men hired by the Bolsheviks to torture Tintin, while in Tintin in America he featured two Chinese hoodlums who plotted to eat Snowy. Hergé learned <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> the country from Albert Londres' book China Madness, based on Londres' experiences in the country. He was also influenced in his portrayal of China by the 1933 German film Flüchtlinge (At the End of the World).|$|E

As reported by Rap-Up, Beyoncé filmed the clip in the Oakdale Mobile Home Park in South Brunswick Township, New Jersey, on August 2, 2011. The video shoot called for multiple flashy fashions, a red muscle car, and colorfully dressed dancers. Solange Knowles, Beyoncé's younger sister, and Kelly Rowland, former Destiny's Child member, both made cameos.

500|$|Lagaan was {{met with}} high {{critical}} acclaim. The film currently scores a 95% [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] approval rating on review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critical consensus is, [...] "Lagaan is lavish, rousing entertainment in the old-fashioned tradition of Hollywood musicals." [...] Derek Elley of Variety suggested that it [...] "could be the trigger for Bollywood's long-awaited crossover to non-ethnic markets". Somni Sengupta of The New York Times, described it as [...] "a carnivalesque genre packed with romance, swordplay and improbable song-and-dance routines" [...] Roger Ebert gave three and half out of four stars and said, [...] "Lagaan is an enormously entertaining movie, like nothing we've ever seen before, and yet completely familiar... At the same time, it's a memory of the films we all grew up on, with clearly defined villains and heroes, a romantic triangle, and even a comic character who saves the day. Lagaan is a well-crafted, hugely entertaining epic that has the spice of a foreign culture." [...] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian described the film as [...] "a lavish epic, a gorgeous love story, and a rollicking adventure yarn. Larger than life and outrageously enjoyable, it's got a dash of spaghetti western, a hint of Kurosawa, with a bracing shot of Kipling." [...] Kuljinder Singh of the BBC stated that [...] "Lagaan is anything but standard Bollywood fodder, and is the first must-see of the Indian summer. A movie that will have you laughing and crying, but leaving with a smile." [...] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times argued that the film is [...] "an affectionate homage to a popular genre that raises it {{to the level of}} an art film with fully drawn characters, a serious underlying theme, and a sophisticated style and point of view." [...] Sudish Kamath of The Hindu suggested that [...] "the movie is not just a story. It is an experience. An experience of watching something that puts life into you, that puts a cheer on your face, however depressed you might be." [...] The Times of India wrote, [...] "Lagaan has all the attractions of big-sounding A. R. Rahman songs, excellent performances by Aamir Khan... and a successful debut for pretty Gracy Singh. In addition, there is the celebrated David vs Goliath cricket match, which has audiences screaming and clapping." [...] Perhaps one of the most emphatic recommendations for the movie, coming 10 years later, is by John Nugent of the Trenton Independent, who wrote [...] "a masterpiece ... and what better way to learn <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> India's colonial experience! History and great entertainment, all rolled in to one (albeit long) classic film." ...|$|E

[...] As the series continued, however, Bolland became increasingly meticulous, [...] "trying to make the pages look better and better". The added details he introduced into his artwork caused significant delays in the final issues of the limited series, causing issues #8–11 to be released on a quarterly rather than monthly status, and the final issue to be cover dated nine months later than the penultimate issue.|$|E

[...] In January 1971, Nixon hosted Juan Carlos and his wife Sofia (sister of the exiled King Constantine) during a visit to Washington and later that year the Washington Post published an article alleging that Nixon's administration was seeking to get Franco to retire in favour of the young Bourbon prince.|$|E

It would have been unwise for all four to descend into the couloir, because they did not know where to fix the rope that would be needed on their return. Time pressed: it was necessary to reduce the numbers of the party; Gorret sacrificed himself, and Meynet stopped with him. Very soon afterwards Carrel and Bich were finally on the top. Meanwhile Giordano at Breuil was writing in his diary as follows: [...] "Splendid weather; at 9.30 saw Carrel and his men on the Shoulder, after that saw nothing more of them.

2500|$|On 1 December 2009, the {{companion}} book The Good Game Gamer's Guide to Good Gaming (...) was released.

I was impressed and intrigued – but not overawed. My journey to Japan was a personal spiritual quest and I realised that this man was someone you only get to be around once – he was a true mystic. Over the coming months and years I was to see him on a daily basis (when he was in Tokyo). As a karate man with both Judo and Jujitsu experience, I was not easily impressed by people flying through the air for apparently no reason. I had made a huge effort by modern standards to be there to learn what was on offer but – over the first few months I began to think – 'Can this really be true, these guys are just falling over...' Then, little by little, as other guys who had 'gone for him' described their bewildering experiences of falling ( [...] for no good reason [...] ) and also my own careful observations of the reactions of his Ukes – I was convinced that this man was incredible." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rothenberg {{said he had}} {{not always}} planned on killing Lexa, but the fact that Debnam-Carey was {{simultaneously}} on another show (Fear the Walking Dead), and was therefore unlikely to ever become a series regular on The 100, he felt use of the character would be limited or absent in the future. This is when the writers decided to craft a death scene for her to propel the story forward. [...] "I remember as we were breaking the season, we talked about reincarnation in the Grounder world and how that was how commanders were selected. I didn't want to throw that out as nonsense, which is how Clarke had received it, but I also didn't want {{to say that it was}} real reincarnation," [...] he said, adding he had been reading The Singularity Is Near by Ray Kurzweil at the time, which [...] "talks quite <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> a future where we'll be able to upload our minds—literally upload our consciousness—into a computer and live forever." [...] This gave Rothenberg the idea for incorporating a [...] "technological reincarnation" [...] storyline. [...] "The commander A.I. would need to be able to pass itself from person to person over time and [...] Lexa was just the most recent recipient of this artificial intelligence augmentation of her consciousness. So once we came up with that idea, that was the point at which everything jelled and sort of came together storytelling-wise," [...] he stated. [...] "And of course, if you're dealing with a story about reincarnation, you've got to die before you can be reincarnated. So Lexa dying became a very tragic necessity." [...] Rothenberg said Clarke was in love with Lexa, that they were soulmates, and Lexa's death will haunt Clarke. [...] " [...] is going to have to figure out how to compartmentalize, the way that all of us have to do in the real world when people are suddenly and tragically taken away from us," [...] he added. [...] "That's kind of the point of The 100 in many ways. These horrible things happen and yet we still have to figure out a way to move on and be the heroes of our own stories." ...|$|E
