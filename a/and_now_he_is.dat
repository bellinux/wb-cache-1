[...] Prospects of collaboration between him and Gibbs were cut short by Maxwell's early death in 1879, aged 48.

500|$|It was {{not until}} Wenger's arrival in October 1996 that Arsenal reemerged as a serious league competitor. By {{the end of the}} 1996–97 season, Manchester United amassed their fourth title in five seasons, whereas Arsenal {{finished}} the campaign in third – their highest position since the formation of the Premier League in 1992. During the season, Wenger commented on rule changes which permitted an extension to the league calendar: [...] "It's wrong the programme is extended so Manchester United can rest and win everything." [...] His observation irked Ferguson, who replied: [...] "He has no experience of English football. He has come here from Japan, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> telling everyone how to organise our football. Unless you have been in the situation and had the experience then he should keep his mouth shut, firmly shut." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1553 Servetus {{published}} Christianismi Restitutio (English: The Restoration of Christianity), {{in which}} he rejected the Christian doctrine of the Trinity {{and the concept of}} predestination. In the same year, Calvin's representative, Guillaume de Trie, sent letters alerting the French Inquisition to Servetus. Calling him a [...] "Spanish-Portuguese", suspecting and accusing him of his recently proved Jewish converso origin. De Trie wrote down that [...] "his proper name is Michael Servetus, but he currently calls himself Villeneuve, practising medicine. He stayed for some time in Lyon, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> living in Vienne." [...] When the inquisitor-general of France learned that Servetus was hiding in Vienne, according to Calvin under an assumed name, he contacted Cardinal François de Tournon, the secretary of the archbishop of Lyon, to take up the matter. Servetus was arrested and taken in for questioning. His letters to Calvin were presented as evidence of heresy, but he denied having written them, and later said he was not sure it was his handwriting. He said, after swearing before the holy gospel, that [...] "he was Michel De Villeneuve Doctor in Medicine about 42 years old, native of Tudela of the kingdom of Navarre, a city under the obedience to the Emperor". The following day he said: [...] "..although he was not Servetus he assumed the person of Servet for debating with Calvin". He managed to escape from prison, and the Catholic authorities sentenced him in absentia to death by slow burning.|$|E
500|$|BBC Online {{described}} Oliver's positive qualities {{as being}} his [...] "boyishly charming" [...] manner and his general determination. Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror deemed him a [...] "soft touch" [...] {{when he went}} to great lengths to help a young patient, and a Daily Mail review suggested that Oliver was [...] "really quite sweet", despite his apparent smugness. Oliver is flawed by a lack of confidence and his deceptive nature. He has a tendency to land his work colleagues in trouble, which has been conveyed through storylines with Daisha and Greg. What's on TV highlighted Oliver's [...] "lack of competence" [...] and called him petulant for betraying Penny after his promotion to F2 level. When his career began to deteriorate, the publication deemed him reckless, then found him hapless in the aftermath of her death, in reference to the way he [...] " [...] into despair, finding comfort in drink, drugs and his dead sister's flatmate." [...] The Sunday Mirror Kevin O'Sullivan reflected on Oliver's development since his arrival, with the observation, [...] "Once he was the strutting ladies' man of the wards, a veritable medical Casanova who exuded confidence and charm.

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his past. A Rolling Stone {{reviewer}} called the song a [...] "breakup aria". According to Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian, [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] stands out for its [...] "slow-building sense of drama", which highlights Timberlake at his [...] "husky best". The song begins with the phrase [...] "You were my sun, you were my earth", which according to Timbaland was Timberlake's inspiration to write the song. Tanya L. Edwards of MTV News observed that Timberlake was wronged and said this is demonstrated by the lyrics: [...] "You don't have to say whatcha did / I already know, I found out from him / Now there's just no chance." [...] The chorus contains the lines: [...] "Told me you loved me, {{why did you leave}} me all alone / Now you tell me you need me when you call me on the phone." [...] Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani called Timberlake's 2007 single [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around" [...] an ostensible sequel to [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] both lyrically and musically. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard stated that aside from the presence of Timbaland's [...] "fantastically cluttered production", the difference between [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] and Timberlake's 2013 single [...] "Mirrors" [...] is clear: [...] "10 years ago, Timberlake was broken, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> whole".|$|E
2500|$|His undated poem, Mi último adiós {{believed}} to be written {{a few days before}} his execution, was hidden in an alcohol stove, which was later handed to his family with his few remaining possessions, including the final letters and his last bequests. During their visit, Rizal reminded his sisters in English, [...] "There is something inside it", referring to the alcohol stove given by the Pardo de Taveras which was to be returned after his execution, thereby emphasizing the importance of the poem. This instruction was followed by another, [...] "Look in my shoes", in which another item was secreted. Exhumation of his remains in August 1898, under American rule, revealed he had been uncoffined, his burial not on sanctified ground granted the 'confessed' faithful, and whatever was in his shoes had disintegrated. <b>And</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> buried in Rizal Monument in Manila.|$|E

In comments to ESPN, Kauzlarich said: [...] "These people have a hard time letting it go. It may be because of their religious beliefs" [...] and [...] "When you die, I mean, there is supposedly a better life, right? Well, if you are an atheist and you don't believe in anything, if you die, what is there to go to? Nothing. You are worm dirt.

2500|$|Xu Wen {{continued}} {{to maintain control}} of the Wu governance. [...] This led to resentment {{by a number of}} Wu's senior generals — Liu Wei (劉威) the military governor of Zhennan Circuit, Tao Ya (陶雅) the governor (觀察使, Guanchashi) of She Prefecture (歙州, in modern Huangshan, Anhui), Li Yu (李遇) the governor of Xuan Prefecture (宣州, in modern Xuancheng, Anhui), and Li Jian (李簡) the prefect of Chang Prefecture (常州, in modern Changzhou, Jiangsu) — each of whom had greater accomplishments and had higher standing in the army than Xu did when Yang Xingmi was alive. [...] Li Yu was particularly unhappy, often stating, [...] "Who is this Xu Wen? [...] I do not even remember his face, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> ruling the state!" [...] On an occasion when the officer Xu Jie was on a diplomatic mission to Wu's southeastern neighbor Wuyue, Xu Wen had Xu Jie stop by in Xuan Prefecture to try to persuade Li Yu to show submission by going to Guangling to pay homage to Yang Longyan. [...] Li Yu initially agreed, but Xu Jie inadvertently stated, [...] "If you, Lord, do not do so, people will say that you are committing treason." [...] Li Yu angrily responded, [...] "You, sir, are saying that I, Li Yu, am treasonous. [...] Is it not more treasonous to murder the Shizhong ?" [...] When Xu Wen heard this, he became angry and sent the general Chai Zaiyong (柴再用), with Xu Wen's adoptive son Xu Zhigao serving as Chai's deputy, to attack Li Yu at Xuan. [...] Li Yu's initially was able to hold against Chai's attacks, but Xu Wen put Li Yu's youngest son, who was serving as an officer at Huainan headquarters, under arrest, and had him displayed at the army. [...] Xu Wen then sent the official He Rao (何蕘) to, in Yang Longyan's name, state to Li Yu: [...] "If you, Lord, are planning on rebelling, please execute He Rao to show yourself. [...] Otherwise, follow him out of the city." [...] Li Yu thus surrendered. [...] Xu Wen had Chai kill Li Yu and slaughter his household, and it was said that after this event, all the generals were fearful of Xu and did not dare to resist him further.|$|E
