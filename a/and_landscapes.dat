5|$|Cacti {{may also}} be planted {{outdoors}} in regions with suitable climates.

Cacti are one group of drought-resistant plants recommended for dry landscape gardening.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} joint {{production}} of milk <b>and</b> ‘wildlife <b>and</b> <b>landscape</b> services’ on Dutch dairy farms using a micro-econometric profit model of individual farm behaviour. Results show that milk, <b>and</b> wildlife <b>and</b> <b>landscape</b> services, are substitutes. Moreover, there are {{economies of scope}} for only relatively few farms. Both results imply that most farms would prefer specialising instead of jointly producing milk <b>and</b> wildlife <b>and</b> <b>landscape</b> services. Lower transaction costs increase wildlife <b>and</b> <b>landscape</b> services production by existing providers, and {{increase the number of}} farms producing wildlife <b>and</b> <b>landscape</b> services.

5|$|Before Lucas {{had started}} writing, his {{producing}} partner Rick McCallum {{was preparing for}} the film. McCallum stated that his experience with The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles led to many of his decisions on The Phantom Menace, such as long-term deals with actors and soundstages, the employment of recent graduates with no film experience, {{and the creation of}} sets <b>and</b> <b>landscapes</b> with digital technology. In April 1994, McCallum started searching for artists in art, architecture and design schools, and in mid-year he began location scouting with production designer Gavin Bocquet. Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) art director Doug Chiang impressed McCallum the most and was hired as the design director.|$|E

In February 1862, Rossier was again in Shanghai, where he sold his cameras and other photographic equipment before embarking for Europe.

Skagen Church was inaugurated in 1841, and the first guest house in the town opened in 1844. In 1858, the grey lighthouse was inaugurated. The same year, bye-laws were established specifying building requirements including the completion of tiled roofs within five years. Skagen was struck by the cholera epidemic of 1853.|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War, brutalist {{tower blocks}} were adopted as a {{solution}} and this period saw the building of new towns, including Glenrothes and Cumbernauld, but the social and building problems of these constructions soon became apparent. The creation of new towns and council house estates necessitated the rapid supply of new churches. From the 1980s Scottish architecture began to recover its reputation, with new buildings like that created to house the Burrell Collection in Glasgow and more recently the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh. There has also been urban regeneration, involving the replacement and renovation of existing buildings <b>and</b> <b>landscapes.</b> The 1980s saw the growth of speculative house building by developers {{and the introduction of}} English brick and half-timbered vernacular styles to Scotland. As the production of state sponsored housing subsided in the 1970s there was a return to conservatism in church design, but there were some original and post-modern designs from the 1980s.|$|E

During the verse, intercut scenes include various shadows of children holding instruments behind Amuro. The chorus opens with Amuro walking down along a bridge with the children playing their instruments behind her. When the second chorus starts, the camera pans over to several buildings <b>and</b> <b>landscapes</b> around Los Angeles.

5|$|Felice Beato (1832 – 29 January 1909), {{also known}} as Felix Beato, was an Italian–British photographer. He {{was one of the}} first people to take {{photographs}} in East Asia and one of the first war photographers. He is noted for his genre works, portraits, and views and panoramas of the architecture <b>and</b> <b>landscapes</b> of Asia and the Mediterranean region. Beato's travels gave him the opportunity to create images of countries, people, and events that were unfamiliar and remote to most people in Europe and North America. His work provides images of such events as the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the Second Opium War, and represents the first substantial body of photojournalism. He had an impact on other photographers, and his influence in Japan, where he taught and worked with numerous other photographers and artists, was particularly deep and lasting.|$|E

The phenomenon of a historically created cultural landscape has been discussed, where there are no borders between <b>landscape</b> <b>and</b> architecture, i. e. architecture has blended with the <b>landscape</b> <b>and</b> should be seen as a comprehensive whole...|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century Scottish {{scientists}} James Clerk Maxwell and David Brewster played a major part {{in the development of the}} techniques of photography. Pioneering photographers included chemist Robert Adamson (1821–48) and artist David Octavius Hill (1821–48), who as Hill & Adamson formed the first photographic studio in Scotland at Rock House in Edinburgh in 1843. Their output of around 3,000 calotype images in four years are considered some of the first and finest artistic uses of photography. Other pioneers included Thomas Annan (1829–87), who took portraits <b>and</b> <b>landscapes,</b> and whose photographs of the Glasgow slums were among the first to use the medium as a social record. His son James Craig Annan (1864–1946) popularised the work of Hill & Adamson in the US and worked with American photographic pioneer Alfred Stieglitz (1864–1946). Both pioneered the more stable photogravure process. Other important figures included Thomas Keith (1827–95), one of the first architectural photographers, George Washington Wilson (1823–93), who pioneered instant photography and Clementina Hawarden (1822–65), whose posed portraits were among the first in a tradition of female photography.|$|E
5|$|In the {{opinions}} then current at the Royal Academy and among critics, {{the most prestigious}} form of painting was considered history painting, in which an artwork illustrated a story. It was thought that such works enabled British artists to show themselves as equal or even superior to those European artists active at the time, {{as well as to}} the Old Masters. Other forms of painting such as portraiture <b>and</b> <b>landscapes</b> were considered lesser styles, as they did not give the artist as much opportunity to illustrate a story but instead were simply depictions of reality. Nonetheless, even the most eminent artists would often devote time to portrait painting, as portraits were generally commissioned by the subjects or their families, providing a guaranteed source of income to the artist; two of the first three presidents of the Royal Academy (Joshua Reynolds and Sir Thomas Lawrence) had made their names as portrait painters. Owing to a lack of patrons willing to commission history paintings, by the early 19th century history painting in England was in serious decline.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{theoretical}} and empirical model is developed for analysing the decisions of individual farmers {{whether or not to}} produce wildlife <b>and</b> <b>landscape</b> services, how much of these services to produce and form an environmental co-operative in order to reduce transaction costs or to build up bargaining power. The model is applied for Dutch dairy farmers as the main users of agricultural land in the Netherlands. Simulations show that the reduction of transaction costs makes it attractive for farmers to form an environmental cooperative in case of a fixed price for wildlife <b>and</b> <b>landscape</b> services. Therefore more wildlife <b>and</b> <b>landscape</b> services are produced and more farmers are involved compared to a situation with individual supply. If demand is no longer perfectly elastic an increase in wildlife <b>and</b> <b>landscape</b> services production leads to lower prices offsetting part of the production and profit increase caused by lower transaction costs. However, if the environmental co-operative acts like a monopolist its bargaining position leads to a decrease in the production of wildlife <b>and</b> <b>landscape</b> services <b>and</b> higher prices. wildlife <b>and</b> <b>landscape</b> management, micro-econometrics, transaction costs, co-operation, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R
