40|$|Summary A cohort {{comprising}} 11 678 {{women who}} had undergone cholecystectomy in the period 1964 through 1967 for a benign gallbladder disease was investigated. They represented almost a total ascertainment from a defined geographic area. Follow-up during 11 - 14 completed years of observation revealed a total of 202 breast cancer cases after the cholecystectomy. This number {{was close to the}} expected incidence of 199. 1 (relative risk 1. 0). Further analysis of the risk in relation to duration of observation and age at operation did not reveal any trend or subgroup with a significantly increased or decreased risk. It was concluded that despite the many epidemiologic observations indicating that in Western Countries dietary habits are particularly important determinants of the high incidence of both gallstone disease and breast cancer, our results contradict the idea that the diseases share common <b>aetiologic</b> <b>factors.</b> Certain epidemiological data suggest that breast cancer and gallstone disease have major <b>aetiologic</b> <b>factors</b> in common.

40|$|Background: No recent national-level {{data on the}} {{aetiology}} {{of chronic}} hepatitis are available in Italy. Aim: To evaluate the current aetiology of chronic hepatitis in Italy. Patients: A total of 6210 chronic hepatitis patients (both prevalence and incident cases) consecutively admitted to 79 hospitals located throughout Italy were enrolled over a 6 -month period in 2001. The hospitals were randomly selected through systematic cluster sampling. Results: The main agent associated with chronic hepatitis was hepatitis C virus, which was found in 76. 5 % of the patients (in 62. 6 % {{it was the only}} <b>aetiologic</b> <b>factor).</b> Hepatitis B surface antigen was present in the serum of 12. 2 % of the cases (in 9. 2 % it was the only <b>aetiologic</b> <b>factor).</b> Hepatitis B e antigen and hepatitis Delta were detected in 16. 6 % and 7. 0 %, respectively, of hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients. A history of alcohol abuse was found in 19. 2 % of the cases (5. 5 % without viral infection). Autoimmune hepatitis and inborn metabolic disorders were extremely rare. The prevalence of hepatitis C virus-related cases was significantly lower in incident cases, compared to prevalent cases (55. 1 % versus 65. 0 %; p < 0. 01). The mean alanine aminotransferase level was significantly higher in hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients, compared to hepatitis B surface antigen-negative patients. The histology was less severe in non-viral-related cases. Conclusions: Hepatitis C virus is the most important pathogenic factor for chronic hepatitis in Italy; however, the comparison between prevalent and incident cases suggests that this infection will play a less important role in the future. A comparison with previous reports shows that both hepatitis B virus-related and hepatitis Delta virus-related cases are decreasing. © 2004 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S. r. l.

40|$|AIM: To present {{two cases}} of {{external}} cervical resorption (ECR) on maxillary incisors, {{in which the}} primary <b>aetiologic</b> <b>factor</b> is suggested to be pressure trauma by frequently playing wind instruments. SUMMARY: The exact aetiological spectrum of ECR is still poorly understood. For resorption to occur, a defect in the cementum layer (trigger) is a likely prerequisite. Whilst the mechanism for continuation (stimulus) is still unclear, knowledge of potential predisposing factors is important in assessing patients at risk. Pressure generated by playing wind instruments could present an aetiological factor in ECR because it affects the cervical region of the root surface. The cases that are presented may confirm this hypothesis {{and the extent of}} resorption defects is shown by cone-beam computer tomography (CT) and micro-focus CT imaging techniques. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Ageing {{causes a}} decline in the {{function}} of human skin, while factors such as medical conditions, drugs and environmental irritants add to the compromised skin and predispose it to certain conditions. Superimposed on the changes of physiological ageing are changes characterised by chronic sun exposure. Skin neoplasia, whether benign, premalignant or malignant, is more common in the elderly. It is important to identify benign conditions, as it is crucial that lesions with a malignant potential be recognised so that timeous treatment can prevent serious malignancies. Ultraviolet radiation is the major <b>aetiologic</b> <b>factor</b> for the development of skin cancer. Pruritic conditions result from a combination of a declining barrier function and the effects of environmental irritants. Pruritus due to scabies is common in institutionalised older persons.

It is a quantity that will yield the predictive value of a test to predict presence of a specified disease in situations for which no proper gold standard is available.

We also considered the HLA B 27 antigen, the serum immunoglobulin A levels, the disease activity, the existence of peripheral arthritis, the ESR, the CRP values and the intake of drugs at the time of study.
