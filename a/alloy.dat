5|$|A mercury–thallium <b>alloy,</b> {{which forms}} a {{eutectic}} at 8.5% thallium, {{is reported to}} freeze at−60°C, some 20°C below the freezing point of mercury. This <b>alloy</b> is used in thermometers and low-temperature switches. In organic synthesis, thallium(III) salts, as thallium trinitrate or triacetate, are useful reagents for performing different transformations in aromatics, ketones and olefins, among others. Thallium is a constituent of the <b>alloy</b> in the anode plates of magnesium seawater batteries. Soluble thallium salts are added to gold plating baths {{to increase the speed}} of plating and to reduce grain size within the gold layer.|$|E
5|$|From 1889 to 1960, {{the meter}} {{was defined as}} the length of a platinum-iridium (90:10) <b>alloy</b> bar, known as the International Prototype Meter bar.

5|$|Mild steel corrodes {{more readily}} than wrought iron, but is cheaper and more widely available. Carbon steel {{contains}} 2.0% carbon or less, with small amounts of manganese, sulfur, phosphorus, and silicon. <b>Alloy</b> steels contain varying amounts of carbon {{as well as other}} metals, such as chromium, vanadium, molybdenum, nickel, tungsten, etc. Their <b>alloy</b> content raises their cost, and so they are usually only employed for specialist uses. One common <b>alloy</b> steel, though, is stainless steel. Recent developments in ferrous metallurgy have produced a growing range of microalloyed steels, also termed 'HSLA' or high-strength, low <b>alloy</b> steels, containing tiny additions to produce high strengths and often spectacular toughness at minimal cost.|$|E

Low <b>alloy</b> steel is alloyed with other elements, usually molybdenum, manganese, chromium, or nickel, in amounts of up to 10% by weight to improve the hardenability of thick sections. High strength low <b>alloy</b> steel has small additions (usually < 2% by weight) of other elements, typically 1.5% manganese, to provide additional strength for a modest price increase.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} design {{was a simple}} solid plug filled with a slug of low-melting-point <b>alloy.</b> When this melts, it first melts as a narrow channel through the plug. Steam and water immediately begins to escape through this. The cored fusible plug {{was developed in the}} 1860s to give a wide opening as soon as the <b>alloy</b> softens. This version has a solid brass or bronze centre, soldered into place by a layer of the low-melting-point <b>alloy.</b> When overheated, the plug does not release any steam or water until the <b>alloy</b> melts sufficiently to release the centre plug. The plug now fails dramatically, opening its entire bore immediately. This full-bore jet is then more likely to be noticed.|$|E
