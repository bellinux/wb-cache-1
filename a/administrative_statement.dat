40|$|This project first {{consists}} in {{an inventory of}} closed and abandoned mining waste facilities located on the whole French territory. All the data collected are then used for a risk classification step. The French territory {{is characterized by a}} rich mining history and a great diversity of its mining exploitations. It is now well known that some of these exploitations are potentially responsible for serious impact on human health and environment through soils and waters pollutions and/or failures due to physical instability of the mining waste deposits. In order to identify and to classify the mining sites which could cause a serious threat to human health, a first methodological approach was developed by GEODERIS on two French regions (Languedoc-Roussillon and Auvergne). At the same time the European Commission established the Directive on the management of waste from the extractive industries (Directive 2006 / 21 /EC). This directive, often referred as the 'Mining Waste Directive' (MWD), requires in Article 20 that 'Member States shall ensure that an inventory of closed waste facilities, including abandoned waste facilities which cause serious negative environmental impacts or have the potential of becoming in the medium or short term a serious threat to human health or the environment is drawn up and periodically updated [...] . '. In this context, the French Minister of Ecology has decided to start a project dealing with the aim of article 20 of the MWD. GEODERIS is in charge of this project and is assisted by BRGM and INERIS for the field investigations. The general approach adopted for this project first {{consists in}} an inventory of closed and abandoned mining waste facilities located on the whole French territory. These waste facilities are then gathered in geographical districts which are classified {{on the basis of the}} potential impact (environmental and sanitary impact) of their waste facilities. Inventory and classification protocols were developed and tested by GEODERIS. The inventory protocol is first based on a preselection step which produces a selection of mining sites/titles containing waste facilities that would be reasonably candidates for inclusion in the inventory. The preselection step is performed using the French mining database designed and updated by GEODERIS (BDSTM database). It uses simple criteria and parameters available in this database (<b>administrative</b> <b>statement</b> of the mining site, production data, main extracted substances, etc [...] .). All preselected sites/titles will not be necessary included in the final inventory. The second step of the inventory protocol concerns the data collection for the preselectioned mining sites/titles. The aim of this step is to identify and characterize by basic data the three compartments of the conceptual model : contamination sources - pathways and receptors. It's important to note here that this basic data collection is not a full risk assessment approach. The data collection is based on desk studies for the well documented mining sites/titles and on field studies for insufficiently documented mining sites/titles. In the present work, we have only considered mining waste deposits and leachates as contamination sources. These are characterized by basic data (volume, height, slope, grain size of waste, acid mine drainage [...] .) and are located on topographic maps in a digital environment. For sites/titles where a field study is required, samplings of mining waste and leachates are carried out. In some cases, in situ analyses are also carried out using an XRF analyzer (NITON). On the whole French territory the number of mining sites/titles to be visited for the step of data collection is estimated to about 600 (without coal mines). Until today, 330 mining sites/titles were visited. During this data collection step, some basic data are also collected on pathways (discharges of mining waste in a watercourse, dust generation, evidence of hydric erosion, thickness of the vadoze zone, site accessibility, vegetated cover, slope of the waste pile, etc.) and receptors (location of : population, livestock, recreational area, culture area, well for drinking water or livestock watering, etc.). All the data collected are then used for the risk classification step. According to the type of data collected in the inventory work we have decided to develop a classification protocol only based on simple evaluations without calculations (based on tables of classes and matrix of table combination). This protocol is based on the evaluation of a potential of toxicity for each contamination source, of a potential of transfer for pathways and of a level of stakes for the receptor compartment. The combination of these three parameters allows the calculation of hazard scores which are directly used for the final classification. Dans le cadre de l'article 20 de la Directive européenne 2006 / 21 /CE du Parlement européen et du Conseil du 15 mars 2006 concernant la gestion des Déchets de l'Industrie Extractive, le Ministère de l'écologie, du développement durable, des transports et du logement (MEDDTL) a confié à GEODERIS une mission d'inventaire des dépôts miniers situés sur le territoire national et liés aux exploitations minières fermées ou abandonnées. Après regroupement en secteurs des différents titres miniers comportant des dépôts, il a également été demandé à GEODERIS de classer ces secteurs en fonction du potentiel d'impact sanitaire et environnemental des dépôts qu'ils contiennent. Ce classement intègre à la fois un volet relatif à la stabilité géotechnique des dépôts et un volet relatif à la pollution des sols et des eaux susceptible d'être générée par ces dépôts. La démarche utilisée pour ce travail repose sur une méthodologie basée sur trois phases de travail : présélection des sites nécessitant un recueil d'information; recueil d'informations pour les sites présélectionnés; classification des sites. Les deux premières phases se rapportent directement au travail d'inventaire proprement dit. La dernière concerne le travail de classification sur lequel la présente publication a plus spécifiquement été axée. Pour les exploitations de charbon s. l (lignite, charbon s. s, anthracite), la démarche d'inventaire a été simplifiée dans la mesure où elle n'a été basée que sur la phase de recueil d'information (pas de phase de présélection). Les exploitations d'uranium n'ont pas été intégrées à cet inventaire, ces dernières s'inscrivant dans un contexte bien spécifique et traité indépendamment du travail présenté...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the latest}} market-based {{solutions}} to the rising costs and quality gaps in health care is pay for performance. Pay for performance {{is the use of}} financial incentives to promote the delivery of designated standards of care. It is an emerging movement in health insurance (initially in Britain and United States). Providers under this arrangement are rewarded for meeting pre-established targets for delivery of healthcare services. This is a fundamental change from fee for service payment. Also known as "P 4 P" or “value-based purchasing,” this payment model rewards physicians, hospitals, medical groups, and other healthcare providers for meeting certain performance measures for quality and efficiency. Disincentives, such as eliminating payments for negative consequences of care (medical errors) or increased costs, have also been proposed. In the developed nations, the rapidly aging population and rising health care costs have recently brought P 4 P to the forefront of health policy discussions. Pilot studies underway in several large healthcare systems have shown modest improvements in specific outcomes and increased efficiency, but no cost savings due to added <b>administrative</b> requirements. <b>Statements</b> by professional medical societies generally support incentive programs to increase the quality of health care, but express concern with the validity of quality indicators, patient and physician autonomy and privacy, and increased administrative burdens.

40|$|Effective geoconservation {{systems are}} crucial to the {{activities}} of subcommissions of the International Subcommission on Stratigraphy, such as the Jurassic Subcommission (ISJS). Fundamentally, the core activity of any Subcommission, the establishment of Global Stratotype Sections and Points (GSSPs) is a conservation activity in itself, involving the selection of key sites, to be maintained as references for subsequent consultation. Without adequate national site protection and management systems this fundamental function is liable to fail as the selected site remains vulnerable to loss and damage. In addition, strict conservation systems applied without adequate understanding {{of the needs of}} research and education can also prevent or significantly inhibit geological science and the use of sites such as GSSPs. To address these extreme scenarios and assist the development of a more scientific approach to conservation of geological sites of stratigraphical and palaeontological importance during dialogues with <b>administrative</b> authorities, a <b>Statement</b> defining categories of palaeontological heritage requiring protection and the basic requirements needed to achieve the conservation of stratotype localities is here proposed.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of a great shallow earthquake (M 8) in the Tokai region, central Honshu, {{in the near future}} was pointed out by Mogi in 1969 and by the Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Prediction (CCEP), Japan (1970). In 1978, the government enacted the Large-Scale Earthquake Countermeasures Law and began to set up intensified observations in this region for short-term prediction of the expected Tokai earthquake. In this paper, two serious issues are pointed out, which may contribute to catastrophic effects in connection with the Tokai earthquake: 1. The danger of black-and-white predictions: According to the scenario based on the Large-Scale Earthquake Countermeasures Law, if abnormal crustal changes are observed, the Earthquake Assessment Committee (EAC) will determine {{whether or not there is}} an imminent danger. The findings are reported to the Prime Minister who decides whether to issue an official warning <b>statement.</b> <b>Administrative</b> policy clearly stipulates the measures to be taken in response to such a warning, and because the law presupposes the ability to predict a large earthquake accurately, there are drastic measures appropriate to the situation. The Tokai region is a densely populated region with high social and economic activity, and it is traversed by several vital transportation arteries. When a warning statement is issued, all transportation is to be halted. The Tokyo capital region would be cut off from the Nagoya and Osaka regions, and there would be a great impact on all of Japan. I (the former chairman of EAC) maintained that in view of the variety and complexity of precursory phenomena, it was inadvisable to attempt a black-and-whit...|$|R
5000|$|The Community for Creative Non-Violence is a {{group based}} in Washington D.C. with a mission [...] "to ensure that {{the rights of the}} {{homeless}} and poor are not infringed upon and that every person has access to life's basic essentials -- food, shelter, clothing and medical care". Since 1978 the group served a Thanksgiving meal for the homeless in Washington D.C. By November 26, 1981 the group had changed locations of the gathering and ended up in Lafayette Park near the White House. The event gained media attention as the poor were eating a warm meal with 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in the background. In addition to the feast a few members set up ten tents {{in the form of a}} village. The group proclaimed “Welcome to Reaganville / Population growing daily / Reaganomics at work.” The name references the depression-era “Hoovervilles” that were camps of the homeless. The group stated they would try and continue the protest into the winter. The Park Police stated that the Thanksgiving dinner had a legal permit but that overnight sleeping would not be tolerated. The next day, November, 26th, police removed the homeless from the area. On November 30 the CCNV obtained a one-week renewable permit. This permit stated that:"(i)n connection with permitted demonstrations or special events, temporary structures ... shall be permitted” The permit however did not explicitly state sleeping may occur.On December 17, 1981 the CCNV appealed to the District Court for summary judgment for their complaint and for entry of a permanent injunction. The United States Government motioned to have the case dismissed which was subsequently denied. On December 23 the District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of CCNV and stated: “Plaintiffs are entitled to sleep in the nine (9) tents which plaintiffs have placed in Lafayette Park pursuant to a valid permit issued by defendants. Plaintiffs are not entitled to engage in [...] "camping activities," [...] such as the preparation or service of food in Lafayette Park” [...] The District Court stayed the judgment and injunction pending the Government's appeal to the Court of Appeals. The United States Government subsequently filed for appeal. The Appeals Court examined the National Park Service's <b>Administrative</b> Policy <b>Statement</b> that stated:“Camping is prohibited in all park areas except those specially designated as official campsites (36 C.F.R. 50.27). The National Park Service does permit the use of symbolic campsites reasonably related to First Amendment activities. However, camping primarily for living accommodation must be confined to designated campsites” The Appeals Court felt that the appellees were clearly engaged in political protest and therefore a “symbolic campsites” and that there was no evidence suggesting that the handful of tents in Lafayette Park was intended [...] "primarily for living accommodation."The Opinion of the Court concluded with:“For the foregoing reasons, we find it clear from the Record before us and from the National Park Service's <b>Administrative</b> Policy <b>Statement</b> that these protesters may lawfully sleep in their symbolic campsite. That conclusion necessarily follows from the National Park Service's interpretation of its own regulations. On this basis, the order of the District Court is Affirmed.” As a result of the court's decision, CCNV successfully staged its demonstration, including sleeping, for approximately seven weeks during the winter of that year. Sometime later the National Park Service revised its camping regulations for the National Capital Region. The new regulations stated:"when it reasonably appears, in light of all the circumstances, that the participants, in conducting these activities, are in fact using the area as a living accommodation regardless of the intent of the participants or the nature of any other activities in which they may also be engaging."CCNV planned to hold another demonstration the following winter and was to include 60 tents total with 20 tents in a quadrant of Lafayette Park and 40 tents on the National Mall The CCNV filed on September 7, 1982 for a permit. The National Park Service granted a permit [...] "to set up two symbolic campsites, one on the Mall with a maximum of one hundred participants and forty tents, and one in Lafayette Park with approximately fifty participants and twenty tents". The permit granted the ability to have a twenty-four-hour presence at the locations but did not allow the participants to sleep. The CCNV then sought a court order invalidating the permit's limitation on sleeping as an unconstitutional restriction on their freedom of expression. They argued that part of the core message the demonstrators wished to convey was that homeless people have no permanent place to sleep. The District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of the National Park Service. The Court ruled that:(1) CCNV's demonstration falls within the scope of the amended anti-camping regulations; (2) sleeping, within the context of CCNV's demonstration, falls outside the scope of the first amendment; and (3) even assuming first amendment scrutiny is required, the new anti-camping regulations are constitutional as applied to CCNV's proposed sleeping activities. The group appealed to the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals where their case was heard. The Appeals Court re-examined the three reasons the District Court did not grant the CCNV injunction. They agreed with the notion that the National Park Service's regulation fit the CCNV's demonstration. Concerning the claim that [...] "CCNV's demonstration, falls outside the scope of the first amendment" [...] the court wrote in the opinion:Indeed, we cannot understand how the government can deny the indicia of political expression that permeate CCNV's pointed use of the simple act of sleeping. The protestors choose to sleep, purposely across from the White House and Capitol grounds, in sparsely appointed tents which the Park Service has already designated as undeniably [...] "symbolic." [...] Their permit application states that this conduct is intended to send the same message as this court recognized was sent in CCNV's 1981-82 demonstration: that the problems of the homeless will not simply disappear into the night. In concern with the Lower Courts third assertion that the new anti-camping regulations are constitutional the Appeals Court wrote and summarized their ruling:In sum, the Park Service has failed to demonstrate that the government's interests will be furthered by keeping these putative protestors from the sleeping activity which is the sole point in dispute. We reverse, therefore, because the indiscriminate line the government seeks to draw against sleeping cannot pass first amendment muster. Accordingly, we grant CCNV the injunctive relief it seeks, enjoining the Park Service from prohibiting sleep at CCNV's demonstration.The ruling was subsequently challenged and taken to the Supreme Court.|$|R

The purposes of this study were to identify and rank the major competencies and attributes needed by beginning volunteer literacy tutors of English speaking adults and to develop a tutor self-assessment inventory based on these competencies and attributes. The method involved the identification of competencies and attributes found in the literature, the review of these competencies and attributes by a reviewer panel of 11 adult educators, and the rating of the competencies and attributes by a tutor panel of 48 volunteer literacy tutors of English speaking adults with a minimum of one year of tutoring experience. Fifty-two competency and attribute statements were identified and ranked. Competencies in the following areas were identified: (1) Reading Skills and Instructional Methods, (2) Assessment, and (3) Implementation of Instruction. Attributes in the following areas were identified: (1) Psychology of the Adult Learner, (2) Interpersonal Relationships, and (3) Personal and <b>Administrative</b> Responsibilities. The <b>statements</b> were ranked within each area by the means of the statement ratings by the tutor panel. The outcome of this study is a 41 item self-assessment inventory based on the set of competencies and attributes identified. The competencies and attributes retained in the inventory meet the following criteria: (1) The competency or attribute is one that can be taught or improved through additional training or information provided to the tutor; (2) the competency or attribute merits emphasis due to its importance; and/or (3) the competency received a rating of at least 3. 40 on the 5 point tutor rating scale. This inventory may be used (1) to provide a basis for developing pre-service or in-service tutor training activities and (2) to provide the tutor with an opportunity to assess his or her own tutoring knowledge and skill. Implications of the study are that during the pre-service training emphasis should be placed on developing the interpersonal skills and knowledge necessary for a sustained tutoring relationship. Therefore, the providing of continuing in-service opportunities for tutors based on individual tutor needs is essential...|$|R

The danger of nuclear power plants in the focal region: Although the {{possibility of}} the occurrence of a great shallow earthquake in the Tokai region was pointed out by CCEP in 1970, soon after, plans for construction of a nuclear power plant started in this region. Since 1976, Hamaoka nuclear power plants (Units 1 ∼ 4) have been operating near the center of the expected focal region of the great Tokai earthquake, and Unit 5 is under construction. This is quite a dangerous situation.|$|R
