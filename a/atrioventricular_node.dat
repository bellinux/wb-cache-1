5|$|The {{sinoatrial node}} {{is found in}} {{the upper part of the}} right atrium near to the {{junction}} with the superior vena cava. The electrical signal generated by the sinoatrial node travels through the right atrium in a radial way that is not completely understood. It travels to the left atrium via Bachmann's bundle, such that the muscles of the left and right atria contract together. The signal then travels to the <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>node.</b> This is found at the bottom of the right atrium in the atrioventricular septum—the boundary between the right atrium and the left ventricle. The septum is part of the cardiac skeleton, tissue within the heart that the electrical signal cannot pass through, which forces the signal to pass through the <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>node</b> only. The signal then travels along the bundle of His to left and right bundle branches through to the ventricles of the heart. In the ventricles the signal is carried by specialized tissue called the Purkinje fibers which then transmit the electric charge to the heart muscle.|$|E
5|$|Although Purkinje {{fibers and}} {{the bundle of}} His were {{discovered}} {{as early as the}} 19th century, their specific role in the electrical conduction system of the heart remained unknown until Sunao Tawara published his monograph, titled Das Reizleitungssystem des Säugetierherzens, in 1906. Tawara's discovery of the <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>node</b> prompted Arthur Keith and Martin Flack to look for similar structures in the heart, leading to their discovery of the sinoatrial node several months later. These structures form the anatomical basis of the electrocardiogram, whose inventor, Willem Einthoven, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 1924.|$|E
5|$|The heart pumps blood with {{a rhythm}} {{determined}} {{by a group of}} pacemaking cells in the sinoatrial node. These generate a current that causes contraction of the heart, traveling through the <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>node</b> and along the conduction system of the heart. The heart receives blood low in oxygen from the systemic circulation, which enters the right atrium from the superior and inferior venae cavae and passes to the right ventricle. From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation, through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation−where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide. The heart beats at a resting rate close to 72 beats per minute. Exercise temporarily increases the rate, but lowers resting heart rate in the long term, and is good for heart health.|$|E
40|$|There {{are reports}} that in right atrial {{isomerism}} the conduction system has paired sinus <b>nodes</b> and paired <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>nodes.</b> Electrophysiological studies were performed in two patients with right atrial isomerism. One patient had a delta wave on the surface electrocardiogram without tachycardia attacks. The other, {{who did not have}} manifest pre-excitation, had recurrent narrow QRS tachycardia. Electrophysiological studies suggested the presence of dual <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>nodes.</b> Only unidirectional <b>atrioventricular</b> or ventriculoatrial conduction was demonstrated for these dual <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>nodes</b> even after infusion of isoprenaline. It is suggested that unidirectional conduction may be a common property of the dual <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>nodes</b> in right atrial isomerism and that the absence of retrograde ventriculoatrial conduction protects the patients against tachycardia...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} the ultrastructural {{changes in the}} sinuatrial and <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>nodes</b> of {{the heart of the}} monkey (Macaca fascicularis) after right cervical sympathectomy. Obvious changes in the nodal cells were seen one day after operation. Numerous glycogen particles grouped together to form electron-dense patches containing vacuoles in the cytoplasm. At three days after operation, intracellular organelles exhibited fragmentation and dissolution. By five and seven days after operation, the affected cells were vacuolated and some were swollen and appeared to have degenerated. Simultaneously, there was massive infiltration of macrophages were present nodal tissues. Axon profiles and terminals showing various degrees of degeneration were present {{in the vicinity of the}} nodal cells throughout the period of study. It is concluded that right cervical sympathectomy resulted in a rapid degeneration in some of the cells in the sinuatrial and <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>nodes...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Verapamil's {{mechanism}} {{in all cases}} is to block voltage-dependent calcium channels. [...] In cardiac pharmacology, calcium channel blockers are considered class-IV antiarrhythmic agents. Since calcium channels are especially concentrated in the sinoatrial and <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>nodes,</b> these agents {{can be used to}} decrease impulse conduction through the AV node, thus protecting the ventricles from atrial tachyarrhythmias.|$|R
25|$|SCN5A {{is mainly}} {{expressed}} in the heart, where expression is abundant in working myocardium and conduction tissue. In contrast, expression is low in the sinoatrial node and <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>node.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{inhibition}} of the sodium pump may also improve baroreceptor sensitivity in HF and may {{explain some of}} the neurohormonal effects of digoxin. Digoxin also has important parasympathetic effects, particularly on the <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>node.</b>|$|E
25|$|In cardiac uses, {{it works}} as a nonselective muscarinic acetylcholinergic antagonist, {{increasing}} firing of the sinoatrial node (SA) and conduction through the <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>node</b> (AV) of the heart, opposes {{the actions of the}} vagus nerve, blocks acetylcholine receptor sites, and decreases bronchial secretions.|$|E
50|$|Methoctramine is a polymethylene tetraamine {{that acts}} as a muscarinic antagonist. It preferently binds to the pre-synaptic {{receptor}} M2, a muscarinic acetylcholine ganglionic protein complex present basically in heart cells. In normal conditions -absence of methoctramine-, the activation of M2 receptors diminishes the speed of conduction of the sinoatrial and <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>nodes</b> thus reducing the heart rate. Thanks to its apparently high cardioselectivity, it has been studied as a potential parasymphatolitic drug, particularly against bradycardia. However, currently it’s only addressed for research purposes, since the administration to humans is still unavailable.|$|R
50|$|The {{causes of}} cardiac arrhythmias are numerous, from {{structural}} {{changes in the}} conduction system (the sinoatrial and <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>nodes,</b> or His-Purkinje system) and cardiac muscle, to mutations in genes coding for ion channels of the heart. Movement of ions, particularly Na+, Ca2+ and K+, causes depolarizations of cell membranes in node cells, which are then transmitted to cardiac muscle cells to induce contraction. After depolarization, the ions are moved back to their original locations, leading to repolarization of the membrane and relaxation. Disruptions in ion flow affect the heart’s ability to contract by altering the resting membrane potential, affecting the cell’s ability to conduct or transmit an action potential (AP), or by affecting the rate or force of contraction.|$|R
5000|$|The SA node {{sends the}} {{depolarization}} wave to the <b>atrioventricular</b> (AV) <b>node</b> which—with about a 100 ms delay {{to let the}} atria finish contracting—then causes contraction in both ventricles, seen in the QRS wave. At the same time, the atria re-polarize and relax.|$|R
25|$|Sick sinus syndrome* is most {{commonly}} seen in female Miniature Schnauzers. It {{is characterized by}} sinoatrial node dysfunction and may include <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>node</b> disease and bundle branch block. Electrocardiogram findings include sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, sinoatrial heart block, and atrial tachycardia. The major clinical sign is fainting (syncope).|$|E
25|$|Expression of QSER1 is seen {{at levels}} lower than 50% in many tissues. However, notable {{expression}} {{is seen in}} skeletal muscle, the appendix, trigeminal ganglia, cerebellum peduncles, pons, spinal cord, ciliary ganglion, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, dorsal root ganglion, fetal liver, adrenal gland, ovary, uterus corpus, cardiac myocytes, the <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>node,</b> skin, pituitary gland, tongue, early erythroid progenitors, and tonsil.|$|E
25|$|The diving reflex {{is used in}} {{clinical}} practice {{as a means to}} treat supraventricular tachycardia. This {{is an example of a}} vagal maneuver, whereby the vagus nerve is stimulated in order to block the <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>node,</b> which interrupts the abnormal electrical circuit taking place in a supraventricular tachycardia. This is especially useful in infants in whom the diving reflex is well-preserved, allowing the valsalva maneuver or carotid sinus massage to be more appropriate.|$|E
50|$|In normal individuals, {{electrical}} {{activity in the}} heart is initiated in the sinoatrial (SA) node (located in the right atrium), propagates to the <b>atrioventricular</b> (AV) <b>node,</b> and then through the bundle of His to the ventricles of the heart. (See electrical conduction system of the heart).|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Two {{different}} methods to elucidate the dependent or independent {{nature of the}} autonomic nervous system influence on the sinoatrial and <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>nodes</b> are considered. ECG PP and PR intervals are extracted from 20 normal, young healthy subjects using a wavelet based technique. The first analysis technique focuses upon a supine to stand transition. This transient event serves to highlight the uncoupled nature of PP and PR interval duration for about five beats, suggesting an independent ANS drive to each node. Secondly, sections of quiet supine and standing data are analyzed. Parametric spectral analysis shows variable LF and HF component behavior across different subjects. The relative distribution of recovery RP intervals versus PR for supine and standing are clearly separate for 10 different subjects and borderline for 5. Large intersubject variation is evident...|$|R
40|$|Calcium (Ca++) {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in many cardiovascular physiologic processes. Electrophysiologic properties of the sinus and <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>nodes</b> greatly depend on Ca++ ion influx. Also, Ca++ is the main link for excitation-contraction coupling of the myocardium. Ca++ channel blockers are a group of heterogeneous compounds that block the ionic influx of Ca++ into the myocardial and vascular smooth muscle cells. Because Ca++ plays a central role, {{it is not surprising that}} Ca++ channel blockers can produce profound alterations in cardiovascular functions. Recently several studies have shown these agents to be useful in the treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, variant angina, chronic stable angina and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In the future they may be found useful in preserving myocardium during cardiopulmonary bypass, in limiting infarct size and in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure...|$|R
25|$|The <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>node</b> {{position}} {{differs from}} other fowl. It {{is located in}} the endocardium of the atrial surface of the right atrioventricular valve. It is not covered by connective tissue, which is characteristic of vertebrate heart anatomy. It also contains fewer myofibrils than usual myocardial cells. The AV node connects the atrial and ventricular chambers. It functions to carry the electrical impulse from the atria to the ventricle. Upon view, the myocardial cells are observed to have large densely packed chromosomes within the nucleus.|$|E
25|$|During each heartbeat, {{a healthy}} heart has an orderly {{progression}} of depolarization {{that starts with}} pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node, spreads out through the atrium, passes through the <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>node</b> down into the bundle of His and into the Purkinje fibers, spreading down {{and to the left}} throughout the ventricles. This orderly pattern of depolarization gives rise to the characteristic ECG tracing. To the trained clinician, an ECG conveys a large amount of information about the structure of the heart and the function of its electrical conduction system. Among other things, an ECG can be used to measure the rate and rhythm of heartbeats, the size and position of the heart chambers, the presence of any damage to the heart's muscle cells or conduction system, the effects of cardiac drugs, and the function of implanted pacemakers.|$|E
500|$|Heart tissue {{receives}} {{blood from}} two arteries which arise {{just above the}} aortic valve. These are the left main coronary artery and the right coronary artery. The left main coronary artery splits shortly after leaving the aorta into two vessels, the left anterior descending and the left circumflex artery. The left anterior descending artery supplies heart tissue and the front, outer side, and the septum of the left ventricle. It does this by branching into smaller arteries – diagonal and septal branches. The left circumflex supplies the back and underneath of the left ventricle. The right coronary artery supplies the right atrium, right ventricle, and lower posterior sections of the left ventricle. The right coronary artery also supplies blood to the <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>node</b> (in about 90% of people) and the sinoatrial node (in about 60% of people). The right coronary artery runs in a groove {{at the back of}} the heart and the left anterior descending artery runs in a groove at the front. There is significant variation between people in the anatomy of the arteries that supply the heart [...] The arteries divide at their furtherst reaches into smaller branches that join together at the edges of each arterial distribution.|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} {{clinical}} course and outcome of fetal sinus bradycardia (SB) due to maternal antibody-induced sinus node dysfunction. We reviewed the maternal, prenatal, and postnatal findings of fetuses with SB associated with elevated maternal anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La antibodies. Of the 6 cases diagnosed prenatally, 3 had isolated SB persisting after birth {{and had a}} good prognosis. Three fetuses with SB and severe myocardial involvement (congenital complete heart block and/or endocardial fibroelastosis) succumbed in utero in spite of treatment. Postmortem histopathology in 1 fetus showed inflammatory destruction of the sinus and <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>nodes.</b> SB was detected incidentally in a 7 -year-old girl. She had intermittent heart block with progressive sinus arrest requiring permanent pacemaker.

5|$|The {{vagus nerve}} is a long, {{wandering}} nerve {{that emerges from}} the brainstem and provides parasympathetic stimulation to {{a large number of}} organs in the thorax and abdomen, including the heart. The nerves from the sympathetic trunk emerge through the T1-T4 thoracic ganglia and travel to both the sinoatrial and <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>nodes,</b> {{as well as to the}} atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers. Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) at the neuromuscular junction of the cardiac nerves. This shortens the repolarization period, thus speeding the rate of depolarization and contraction, which results in an increased heart rate. It opens chemical or ligand-gated sodium and calcium ion channels, allowing an influx of positively charged ions. Norepinephrine binds to the beta–1 receptor.|$|R
2500|$|Fibrosis is {{not limited}} to the muscle mass of the atria and may occur in the sinus node (SA node) and <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>node</b> (AV node), {{correlating}} with sick sinus syndrome. [...] Prolonged episodes of atrial fibrillation have been shown to correlate with prolongation of the sinus node recovery time, suggesting that dysfunction of the SA node is progressive with prolonged episodes of atrial fibrillation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{heartbeat}} of a {{human embryo}} begins at approximately 21 days after conception, or five weeks after the last normal menstrual period (LMP), which is the date normally used to date pregnancy in the medical community.

The heartbeat is initiated in the pacemaker regions and spreads {{to the rest of}} the heart through a conduction pathway. Pacemaker cells develop in the primitive atrium and the sinus venosus to form the sinoatrial node and the <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>node</b> respectively. Conductive cells develop the bundle of His and carry the depolarization into the lower heart.|$|E
2500|$|The cardiac action {{potential}} {{plays an important}} role in coordinating the contraction of the heart. The cardiac cells of the sinoatrial node provide the pacemaker potential that synchronizes the heart. The {{action potential}}s of those cells propagate to and through the <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>node</b> (AV node), which is normally the only conduction pathway between the atria and the ventricles. Action potentials from the AV node travel through the bundle of His and thence to the Purkinje fibers. [...] Conversely, anomalies in the cardiac action potential—whether due to a congenital mutation or injury—can lead to human pathologies, especially arrhythmias. Several anti-arrhythmia drugs act on the cardiac action potential, such as quinidine, lidocaine, beta blockers, and verapamil.|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} {{complication of}} dual-chamber artificial pacemakers is 'pacemaker-mediated tachycardia' (PMT), {{a form of}} reentrant tachycardia. In PMT, the artificial pacemaker forms the anterograde (atrium to ventricle) limb of the circuit and the <b>atrioventricular</b> (AV) <b>node</b> forms the retrograde limb (ventricle to atrium) of the circuit.

2500|$|The {{primitive}} ventricle acts as initial pacemaker. But this pacemaker {{activity is}} actually {{made by a}} group of cells that derive from the sinoatrial right venous sinus. These cells form an ovoid [...] sinoatrial node (SAN), on the left venous valve.

2500|$|In {{patients}} with AF where rate control drugs are ineffective {{and it is}} not possible to restore sinus rhythm using cardioversion, non-pharmacological alternatives are available.

This [...] "ablate and pace" [...] technique has an important place in the treatment of AF< as it is the only reliably effective method for relieving the symptoms of the arrhythmia and can be used when other methods have failed (as they do in up to 50% of cases of persistent AF). Although this procedure results in a regular (paced) heart rhythm it does not prevent the atria from fibrillating and therefore long-term warfarin anticoagulation may still be required.|$|E
40|$|It is {{just over}} 100 years since details emerged of the {{anatomical}} {{arrangement of the}} histologically specialised cardiomyocytes responsible for initiation and propagation of the cardiac impulse.

40|$|Abstract. A {{discrete}} model {{based on a}} nonlinear difference equation (equivalent to a coupled map lattice of high dimension) is used to study the dynamics of a circulating pulse in a ring of excitable media, such as cardiac cells. Based on the global and local properties of mono-tonic restitution and dispersion curves, criteria are obtained for the asymptotic stability of the unique steady state (pulse circulating at constant frequency) {{as well as for}} non-convergent oscil-latory behavior of all non-equilibrium trajectories (pulse circulating at variable frequency). We also demonstrate that in certain cases the system is bistable, where an asymptotically stable equilibrium coexists with stable oscillatory solutions. 1 Introduction. The periodic contractions of muscles that result in the beating of our hearts are caused by elec-trochemical signals or excitations called action potentials that propagate through chains of cardiac cells. Normally, cardiac cells generate and conduct action potentials in response to excitation by the self-oscillatory pacemaker cells in the heart’s sinoatrial and <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>nodes.</b> However...|$|R
40|$|Published {{descriptions}} of the topography of cardiac ganglia in the human heart are limited and present conflicting results. This study was carried out to determine the distribution of cardiac ganglia in adult human hearts and to address these conflicts. Hearts obtained from autopsies and heart transplant procedures were sectioned, stained, and examined. Results indicate that the largest populations of cardiac ganglia are near the sinoatrial and <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>nodes.</b> Smaller collections of ganglia exist on the superior left atrial surface, the interatrial septum, and the atrial appendage-atrial junctions. Ganglia also exist {{at the base of}} the great vessels and the base of the ventricles. The right atrial free wall, atrial appendages, trunk of the great vessels, and most of the ventricular myocardium are devoid of cardiac ganglia.
