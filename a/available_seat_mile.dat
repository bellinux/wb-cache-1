5000|$|CASM ex-fuel = (Direct Operating Cost - Fuel Cost) / <b>Available</b> <b>Seat</b> <b>Mile</b> = ($3.929 billion - $1.527 billion) / 31.457 billion = 7.63 cents ...|$|E
50|$|The {{addition}} of 11 seats {{on each of}} the airline's 9 Boeing 717 aircraft would have reduced the airline's unit costs by increasing capacity 12.5%. Had the new seating configuration on the Boeing 717s been in effect in 2006, Midwest Airlines' cost per <b>available</b> <b>seat</b> <b>mile</b> excluding fuel of 7.22 cents would have been 6.77 cents, a 6.3% improvement.|$|E

50|$|Measure of {{unit cost}} {{in the airline}} industry. CASM is {{calculated}} by taking all of an airline’s operating expenses and dividing it {{by the total number}} of <b>available</b> <b>seat</b> <b>miles</b> produced.|$|R
5000|$|Also called [...] "unit revenue," [...] {{this figure}} is {{calculated}} by dividing the airline’s revenue by all the <b>available</b> <b>seat</b> <b>miles.</b> Different measures of revenue can be used—see PRASM and TRASM.|$|R
5000|$|For {{a simple}} {{example of the}} {{calculation}} of CASM, {{in the second quarter}} of 2011, Southwest Airlines (including its AirTran Airways subsidiary) had operating costs of $3.929 bn and 31.457 bn ASMs, as reflected in Southwest's SEC Form 10-Q for that period. Southwest's system CASM for the second quarter of 2011 was then: CASM = Direct Operating Cost / <b>Available</b> <b>Seat</b> <b>Mile</b> = $3.929 billion / 31.457 billion = 12.49 cents ...|$|E
50|$|However, retired Braniff Airways pilots Captain Jack Morton and Captain Glenn Shoop {{proposed}} {{launching a}} new Braniff that would operate {{on its own}} under the famed and well known Braniff moniker. The two pilots created a business plan that said the new carrier could operate Boeing 727-200 series trijets at 5 cents per <b>Available</b> <b>Seat</b> <b>Mile.</b> Initial offering of the prospectus drew little interest but Captain Shoop contacted Dallas businessman Bruce Leadbetter who contacted Hyatt Hotels Chairman Jay Pritzker. Mr. Pritzker {{was interested in the}} Morton/Shoop Braniff proposal and agreed to discuss a possible deal.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, airline {{carriers}} such as Midway Airlines and America West Airlines, which commenced operations after 1978, {{soon realized}} {{a cost of}} <b>available</b> <b>seat</b> <b>mile</b> (CASM) advantage {{in relation to the}} traditional and established, legacy airlines such as Trans World Airlines and American Airlines. Often this CASM advantage has been attributed solely to the lower labor costs of the newly hired and lower pay grade workers of new start-up carriers, such as ValuJet, Midway Airlines, and their like. However, these lower costs can also be attributed to the less complex aircraft fleets and route networks with which these new carriers began operations, in addition to their reduced labor costs.|$|E
25|$|Independent {{analysis}} for a 3,350nm transatlantic flight show the 787-9 has a slight {{advantage over the}} A330-900neo in cash cost per <b>available</b> <b>seat</b> <b>miles,</b> while the Airbus outperforms the Boeing once capital costs are included.|$|R
50|$|Often {{referred}} to as a measure of passenger “unit revenue”, it is calculated by dividing passenger revenue by <b>available</b> <b>seat</b> <b>miles.</b> Typically the measure is presented in terms of cents per mile. This measure is equivalent to the product of load factor and yield (see below).|$|R
5000|$|Revenue {{passenger}} miles can {{be considered}} the basic amount of [...] "production" [...] that an airline creates. The revenue passenger miles {{can be compared to}} the <b>available</b> <b>seat</b> <b>miles</b> over an airline's system to determine the overall passenger load factor. [...] These measurements can further be used to measure unit revenues and unit costs.|$|R
50|$|MetroJet {{operations}} did {{not improve}} US Airways's loss-making record. Many of MetroJet's passengers were cannibalized from other US Airways operations, such as its major presence at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Its aircraft were among the oldest and least fuel efficient in US Airways's fleet, and like its parent its labor costs were {{among the highest in}} the industry. Meanwhile, it faced cutthroat competition with Southwest, its main competitor at BWI. In an October 28, 2001 interview with Business Travel News, CEO David Siegel revealed that MetroJet's average cost per <b>available</b> <b>seat</b> <b>mile</b> was 8 cents, compared to 6 cents for Southwest and 10 cents for mainline US Airways.|$|E
5000|$|RASM is a {{commonly}} used measure of unit revenue for airlines, expressed in cents received for each <b>available</b> <b>seat</b> <b>mile</b> and determined by dividing various measures of operating revenue by Available Seat Miles. This number is frequently used {{to allow a}} comparison between different airlines or {{a comparison of the}} same airline across periods. In theory, the higher the RASM the more profitable the airline should be, assuming that the CASM remains constant. Various measures of revenue may be used. Passenger RASM (or PRASM) is passenger (or scheduled ticket) revenue per ASM. Operating RASM or Total RASM is the airline's total operating revenue per ASM.|$|E
5000|$|Available seat miles (ASM) or Available seat {{kilometres}} (ASK) [...] is {{a measure}} of an airline flight's passenger carrying capacity. It is equal to the number of seats available multiplied by the number of miles or kilometres flown. An <b>available</b> <b>seat</b> <b>mile</b> is the fundamental unit of production for a passenger-carrying airline. A unit in this case is one seat, available for sale, flown one mile. For example, an aircraft with 300 seats available for sale flying 1,000 statute miles would generate 300,000 ASMs for that particular flight. That the seats are available for sale is critical. An aircraft that had 300 seats but which was limited (for regulatory or technical reasons) to selling only 250 of them on a particular flight of 1,000 miles would generate 250,000 ASMs on that flight, not 300,000. Similarly, if passenger seats on a particular flight are dedicated to crew rest purposes, such seats would not be included in the calculation of ASMs for that flight.|$|E
50|$|Independent {{analysis}} for a 3,350 nm transatlantic flight show the 787-9 has a slight {{advantage over the}} A330-900neo in cash cost per <b>available</b> <b>seat</b> <b>miles,</b> while the Airbus outperforms the Boeing once capital costs are included. Teal Group's Richard Aboulafia opinion is the A330neo should dominate {{the low end of}} the twin aisles range/capacity because the 787-8, designed for 8,000-nm+, has the high operating economics and unit price associated.|$|R
50|$|Average seating {{configuration}} of an airline’s operating fleet. The measure is derived by dividing total <b>available</b> <b>seat</b> <b>miles</b> flown {{by the number}} of aircraft miles flown. It is important to understand the average aircraft size as it is an important determinant of employees needed to service the operation of a particular airline. Further, economies of scale generally mean that all other things being equal, an airline's CASM declines with increasing seat density (for instance, two small jet engines on a small commercial jet aircraft generally cost not much less to maintain than two large jet engines on a large commercial jet aircraft).|$|R
40|$|An {{operational}} {{and economic}} {{analysis was conducted}} on Greenlandair, a large helicopter commuter operation. Results indicate that the airline could realize {{a significant increase in}} <b>available</b> <b>seat</b> <b>miles</b> with a decrease in total cost by replacing the fleet of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft with Tiltrotors. The Tiltrotor can fly 2. 5 times faster than the helicopters, and 25 % faster than the presently used turboprop aicraft. Fuel consumption could be reduced by one half, and with additional savings on maintenance, crew costs, and ground support costs, plus expanded flight schedules, the airline could achieve a net yearly savings of over 2 million dollars...|$|R
40|$|Revenue {{management}} (RM) aims {{to maximize}} the revenue per available time-based inventory unit. For example, airlines seek to maximize revenue per <b>available</b> <b>seat</b> <b>mile,</b> hotels focus on their revenue per available room night, and performing arts centers aim {{to maximize the}}ir revenue per available seat performance. Implicit {{in all of these}} defini-tions are the concepts of revenue, space, and time. In this article, we focus on the time element of RM. Although time can be sold explicitly to the consumer in minutes, hours, or days (e. g., a thirty-minute spa treatment or a three-night stay in a hotel), the time element of a ser-vice is often implicit or open ended. When time is sold implicitly by proxy, the duration of customer use of the ser-vice is not set in advance (e. g., the length of a meal at a restaurant or of a gaming session in a casino). As time is no...|$|E
40|$|The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 {{provided}} {{the impetus for}} domestic U. S. airlines to establish hub-and-spoke networks to improve profitability and stem financial losses. This study seeks {{to determine if a}} significant relationship exists between an airline’s Hub Concentration and its total costs. Previous studies in the airline industry have focused on mergers, competition, profitability, and route network structure, but no study to date has focused solely on costs and Hub Concentration. Using the microeconomic principle of cost minimization, a cost function for airlines was developed. Furthermore, panel data for sixteen domestic U. S. airlines were collected from seven reputable sources on a quarterly basis from 1995 through 2011. Then, panel data regressions using random and fixed effects were used to analyze the data. This study finds that an increase in an airline’s Hub Concentration leads to a higher cost per <b>available</b> <b>seat</b> <b>mile,</b> a lower cost per passenger seat mile, and lower operating expenses. Even though many airlines that currently operate a hub-and-spoke network, such as American, United, Delta, and Frontier, have filed for bankruptcy in the last decade, this study shows that a more concentrated hub-and-spoke network is an effective way of reducing costs.

40|$|Leisure {{travel to}} the Caribbean is a key pillar of JetBlue's {{business}} model, with many customers flying to the region to enjoy paradise - like beaches and pristine waters. However, the ecosystems that support and provide those crystal - clear, turquoise - tinted seas are at risk. Some have already grossly deteriorated. Large - scale environmental degradation in the Caribbean is a risk to demand for leisure air {{travel to the}} area, thus impacting JetBlue. EcoEarnings: A Shore Thing seeks to quantify both the risk and return to JetBlue from the region's natural attractions. This study seeks to link the importance of clean, intact, and healthy beaches and shorelines to JetBlue's profitability in the Caribbean, {{with a focus on}} JetBlue and industry revenue per <b>available</b> <b>seat</b> <b>mile</b> (RASM). Our study began by observing a positive correlation between ecosystem health and RASM. The goal is to calculate the impact of the underlying drivers of ecosystem health [...] including water quality, mangrove quality, and waste along the shorelines [...] on industry RASM. We find positive correlations among water quality, mangrove health, limited waste on shorelines, and RASM, but more data is required to statistically prove and validate the model.

40|$|Re-imagining of {{the aerial}} {{transportation}} system {{has become increasingly}} important {{as the need for}} significant environmental and economic efficiency gains has become ever more prevalent. A number of studies have highlighted the benefits of the adoption of air to air refuelling within civil aviation. However, it also opens up the potential for increased flexibility in operations through smaller aircraft, shifting emphasis away from the traditional hub and spoke method of operation towards the more flexible Point to Point operations. It is proposed here that one technology can act as an enabler for the other, realising benefits that neither can realise as a standalone. The impact of an air-to-air refuelling enabled point to point system is discussed, and the affect on economic and environmental cost metrics relative to traditional operations evaluated. An idealised airport configuration study shows the difference in fuel burn for point to point networks to vary from - 23 % to 28 % from that of Hub and Spoke depending on the configuration. The sensitive natures of the concepts are further explored in a second study based on real airport configurations. The complex effect of the choice of a Point to Point or Hub and Spoke system on fuel burn, operating cost and revenue potential is highlighted. Fuel burn savings of 15 % can be experienced with AAR over traditional refuelling operations, with point to point networks increasing the <b>available</b> <b>seat</b> <b>miles</b> (by approximately 20 %) without a proportional increase in operating cost or fuel...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to explore the evolution of U. S. commercial domestic aircraft operations from 1991 to 2010 and describe the implications for future U. S. commercial domestic fleets. Using data collected from the U. S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics, we analyze 110 different aircraft types from 145 airlines operating U. S. commercial domestic service between 1991 and 2010. We classify the aircraft analyzed into four categories: turboprop, regional jet, narrow-body, and wide-body. Our study consists of three parts. First, we compare the four aircraft classes and explore trends in <b>available</b> <b>seat</b> <b>miles,</b> revenue passenger miles, load factor, aircraft departures, average stage length, aircraft utilization, seat capacity, daily departures per aircraft, aircraft ground time, and fuel burn. Second, we examine each of the aircraft classes in detail and provide insights on specific aircraft types. Finally, we compare product offerings from competing aircraft manufacturers in both the regional jet and narrow-body aircraft classes. The results indicate that more than 150 wide-body aircraft have been shifted from the U. S. commercial domestic market to international service while narrow-body stage lengths have increased 50 % over the 20 year period analyzed. In addition, the introduction of more than 1, 390 regional jets in the late 1990 s and 2000 s allowed airlines to expand hub operations and increase frequency on routes between major cities. A 10 % decline in the turboprop fleet coupled {{with the lack of}} turboprop replacement aircraft in the 30 to 50 -seat category suggest a potential for future reductions in air service to some smaller cities. Lastly, increasing fuel prices threaten the growth of the U. S. commercial domestic fleet in the upcoming decade and could potentially cause a significant number of aircraft to be no longer economically viable. by Alexander Andrew Wulz. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Post deregulation, many U. S. {{airlines}} created hubs with banked schedules, however, in {{the past}} decade these same airlines began to experiment with depeaking their schedules to reduce costs and improve operational performance. To date there has been little research that has investigated revenue and operational shifts associated with depeaked schedules; yet understanding the trade-offs among revenue, costs, and operational performance at a network level is critical before airlines will consider future depeaking and related congestion-management strategies. This study develops data cleaning and analysis methodologies based on publicly available data that are used to quantify airport-level and network-level revenue and operational changes associated with schedule depeaking. These methodologies are applied to six case studies of airline depeaking over the past decade. Results show that depeaking is associated with revenue per <b>available</b> <b>seat</b> <b>mile</b> (RASM) increasing slower {{than the rest of the}} network and the industry as a whole. Depeaking is associated with improved operations for both the depeaking airlines and competitors. Airports benefit from increases in non-aeronautical sales associated with connecting passengers spending more time in the terminal. The underlying reasons driving airlines' scheduling decisions during depeaking vary greatly by case. Results from the study provide insights for airlines that are considering depeaking and the airports which are affected. The results suggest that losses in RASM and no improvement in operations could potentially lead an airline to repeak, and that RASM is prone to fall when a strong competitive threat exists.

40|$|This report {{presents}} a preliminary {{design of a}} commercial jet transport that meets the criteria of the Request For Proposal presented by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronauts (AIAA). The proposal requires an innovative design of a low cost domestic commercial transport that will reduce operating costs for airline companies while still meeting present and future requirements of the Federal Aviation Regulations {{for this type of}} aircraft. Specifications for the design include a mixed class, 153 passenger aircraft, traveling a range of 3000 nm. The intent of the project is to identify factors that reduce cost and to design within the limits of these constraints. The project includes techniques or options that incorporate new technologies but do not override practicality, alternative design approaches, and a comparison between the new design and current aircraft in its class. The OFP- 6 M is an alternative design approach to the conventional commercial transport jet and is geared towards customer satisfaction through efficiency and reliability. The goals of the OFP- 6 M transport design are to provide original, sensible, and practical solutions by combining essential preliminary design factors with growing technology. The design focus of the OFP- 6 M reduces costs by simplifying systems where significant weight or maintenance savings can be achieved, and by integrating advanced technology for improved performance. Key aspects of the OFP- 6 M design are efficient use of materials like composites, and efficient advanced ducted high bypass turbofan engines. The high bypass engines lower fuel consumption and aid in reducing costs and meeting future noise emission restrictions. Composites are used for most structural components, including flooring and wing box. Although composites are an emerging technology and presently, a high maintenance material, they can be cost effective and an alternative to aluminum structures when correct manufacturing and design strategies are applied. Since, composites are lighter and require less manufacturing of complex parts, they can significantly reduce structural weight. Because of the large 17 ft. diameter, sophisticated aerodynamic considerations were implemented to significantly lower the drag. Supercritical airfoils were chosen with simple control surface design which allows for less maintenance and manufacturing costs. The interior configuration accommodates either all passenger, dual and single class flights or complete cargo. Also, a relaxed conventional stability is integrated with a stability augmentation system. As a result of these design implementations, the OFP- 6 M bottom line direct operating costs, compare favorably with the Boeing 737 and 757, at 3. 49 cents per <b>available</b> <b>seat</b> <b>mile</b> and costs are expected to reduce when improved manufacturing and maintenance methods are implemented...|$|E
