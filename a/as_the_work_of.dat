5|$|The {{design of}} Fort Tigné was mainly {{based on the}} Lunette d'Arçon, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Marc René, marquis de Montalembert. The final design by Antoine Étienne de Tousard {{resulted}} in a revolutionary fortification, which made {{it one of the}} oldest polygonal forts in the world.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from being}} the {{national}} capital, Copenhagen also serves as the cultural hub of Denmark and wider Scandinavia. Since the late 1990s, it has undergone a transformation from a modest Scandinavian capital into a metropolitan city of international appeal {{in the same league}} as Barcelona and Amsterdam. This is a result of huge investments in infrastructure and culture as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> successful new Danish architects, designers and chefs. Copenhagen Fashion Week, the largest fashion event in Northern Europe, takes place every year in February and August.|$|E
5|$|Beauchamp {{arrived in}} Frankfort on November 15, 1825. New Court partisans talked of Sharp's murder <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> the Old Court party, just as Beauchamp had hoped. One suspect was Waring, who had printed the handbills {{critical}} of Sharp. Known as a violent man, he had {{both political and}} personal motivation for the crime. He was cleared of suspicion when investigators learned that, {{at the time of}} the murder, Waring was in Fayette County recovering from unrelated injuries.|$|E

50|$|As for romantic valor (Hamasah), such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Mustafa Kamil (1908) and Wali Eddin Yakun (1921), {{it first}} {{appeared}} in journals. Other forms of literary genres such as sardonic narratives mixed with colloquialisms, <b>as</b> in <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Yaqub Sanu (1912) and Abdullah al-Nadim (1896), gained their socio-literary power from appearing in journals.|$|R
50|$|Cansinos was a polyglot; he {{translated}} The Arabian Nights into Spanish, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Dostoyevsky, and <b>the</b> complete <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Goethe and Shakespeare for {{the publisher}} Aguilar.|$|R
5|$|Due {{at least}} in part to the {{presence}} of the University of North Dakota, Grand Forks offers a variety of arts and cultural events. The North Dakota Museum of Art, on the UND campus, brings many nationally touring exhibits to Grand Forks as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> regional artists. In addition to the Museum of Art, UND offers other gallery space for student art. UND also has Theater Arts and Music departments. Students stage theater productions each year at the Burtness Theater on campus. UND's Chester Fritz Auditorium also brings music and theater events to Grand Forks, including national touring companies of Broadway musicals.|$|E
5|$|Humans had {{free will}} to ignore divine {{guidance}} {{and the behavior}} required by maat, but by doing so they could bring divine punishment upon themselves. A deity carried out this punishment using its ba, the force that manifested the god's power in the human world. Natural disasters and human ailments were seen <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> angry divine bas. Conversely, the gods could cure righteous people of illness or even extend their lifespans. Both these types of intervention were eventually represented by deities: Shed, who emerged in the New Kingdom to represent divine rescue from harm, and Petbe, an apotropaic god from the late eras of Egyptian history who was believed to avenge wrongdoing.|$|E
5|$|Suicide {{came to be}} {{regarded}} as a sin in Christian Europe and was condemned at the Council of Arles in 452 <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> the Devil. In the Middle Ages, the Church had drawn-out discussions as to when the desire for martyrdom was suicidal, {{as in the case of}} martyrs of Córdoba. Despite these disputes and occasional official rulings, Catholic doctrine was not entirely settled on the subject of suicide until the later 17th century. A criminal ordinance issued by Louis XIV of France in 1670 was extremely severe, even for the times: the dead person's body was drawn through the streets, face down, and then hung or thrown on a garbage heap. Additionally, all of the person's property was confiscated.|$|E
50|$|A list of {{the books}} of Jean and Jean Armand Dubourdieu, given <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> one author, is in Eugène and Émile Haag's La France Protestante.|$|R

25|$|A number <b>of</b> {{speculative}} fiction <b>works</b> {{present a}} dystheistic perspective, {{at least as}} far back <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> H. P. Lovecraft and Olaf Stapledon's influential philosophical short novel Star Maker.|$|R
5|$|The later German monuments {{constructed}} by the Nazi government were substantial, but communicated a limited range of symbolic messages, focusing on German heroism, conservative nationalism sentiments and masculinity. Use of mass graves symbolised the sense of German community. When Paul von Hindenburg died in 1935, the Tannenberg Memorial was then used as his mausoleum, commemorating elite military leadership during the war. The Nazi government attempted to have the Jewish names removed from the war memorials, but this proved impractical and instead a law was passed forbidding their addition to any future memorials. The government also removed more experimental earlier war memorials which were felt to communicate an inappropriate message about the war, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Ernst Barlach.|$|E
5|$|The name Book of Kells {{is derived}} from the Abbey of Kells in Kells, County Meath, which was its home for much of the medieval period. The manuscript's date and place of {{production}} {{have been the subject of}} considerable debate. Traditionally, the book was thought to have been created in the time of Columba, possibly even <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> his own hands. This tradition has long been discredited on paleographic and stylistic grounds: most evidence points to a composition date 800, long after St. Columba's death in 597. The proposed dating in the 9th century coincides with Viking raids on Iona, which began in 794 and eventually dispersed the monks and their holy relics into Ireland and Scotland. There is another tradition, with some traction among Irish scholars, that suggests the manuscript was created for the 200th anniversary of the saint's death.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{publication of}} Theory of Literature consists of twenty chapters set in five sections based on thematic similarities; one chapter and section was removed in later editions. Wellek contributed thirteen of the book's chapters, while Warren wrote six; {{the final chapter}} was written collaboratively. Although most of the chapters are credited <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> one man, the two often copyedited and proofread each other's work, at times inserting entire sentences or paragraphs. Each also suggested further references that the other could use in expanding his chapter.|$|E
50|$|As well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Compagnie Animotion, Hayli {{directed}} a solo show with Irish performer Mark Hanly in 2011. She has {{also worked with}} bands on their mis-en-scène and complicité.|$|R
50|$|Frances Molloy's No Mate for the Magpie, {{published}} in 1985, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Mary Dorcey and Evelyn Cordon, have {{been compared to}} the style of Girl on a Bicycle.|$|R
50|$|Detective dénouement {{was first}} popularised by the Sherlock Holmes novels, but {{is present in}} many stories, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Agatha Christie or in Ellen Raskin's young adult novel The Westing Game.|$|R
5|$|The upper {{portions}} of the Last Judgement panel are generally considered <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> a weaker painter with a less individual style. It is thought that van Eyck left the panels unfinished with completed underdrawings, and the area was finished by workshop members or by followers after he died. Maryan Ainsworth of the Metropolitan takes a different view. She highlights the close relationship known to have existed between contemporary workshops in the Low Countries and France, and speculates that a French miniaturist or illuminator, perhaps from the workshop of the Bedford Master, travelled to Bruges to assist van Eyck on the right hand panel.|$|E
5|$|Traherne was an inconsequential {{literary}} figure {{during his}} lifetime and his works were not known or appreciated until long after his death. As a country priest he led a devout, humble life and {{did not participate in}} literary circles. Only one of his works, Roman Forgeries (1673), was published in his lifetime. Christian Ethicks (1675) followed soon after his death, and later A Serious and Patheticall Contemplation of the Mercies of God (1699), which was published <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> an anonymous author whose character and background were discussed in a brief introduction by the publisher. From 1699 until the re-emergence of his work with Bertram Dobell's editions in 1903, Traherne's work fell into obscurity. If not for the chance discovery of an anonymous manuscript, his work and reputation might have been lost.|$|E
5|$|Amazing was published, {{with some}} interruptions, for almost eighty years, {{going through a}} half-dozen owners and many editors as it {{struggled}} to be profitable. Gernsback was forced into bankruptcy and {{lost control of the}} magazine in 1929, and by 1938 it was purchased by Ziff-Davis, who hired Raymond A. Palmer as editor. Palmer made the magazine successful though it was not regarded as a quality magazine within the science fiction community. In the late 1940s Amazing presented as fact stories about the Shaver Mystery, a lurid mythos that explained accidents and disaster <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> robots named deros, which led to dramatically increased circulation but widespread ridicule. Amazing switched to a digest size format in 1953, shortly {{before the end of the}} pulp-magazine era. It was sold to Sol Cohen's Universal Publishing Company in 1965, which filled it with reprinted stories but did not pay a reprint fee to the authors, creating a conflict with the newly formed Science Fiction Writers of America. Ted White took over as editor in 1969, eliminated the reprints and made the magazine respected again: Amazing was nominated for the prestigious Hugo award three times during his tenure in the 1970s. Several other owners attempted to create a modern incarnation of the magazine in the following decades, but publication was suspended after the March 2005 issue. A new incarnation appeared in July 2012 as an online magazine.|$|E
50|$|After {{conducting}} in Petrozavodsk and Saratov, he {{was assigned}} to the Yaroslavl Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra 1956-1964, performing symphonic cycles by Beethoven and Tchaikovsky alongside Soviet music such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Aram Khachaturian and Tikhon Khrennikov.|$|R
50|$|Direct social {{commentary}} via satire {{returned with a}} vengeance in the 16th century, when farcical texts such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> François Rabelais tackled more serious issues (and incurred the wrath of <b>the</b> crown <b>as</b> a result).|$|R
50|$|Bedros Magakyan {{founded a}} theater with actors of Armenian descent {{inspired}} by Europe and {{with permission from}} sultan Abdülmecid I. The theater was founded in 1857 and originally performed classical European plays such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Shakespeare.|$|R
5|$|For {{the period}} prior to Augustine's arrival in 597, Bede drew on earlier writers, {{including}} Solinus. He {{had access to}} two works of Eusebius: the Historia Ecclesiastica, and also the Chronicon, though he had neither in the original Greek; instead he had a Latin translation of the Historia, by Rufinus, and Saint Jerome's translation of the Chronicon. He also knew Orosius's Adversus Paganus, and Gregory of Tours' Historia Francorum, both Christian histories, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Eutropius, a pagan historian. He used Constantius's Life of Germanus {{as a source for}} Germanus's visits to Britain. Bede's account of the invasion of the Anglo-Saxons is drawn largely from Gildas's De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae. Bede would also have been familiar with more recent accounts such as Eddius Stephanus's Life of Wilfrid, and anonymous Lives of Gregory the Great and Cuthbert. He also drew on Josephus's Antiquities, and the works of Cassiodorus, and there was a copy of the Liber Pontificalis in Bede's monastery. Bede quotes from several classical authors, including Cicero, Plautus, and Terence, but he may have had access to their work via a Latin grammar rather than directly. However, it is clear he was familiar with the works of Virgil and with Pliny the Elder's Natural History, and his monastery also owned copies of the works of Dionysius Exiguus. He probably drew his account of St. Alban from a life of that saint which has not survived. He acknowledges two other lives of saints directly; one is a life of Fursa, and the other of St. Æthelburh; the latter no longer survives. He also had access to a life of Ceolfrith. Some of Bede's material came from oral traditions, including a description of the physical appearance of Paulinus of York, who had died nearly 90 years before Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica was written.|$|E
25|$|As well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> Ray Harryhausen (particularly Jason and the Argonauts), {{the team}} also took {{inspiration}} from Braveheart and Gladiator.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1700s, however, {{experts have}} {{increasingly}} {{come to see}} them <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>of</b> someone writing after Paul's death.|$|E
50|$|Following {{his time}} in Bamberg, Schneider went to Salzburg to {{continue}} and complete his studies. The Salzburg libraries gave him easier access to modern literary and philosophical <b>works,</b> such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> philosophers of the Enlightenment.|$|R
50|$|However, Emecé {{does not}} confine itself to <b>works</b> <b>of</b> fiction. It has {{published}} Papillon by Henri Charrière, Roots by Alex Haley, The Road Less Traveled by M. Scott Peck, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> <b>of</b> Leo Buscaglia and Jaime Barylko.|$|R
50|$|Booth's {{works were}} {{collected}} {{and published in}} three volumes, London, 1813, <b>as</b> <b>The</b> <b>Works</b> <b>of</b> Abraham Booth, excluding his writings on pædobaptism.
