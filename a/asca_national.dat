The primary focus of research was to determine what school counseling activities Latino/a students perceived as important and which school counseling activities Latino/a high school students perceived as satisfying. The researcher pursued this purpose through administration of a survey instrument developed by the researcher. The instrument consisted of 14 demographic items and 42 5 -point Likert scale items based on the domains described in the <b>ASCA’s</b> <b>national</b> model and current literature on experiences of Latino/a adolescents. The sample was comprised of 210 Latino/a high school students from five high schools in three school districts in the suburbs of a large Southwestern U. S. metroplex. The study population consisted of 94 female and 115 male participants ranging in age from 14 to 20 years old with the median age of 17. 54 years. Overall, students preferred school counseling activities focusing on college and career readiness. According to the results of this study, students indicated that although they believed college and career activities to be important, they were not satisfied with how their school counselors provided those activities.

40|$|Students, {{of all the}} {{educational}} stakeholders, are the last {{to have a voice}} in school reform efforts, yet their voices could hold substantial power in how to improve their success in school. Since school counselors are trained in how to engage students in confidential dialogue, school counselors are {{in the best position to}} participate in discussions with students around their perspectives on school reform efforts. The current major school reform effort is the implementation of the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). The main goal of the Common Core State Standards is to help prepare all students for college and career readiness. As recommended by the American School Counselor Association's (<b>ASCA's)</b> <b>National</b> Model, school counselors are encouraged to help students be successful in the three domains of academic, career, and personal/social development. It is utilizing these three domains, the themes, and the framework of the National Model that school counselors can align their programs to the CCSS and help their schools improve in preparing all students for college and career readiness. In order to begin aligning the school counseling program with the goals of the CCSS in the area of preparing students for college at Victoria High School, research was conducted using grounded theory and action research supported by Lewis and Winkelman's (2014) Participatory Inquiry Process (PIP) approach. The research was triangulated through reviewing academic transcripts, conducting student focus groups, and connecting the data to the literature.

40|$|The {{profession}} {{of school counseling}} has the charge of facilitating student success {{in the effort to}} break down barriers to achievement and opportunity toward college and career readiness. Leading professional associations such as the American School Counselor Association (<b>ASCA)</b> and the <b>National</b> Center for Transformed School Counseling strongly encourage counselor practice centered on leadership, advocacy, and accountability toward social justice centered practice, or school counselor social advocacy as defined by this study. This study assessed school counselor attitudes related to their belief in the importance, quality of support for, and level of actual engagement in school counselor social advocacy through the development of the School Counselor Social Advocacy Scale. Results of this study from a northeastern state with clear achievement disparities suggest that school counselors believe in the importance of social advocacy and are willing to engage in social advocacy behaviors even when support is moderate. Strong relationships exist between beliefs of importance and engagement as well as between support and engagement. A moderate relationship is clear between the quality of support a counselor feels and their belief in the importance of social advocacy suggesting the need for system wide shifts in practice and support. This study supports the need for development of operationalized models of practice in three phases as they relate to counselors; theoretical shift, cognitive process shift, and engagement in social advocacy practice...|$|R

In response, Campbell & Dahir (1997) consulted widely with school counselors at the elementary, middle, and high school levels and created the <b>ASCA</b> <b>National</b> Standards for School Counseling with three core domains (Academic, Career, Personal/Social), nine standards, and specific competencies and indicators for K-12 students.|$|E

With the advent of No Child Left Behind (NCLB, 2001) the role of the school counselor is beginning to change. In response to the challenges and pressures to implement standards-based educational programs, the American School Counselor Association released “The <b>ASCA</b> <b>National</b> Model: A Framework for School Counseling Programs” (ASCA, 2003). The <b>ASCA</b> <b>National</b> Model was designed with an increased focus on both accountability and the use of data to make decisions and to increase student achievement. It is intended to ensure that all students are served by the school counseling program by using student data to advocate for equity, to facilitate student improvement, and to provide strategies for closing the achievement gap. ^ The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the psychometric properties of an instrument designed to assess school districts 2 ̆ 7 readiness to implement the <b>ASCA</b> <b>National</b> Model. Data were gathered from 693 respondents of a web-based version of the <b>ASCA</b> <b>National</b> Model Readiness Self-Assessment Instrument. Confirmatory factor analysis did not support the structure of the 7 -factor model. Exploratory factor analysis produced a 3 -factor model which was supported by confirmatory factor analyses, after creating variable parcels within each of the three factors. Based on the item loadings within each factor, the factors were labeled in the following manner: factor one was labeled School Counselor Characteristics, factor two was labeled District Conditions and factor three was labeled School Counseling Program Supports. Cross-validation of this model with an independent data sample of 363 respondents to the ASCA Readiness Instrument provided additional evidence to support the three factor model. ^ The results of these analyses will be used to give school districts more concise score report information about necessary changes to support implementation of the <b>ASCA</b> <b>National</b> Model.
