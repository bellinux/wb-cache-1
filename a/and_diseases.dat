40|$|The {{objective}} of the research was to know the factors influencing farmers 2 ̆ 7 behavior in pest <b>and</b> <b>disease</b> control. Different control methods were practiced by farmers, such as resistant varieties, cultural techniques, biological control, and chemical control. In thisresearch, a survey method was used, total of farmer respondents were 60 people. Results of the research showed that factors influencing farmers 2 ̆ 7 behavior in pest <b>and</b> <b>disease</b> control were age, perception, and work motivation. The increasing age of the farmers resulted better behavior in pest <b>and</b> <b>disease</b> control. A better perception of farmers towards pest <b>and</b> <b>disease</b> control, resulted better behavior in pest <b>and</b> <b>disease</b> control. The increasing work motivation of farmers, resulted better behavior in pest <b>and</b> <b>disease</b> control. Therefore, agricultural extension methods had to be developed by Field Extension Workers to increase work motivation and perception of famers, especially through farmer groups.

5|$|Both {{farmers and}} {{scientists}} must continually {{draw on the}} irreplaceable resource of genetic diversity to ensure productive harvests. While genetic variability provides farmers with plants that have a higher resilience to pests <b>and</b> <b>diseases</b> and allows scientists access to a more diverse genome than {{can be found in}} highly selected crops. The breeding of monocultural crops steadily reduces genetic diversity as desirable traits are selected, and undesirable traits are removed. Farmers can increase within-crop diversity to some extent by planting mixtures of crop varieties; they can further increase in-field diversity by polycultural practices such as intercropping and companion planting.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{not being}} an {{agricultural}} weed in itself, it hosts {{a number of}} insects <b>and</b> <b>diseases,</b> including both pests and beneficial insects. It is also a potential reservoir of the cucumber mosaic virus, Erysiphum cichoraceum (the cucurbit powdery mildew) and Texas root rot. A study found V.thapsus hosts insects from 29 different families. Most of the pests found were western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), Lygus species such as the tarnished plant bug (L. lineolaris), and various spider mites from the family Tetranychidae. These make the plant a potential reservoir for overwintering pests.|$|E
5|$|Genes {{related to}} FLCN <b>and</b> <b>diseases</b> similar to BHD {{have been found}} in dogs, fruit flies, rats, and mice. In German Shepherd dogs, {{missense}} mutations in the canine ortholog of FLCN cause a similar phenotype to human BHD—kidney cancers (in this case, mutifocal renal cystadenocarcinoma) and skin tumors (nodular dermatofibrosis). They had a similar pattern of tumorigenesis to human BHD in that the skin lesions were heterozygous for the FLCN mutation and the renal tumors were likely caused by loss of heterozygosity. Female German shepherds with a FLCN mutation are also prone to uterine leiomyomas.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{diversity}} of crops {{can be used}} to help protect the environment. Crop varieties that are resistant to pests <b>and</b> <b>diseases</b> can reduce the need for application of harmfulpesticides.While crops that are more vigorous can better compete withweeds whichreduces the need for applyingherbicides. This is shown in a case study completed atAarhus Universityin Denmark which used more robust maize.Drought resistant plants can help save water and reduce the need forirrigation whiledeeper rooting varieties can help stabilize soils; and varieties that are more efficient in their use of nutrients require lessfertilizer.|$|E

5|$|VOC forces {{landed on}} 4–5 May on Trunajaya's right flank. Trunajaya {{did not expect}} an attack on this flank, and {{consequently}} it was only lightly defended. VOC took Ampel after little resistance. In the following days, the VOC established its battery in Ampel, simultaneously conducting desultory negotiations with Trunajaya. Trunajaya accused Speelman of being unknightly by attacking his right flank instead of his main position. Both Trunajaya and VOC moved their works forward until their artillery batteries faced each other at pistol-shot distance. Trunajaya dammed the river, the VOC's source of fresh water; afterwards, the VOC troops were limited to brackish water, <b>and</b> <b>diseases</b> soon spread.|$|E
5|$|Various {{causes for}} the {{dramatic}} decreases in population have been proposed, including predation, in particular by Eurasian sparrowhawks; electromagnetic radiation from mobile phones; <b>and</b> <b>diseases.</b> A shortage of nesting sites caused {{by changes in}} urban building design is probably a factor, and conservation organisations have encouraged the use of special nest boxes for sparrows. A primary cause of the decline {{seems to be an}} insufficient supply of insect food for nestling sparrows. Declines in insect populations result from an increase of monoculture crops, the heavy use of pesticides, the replacement of native plants in cities with introduced plants and parking areas, and possibly the introduction of unleaded petrol, which produces toxic compounds such as methyl nitrite.|$|E
