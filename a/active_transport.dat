5|$|Enzymes serve a {{wide variety}} of {{functions}} inside living organisms. They are indispensable for signal transduction and cell regulation, often via kinases and phosphatases. They also generate movement, with myosin hydrolyzing ATP to generate muscle contraction, and also transport cargo around the cell as part of the cytoskeleton. Other ATPases in the cell membrane are ion pumps involved in <b>active</b> <b>transport.</b> Enzymes are also involved in more exotic functions, such as luciferase generating light in fireflies. Viruses can also contain enzymes for infecting cells, such as the HIV integrase and reverse transcriptase, or for viral release from cells, like the influenza virus neuraminidase.|$|E

40|$|<b>Active</b> ion (NaCl) <b>transport</b> across {{isolated}} frog skin {{is discussed}} in relation to sodium and potassium composition and to O 2 consumption of skin. A distinction is made between processes in skin related to "unidirectional active ion transport" and processes related to "maintenance electrolyte equilibrium;" i. e., ionic composition of skin. Several metabolic inhibitors were found {{that could be used}} in separating maintenance electrolyte equilibrium from unidirectional <b>active</b> ion <b>transport.</b> Fluoroacetate (up to 1 x 10 – 2 M/liter) did not affect maintenance electrolyte equilibrium, but severely diminished the rate of <b>active</b> ion <b>transport.</b> This could also be accomplished with azide and diethyl malonate when 1 x 10 – 3 molar concentrations were used. When applied in higher concentrations, these two inhibitors, and several others, diminished <b>active</b> ion <b>transport,</b> but this was associated with changes in maintenance electrolyte equilibrium (gain of Na+ by and loss of K+ from skin). Similar observations were made when skins were subjected to K+-deficient media. Mersalyl and theophylline, in low concentrations, stimulated <b>active</b> ion <b>transport</b> without leading to changes in maintenance electrolyte equilibrium. Inhibition of <b>active</b> ion <b>transport</b> was found accompanied by decrease, increase, and unaltered over-all O 2 consumption, depending on the kind of chemical agent used. A provisional scheme of the mechanism of unidirectional <b>active</b> ion <b>transport</b> is proposed. It is conceived as a process of metabolically supported ion exchange adsorption, involving a carrier, forming complexes with K+ and Na+, a trigger, K+ ions, and two spatially separated metabolic pathways...|$|R

5|$|The plasma {{membrane}} is a phospholipid bilayer membrane {{that separates the}} cell from its environment and regulates the transport of molecules and signals {{into and out of}} the cell. Embedded in the membrane are proteins that perform the functions of the {{plasma membrane}}. The plasma membrane is not a fixed or rigid structure, the molecules that compose the membrane are capable of lateral movement. This movement and the multiple components of the membrane are why it is referred to as a fluid mosaic. Smaller molecules such as carbon dioxide, water, and oxygen can pass through the plasma membrane freely by diffusion or osmosis. Larger molecules needed by the cell are assisted by proteins through <b>active</b> <b>transport.</b>|$|E
25|$|Specialized transmembrane {{proteins}} {{recognize the}} substance and {{allow it to}} move across the membrane when it otherwise would not, either because the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane is impermeable to the substance moved or because the substance is moved against the direction of its concentration gradient. There are two forms of <b>active</b> <b>transport,</b> primary <b>active</b> <b>transport</b> and secondary <b>active</b> <b>transport.</b> In primary <b>active</b> <b>transport,</b> the proteins involved are pumps that normally use the chemical energy in the form of ATP. Secondary <b>active</b> <b>transport,</b> however, makes use of potential energy, which are usually derived through exploitation of an electrochemical gradient. This involves pore-forming proteins that form channels across the cell membrane. The difference between passive transport and <b>active</b> <b>transport</b> is <b>active</b> <b>transport</b> requires energy and moves substances against their respective concentration gradient, whereas passive transport requires no energy and moves substances in the direction of their respective concentration gradient.|$|E

In {{this study of}} perfused IMCDs microdissected from base (IMCD 1), middle (IMCD 2), or tip (IMCD 3) of the inner medulla, we tested whether furosemide diuresis alters <b>active</b> urea <b>transport.</b> Rats received furosemide (10 mg/d s. c. for 3 - 4 d) and were compared with pair-fed control rats. Furosemide significantly decreased urine osmolality and urea clearance, and increased blood urea nitrogen. IMCD 3 s from furosemide-treated rats had significantly lower rates of active urea secretion than IMCD 3 s from control rats. IMCD 2 s showed no <b>active</b> urea <b>transport</b> in control or furosemide-treated rats. IMCD 1 s from control rats had no <b>active</b> urea <b>transport,</b> but IMCD 1 s from furosemide-treated rats expressed significant rates of active urea reabsorption. In IMCD 1 s, this <b>active</b> urea reabsorptive <b>transport</b> process was inhibited by: (i) 0. 25 mM phloretin (bath); (ii) 1 mM ouabain (bath); and (iii) replacing bath Na+ with NMDG+; it was stimulated by 10 nM bumetanide (bath). In summary, we found that furosemide decreased active urea secretion in IMCD 3 s and induced active urea reabsorption in IMCD 1 s.

Whether fluxes across the tonoplast are active or passive depends upon the vacuolar potential which is unknown. Assuming no electropotential gradient, the tracer flux ratios are fairly close to those predicted for passive movement.

25|$|In {{secondary}} <b>active</b> <b>transport,</b> {{also known}} as coupled transport or co-transport, energy is used to transport molecules across a membrane; however, in contrast to primary <b>active</b> <b>transport,</b> {{there is no direct}} coupling of ATP; instead it relies upon the electrochemical potential difference created by pumping ions in/out of the cell. Permitting one ion or molecule to move down an electrochemical gradient, but possibly against the concentration gradient where it is more concentrated to that where it is less concentrated increases entropy and can serve as a source of energy for metabolism (e.g. in ATP synthase).|$|E
25|$|If {{substrate}} molecules {{are moving}} from areas of lower concentration to areas of higher concentration (i.e., {{in the opposite}} direction as, or against the concentration gradient), specific transmembrane carrier proteins are required.
