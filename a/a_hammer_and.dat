5|$|In 1995, Tomás Eloy Martínez {{published}} Santa Evita, a fictionalized work propounding {{many new}} {{stories about the}} escapades of the corpse. Allegations that her body was the object of inappropriate attentions are derived from his description of an 'emotional necrophilia' by embalmers, Coronel Koenig and his assistant Arancibia. Many primary and secondary references to his novel have inaccurately stated that her body had been defiled in some way resulting in the widespread belief in this myth. Also included are allegations that many wax copies had been made, that the corpse had been damaged with <b>a</b> <b>hammer,</b> <b>and</b> {{that one of the}} wax copies was the object of an officer's sexual attentions.|$|E

5|$|The {{national}} flag {{has been in}} use since June 7, 1995, one of two symbols adopted in the 1995 referendum. The main elements of the flag is a red and green bicolor, then decorated with an ornament pattern at the hoist position. The current flag is a modification of the 1951 flag used while the country was a republic of the Soviet Union. In the Soviet version, <b>a</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>and</b> sickle was placed near the top-hoist corner and the ornament colors were inverted. Several flags used by government officials and agencies {{were based on the}} {{national flag}}.|$|E
5|$|Before 1951, several {{different}} flags {{had been in}} use since the Revolution. The earliest flag was plain red, and was used in 1919 during {{the existence of the}} Lithuanian-Byelorussian SSR. After the formation of the Byelorussian SSR, the lettering ССРБ (SSRB) was added in gold to the top hoist. This design was established {{with the passage of the}} first Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR. It was later modified in the 1927 Constitution where the letters were changed to БССР (BSSR) but kept the overall design the same. This design was changed in 1937, when <b>a</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>and</b> sickle and red star were placed above the letters. The flag dimensions were also formally established as 1:2 for the first time. This flag remained in use until the adoption of the 1951 flag, which did away with the letters.|$|E
5|$|In {{the main}} event, Triple H faced Kevin Nash inside Hell in a Cell for the World Heavyweight Championship, with Mick Foley as the guest referee. During {{the start of}} the match, both men used a steel chair, <b>a</b> <b>hammer,</b> <b>and</b> the cell to their advantage. Eventually, Nash hit Triple H with a barbed wire bat many times before Triple H hit him with the steel steps. As Triple H brought a {{sledgehammer}} into the ring, Foley attempted to take it away from him, resulting in Triple H hitting Foley and Nash with a steel chair. Triple H followed up, Pedigreeing Nash. During this time, Foley had recuperated and was able to officiate the pinfall made by Triple H on Nash, thus Triple H retained the World Heavyweight Title.|$|E

5|$|Martin {{killed at}} least three people in Singapore and Thailand, and may have killed others in Belize, Mexico, and the United States. His modus operandi was to pose as a tourist and {{converse}} with another randomly chosen caucasian, either aboard their flights or while waiting at airports. He stayed in the same hotels as his victims in a room near theirs. Once he had an excuse {{to be in their}} rooms, he used an electroshock weapon to immobilise them before killing them by striking their heads with <b>a</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>and</b> cutting them up in their bathrooms. He chose caucasians as his victims because they were vacationing far away from their home countries, which made him less likely to be discovered. His motive apparently included money, as large amounts were withdrawn using the credit cards of Gerard Lowe and Timothy MacDowall.|$|E
5|$|The other {{national}} symbol that was chosen in the 1995 referendum {{was the national}} emblem. The elements of the emblem include a ribbon in {{the colors of the}} national flag, a map of Belarus, wheat ears and a red star. At the base of the ribbon, it says the country's official name in the Belarusian language. The emblem is an allusion to the one used by the Byelorussian SSR, designed by Ivan Dubasov in 1950. In the Soviet version, <b>a</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>and</b> sickle replaced the map of Belarus and the ribbon was all red. On the left and right ribbons, the Soviet motto Workers of the world, unite! appeared in the Belarusian and Russian languages.|$|E
5|$|During his lifetime, Kosygin {{received}} seven Orders and two Awards {{from the}} Soviet state. He was awarded two Hero of Socialist Labour (USSR); one being on his 60th birthday by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in 1964, {{on this occasion}} he was also awarded an Order of Lenin and <b>a</b> <b>Hammer</b> <b>and</b> Sickle Gold Medal.

In total, Kosygin was awarded six Orders of Lenin by the Soviet state, and one Order of the October Revolution and one Order of the Red Banner of Labour. During a state visit to Peru in the 1970s with Leonid Brezhnev and Andrei Gromyko, all three were awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of the Sun by President Francisco Morales Bermúdez. The Moscow State Textile University was named in his honour in 1981, in 1982 a bust to honour Kosygin was placed in Leningrad, present day Saint Petersburg.

5|$|Given a {{classical}} name for Japan, Fusō was {{built at the}} Samuda Brothers shipyard in Cubitt Town, London. Japanese sources universally give the date for Kongōs keel-laying as 24 September 1875the same as that for the awarding of the contractbut historian Hans Langerer describes this as improbable, arguing that no shipyard would order enough material to begin construction without cash in hand. Fusō was launched on 14 April 1877 when Ueno Ikuko, wife of the Japanese consul, cut the retaining rope with <b>a</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>and</b> chisel. Completed in January 1878, the ship sailed for Japan before 22 March {{under the command of}} a British captain and with a British crew because the IJN was not yet ready for such a long voyage. While transiting the Suez Canal, she was lightly damaged when she ran aground on 27 April. She received temporary repairs at a local dockyard and arrived in Yokohama on 11 June. She was classified as a second-class warship while still in transit. She was transferred to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 17 June for permanent repairs. On 10 July a formal ceremony was held in Yokohama for the receipt of the ship that was attended by the Meiji Emperor and many senior government officials. The ship was then opened for tours by the nobility, their families and invited guests for three days after the ceremony. Beginning on 14 July, the general public was allowed to tour the ship for a week.|$|E

While the village is at peace, they are unexpectedly attacked by Galbatorix's soldiers and the Ra'zac, the strangers who had killed Roran's father, Garrow. The village metalsmith, Horst, equips his sons along with Roran with equipment. Roran takes <b>a</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>and</b> attacks the soldiers. The Ra'zac {{and most of the}} soldiers escape, saying that they want information from Roran. The entire village then sets up defenses, and during a second invasion, the Ra'zac escape again. One night, Roran wakes up to find Katrina being attacked by the Ra'zac, who sneaked into the house. Roran then takes off the cloth around the Ra'zac's face and sees that they are monsters, not humans. A Ra'zac bites Roran, leaving a serious injury, and leave with Katrina captured.

5|$|On 24 January 2000, {{the part}} of the {{radiation}} therapy unit containing the radiation source was acquired by two scrap collectors, who claimed to have bought it from some strangers as scrap metal for resale. They took it home, planning to dismantle it later. On 1 February, the two, together with another two associates, attempted to dismantle the metal part (a 97-kilogram, 42-by-20-centimetre lead cylinder held in a stainless steel casing), which was the unit's source drawer. Using <b>a</b> <b>hammer</b> <b>and</b> chisel, they only managed to crack the welded seam. Two of the men then took the metal piece, along with other scrap metal, to a scrapyard on Soi Wat Mahawong in Phra Pradaeng District, Samut Prakan Province. There they asked a worker at the scrapyard to cut open the cylinder using an oxyacetylene torch. As the cylinder was cut open, two smaller cylindrical metal pieces, which had held the source capsule, fell out. The worker retrieved the two pieces and kept them in the scrapyard, but was unaware of the source capsule itself. The lead cylinder was returned to the scrap collectors for them to complete the disassembly.|$|E
