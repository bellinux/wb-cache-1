40|$|We seek to {{construct}} autonomous adaptive survivable systems that use <b>active</b> <b>trust</b> management to adapt {{their own behavior}} {{in the face of}} compromises in the computational environment. <b>Active</b> <b>trust</b> management maintains probabilistic trust models that indicate the trustworthiness of different resources for different tasks, and uses these models in rationally adapting allocations of computational resources to tasks. Flexible adaptation of allocations to changing circumstances places great demands on the methods used to represent the utility information needed by rational decision-making mechanisms. This paper explains how to use qualitative preference specifications to exercise effective control over quantitative trust-based resource allocation by facilitating convenient specification and adaptation of the stable foundations of the trust manager’s utility judgments...|$|E
30|$|<b>Active</b> <b>Trusted</b> {{computing}}. Traditional trust computing has two limitations. First, {{the core}} part of existing trusted computing model called Trusted Platform Module(TPM) is a passive chip intended {{to serve as}} a hardware root of trust for trusted infrastructure leading to software applications that are trusted. The TPM cannot actively initiate a trusted measurement, {{and it needs to be}} invoked by other compute units such as CPU. Therefore, once the computer has been compromised, the trusted measurement process is capable of being evaded. Second, although provably correct chains of trust from BIOS through several levels of operating systems is theoretically sound, the measurement technique used in conjunction with the TPM is vulnerable because it lacks of runtime changes detection methods. Here we introduce our <b>active</b> <b>trusted</b> model for computer devices, which can solve those two problems above. Our <b>active</b> <b>trusted</b> model consists of static trusted chain and dynamic trust chain. The static trusted measurement are performed when the computer is being started or a software application is being executed. For the integrity of the static trusted chain to remain intact, operating system kernel, modules, libraries and all the applications must be measured before its being executed. The dynamic trusted measurement is performed when the computer is running. It measures lots of factors such as the code segment and static data at the runtime. ASP is considered as the trust foundation of the <b>active</b> <b>trusted</b> model, and it can actively initiate a trusted measurement to establish the chain of trust that consists of multiple trust dependencies. Moreover, ASP can be used as the root of both static trusted chain and dynamic trusted chain.|$|R

National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Comprehensive Clinical Research Network (CCRN) funding and number of patients recruited to NIHR Clinical Research Network (CRN) portfolio studies for each NHS Trusts were used as markers of research activity. Patient-level data for adult non-elective admissions were extracted from the English Hospital Episode Statistics (2005 - 10). Risk-adjusted mortality associations between Trust structures, research activity and, clinical outcomes were investigated. Low mortality Trusts received greater levels of funding and recruited more patients adjusted for size of Trust (n = 35, 2, 349 £/bed [95 % CI 1, 855 - 2, 843], 5. 9 patients/bed [2. 7 - 9. 0]) than Trusts with expected (n = 63, 1, 110 £/bed, [864 - 1, 357] p< 0. 0001, 2. 6 patients/bed [1. 7 - 3. 5] p< 0. 0169) or, high (n = 42, 930 £/bed [683 - 1, 177] p = 0. 0001, 1. 8 patients/bed [1. 4 - 2. 1] p< 0. 0005) mortality rates.

40|$|Trust is a {{fundamental}} concept that enables cooperation and collaboration among the nodes in any network. Formal trust models are necessary for sharing information in a collaborative environment. Trust assessment methods that are commonly used in network applications or in social networks passively gather information about other nodes and take {{significant amount of time}} for assessing trust. Such models are not convenient for applications such as tactical airborne networks which are typically deployed for short durations of time. This paper presents an <b>active</b> <b>trust</b> model in which the nodes in a network proactively probe other nodes to assess their level of trust before sharing mission specific information. <b>Active</b> <b>trust</b> models are useful for assessing trust within short durations of time making them appropriate for airborne networks.

However, {{there is little evidence that}} online social marketing interventions can significantly influence behaviours, while there are few evidence-based guidelines to aid online intervention design. This thesis assesses the efficacy of online interventions suitable for social marketing applications, presents a model to integrate behavioural change research, and examines psychological principles that may aid the design of online behavioural change interventions. The primary research project used meta-analytical techniques to assess the impact of interventions targeting voluntary behaviours, and examined psychological design and adherence correlations. The study found that many online interventions demonstrated the capacity to help people achieve voluntary lifestyle changes. Compared to waitlist control conditions, the interventions demonstrated advantages, while compared to print materials they offered similar impacts, but with the advantages of lower costs and broader reach. A secondary research project surveyed users across an international public mobilization campaign and used structural equation modelling to assess the relationships between website credibility, <b>active</b> <b>trust,</b> and behavioural impacts. This study found that website credibility and <b>active</b> <b>trust</b> were factors in behavioural influence, while <b>active</b> <b>trust</b> mediated the effects of website credibility on behaviour. The two research projects demonstrated that online interventions can influence an individual’s offline behaviours. Effective interventions were primarily goal-orientated: they informed people about the consequences of their behaviour, encouraged them to set goals, offered skills-building support, and tracked their progress. People who received more exposure to interventions generally achieved greater behavioural outcomes. Many of these interventions could be incorporated into social marketing campaigns, and offer individually tailored support capable of scaling to massive public audiences. Communication theory was used to harmonize influence taxonomies and techniques; this proved to be an effective way to organize a diversity of persuasion, therapy, and behavioural change research.

40|$|This is a {{study of}} the {{relationship}} between trust in institutions and attitudes to gene technology in general, and GM food and stem cell research in particular. The role of so-called <b>active</b> <b>trust</b> is emphasised, meaning that trust is neither conceived as a trait nor a one-dimensional concept. The study uses data from a Eurobarometer survey of gene technology in Europe, conducted in 2002. People's attitudes in five European counties, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden and United Kingdom are compared, and the significance of trust in institutions in these countries is investigated. The results show that trust in institutions has an impact on attitudes to gene technology. Trust in experts, stakeholders and official bodies are associated with positive attitudes to GM food and stem cell research, whereas trust in Non-Governmental Organisations is associated with negative perceptions of these technologies.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the conceptual and empirical understanding of organizational trust. It confirms the importance of “contextual confidence ” in institutions for building trust. Moreover, it extends models of trust production to include the effects of purposive action by the truster {{over and above the}} contextual prediction of trust emphasized in previous research. Accordingly, “active trust development ” is conceptualized as a strategy to strengthen the basis for trust. Empirical evidence is drawn from a survey of 615 Hong Kong firms that manage operations in mainland China. Confidence in China’s institutional context was found to have a strong positive association with trust in the local staff working within that context. <b>Active</b> <b>trust</b> development was validated as a means of enhancing trust, though its effect on trust was not as strong as that of perceived institutional effectiveness. <b>Active</b> <b>trust</b> development initiatives are particularly valuable in an environment such as contemporary China, where the institutional foundations for trust remain underdeveloped.

40|$|Trust is {{valuable}} in facilitating social cooperation {{and is often}} thought to be helpful in the running of a complex modern welfare state. However, a number of sociologists, psychologists and political scientists have recently argued that trust in social institutions is in decline. One approach argues {{that the issue is}} compounded by a shift towards a more active and discriminating trust as part of a social transition towards a more reflexive society, and goes on to suggest that people often choose to place their <b>active</b> <b>trust</b> in non-state provision. This paper examines recent quantitative and qualitative evidence on trust in state and non-state pensions in the UK, as a context where current policy developments throw the general issues into sharp relief. It shows that patterns of trust in this setting can be understood in active terms, but that social divisions remain important in determining how <b>active</b> <b>trust</b> operates in practice. More vulnerable groups put their trust in the state, through lack of an alternative, while more confident and better-off groups tend to pursue investment strategies which they believe will give them more individual control over their money. Social divisions remain important during current social transitions, and often receive less attention than they merit in theoretical writing...|$|E

40|$|How can {{overseas}} headquarters actively {{build the}} trust of their local senior managers? Building on the theory of <b>active</b> <b>trust</b> development, this study examines the roles of three strategies-localization, communication, and control-and their combinations in building {{the trust of}} local senior managers in international joint ventures (IJVs). On {{the basis of a}} survey of 138 IJVs operating in China, localization, communication, and control are important drivers of the development of local senior managers' trust in overseas headquarters. Furthermore, the joint use of localization and communication represents a potent strategic combination for trust building. However, a localization strategy coupled with intense control hinders trust development. The findings provide important implications for foreign investors hoping to build the trust of local senior managers in uncertain environments such as China. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

30|$|The review dataset used in {{this paper}} is built upon Taobao review data. We {{selected}} Taobao as our target online marketplace based on two reasons. First, Chinese online marketplaces have been growing rapidly in recent years. Taobao is the leading platform with about 90 % market share. Its transaction volume is estimated to have more sales than Amazon and eBay combined in 2013 [38]. Taobao is well known among Chinese communities (half a billion registered users) and it is usually considered as a typical e-commerce sample in previous studies [39]. Second, despite the huge number of transactions, Chinese online marketplaces face serious reputation manipulation problem [5]. For example, some critics estimate that about 80 % of Taobao sellers have committed reputation manipulation activities during their businesses [40]. And {{it has been reported}} that over 1000 <b>active</b> <b>trust</b> fraud companies provide services to help sellers increase reputation and whitewash negative feedback [5]. But a recent official report shows that more than 70 % online buyers choose Taobao as their primary choice [41].
