50|$|An <b>Account</b> <b>Manager</b> is {{a person}} who works for a company and is {{responsible}} for the management of sales and relationships with particular customers. An <b>account</b> <b>manager</b> maintains the company's existing relationships with a client or group of clients, so that they will continue using the company for business. The <b>account</b> <b>manager</b> does not manage the daily running of the account itself. They manage the relationship with the client of the account(s) they are assigned to. Generally, a client will remain with one <b>account</b> <b>manager</b> throughout the duration of hiring the company. <b>Account</b> <b>managers</b> serve as the interface between the customer service and the sales team in a company. They are assigned a company's existing client accounts. The purpose of being assigned particular clients is to create long term relationships with the portfolio of assigned clients. The <b>account</b> <b>manager</b> serves to understand the customer's demands, plan how to meet these demands, and generate sales for the company as a result.|$|R

40|$|Acting in a {{boundary}} spanning role within their organisations, the key <b>account</b> <b>manager</b> in representing their customers’ needs internally {{is required to}} manage {{a wide range of}} complex internal relationships. This can often lead to incidents of conflict between the key <b>account</b> <b>manager</b> and other individuals or groups of individuals within the organisation in non-sales functions. Using the Critical Incident Technique (CIT), (Flanagan, 1954) together with an interpretive framework for data coding (Spiggle, 1994), this research investigates conflict and the key <b>account</b> <b>manager’s</b> internal selling role. This research also explores how the key <b>account</b> <b>manager</b> perceives intraorganisational, interpersonal conflicts and investigates the complex behavioural sequences adopted to manage them. In doing so this research addresses some of the shortcomings of the traditional view of the nature of organisational conflict and how it is managed while extending our understanding of the key <b>account</b> <b>manager’s</b> internal selling role. In contrast to the majority of research into personal selling, this research takes an interpretive approach through the analysis of transcripts from a series of CIT interviews with key <b>account</b> <b>managers</b> in the field. Twenty-nine key <b>account</b> <b>managers</b> from seven participating FMCG, Blue Chip organisations in the U. K. and U. S. participated in the research. From the CIT interviews conducted, 112 critical incidents were described with both positive and negative outcomes. This research provides further insight into the complexity of conflict, suggesting conflict is inherent within the key account management internal selling role, that incidents of conflict do not occur in isolation, that these conflict episodes are complex, having multiple components and that a combination of behaviours can be used in their management. In addressing these issues in the key account management context, this research further develops our knowledge of personal selling and the key <b>account</b> <b>manager’s</b> internal selling role by providing an analysis of the recollections of how conflict is perceived and managed by the key <b>account</b> <b>managers</b> involved.

5000|$|An {{original}} autograph of the {{two pieces}} was rediscovered in 1990 at the Eastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Philadelphia by Judith DiBona, an amateur pianist and <b>Accounting</b> <b>Manager</b> at Eastern’s sister school. Eugene K. Wolf at the University of Pennsylvania was contacted to identify and authenticate the manuscripts. He emerged with findings concerning the time of composition between {{the movements of the}} sonata and the fantasy, which were published in The Journal of Musicology in 1992. First, his findings further confirmed that the Fantasy and Sonata were written independently due to differences of stave spans, paper-types, and even ink color in between the two manuscripts. [...] Wolf also found differences in paper types between the first and third movements of the sonata and the second Adagio movement, which implies that the second movement was written down at a separate time {{from the rest of the}} sonata. He theorizes that the second movement was composed the earliest as an instructional piece for Thérèse von Trattner. Since the second movement is in rondo form and slower than the others, it could exist independently from the sonata more easily than the other movements.|$|E
