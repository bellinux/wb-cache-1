40|$|AbstractA content-free {{language}} {{is said to}} be weakly (w-) nonsingular if it is <b>accepted</b> by <b>a</b> nonsingular deterministic pushdown automaton in the sense of Oyamaguchi, Inagaki and Honda (1980).

Next, the class of super-nonsingular dpda's (which is a subclass of w-nonsingular dpda's) is introduced. It is decidable whether a dpda is super-nonsingular and whether <b>a</b> dpda <b>accepts</b> <b>a</b> super-nonsingular language. As a consequence, the problem of deciding whether <b>a</b> dpda <b>accepts</b> <b>an</b> LL(k) language reduces to the problem of deciding whether <b>a</b> super-nonsingular dpda <b>accepts</b> <b>an</b> LL(k) language...|$|R
