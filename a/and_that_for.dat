5|$|Divine command theory (also {{known as}} {{theological}} voluntarism) is a meta-ethical theory which proposes that an action's status as morally good {{is equivalent to}} whether it is commanded by God. The theory asserts that what is moral is determined by what God commands, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> a person to be moral is to follow his commands. Followers of both monotheistic and polytheistic religions in ancient and modern times have often accepted the importance of God's commands in establishing morality.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, she {{published}} The Divine King in England, {{in which}} she greatly extended on the theory, taking in an influence from Frazer's The Golden Bough, an anthropological book that made the claim that societies {{all over the world}} sacrificed their kings to the deities of nature. In her book, she claimed that this practice had continued into medieval England, <b>and</b> <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> instance, the death of William II was really a ritual sacrifice.|$|E

5|$|The {{daffodil}} and the leek {{are also}} symbols of Wales. The {{origins of the}} leek {{can be traced to}} the 16th century, while the daffodil became popular in the 19th century, encouraged by David Lloyd-George. This is attributed to confusion (or association) between the Welsh for leek, cenhinen, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> daffodil, cenhinen Bedr or St. Peter's leek. A report in 1916 gave preference to the leek, which has appeared on British pound coins.|$|E
5|$|British philosopher Richard Swinburne {{proposed}} {{a version of}} the Irenaean theodicy based on his libertarian view of free will, a view that one's free actions are not caused by any outside agent. He argued that, in order for people to make free moral decisions, they must be aware of the consequences of such decisions. Knowledge of these consequences must be based on experience—Swinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing that humans would question its reliability. Swinburne argued that humans must have first hand experience of natural evil {{in order to understand the}} consequences of moral evil <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> God to give humans moral free will, he must allow human suffering. Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal physical punishment, and argued that people who had chosen to reject God throughout their lives would continue to do so after death.|$|E

5|$|In the end, Emir Habibullah {{returned}} to his vacillating inactivity. He was aware the mission had found support within his council and had excited his volatile subjects. Four days after the draft treaty was signed, Habibullah called for a durbar, a grand meeting where a jihad {{was expected to be}} called. Instead, Habibullah reaffirmed his neutrality, explaining that the war's outcome was still unpredictable and that he stood for national unity. Throughout the spring of 1916, he continuously deflected the mission's overtures and gradually increased the stakes, demanding that India rise in revolution before he began his campaign. It was clear to Habibullah that for the treaty to hold any value, it required the Kaiser's signature, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> Germany to even attempt to honour the treaty, she would have to be in a strong position in the war. It was a good insurance policy for Habibullah.|$|E
5|$|Pinkerton, who in 1816 was the BFBS's {{representative}} in Moscow, had met that {{year with a}} community of Albanians in Vienna, then capital of the Austrian Empire. They assured him that a translation of the New Testament into Albanian was indeed possible. In {{a letter to his}} superiors at the BFBS, dated August 28, 1816, Pinkerton wrote that the Albanian nation occupied {{a large part of the}} ancient Illyria, that they spoke a language completely different from Slavic, Turkish, Greek, or Latin, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> the Albanian Orthodox the mass was recited in Greek, a language that believers and even some of the priests did not understand. According to Pinkerton, the translation could be done by one or more Albanians from the Ionian islands under the supervision of an Albanian bishop.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the noble gases aided {{in the development of}} a general understanding of atomic structure. In 1895, French chemist Henri Moissan attempted to form a reaction between fluorine, the most electronegative element, and argon, one of the noble gases, but failed. Scientists were unable to prepare compounds of argon until the end of the 20th century, but these attempts helped to develop new theories of atomic structure. Learning from these experiments, Danish physicist Niels Bohr proposed in 1913 that the electrons in atoms are arranged in shells surrounding the nucleus, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> all noble gases except helium the outermost shell always contains eight electrons. In 1916, Gilbert N. Lewis formulated the octet rule, which concluded an octet of electrons in the outer shell was the most stable arrangement for any atom; this arrangement caused them to be unreactive with other elements since they did not require any more electrons to complete their outer shell.|$|E
