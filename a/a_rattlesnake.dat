5|$|At birth, <b>a</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> {{hatchling}} {{has only}} a small button or 'primordial rattle' which is firmly attached {{to the tip of}} the tail. The first segment is added when the hatchling sheds its skin for the first time. A new section is added each time the skin is shed until a rattle is formed. The rattle grows as the snake ages but segments are also prone to breaking off and hence the length of a rattle is not a reliable indicator of the age of a snake.|$|E

25|$|These spiders are {{attractive}} but are normally very defensive and {{have one of}} the worst bites of all tarantula species, having been known to have a bite more painful than that of <b>a</b> <b>rattlesnake.</b> Although their venom may not kill a human, it is advised to avoid handling this species.|$|E
25|$|The massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus) is <b>a</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> species {{found in}} midwestern North America from {{southern}} Ontario to northern Mexico, {{and parts of}} the United States in between. Three subspecies are currently recognized including the nominate subspecies described here. As with all rattlesnakes, it is a pit viper (and as with all pit vipers, it is venomous).|$|E
25|$|Burrowing owls often {{nest and}} roost in the burrows made by ground squirrels, a {{strategy}} also used by rattlesnakes. When threatened the owl retreats to the burrow and produces rattling and hissing sounds {{similar to that}} of <b>a</b> <b>rattlesnake.</b> The behavior is suggested to be an example of acoustic Batesian mimicry and has been observed to be an effective strategy against animals that are familiar with dangers posed by rattlesnakes.|$|E

25|$|As {{summarized}} in various stories, Lois {{was born to}} Sam and Ella Lane and grew up on their farm {{in the small town}} of Pittsdale. While Lois was a toddler, she encountered <b>a</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> in the woods near the Lane family farm. The snake was scared away by one of Kal-El's baby toys which had landed nearby in one of Jor-El's experimental rockets. At the age of two, Lois suffered measles, and at the age of three, whooping cough. At an unspecified time during Lois' childhood, her younger sister Lucy Lane was born.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of Elephant Odyssey is the Fossil Portal, an artificial tar pit that periodically drains to reveal man-made Pleistocene-era bones. The path turns {{a corner and}} opens up at the Mammoth Passage Plaza, with exhibits for jaguars and African lions to the left, an exhibit that has housed two-toed sloths to the right, and {{the tip of the}} elephant exhibit, with a large wading pool, straight ahead. The path continues to the left along the pool, passing by the jaguar exhibit on the left. The northern end of the elephant pool drains into the Mixed Species Exhibit, which houses tapirs, capybaras, and guanacos. The path meets up with the elephant exhibit again before it reaches the Elephant Care Center, where visitors can watch keepers care for the animals. Next is an exhibit for secretarybirds with grasses, a tree and a statue of the extinct Daggett's eagle nearby. Afterwards, the path goes down a crevasse with a wall embedded with vivaria for dung beetles and diving beetles, among other aquatic insects. The path tunnels below the elephant exhibit to reach the other side, where it continues between the elephant exhibit and a creek for native reptiles and amphibians. Just past the source of the stream is a restaurant and gift shop, and after that is a couple of exhibits for pronghorns, horses, and camels. Next the path splits between a playground, <b>a</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> terrarium, and a California condor aviary with artificial rock spires and a stream. The paths then reunite and join the rest of the zoo.|$|E
500|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{modification of the}} snake scale is the rattle of rattlesnakes, {{such as those of}} the genera Crotalus and Sistrurus. The rattle is made up of a series of loosely linked, interlocking chambers that when shaken, vibrate against one another to create the warning signal of <b>a</b> <b>rattlesnake.</b> Only the bottom is firmly attached to the tip of the tail.|$|E

500|$|Dilophosaurus {{was also}} very {{different}} from its real-life counterpart, made significantly smaller to make sure audiences did not confuse it with the raptors. Its neck frill {{and its ability to}} spit venom are fictitious. Its vocal sounds were made by combining a swan, a hawk, a howler monkey, and <b>a</b> <b>rattlesnake.</b> The animatronic model, nicknamed [...] "Spitter" [...] by Stan Winston's team, was animated by the puppeteers sitting on a trench in the set floor, and used a paintball mechanism to spit the mixture of methacyl and K-Y Jelly that served as venom.|$|E
500|$|After his {{political}} career, Marshall became {{more interested in}} writing. He frequently contributed content to the state's newspapers and occasionally wrote poetry. He founded the American Republic, the only Federalist newspaper in the state, and published its first issue on June 26, 1810. Newspapers sympathetic to the Democratic-Republicans soon derided the American Republic as [...] "The Snake". Undaunted, Marshall added <b>a</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> and the inscription [...] "Tread Not On Me. For My Country." [...] to the paper's masthead. Marshall soon changed {{the name of the}} paper to the Harbinger, and eventually sold it to Patrick Darby in 1825. Darby immediately changed the name of the newspaper again, dubbing it the Constitutional Advocate.|$|E
500|$|On March 24, La Salle took 52men in fivecanoes {{to find a}} less exposed {{settlement}} site. They found Garcitas Creek, {{which had}} fresh water and fish, with good soil along its banks. They named it Rivière aux Boeufs for the nearby buffalo herds. The fort was constructed on a bluff overlooking the creek, 1.5leagues from its mouth. Twomen died, one of <b>a</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> bite and another from drowning while trying to fish. At night, the Karankawa would sometimes surround the camp and howl, but the soldiers could scare them away with a few gun shots. [...] The fort has sometimes {{been referred to as}} [...] "Fort St. Louis" [...] but that name was not used during the life of the settlement and appears to be a later invention.|$|E

500|$|In Help at Any Cost Szalavitz {{investigates the}} teen {{rehabilitation}} industry {{and focuses on}} four programs: Straight, Incorporated, {{a copy of the}} Straight Inc. program called KIDS of Bergen County, North Star wilderness boot camp, and the World Wide Association of Specialty Programs and Schools. Some of these programs cost parents over US$2,000 per month. She discusses the history of the troubled-teen industry and its origins in a controversial group founded in 1958 called Synanon. Synanon claimed that it could cure addiction to heroin, and its methodologies such as attack therapy, forced confessions, and imposed powerlessness spread throughout the United States. After <b>a</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> was placed in the mailbox of an attorney suing Synanon, the group's founder was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder. Synanon later went bankrupt, but Szalavitz maintains that it influenced organizations related to the troubled-teen industry.|$|E
500|$|Holmes's first novel, Elsie Venner, was {{published}} serially in the Atlantic beginning in December 1859. Originally entitled [...] "The Professor's Story", {{the novel is}} about a neurotic young woman whose mother was bitten by <b>a</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> while pregnant, making her daughter's personality half-woman, half-snake. The novel drew {{a wide range of}} comments, including praise from John Greenleaf Whittier and condemnation from church papers, which claimed the work a product of heresy. Also in December of that year, Holmes sent medication to the ailing writer Washington Irving after visiting him at his Sunnyside home in New York; Irving died only a few months later. The Massachusetts Historical Society posthumously awarded Irving an honorary membership at a tribute held on December 15, 1859. At the ceremony, Holmes presented an account of his meeting with Irving and a list of medical symptoms he had observed, despite the taboo of discussing health publicly.|$|E
500|$|During a briefing, {{early in}} the film, an officer states that a SEAL on a {{previous}} mission in the Afghan mountains was bitten by <b>a</b> <b>rattlesnake.</b> As the four-man SEAL team are fighting and withdrawing down a rocky slope, one of them encounters a large rattlesnake which is heard rattling before it is seen on screen. Rattlesnakes are found in almost every mainland country of the Americas, from Canada to Argentina, excluding Panama, Ecuador and Chile, {{but they do not}} occur outside the Americas. The venomous snakes encountered in the rocky valleys of the Pashtun region would be the Saw-scaled viper (Echis carinatus) and [...] the Levant viper (Macrovipera lebetina), with an outside chance of a rare Persian horned viper (Pseudocerastes persicus). The sound of the saw-scale viper rubbing its scales together as a defensive warning is not dissimilar to that made by a small rattlesnake vibrating its tail. It is likely that U.S. troops, upon hearing this sound, would automatically attribute it to the familiar rattlesnake from back home.|$|E

25|$|Like other rattlesnakes, C. molossus has a rattle {{composed}} of keratin {{on the end}} of its tail. Each time the snake sheds its skin, a new segment is added to the rattle. They can shed their skin several times a year, and the rattle is fairly fragile and can be broken, so the length of <b>a</b> <b>rattlesnake's</b> rattle is not an accurate measure of its age, unless the terminal button is intact.|$|R

500|$|The {{majority}} of the episode—like the rest of seasons six, seven, eight and nine—was filmed {{in and around the}} Los Angeles, California area. Before shooting the episode, Chris Carter reminded Patrick various times that he had to be in [...] "good shape". On the audio commentary, Patrick remembers being [...] "nervous" [...] for the shooting of the episode, since he was a big fan of The X-Files before becoming a part of the acting crew. The scene in which Walter Skinner tells Doggett that he himself witnessed Mulder being taken away aboard a UFO was filmed {{in the second part of}} Patrick's first night of production on the series; this scene also marked the first time that Patrick got to work with Pileggi. The ending of the episode, as well as a {{majority of}} its follow-up [...] "Without" [...] were filmed at Split Mountain in Anza-Borrego State Park. According to producer Paul Rabwin, an [...] "incredible heat wave" [...] hit the area during the shooting, resulting in terrible filming conditions. In the desert, the cast and crew were informed that there was a [...] "one in twenty-five" [...] chance that someone would be bit by <b>a</b> <b>rattlesnake.</b> Pileggi later joked that during the filming of his scenes all he could think about was stumbling upon a snake.|$|E
500|$|After her miscarriage, much of {{the hostility}} from the family evaporates, with the {{exception}} of J.R. He openly despises her and her brother. In 1979, Pam is told by Digger's doctor that Digger was a carrier of neurofibromatosis, and that she and Cliff, as his children, were carriers; as neurofibromatosis is a potentially fatal disease to infants. Ironically, Pam soon discovers she is pregnant again. As before, however, tragedy strikes as <b>a</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> frightens Pam's horse when she is out riding and throws her, causing a second miscarriage. [...] In 1980, Pam watches Digger die slowly and painfully {{as a result of his}} decades of heavy drinking. On Digger's deathbed, he tells Pam that she's not his biological child, but born after an affair her mother had with Hutch McKinney. Overwhelmed by a sense of loss after Digger's death and deathbed confession, she pushes to find out more about what happened to her mother. She develops a notion – a dream born out of grief – that perhaps her mother isn't dead after all. Then a private investigator turns up evidence that her mother had not died as Digger had believed, but was alive in Houston. Meanwhile, Bobby has taken over Ewing Oil while J.R. is convalescing after being shot. Pam watches her husband get deeper and deeper into the heart of business in an effort to prove himself, and takes note of Bobby's instinctive attraction to power, which she realizes might be a danger to their marriage.|$|E
