5|$|Like in {{the first}} game, Sora can summon a Disney {{character}} to aid him in battle. Summons will replace the two computer-controlled characters and fight alongside Sora {{for as long as}} the Drive Gauge allows, or until Sora's HP runs out. Instead of being limited to only one action, Summons now have a menu of their own and are capable of performing solo or cooperative actions with Sora. These actions are performed by pressing the triangle button. The Summon ability and each Drive Form <b>are</b> <b>leveled</b> up separately and by different criteria; obtaining higher levels allows for extended use and in the case of Drive Forms, access to new abilities.|$|E
5|$|The HD remaster covers both Final Fantasy X and its sequel Final Fantasy X-2. The {{first game}} follows {{the journey of}} the {{teenager}} Tidus who is transported {{to the world of}} Spira after an encounter with a creature known as Sin. He becomes one of the guardians of the summoner Yuna, protecting her on a pilgrimage to defeat Sin and finding out how the creature is linked to Tidus' and Yuna's late fathers. Gameplay relies on the Conditional Turn-Based Battle system that allows for swapping party members in mid-combat. Characters <b>are</b> <b>leveled</b> up by means of the Sphere Grid on which the player may choose a specific skill to learn or attribute to improve. The second game is set two years after the events of X and features Yuna as a treasure hunter in search of spheres leading her to Tidus. It reintroduces the series' classic job system {{in the form of the}} Garment Grid: jobs can be acquired as dresspheres, costumes that give the player characters different abilities, throughout the game and may be changed in battle. X-2 includes multiple minigames such as Sphere Break and blitzball, the latter of which also featured prominently in X.|$|E

25|$|Old Dutch {{naturally}} {{evolved into}} Middle Dutch. The year 1150 {{is often cited}} {{as the time of}} the discontinuity, but it actually marks a time of profuse Dutch writing and during this period a rich Medieval Dutch literature developed. There was at that time no overarching standard language; Middle Dutch is rather a collective name for a number of closely related mutually intelligible dialects whose ancestor was Old Dutch. Where Old Dutch fragments are very hard to read for untrained Modern Dutch speakers, the various literary works of Middle Dutch are somewhat more accessible. The most notable difference between Old and Middle Dutch is in a feature of speech known as vowel reduction. Round vowels in word-final syllables are rather frequent in Old Dutch; in Middle Dutch, such vowels <b>are</b> <b>leveled</b> to a schwa.|$|E
500|$|Criticisms <b>are</b> <b>leveled</b> {{against each}} method of valuation. [...] The {{opportunity}} cost method [...] "depends on the lost earnings {{of the worker}} so that a toilet cleaned by a lawyer has much greater value than one cleaned by a janitor", {{which means that the}} value varies too drastically. There are also issues with the uniformity of this method not just across multiple individuals, but also for a single person: it [...] "may not be uniform across the entire day or across days of the week." [...] There is also the issue of whether any enjoyment of the activity should be deducted from the opportunity cost estimate.|$|E
500|$|The CT scan in 2006, led by Alexander Huppertz, the {{director}} of the Imaging Science Institute in Berlin, revealed a wrinkled face of Nefertiti carved in the inner core of the bust. The results were published in the April 2009 Radiology journal. The scan revealed that Thutmose placed layers of varying thickness on top of the limestone core. The inner face has creases around her mouth and cheeks and a swelling on the nose. The creases and the bump on the nose <b>are</b> <b>leveled</b> by the outermost stucco layer. According to Huppertz, this may reflect [...] "aesthetic ideals of the era". The 2006 scan provided greater detail than the 1992 one, revealing subtle details just 1–2mm under the stucco.|$|E

2500|$|Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes {{features}} similar gameplay to Disney Infinity. Each {{character can}} equip a [...] "Pack" [...] or a [...] "Tool." [...] Packs are {{items that are}} worn and can be equipped on a character's back, occasionally shown {{as some sort of}} backpack. Tools are items, such as rifles, that can be equipped in a character's hand. Some aspects of the game, however, have been changed. In addition to ground movement, certain characters will be able to fly and hover. The size of Toybox worlds and Playset have been increased, notably due to the inclusion of flying. Certain characters can climb walls, including the Hulk. The level cap of playable characters has been expanded from Level 15 to Level 20. Characters can be [...] "leveled up" [...] by collecting sparks. A [...] "Skill Tree" [...] has been incorporated into the game and can be used to upgrade a character's abilities. The figures from the first game will also receive additional abilities through the Skill Tree. The choices made in the Skill Tree are semi-permanent, as players have the options to reset the Skill Tree choices by resetting their character to Level 0. Some characters can jump long distances, including Hulk. Each character plays differently from another, with characters being roughly divided into two categories, Ranged and Melee. Ranged characters fight from far distances, while Melee characters fight using close combat. Signature moves can be unlocked as the player progresses. For example, Drax primarily utilizes short-ranged melee attacks to defeat enemies, while Star-Lord can use ranged pistols. As characters <b>are</b> <b>leveled</b> up, new abilities will be unlocked. Iron Man's ground slam and Hulk's Thunderclap abilities can be unlocked once players have enough Skill Points. Characters' upgrades differ. Iron Man can upgrade his blasting capabilities, while Thor and Hulk can upgrade their strength, using the new Special Skills and Combat system. All upgrades, skills and progress applied to the character will be saved to the figurine. The freeform unlock system in Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes replaces the roulette-based unlock system from Disney Infinity. If a player is defeated in-game, they must wait a certain time frame until they can use the character they were using again. A map scanner has been implemented to allow players can get around worlds more easily. Mission givers are also present in the game. In order to web-sling players do not need to attach their webs to surroundings near by.|$|E
6000|$|Third. As Christ, as Advocate, pleads against Satan the {{interest}} that his Father hath in his chosen, so also he pleads against him by no less authority-his own interest in them. [...] "Holy Father," [...] saith he, [...] "keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me" [...] (John 17:11). Keep them {{while in the}} world from the evil, the soul-damning evil of it. These words are directed to the Father, but they <b>are</b> <b>leveled</b> against the accusations of the enemy, and were spoken here to show what Christ will do for his, against our foe, when he is above. How, I say, he will urge before his Father his own interest in us against Satan, and against all his accusations, when he brings them to the bar of God's tribunal, with design to work our utter ruin. And is there not a great deal in it? As if Christ should say, Father, my people have an adversary who will accuse them for their faults before thee; but I will be their Advocate, and as I have bought them of thee, I will plead my right against him (John 10:28). Our English proverb is, Interest will not lie; interest will make a man do that which otherwise he would not. How many thousands are there for whom Christ doth not so much as once open his mouth, but leaves them to the accusations of Satan, and to Ahab's judgment, nay, a worse, because there is none to plead their cause? And why doth he not concern himself with them? but because he is not interested in them-"I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me, for they are thine; and all mine are thine, and I am glorified in them" [...] (John 17:9,10).|$|E

50|$|Often, token economies <b>are</b> <b>leveled</b> programs. Clients {{can pass}} through {{different}} levels {{until they reach}} the highest level. At that point, behaviors are performed without token reinforcement. Higher levels require more complex behaviors.

Thus, such Old Saxon words like gisprekan (spoken) or dagô (days' - gen. pl.) became gespreken and daghe, dage.|$|E
