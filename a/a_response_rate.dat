25|$|A non-representative {{survey on}} the sexual {{behaviour}} of American students published in 1997 and based on questionnaires had <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> of about 8–9%. Its results showed 15% of homosexual and bisexual males, 21% of lesbian and female bisexual students, 11% of heterosexual males and 9% of female heterosexual students committed to BDSM related fantasies. In all groups the level of practical BDSM experiences were around 6%. Within the group of openly lesbian and bisexual females the quote was significantly higher, at 21%. Independent of their sexual orientation, about 12% of all questioned students, 16% of lesbians and female bisexuals and 8% of heterosexual males articulated an interest in spanking. Experience with this sexual behaviour was indicated by 30% of male heterosexuals, 33% of female bisexuals and lesbians, and 24% of the male gay and bisexual men and female heterosexual women. Even though this study was not considered representative, other surveys indicate similar dimensions in a differing target groups.|$|E

A defined endpoint has to be specified, such as a survival or <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>rate.</b> For example: the appearance of lung cancer in a 5-year period.
