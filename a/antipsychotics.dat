5|$|Most {{people on}} <b>antipsychotics</b> have side effects.

Risperidone has a similar rate of extrapyramidal symptoms to haloperidol. It remains unclear whether the newer <b>antipsychotics</b> reduce the chances of developing neuroleptic malignant syndrome or tardive dyskinesia, a rare but serious neurological disorder.|$|E
5|$|The {{first-line}} {{psychiatric treatment}} for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication, which {{can reduce the}} positive symptoms of psychosis in about 7 to 14 days. <b>Antipsychotics,</b> however, fail to significantly improve the negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. In those on <b>antipsychotics,</b> continued use decreases the risk of relapse. There is little evidence regarding effects from their use beyond two or three years.

40|$|Background <b>Antipsychotic</b> {{medications}} {{have been}} reduced severity and duration of acute psychotic episode {{and the number of}} recurrent psychotic episodes among persons with schizophrenia by long-term use of this medication. However, poor adherence to <b>antipsychotic</b> medication in schizophrenia has been associated with increased rate of rehospitalisation and relapse. The nonadherence to <b>antipsychotic</b> medication is often underestimated. Good adherence to <b>antipsychotic</b> medication is one of the corner stones of long remissions. Conclusions On the basis of different studies it could be concluded that around one half of the schizophrenia patients have poor adherence to <b>antipsychotic</b> medication. To increase adherence to <b>antipsychotic</b> medication good therapeutic alliance should be established with positive emotions, bilateral communication and patient involvement in decision making. The adherence to the <b>antipsychotic</b> medication could be improved with the agreement about psychopharmacotherapy. <b>Antipsychotic</b> therapy should be understandable, tolerable and acceptable for the patien...|$|R
5000|$|Neurotensin {{has been}} implicated in the {{modulation}} of dopamine signaling, and produces a spectrum of pharmacological effects resembling those of <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs, leading to the suggestion that neurotensin may be an endogenous neuroleptic. Neurotensin-deficient mice display defects in responses to several <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs {{consistent with the idea}} that neurotensin signaling is a key component underlying at least some <b>antipsychotic</b> drug actions. [...] These mice exhibit modest defects in prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex, a model that has been widely used to investigate <b>antipsychotic</b> drug action in animals. <b>Antipsychotic</b> drug administration augments PPI under certain conditions. Comparisons between normal and neurotensin-deficient mice revealed striking differences in the ability of different <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs to augment PPI. While the atypical <b>antipsychotic</b> drug clozapine augmented PPI normally in neurotensin-deficient mice, the conventional <b>antipsychotic</b> haloperidol and the newer atypical <b>antipsychotic</b> quetiapine were ineffective in these mice, in contrast to normal mice where these drugs significantly augmented PPI. These results suggest that certain <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs require neurotensin for at least some of their effects. Neurotensin-deficient mice also display defects in striatal activation following haloperidol, but not clozapine administration in comparison to normal wild type mice, indicating that striatal neurotensin is required for the full spectrum of neuronal responses to a subset of <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs.|$|R
5|$|For {{people who}} are {{unwilling or unable to}} take {{medication}} regularly, long-acting depot preparations of <b>antipsychotics</b> may be used to achieve control. They reduce the risk of relapse to a greater degree than oral medications. When used in combination with psychosocial interventions, they may improve long-term adherence to treatment. The American Psychiatric Association suggests considering stopping <b>antipsychotics</b> in some people if there are no symptoms for more than a year.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is antipsychotic medication, along with counselling, {{job training and}} social rehabilitation. It is unclear whether typical or atypical <b>antipsychotics</b> are better. In {{those who do not}} improve with other <b>antipsychotics</b> clozapine may be tried.

Additionally, nefazodone is documented to have caused clitoral engorgement, as distinct from clitoral priapism, in one case, and clitoral priapism can sometimes start as a result of, or only after, the discontinuation of <b>antipsychotics</b> or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E

40|$|The {{persistent}} use of doses {{in excess}} of recommended levels is associated with increased risks of adverse reactions without evidence of additional benefits. Such treatment modality was evaluated in hospitalized psychiatric patients. During a 6 -year recruitment period, a consecutive series of psychiatric inpatients receiving <b>antipsychotic</b> therapy were included. At admission, sociodemographic and clinical data, including <b>antipsychotic</b> drug use, were collected, and the 18 -item version of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale was administered. At discharge, data on <b>antipsychotic</b> drug therapy were collected. Prescribed daily doses were converted into multiples of the defined daily doses. Using a cut-off score of a prescribed daily dose/defined daily dose as a ratio of more than 1. 5 both at admission and at discharge assessments, a total of 62 (15. 4 %) patients persistently received high <b>antipsychotic</b> dose. With less stringent criteria (prescribed daily dose/defined daily dose as a ratio of more than 2), however, only 4. 4 % of the entire sample was persistently exposed to high <b>antipsychotic</b> doses.

5|$|Protease inhibitors, nefazodone, sertraline, grapefruit, fluoxetine, erythromycin, diltiazem, {{clarithromycin}} {{inhibit the}} metabolism of midazolam, {{leading to a}} prolonged action. St John's wort, rifapentine, rifampin, rifabutin, phenytoin enhance the metabolism of midazolam leading to a reduced action. Sedating antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine, sedative antihistamines, opioids, <b>antipsychotics</b> and alcohol enhance the sedative effects of midazolam. Midazolam is metabolized almost completely by cytochrome P450-3A4. Atorvastatin administration along with midazolam results in a reduced elimination rate of midazolam. St John's wort decreases the blood levels of midazolam. Grapefruit juice reduces intestinal 3A4 and results in less metabolism and higher plasma concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are also}} used to treat the acute panic caused by {{hallucinogen}} intoxication. Benzodiazepines {{are also used}} to calm the acutely agitated individual and can, if required, be given via an intramuscular injection. They can sometimes be effective in the short-term treatment of psychiatric emergencies such as acute psychosis as in schizophrenia or mania, bringing about rapid tranquillization and sedation until the effects of lithium or neuroleptics (<b>antipsychotics)</b> take effect. Lorazepam is most commonly used but clonazepam is sometimes prescribed for acute psychosis or mania; their long-term use is not recommended due to risks of dependence. Further research investigating the use of benzodiazepines alone and in combination with antipsychotic medications for treating acute psychosis is warranted.|$|E
5|$|Nonbenzodiazepines are {{contraindicated}} during benzodiazepine withdrawal as {{they are}} cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and can induce dependence. Alcohol is also cross tolerant with benzodiazepines and more toxic and thus caution is needed to avoid replacing one dependence with another. During withdrawal, fluoroquinolone-based antibiotics are best avoided if possible; they displace benzodiazepines from their binding site and reduce GABA function and, thus, may aggravate withdrawal symptoms. <b>Antipsychotics</b> are not recommended for benzodiazepine withdrawal (or other CNS depressant withdrawal states) especially clozapine, olanzapine or low potency phenothiazines e.g. chlorpromazine as they lower the seizure threshold and can worsen withdrawal effects; if used extreme caution is required.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Atypical <b>antipsychotic</b> {{drugs have}} been shown to protect PC 12 cells from cell death induced by a variety of stimuli in culture. Recently, it has been {{postulated}} that trophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), play a role in preventing cell death. It has been shown that <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs attenuate the decrease in rat hippocampal BDNF that results from immobilization-induced stress. We aimed to determine whether the neuroprotective effects of <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs could be mediated through glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Methods: We investigated the effects of the atypical <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs quetiapine and clozapine and the typical <b>antipsychotic</b> haloperidol on the secretion of GDNF from rat C 6 glioma cells.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Excessive {{prescribing}} of <b>antipsychotic</b> {{therapy is}} a concern owing to their potential to cause serious adverse events. We explored variation {{in the use of}} <b>antipsychotic</b> therapy across nursing homes in Ontario, Canada, and determined if prescribing decisions were based on clinical indications. METHODS: A point-prevalence study of <b>antipsychotic</b> therapy use in 47 322 residents of 485 provincially regulated nursing homes in December 2003. Facilities were classified into quintiles according to their mean <b>antipsychotic</b> prescribing rates. Residents were grouped into those with a potential clinical indication or no identified clinical indication for <b>antipsychotic</b> therapy. RESULTS: A total of 15 317 residents (32. 4 %) were dispensed an <b>antipsychotic</b> agent. The mean rate of <b>antipsychotic</b> prescribing by home ranged from 20. 9 % in the quintile of facilities with the lowest mean prescribing rates (quintile 1) to 44. 3 % in facilities with the highest mean prescribing rates (quintile 5). Compared with individuals residing in nursing homes with the lowest mean <b>antipsychotic</b> prescribing rates, those residing in facilities with the highest rates were 3 {{times more likely to be}} dispensed an <b>antipsychotic</b> agent (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3. 0; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 2. 74 - 3. 19).

25|$|The {{side effects}} {{reportedly}} {{associated with the}} various atypical <b>antipsychotics</b> vary and are medication-specific. Generally speaking, atypical <b>antipsychotics</b> are widely believed to have a lower likelihood {{for the development of}} tardive dyskinesia than the typical <b>antipsychotics.</b> However, tardive dyskinesia typically develops after long-term (possibly decades) use of <b>antipsychotics.</b> It is not clear, then, if atypical <b>antipsychotics,</b> having been in use for a relatively short time, produce a lower incidence of tardive dyskinesia.|$|E
25|$|Atypical <b>antipsychotics</b> {{are most}} {{commonly}} administered orally. <b>Antipsychotics</b> {{can also be}} injected, but this method is not as common. They are lipid-soluble, are readily absorbed from the digestive tract, and can easily pass the blood–brain barrier and placental barriers. Once in the brain, the <b>antipsychotics</b> work at the synapse by binding to the receptor. <b>Antipsychotics</b> are completely metabolized {{in the body and}} the metabolites are excreted in urine. These drugs have relatively long half-lives. Each drug has a different half-life, but the occupancy of the D2 receptor falls off within 24 hours with atypical <b>antipsychotics,</b> while lasting over 24 hours for the typical <b>antipsychotics.</b> This may explain why relapse into psychosis happens quicker with atypical <b>antipsychotics</b> than with typical <b>antipsychotics,</b> as the drug is excreted faster and is no longer working in the brain. Physical dependence with these drugs is very rare. However, if the drug is abruptly discontinued, psychotic symptoms, movement disorders, and sleep difficulty may be observed. It is possible that withdrawal is rarely seen because the AAP are stored in body fat tissues and slowly released.|$|E

40|$|<b>Antipsychotic</b> {{sensitization}} {{and tolerance}} {{refer to the}} increased and decreased drug effects due to past drug use, respectively. Both effects reflect the long-term impacts of <b>antipsychotic</b> treatment on the brain and result from the brain’s adaptive response to the foreign property of the drug. In this review, clinical evidence of the behavioral aspect of <b>antipsychotic</b> sensitization and tolerance is selectively reviewed, followed by an overview of preclinical literature that examines these behavioral characteristics and the related pharmacological and nonpharmacological factors. Next, recent work on the developmental impacts of adolescent <b>antipsychotic</b> sensitization and tolerance is presented and recent research that delineates the neurobiological mechanisms of <b>antipsychotic</b> sensitization and tolerance is summarized. A theoretical framework based on “drug learning and memory” principles is proposed {{to account for the}} phenomena of <b>antipsychotic</b> sensitization and tolerance. It is maintained that <b>antipsychotic</b> sensitization and tolerance follow basic principles of learning or acquisition (“induction”) and memory (“expression”). The induction and expression of both effects reflect the consequences of associative and nonassociative processing and are strongly influenced by various pharmacological, environmental, and behavioral factors. Drug-induced neuroplasticity, such as functional changes of striatal dopamine D 2 and prefrontal serotonin (5 -HT) 2 A receptors and their mediated signaling pathways, in principle, is responsible for <b>antipsychotic</b> sensitization and tolerance. Understanding the behavioral characteristics and neurobiological underpinnings of <b>antipsychotic</b> sensitization and tolerance has greatly enhanced our understanding of mechanisms of <b>antipsychotic</b> action, and may have important implications for future drug discovery and clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|During {{the four}} decades that {{research}} {{has been carried out}} on <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs, a variety of methods have been used to study the effects of these compounds on dopamine neurotransmission. An important issue in this research was to find an explanation for the difference between "typical" and "atypical" <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs. The hypothesis that the beneficial properties and the motor side effects of <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs result from their effects on different groups of dopamine neurons has received considerable attention. Numerous researchers have tried. to discover regiospecific actions of <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs in mesolimbic and in mesocortical dopamine neurons. An overview of these research attempts is presented here. Electrophysiological studies showed a selective action of atypical <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs on A 10 dopamine neurons. It was found that chronic treatment with these compounds induced a preferential depolarisation block of the A 10 neurons that project to the mesolimbic areas. The model represents certain clinical features of <b>antipsychotic</b> drug use and offers a possible explanation for the lack of extrapyramidal side effects of atypical <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs. Dopamine neurons projecting from A 10 to the frontal cortex are also considered as a possible site of action of atypical <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs. Microdialysis studies have shown that certain atypical <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs selectively enhance the release of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex when compared with typical <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs. The finding that repeated treatment with <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs increased dopamine D- 2 receptor binding in the frontal cortex confirms the significance of this brain area. These properties might indeed explain certain beneficial effects of atypical <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs such as improvement of cognitive dysfunction. However the effects of typical and atypical <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs in the frontal cortex could not be fully differentiated, which illustrates the difficulty of localising clinical effects of <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs in terms of regional dopamine neurons. Recently new insights into the mechanism of action of typical and atypical <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs have been published. Clinical positron emission tomography (PET) studies have indicated that a moderate dopamine D 2 receptor occupancy, probably combined with a high dissociation rate, might provide the optimal clinical conditions for an <b>antipsychotic</b> drug, without inducing extrapyramidal side effects. Moreover the efficacy of benzamides as atypical <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs suggests that low to moderate dopamine D 2 blockade is probably the most important-if not the only-criterion that determines "atypicality". Interestingly these new insights are based on PET studies of the human basal ganglia and not on the comparison of different brain areas. Apparently, according to this concept an ideal <b>antipsychotic</b> drug need not to act on a particular type of dopamine neurons, as it is the moderate dopamine D 2 receptor occupancy that determines the desirable clinical effects. It is concluded that both beneficial actions and side effects, of <b>antipsychotic</b> drugs might be dose dependently localised in A 9 as well as A 10 dopamine neurons. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.
