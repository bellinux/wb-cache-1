40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} the contemporary case law of European courts regarding Community trade mark. The thesis {{is composed of}} five chapters. First chapter characterizes Community trade mark as a legal instrument {{of the law of}} the European Union. Second chapter analyzes relevant sources of law. Third chapter deals with institutions that are crucial mainly for the registration and protection of Community trade marks. Then the fourth chapter describes the registration process before the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market. First part of this chapter focuses on the formalities of an application of the Community trade mark filed at the Office. Second part is concerned with the right of priority. Third part looks at absolute <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> refusal of an application. Fourth part refers to relative <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> refusal. Finally, the fifth part describes the <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>revocation</b> of the rights of the Community trade mark.

40|$|Revocation and Invalidity of European Trade Mark Revocation and {{invalidity}} of European trade mark, {{more precisely}} termed as Community trade mark (hereinafter as "CTM"), {{is a specific}} field of trade mark law of the European Union. It is Council Regulation (EC) No 207 / 2009 of 26 February 2009 on the Community trade mark which forms a legal basis in this regard. The practice of the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market and especially the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union play very significant role in this area. The practice of the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market and the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Union regarding Directive 2008 / 95 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2008 to approximate {{the laws of the}} Member States relating to trade marks is also relevant <b>for</b> the <b>revocation</b> and invalidity of CTM as this Directive provides <b>for</b> the <b>revocation</b> and invalidity of national trade marks in similar manner.

5000|$|The {{number of}} permit {{revocations}} is typically small. The <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> <b>revocation</b> in most states, other than expiration of a time-limited permit without renewal, is typically {{the commission of}} a gross misdemeanor or felony by the permit holder. While these crimes are often firearm-related (including unlawful carry), a study of eight years of Texas data found that concealed handgun licensees were {{much less likely to}} be convicted of crimes than were nonlicensees. The same study found that licensees' convictions {{were more likely to be}} for less common crimes, [...] "such as sexual offenses, gun offenses, or offenses involving a death." [...] This is also in line with a much cited research study published in 1997 researching county level data from 1977 to 1992 concluding that allowing citizens to carry concealed weapons deters violent crimes and it appears to produce no increase in accidental deaths. However, a 2014 Stanford University study reported that these laws were associated with an 8% increase of aggravated assaults, and a 2017 NBER working paper found that the laws caused a 13-15% increase in violent crime, though the murder and property crime rates were unaffected.
