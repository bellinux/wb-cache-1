50|$|The {{aboriginal}} cockroach (Periplaneta aboriginea) is {{a species}} of cockroach belonging to the family Blattidae. Unlike the related (and misnamed) <b>Australian</b> <b>cockroach,</b> this is an Australian native endemic, only recorded from {{the northern part of}} the Great Dividing Range in Queensland, as far north as the Cape York Peninsula.|$|E
50|$|This wasp reproduces {{by laying}} {{eggs in the}} egg cases, or oothecae, of {{cockroach}}es. The wasp larvae use the cockroach eggs as a food source. Host cockroaches include the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana), <b>Australian</b> <b>cockroach</b> (P. australasiae), brown cockroach (P. brunnea), Oriental cockroach (Blatta orientalis), whitemargined cockroach (Melanozosteria soror), and harlequin cockroach (Neostylopyga rhombifolia).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Australian</b> <b>cockroach</b> (Periplaneta australasiae) is {{a common}} species of {{tropical}} cockroach, with a length of 23 - 35 mm.It is brown overall, with the tegmina having a conspicuous lateral pale stripe or margin, and the pronotum (head shield) with a sharply contrasting pale or yellow margin. It is very similar in appearance to the American cockroach and may be easily mistaken for it. It is, however, slightly smaller than the American cockroach, and has a yellow margin on the thorax and yellow streaks at its sides near the wing base.|$|E

5000|$|Despite its name, the <b>Australian</b> <b>cockroach</b> is a {{cosmopolitan}} species, and an introduced species in Australia. [...] P. australasiae probably originated in Africa. It {{is very common}} in the southern United States and in tropical climates, {{and can be found}} in many locations throughout the world due to its travels by shipping and commerce between locations. The insect can travel quickly, often darting out of sight when someone enters a room, and can fit into small cracks and under doors despite its fairly large size. It is known to be very mobile; its wings allow it to be quite a capable flier.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Title of Thesis: TRANSMISSION OF CYMBIDIUM MOSAIC VIRUS IN ONCIDIUM ORCHIDS BY PERIPLANETA AUSTRALASIAE Carol Dianne Allen, Master of Science. 2012 Thesis Directed by: Gary Coleman, Ph. D. 				 Department of Plant Science and Landscape Architecture Cymbidium mosaic {{virus is}} the most common disease in orchids infecting a large number of {{cultivated}} orchids found in all phases of the industry and around the world. Its transmission occurs through contact by contaminated cutting tools, human hands, or water. Although insects known to transmit plant viruses have been exposed to orchid viruses, none have been found to successfully transmit Cymbidium mosaic virus. Periplaneta australasiae, the <b>Australian</b> <b>cockroach,</b> is a common greenhouse pest that is known to feed on orchid plants. In controlled conditions Australian cockroaches were given inoculation access through feeding activity on known CymMV positive orchid plants and then allowed to feed on virus free plants. The virus free plants were isolated from subsequent insect exposure and after a period of time samples from the feeding damage sites were analyzed for the presence of virus RNA through nested and hemi-nested PCR techniques. A statistically significant number of samples were positive demonstrating that with high population numbers and long term exposure, virus transmission is possible...|$|E

40|$|Four {{new species}} and two new genera of thelastomatoid are {{described}} from {{several species of}} <b>Australian</b> burrowing <b>cockroaches</b> (Blattodea: Panesthiinae; Geoscapheinae). Corpicracens munozae n. g., n. sp., Pseudodesmicola botti n. g., n. sp. and Cephalobellus nolani n. sp. are described from Geoscapheus dilatatus (Blattodea: Geoscapheinae) from Mendooran, New South Wales; one new thelastomatid, Blattophila praelongicauda n. sp., is described from Panesthia cribrata from Lamington National Park, Queensland. Corpicracens munozae n. g., n. sp. is long and slender, with a monodelphic female reproductive system, a clavate corpus with a slight posterior pseudobulb, oval eggs flattened at the poles, and a relatively robust, subulate tail. Pseudodesmicola botti n. g., n. sp. is slightly more robust in body, also has a monodelphic reproductive system, a cylindrical corpus with a posterior pseudobulb, ovoid eggs and a very long, subulate tail. Cephalobellus nolani n. sp. is distinguished from {{other members of the}} genus by its relatively short and broad body and egg shape. Lastly, Blattophila praelongicauda n. sp. is distinguished from other members of the genus by having eggs with a single, polar operculum, tail length, and position of the vulva, nerve ring and excretory pore. An additional species, known by a single specimen from Panesthia tryoni tryoni from the same locality is characterised but not named. The species found are all relatively rare parasites of <b>Australian</b> burrowing <b>cockroaches,</b> each having a prevalence of less than 10 %...|$|R

50|$|The largest <b>cockroach</b> is the <b>Australian</b> giant {{burrowing}} <b>cockroach</b> (Macropanesthia rhinoceros). This {{species can}} attain {{a length of}} 8.3 cm and a weight of 36 g. The giant cockroach (Blaberus giganteus) of the neotropics reaches comparable lengths although is not as massive as the burrowing species. The termites, traditionally classified in their own order (Isoptera), have recently been re-considered to belong in Blattodea. The largest of the termites is the African species Macrotermes bellicosus. The queen of this species can attain a length of 14 cm and breadth of 5.5 cm across the abdomen; other adults, on the other hand, are {{about a third of}} the size.|$|R
40|$|We report 21 thelastomatoid species parasitizing 31 {{described}} and 5 undescribed geoscapheine and panesthiine cockroaches, representing all but 1 {{of the known}} species of these subfamilies in Australia. The nematodes have 3 distinct patterns of host distribution: dominant, moderate and rare. The 4 dominant species, Cordonicola gibsoni, Leidynemella fusiformis, Travassosinema jaidenae and Aoruroides queenslandensis, are highly prevalent, found in nearly all host species examined, and broadly distributed. The 8 moderate species have lower prevalences but are still widely distributed. Man), of these species are more common in one host subfamily than the other. The remaining 9 rare species have highly restricted host and geographical distributions. Six of the 21 species are exclusive to geoscapheines, 5 to panesthiines and 10 are shared. These patterns suggest {{that most of the}} reported thelastomatoid species are generalists rather than specialists, that host-specificity within this group is low and that co-evolutionary speciation has had little, if any, impact on structuring the thelastomatoid fauna of <b>Australian</b> burrowing <b>cockroaches.</b> In a broader context, this study provides the first comprehensive examination of the role of coevolutionary speciation and host specificity in regulating the distribution of pinworms in arthropods...|$|R
40|$|The {{external}} morphology {{and distribution}} of sensilla on maxillary and labial palpi are described for 3 <b>Australian</b> cave-dwelling <b>cockroach</b> species, Paratemnopteryx stonei, P. howarthi, and P. sp. nov (Blattaria : Blattellidae), using scanning electron microscopy. The apex of the maxillary palpus expands ventrally into a flexible pad with a distinct sensillar field. The total number of sensilla ranges from 1045 (males) – 1486 (females). Sensillar fields of females are larger and contain more sensilla {{than those of the}} males, although the density of sensilla is usually equal or greater for males. Papilla-like groove-and-slit chemoreceptors comprise 93 – 97 % of the sensilla. Two types of trichoid sensilla occur along with bifurcuted sensilla and rare basiconic sensilla that are poreless and have an inflexible socket. Chaetic sensilla occur on all species and several thousand pectinate scales, with bulbous bases, and spicules are present in large fields {{on each side of the}} sensillar field. The apex of the labial palpus is only slightly expanded into a sensillar field. Sensillar diversity is similar to the maxillary palpus but there are only 5 – 29 % as many sensilla, the number ranging from 97 (males) – 346 (females). Sensillar fields of females are slightly to much larger than those of males but the sensillar density is equal between the sexes or greater on males. Two types of trichoid and one or two types of basiconic sensilla occur on each species. Chaetic chemoreceptors are present along with three types of non-socket spines. Sensilla varied moderately in morphology and gender-related abundance from those on epigean cockroach species...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the effects of local climate aridity on the richness and composition of the thelastomatoid (Nematoda: Oxyurida) guild parasitizing the <b>Australian</b> giant burrowing <b>cockroach,</b> Macropanesthia rhinoceros (Blattodea: Geoscapheinae). In total, 9 thelastomatoid species parasitized this cockroach in north-eastern Australia (Queensland). Local observed richness ranged from 3 species (in Cooktown, Magnetic Island, Maiden Springs and Whitsunday Island) to 7 species (in Rochford Scrub). The lowest richness occurred in both relatively wet and city climates, and the highest richness was in moderate climates. Three species, Cordonicola gibsoni, Leidynemella fusiformis and Travassosinema jaidenae, were found at all 13 collection sites. One species, Geoscaphenema megaovian, was found exclusively in dry to moderate climates. The remaining species, Blattophila sphaerolaima, Coronostoma australiae, Desmicola ornata, Hammerschmidtiella hochi and Faidenema rhinoceratum, were found in moderate climates only. We hypothesize that the egg is the stage in the thelastomatoid life-cycle most vulnerable to the effects of adverse climate and that the geographical distribution for each species is, in part, bound by environments that are too dry, resulting in egg desiccation, and by environments that are too wet, resulting in decreased oxygen uptake across the egg-shell and in osmotic lysing...|$|R
