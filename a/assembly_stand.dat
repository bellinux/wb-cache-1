40|$|This paper {{describes}} an innovative approach to testing satellites that reduces test flow time and risk. The approach uses a uniquely designed <b>assembly</b> <b>stand,</b> created by INTRASPACE, that accommodates the satellite assembly process {{as well as}} in-place environmental testing. The satellite is assembled, functionally tested and environmentally tested on a single <b>assembly</b> <b>stand</b> platform. The platform rotates in 2 -axes to facilitate access to {{all areas of the}} spacecraft. For environmental test, a 2 ̆ 2 bell jar 2 ̆ 2 vacuum dome is placed over the spacecraft. Vacuum, Thermal Vacuum and Acoustic Testing are made possible by the modular arrangement of the dome, liquid nitrogen cold walls, quartz heating tubes and high power acoustical transducers. Since the vacuum dome is made of RF transparent material, environmental testing closely simulates the on-orbit operation. For example, this approach permits measurement of the multipacting phenomenon under actual RF link operations. The in-place test concept reduces test setup time, test breakdown time and spacecraft handling. The flow-through time saved during the test is about 250 / 0. The test parameters were selected using MIL-STD- 1540 B as a guide. The test stand has been tested to 10 - 6 TORR and provides for a rotisserie mode during thermal environments...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFrequent {{lower limb}} amputations {{caused by the}} growing {{incidence}} of vascular diseases and traumatic injuries currently represent a significant global problem. A properly constructed and adjusted prosthetic device {{is a key to}} the reintegration of these patients into their family, social, and working environments. The main objective of the submitted article is to provide a clear summary of the principles regarding the lower limb prosthesis construction, highlight the fundamental principles and rules to be applied to the assembly in the <b>assembly</b> <b>stand,</b> and the static and dynamic assessment of a prosthesis. The article also briefly points out the necessity of proper construction of a prosthetic socket and in the concluding part it describes unfavourable consequences of the failure to adhere to the structural lines and improper adjustment of components during the gait...|$|E

40|$|There is an OR module <b>assembly</b> <b>stand</b> in use at IB 4. This {{design has}} been {{approved}} by safety, as presented by Mike Foley, and has been successfully used. Another one is needed at the D-zero assembly building, but some modifications need to be made. This report will show that the new modified design {{is at least as}} strong, if not stronger, than the older IB 4 design in every aspect. Since the weight distribution of the OR modules on the sling is indeterminate, this report compares three cases of support for the entire assembly: the lowest two beams only, the lowest four beams only, and all six beams. In each of these cases, the new design is stronger than the old design in maximum allowable weight. The ability of the the cradle to support the weight is also shown. For all of the failure conditions except for two, the cradle is stronger than the beams that it supports. In the two excepted situations, the calculated limit of the cradle is less than the beams it supports. This is because no credit is taken for the sling and strongback, which in reality will relieve much of the horizontal load...|$|E

50|$|Mr. Musa had {{requested}} a {{dissolution of the}} National Assembly on January 24, 2003, 4 years, 7 months and 4 days after the last general election, August 27, 1998. That dissolution was granted by Young on February 4, 2003, at which time the <b>Assembly</b> <b>stood</b> dissolved while preparations were made for elections on March 5, 2003. The PUP won the elections, with Musa continuing as Prime Minister. But his term did not begin, says Gordon, until {{the first meeting of}} the new National Assembly, on April 4, 2003. Since a National Assembly must continue for five years from this first sitting under Section 84, subsec. 2, the current <b>assembly</b> shall <b>stand</b> dissolved- unless sooner dissolved- on April 3, 2008. It follows that the latest a general election can be called after that date is July 3, 2008. Mr. Musa ended speculation over the date of general elections by calling them for February 7, 2008.|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} other presbyterian churches, the Presbyterian Church in Ireland {{is governed by}} courts of elders. That is to say, it is governed by presbyterian polity. At {{the bottom of the}} {{hierarchy}} of courts is the Kirk Session, the court of the individual local churches; representatives of several Kirk Sessions form the Presbytery, the local area court. As in many other presbyterian churches the Synod, or regional level, is now left out. A Synod had authority over a group of presbyteries. At the level of the island of Ireland, the General <b>Assembly</b> <b>stands</b> {{at the top of this}} structure.|$|R

50|$|In the Portrait of Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier and {{his wife}} (1788), the man {{and his wife}} are tied {{together}} in an intimate pose. She leans on his shoulder while he pauses from his work to look up at her. David casts them in a soft light, not in the sharp contrast of Brutus or of the Horatii. Also of interest—Lavoisier was a tax collector, as well as a famous chemist. Though he spent some of his money trying to clean up swamps and eradicate malaria, he was nonetheless sent to the guillotine during the Reign of Terror as an enemy of the people.

Dick, with {{the heart of a}} lion, dashed in bravely. He introduced that about the genie in the casket with marvellous effect; and was applauded to the echo, which did applaud again. He was horribly nervous when he arrived at Birmingham,[22] but when he stood upon the platform, I don't believe his pulse increased ten degrees. A better and quicker audience never listened to man.|$|R
