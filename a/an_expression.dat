However, the expression pattern of hUTP 14 a in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate hUTP 14 <b>a</b> <b>expression</b> and its prognostic value in HCC. Methods: The hUTP 14 <b>a</b> <b>expression</b> was evaluated using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in HCC tissue specimens. The correlations between hUTP 14 <b>a</b> <b>expression</b> and clinicopathological variables were analyzed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the association between hUTP 14 <b>a</b> <b>expression</b> and survival. Independent prognostic factors associated with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed using the Cox proportional-hazards regression model. Results: The IHC data revealed that the hUTP 14 a positivity rate in HCC tissue specimens was significantly higher than that in nontumorous tissue specimens (89. 9 % vs. 72. 7 %, P 0. 05). In addition, no significant correlation was found between nucleolar hUTP 14 <b>a</b> <b>expression</b> and other clinicopathological variables. The 5 -year OS and DFS rates in patients with positive nucleolar hUTP 14 <b>a</b> <b>expression</b> were significantly lower than those in patients with negative hUTP 14 <b>a</b> <b>expression</b> (P = 0. 004 for OS, P = 0. 003 for DFS).

Antihyper-tensive medication consistent of hydrochlorothiazide, hydralazine, and reserpine ameliorated the histopathologic changes and attenuated p 16 INK 4 <b>a</b> <b>expression</b> in kidneys of deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt–treated rats.

Lack of light altered temporal regulation of cdc 2 a in the apical but not root meristem of seedlings. Differential cdc 2 a responses were obtained after different hormone treatments. Signals present only in intact plants were necessary to mediate these responses. Although other control levels have yet to be analyzed, these results suggest that the regulation of cdc 2 <b>a</b> <b>expression</b> may contribute greatly to spatial and temporal regulation of cell division in plants. Our results also show that cdc 2 <b>a</b> <b>expression</b> is not always coupled with cell proliferation but always precedes it. We propose that cdc 2 <b>a</b> <b>expression</b> may reflect <b>a</b> state of competence to divide, and that the release of other controls is necessary for cell division to occur...|$|R
