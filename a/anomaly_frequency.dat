40|$|Preliminary {{results of}} the EU INTAS Project 00810, which aims to improve the methods of {{safeguarding}} satellites in the Earth's magnetosphere from {{the negative effects of}} the space environment, are presented. Anomaly data from the ‘‘Kosmos’’ series satellites in the period 1971 – 1999 are combined in one database, together with similar information on other spacecraft. This database contains, beyond the anomaly information, various characteristics of the space weather: geomagnetic activity indices (Ap, AE and Dst), fluxes and fluences of electrons and protons at different energies, high energy cosmic ray variations and other solar, interplanetary and solar wind data. A comparative analysis of the distribution of each of these parameters relative to satellite anomalies was carried out for the total number of anomalies (about 6000 events), and separately for high (5000 events) and low (about 800 events) altitude orbit satellites. No relation was found between low and high altitude satellite anomalies. Daily numbers of satellite anomalies, averaged by a superposed epoch method around sudden storm commencements and proton event onsets for high (> 1500 km) and low (< 1500 km) altitude orbits revealed a big difference in a behavior. Satellites were divided on several groups according to the orbital characteristics (altitude and inclination). The relation of satellite anomalies to the environmental parameters was found to be different for various orbits that should be taken into account under developing of the <b>anomaly</b> <b>frequency</b> models. © 2004 COSPAR.

40|$|The flux ratios in the {{multiple}} images of gravitationally lensed quasars can {{provide evidence for}} dark matter substructure in the halo of the lensing galaxy if the flux ratios differ from those predicted by a smooth model of the lensing galaxy mass distribution. However, {{it is also possible}} that baryonic structures in the lensing galaxy, such as edge-on discs, can produce flux-ratio anomalies. In this work, we present the first statistical analysis of flux-ratio anomalies due to baryons from a numerical simulation perspective. We select galaxies with various morphological types in the Illustris simulation and ray-trace through the simulated halos, which include baryons in the main lensing galaxies but exclude any substructures, in order to explore the pure baryonic effects. Our ray-tracing results show that the baryonic components can be a major contribution to the flux-ratio anomalies in lensed quasars and that edge-on disc lenses induce the strongest anomalies. We find that the baryonic components increase the probability of finding high flux-ratio anomalies in the early-type lenses by about 8 % and by about 10 - 20 % in the disc lenses. The baryonic effects also induce astrometric anomalies in 13 % of the mock lenses. Our results indicate that the morphology of the lens galaxy becomes important in the analysis of flux-ratio anomalies when considering the effect of baryons, and that the presence of baryons may also partially explain the discrepancy between the observed (high) <b>anomaly</b> <b>frequency</b> and what is expected due to the presence of subhalos as predicted by the CDM simulations.

Methods: The study group comprised 1149 children (554 girls, 595 boys). The children were examined in twelve local nurseries in Sivas, Turkiye. Clinical data were collected by four dentists according to Kreiborg criteria; which includes double teeth, hypodontia, microdontia, and supernumerary teeth. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using the chi-square test. Results: Dental anomalies were found in 2. 0 % of children.

40|$|ABSTRACT-Despite the {{systematic}} {{nature of the}} monsoon rains over India, large year-to-year variations {{in the pattern of}} distribution of rainfall during the season occur. The yearly pattern of rainfall distribution during the monsoon season (May 31 -October 2) for each of the years 1901 - 51 for a network of 105 stations over India is characterized by a set of six distribution parameters. A brief description of the spatial distribution of the different patterns is given to indicate the nature of the component patterns. Polynomial trend analyses of the time series of the distribution parameters indicate oscillatory features. Power spectrum analyses reveal certain significant periods corresponding to the sunspot cycle or some higher harmonics with regional preferences. The variation of distribution parameters in the {{different parts of the country}} with the different sunspot epochs is demonstrated. Studies of the distribution of surface pressure <b>anomalies,</b> <b>frequency</b> of storms and depressions, and the frequency of “breaks in monsoon ” associated with the contrasting sunspot epochs suggest that the monsoon circulation features as well as the characteristics of the rainfall distribution have a periodicity nearing the sunspot cycle.
