40|$|The {{concept of}} phase {{stability}} in <b>a</b> Stark <b>decelerator</b> ensures that polar molecules can be accelerated, guided, or decelerated without loss; molecules {{within a certain}} position and velocity interval are kept together throughout the deceleration process. In this paper {{the influence of the}} transverse motion on phase stability in <b>a</b> Stark <b>decelerator</b> is investigated. For typical deceleration experiments-i. e., for high values of the phase angle phi(0) -the transverse motion considerably enhances the region in phase space for which phase stable deceleration occurs. For low values of phi(0), however, the transverse motion reduces the acceptance of <b>a</b> Stark <b>decelerator</b> and unstable regions in phase space appear. These effects are quantitatively explained in terms of a coupling between the longitudinal and transverse motion. The predicted longitudinal acceptance of <b>a</b> Stark <b>decelerator</b> is verified by measurements on a beam of OH (X (2) Pi(3 / 2),J= 3 / 2) radicals passing through <b>a</b> Stark <b>decelerator...</b>|$|R

40|$|We present {{experiments}} on decelerating and trapping ammonia molecules {{using a combination}} of <b>a</b> Stark <b>decelerator</b> and <b>a</b> traveling wave <b>decelerator.</b> In the traveling wave <b>decelerator</b> <b>a</b> moving potential is created by a series of ring-shaped electrodes to which oscillating high voltages are applied.

40|$|The {{transverse}} motion inside <b>a</b> Stark <b>decelerator</b> plays <b>a</b> {{large role in}} the total efficiency of deceleration. We differentiate between two separate regimes of molecule loss during the slowing process.

Solutions based on modified switching time sequences with the existing decelerator geometry lead to a large gain of stable molecules in the intermediate velocity regime, but fail to address the loss at very low final velocities.

40|$|Abstract:- The {{work to be}} {{presented}} herein is a Computational Fluid Dynamics investigation of the complex fluid mechanisms that occur over blunt body with and without <b>a</b> <b>decelerator,</b> specifically {{with regard to the}} total aerodynamic drag. Drag is needed to decelerate the body. The aim of this research is to design deceleration devices for a blunt body. In this paper a qualitative analysis of the flow structure over a blunt body and blunt body with a double fins decelerator was shown. A drag over moving body consists of two components: pressure drag and friction drag. Drag is due to the effect of viscosity. Pressure drag {{is a result of the}} eddying motions that are generated in the fluid due to the movement of the body. Pressure drag is related to the cross-sectional area of the body and it is associated with the formation of a wake it is also important for separated flows. Frictional drag is a result of the friction between the fluid and the surfaces over which it is flowing. Frictional drag is related to the surface area exposed to the flow and it is associated with the development of boundary layers it is also important for attached flows. For a blunt body, pressure drag is the dominant source of drag, but for streamlined body friction drag is the dominant source of air resistance. In some applications of aerodynamics, a deceleration of a moving body is required therefore the prediction and controlling of the drag is essential. The deceleration devices such as air bag or fins can be added to the body to increase the aerodynamics drag. For a supersonic speed, a flow around blunt body is complicated due to the detached shock wave, flow separation, boundary layer and their interactions. When <b>a</b> <b>decelerator</b> is integrated with the blunt body the flow is subject to sever change of aerodynamic forces and velocity...|$|E
