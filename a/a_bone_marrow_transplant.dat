25|$|In {{the case}} of <b>a</b> <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>transplant,</b> the HSC are removed from a large bone of the donor, {{typically}} the pelvis, through a large needle that reaches {{the center of the}} bone.

25|$|Treatment {{depends on}} the type and severity. Treatment for those with more severe disease often {{includes}} regular blood transfusions, iron chelation, and folic acid. Iron chelation may be done with deferoxamine or deferasirox. Occasionally, <b>a</b> <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>transplant</b> may be an option. Complications may include iron overload from the transfusions with resulting heart or liver disease, infections, and osteoporosis. If the spleen becomes overly enlarged, surgical removal may be required.|$|E

Due to the high median age of patients with CML it is relatively rare for CML {{to be seen in}} pregnant women, despite this, however, chronic myelogenous leukemia can be treated with relative safety at any time during pregnancy with Interferon-alpha hormones.|$|E

25|$|A {{complete}} {{blood type}} would describe {{a full set}} of 30 substances on the surface of RBCs, and an individual's blood type is one of many possible combinations of blood-group antigens. Across the 35 blood groups, over 600 different blood-group antigens have been found.Almost always, an individual has the same blood group for life, but very rarely an individual's blood type changes through addition or suppression of an antigen in infection, malignancy, or autoimmune disease. Another more common cause in blood type change is <b>a</b> <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>transplant.</b> Bone-marrow transplants are performed for many leukemias and lymphomas, among other diseases. If a person receives bone marrow from someone who is a different ABO type (e.g., a type A patient receives a type O bone marrow), the patient's blood type will eventually convert to the donor's type.|$|E
25|$|The precise {{treatment}} intent (curative, adjuvant, neoadjuvant therapeutic, or palliative) {{will depend}} on the tumor type, location, and stage, as well as the general health of the patient. Total body irradiation (TBI) is a radiation therapy technique used to prepare the body to receive <b>a</b> <b>bone</b> <b>marrow</b> <b>transplant.</b> Brachytherapy, in which a radioactive source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment, is another form of radiation therapy that minimizes exposure to healthy tissue during procedures to treat cancers of the breast, prostate and other organs. Radiation therapy has several applications in non-malignant conditions, such as the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, acoustic neuromas, severe thyroid eye disease, pterygium, pigmented villonodular synovitis, and prevention of keloid scar growth, vascular restenosis, and heterotopic ossification. The use of radiation therapy in non-malignant conditions is limited partly by worries about the risk of radiation-induced cancers.|$|E
