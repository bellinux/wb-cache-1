Machining fluid (cutting oil, grinding fluid) {{that consists of}} oil, surface active agent, and extreme pressure agent, <b>anti</b> <b>rust</b> agent etc. is used. It improves machining performance, but it needs waste fluid disposal that is incineration or coagulative precipitation and so on. It causes huge cost and environmental load. Furthermore, it is afraid of workers health hazard for several chemicals while machining. Therefore, the electric rust preventive machining method system (water machining) is proposed and developed. This method uses only harmless water (tap water etc.) as machining fluid. In this paper, improvement of electric rust preventive chip sedimentation system {{that is part of}} water recycle system which is used for machining water purification and re-use. On long time (3 days) preservation of iron chip in water, decreasing of rust and turbidity is examined. Improved electric rust preventive chip sedimentation system is equipped simple circulation filter unit newly and its effectiveness is clarified. When many quantity of iron powder (3 kg) likened to actual sludge is sunken in sedimentation water tank, if electric rust prevention and simple circulation filter activated, turbidity and colour would be decreased greatly. Therefore, it is expected that purification load of next part of filters is decreased and life-time of filter and system will be prolonged...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} pyroaurite-type compound Fe(II) Fe(III) hydroxy-carbonate ('green rust') synthesised from freshly precipitated ferrihydrite and Fe(II) chloride solution at pH 7. 0 ('induced hydrolysis') was determined. The compound was nearly stoichiometric, with the formula FeInFe[l(OH) 12 CO 3, the Fe(II) :Fe(III) ratio being indepen-dent of the Fe(II) :Fe(III) ratio in the initial reaction mixture. It shows all the XRD peaks reported for this compound. Visible-near IR shows abroad peak at 650 nm which is ascribable to intervalence harge transfer and therefore the absorbance maximum decreases with increasing degree of oxidation. Wetting the material with compounds containing hydroxyl groups (such as glycerol or glucose) retards the oxidation of the otherwise very oxidation-sensitive compound. Similar polar organic ompounds may stabilize the Fe(II) Fe(III) hydroxy-carbonate in wet soils. The importance ofthe green rust phase as an intermediate in the formation and transformation reactions of oxides and oxyhydroxides of iron in natural environments should not be ignored. Green <b>rust</b> <b>compounds</b> are Fe(II) Fe(III) hydroxy-compounds containing {{a certain amount of}} a non-hydroxyl anion which is reported to be sulphate, bromide, fluoride (Bernal et al., 1959), chloride (Feitknecht & Keller, 1950), iodide (Vins et al., 1987). nitrate (Gancedo et al., 1983...|$|R

40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 2188 on 28. 02. 2017 by CS (TIS) The {{work in this}} thesis {{is concerned with the}} Green Rusts, which are bluegreen metastable Fe(II) - Fe(III) hydroxy compounds incorporating anions such as SO 42 -, Cl- or CO 3 -. These Green <b>Rust</b> <b>compounds</b> (or Fe-GR compounds to distinguish them from the aluminium Green Rusts (Al-GRs) which are isostructural Fe(II) - Al(III) hydroxy compounds) can be produced in a consistent fashion from Fe(II) solutions by the method of induced hydrolysis using Fe(III) gel at pH 7 and under anoxic conditions. A series of sulphate and chloride Fe-GR samples were synthesised, and characterised primarily by the analytical techniques of M 8 ssbauer spectroscopy, X-Ray diffractometry, infra-red spectroscopy, and vacuum microbalance to measure surface area using the BET N 2 adsorption method. For comparison, a few samples of the analogous Al-GR compounds were also synthesised and characterised by the analytical techniques mentioned above. The results in this thesis showed that the systems producing the Fe-GR compounds were of a highly complex nature, and that the amount of precipitate formed depended crucially on the starting conditions. For the 0. 1 M FeSO 4 system, the GR formed was almost always accompanied by a goethite phase while, for the 0. 1 M FeC 12 system, pure GR material was only formed at initial Fe(II) - Fe(III) ratios (IFFRs) greater than 6. Any-differences between__the, sulphate and chloride Fe-GRs can. be attributed to the difference in anion-type. X-Ray diffraction in conjunction with electron microscopy and surface area measurements confirm-that the Fe-GRs have a pyroaurite crystal structure, with brucite-like layers formed by a matrix of Fe 2 + and Fe 3 + cations and each layer bridged to the other by anions. As far as Messbauer spectroscopy is concerned, the most important diagnostic parameter is the quadrupole splitting (QS) of the Fe(II) doublet measured at 77 K for the wet, fresh precipitate (i. e. frozen material). For sul phate Fe-GRs derived from 0. 1 M FeSO 4 the mean QS is 2. 93 ± 0. 05 mms-', while for the chloride Fe-GRs derived from 0. 1 M FeC 12 the mean QS is 2. 80 ± 0. 05 mms- 1. Surface areas for the sulphate Fe-GRs are in the range 40 - 65 m 2. g- 1. The products of oxidation and ageing for the Fe-GRs indicate several transformation pathways, especially for the chloride Fe-GRs. Sulphate Fe-GRs converted to goethite on oxidation under both wet and dry conditions, while the chloride Fe-GRs converted to akaganeite on dry oxidation, and to lepidocrocite on wet oxidation. Under both wet and dry anoxic conditions, the chloride Fe-GRs converted to magnetite. In the case of the sulphate Fe-GRs, there was a suggestion that, under the right wet anoxic conditions, the material probably transformed into magnetite. These facts clearly demonstrate that the Fe-GRs are intermediaries in the thermodynamic transformation of Fe in the II oxidation state to Fe in the III oxidation state...|$|R

The effect of this compound on the induction of resistance was also measured by the expression of defence-related genes such as POX (peroxidase), CAT (catalase), GLU (b- 1. 3 -glucanase) and PAL (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase) and by the activity of defence enzymes such as ascorbate peroxidase (APX), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO). Foliar sprayings of MnPhi on coffee seedlings provided 63 % control of <b>rust</b> severity.

40|$|Abstract [...] In {{the absence}} of oxygen, Fe(II) chloride, sulfate, and {{carbonate}} solutions react at pH 6. 5 to 7 with aluminum hydroxide suspensions to form new Fe(II) -AI(III) hydroxy anion compounds of the py-roaurite group. The Fe(II) -AI(III) hydroxy-chloride and-sulfate compounds are isostructural with Fe(II) -Fe(III) "green <b>rust</b> " <b>compounds</b> with AI essentially substituting for Fe(III). Where CO 3 ~ is the only anion in the system, an Fe(II) -AI(III) compound isostructural with hydrotalcite is formed. Either in the dried or wet state, these compounds are unstable in air due to oxidation of Fe(II). Oxidation of the dried sample in air yields akaganeite oraluminous ferrihydrite, whereas, if the sample is maintained ina moist condition and oxidized by air under water, lepidocrocite or aluminous goethite is produced along with small amounts of ferfihydrite. On X-ray powder diffraction, the lepidocrocite so formed commonly shows no diagnostic (020) basal reflection, or one with a markedly reduced intensity. The products of oxidation, and the rapidity of their formation, appear {{to be dependent on}} the composition of the initial double hydroxy compound and the conditions under which the oxidation is carried out. The green colored compounds commonly observed in gleyed soils also rapidly become yellow brown on exposure to air, and difficulty arises in the identification of the Fe oxide phases assumed to be present. Similar conditions and reactants othose involved {{in the formation of the}} compounds described above are expected in these soils, and it is suggested that Fe(II) -AI(III) members of the pyroaurite group may form in such an environment...|$|R

A considerable {{attention has been given}} to the characteristics of the most important corrosion products formed on the steel surface.

The conditions that cause the formation and regeneration of hydrochloric and sulphuric acid during the exposure to the elements were analyzed. The most often applied methods of diagnostics and procedures of removing active corrosion anions (desalination) were described as well. The NaOH solution of certain pH values still has the most important application for the desalination process.

40|$|Dissimilatory iron-reducing {{bacteria}} (DIRB) couple the oxidation {{of organic}} matter or H 2 to the reduction of iron oxides. The factors controlling the rate and extent of these reduction reactions and the resulting solid phases are complex and poorly understood. Batch experiments were conducted with amorphous hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) and the DIRB Shewanella putrefaciens, strain CN 32, in well-defined aqueous solutions to investigate the reduction of HFO and formation of biogenic Fe(II) minerals. Lactate-HFO solutions buffered with either bicarbonate or 1, 4 -piperazinediethanesulfonic acid (PIPES) containing various combinations of phosphate and anthraquinone- 2, 6 -disulfonate (AQDS), were inoculated with S. putrefaciens CN 32. AQDS, a humic acid analog that {{can be reduced to}} dihydroanthraquinone by CN 32, was included because of its ability to function as an electron shuttle during microbial iron reduction and as an indicator of pe. Iron reduction was measured with time, and the resulting solids were analyzed by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). In HCO 3 − buffered medium with AQDS, HFO was rapidly and extensively reduced, and the resulting solids were dominated by ferrous carbonate (siderite). Ferrous phosphate (vivianite) was also present in HCO 3 − medium containing P, and fine-grained magnetite was present as a minor phase in HCO 3 − medium with or without P. In the PIPES buffered medium, the rate and extent of reduction was strongly influenced by AQDS and P. With AQDS, HFO was rapidly converted to highly crystalline magnetite whereas in its absence, magnetite mineralization was slower and the final material less crystalline. In PIPES with both P and AQDS, a green <b>rust</b> type <b>compound</b> [Fe II(6 -x) Fe III x (OH) 12] x+[(A 2 −) x/ 2 • yH 2 O]x− was the dominant solid phase formed; in the absence of AQDS a poorly crystalline product was observed. The measured pe and nature of the solids identified were consistent with thermodynamic considerations. The composition of aqueous media in which microbial iron reduction occurred strongly impacted the rate and extent of iron reduction {{and the nature of the}} reduced solids. This, in turn, can provide a feedback control mechanism on microbial metabolism. Hence, in sediments where geochemical conditions promote magnetite formation, two-thirds of the Fe(III) will be sequestered in a form that may not be available for anaerobic bacterial respiration...|$|R
30|$|Among western US conifers, {{sugar pine}} (Pinus lambertiana Douglas) is {{a species that}} has {{experienced}} an apparent shift in health due to the change in forest structure and dynamics relating to fire suppression and the invasive pathogen, {{white pine blister rust}} (Cronartium ribicola J.C. Fisch. ex Raben). Specifically, following > 100 years of fire exclusion, sugar pine experiences high mortality in response to fire, a trend displayed by most tree species within the mixed conifer forest type (Mutch and Parsons 1998, van Mantgem et al. 2004). Post-fire death of sugar pine is a management concern because the effects of blister <b>rust</b> could be <b>compounded</b> by fire or beetle outbreaks (Paine et al. 1998). There is potential for widespread mortality as observed in other white pine species because sugar pine displays moderate to low levels of genetic resistance to this pathogen, which is also continuing to evolve and overcome host resistance (Kinloch and Comstock 1981, Kinloch 1992, Kendall and Keane 2001). When populations are already weakened by blister rust, additional fire-caused mortality could potentially contribute to extirpation, especially in the face of changing climate and fire regimes (van Mantgem et al. 2004, Bigler et al. 2005, Parker et al. 2006). Positive correlations between blister rust and bark beetle activity have also raised concerns that sugar pine may be experiencing elevated levels of beetle activity prior to prescribed fire and that interactions between these pathogens may lead to elevated mortality following fire (Thomas and Agee 1986, van Mantgem et al. 2004, Kulakowski and Veblen 2007).|$|R
40|$|Selected {{isolates}} of Cladosporium tenuissimum {{were tested}} {{for their ability}} to inhibit in vitro aeciospore germination of the two-needle pine stem rusts Cronartium flaccidum and Peridermium pini and to suppress disease development in planta. The antagonistic fungus displayed a number of disease-suppressive mechanisms. Aeciospore germination on water agar slides was reduced at 12, 18, and 24 h when a conidial suspension (1. 5 x 10 (7) conidia per ml) of the Cladosporium tenuissimum isolates was added. When the aeciospores were incubated in same-strength conidial suspensions for 1, 11, 21, and 31 days, viability was reduced at 20 and 4 degreesC. Light and scanning electron microscopy showed that rust spores were directly parasitized by Cladosporium tenuissimum and that the antagonist had evolved several strategies to breach the spore wail and gain access to the underlying tissues. Penetration occurred with or without appressoria. The hyperparasite exerted a mechanical force to destroy the spore structures (spinules, cell wall) by direct contact, penetrated the aeciospores and subsequently proliferated within them. However, an enzymatic action could also be involved. This was shown by the dissolution of the host tell wall that comes in contact with the mycelium of the mycoparasite, by the lack of indentation in the host wall at the contact site, and by the minimal swelling at the infecting hyphal tip. Culture filtrates of the hyperparasite inhibited germination of <b>rust</b> propagules. A <b>compound</b> purified from the filtrates was characterized by chemical and spectroscopic analysis as cladosporol, a known beta - 1, 3 -glucan biosynthesis inhibitor. Conidia of Cladosporium tenuissimum reduced rust development on new infected pine seedlings over 2 years under greenhouse conditions. Because the fungus is an aggressive mycoparasite, produces fungicidal metabolites, and can survive and multiply in forest ecosystems without rusts, it seems a promising agent for the biological control of pine stem rusts in Europe...|$|R
40|$|A {{sustainable}} energy cycle may include enhanced utilization of solar energy and atmospheric CO 2 to produce biomass and enhanced utilization of exhaust CO 2 from power plants for synthetic gas production. The reaction of carbon with CO 2 is potentially {{one of the}} important processes in a future sustainable carbon cycle. Reactions involving carbon and CO 2 are also relevant to the chemical process and metal industries. ^ Biomass char has been recognized as a present and future alternative to fossil-fuels for energy production and fuel synthesis. Therefore, biomass char gasification with CO 2 recycling is proposed as a sustainable and carbon-neutral energy technology. Biomass char is a complex porous solid and its gasification involves heat and mass transfer processes within pores of multiple sizes from nanometer to millimeter scales. These processes are coupled with heterogeneous chemistry at the internal and external surfaces. Rates for the heterogeneous carbon gasification reactions are affected by inorganic content of the char. Furthermore, pore structure of the char develops with conversion and influences apparent gasification rates. Effective modeling of the gasification reactions has relied on the best available understanding of diffusion processes and kinetic rate property constants from state of the art experiments. Improvement of the influences of inorganic composition, and process parameters, such as pressure and temperature on the gasification reaction rates has been a continuous process. Economic viability of gasification relies on use of optimum catalysts. These aspects of the current status of gasification technologies have motivated the work reported in this dissertation. ^ The reactions between biomass chars and CO 2 are investigated {{to determine the effects of}} temperature and pressure on the reaction rates for large char particles of relevance to practical gasification technologies. An experimental apparatus consisting of a high-pressure fixed-bed reactor with product gas sampling for tracking the reaction progress, supported by independent gravimetric measurements of mass loss, is described. The effects of pressure and temperature on the char-CO 2 reaction are investigated at elevated pressures up to 10 atm. Measurements of reaction rates at multiple temperatures and pressures for a low-ash pinewood char are presented. Kinetic rate parameters for the char-CO 2 reaction are reported with detailed uncertainty calculations and discussed in the context of the structural changes of the char with mass loss. The effects of pressure and temperature on the internal mass transfer processes and the intrinsic reaction rates are assessed using Thiele analysis for non-isothermal particles with the nth order and the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic rate models. The effects of potassium, calcium and iron catalysts on the CO 2 gasification rates of an activated coconut char are investigated. A catalyst treatment method for obtaining high catalyst loadings (~ 12 wt. %) is described. The effects of the catalysts on the surface reaction rates and the activation energies are reported. The results of this study are encouraging in the context of potential future discovery of a viable low-temperature catalytic gasification process for sustainable use of biomass as a renewable energy resource. Utilization of plant based substances such as citric acid to provide higher catalytic activity and the potential for utilizing the high initial activity of iron by using <b>rust</b> proofing <b>compounds</b> for maintaining high reactivity are recommended for further development. ...|$|R
