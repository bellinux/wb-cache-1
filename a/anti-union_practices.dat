40|$|The {{last months}} of the {{outgoing}} Labour government {{and the creation of}} the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition have brought the question of the anti-union laws back into prominence. The recent, as it were 'traditional', left position on the issue is to call for the repeal of Thatcher and post-Thatcher <b>anti-union</b> laws. In <b>practice,</b> Labour left MPs and trade union leaderships have been promoting a much more limited body of technical amendments to the current legislation that would leave most of it in place. A minority view among pro-union lawyers is that what is needed is legal change to bring in a positive legal right to strike. This article argues that what is needed is neither merely the repeal of post- 1979 laws, nor a 'positive right to strike'. The basis of the argument is that below the statute law is 'common law' unlawfulness of trade unions; and that this 'common law' unlawfulness is the product of severe judicial bias in the 'leading cases' in the early 18 th and late 19 th-early 20 th centuries. I suggest that this judicial bias has an institutional basis, whose effect is that 'the rule of law' amounts to the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. Hence, any proposals for reform of the anti-union laws need to be placed {{in the context of a}} more general political counter-offensive against juridification and the judicial power. © 2011 Critique...|$|R

5000|$|The {{documentary}} {{argues that}} Wal-Mart underpays its workers, paying them {{an average of}} $17,000 per year (in 2005 dollars). According to the interviews, these wages are too low for employees to afford Wal-Mart's health insurance, so management counsels workers to apply for government programs such as Medicaid instead. Greenwald also claims that Wal-Mart hires undocumented workers for their cleanup crews, paying them well below minimum wage. Other criticisms of the retail mega-chain include Wal-Mart's <b>anti-union</b> <b>practices,</b> its negative effect on mom and pop stores and small communities, insufficient environmental protection policies, and its poor record on worker's rights in the United States and internationally. Scenes filmed abroad document factory workers in Bangladesh and China creating Wal-Mart goods {{for as little as}} 18 cents an hour. [...] One 9-year veteran of Wal-Mart testifies that he was moved to tears when he viewed the conditions in clothing manufacturing facilities in Latin America. He reported the abuses but the company did not correct them. The documentary also argues that Wal-Mart's parking lots have unusually high crime rates, a situation that could be vastly improved if the company were willing to spend the money to place cameras outside the stores.|$|E
50|$|From 1936 to 1937, the La Follette Committee {{began its}} {{assessment}} of four prominent <b>anti-union</b> <b>practices</b> which suppressed {{the advancement of}} organized laborers. The Committee’s intentions lay in preserving {{the rights of the}} worker when denied by employers, and in 1937, found industrial espionage to be a common tool employed against unions. From “motion-picture producers to steel makers,” the enormous amount of companies resorting to espionage, reported the La Follette Committee, prevented the practice of collective bargaining between companies and employees. Spies of corporations befriended victims into creating reports which they used to forewarn employers of potential strikes and assemblies. Spying, the La Follette Committee declared, weakens unions and “incites to violence, preaches strikes, inflames the hot-headed and leads the union to disaster”. Detective agencies and those utilizing industrial espionage resorted to the protection against radicalism, exposure of theft, deterrence of sabotage, and improvement of labor-management relations as justification of their actions. The Federal Union of Automobile Workers, consisting of 26,000 members in the General Motors plant in 1934, was reported as having at least several spies in the union’s executive board. Within two years, membership of the union dropped to merely 120. The Committee affirmed that through the employment of espionage, employees became subjugated to private corporations and were denied constitutional rights.|$|E
