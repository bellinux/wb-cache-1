The Austrian cavalry attacked near Péchant and cut the 10th Light Infantry to ribbons. The attack on Croix-lez-Rouveroy was repulsed and Fromentin's lines began to crumble {{in the face of}} enemy cavalry attacks. Using his best troops, Duhesme covered the withdrawal and prevented a rout. Duhesme's and some of Fromentin's men retreated to the same place that they camped the night before. Michel Ney with a squadron of French hussars struck back and captured a number of Coalition troops.|$|E

Durant had hired Lincoln in 1857 {{when he was an}} attorney to represent him in a business matter about a bridge over the Missouri. Now Lincoln was responsible for choosing the eastern terminus, and he relied on Durant's counsel. Durant advocated for Omaha, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> confident of the choice that he began buying up land in Nebraska.|$|E

In the campaign, McCarthy exaggerated Werner's age of 66, claiming that he was 73, and so allegedly too old and infirm to handle the duties of his office. Writing of Werner in Reds: McCarthyism In Twentieth-Century America, Ted Morgan wrote: [...] "Pompous and condescending, he was disliked by lawyers.

500|$|Srinivasa Sastri {{was known}} for his mastery over the English {{language}} and his oratory. As a student, he once corrected a few passages in J. C. Nesfield's English Grammar. Whenever he was on visit to the United Kingdom, Sastri was often consulted over spellings and pronunciations. His mastery over the English language was recognized by King George V, Winston Churchill, Lady Lytton and Lord Balfour who rated him amongst the five best English-language orators of the century. The Master of Balliol, Arthur Lionel Smith swore that he had never realized the beauty of the English language until he heard Sastri. while Lord Balfour remarked that listening to Srinivasa Sastri made him realise the heights to which the English language could rise. Thomas Smart conferred upon Sastri the appellation [...] "Silver Tongued Orator of the British Empire" [...] <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> called all over the United Kingdom.

500|$|Morrison and EMI {{producer}} Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract, {{and as part}} of the deal, {{the band}} agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London. Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: [...] "I found [...] in the dressing room <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so...</b> gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, [...] we got him out to the stage... The band started to play and Syd just stood there. He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down".|$|E

Brian goes to tell his teacher that he cheated, but is interrupted, as the teacher tells him Brian has inspired him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> depressed that he was planning to commit suicide. Meanwhile, Peter becomes very satisfied with his A-Team's actions, but the team fails a mission to save a local park from demolition by becoming [...] "side-tracked by idle conversation" [...] with the builders. The guilty A-Team disbands afterwards. Brian eventually cracks under the pressure of a final test and knowing he will only pass if he cheats, he decides to return home with Stewie. A shocked Lois attempts to encourage him to go back and finish the test, and eventually chases him away with a vacuum cleaner called [...] "Mr. Hoover".|$|E
500|$|For In the Zone, Spears {{worked with}} hit {{producers}} such as Bloodshy & Avant, R. Kelly, Diddy, Christopher Stewart, Moby, Guy Sigsworth and The Matrix. She first started writing songs for In the Zone during the Dream Within a Dream Tour. Spears commented about writing while touring, [...] "The {{only thing that}} was scary {{to me is that}} I didn't know if they were good. [...] You can’t trust anybody. You have to go with your feelings." [...] Spears commented that she was an autobiographical songwriter, although not to the point she felt self-exploited. Following the end of the tour, Spears invited her friend and backing vocalist Annet Artani to her home in Los Angeles. They started writing songs at the piano, and shortly after, they traveled to Lake Como in Lombardy, Italy. Among the tracks they worked on was [...] "Everytime", which Artani confirmed to be written as a response to Justin Timberlake's [...] "Cry Me a River", as well as [...] "Shine", written by Spears about her sister Jamie Lynn, which was left unfinished. Earnest recording of the album began in May 2003. Spears commented that although she did not know initially what direction she wanted to go with the album, she took time to work with different producers and to find those who she had chemistry with. The first song recorded for In the Zone was [...] "Touch of My Hand", and Spears said it [...] "really did provide a balance {{for the rest of the}} record. We just went from there." [...] Following the recording sessions for [...] "Everytime", Spears complimented Sigsworth, saying, [...] "I just basically told him exactly how I wanted the song to sound. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> amazing because there's a lot of producers you tell them things and they don't get it.
