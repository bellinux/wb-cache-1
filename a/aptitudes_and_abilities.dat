Parental dissatisfaction with available schools typically includes concerns about the school environment, the quality of academic instruction, the curriculum, bullying, and lack {{of faith in the}} school's ability to cater to their children's special needs. Some parents homeschool in order to have greater control over what and how their children are taught, to cater more adequately to an individual child's <b>aptitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>abilities,</b> to provide instruction from a specific religious or moral position, and {{to take advantage of the}} efficiency of one-to-one instruction and thus allow the child to spend more time on childhood activities, socializing, and non-academic learning.

If selected, the cadet will receive up to 40 instructional launches on the Viking conventional glider (although if the student is close to solo standard {{it is not unusual}} for this limit to be exceeded), or up to 8 hours of tuition on the Vigilant motor glider. Cadets who successfully complete either of these programmes will be awarded blue wings. Cadets who show the required <b>aptitude</b> <b>and</b> <b>ability</b> may go on to perform a solo flight and be awarded silver wings.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} a computer-based system and curriculum for teaching initial reading completely under computer control. The system and curriculum are organized so that instruction is on an individual basis with each child progressing at his own pace through a subset of materials designed to be best-suited to his particular <b>aptitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>abilities.</b> From our viewpoint there are several major reasons for developing a computer-based system for instruction in initial reading. The immediate and most obvious one is to establish the feasibility of this mode of instruction with young children, There are a number of studies in the literature on programmed instruction and some of our own research, to be described later, which indicate that computer-based reading programs can be highly effective for short periods of time, However, there have bc,en no studies in which children have received all or a large part of their reading instruction under computer control for significantly long periods of time.

40|$|CONTEXT Students enter {{undergraduate}} engineering {{degree programs}} {{with a wide}} range of mathematical knowledge, skills, <b>aptitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>abilities.</b> A significant proportion of engineering undergraduates struggle with course mathematics requirements. Student pass / fail rates in engineering maths show that QUT’s BEng students are no exception. QUT provides out-of-class support to students needing extra assistance with their maths (at point-of-need) via our STIMulate program. Difficulty dealing with the mathematics requirement of engineering courses is known both anecdotally and via a body of published research, to be a major contributor to students failing to complete their degree. PURPOSE QUT’s STIMulate program philosophy of support-for-learning embraces a social justice framework, student leadership, student-academic partnerships, peer assistance and facilitated learning. The STIMulate program has developed a series of complementary approaches to support academic success. The success of the program can be attributed in part to this combination of approaches and to a deliberate move away from the deficit model so often associated with learning support. The program has proven to be of value to large numbers of students with a range of mathematical knowledge, skills, <b>aptitudes</b> <b>and</b> <b>abilities.</b> APPROACH Since 2013 STIMulate has supported student learning in maths, science and IT at QUT. It is a service founded on sound pedagogical practice. QUT’s STIMulate program offers a multi-faceted approach of support to all coursework students (both undergraduate and postgraduate). It aims to enhance student learning, to increase capabilities and confidence in mathematical and scientific concepts, as well as to expand information technology skills and competencies. A well-developed consultation framework enables our STIMulate service to integrate with, complement and support QUT’s curriculum. STIMulate uses sophisticated planning techniques that accurately predict levels of student demand at different stages of the upcoming semester. RESULTS Evidence of the positive impact of STIMulate can be found in student grades, retention (attrition), lecturer feedback, client attendance figures and student client feedback (both anecdotal and via planned survey responses). On all measures for 2015 and 2016 (GPA, academic success, retention, attrition) students who attended STIMulate achieved better outcomes than those who did not. It is particularly pleasing to see a significant proportion of students from target equity cohorts taking advantage of our STIMulate service. CONCLUSIONS QUT’s STIMulate program offers a model of how to optimally organise and deliver support for mathematics learning. It demonstrates how academics and students can effectively partner to deliver a quality service...|$|E
