5|$|Sévérine (Bérénice Marlohe) first {{encounters}} James Bond (Daniel Craig) {{while on}} an assignment in Shanghai. She helps the mercenary Patrice (Ola Rapace) assassinate an art dealer by leading the target {{in front of}} a window. Bond confronts Patrice about his affiliations, but is unable to coerce <b>any</b> <b>answers</b> before the assassin falls out of a window to his death. Sévérine and Bond exchange a glance before she leaves the room. Bond takes the payment intended for Patrice, a token for a casino in Macau.|$|E
25|$|Still {{uncertain}} about his decision, Trevize continues {{on with the}} search for Earth along with Pelorat and a local of Gaia, advanced in Mentalics, known as Blissenobiarella (usually referred to simply as Bliss). Eventually, Trevize finds three sets of coordinates which are very old. Adjusting them for time, he realizes that his ship's computer does not list any planet {{in the vicinity of}} the coordinates. When he physically visits the locations, he discovers uncharted planets: Aurora, Solaria, and finally Melpomenia. After searching and facing different dilemmas on each planet, Trevize still has not discovered <b>any</b> <b>answers.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{ancestor}} {{worship of}} ancient Scandinavians appears to contradict another idea, i.e. that the deceased departed on a voyage {{to the realm}} of the dead, a realm which could be situated inside the mountain, {{on the other side of}} the sea, in the heavens or in the underworld. There is no logical connection between these two complexes of ideas, and scholars do not have <b>any</b> <b>answers</b> to the question whether the dead would remain for some time in the grave and later depart for the realm of the dead, what the purpose of the grave goods was, or if the ship in the barrow was to transport the deceased {{to the realm of}} the dead.|$|E

500|$|Heard by some {{listeners}} as a hymn to an other-worldly woman, for Shelton [...] "her travails seem beyond endurance, yet she radiates {{an inner}} strength, {{an ability to}} be reborn. This is Dylan at his most romantic." [...] Wilentz comments that Dylan's writing had shifted {{from the days when}} he asked questions and supplied answers. Like the verses of William Blake's [...] "Tyger", Dylan asks a series of questions about the [...] "Sad Eyed Lady" [...] but never supplies <b>any</b> <b>answers.</b>|$|E

500|$|Pokémon Black and White have {{received}} largely positive reviews by critics, having an aggregate score of 87% on Metacritic, indicating generally favorable reviews. Japanese magazine Famitsu Weekly awarded the game a perfect 40/40 score, becoming the 15th game to receive such a distinction, {{as well as}} obtaining the highest score ever given to a Pokémon video game by the publication. Game Informers Annette Gonzalez remarked that [...] "Pokémon Black and White {{do a great job}} building upon already solid features and taking them to the next level." [...] VideoGamer.com's Jamin Smith criticized the games for not innovating as much as some people would have liked, but stated that [...] "rest assured in the knowledge that Black and White are damn fine games; the best the series has to offer." [...] Official Nintendo Magazine referred to them as [...] "A beautiful refinement of a great series [...] the best Pokémon ever." [...] Nintendo Power expressed that [...] "the Pokémon series's latest pair of adventures is as addictive as ever. [...] " [...] Edge acknowledged that [...] "where next for Pokémon Black and White don't suggest <b>any</b> <b>answers,</b> but they do remind us why we'd care in the first place." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{family with}} {{control of the}} {{question}} then tries to win the round by guessing all of the remaining concealed answers, with each member giving one answer in sequence. Giving an answer not on the board, or failing to respond within the allotted time, earns one strike. If the family earns three strikes, their opponents are given one chance to [...] "steal" [...] the points for the round by guessing any remaining concealed answer; failing to do so awards the points back to the family that originally had control. <b>Any</b> <b>answers</b> on the board {{that have not been}} guessed are then revealed.|$|E
2500|$|A {{more recent}} case {{came to light}} in 2007 with [...] Bass' {{agreement}} to exhume {{the body of the}} late J.P. Richardson, Jr, more famously known as [...] "The Big Bopper". He was one of the three musicians that {{died in a plane crash}} in February 1959. His son, Jay Richardson, had never met his father and, knowing the strange controversies surrounding the plane crash, decided to contact Bass to see if he could gather <b>any</b> <b>answers.</b> Questions lingered as to whether or not Buddy Holly's gun found at the scene of the crash had been fired earlier or if Richardson had managed to survive the initial crash and simply died trying to get away. After exhumation of the body, Bass examined it using a portable X-ray system. After X-ray examination, Bass was able to come to a fairly certain conclusion: Richardson died immediately upon impact. He showed Jay Richardson the numerous breaks and fractures throughout his father's body, including his chest, skull, pelvis, and legs which inhibited ambulatory motion. All of the rumors and debates surrounding Richardson's death could finally be put to rest, and it was due largely in part to [...] Bass and his extensive knowledge of forensic anthropology.|$|E

60|$|At parting, Spindler, {{in sheer}} gratefulness, pressed her hand, and lingered so long over {{it that a}} little color sprang into the widow's brown cheek.

6000|$|When the Pole {{had been}} taken back to the vessel, and had been {{confined}} below, Mr. Gibbs, utterly unable to comprehend the motives {{of the man in}} thus rushing off to die alone amid the rigors of the polar regions, went down to talk to him.

Indeed I may be superstitious,' said Mrs. Micawber, 'but {{it appears to me}} that Mr. Micawber is destined never to receive <b>any</b> <b>answers</b> {{whatever}} to the great majority of the communications he writes. I may augur, from the silence of my family, that they object to the resolution I have taken; but I should not allow myself to be swerved from the path of duty, Mr. Copperfield, even by my papa and mama, were they still living.' ...|$|E

At the last exam Glover said that the papers he sent in were far and away the best, but that he had only done the {{difficult}} questions and hadn't sent in <b>any</b> <b>answers</b> at all to the easy ones, so that instead of coming in first he was five or six down the list. I believe myself {{he did not want to}} beat me, because if he had he would have been head of the house, and that would have been altogether too much trouble for him. Glover wanted him to go up for the last Indian Civil, and told him he was sure that he could get in if he tried, but Easton said he wasn't fond of heat and had no fancy for India." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the domain}} of Literature loftily consider'd (an accomplish'd and veteran critic in his just out work[44] now says,) '{{the kingdom of the}} Father has pass'd; the kingdom of the Son is passing; the kingdom of the Spirit begins.' Leaving the reader to chew on and extract the juice and meaning of this, I will proceed to say in melanged form what I have had brought out by the English author's essay (he {{discusses}} the poetic art mostly) on my own, real, or by him supposed, views and purports. If I give <b>any</b> <b>answers</b> to him, or explanations of what my books intend, they will be not direct but indirect and derivative. Of course this brief jotting is personal. Something very like querulous egotism and growling may break through the narrative (for I have been and am rejected by all the great magazines, carry now my 72d annual burden, and have been a paralytic for 18 years.) ...|$|E

6000|$|It must be observed, in excuse of his correspondents, {{that the}} post was then much more tardy than since Mr. Palmer's ingenious {{invention}} has taken place; and {{with respect to}} honest Dinmont in particular, as he rarely received above one letter a quarter (unless {{during the time of}} his being engaged in a law-suit, when he regularly sent to the post-town), his correspondence usually remained for a month or two sticking in the postmaster's window among pamphlets, gingerbread, rolls, or ballads, according to the trade which the said postmaster exercised. Besides, there was then a custom, not yet wholly obsolete, of causing a letter from one town to another, perhaps within the distance of thirty miles, perform a circuit of two hundred miles before delivery; which had the combined advantage of airing the epistle thoroughly, of adding some pence to the revenue of the post-office, and of exercising the patience of the correspondents. Owing to these circumstances Brown remained several days in Allonby without <b>any</b> <b>answers</b> whatever, and his stock of money, though husbanded with the utmost economy, began to wear very low, when he received by the hands of a young fisherman the following letter:-- ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was in a}} might good humour when {{he heard}} me say I had paid her, and it went off into some other {{discourse}} at that time. But the next morning, he having heard me up about my room before him, he called to me, and I answering, {{he asked me to}} come into his chamber. He was in bed when I came in, and he made me come and sit down on his bedside, for he said he had something to say to me which was of some moment. After some very kind expressions, he asked me if I would be very honest to him, and give a sincere answer to one thing he would desire of me. After some little cavil at the word 'sincere,' and asking him if I had ever given him <b>any</b> <b>answers</b> which were not sincere, I promised him I would. Why, then, his request was, he said, to let him see my purse. I immediately put my hand into my pocket, and, laughing to him, pulled it out, and there was in it three guineas and a half. Then he asked me if there was all the money I had. I told him No, laughing again, not by a great deal.|$|E
60|$|The animals {{which appear}} {{to support the}} hard work and {{irregular}} food with the least deterioration are the bullocks. Of these {{a very small number}} indeed have been ill, and the deaths amount to only one or two weekly. They look in really good condition, and perform their work admirably. Indeed, the greater part of the mules and ponies look in fair condition, and they have certainly no lack of food, except at the up-stations. Very great credit is due to the commissariat department, who have done very well, and against whom one never hears a complaint. Since the first landing they have had an abundance of stores for the men; and no instance has, as far as I have heard, occurred of men being unable to obtain their proper rations. The Commander-in-chief is making every effort to strengthen the transport train, and has gazetted a number of unattached subalterns for it. He has also, I believe, applied to the native regiments here for volunteers for that corps; among the subalterns, I hear, there have been few, if <b>any,</b> <b>answers</b> in the affirmative. I understand that the European regiments have also been applied to for volunteers among the noncommissioned officers and men, to act as inspectors in the train. Among these, as among the officers, I hear the appeal has not been responded to. The work of the train is tremendously hard; and men fancy, and perhaps with reason, that they have less chance of going forward to the front in the train than they would have in their own regiments. There would have been no difficulty originally in obtaining any number of men from the regiments not coming to Abyssinia, as men would have volunteered for the very reason that makes the men here refuse to do so—namely, that they wished to see the war; in addition to which, as I have said, the pay in the train is really very good.|$|E
