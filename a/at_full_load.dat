5|$|According to the {{benchmarks}} on {{its official}} website, the Fastra II is {{faster and more}} power efficient than its competitors, including the Fastra I and the Tesla C1060 video card. The benchmarks were performed on the Fastra II, the Fastra I, a 512-core cluster (consisting of Opteron CPUs), an Nvidia Tesla C1060 workstation card on an Intel Core i7 940 CPU, and on an Intel Core i7 940 CPU itself. The Fastra II is over three {{times faster than the}} Fastra I in CT slice reconstruction speed. Although the Fastra II consumes more power than the Fastra I, it's nearly 3 times as energy efficient as the Fastra I, and over 300 times as energy efficient as the 512-core cluster. The video cards run at 37 degrees Celsius when idle, and at 60 degrees Celsius <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>load.</b>|$|E

25|$|The heat {{absorbed by}} the {{circulating}} cooling water in the condenser tubes must also be removed to maintain {{the ability of the}} water to cool as it circulates. This is done by pumping the warm water from the condenser through either natural draft, forced draft or induced draft cooling towers (as seen in the adjacent image) that reduce the temperature of the water by evaporation, by about 11to17°C (20to30°F)—expelling waste heat to the atmosphere. The circulation flow rate of the cooling water in a 500 MW unit is about 14.2 m³/s (500ft³/s or 225,000 US gal/min) <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>load.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{many ways}} Avance resembled the first {{state-owned}} icebreaker of Finland, Murtaja, although her bow was of improved Swedish design which increased her icebreaking capability. The {{angle of the}} stem, {{the first part of}} the ship to encounter and break the ice, was 22 degrees. Still, she was of the same outdated European design as Murtaja and thus had similar problems in difficult ice conditions. Her coal stores were also located too far in the front, resulting in an unfavourable trim <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>load.</b> Despite her shortcomings Avance was found out to be suitable for service within the archipelago.|$|E

25|$|The {{sea trials}} on 23–26 March 1890 were {{witnessed}} {{by a group}} of experts, among them the Finnish-Swedish arctic explorer Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld, the first person to complete a voyage through the Northern Sea Route. During these trials Murtaja passed {{all but one of the}} tests for performance and general seaworthiness. Her draught <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>load</b> exceeded the contract specification by , meaning that either her specialized hull form could not be fully utilized in icebreaking or the coal capacity would have to be reduced, affecting her range and endurance. However, the shipyard promised to do everything it could to reduce the draught of the vessel to an acceptable level and Murtaja, the largest and most powerful European icebreaker at that time, was delivered to the owner on 30 March 1890. She left the shipyard on the following day and headed to Helsinki, where she was welcomed by a large cheering crowd on 2 April 1890.|$|E
25|$|On October 23, 1891 a {{group of}} {{entrepreneurs}} obtain a 10-year permit to build the Edmonton Electric Lighting and Power Company {{on the banks of}} the North Saskatchewan River. The Edmonton Electrical Lighting and Power Company became a municipally owned electric utility in 1902, then the Electrical Distribution and Power Plant departments combined to form Edmonton Power in 1970. Electrical generation capacity was also expanded in 1970 with the coal fired Clover Bar Generating Station construction. Within the next eight years, another three units are added, bringing the combined generating capacity of the Clover bar and Rossdale generating stations to 1050 megawatts by 1979. Expansion occurred again in 1989 with the first Genesee unit is operating <b>at</b> <b>full</b> <b>load</b> and in 1994 with a second Genesee unit to a total capacity of both units to 850 megawatts. Electricity generated at Genesee was made commercially available through the Alberta Interconnected Grid in the early 1990s. EPCOR was formed from the merger of Edmonton's municipal natural gas, power and water utilities in 1996 and converted into a public company in 2006. Then EPCOR Utilities Inc. spun off its power generation business to create Capital Power Corporation in 2009.|$|E
