Further the dissertation is aimed at acquirement of an extracurricular activities outline in selected elementary schools for the <b>aurally</b> <b>handicapped</b> and at disclosure of <b>aurally</b> <b>handicapped</b> children's interest to seize the offer. The theoretical part gives information about aural handicap, further there are characterized conditions of an <b>aurally</b> <b>handicapped</b> child's development and a personality, there are described ways of communication and a brief outline of care of the <b>aurally</b> <b>handicapped</b> in our country. The theoretical part end describes general information of content, forms and educational institutions besides lessons. The practical part includes factual inquiry and basic information about examined schools for the <b>aurally</b> <b>handicapped</b> in the Czech Republic. For checking the given preconditions a method of questionnaires will be used. In the dissertation end all the acquired facts will be summarized...|$|E
40|$|A midwife {{working in}} the {{delivery}} room can get into a situation where communicating with an aurally impaired pregnant woman and effectively educating her becomes essential. Pregnancy and birth represent considerable stress, whether physical or mental, for the organism of every woman. Owing to more complicated communication, <b>aurally</b> <b>handicapped</b> women in particular are subject to increased fear and distress. The theoretical part of the thesis focuses on the question of physiological pregnancy and birth as well as the specification of aural disability and educational process. The differences in care for pregnant and birthing women in the Czech Republic and Germany are mentioned {{at the end of the}} theoretical part. Studying aural disability more consistently as well as possible contradictions and consequences of insufficient communication during pregnancy, birth and subsequent care for the newborn between the staff and the aurally impaired woman enables a more professional view, thus contributing to a better level of prevention of the woman?s physical and mental problems. The empirical part of the thesis aims at finding out the skills and knowledge of the ways of communication and education of midwives within their work responsibilities as far as <b>aurally</b> <b>handicapped</b> women are concerned. The research also consists of deeper understanding of the area where the necessary educational process should be aimed from the point of view of aurally impaired women?s needs. Quantitative and qualitative research methods were used to get and process data for the empiric part. The quantitative research survey was carried out through the method of data collection by a questionnaire for midwives {{working in the}} delivery room. The qualitative part of the research survey was carried out via framework analysis of the output gained from half-structured interviews conducted with <b>aurally</b> <b>handicapped</b> women. Identifying the communication skills of midwives with aurally impaired women in the obstetrics can result in the optimization of the mutual cooperation between a client and the nursing staff. Upon the learnt facts, the thesis points put potential problems in the area of education of <b>aurally</b> <b>handicapped</b> women. At the same time, suitable communication and education strategies are recommended within the professional powers of a midwife in the area of informing <b>aurally</b> <b>handicapped</b> women about pregnancy and birth...|$|E
40|$|The study, {{based on}} L. Cronbach's Characteristics by Treatment Interaction model, {{investigated}} seven preschool programs for <b>aurally</b> <b>handicapped</b> children which variously employed the oral-aural method, the Rochester method, or the total communication method. Equipment, materials, grouping procedures, and activities were indicated for each program. Programs were compared for degree of parent involvement, adequacy of facilities and personnel, administrative organization of services, pupil populations, {{and degree of}} program structure. One hundred and two children from the programs were selected as the sample population. Data were reported from the Leiter Performance Test, the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities, classroom observation, communication analysis, pupil records, the Brown Parent Attitude Scale, and a semantic differential measuring parent attitudes towards concept...|$|E

40|$|In {{my thesis}} I am {{focusing}} {{on the issue of}} marketing communication tools in the area of non-profit organizations dealing with social services. The thesis is divided into two parts; the first one is theoretical and there are explained basic terms, legal framework and contemporary situation in the non-profit sector in the Czech Republic. Last but not least, in this part I am trying to evaluate the most suitable marketing communication strategies for the development of social services and the improvement of their quality through non-profit organizations. The second part is focused on a practical analysis of marketing activities of the citizen-action public Camino. Its goal is to arrange information and create special cultural and educational programs for <b>aurally</b> <b>handicapped.</b> The aim of the case study is to apply theoretical preconditions on a particular citizen-action public. This enables me to connect theoretical and practical knowledge relating to this issue. I am trying to suggest possible improvements and create a new marketing conception for this association...|$|E
40|$|In {{order for}} the hearing {{handicapped}} child to derive maximum benefit of language acquisition through maturation, a method of receptive communication is essential at the earliest age possible. It is felt that speechreading is this method. The need for a method of training speechreading cues to prelingual, <b>aurally</b> <b>handicapped</b> children {{is based on the}} fact that most visual speechreading methods require the use of language. If speechreading can be regarded as a learning process involving the discrimination of visual cues that maybe disassociated from language expression then training the child to discriminate various facial expressions may actually enhance speech-reading ability. If such a training method proved to be highly connected with speechreading learning, then it also might prove useful in helping the deaf pre-school child acquire the necessary attentive and discriminitive behaviors consistent with speechreading. Ten pre-school, normal hearing children participated in an oral-gestural training program which was carried out in three parts: 1) Administration of the revised Children 2 ̆ 7 s Speechreading Test, 2) Training for discrimination of oral-gestural pairs as 2 ̆ 2 same 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 different 2 ̆ 2 until a 100 percent correct response criterion had been obtained, 3) Evaluation of the oral-gestural training through readministration of the revised Children 2 ̆ 7 s Speechreading Test. A t-test of the difference between the baseline mean and post training speechreading mean revealed significance beyond the. 05 level of confidence. This supported the original proposal that speechreading skills for propositional words can be acquired by means of visual discrimination training in oral-facial movements. It is thus proposed that such training will prove useful in helping the hearing handicapped preschool child acquire the necessary behaviors consistent with speechreadlng, namely attention and visual discrimination. This study involved normal hearing subjects in which language was already established. Since the Oral-Gestural Training program is designed for the hearing handicapped prelingual child, further investigation with such a population appears necessary to confirm the findings of this investigation. Other questions that arose during the study such as sex and age differences of a larger sample, and the significance of the number of oral-gestural training sessions as related to the post-training test score, are other related areas that need consideration before a final conclusion can be drawn. Although no formal data was obtained on attention span, it was observed subjectively that this capacity improved markedly among these subjects. This is a clinical observation and should be subjected to further investigation. In conclusion, it appears through the findings of this study, that such a training method may be highly related with speechreading training and may indeed prove useful in helping prelingual, <b>aurally</b> <b>handicapped</b> children acquire the necessary behaviors consistent with speechreading...|$|E
