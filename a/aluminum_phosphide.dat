50|$|Acute {{aluminium}} phosphide poisoning (AAlPP) is a large, though under-reported, problem throughout the world, {{particularly in the}} Indian subcontinent. Aluminium phosphide (AlP), which is readily available as a fumigant for stored cereal grains, sold under various brand names such as QuickPhos and Celphos, is highly toxic, especially when consumed from a freshly opened container. Death results from profound shock, myocarditis and multi-organ failure. Aluminium phosphide has a fatal dose of between 0.15 and 0.5 g. It {{has been reported to}} be {{the most common cause of}} suicidal death in North India. Deaths have also been reported in Iran. In January 2017, four children died at a trailer park in Amarillo, Texas, after the pesticide was used under the home to kill rats.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{innovative}} device designed and constructed {{to improve the}} fumigation process for stored foodstuffs {{with the use of}} phosphine gas in sealed chambers. The device allowed a considerable reduction in phosphine production time (from about 5 to 7 days for traditional systems to 2 days for the equipment considered), maintaining the system below the inflammability threshold, {{and at the same time}} achieving the total exhaustion of <b>aluminum</b> (or magnesium) <b>phosphide</b> so as to avoid toxic residues at the end of the process. With the standard device currently available on the market, after the normal 5 – 7 day fumigating period, the powder residue contains as much as 1 – 2 % (w/w) of phosphide. Thus the residues, according to current legislation, have to be considered toxic and harmful. To overcome this disadvantage, appropriate modifications were made to the cylindrical tray used for the fumigation process: a nebulizer was installed, which has the function of increasing the moisture of the air spreading around the phosphide pellets and allowing a more rapid reaction with phosphide. Moreover, the cylindrical tray was also heated by means of an electrical resistance, and temperature was checked by a thermostat, so as to always obtain the same efficiency, independently of outside temperature, for both hot and cold periods, since reaction speed depends on the system temperature considered. In addition, a control device for air saturation allows condensation processes to be avoided. Using the modified cylindrical tray we performed tests to determine the best values of humidity and temperature for the process concerned, avoiding phosphine concentrations that might result in a fire hazard, and the remixing of phosphide pellets inside the cylindrical tray. Our experimental data allowed us to obtain a mathematical model used to gain an insight into the process in question...|$|R

40|$|This Alert {{describes}} 205 {{cases of}} illness or injury in workers exposed to phosphine gas associated with phosphide fumigants. Information about these exposures is urgently needed by agricultural workers, employers, cooperative extension agents, physicians, {{and other health}} care providers. NIOSH therefore requests that editors of trade journals, safety and health officials, labor unions, and agricultural employers bring this Alert to the attention of all workers who handle products that generate phosphine gas. Phosphide fumigants release toxic phosphine gas (PH 3) when they contact moisture in the air. When phosphine is inhaled, it can react with moisture in the lungs to form phosphoric acid, which can cause blistering and edema. These effects can be serious or fatal. Exposure to phosphine has also been linked with other effects such as chest tightness, headache, dizziness, and nausea. Also, improper handling of <b>aluminum</b> and magnesium <b>phosphide</b> has caused injuries from flash fires and explosions. In 1988, NIOSH published survey results showing that worker exposure to phosphine often substantially exceeded the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) permissible exposure limit (PEL) [Zaebst et. al. 1988]. The case reports described in this Alert clearly illustrate the hazards to workers who handle or work near phosphide fumigants. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 Cover title. "September 1999 " [...] P. [2] of cover.

40|$|Freezing changes sperm {{integrity}} remarkably. Cryopreservation involves cooling, freezing, and thawing and {{all these}} contribute to structural damage in sperm, resulting in reduced fertility potential. Low-level laser irradiation (LLLI) could increase energy supply to the cell and cause reactive oxygen species reduction (ROS), contributing to the restoration of oxygen consumption and adenosine triphosphate synthesis (ATP) in the mitochondria. Our goal was to analyze the effects of low-level laser irradiation on sperm motility and integrity of the plasma membrane and acrosome in cryopreserved bovine sperm. We analyzed 09 samples of bull semen (Bos taurus indicus), divided into three groups: a control group without laser irradiation, a 4 J group subjected to a laser irradiation dose of 4 joules, and a 6 J group subjected to dose of 6 joules. Samples were divided {{for the analysis of}} cell viability and acrosomal membrane integrity using flow cytometry; another portion was used for motion analysis. Irradiation was performed in petri dishes of 30 mm containing 3 ml of semen by an <b>aluminum</b> gallium indium <b>phosphide</b> laser diode with a wavelength of 660 nm, 30 mW power, and energy of 4 and 6 joules for 80 and 120 seconds respectively.

Flow cytometry showed an increase in the percentage of live sperm cells and acrosome integrity in relation to control cells when subjected to irradiation of low-power laser in two different doses of 4 and 6 joules (p < 0. 05). In the analysis of straightness, percentage of cell movement, and motility, a dose of 4 joules was more effective (p < 0. 05).

40|$|In this work, {{we examine}} {{fundamental}} materials {{processes in the}} growth of indium gallium phosphide (InGaP) via metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). In particular, we realize improvements in the epitaxial integration of high-quality InGaP device materials on non-standard platforms, such as GeSi graded buffers orSi substrates, and InGaP or indium <b>aluminum</b> gallium <b>phosphide</b> (InAlGaP) graded buffers on GaP substrates. We apply these improvements to the design and implementation of strained-InGaP quantum-well light emitting diodes (LEDs) operating in the yellow-green region of the visible spectrum. The innovative use of these traditional materials is intended to provide a solution for bright green solid-state light emitters. Initial modes of InGaP lattice-matched epitaxy on GeSi were studied. Three- dimensional growth was observed over a wide range of deposition temperatures and V/III ratios. Pre-growth thermal cycling in a H 2 plus PH 3 ambient led to a large increase in surface roughness and the formation of surface mesas. Thermodynamic simulations suggest that these mesas may be P clusters or GeP solid complexes. They may also be surface oxides formed in conjunction with water vapor in the deposition chamber. Such surface degradation prior to the initiation of epitaxy is unfavorable for monolayer growth. The development and evolution of defect microstructures in relaxed, compositionally graded InGaP buffers deposited on GaP were examined. In particular, the properties of branch defects in InGaP graded buffers were examined for a large number of growth and annealing conditions. (cont.) These studies confirm that branch defect formation is driven by surface, not bulk, processes. Branch defects in the bulk arise from surface features that are metastably "frozen" in place by subsequent deposition and propagate through the thickness of the sample. We conclude that branch defects comprise a local compositional fluctuation resulting from the clustering of In atoms. This identification is supported by the suppression of branch defect formation under conditions of reduced adatom mobility, including low growth temperature and high V/III ratio. In addition, we demonstrate that dislocations gliding in the [110] direction are -preferentially blocked by strain fields arising from nearly-[110]-oriented branch defects. This is further evidence for the link between branch defects and In clustering. A relaxed InAlGaP graded buffer platform was utilized in the design and fabrication of a novel strained-InGaP quantum-well epitaxial-transparent-substrate LED (ETS-LED). The best devices exhibited yellow-green emission with a primary wavelength of 590 nm and a secondary wavelength of 560 nm. These devices had [rho]TD = 7 x 106 cm 2 and an In 0. 32 Ga 0. 68 P quantum well active region, and operated at 0. 18 [mu]W per facet at 20 mA, corresponding to a luminous efficacy of approximately 0. 01 1 m/W.

40|$|In this project, we {{implement}} modern metal {{organic chemical}} vapor deposition (MOCVD) technology to fabricate monolithic platforms which integrate traditionally incompatible materials with {{the ultimate goal of}} achieving high brightness green to amber light emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes (LDs). Unconventional compositions of <b>aluminum</b> indium gallium <b>phosphide</b> (AlInGaP), with lattice constants less than that of GaAs, offer improved electrical and optical characteristics over commonly used GaAsmatched material. Also, integration of optical III-V material on the CMOS platform has long been a technological goal, and these compositions of AlInGaP are amenable to monolithic integration on the (100) Si platform. In this thesis, we pioneer technology to integrate high quality, novel AlInGaP alloys on III-V substrates (and elsewhere, this technology is successfully extended for III-V integration on (100) Si). We first focus on creating a virtual substrate upon which any lattice constant intermediate to GaAs and GaP is available. Large amounts of lattice mismatch are ultimately relaxed through incremental introduction of strain in compositionally graded epitaxial layers, thus breaking the typical lattice-matched constraint of semiconductor systems. Tensile relaxed gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP) graded layers yield virtual substrates with extremely low threading defect densities ([rho]t= 104 cm- 2), while extremely thin, 1. 3 [mu]m compressively graded GaAsP buffers also yield low thread densities ([rho]t= 105 cm- 2). The lack of phase separation defects along with the atomically smooth nature of the tensile films leads to suppression of dislocation nucleation and efficient dislocation glide which together facilitate complete strain relaxation with minimal escalation of [rho]t. (cont.) Next we present microstructural studies of AlInGaP lattice-matched to these virtual substrates. Atomic mechanisms of formation of defects including CuPt-B atomic order, phase separation defects and GaAsP surface undulation are understood. A competitive two-step model which describes their creation at the growth surface and subsequent destruction in a high diffusivity subsurface layer makes possible intuitive adjustment of MOCVD growth parameters for defect-free AlInGaP heterostructures. Finally, fabrication of LEDs is discussed. As predictions show, electroluminescence color ranges from green (570 nm) to amber (606 nm). These structures hold promise for LDs and high efficiency LEDs at wavelengths as low as 550 nm. by Michael James Mori. Thesis (Ph. D.)
