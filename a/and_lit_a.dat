5|$|News of the {{armistice}} on 11 November 1918 reached Southern Rhodesia the same day, and was {{announced to the}} town of Salisbury by the repeated blowing of the klaxon at the Castle Brewery. Hysterical street parties started almost immediately, and in the evening the people let off fireworks <b>and</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> huge bonfire on Salisbury kopje. Bulawayo celebrated with a street party that continued uninterrupted for over 48 hours. Smaller towns marked {{the armistice}} with their own celebratory functions and events.|$|E
5|$|On August 13, 2013, Booker was {{declared}} {{the winner of}} the Democratic primary, with approximately 59% of the vote. On October 16, 2013, he defeated Republican Steve Lonegan in the general election 55% to 44%, making him the first African-American U.S. Senator from New Jersey and the first African-American to be elected to the Senate since Barack Obama in 2004. The night before his victory, Booker visited the gravesite of Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, where he offered his prayers <b>and</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> vigil in memory of his father.|$|E
25|$|As in Olympic opening ceremonies, a torch bearer (Soviet runner and 1980 gold {{medalist}} Viktor Markin) carried the flame into the stadium <b>and</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> giant bowl {{which had been}} built for the 1980 Moscow Olympics. The torch had been lit from an eternal flame for World War II victims located in the Kremlin.|$|E

25|$|Realizing how {{the battle}} of San Mateo would be lost if the main house {{remained}} {{in the hands of}} the royalists, Captain Ricaurte ordered his men to leave <b>and</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> barrel of gunpowder inside one of the ammunition storage facilities of the main house, thus killing himself and a large number of the royalist troops who were readily occupying the precincts. During the momentary disorder which followed the explosion, Bolívar seized the opportunity and launched an attack to regain control of the main house and later the whole of the estate.|$|E
2500|$|In the documentary, [...] "Natascha Kampusch: 3096 days in captivity", Kampusch {{sympathized with}} her captor. She said [...] "I feel {{more and more}} sorry for him—he's a poor soul", {{in spite of the}} fact that he held her captive for eight years. According to police she [...] "cried inconsolably" [...] when she was told he was dead, <b>and</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> candle for him at the morgue. She has, however, {{referred}} to her captor as a [...] "criminal".|$|E
2500|$|On a third occasion, {{he tried}} to escape a camp by {{climbing}} its fences in broad daylight. He became entangled in barbed wire when he fell down between the two fences. When a prison guard pointed a pistol at his head and threatened to shoot, Upham calmly ignored him <b>and</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> cigarette. This scene was photographed by the Germans as [...] "evidence" [...] and later reprinted in his biography (Mark of the Lion, by Kenneth Sandford).|$|E

2500|$|The {{cauldron}} was lit by Aboriginal athlete Cathy Freeman, {{a decision}} {{that was at the}} time reported as being a [...] "bold political and social statement". Freeman was the first competing athlete to light the Olympic cauldron. Two elements from the torch concept, fire and water, were replicated {{in the design of the}} cauldron. Freeman stood atop a pool of water <b>and</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> flame that surrounded her. Though a computer glitch delayed proceedings for a few minutes the Flame then lifted around Freeman.|$|E
2500|$|On March 23, Bill Black, Scotty Moore and D.J. Fontana, {{the members}} of Elvis's band, visited Perkins {{on their way to}} New York to appear with Presley the next day. Fontana {{recalled}} Perkins saying, [...] "Of all the people, I looked up and there you guys are. You looked like a bunch of angels coming to see me." [...] Black told him, [...] "Hey man, Elvis sends his love", <b>and</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> cigarette for him, even though the patient in the next bed was in an oxygen tent. A week later, Perkins was given a telegram from Presley (which had arrived on March 23), wishing him a speedy recovery.|$|E
2500|$|By December, {{occupiers}} {{had begun}} to divert their energies beyond protest camps and a narrow focus on the banks, instead seeking to engage further with mainstream politics and joining forces with established activist groups to support causes broadly compatible {{with the interests of}} [...] "the 99%". Interviewing one of the informal leaders of the movement, Financial Times journalist Shannon Bond found that issues of concern included: [...] "the unemployment rate, household debt, student debt, the lack of prospects for people graduating from college and foreclosures." [...] In the U.S., Occupy Homes joined with other existing human rights activists groups and began to occupy foreclosed homes, disrupt bank auctions, and block evictions. [...] On 1 December, two evicted activists in Portland, Oregon, planted a table on the plaza of Portland's City Hall <b>and</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> candle, igniting a Prayer Vigil/Occupation of City Hall that lasted 18 months. On 22 December The Washington Post reported that some of the cities which had forcefully disbanded occupy camps were now facing legal challenges.|$|E

2500|$|The longest US [...] "re-occupation" [...] {{started on}} 1 December 2011, when evicted activists from the Occupy Portland camp {{set up a}} table on the plaza of Portland's City Hall <b>and</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> candle, igniting the 24/7 Prayer Vigil to Lift the Camping Ban, {{referring}} to the city's anti-"camping" [...] ordinances that were cited during the eviction. The activists claimed the laws, which prohibit the use of [...] "bedding, sleeping bags, or other sleeping matter," [...] are immoral and that they're obligated to challenge them. The occupiers claim that sleep is human right and is essential for mental, physical and emotional health, citing that human beings need to spend {{nearly a third of}} their lives sleeping. Prohibiting sleep by making it illegal for people to protect themselves and their belongings from the elements causes sleep deprivation; it is inhumane, unconstitutional, and amounts to torture. The activists said the prayer vigil would continue until [...] "bedding matter" [...] was again legal. [...] The vigil was staffed around the clock until 23 July 2013, when Mayor Charlie Hales ordered the removal of the vigil and associated encampments on the abutting sidewalks.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{artefacts}} {{depicting the}} story include {{the chest of}} Cypselus described in the travelogue by Pausanias. Among its many carvings [...] "there is a grotto and in it a woman sleeping with a man upon a couch. I was of opinion that they were Odysseus and Circe, basing my view upon {{the number of the}} handmaidens in front of the grotto and upon what they are doing. For the women are four, and they are engaged on the tasks which Homer mentions in his poetry. The passage in question describes how one of them [...] "threw linen covers over the chairs and spread fine purple fabrics on top. Another drew silver tables up to the chairs, and laid out golden dishes, while a third mixed sweet honeyed wine in a silver bowl, and served it in golden cups. The fourth fetched water <b>and</b> <b>lit</b> <b>a</b> roaring fire beneath a huge cauldron." [...] This suggests a work of considerable detail, while the Etruscan [...] coffin preserved in Orvieto's archaeological museum has only four figures. At the centre Osysseus threatens Circe with drawn sword while an animal headed figure stands on either side, one of them laying his hand familiarly on the hero's shoulder. A bronze mirror relief in the Fitzwilliam Museum is also Etruscan and is inscribed with the names of the characters. There a pig is depicted at Circe's feet, while Odysseus and Elpenor approach her, swords drawn.|$|E
