40|$|<b>Assembly,</b> <b>handling</b> and {{dispensing}} {{systems for}} small-scale parts play {{an essential part}} in reducing the cost of these products. These operations require both long coarse positioning for transfer between operations as well as dispensing as well as fine short range positioning on the submicron level for feature assembly. Typical prismatic rolling guide-way based positioning stages with ballscrew drives are to inaccurate for positioning in the submicron level {{which led to the}} development of dual stage positioning systems [1]. One stage performs the coarse long-range motions whereas another stage provides small precise motions. One disadvantage of such systems is that each actuator requires individual motion feedback, which leads to higher system cost. Focus of this paper is the design of a positioning stage that uses a dual stage approach for coarse and fine positioning, but utilizes a single two-dimensional optical grating interferometer as position feedback for the resultant motion feedback. This results in significant reduction in error sources and measurement uncertainties due to misalignment and measurement system errors...|$|E

40|$|The Assembly Transfer System (ATS) receives, cools, {{and opens}} rail and truck {{transportation}} casks from the Carrier/Cask Handling System (CCHS). The system unloads transportation casks consisting of bare Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) assemblies, single element canisters, and Dual Purpose Canisters (DPCs). For casks containing DPCs, the system opens the DPCs and unloads the SNF. The system stages the assemblies, transfer assemblies {{to and from}} fuel-blending inventory pools, loads them into Disposal Containers (DCs), temporarily seals and inerts the DC, decontaminates the DC and transfers it to the Disposal Container Handling System. The system also prepares empty casks and DPCs for off-site shipment. Two identical Assembly Transfer System lines are provided in the Waste Handling Building (WHB). Each line operates independently to handle the waste transfer throughput and to support maintenance operations. Each system line primarily consists of wet and dry handling areas. The wet handling area includes a cask transport system, cask and DPC preparation system, and a wet <b>assembly</b> <b>handling</b> system. The basket transport system forms the transition between the wet and dry handling areas. The dry handling area includes the dry <b>assembly</b> <b>handling</b> system, assembly drying system, DC preparation system, and DC transport system. Both the wet and dry handling areas are controlled by the control and tracking system. The system operating sequence begins with moving transportation casks to the cask preparation area. The cask preparation operations consist of cask cavity gas sampling, cask venting, cask cool-down, outer lid removal, and inner shield plug lifting fixture attachment. Casks containing bare SNF (no DPC) are filled with water {{and placed in the}} cask unloading pool. The inner shield plugs are removed underwater. For casks containing a DPC, the cask lid(s) is removed, and the DPC is penetrated, sampled, vented, and cooled. A DPC lifting fixture is attached and the cask is placed into the cask unloading pool. In the cask unloading pool the DPC is removed from the cask and placed in an overpack and the DPC lid is severed and removed. Assemblies are removed from either an open cask or DPC and loaded into assembly baskets positioned in the basket staging rack in the assembly unloading pool. A method called ''blending'' is utilized to load DCs with a heat output of less than 11. 8 kW. This involves combining hotter and cooler assemblies from different baskets. Blending requires storing some of the hotter fuel assemblies in fuel-blending inventory pools until cooler assemblies are available. The assembly baskets are then transferred from the basket staging rack to the <b>assembly</b> <b>handling</b> cell and loaded into the assembly drying vessels. After drying, the assemblies are removed from the assembly drying vessels and loaded into a DC positioned below the DC load port. After installation of a DC inner lid and temporary sealing device, the DC is transferred to the DC decontamination cell where the top area of the DC, the DC lifting collar, and the DC inner lid and temporary sealing device are decontaminated, and the DC is evacuated and backfilled with inert gas to prevent prolonged clad exposure to air. The DC is then transferred to the Disposal Container Handling System for lid welding. In another cask preparation and decontamination area, lids are replaced on the empty transportation casks and DPC overpacks, the casks and DPC overpacks are decontaminated, inspected, and transferred to the Carrier/Cask Handling System for shipment off-site. All system equipment is designed to facilitate manual or remote operation, decontamination, and maintenance. The system interfaces with the Carrier/Cask Handling System for incoming and outgoing transportation casks and DPCs. The system also interfaces with the Disposal Container Handling System, which prepares the DC for loading and subsequently seals the loaded DC. The system support interfaces are the Waste Handling Building System and other internal WHB support systems...|$|E
40|$|Robotics is {{the science}} and {{technology}} of designing, building and using industrial and service robots. Industrial robots were first used on a production line in 1962. Today, they are {{more than one million}} in number, the principal applications being welding, <b>assembly,</b> <b>handling,</b> machining, paint-spraying and gluing. The 1980 s witnessed the first uses of robots outside the area of industrial production, particularly in applications in which the respective task could not be executed manually because it was unacceptable or too dangerous for a human to perform or because the required accuracy and/or force could not be achieved by manual means. Robots of this type are known as service robots. Nowadays, service robots are at work cleaning buildings and roads or monitoring public areas, such as museums. Ever more robots are being used to carry out hazardous maintenance and inspection operations in industry, local authorities and the energy sector. At the personal and domestic level, robots are increasingly finding applications as robot vacuum cleaners, automated lawnmowers and toy robots. These personal robots may be early examples of future systems which will do useful jobs and assist humans in everyday environments...|$|E

The marketing system is considered to involve physical <b>assembly,</b> <b>handling,</b> storage, transport, processing, wholesaling, and retailing of agricultural products, together with services directly supporting these activities, such as market information, establishment of grades and standards, financing of marketing activities, and price risk management.

For each of these they briefly discuss the major characteristics {{of supply and demand}} that affect market structures and prospects for growth in domestic demand being supplied by domestic smallholder farmers. This leads on to examination of different marketing systems that have developed for these products in different contexts, and consideration of the effectiveness of these systems in supporting growth and serving the interests of poor consumers and producers. Specific issues around problems of price instability and risk management are considered for cereals, and new opportunities arising from the spread of information and communication technologies examined. The paper concludes with discussion of the opportunities and constraints for small scale farmers engaging with these marketing systems, and of policies to support small farmer engagement...|$|E
