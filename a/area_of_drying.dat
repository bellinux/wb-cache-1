500|$|In deserts, lack {{of ground}} and plant {{moisture}} {{that would normally}} provide evaporative cooling can lead to intense, rapid solar heating of the lower layers of air. The hot air is less dense than surrounding cooler air. This, combined with the rising of the hot air, results in a low-pressure area called a thermal low. [...] Monsoon circulations are caused by thermal lows which form over large areas of land and their strength is driven by how land heats more quickly than the surrounding nearby ocean. [...] This generates a steady wind blowing toward the land, bringing the moist near-surface air over the oceans with it. [...] Similar rainfall {{is caused by the}} moist ocean-air being lifted upwards by mountains, surface heating, convergence at the surface, divergence aloft, or from storm-produced outflows at the surface.

40|$|Fluidized bed dryers are {{utilised}} {{in almost}} every <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>drying</b> applications and therefore improved control strategies are always of great interest. The nonlinear character of the process, exhibited in the mathematical model and the open loop analysis, implies that a fuzzy logic controller is appropriate because, in contrast with conventional control schemes, fuzzy control inherently compensates for process nonlinearities and exhibits more robust behaviour. In this study, a fuzzy logic controller is proposed; its design {{is based on a}} heuristic approach and its performance is compared against a conventional PI controller for a variety of responses. It is shown that the fuzzy controller exhibits a remarkable dynamic behaviour, equivalent if not better than the PI controller, {{for a wide range of}} disturbances. In addition, the proposed fuzzy controller seems to be less sensitive to the nonlinearities of the process, achieves energy savings and enables MIMO control...|$|E
40|$|Fluidized bed and rotary dryers are two popular {{types of}} dryers {{utilized}} {{in almost every}} <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>drying.</b> In this study, both dryers are analysed regarding their design and operational performance, {{so that they could}} be compared in a straightforward way. The mathematical models describing the convective drying process were evaluated for both types of dryers. Design procedures aiming at the determination of optimum sizing and operational characteristics for each type involved were carried out by appropriately optimizing the total annual cost of each structure for a given production capacity. Both dryer types were compared explicitely by evaluating optimum configurations {{for a wide range of}} production capacity values. Once the dryer sizing parameters are defined, its operational performance can be evaluated by comparing the optimum operational cost versus production capacity for predefined optimum designed structures. Rotary dryers turn out to be rather expensive compared to fluidized bed dryers, regarding design. On operational grounds, however, it is the other way around, due to the understandably favored heat transfer achieved in rotary dryers. Characteristic examples covering a wide range of materials - from food products to inorganic minerals - are included in order to demonstrate the performance of each process as well as the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|E
