5|$|<b>Altimeter</b> <b>setting</b> is a {{term and}} {{quantity}} used in aviation. The regional or local air pressure at mean sea level is called the <b>altimeter</b> <b>setting,</b> and the pressure which will calibrate the altimeter to show the height above ground at a given QNH airfield.|$|E
25|$|The <b>altimeter</b> <b>setting</b> in aviation, is an {{atmospheric}} pressure adjustment.|$|E
25|$|None of the {{evidence}} established {{the cause of the}} collision. However, in the opinion of the court of inquiry the cause would probably be found in one of the factors mentioned. It also noted that although the air traffic system was satisfactory, not all of the procedures involved appeared to have been equally promulgated. It therefore came with a series of recommendations. Broadcast of the regional QFF should be done on time and as a priority. All clearances into a control zone should include the regional QFF and any local reading should not be given. <b>Altimeter</b> <b>setting</b> messages should be sent on their own and not included in other messages to avoid confusion. Air traffic procedures should be uniformly applicable to all users. Air traffic officers should be examined periodically. Ensure that there is no possibility of controllers confusing future regional QFF with the current QFF. RAF crews should be given more information on procedures in the Metropolitan Control Zone.|$|E
5000|$|Pilots can {{estimate}} height {{above sea}} level with an <b>altimeter</b> <b>set</b> to a defined barometric pressure. Generally, the pressure used to <b>set</b> the <b>altimeter</b> is the barometric pressure that would exist at MSL in the region being flown over. This pressure {{is referred to as}} either QNH or [...] "altimeter" [...] and is transmitted to the pilot by radio from air traffic control (ATC) or an automatic terminal information service (ATIS). Since the terrain elevation is also referenced to MSL, the pilot can estimate height above ground by subtracting the terrain altitude from the altimeter reading. Aviation charts are divided into boxes and the maximum terrain altitude from MSL in each box is clearly indicated. Once above the transition altitude, the <b>altimeter</b> is <b>set</b> to the international standard atmosphere (ISA) pressure at MSL which is 1013.25 hPa or 29.92 inHg.|$|R
50|$|The {{transition}} altitude (TA) is the altitude {{above sea level}} at which aircraft change {{from the use of}} local barometer derived altitudes to the use of flight levels. When operating at or below the TA, aircraft <b>altimeters</b> are usually <b>set</b> to show the altitude above sea level. Above the TA, the aircraft <b>altimeter</b> pressure <b>setting</b> is normally adjusted to the standard pressure setting of 1013.25 hectopascals (millibars) or 29.92 inches of mercury and aircraft altitude will be expressed as a flight level.|$|R
25|$|The {{court found}} no {{evidence}} of error by the Swedish crew, although it noted that the erroneous QFF may have caused the altimeter to be wrong by one millibar. Although there was evidence of a failure to adhere to proper radio communications procedure, it probably was not a factor in the accident. The report stated there was {{reason to believe that the}} York's <b>altimeters</b> were <b>set</b> a lot higher than the Regional QFF. This may have been caused by using the wrong QFF sent earlier by the controller or that the <b>altimeters</b> were still <b>set</b> to the standard mean sea level barometric pressure.|$|R

40|$|This article reviews several {{recently}} developed Lagrangian tools and shows how their com- bined use succeeds in obtaining {{a detailed description}} of purely advective transport events in general aperiodic flows. In particular, because of the climate impact of ocean transport processes, we illustrate a 2 D application on <b>altimeter</b> data <b>sets</b> over the area of the Kuroshio Current, although the proposed techniques are general and applicable to arbitrary time depen- dent aperiodic flows. The first challenge for describing transport in aperiodical time dependent flows is obtaining a representation of the phase portrait where the most relevant dynamical features may be identified. This representation is accomplished by using global Lagrangian descriptors that when applied for instance to the <b>altimeter</b> data <b>sets</b> retrieve over the ocean surface a phase portrait where the geometry of interconnected dynamical systems is visible. The phase portrait picture is essential because it evinces which transport routes are acting on the whole flow. Once these routes are roughly recognised it is possible to complete a detailed description by the direct computation of the finite time stable and unstable manifolds of special hyperbolic trajectories that act as organising centres of the flow...|$|R
