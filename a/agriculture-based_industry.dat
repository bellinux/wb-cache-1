In the first part it is defined the set of sectors that belong to the Brazilian Agribusiness and in the second one the Agribusiness GDP is measured for 1995. The Agribusiness was decomposed into 2 complexes: a) Vegetal Products; and b) Animal Products. In terms of shares in the Brazilian GDP one has that in 1995 the Agribusiness answered for around 29 % of the Brazilian GDP, while the shares of Vegetal Products and Animal Products were of 20. 5 % and 8. 5 %, respectively. The contribution of each complex for the GDP of the Agribusiness was also estimated, giving a share of 71. 35 % for the Vegetal Products complex and of 28. 65 % for the Animal Products complex. The shares of the <b>agriculture-based</b> <b>industries</b> in the Agribusiness GDP were also estimated. We should stress that the results were obtained through the development of new techniques that on one hand are consistent with the methodology used by IBGE to estimate the Brazilian National Accounts, and on the other hand this new methodology solves the problem of double counting found in early estimates of the Brazilian Agribusiness GDP. As such, the results in this paper should present a better picture of what is really the Brazilian Agribusiness. ...|$|R
40|$|High {{economic}} growth is the target of economic development in each area. Economic development should be prioritized in sectors {{that can be a}} major driver of the economy so that the economy can grow faster. Economic growth {{can be seen from the}} aggregate demand side, namely consumption, investment, government spending, exports and imports, and the aggregate supply side namely labor growth, capital growth and the growth of TFP (Total Factor Productivity). This study uses South Kalimantan’s Input-Output Tables of 2000, 2005 and 2010. The results showed that although the structure of the value-added of the mining sector remains the main economic pillar, but this sector has low linkages with other sectors. The prime mover and driving {{economic growth}} sector are manufacturing sector i. e chemical industry, food, beverages and tobacco industry, rubber and plastics industry, paper, printing and publishing industry and industry of metal, machinery, transport equipment and other manufacturing industries. Based Multiplier Product Matrix, manufacturing industry suggest a leading role in the economy so that it can be said that the province of South Kalimantan are heading toward a change in the economic structure. Decomposition of sources of growth based on the Chenery’s model (1960) showed that the main source of economic growth in South Kalimantan is exports by 67 percent in the period 2000 - 2005 and 73. 72 percent in the period 2005 - 2010, especially the export of coal. Decomposition of productivity growth made by Namura and Kuroda’s model (2004) and suggests that TFP growth and capital have a strong linear relationship and significant Output growth, while labor productivity have no significant correlation with Output growth.

40|$|Since 2011, Myanmar has {{progressively}} liberalized {{its international}} trade and investment policies, resulting in both opportunities and challenges. The rising inequality between urban and non-urban areas, and within urban areas, has become {{a growing concern for}} policy makers, in addition to the existing and pervasive poverty issue. This research considers whether the support of a more skilled premium in labour supply, through investment in the human capital policy, can significantly improvement current developmental constraints. The research also investigates what policies Myanmar must integrate alongside its trade and investment liberalization policies to ensure inclusive growth. To highlight the concerns of this research, the concept of Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) and the ORANI_G single country model are applied to test a sample of 57 sectors, under 15 different industries, by using the GEMPack software. The results obtained are justified and presented under four classifications of urban and non-urban industries, and confirm that by integrating Fritzen’s proposed “egalitarian, high-quality educational systems” into Myanmar’s current situation, new employment opportunities would increase by 684. 75 %: 465. 67 % from urban industries and 219. 08 % from non-urban industries. Household purchasing power would also grow noticeably: by 149. 93 % in urban households, 61. 78 % in rural households, 13. 01 % in regional households and 28. 24 % in households from supporting families. The overall capacity of Myanmar’s labour force and a household’s purchasing power would be better, and the income inequality gap within urban and non-urban could be reduced to some extent. However, urban and non-urban income inequality gap could still be existed, over a period of 2 years. This study finds that, in an economy driven by human capital, Myanmar’s five service sectors, four primary production sectors, 16 value-added sectors (made up of 6 labour-intensive sectors and 10 capital-intensive sectors) could increase production capacity and establish stronger market competitiveness. Competitive output prices would establish market competition, both in domestic and export markets, and thus, the current account deficit problem would also be eased. This finding highlights the viability of shifting Myanmar’s economic structure from <b>agriculture-based</b> <b>industries</b> and primary-product industries to knowledge- and skill-based industries and capital-based industries. Policy improvement brings about an increase in employment opportunities by 74. 69 % from urban industries and by 25. 31 % from non-urban industries. If Myanmar policy-makers could intervene with other policies that control rising land and capital prices, as well as with financial and monetary policies that control the inflation rate, an additional five urban sectors and two regional industries could grow in the short-term with a 99. 66 % increase in employment: 72. 69 % from urban industries and 26. 97 % from non-urban industries. Overall, if Myanmar policy-makers implement education alongside trade and investment liberalization policy and financial and monetary policy, labour-intensive production industries and primary-production industries will improve, as well as the skilled and capital-intensive industries. Such economic growth could equal East Asia’s rate of development...|$|R

40|$|Agriculture {{must meet}} the {{challenge}} of feeding increasing populations but it cannot also be expected to provide employment and income to more and more people. Indeed, if farming practices are to become more productive, the introduction of better tools, animal draft and tractor power and chemical weed and pest control may well result in lower labour requirements on farms. Historically, industrialization has absorbed labour surplus to agriculture. However, industrialization is not necessarily synonymous with large, urban-barged factories and chemical plants; in the past most countries first developed industries based on processing primary products and on providing services to these industries and to agriculture. There is considerable potential for ACP countries to develop <b>agriculture-based</b> <b>industries.</b> Some countries already have large grain milling complexes, and processing plants for palm oil and rubber production. Most are situated in large towns and even ports because they process either imported products (grain) or products for export (oil and rubber). The potential is still there though for more small and medium-scale industries in the rural areas for processing grains and tubers, extracting vegetable oils and preserving fish, fruit and other perishable crops. Also, many by-products could be re-processed for sale. These industries would add value to products, provide work and increase income to the rural population. In West Africa there is opportunity for developing appropriate processing of cassava so that a traditional food can be made more readily available to urban dwellers. In addition, flour, par-boiled rice, palm oil and dried and smoked fish are important items of local trade. Improvements in small-scale grain-mills, cassava-graters, palm kernel-crushers, solar driers and smoking ovens could improve output and productivity, reduce wastage and increase income. Vegetables and spices that are sun dried can be processed more quickly and with less waste using simple solar driers. Some countries in the Caribbean are investigating the market for dried peppers among the growing Hispanic population in Florida; others have recognized the potential for using blemished vegetables and fruit that cannot be exported for processing into chutneys, pickles and preserves. There is also the possibility of using waste bananas to make vinegar, an essential ingredient of the pickling. Where appropriate, dairying can provide opportunity for small-scale production of butter, cheese and yoghurt, and both apiculture and sericulture may be additional options. Traditional rural crafts including blacksmithing, ropemaking, pottery, leatherwork, spinning, weaving and dyeing all complement agriculture. Simple tools and implements can be made locally rather than imported, and a new generation trained as engineers must be available if motorization of agriculture is to succeed. (See Spore 27 'Mechanization a must for Africa'). Blacksmiths can also help improve the storage of crops by fabricating metal silos, while potters provide smaller containers for liquids and basket-weavers for grains, fruit and fish. If the rural economy is to nourish it must be broad-based and the activities and skills inter-dependent. Where traditional farming, fishing, processing and trading systems have been replaced by mono-crop production and centralized processing and marketing, there may be opportunity and benefit to return to a more diverse economy. An economy which offers more employment and income in the rural areas provides younger people especially with an alternative to joining the urban drift. Successful agro-industries and trade in products ranging from fresh crop to semi- and fully processed, will also provide a firm foundation of experience on which to develop further industrialization and trade. However, to succeed, government action is often necessary to prevent cut-price competition from imports and to provide training and credit for local entrepreneurs wishing to set up in the agro-industry business.
