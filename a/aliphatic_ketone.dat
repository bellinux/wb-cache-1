The strong C–O absorption near 1217  cm− 1 is more likely that of aromatic ethers, because there is a concomitant increase in absorption in the 1050 – 1010  cm− 1 region (Silverstein 2005), which is particularly apparent as the broad band in the spectra of the oxidized maltenes fraction (Fig.  3).

For bacteria a subterminal degradation of alkanes to ketones and their further metabolization has been described which always involved Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenases (BVMOs). In addition, the question has to be clarified whether alkenes are converted to ketones, in particular for the oil degrading yeast Candida maltosa little is known. In this study we show {{the degradation of}} the <b>aliphatic</b> <b>ketone</b> dodecane- 2 -one by Candida maltosa and the related yeasts Candida tropicalis, Candida catenulata and Candida albicans as well as Trichosporon asahii and Yarrowia lipolytica. One pathway is initiated by the formation of decyl acetate, resulting from a Baeyer-Villiger-oxidation of this ketone. Beyond this, an initial reduction to dodecane- 2 -ol by a keto reductase was clearly shown. In addition, two different ways to metabolize dodec- 1 -ene were proposed. One involved the formation of dodecane- 2 -one {{and the other one}} a conversion leading to carboxylic and dicarboxylic acids. Furthermore the induction of ketone degrading enzymes by dodecane- 2 -one and dodec- 1 -ene was shown.

In this paper, we review the novel single vapor phase adsorption of homologous <b>aliphatic</b> <b>ketone</b> series from propanone to hexanone onto ASC. The breakthrough time of propanone was fastest among all vapors ; this behavior is attributed to its physicochemical properties.

40|$|The photografting of {{methacrylic acid}} (MAA) onto {{high-density}} polyethylene (HDPE) initiated by aliphatic ketones, butanone, pentanone, heptanone, etc. has been reported. When these ketones were used alone or just with ethanol, grafting did not occur. However, grafting took place when a proper butanone/water/ethanol mixed solvent was used. When the volume ratio of butanone was fixed, the grafting of MAA onto HDPE became easier {{with an increase}} in the volume ratio of water. The grafting of MAA onto HDPE became easier and faster with a decrease in the volume ratio of butanone. The grafting rate increased with the increase of monomer concentration. The nature of the alcohol also affected the self-initiation by aliphatic ketone; ethanol was found to be better than methanol. Possibly, hydrogen bond formed between <b>aliphatic</b> <b>ketone</b> and water increases the energy and lifetime of the excited state of the ketone, permitting it to act as a grafting and polymerisation initiator. FTIR characterization of the grafted samples proves the successful grafting of MAA onto HDPE.

Aliphatic ketones, except for benzylacetone, had molar ab-sorptivities similar to that of creatinine, but all of these compounds had equilibrium constants approximately a tenth or less that of creatinine. The common structure for all of the compounds reacting with picrate is the carbonyl group. The variable magnitude of interference for aliphatic and cyclic ketones is ascribable to the different rate constants, molar absorptivities, and equilibrium constants as compared with creatinine. Structuresadjacento the carbonyl group signifi-cantly affect the absorptivity and equilibrium constant, but steric hindrance is the major factor affecting the rate of reaction. We postulate that the carbonyl group is required for the Jaff#{ 233 }reaction, and we suggest a mechanism for the reaction. The requisite structure for interference with the Jaif#{ 233 } method for creatinine has not been determined.

40|$|Glucocorticosteroids, natural hormones {{derived from}} -pregnane, are potent {{therapeutic}} agents {{for the treatment}} of a broad range of inflammatory diseases. Semisynthetic derivatives are widely used systemically mainly {{for the treatment of}} rheumatoid diseases and allergic manifestations, {{and many of them are}} effective by topical use in dermatoses and other skin diseases. This class of drugs is sensitive to UV radiation. They are a typical example of bichromophoric moiety: all possess an <b>aliphatic</b> <b>ketone</b> in the side chain linked to position 17 of the D ring, which absorbs UVB light. Ring A bears a keto group that is conjugated with either one or two double bonds, depending on the specific drug. In the former case (i. e., hydrocortisone) the chromophore is mainly sensitive to UVB. In the latter (i. e., betamethasone, fluocinolone, triamcinolone, flumethasone) both UVA and UVB effectively induce photolysis. The photodegradation of these drugs was studied in vitro (in the solid state, in organic and aqueous solutions, in commercial formulations) and ex vivo (in the pig skin). Both primary photoprocesses, cyclohexadienone ‘lumi’ rearrangement (under UV-A) and C- 20 ketone homolysis (under UV-B) occur and the main photoproducts formed have been isolated and characterized. Any modification of the structure of corticosteroids, in particular the loss of the side-chain, has profound effect on their anti-inflammatory activity. The drugs are also able to photoreact with biological substrates mainly through radical intermediates and one of them (betamethasone) shows phototoxic effects both ex vivo and in vivo (mice) too. All these results suggest to protect these drugs from light not only during storage but also after in vivo administration to avoid loss of therapeutic activity and potential phototoxic reactions...|$|E
