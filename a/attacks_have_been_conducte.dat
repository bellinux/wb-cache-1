40|$|A novel {{synthesis}} of the 2 -deoxy- 2, 2 -difluorocytidine nucleoside analogue gemcitabine <b>has</b> <b>been</b> achieved. Starting from the known 3, 5 -O-dibenzoyl- 2 - deoxy- 2, 2 -difluororibose, the nucleobase moiety is constructed in a linear fashion, using amino- or urea glycosylation methodology. This methodology <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> employed to synthesise nucleosides containing a tetrafluorinated ribose sugar and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> compared to conventional convergent nucleobase introduction methods. In this respect, a high-yielding Mitsunobu-based protocol <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> developed. Both purine and pyrimidine analogues <b>have</b> <b>been</b> synthesised. The aminoglycosylation methodology <b>has</b> <b>been</b> investigated {{with a range of}} amines. The methodology proves high-yielding for primary amines and lesshindered secondary amines. In contrast to expectations, their stability in acidic media was not very high. Anomerisation and ring isomerisation studies <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>conducte...</b>|$|R

Experimental performance of SRP strengthened members <b>have</b> <b>been</b> compared to those of beams ex- ternally bonded with comparable amounts of Carbon Fi ber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP). A summary of labo- ratory outcomes is herein offered focusing on the ultimat e behavior. Experimental re sults are used {{to assess the}} possibility of extending ACI 440. 2 R - 02 recommendations to the case of SRP.

40|$|K. CHAWLA, J. F. REECE REPRODUCTIVE {{behaviour}} in {{the domestic}} dog (Canisfamil-iaris) is normally believed to be non-seasonal (Reece 1991) with the bitch experiencing oestrus every seven months on average (Concannon 1991, Feldman and Nelson 1996). The interval between oestrus varies considerably between individuals and also between breeds (Bouchard and others 1991). With {{the exception of the}} basenji which has only one oestrous cycle per year (Feldman and Nelson 1996), this pattern is shown by all breeds of dog, including mongels, regardless of management or housing practices (Concannon 1991). In contrast, other members of the genus Canis are seasonal breeders usually hav-ing one period of breeding activity in the early months of the year, the northern hemisphere spring (Sheldon 1992).

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} query rewriting using views in a hybrid language allowing nominals (i. e., individual names) to occur in intentional descriptions. Of particular interest, restricted form of nominals where individual names refer to simple values enable the specification of value constraints, i. e, sets of allowed values for attributes. Such constraints are very useful in practice enabling, for example, fine-grained descriptionof queries and views in integration systems and thus can be exploited to reduce the query processing cost. We use description logics to formalize the problem of query rewriting using views in presence of value constraints and show that the technique of query rewriting {{can be used to}} process queries under the certain answer semantics. We propose a sound and complete query rewriting Bucket-like algorithm. Data mining techniques <b>have</b> <b>been</b> used to favor scalability w. r. t. the number of views.

40|$|Abstract- Maize or Corn (Zea mays L.) is {{the most}} {{important}} cereal in the world after wheat and rice. It possesses high nutritive value and is important as a coarse grain. In Sri Lanka, this crop has cultivated, around 30, 000 ha and local consumption is around 200, 000 mt annually. Further, Maize is an easily grown crop and the cultivation <b>has</b> <b>been</b> popular among farmers as a cost effective crop with limited fertilizers. This Crop earns a reasonable foreign exchange as it is used as infant foods. Maize has a higher leafy mass and higher vegetative growth within shorter period of time than the other monoculture crops. Therefore, like for many other cereal crops, it is worthwhile in studying the environmental impacts due to this plant. Many researchers have shown that soil {{is the most}} affected environment due to monoculture plants. But no proper studies on soil quality changes due to this maize crop <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>conducte...</b>|$|R
40|$|The species {{composition}} and population dynamics of mosquito adults trapped at 76 sites in southern Israel are described. Almost 200 000 specimens representing 23 species were collected. Five species, Aedes detritus (Haliday), Culiseta subochrea (Edwards), Culex antennatus (Becker), Cx. rnartinii Medschid and Cx. poicilipes (Theobald), are new records for this area, with Cx. poicilipes being recorded {{for the first}} time outside Africa. Six types of distribution patterns were discerned. The most abundant species was Cx. pipiens L. (79 - 7 % of the total catch) followed by Ae. caspius (Pallas) (10 %), Anopheles sergentii (Theobald) (2 - 1 %), An. tenebrosus D 6 nitz (1. 8 %) and Cx. perexiguus Theobald (1 - 3 %). All other species found each made up less than 1 %. The spatial and temporal patterns of mosquito species in southern Israel are discussed. A comprehensive project on arboviral vectors in southern Israel was initiated in December 1981. Previously, most studies on adult mosquitoes in Israel <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>conducte...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audiencehe aim of {{this work}} is to study the {{formation}} of macrocracks orthogonal to the substrate in yttria-stabilised zirconia coatings, deposited {{in one or two}} thick passes (more than a hundred urn each), by a direct current (DC) plasma torch. Zirconia was air plasma sprayed on Hastelloy X substrates, with a NiCrAlY bond coat. The different parameters, which control this phenomenon, are considered through a statistical approach. A special attention is devoted to the quenching stress during deposition. A particular resulting microstructure with columnar zirconia grains is presented.

40|$|Written texts {{produced}} by 10 Italian deaf native signers in four different writing tasks were analyzed. Data analysis fo-cused on linguistic and orthographic nonstandard forms. The written production of deaf subjects with deaf parents (DD) {{was compared to}} the written production in two control groups: a group of 10 hearing subjects with deaf parents (HD) {{and a group of}} 10 subjects who have had no contact with deaf people or sign language (HH). The results dupli-cate findings from previous studies. Deaf subjects display a pattern of selective difficulty with Italian grammatical mor-phology, especially with free-standing function words. The four different writing tasks {{used in the present study}} yield results indicating that text type does influence our assess-ment of deaf writing abilities. A comparison of the texts writ-ten by deaf native signers with those of two hearing groups confirms the view that difficulties in the acquisition of writ-ten Italian are best explained by deafness itself, not by the influence of a previously acquired Sign Language, and that the specific difficulties with grammatical morphology dis-played by our deaf subjects cannot be attributed solely to their limited experience with written Italian. A brief review of the literature reveals that writing abil-ities in the deaf is a neglected research topic. Further-more, most of the existing research <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>conducte...</b>|$|R

40|$|Fatigue is {{commonly}} {{reported in a}} variety of illnesses, and it has major impact on quality of life. Previously, it was thought that fatigue originates in the skeletal muscles, leading to cessation of activity. However, more recently, it has become clear that the brain is the central regulator of fatigue perception. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> suggested that proinflammatory cytokines, especially interleukin- 1 alpha (IL- 1 alpha) and interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta), play a prominent {{role in the development of}} central fatigue, and several studies <b>have</b> <b>been</b> performed to elucidate the connection between inflammation and these central processes. In this narrative review, mechanisms of action of IL- 1 are described, with special attention to its effect on the central nervous system. In addition, we present a summary of studies that (i) investigated the relationship between circulating IL- 1 alpha and IL- 1 beta and fatigue severity and/or (ii) evaluated the effect of inhibiting IL- 1 on fatigue. We aim to improve the understanding of fatigue in both inflammatory and non-inflammatory illnesses, which could help develop strategies to treat fatigue more effectively. Reviewing the studies that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> performed, it appears that there is a limited value of measuring circulating IL- 1. However, inhibiting IL- 1 has a positive effect on severe fatigue in most studies that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>conducte...</b>|$|R
