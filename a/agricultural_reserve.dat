50|$|The Swan Creek district, {{situated}} about 11 kilometres from Warwick, {{was known}} as the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Reserve</b> and comprised a tract of fertile country wedged between extensive pastoral holdings. Early settlers arriving in Swan Creek during the 1860s were successful in having the district surveyed and offered for sale in agricultural farm areas. 18 acres of the Warwick <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Reserve,</b> being portion 284, was granted to Joseph Thomas Wilson in May 1868 and it is on this land that the White Swan Inn was later built.|$|E
50|$|Burndale is {{important}} in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history, in particular the settlement of <b>agricultural</b> <b>reserves</b> in the Darling Downs area.|$|R
50|$|By 1864 Petrie had {{constructed}} a more substantial timber homestead {{at the top}} of the broad hill above his original slab hut - likely reflecting his recently acquired security of tenure. An 1863 report on <b>agricultural</b> <b>reserves</b> noted that portion 23 contained a house and was cultivated and fenced.|$|R
50|$|In particular, {{the place}} is {{significant}} for its association with the agricultural settlement of the Logan River district. It was the first national school established on the Logan Reserve (one of the earliest and most extensive <b>agricultural</b> <b>reserves</b> in Queensland), and remains in situ and in use {{as part of the}} present-day Waterford State School.|$|R
50|$|The cottage survives {{as one of}} the {{earliest}} dwellings in Toowoomba, and is important in demonstrating the evolution of Toowoomba from an <b>agricultural</b> <b>reserve</b> to an important municipal centre, from the 1850s.|$|E
50|$|Hughesville {{was arguably}} the finest {{house in the}} district, a farming {{community}} approximately eight {{miles south of the}} One-mile Swamp (Woolloongabba). The Eight Mile Plains had been combed by timbergetters prior to its opening as an <b>agricultural</b> <b>reserve</b> in the early 1860s. Over 7,800 acres in the nearby Coopers Plains area had been proclaimed the Brisbane <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Reserve</b> in June 1861. In October 1864, this was extended by a further 5,500 acres, and the whole - encompassing what are now the suburbs of Sunnybank, Sunnybank Hills, Runcorn, Kuraby, Eight Mile Plains, and parts of Coopers Plains, Algester and Stretton - were proclaimed the Eight Mile Plains <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Reserve.</b> Fruit and some vegetable growing were the principal activities. By 1869, the area was sufficiently populated to necessitate the opening of a school at Eight Mile Plains, but the real impetus for the expansion of small farming in the district came {{with the opening of the}} extension railway from Yeerongpilly to Loganlea, in April 1885. By the time Hughesville was erected in the 1890s, Eight Mile Plains had emerged as a solid farming community.|$|E
50|$|The first {{schools in}} the Upper Logan and Albert rivers {{district}} {{were associated with the}} opening of the Logan <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Reserve</b> in the 1860s. A few private schools appeared briefly, but were soon absorbed into the public education system.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to these areas, over [...] of arable land are protected by the <b>Agricultural</b> Land <b>Reserve.</b>|$|R
25|$|Protecting <b>agricultural</b> land <b>reserves</b> {{also play}} an {{important}} part in the charter of sustainability. The idea behind the <b>agricultural</b> land <b>reserves</b> is to encourage and increase the role of urban agriculture thus reducing the reliance of food transport and increasing the quality and availability of food to local people. The Charter takes the idea one step further by bringing in value adding food processing agribusiness to complete the supply chain circle.|$|R

50|$|The name of Eight Mile Plains {{is linked}} to the early days of settlement. It refers to the area's {{topography}} as well as the distance (eight miles) by bush track to One Mile (1.6 km) Swamp (now Woolloongabba). In 1861, over 7800 acre in the nearby Coopers Plains area had been proclaimed the Brisbane <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Reserve.</b> In 1864 this was extended by a further 5500 acre and the Eight Mile Plains <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Reserve</b> was formed. It comprised the current suburbs of Sunnybank, Sunnybank Hills, Runcorn, Kuraby, Eight Mile Plains and parts of Coopers Plains, Algester and Stretton. Electricity was extended to the district in 1936 and in 1958 a new school was constructed to service the area.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{challenges}} to maintaining {{the character of}} the <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Reserve,</b> are several listed by a local advocacy group: The high costs of operating a farm in Montgomery County; increased development of private facilities (e.g. private schools); and development of new highways.|$|E
50|$|Poolesville lies off Montgomery County's main axis of {{suburban}} development along the Interstate 270 and Maryland State Route 355 corridor, {{separated from the}} contiguous Maryland suburbs of Washington by the rural lands of the county <b>agricultural</b> <b>reserve,</b> where new housing and commercial starts are restricted.|$|E

40|$|Food Security and Food Sovereignty {{are two of}} {{the most}} {{important}} issues facing Food Policy. Maintaining productive farmland and sustainable farms as well as providing adequate volumes of foodstuffs have led to measures to protect farmland and farm activities in many countries. These include land use planning with agricultural zones and in some jurisdictions legislation to ‘protect’ agriculture in <b>agricultural</b> <b>reserves.</b> Are these tools adequate to maintain sustainable agricultures particularly around major urban and metropolitan centers. Agricultural zones and <b>agricultural</b> <b>reserves</b> in many jurisdictions have continued to experience removal of farmland in order to permit different types of urban development (e. g. residential development and industrial parks). An emerging response to this has been the integration of strategic development planning for agriculture in certain jurisdictions (e. g. the province of Quebec (Canada)), because this approach can integrate the necessary parameters to enable the development of sustainable agricultures, including how to respond to opportunities as well as adapting to emerging stressors. This approach also ideally requires the integration of farmers and their families as actors and participants in the strategic development planning process. Peer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|The farm {{is located}} on the former Logan River <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Reserve.</b> The {{creation}} of agricultural reserves was one of the Queensland Government's earliest initiatives following separation from New South Wales in December 1859. Expanding agricultural production within Queensland's pastoral-based economy was necessary to reduce the colony's dependence on imported foodstuffs, and to encourage cash cropping of export commodities such as cotton and sugar. The Alienation of Crown Lands Act of 1860 incorporated provision for the government to create agricultural reserves on which good arable land was to be sold cheaply at the fixed price of £1 per acre. In the same year, an area of approximately 20,000 acres along the lower reaches of the Logan River 17 miles (30 kilometres) southeast of Brisbane was surveyed into farm portions. On 2 January 1861 this area was proclaimed the Logan River <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Reserve,</b> with the first sale of land on the reserve held in Brisbane on 2 April 1862. Extensions to the reserve totalling 33,000 acres were proclaimed in 1863 and 1864. The land that Christian Kruger later acquired was part of the second extension to the Logan River <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Reserve.</b> It was surveyed in 1865 and first offered for sale on 19 April 1866, but was not alienated at the time.|$|E
50|$|Since 1999, Law #275 {{declared}} the Central Coloso industrial complex as a historic monument.

50|$|Poolesville {{is a town}} in {{the western}} portion of Montgomery County, Maryland. The {{population}} was 4,883 at the 2010 United States Census. It is surrounded by (but is technically not part of) the Montgomery County <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Reserve,</b> and is considered a distant bedroom community for commuters to Washington, D.C.|$|E
50|$|The Anthony J. Catanese Center for Urban and Environmental Solutions at Florida Atlantic University {{notes the}} unusual growth pattern of South Florida. Unlike many areas with {{centralized}} cities surrounded by development, most of South Florida is preserved natural area and designated <b>agricultural</b> <b>reserves,</b> with development restricted to a dense, narrow strip along the coast. The developed area is highly urbanized and increasingly continuous and decentralized, with no particular dominant core cities. The center projects this pattern {{to continue in}} the future.|$|R

50|$|The penal {{settlement}} {{based in}} Brisbane was closed in 1841 {{and the land}} was quickly taken up by squatters. The first leases {{of land in the}} Logan area were issued from 1849 and immigration was encouraged following the separation from NSW in 1859. The declaration of the Logan and Eight Mile Plains <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Reserves</b> in 1862 led to extensive settlement of the area. German immigrants arrived in batches from the 1864 onwards. Generous land orders for immigrants in Queensland created a drawcard in the possibility of owning their own farm.|$|R
5000|$|... Purchased a 62-acre parcel (last large subdividable parcel, 1,350 ft oceanfront) parcel in Sagaponack, NY for development. This parcel was {{subdivided}} into four estate lots, while creating 40 acres of <b>agricultural</b> <b>reserve.</b> This {{was one of}} the largest oceanfront real estate developments {{in the history of the}} Hamptons.|$|E
50|$|The Waterford {{district}} was opened to closer settlement {{from the early}} 1860s, following proclamation on 2 January 1861 of the Logan <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Reserve</b> - 20,000 acres {{to the north and}} west of the Logan River, about 17 miles south of Brisbane. The first allotments were offered for selection in April 1862. The reserve was more than doubled in 1863, with an extension of 25,000 acres south and east of the river proclaimed on 7 August 1863. The Reserve then encompassed the districts of Loganlea, Waterford, Logan Reserve, Logan Village, Buccan, Chambers Flat, Stockleigh and parts of Maclean (now North Maclean and South Maclean) and Park Ridge. On 18 October 1864, a further 8,000 acres extension to the Logan <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Reserve</b> was proclaimed - north of the Logan River, around Loganholme.|$|E
50|$|European {{settlement}} at Logan Village itself {{originated in}} its location {{as the head}} of navigation on the Logan River, and with the Logan <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Reserve</b> being proclaimed in 1862 for freehold selection. The first constructions were a wharf and store for the cotton plantation at ‘Townsvale’ (Veresdale) owned by Robert Towns.|$|E
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of the land in the valley bottom surrounding the town is protected by the <b>Agricultural</b> Land <b>Reserve</b> which prevents valuable agricultural lands from being converted into other uses.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, a {{group of}} landowners applied to the provincial Agricultural Land Commission to have {{approximately}} 85% of the land outside the Indian reserve removed from the <b>Agricultural</b> Land <b>Reserve.</b> On July 19, 2006 the Commission rejected the application.|$|R
2500|$|Agricultural land in {{the valley}} [...] much of it {{protected}} by the <b>Agricultural</b> Land <b>Reserve</b> [...] is intensively farmed: the Fraser Valley brings in over half of British Columbia's annual agricultural revenue, although it makes up {{a small percentage of}} the province's total land area.|$|R
50|$|Broad Run is a {{tributary}} stream of the Potomac River in Montgomery County, Maryland. The {{headwaters of the}} stream originates west {{of the town of}} Poolesville, and the creek flows southward for 8.9 mi to the Potomac River.

50|$|The former White Swan Inn is {{important}} in demonstrating the development of Swan Creek which was in an area formerly set aside as an <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Reserve.</b> The former White Swan Inn demonstrates the principal characteristics of a small sandstone house in Queensland, particularly of those constructed {{in the nineteenth century}} in and around Warwick.|$|E
50|$|The Redcliffe <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Reserve</b> {{was opened}} up for {{agricultural}} selection in 1863 and Constance Spry, a local land speculator, purchased {{the site in}} December 1866 and sold the 40 acres (16.19 hectares) to William Townsend in February 1867. Ten years later Townsend subdivided the land and sub 1 of portion 32, 1 acre (0.4 hectares) was acquired by the Presbyterian Church.|$|E
