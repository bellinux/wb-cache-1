50|$|Scholars {{have argued}} that these {{official}} arrest statistics do not fully reflect actual criminal behavior as the criminal stereotype that <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> hold influences the decisions to make arrests. Specifically, because the stereotype of <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>is</b> pervasive and embedded in society, police officers unconsciously believe that <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> dangerous {{and are therefore more}} likely to arrest <b>African</b> <b>Americans.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> {{consistently}} {{arrested for}} violent crimes. In 1993, <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> accounted for 45 percent and 50 percent of crimes for murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. In general, <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> approximately six {{times more likely}} to be arrested for violent crimes than <b>are</b> whites. <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> also most overrepresented in robbery in 1993, comprising 62 percent of arrestees. <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> accounted for 52.5% of homicide offenders from 1980 to 2008, with whites 45.3% and [...] "Other" [...] 2.2%. The offending rate for blacks was almost 8 times higher than whites while blacks account for less than 15% of people living in the United States.|$|R

5|$|In Nashville, {{like most}} Southern cities, <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> {{severely}} disadvantaged under {{the system of}} Jim Crow segregation.

5|$|During these {{workshops}} it {{was decided}} that the first target for the group's actions would be downtown lunch counters. At the time, <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> allowed to shop in downtown stores but were not allowed to eat in the stores' restaurants. The group felt that the lunch counters were a good objective because they were highly visible, easily accessible, and provided a stark example of the injustices black Southerners faced every day.|$|E

5|$|A Naval Board of Inquiry was convened on July 21, 1944, to {{find out}} what had happened. The {{official}} proceeding lasted for 39 days and included interviews with witnesses who were officers, civilians and enlisted men.

Five <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> questioned, none of whom were later to refuse to load ammunition. Captain Kinne's posted division tonnage results came to light in the inquiry but Kinne stated that the competition to load the most tonnage did not make for unsafe conditions; he implied that any junior officers who said so did not know what they were talking about.|$|E
5|$|A Republican, Harrison {{was elected}} to the {{presidency}} in 1888, defeating the Democratic incumbent, Grover Cleveland. Hallmarks of Harrison's administration included unprecedented economic legislation, including the McKinley Tariff, which imposed historic protective trade rates, and the Sherman Antitrust Act. Harrison also facilitated the creation of the national forest reserves through an amendment to the Land Revision Act of 1891. During his administration six western states were admitted to the Union. In addition, Harrison substantially strengthened and modernized the U.S. Navy and conducted an active foreign policy, but his proposals to secure federal education funding as well as voting rights enforcement for <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|<b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> {{originally}} {{admitted to}} the university in the mid-1950s, but few attended until the 1970s; fraternities at this time were generally racially and religiously segregated. Although a student fraternity committee emphasized the fraternities' rejection of racial discrimination, in 1969 only 5 of 578 fraternity pledges were black. African-American fraternities and sororities soon established chapters at the university, although they presented themselves as service organizations rather than traditional social organizations. In the mid-1970s, although some black students were {{invited to join the}} heavily white fraternities, many preferred to join their own organizations. By the fall of 1973, four black fraternities and one black sorority had established chapters on grounds.|$|E

40|$|America {{is often}} {{considered}} to be a post-racial society where race is no longer a significant contributing factor to a person’s ability to lead a successful life. The 2008 election of Barack Obama has been championed as the official end of widespread racial discrimination, especially for the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> community. Since an <b>African</b> <b>American</b> has <b>been</b> able to ascend to the highest position in American society, many White Americans have erroneously assumed that the success of an individual <b>African</b> <b>American</b> <b>is</b> not hindered by race and that any variation in success between Whites and <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>is</b> due to personal factors. When analyzing the current socioeconomic, educational, and legal barriers that continue to limit the freedoms of <b>African</b> <b>Americans,</b> it becomes clear that America’s post-racial society has fallen short of its aim to rid the country of racial intolerance and privilege and has perpetuated inequality among <b>African</b> <b>Americans.</b> If <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> to achieve the freedom they were promised {{at the end of the}} Civil Rights Movement, America must discontinue its push to be a post-racial society...|$|R
40|$|<b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> {{like most}} Americans, spend a {{substantial}} amount of time and energy working. Historically, the quality of work life among <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> has <b>been</b> structured by inequality (Farley and Allen, 1987).

5|$|By 1910, {{thousands}} of <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> {{moving from the}} South to Chicago, as a major destination in the Great Migration to northern and midwestern cities, fleeing lynchings, segregation and disenfranchisement in the Deep South. The revived Ku Klux Klan committed 64 lynchings in 1918 and 83 in 1919 in southern states. With industrial jobs in the stockyards and meatpacking industry opening as European immigration was cut off by World War I, from 1916 to 1919 the African-American population in Chicago increased from 44,000 to 109,000, a 148 percent increase during the decade.|$|E
5|$|During {{the post-war}} Reconstruction era, Virginia adopted a {{constitution}} which provided for free public schools, and guaranteed political, civil, and voting rights. The populist Readjuster Party ran an inclusive coalition until the conservative white Democratic Party gained power after 1883. It passed segregationist Jim Crow laws and in 1902 rewrote the Constitution of Virginia {{to include a}} poll tax and other voter registration measures that effectively disfranchised most African Americans and many poor European Americans. Though their schools and public services were segregated and underfunded {{due to a lack}} of political representation, <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> able to unite in communities and take a greater role in Virginia society.|$|E
5|$|During {{the time}} when <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> barred from ordination, women began to receive greater {{opportunities}} for leadership. Women formed {{an important part of}} the Assemblies of God's constituency, many being Sunday School workers and evangelists, most prominent being Aimee Semple McPherson (who would later found the Foursquare Church). This made the issue of women's place in the movement important in the 1930s. It was also recognized that many congregations who could not afford male pastors relied on women preachers. Despite the fact that opposition to female pastors had been regularly affirmed since 1914, the office of pastor was opened to women in 1935.|$|E

50|$|Due {{to racial}} disparities in the U.S. prison system, <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> and Latinos <b>are</b> overrepresented in the incarcerated {{population}}. Thus, more <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> and Latinos <b>are</b> often subject to felony disenfranchisement. While <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> only 13 percent of U.S. population, {{they make up}} 38 percent of the prison population. Latinos account for about 15 percent of the U.S. population and make up 20 percent of Americans in prison.|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to Uncle Tom's Cabin, {{writers in the}} Southern United States produced {{a number of books}} to rebut Stowe's novel. This so-called Anti-Tom literature generally took a pro-slavery viewpoint, arguing that the issues of slavery as depicted in Stowe's book were overblown and incorrect. The novels in this genre tended to feature a benign white patriarchal master and a pure wife, both of whom presided over childlike slaves in a benevolent extended family style plantation. The novels either implied or directly stated that <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> a childlike people unable to live their lives without being directly overseen by white people.|$|E
5|$|Postwar {{social unrest}} was {{also related to}} the {{difficulties}} of absorbing the veterans {{from the war in}} the job market. Competition among groups for work heightened tensions. In the 1920s there was growing anti-Semitism in the United States related to economic competition and the fears of social change from decades of changed immigration, a lingering anti-German sentiment left over from World War I, and anti-black violence erupted in numerous locations as well. In this period <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> leaving the South by the tens of thousands, to escape oppressive social conditions and find work in the North and Midwestern industrial cities, in what came to be called the Great Migration.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet media {{frequently}} covered racial discrimination, financial crises, {{and unemployment}} in the United States, which were viewed as failings of the capitalist system that had been erased by communism. Lynchings of <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> seen as an embarrassing skeleton in the closet for the US, which the Soviets used {{as a form of}} rhetorical ammunition when reproached for their own economic and social failings. The phrase grew in usage in the 1960s during the Cold War. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the phrase became widespread as a reference to Russian information-warfare tactics. Its use subsequently became widespread in Russia to criticize any form of U.S. policy.|$|E

50|$|A {{stereotype}} is {{the association}} of a person or a social group with a consistent set of traits. This may include {{both positive and negative}} traits, such as <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> great at sports or <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> more violent than any other race in the United States. There are many types of stereotypes that exists: racial, cultural, gender, group (i.e. college students), all being very explicit in the lives of many people.|$|R
5|$|The United States Cabinet has had 22 African-American {{appointed}} officers. The US Census Bureau defines African Americans {{as citizens}} or {{residents of the}} United States who have origins {{in any of the}} black populations of Africa. The term is generally used for Americans with at least partial ancestry in any of the original peoples of sub-Saharan Africa. During the founding of the federal government, <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> consigned to a status of second-class citizenship or enslaved. No African American ever held a Cabinet position before the Civil Rights Movement or the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and labor unions.|$|E
5|$|In the 1880s, Tillman, {{a wealthy}} landowner, became {{dissatisfied}} with the Democratic leadership and led a movement of white farmers calling for reform. He was initially unsuccessful, though he {{was instrumental in the}} founding of Clemson University as an agricultural school. In 1890, Tillman took control of the state Democratic Party, and was elected governor. During his four years in office, 18 <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> lynched in South Carolina—the 1890s saw the most lynchings of any decade in South Carolina. Tillman tried to prevent lynchings, but spoke in support of the lynch mobs, stating his own willingness to lead one. In 1894, {{at the end of his}} second two-year term, he was elected to the U.S. Senate by vote of the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, a {{significant}} number of lynchings occurred in the Southern United States, primarily of African Americans in the states of Georgia, Mississippi, and Texas. Between 1890 and 1920, about 3,000 <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> killed by lynch mobs, usually after whites were the victims of crimes purportedly committed by blacks. Supporters of lynching justified the practice as a way to assert dominance over African Americans, to whom they attributed a criminal nature. Lynching also provided a sense of white solidarity in a culture with changing demographics and power structures. Although lynching was tolerated by much of southern society, opponents of the practice emerged, including some religious leaders and the nascent National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).|$|E
50|$|Segregated housing {{patterns}} {{also keep}} <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> far from suburbanizing jobs and associated job information networks. This mismatch between residential locations and employment reduce the employment options for middle- and lower-class <b>African</b> <b>Americans.</b> These segregated housing patterns {{are supported by}} discriminatory mortgage lending practices and overt attempts to keep suburban neighborhoods racially exclusive. Although most <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> not living below the poverty line, what is middle-class for most white <b>Americans</b> <b>is</b> vastly different to what is middle-class for most <b>African</b> <b>Americans.</b> The few black professionals in all-white neighborhoods are not representative of the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> middle class by any stretch. Rather, most <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> lower middle-class living from paycheck to paycheck, employed in such jobs as retail, and facing many problems and circumstances worse off even than poor whites. Hence, what is vastly missing from the <b>African</b> <b>American</b> community <b>is</b> a cohesive, central middle class.|$|R
