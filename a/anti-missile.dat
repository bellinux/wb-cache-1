5|$|Fragile Allegiance has {{a simplistic}} combat {{system with the}} player having no direct control over units when a fleet enters combat. Enemy asteroids can be {{attacked}} using ships, missiles and agents. During a battle, laser beams criss-cross the screen and buildings catch fire before being destroyed. Ground turrets fire back at attacking ships and <b>anti-missile</b> turrets shoot out incoming missiles.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship has}} {{self-defence}} capability and {{is equipped with}} an indigenous <b>anti-missile</b> defence chaff system. On-board systems include fully automatic engine controls, power management and battle damage control systems. According to the navy, the ship was designed to operate as a command platform. The ship is fitted with four AK-630 Close-in weapon systems, which can fire {{at a rate of}} 4,000 to 10,000 rounds a minute.|$|E
5|$|Although ship-fired {{missiles}} {{can provide}} support for shore-based units, they are susceptible to interception by <b>anti-missile</b> systems such as the Aegis Combat System and MIM-104 Patriot system developed by the United States and used by NATO nations. These systems were designed to track and destroy both artillery shells and missiles. The first widely reported instances of such systems working came in 1991 when the US Patriot and Royal Navy Sea Dart missile system successfully intercepted and destroyed Iraqi Scud and Silkworm missiles.|$|E
25|$|The Republic of China {{held their}} first {{military}} parade on 10 October 2007 for National Day celebrations since 1991. Previous parades were halted {{in an effort}} to ease the tension with the PRC. The parade was aimed at easing worries that the armed forces might be unprepared for a conflict with the PRC. The parade consisted of indigenous missiles, U.S. Patriot II and Avenger <b>anti-missiles</b> systems, U.S.-made F-16s, French-made Mirages and Taiwan-made IDF fighters.|$|R
50|$|Nixon, having campaigned {{that the}} Democrats were {{deliberately}} dragging their {{feet on the}} ABM, inherited the system with his election win. He also inherited a massive NIMBY backlash that blew up in late 1968 when the Army chose to deploy the missiles in suburban locations to allow future expansion to be easier. City-dwellers could tolerate {{the idea of an}} armed rocket attack against bombers going on over their heads. They were less comfortable with the concept of nuclear <b>anti-missiles</b> detonating against incoming missiles at low altitudes.|$|R
50|$|The Institut français d’analyse stratégique studies all the {{conflicts}} around the world. Its analyses {{focus on the}} material and spiritual motives that generate them, on the military forms that they take, in particular terrorism and guerrilla warfare, and on all the technological instruments that they use. Because of the extreme importance of this latter component, the IFAS analyzes nuclear proliferation, chemical and bio-bacteriological risks, and strategies connected to missiles and <b>anti-missiles.</b> {{as well as the}} development of military activity in space. IFAS activities comprise all the fields connected with nuclear warfare, added to which is research on {{the conflicts}} and terrorism in the Middle East.|$|R
5|$|The Visakhapatnam class (Project 15B) is a {{class of}} stealth guided missile destroyers under construction. An {{improved}} version of the Kolkata class and ordered in 2011, the first Visakhapatnam-class ship {{is expected to be}} completed in 2018. The class will have enhanced stealth characteristics and state-of-the-art weaponry and sensors, including the long-range Barak 8 surface-to-air missile. The first ship's keel was laid in October 2013. The Visakhapatnam class will be armed with a 127mm main gun and an AK-630 close-in <b>anti-missile</b> gun system.|$|E

25|$|After Mao died on September 9, 1976, his rival, Deng Xiaoping, denounced {{during the}} Cultural Revolution as reactionary and {{therefore}} forced {{to retire from}} all his offices, slowly re-emerged as China's new leader in 1978. At first, new development was slowed. Then, several key projects deemed unnecessary were simply cancelled—the Fanji ABM system, the Xianfeng <b>Anti-Missile</b> Super Gun, the ICBM Early Warning Network 7010 Tracking Radar and the land-based high-power <b>anti-missile</b> laser program. Nevertheless, some development did proceed.|$|E
5000|$|By 1 April 1946 Robert P. Patterson, the Secretary of War, {{had signed}} off on an ABM. In February 1946 the War Department's Joint Committee on New Weapons and Equipment led by General Joseph Stilwell and {{generally}} known as the Stilwell Board was formed to consider the Army's post-war development priorities. On 29 May 1946 they published their report on a [...] "Proposed National Program for Guided Missiles", noting that missiles with [...] "intercontinental ranges of over 3,000 miles and payload sufficient to carry atomic explosive are to be expected." [...] They suggested that defensive measures including <b>anti-missiles</b> should be [...] "accorded priority over all other National Defense projects" [...] and that the system be capable of supersonic speeds and 100000 yard km range.|$|R
50|$|The missile, when {{fired in}} a swarm (group of 4-8) {{has a unique}} {{guidance}} mode. One of the weapons climbs to a higher altitude and designates targets while the others attack. The missile responsible for target designation climbs in short pop-ups, {{so as to be}} harder to intercept. The missiles are linked by data connections, forming a network. If the designating missile is destroyed the next missile will rise to assume its purpose. Missiles are able to differentiate targets, detect groups and prioritize targets automatically using information gathered during flight and types of ships and battle formations pre-programmed in an onboard computer. They will attack targets in order of priority, highest to lowest: after destroying the first target, any remaining missiles will attack the next prioritized target. Such description received some doubts. The missile has a means of countering the attacking <b>anti-missiles.</b> Also, the on-board computer has data to counter an enemy's electronic warfare and tactics of evasion fired in air defense.|$|R
5000|$|Despite the {{unanimity}} of {{the vote}} {{it is worth noting}} that several Security Council members expressed reserves in their accompanying statements. Representing Pakistan, Munir Akram insisted that, “Pakistan shared the view expressed in the Council’s open debate that the Council could not legislate for the world, he said. The Council could not assume the stewardship of global non-proliferation and disarmament issues. Composed of 15 States, it was not a representative body. It could not enforce the obligations assumed by five of its members which retained nuclear weapons since they also possessed the right of veto.” He added that “Pakistan had been obliged to develop nuclear weapons and related delivery systems to maintain credible minimum deterrence against external aggression, especially once similar capabilities had been developed and demonstrated by its eastern neighbour. The nuclear non-proliferation regime needed to accommodate the reality of the existence of nuclear weapons in South Asia. Given that reality, Pakistan would not accept any demand for access, much less inspections, of its nuclear and strategic assets, materials and facilities, he said. It would not share technical, military or political information that would negatively affect its national security programmes or its national interests. Pakistan would continue to develop its nuclear, missiles and related strategic capability to maintain the minimum credible deterrence vis-à-vis its eastern neighbour, which was embarked on major programmes for nuclear weapons, missiles, <b>anti-missiles</b> and conventional arms acquisition and development.” ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1970s {{and through the}} 1980s the Soviet Union and the United States theorized, {{designed}} {{and in some cases}} tested a variety of weaponry designed for warfare in outer space. Space warfare was seen primarily as an extension of nuclear warfare, and so many theoretical systems were based around the destruction or defense of ground and sea-based missiles. Space-based missiles were not attempted due to the Outer Space Treaty, which banned the use, testing or storage of nuclear weapons outside the Earth's atmosphere. When the U.S. gained [...] "interest in utilizing space-based lasers for ballistic missile defense", two facts emerged. One being that the ballistic missiles are fragile and two, chemical lasers project missile killing energy (3,000 kilometers). This meant that lasers could be put into space to intercept a Ballistic missile. [...] Systems proposed ranged from measures as simple as ground and space-based <b>anti-missiles</b> to railguns, space based lasers, orbital mines and similar weaponry. Deployment of these systems was seriously considered in the mid-1980s under the banner of the Strategic Defense Initiative announced by Ronald Reagan in 1983, using the term [...] "evil empire" [...] to describe the Soviets (hence the popular nickname [...] "Star Wars"). If the Cold War had continued, many of these systems could potentially have seen deployment: the United States developed working railguns, and a laser that could destroy missiles at range, though the power requirements, range, and firing cycles of both were impractical. Weapons like the space-based laser was rejected, not just by the government, but by Universities, moral thinkers, and religious people because it would have increased the waging of the arms race and questioned the United States' role in the Cold War.|$|R
50|$|Rhino TRU (the SPV in Anderson's earlier series): The Rhino TRU (Tactical Response Unit) is a {{heavy-duty}} attack vehicle, with an ultra-tough full armour. The Rhino {{is capable of}} high speed {{with the help of}} twin ram air booster jets at the rear. Built with ten wheels (two front sets, three rear sets), as well as with variable ride-height suspension, it is equipped with a multi-wheel steering system. This makes this cumbersome-looking vehicle easy to manoeuvre, on any kind of normal road as well as giving it good off-road performance. The Rhino is armed to the teeth with a large arsenal; two front mounted twin cannons firing explosive tipped rounds, armour piercing missiles, harpoon guns and magnetic clamp guns. There are also extendable battering rams on the front and rear. It is also equipped with evasive action <b>anti-missiles</b> launched from the rear. The Rhino is a sealed armoured vehicle, and access to the cabin is gained from the hatches on the vehicles sides. Retractable seats face the hatch openings to receive either the driver and/or passenger, which swing into position in front of the control panel. The vehicle can be driven from either side, the steering sliding into position to whoever wishes to drive it. Other hatches are situated on top of the vehicle and underneath it. The drivers cabin has a number of control screens, which act as the drivers eyes, as there is no window. Equipped with all manner of computerised equipment needed for Spectrum work, the Rhino also comes with a security device allowing the driver to lock the vehicle by password and voice command, thus avoiding theft of the Rhino by an enemy if it should be left by itself. Whenever a Rhino is needed on a given mission, Spectrum will use the Albatross to transport the vehicle. The Albatross will land and the hatch beneath will open, a lift lowering to the ground to deposit the Rhino - with driver inside - ready to perform its mission.|$|R
25|$|In 1975, the {{missiles}} were updated, the main radar was upgraded to MR-310A and two Uspekh-U radars were added. Four AK-630 close-in weapon systems were also {{added in the}} 1980s to improve <b>anti-missile</b> defence.|$|E
25|$|In 1998 SPRN {{became part}} of the missile and space defence {{organisation}} ракетно-космической обороны (RKO) together with SKKP and the <b>anti-missile</b> troops.

25|$|It was {{initially}} armed with light and medium machine guns. In 2000, self-defence capability was added by installing new close-in weapons like anti-aircraft and <b>anti-missile</b> guns and missiles. This {{was done to}} enhance the survivability of the ship during surface warfare operations on India's western seaboard. It also has a helicopter deck.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{ironic that}} the very wall that Cal built to {{effectively}} imprison the population of Mega City One helped in the city's defence {{on a number of}} occasions, including attacks from Sabbat's zombies. However its most prominent role was when the wall's weaponry functioned as an <b>anti-missile</b> defence system against Sov-block missiles during the Apocalypse War.|$|E
25|$|Shaurya {{missiles}} {{can remain}} hidden or camouflaged in underground silos from enemy surveillance or satellites till they are {{fired from the}} special storage-cum-launch canisters. The Shaurya system will require some more tests before it becomes fully operational in two-three years. Moreover, defence scientists say the high-speed, two-stage Shaurya has high maneuverability which also makes it less vulnerable to existing <b>anti-missile</b> defence systems.|$|E
25|$|Previously, {{the federal}} {{government}} under PM Brian Mulroney decided against participation in the U.S. led <b>anti-missile</b> defense system {{which was designed to}} intercept foreign missiles armed with nuclear weapons. This program, known as the Strategic Defense Initiative, was started by President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. As part of the effort to improve cooperation with the US, Harper reopened the issue, and agreed to a free-vote on the participation of Canada.|$|E
25|$|Official {{requirements}} {{were published}} in 1945; Bell Laboratories won the Ordnance contract for a short-range line-of-sight weapon under Project Nike, while a team of players led by Boeing won the contract for a long-range design known as Ground-to-Air Pilotless Aircraft, or GAPA. GAPA moved to the US Air Force when that branch was formed in 1948. In 1946 the USAAF also started two early research projects into <b>anti-missile</b> systems in Project Thumper and Project Wizard.|$|E
25|$|The space {{surveillance}} {{network was}} part of the Soviet Air Defences, called the PVO, and was incorporated as part of the missile defence and space defence force. In 1998 SKKP became part of the missile and space defence organisation ракетно-космической обороны (RKO) together with missile warning network SPRN and the <b>anti-missile</b> forces. In 2001 these services became part of the newly founded Space Troops, and were incorporated as the 3rd Independent Missile and Space Defence Army.|$|E
25|$|This {{did not do}} much to {{stop the}} squabbling, nor did it solve the {{problems}} {{that led to the}} issues in the first place – the fight over Hercules and BOMARC and related <b>anti-missile</b> developments. Nor did it stop the fighting in the press. Army Colonel John Nickerson Jr. publicly denounced Wilson, while leaking details of their latest missile design, the Pershing missile. The resulting flap led to calls for Nickerson to be court-martialed and was compared to the Billy Mitchell court-martial in the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|Israel is {{the only}} country in the world with an {{operational}} anti-ballistic missile defense system on the national level – the Arrow system, jointly funded and produced by Israel and the United States.

Israel has also worked with the US on development of a tactical high energy laser system against medium range rockets (called Nautilus or THEL).|$|E
25|$|Sydney was {{the first}} of four frigates {{selected}} to go under the A$1 billion FFG Upgrade, with HMA Ships Darwin, Melbourne and Newcastle following. The upgrade features an 8-cell Mark 41 Vertical Launch System (VLS) for 32 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles (ESSM), upgrades to fire control and air warning radars, and replacement of the hull-mounted sonar and diesel generators. This refit commenced in 2002, but problems with integrating the frigates' <b>anti-missile</b> and anti-torpedo detection and defence systems meant that when Sydney was finished in 2007, she was initially not accepted back into service. By November 2008, the problems with the upgrade had been solved.|$|E
25|$|Boorda was {{particularly}} interested in C4I initiatives to place command and control, communications, computers and intelligence assets on naval ships. Essentially this manifested itself as more robust combat information systems, with improved satellite and communication links, as well as place more defensive assets on traditionally non-combatant ships such as support vessels. Boorda initiated efforts during the proposal phase for the future LPD-17 amphibious class to be fitted with first-class C4I suites, radars, communications, and defense systems-anti-torpedo, <b>anti-missile,</b> and anti-NBC (nuclear, biological, and chemical) - along with blast-hardened bulkheads that will absorb and dissipate much more punishment than is possible with present designs. This effort was a departure from past efforts which relied on simply assigning a destroyer or cruiser to provide these functions for amphibious forces. The ship was commissioned January 14, 2006, nine years after Boorda's death.|$|E
25|$|The armed forces' {{primary concern}} at this time, {{according}} to the National Defense Report, {{is the possibility of}} an invasion by the PRC, consisting of a naval blockade, airborne assault, and/or missile bombardment. Four upgraded Kidd-class destroyers were purchased from the United States, and commissioned into the Republic of China Navy in 2005–2006, significantly upgrading Taiwan's air defence and submarine hunting abilities. The Ministry of National Defense planned to purchase diesel-powered submarines and Patriot <b>anti-missile</b> batteries from the United States, but its budget has been stalled repeatedly by the opposition-Pan-Blue Coalition controlled legislature. The defence package was stalled from 2001 to 2007 where it was finally passed through the legislature and the US responded on 3 October 2008, with a $6.5billion arms package including PAC III Anti-Air defence systems, AH-64D Apache Attack helicopters and other arms and parts. A significant amount of military hardware has been bought from the United States, and, , continues to be legally guaranteed by the Taiwan Relations Act. In the past, France and the Netherlands have also sold military weapons and hardware to the ROC, but they almost entirely stopped in the 1990s under pressure of the PRC.|$|E
500|$|Developed as {{the final}} line of defense (terminal defense or point defense) against anti-ship missiles, the Phalanx Close in Weapon System (CIWS, {{pronounced}} [...] "sea-whiz") is the anti-aircraft/anti-missile gun currently in use in the US Navy. Due to their distinctive shape, they have been nicknamed [...] "R2D2s", {{in reference to the}} droid R2-D2 from the Star Wars universe. Designed in the early 1970s by General Dynamics, and currently produced by Raytheon, the Phalanx CIWS mount utilizes a 20mm M61 Vulcan Gatling gun to destroy enemy missiles and aircraft that manage to escape <b>anti-missile</b> and anti-aircraft missiles fired from friendly ships.|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} {{speech on the}} Senate floor in March 1963, McGovern praised Kennedy's Alliance for Progress initiative, but spoke out against U.S.policy towards Cuba, saying that it {{suffered}} from [...] "our Castro fixation". In August 1963, McGovern advocated reducing the $53billion defense budget by $5 billion; influenced by advisor Seymour Melman, he held a special antipathy towards the doctrine of nuclear [...] "overkill". McGovern would try to reduce defense appropriations or limit military expenditures in almost every year during the 1960s. He also voted against many weapons programs, especially missile and <b>anti-missile</b> systems, and also opposed military assistance to foreign nations. In 1964 McGovern published his first book, War Against Want: America's Food for Peace Program. In it he argued for expanding his old program, and a Senate measure he introduced was eventually passed, adding $700million to the effort's funding.|$|E
