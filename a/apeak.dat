60|$|After {{they had}} gone on in this way a few minutes, Forester ordered the oars <b>apeak,</b> and put the crew at ease. When the oars are <b>apeak,</b> they are drawn in a little way, so that the handle of each oar may be passed under a sort of cleat or ledge, which runs along {{on the inside of}} the boat near the upper edge of it. This keeps the oar firm in its place without the {{necessity}} of holding it, the handle being under this cleat, while the middle of the oar rests in the row-lock. Thus the oarsmen are relieved from the necessity of holding their oars, and yet the oars are all ready to be seized again in a moment, whenever it becomes desirable to commence rowing.|$|E

60|$|It was on {{the first}} of February that we went on shore for the purpose of visiting the village. Although, as said before, we entertained not the {{slightest}} suspicion, still no proper precaution was neglected. Six men were left in the schooner, with instructions to permit none of the savages to approach the vessel during our absence, under any pretence whatever, and to remain constantly on deck. The boarding-nettings were up, the guns double-shotted with grape and canister, and the swivels loaded with canisters of musket-balls.

Otoo signed on before the mast; and for the next half-dozen years, in as many ships, we knocked about the wildest portions of Melanesia. Otoo saw to it that he always pulled stroke-oar in my boat. Our custom in recruiting labor was to land the recruiter on the beach. The covering boat always lay on its oars several hundred feet off shore, while the recruiter's boat, also lying on its oars, kept afloat {{on the edge of the}} beach. When I landed with my trade goods, leaving my steering sweep <b>apeak,</b> Otoo left his stroke position and came into the stern sheets, where a Winchester lay ready to hand under a flap of canvas.

60|$|Marco {{wished to}} have Forester teach the boys how to back water, and to trail oars, {{and to put}} the oars <b>apeak,</b> and to perform various other evolutions. But Forester was very slow in going on to new manoeuvers before the old ones were made {{perfectly}} familiar. He accordingly spent nearly an hour in rowing about the pond, up and down, to make the boys familiar with the stroke. He found, as is, in fact, universally the case with beginners {{in the art of}} rowing, that they were very prone to row faster and faster, that is, to accelerate their strokes, instead of rowing regularly, keeping continually the same time. They gradually improved, however, in respect to this fault, and {{by the middle of the}} afternoon Marco began to think that they were quite a good crew. They practiced several new evolutions during the latter part of the afternoon, and just before tea time they all went home, much pleased with the afternoon's enjoyment, and with the new knowledge and skill which they had acquired. They also planned another excursion the following week.|$|E
6000|$|There were no lighter hearts {{than those}} of Tom and Peter Scudamore on board the {{transport}} [...] "Nancy," [...] as, among the hearty cheers of the troops on board, and the waving of hats and handkerchiefs from friends who had come out in small boats to say good-bye for the last time, she weighed anchor, and set sail in company with some ten or twelve other transports, and under convoy of two ships of war. It {{would be difficult to}} imagine a prettier scene. The guns fired, the bands of the various regiments played, and the white sails opened out bright in the sun as the sailors swarmed into the rigging, anxious to outvie each other. Even the soldiers pulled and hauled at the ropes, and ran round with the capstan bars to get the anchors <b>apeak.</b> Tom and Peter, of course, had, like the other boys, got very much in the way in their desire to assist, and, having been once or twice knocked over by the rush of men coming along with ropes, they wisely gave it up, and leaned over the side to enjoy the scene.|$|E

While I was busy arguing and persuading the woolly-headed cannibals to come and labor on the Queensland plantations Otoo kept watch. And often and often his low voice warned me of suspicious actions and impending treachery. Sometimes it was the quick shot from his rifle, knocking a savage over, that was the first warning I received. And in my rush to the boat his hand was always there to jerk me flying aboard. Once, I remember, on Santa Anna, the boat grounded just as the trouble began. The covering boat was dashing to our assistance, but the several score of savages would have wiped us out before it arrived. Otoo took a flying leap ashore, dug both hands into the trade-goods, and scattered tobacco, beads, tomahawks, knives, and calicoes in all directions.|$|E
60|$|And I will say, here, that I {{would rather}} travel with an {{excursion}} party of Methuselahs than {{have to be}} changing ships and comrades constantly, as people do who travel in the ordinary way. Those latter are always grieving over some other ship they have known and lost, and over other comrades whom diverging routes have separated from them. They learn to love a ship {{just in time to}} change it for another, and they become attached to a pleasant traveling companion only to lose him. They have that most dismal experience of being in a strange vessel, among strange people who care nothing about them, and of undergoing the customary bullying by strange officers and the insolence of strange servants, repeated over and over again within the compass of every month. They have also that other misery of packing and unpacking trunks--of running the distressing gauntlet of custom-houses--of the anxieties attendant upon getting a mass of baggage from point to point on land in safety. I had rasher sail with a whole brigade of patriarchs than suffer so. We never packed our trunks but twice--when we sailed from New York, and when we returned to it. Whenever we made a land journey, we estimated how many days we should be gone and what amount of clothing we should need, figured it down to a mathematical nicety, packed a valise or two accordingly, and left the trunks on board. We chose our comrades from among our old, tried friends, and started. We were never dependent upon strangers for companionship. We often had occasion to pity Americans whom we found traveling drearily among strangers with no friends to exchange pains and pleasures with. Whenever we were coming back from a land journey, our eyes sought one thing in the distance first--the ship --and when we saw it riding at anchor with the flag <b>apeak,</b> we felt as a returning wanderer feels when he sees his home. When we stepped on board, our cares vanished, our troubles were at an end--for the ship was home to us. We always had the same familiar old state-room to go to, and feel safe and at peace and comfortable again.|$|E

40|$|Several reports {{describing}} Superconducting Fault Current Limiter (SFCL) containing {{members of}} the bismuth or yttrium ceramics were already described. However, none of these included the mercury and samarium cuprates. Consequently, we have conducted a study of a resistive-type superconductor fault current limiter based on Hg 0. 82 Re 0. 18 Ba 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 8 +d samples and SmBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -d ceramics. All polycrystalline samples were prepared by solid-state reaction method using commercial oxide and carbonate powders. The superconducting ceramic with 2. 4 × 2. 6 × 6. 0 mm³ dimensions was set up such that the electrical current flew through the area of 2. 6 × 6. 0 mm². All measurements were done at 77 K and without applied magnetic field (Happ = 0). In the case mercury sample, the fault current of 16. 1 <b>Apeak</b> was reduced to 8. 1 <b>Apeak</b> by the superconducting element and sustained for 100 ms. The prospective/limited of current ratio observed in this experiment was ~ 2. 0, as considered a 2. 4 mm pellet thickness. When the test was realized with the samarium sample, the prospective/limited current ratio observed was approximately 1. 2, for same ceramic thickness. The tests confirmed the capability of the resistive type SFCL to limit the fault current. These results open the possibility of future investigations into SFCL devices based on those superconducting ceramics in low power electronics and electrical motor...|$|E
40|$|Objetivo: Avaliar o desenvolvimento da Acuidade Visual (AV) de resolução de grades e a Sensibilidade ao Contraste (SC) de recém-nascidos de termo pequenos para a idade gestacional (PIG). Método: Medimos a AV e a SC de 126 recém-nascidos de termo com o potencial visual evocado de varredura (PVEv; Norcia & Tyler 1985). 73 recém-nascidos (Média de Idade = 11, 3 ± 4, 3 semanas) nasceram com o peso adequado para a idade gestacional - AIG (percentil 10; Alexander et al., 1996) e 53 recém-nascidos (Média de Idade = 9, 2 ± 3, 8 semanas) nasceram pequenos para a idade gestacional - PIG (percentil 10 th percentile; Alexander et al., 1996). 53 infants {{were born}} SGA (average age = 9. 2 ± 3. 8 weeks). sVEPs were {{measured}} using the PowerDiva system (Norcia & Tyler, 1985; Chen et al., 2005) which generated the stimuli and analyzed the evoked responses. The sVEP was recorded using 3 unipolar channels placed at O 1, Oz, and O 2 with a reference electrode at the vertex. Stimuli were vertical sinewave luminance gratings phase-reversing at 6 Hz {{with a mean}} luminance of 161 cd/m 2. To measure VA, spatial frequency (SF) was swept linearly from low to high during a 10 -second trial, generating ten 1 -sec time bins of sVEP data. Grating contrast was fixed at 80 % during the SF sweep. To evaluate CS, SF was fixed at 0. 5 c/deg, and contrast was increased logarithmically across 10 1 -sec recording epochs. The resulting sVEP data from both protocols {{were based on a}} vector average of a minimum of 3 sVEP trials. In addition to thresholds, we analyzed average noise (Nav), and 4 suprathreshold measures - peak amplitude (<b>Apeak),</b> signal-to-noise ratio at <b>Apeak</b> (SNRpeak), phase at <b>Apeak</b> (peak) and slope of the rising phase of the sVEP (m). The data used were those obtained from the recording channel generating the highest VA or CS while satisfying strict phase and amplitude criteria to ensure that the responses were reliable and significantly above the noise. Results: A Chi-squared test showed that a significant proportion of the young (9 weeks) SGA infants had values of VA and CS that were below the mean of control infants (with birthweights above the international 50 th percentile). In addition, mean Nav, <b>Apeak</b> and SNRpeak for the whole group of SGA infants were below the means of control infants across the whole age range tested. A factorial ANOVA confirmed that VA, CS, Nav and all the suprathreshold measures underwent significant development; that is, the mean values prior to 10 weeks were significantly different than the mean values between 10 and 24 weeks. In addition, the rate of development of peak was similar for the two groups as well as to prior phase-development data Hamer and Norcia (1994). Conclusions: Birth at term with weight small for gestational age appears to significantly affect development of both cortical grating acuity and contrast sensitivity for low-SF gratings. Effects on thresholds are most evident in the first 2 months. Moreover, the significant effects we found in Nav and suprathreshold amplitudes throughout the first 6 months of life show that, even if acuity and contrast thresholds are not affected, significant neuronal effects occur in the visual pathways leading to the sVEP signal (Mirabella et al., 2006...|$|E
