40|$|Introduction: To date it {{is unknown}} whether there are moderating {{variables}} for the associations between children’s self-reported screen time <b>and</b> <b>breaks</b> in screen time and objectively measured sedentary time <b>and</b> <b>breaks</b> in sedentary time. The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine whether the associations between self-reported screen time <b>and</b> <b>breaks</b> in screen time and accelerometer assessed sedentary time <b>and</b> <b>breaks</b> in sedentary time were moderated by gender, ethnicity, children’s moderate-to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), parents’ educational level, parents’ screen time <b>and</b> <b>breaks</b> in screen time and parents physical activity (PA). Methods: Screen time <b>and</b> <b>breaks</b> in screen time were assessed with questionnaires in a sample of 445 children (10 - 12 years) in Belgium, Greece, Hungary and Norway. Parents’ screen time, breaks in screen time, parents’ PA and demographics were also assessed with questionnaires. Accelerometers measured sedentary time per day <b>and</b> <b>breaks</b> in sedentary time per day and MVPA (children only). Bivariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were applied to assess the associations between the independent variables and the dependent variables. Interaction terms were added in the final model to examine whether the associations between self-reported screen time <b>and</b> <b>breaks</b> in screen time and accelerometer assessed sedentary time <b>and</b> <b>breaks</b> in sedentary time were moderated by the significant independent variables.

5|$|Cyanogenic glycosides {{are stored}} in {{inactive}} forms in plant vacuoles. They become toxic when herbivores eat the plant <b>and</b> <b>break</b> cell membranes allowing the glycosides to {{come into contact with}} enzymes in the cytoplasm releasing hydrogen cyanide which blocks cellular respiration. Glucosinolates are activated {{in much the same way}} as cyanogenic glucosides, and the products can cause gastroenteritis, salivation, diarrhea, and irritation of the mouth. Benzoxazinoids, secondary defence metabolites, which are characteristic for grasses (Poaceae), are also stored as inactive glucosides in the plant vacuole. Upon tissue disruption they get into contact with β-glucosidases from the chloroplasts, which enzymatically release the toxic aglucones. Whereas some benzoxazinoids are constitutively present, others are only synthesised following herbivore infestation, and thus, considered inducible plant defenses against herbivory.|$|E

5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena chlorophos {{are found in}} forests, where they grow in groups on woody debris such as fallen twigs, branches, and bark.

Experimental {{studies have shown that}} mushroom primordia that are too wet become deformed, while conditions that are too dry cause the caps to warp <b>and</b> <b>break</b> because the delicate gelatinous membrane covering them is broken.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This study aims at {{testing and}} {{comparing}} the tensile strength of bamboo and steel reinforcement bars as structural material for building construction. Tensile strength tests {{were carried out}} on various sizes steel and bamboo categories of reinforcement bars such as 10 mm 12 mm 16 mm 20 mm and 25 mm of both high-yield and mild-yield steel reinforcement bars were both tested along with same sizes of bamboo with 10 mm cross-sectional thickness. Results are presented in tables and graphs and show that the tensile strength of high-yield steel bars outstrips that of mild-yield and bamboo respectively. The study finds that the breaking force FB for 10 mm HY 24. 42 KN tensile strength 457. 13 Nmm 2 yield stress 379. 02 Nmm 2 <b>and</b> <b>breaking</b> elongation 39. 67 mm respectively. For 12 mm HY breaking force FB 52. 14 KN tensile strength 689. 12 Nmm 2 yield stress 551. 30 Nmm 2 <b>and</b> <b>breaking</b> elongation 36. 58 mm. 16 mm HY results in breaking force FB 126. 67 KN tensile strength 771. 61 Nmm 2 yield stress 494. 10 Nmm 2 <b>and</b> <b>breaking</b> elongation 70. 87 mm. The same factors for 20 mm yields breaking force FB 163. 97 KN tensile strength 713. 40 Nmm 2 yield stress 614. 74 Nmm 2 <b>and</b> <b>breaking</b> elongation 61. 57 mm. While the 25 mm HY produces breaking force FB 306. 17 KN tensile strength 792. 90 Nmm 2 yield stress 678. 46 Nmm 2 <b>and</b> <b>breaking</b> elongation 52. 36 mm respectively. Mild Steel MY 10 mm yields breaking force FB 14. 76 KN tensile strength 290. 49 Nmm 2 yield stress 233. 17 Nmm 2 <b>and</b> <b>breaking</b> elongation 78. 86 mm. 12 mm MY results in breaking force 40. 35 KN tensile strength 508. 08 Nmm 2 yield stress 376. 17 Nmm 2 <b>and</b> <b>breaking</b> elongation 84. 10 mm. 16 mm MY yields breaking force FB 79. 72 KN tensile strength 508. 71 Nmm 2 yield stress 349. 10 Nmm 2 <b>and</b> <b>breaking</b> elongation 111. 39 mm respectively. For 20 mm mild steel breaking force FB 83. 04 KN tensile strength 372. 98 Nmm 2 yield stress 284. 64 Nmm 2 <b>and</b> <b>breaking</b> elongation 47. 40 mm. While the 25 mm MY steel bar results show breaking force FB 163. 04 KN tensile strength 701. 74 Nmm 2 yield stress 599. 77 Nmm 2 <b>and</b> <b>breaking</b> elongation 56. 84 mm. On the other hand bamboo yields for the same size width and constant thickness of 10 mm the 10 mm- 25 mm bamboo sizes result as 10 mm bamboo breaking force FB - 2. 1 KN tensile strength 31. 55 Nmm 2 yield stress 0. 00 Nmm 2 <b>and</b> <b>breaking</b> elongation 0. 00 mm. 12 mm width with 10 mm thickness yields breaking force FB - 1. 28 KN tensile strength 31. 07 Nmm 2 yield stress 0. 00 Nmm 2 <b>and</b> <b>breaking</b> elongation 0. 00 mm. 16 mm bamboo breaking force 1. 85 KN tensile strength 68. 82 Nmm 2 yield stress 49. 45 Nmm 2 <b>and</b> <b>breaking</b> elongation 30. 40 mm. For the 20 mm width size bamboo with same 10 mm thickness breaking force FB - 0. 12 KN tensile strength 62. 66 Nmm 2 yield stress 50. 23 Nmm 2 <b>and</b> <b>breaking</b> elongation 18. 20 mm respectively. Finally the 25 mm bamboo size gives breaking force FB 4. 76 KN tensile strength 94. 60 Nmm 2 yield stress 50. 19 Nmm 2 <b>and</b> <b>breaking</b> elongation 21. 11 mm.
