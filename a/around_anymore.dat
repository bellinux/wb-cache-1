500|$|Nixon ran for Governor of California against {{incumbent}} Pat Brown, and {{was defeated}} handily, leading {{the media to}} label him as a [...] "loser." [...] This defeat was widely {{believed to be the}} end of his career; in an impromptu concession speech the morning after the election, Nixon famously blamed the media for favoring his opponent, saying, [...] "you won't have Nixon to kick <b>around</b> <b>anymore</b> because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference." [...] In September, the New York Post published an article claiming that campaign donors were buying influence with Nixon by providing him with a secret cash fund for his personal expenses. He moved to New York, joining the Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander & Ferdon law firm, and regrouped, considering but decided against a run for president in 1964, beginning to plan for a 1968 presidential campaign.|$|E
500|$|At the 19th Party Congress in 1952, Molotov {{was elected}} to the {{replacement}} for the Politburo, the Presidium, but was not listed among the members of the newly established secret body known as the Bureau of the Presidium; indicating that he had fallen out of Stalin's favour. At the 19th Congress, Molotov and Anastas Mikoyan were said by Stalin to have committed grave mistakes, including the publication of a wartime speech by Winston Churchill favourable to the Soviet Union's wartime efforts. Both Molotov and Mikoyan were falling out of favour rapidly, with Stalin telling Beria, Khrushchev, Malenkov and Nikolai Bulganin {{that he did not want}} to see Molotov and Mikoyan <b>around</b> <b>anymore.</b> At his 73rd birthday, Stalin treated both with disgust. In his speech to the 20th Party Congress in 1956, Khrushchev told delegates that Stalin had had plans for [...] "finishing off" [...] Molotov and Mikoyan in the aftermath of the 19th Congress.|$|E
500|$|Local and {{national}} Republican leaders encouraged Nixon to challenge incumbent Pat Brown for Governor of California in the 1962 election. Despite initial reluctance, Nixon entered the race. The campaign was clouded by public suspicion that Nixon viewed the {{office as a}} stepping-stone for another presidential run, some opposition from the far-right of the party, and his own {{lack of interest in}} being California's governor. Nixon hoped that a successful run would confirm him in his status as the nation's leading active Republican politician, and ensure he remained a major player in national politics. Instead, he lost to Brown by more than five percentage points, and the defeat was widely believed {{to be the end of}} his political career. In an impromptu concession speech the morning after the election, Nixon blamed the media for favoring his opponent, saying, [...] "You won't have Nixon to kick <b>around</b> <b>anymore</b> because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference". The California defeat was highlighted in the November 11, 1962, episode of ABC's [...] entitled [...] "The Political Obituary of Richard M. Nixon". Alger Hiss appeared on the program, and many members of the public complained that it was unseemly to allow a convicted felon air time to attack a former vice president. The furor drove Smith and his program from the air, and public sympathy for Nixon grew.|$|E
