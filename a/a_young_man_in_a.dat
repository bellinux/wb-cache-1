25|$|The same Greek word neaniskos (young man) {{is used in}} both Secret Mark and at Mark 14:51. If {{we accept}} Helmut Koester's theory that the {{canonical}} Mark is a revision of Secret Mark, another explanation is possible: namely, that the ancient editor who deleted an earlier encounter of Jesus with such <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cloth, then added this incident also involving a young man during Jesus' arrest.|$|E

25|$|Also {{known as}} The Finger Guy, Stephen (Pender) {{is a man}} who pretends to be pulling an object from his pocket but in facts flips off the person, {{followed}} by oohs and aahs. He generally performs this act to a figure of authority such as a bus ticket collector, a police woman, or a judge. Sometimes these sketches break character continuity. The character is generally depicted as <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gray hoodie but has also been portrayed as a politician and a medieval knight.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} victim {{linked to the}} Michigan Murderer was a 19-year-old Eastern Michigan University {{accounting}} student named Mary Terese Fleszar, who was last seen alive {{on the evening of}} July 9, 1967, by a neighbor walking towards her Ypsilanti apartment. This neighbor twice observed <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> blue-grey Chevrolet slow to a halt beside Fleszar and begin talking to her: each time, Fleszar had shook her head and walked away from the car. Her nude body was found by two 15-year-old boys on an abandoned farm in Superior Township on August 7, and was formally identified via dental records the following day.|$|E

In April 2014, the literary publisher Graywolf Press issued Franco's first collection of poetry, Directing Herbert White. The title alludes to a poem (made by Franco into a 2010 short film) by Frank Bidart, who has served as friend and mentor to Franco.|$|E

500|$|... "Not to everyone's taste, granted, [...] is {{nevertheless}} an original and disturbing take on modern love stories" [...] was {{the view of}} Stuart Willis writing for the Sex-Gore-Mutants website. Believing that the film was a [...] "pleasant surprise", he praised the improvised nature of the work, believing that it created believable scenes and allowed the viewer {{to get to know}} the characters [...] "almost without realising." [...] He considered the acting to be very good, and particularly praised Hoyle's ability to portray a paedophile grooming <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way that was both [...] "pathetic and truly sinister all at once". Rather than falling into [...] "tasteless exploitation", Willis thought that the film was saved by a lack of sensationalism. Praising the exterior scenes as [...] "beautifully atmospheric" [...] and the music as [...] "fitting the laconic mood and sense of ill-foreboding well", he considered the film to be a good example of low-key filmmaking, akin to that produced in Britain during the early 1980s.|$|E

2500|$|The tale {{can be read}} as {{the social}} and sexual {{maturation}} of <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> brutal world.

2500|$|In Mark 14:51-52, <b>a</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> linen cloth is seized during Jesus' arrest, but he escapes at {{the cost}} of his clothing. This passage seems to {{have little to do with}} the rest of the narrative, and it has given cause to various interpretations. Often it is {{suggested}} that the young man is Mark himself. Some commentators believe that the boy was a stranger, who lived near the garden and, after being awakened, ran out, half-dressed, to see what all the noise was about (vv. 46-49). W. L. Lane thinks that Mark mentioned this episode in order to make it clear that [...] "all (not only the disciples) fled, leaving Jesus alone in the custody of the police." ...|$|E

In 1853, they started their first missionary journal, The Missionary Reporter. In 1859, the religious revival which reached Britain had a transforming effect on many of the assemblies and brought in new leaders such as Joseph Denham Smith.
