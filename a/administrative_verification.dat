40|$|To {{improve the}} public {{administration}} {{and control of}} timber production in its biodiversity-rich forests, in 2000 Ecuador implemented {{the development of an}} innovative scheme: the Outsourced National Forest Control System. The system was based on three components: (i) Vigilancia Verde, a government-civil society body responsible for policing the road transport of forest products; (ii) the Regentes Forestales, professional foresters with public responsibility for monitoring legality in the forest; and (iii) the outsourcing to a private company of <b>administrative</b> and <b>verification</b> services. The innovation and early achievements of this system attracted worldwide attention but, in 2002, the implementation of the third component engendered fierce opposition within the country. In October 2003, Ecuador’s Constitutional Tribunal ruled against the component, leading to its suspension and the overall weakening of the system. This paper describes the contextual factors that {{led to the development of}} the Outsourced National Forest Control System, its specific legislation and architecture, and the main reasons for its fall. 1...|$|R
40|$|The IPsec {{protocol}} {{provides a}} mechanism to enforce a range of security services for both confidentiality and integrity, enabling secure transmission of information across networks. Dynamic parameterization of IPsec, via the KeyNote trust management system, further enables security mechanisms to adjust the level of security service “on-the-fly ” to respond to changing network and operational conditions. However KeyNote requires that an IPsec policy be defined in the KeyNote specification syntax. Defining such a dynamic security policy in the KeyNote Policy Specification language is complicated {{and can lead to}} incorrect specification of the desired policy, thus degrading the security of the network. We present an alternative XML representation of this language and a graphical user interface to create and manage a consistent and correct security policy. The interface has the simplicity of a simple menu-driven editor that not only provides KeyNote with a policy in the specified syntax but also integrates techniques to support <b>administrative</b> policy <b>verification...</b>|$|R
40|$|Addressing Britain's National Farmers' Union, Commissioner Fischler {{highlighted}} how 90 % of EU citizens believe ensuring {{food safety}} and food hygiene is an important function of agricultural policy. It is against this background that the EU has been adopting 'a range of measures to make legislation even stricter'. However, Commissioner Fischler highlighted the need for EU member states to ensure the new regulations were strictly enforced. Comment: In the short term, ACP exporters of food products will need to invest not only in meeting EU regulatory standards but also in ensuring that the <b>administrative</b> arrangements for <b>verification</b> of compliance are efficient and comprehensive if new obstacles to ACP trade are not to emerge. In the medium term, ACP governments will need to launch {{a dialogue with the}} EU on how EU food safety concerns can be addressed without placing an undue economic burden on small scale ACP exporters, given the high fixed costs which compliance with SPS standards can impose. Addressing Britain's National Farmers' Union, Commissioner Fischler [...] ...|$|R
