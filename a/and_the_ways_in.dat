He begins to compose a letter back, describing his experiences with the crew, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which humans are different. Meanwhile, on the Bridge, the crew are discussing a pre-warp vessel they have encountered. The alien they speak with, a Valakian, begs them to assist with a medical emergency their species is facing. Sub-Commander T'Pol reveals that the Vulcans are unaware of the species, but she agrees with Captain Archer to help them. Phlox continues his letter, describing the challenges of treating the disease – with over fifty million lives at stake.|$|E

Later and current feminists have questioned whether gender equality has actually been fully achieved, and discuss current gender problems, such as the large gender disparity in the population.|$|E
25|$|Season two of Buffy {{and season}} four of Angel feature storylines in which, {{deprived}} of his soul, he resumes his Angelus persona and torments and kills {{some of his}} allies. Academic literature concerning the character has often focused on the implications of Angel's dichotomous personality in {{the presence or absence}} of his soul, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which his relationship with Buffy conforms to and subverts the tropes of romantic drama and horror fiction.|$|E

25|$|While HPP and the Conditioned Headturn Procedure {{allow for}} {{observations}} of behavioral responses to stimuli {{and after the}} fact inferences about what the subject's expectations must have been to motivate this behavior, the Anticipatory Eye Movement paradigm allows researchers to directly observe a subject's expectations before the event occurs. By tracking subjects' eye movements researchers {{have been able to}} investigate infant decision-making <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which infants encode and act on probabilistic knowledge to make predictions about their environments. This paradigm also offers the advantage of comparing differences in eye movement behavior across a wider range of ages than others.|$|E
25|$|In {{pursuit of}} a more nuanced {{approach}} {{to the history of}} Polish-Jewish relations that includes Jewish recognition of Polish losses suffered during World War II, the WJC's Research Institute published two monographs which explored the attempts to revive Polish Jewry <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which Poles and Jews have confronted their common history. Moreover, the Israel Council on Foreign Relations, which operates {{under the auspices of the}} World Jewish Congress, together with the Polish Institute for International Affairs, held two successive conferences (one in Warsaw in 2009 and the other in Jerusalem in 2010) to discuss bilateral relations and international issues of mutual concern.

25|$|Feminist {{communication}} theory also encompasses {{access to the}} public sphere, whose voices are heard in that sphere, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which the field of communication studies has limited what is regarded as essential to public discourse. The recognition of a full history of women orators overlooked and disregarded by the field has effectively become an undertaking of recovery, as it establishes and honors the existence of women in history and lauds the communication by these historically significant contributors. This recovery effort, begun by Andrea Lunsford, Professor of English and Director of the Program in Writing and Rhetoric at Stanford University and followed by other feminist communication theorists also names women such as Aspasia, Diotima, and Christine de Pisan, who were likely influential in rhetorical and communication traditions in classical and medieval times, but who have been negated as serious contributors to the traditions.|$|E

500|$|In {{the second}} chapter, [...] "The Magical Self", Berger {{examines}} {{the ways in}} which Wiccans in the U.S. understand themselves, looking at sociological ideas about self-identity and utilising them in her analysis of Wiccan rituals that deal with the transformation of the self. She moves on to look at concepts of gender in the Wiccan community, both for men and women and among homosexuals. The third chapter, entitled [...] "The Coven: Perfect Love, Perfect Trust", provides an explanation of the coven system within Wicca, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which friendships are built and collapse amongst coven members, {{and the extent to which}} covens imitate family structures.|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{functions}} of botanical gardens have already been discussed in the sections above, which emphasise the scientific underpinning of botanical gardens with their focus on research, education and conservation. However, as multifaceted organisations, all sites have their own special interests. In a remarkable paper {{on the role of}} botanical gardens, Ferdinand Mueller (1825–1896), the director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne (1852–1873), stated, [...] "in all cases the objects [...] must be mainly scientific and predominantly instructive". He then detailed many of the objectives being pursued by the world's botanical gardens {{in the middle of the}} 19th century, when European gardens were at their height. Many of these are listed below to give a sense of the scope of botanical gardens' activities at that time, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which they differed from parks or what he called [...] "public pleasure gardens": ...|$|E
500|$|Farsari {{and other}} 19th-century {{commercial}} photographers generally concentrated on {{two types of}} subject matter: the scenery of Japan and the [...] "manners and customs" [...] of its inhabitants. Such subjects, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which they were literally and figuratively framed, were chosen to appeal to foreign taste; {{and the reason for}} this, apart from the photographer's individual aesthetics, vision and preconceptions, {{had much to do with}} economics. Photographs were expensive to make and accordingly expensive to buy. In 1870s Japan, a portrait photograph usually cost half a ryō [...] "per head", about a month's pay for an artisan. Given such pricing, few Japanese could afford photographs and a photographer's clientele was largely drawn from the foreign residents of the European and American enclaves: colonial administrators, missionaries, merchants and the military. By the early 1870s, tourists had joined their number. To appeal to this clientele, photographers often staged and contrived the scenes they photographed, particularly the portraits depicting [...] "manners and customs".|$|E

500|$|From The New York Times, {{reviewer}} Jon Caramanica, {{wrote that}} The Smeezingtons [...] "ve got {{a firm grip}} on the full spectrum of black pop, and white pop as well".

In an analepsis, before Mars played at the Super Bowl Half-time show, Idolator critic Kathy Iandoli praised The Smeezingtons' work, in the single by Sugababes [...] "Get Sexy", calling them [...] "a crew of talented fellas". Erik Adams, music critic, of The A.V. Club, criticized the production team by saying [...] "If The Smeezingtons want to keep synthesizing yesterday’s favorites into today’s hits...I could find it within myself to stomach Mars on more than one night of the year", referring to [...] "their work on Cee-Lo’s [...] "Fuck You"" [...] as proof.|$|E
500|$|According to Payne, Le Guin {{does not}} {{explicitly}} criticize {{the concept of}} religion in general, but the tendency within religion to reduce [...] "reality" [...] to that which can be contained and controlled by the human mind. This [...] "control" [...] is only possible within the entirely human-made environment aboard the spacecraft, which Le Guin depicts as lacking elements of the [...] "richly textured" [...] real world, and which denies human beings the experiences of [...] "wildness" [...] which make life interesting. In Payne's view the story challenges the idea, common to Western society, that human beings, and technology, can solve all problems; it does so by presenting an entire planet as a system not amenable to control. A 2002 review in Salon magazine also highlighted the religious themes in the story, stating that Le Guin offered an unusual take {{on the theme of}} religion by depicting a [...] "cult of atheists" [...] fed by the tendency to religious conformity among human beings. Scholar Max Haiven also said that [...] "Paradises Lost" [...] demonstrated the human need for myth and spirituality, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>in</b> which power structures could arise even in societies planned with the intent of avoiding them. According to Haiven, the zeroth generation made the mistake of assuming that they could create a completely rational society; instead, the emerging system of religion brought with it coercion and patriarchal standards of behavior.|$|E
