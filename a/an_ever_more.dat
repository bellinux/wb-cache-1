5|$|Over {{the course}} of the late Republic, {{formerly}} authoritative institutions lost their credibility and authority. For example, the Sullan reforms to the Senate strongly split the aristocratic class between those who stayed in the city and those who rose to high office abroad, further increasing class divides between Romans, even at the highest levels. Furthermore, the dominance of the military in the late Republic, along with stronger ties between a general and his troops, caused by their longer terms of service together and the troops' reliance on that general to provide for their retirements, along with an obstructionist central government, meant a huge number of malcontent soldiers willing to take up arms against the state. Adding in the institutionalisation of violence as a means to obstruct or force political change (e.g. the deaths of the Gracchi and Sulla's dictatorship, respectively), the Republic was caught in <b>an</b> <b>ever</b> <b>more</b> violent and anarchic struggle between the Senate, assemblies at Rome, and the promagistrates. It would only be resolved by civil war, a war which the promagistrate governors and their troops would win, and in doing so, collapse the Republic.|$|E

Principal tourist attractions include the Perito Moreno glacier, the Valdés Peninsula, the Argentine Lake District and Ushuaia and Tierra del Fuego (the city is also a jumping off place for travel to Antarctica, bringing in still more visitors).

25|$|Blackletter (also {{known as}} Gothic) and its {{variation}} Rotunda, gradually {{developed from the}} Carolingian hand during the 12th century.

During the 15th century, Italian scribes returned to the Roman and Carolingian models of writing and designed the Italic hand, also called Chancery cursive, and Roman bookhand. These three hands — Gothic, Italic, and Roman bookhand — became the models for printed letters. Johannes Gutenberg used Gothic to print his famous Bible, but the lighter-weight Italic and Roman bookhand have since become the standard.|$|E
25|$|As queen, {{the young}} Isabella faced {{numerous}} challenges.

Edward found himself {{at odds with}} the barons, too, in particular his first cousin Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, whilst continuing the war against the Scots that he had inherited from Edward I. Using her own supporters at court, and the patronage of her French family, Isabella attempted to find a political path through these challenges; she successfully formed an alliance with Gaveston, but after his death {{at the hands of the}} barons her position grew increasingly precarious. Edward began to take revenge on his enemies, using <b>an</b> <b>ever</b> <b>more</b> brutal alliance with the Despenser family, in particular his new favourite, Hugh Despenser the younger.

Through four comparative case studies, this dissertation demonstrates how various forms of user-generated content are employed in the digital performance of gender and sexuality. Far from being immaterial, disembodied, or cut off from the physical conditions of everyday life, it is argued that the internet exists of ‘digitally material’ spaces and artifacts that contain multiple traces of the embodied users who shape and inhabit them. As such, this dissertation offers a new way to make sense of how gender, sexuality, and embodiment are made to ‘matter’ on the internet...|$|R

2500|$|The {{original}} {{concept is}} a deliberate inversion or update of the Tarzan mythos, the syndicated comic strip which Russ Manning had previously illustrated.
