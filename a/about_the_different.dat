5|$|Much {{is written}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> factors that {{threaten}} the painted turtle, {{but they are}} unquantified, with only inferences of relative importance. A primary threat category is habitat loss in various forms. Related to water habitat, there is drying of wetlands, clearing of aquatic logs or rocks (basking sites), and clearing of shoreline vegetation, which allows more predator access or increased human foot traffic. Related to nesting habitat, urbanization or planting can remove needed sunny soils.|$|E
5|$|Nomadic {{hunter-gatherer}} societies passed on, by oral tradition, {{what they}} knew (their empirical observations) <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> kinds of plants that they used for food, shelter, poisons, medicines, for ceremonies and rituals etc. The uses of plants by these pre-literate societies influenced the way the plants were named and classifiedtheir uses were embedded in folk-taxonomies, {{the way they were}} grouped according to use in everyday communication. The nomadic life-style was drastically changed when settled communities were established in about twelve centres around the world during the Neolithic Revolution which extended from about 10,000 to 2500 years ago depending on the region. With these communities came the development of the technology and skills needed for the domestication of plants and animals and the emergence of the written word provided evidence for the passing of systematic knowledge and culture {{from one generation to the}} next.|$|E

Pliny (c. 77 CE) talks <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> items imported by the Romans from India and complains about the financial drain caused by them.

The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (c. 60 - 100 CE) an anonymous work, gives an elaborate description of the Tamil country and the riches of a 'Pandian Kingdom'.|$|E
25|$|In early wine history, the amphora was {{the vessel}} {{of choice for}} the storage and {{transportation}} of wine. Due to the perishable nature of wood material {{it is difficult to}} trace the usage of barrels in history. The Greek historian Herodotus noted that ancient Mesopotamians used barrels made of palm wood to transport wine along the Euphrates. Palm is a difficult material to bend and fashion into barrels, however, and wine merchants in different regions experimented with different wood styles to find a better wood source. The use of oak has been prevalent in winemaking for at least two millennia, first coming into widespread use {{during the time of the}} Roman Empire. In time, winemakers discovered that beyond just storage convenience, wine kept in oak barrels took on properties that improved it by making it softer and, in some cases, better-tasting. Robert Mondavi is credited with expanding the knowledge of winemakers in the United States <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> types of oak and barrel styles through his experiments in the 1960s and '70s.|$|E

The first 50 articles describe the jurisdiction and competence, composition and internal procedures of the court. Then follow the articles governing the work of the procureur-generaal (sollicitor-general) and advocaat-fiscaal (attorney-general) (art. LI-LXIII). Next follow articles regarding the griffier (Clerk of court) and secretaries (art. LXIV-XCIII). Then follow rules governing the competence and procedure of the court (XCIV-CIV), directly followed by rules about the way the bailiffs would execute the decrees of the court (CV-CXX). Then follow rules about the division of work between procureurs (sollicitors) and advocaten (attorneys, barristers), and the tariff for their services (CXXI-CLXVI), followed by rules about the procedures during trials (CLXVII-CXC). And finally details <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> legal remedies to be sought before the court were given (CXCI-CLXXXXIX).|$|E

500|$|... "Get Together" [...] {{incorporates}} {{elements from}} Stardust's [...] "Music Sounds Better with You" [...] which also contain samples of Chaka Khan's song [...] "Fate". It also refers to Madonna's own songs like [...] "Holiday" [...] (1983) and [...] "Secret" [...] (1994).

[...] Harris continued about his character's subsequent suicide: [...] "When Matt told me [...] idea, I laughed my ass off. When he said the car doesn't start, I just laughed for about five minutes.

500|$|A {{major theme}} {{in the book is}} the {{characterization}} of child abuse. The story follows Bruce Wayne as he learns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> categories of child abuse, from the ignorant to the incapable and to those who do it for pleasure. Batman, whose motivation is to prevent crimes like the murder of his parents, is contrasted against a social worker whose motivation is protecting children; Batman realizes that throughout his career he had been fighting criminals, not crime. Vachss asserts that [...] "child protection and crime prevention are the same thing"; he believes that child abuse is never just a random crime but is done with intent. While Vachss warns that those abused can become future abusers, he also states that [...] "abuse can push two similarly maltreated children in opposite directions. One incest victim becomes a promiscuous adult, another never engages in sex again. ... If you excuse a serial killer because he was tortured as a child, you disrespect the thousands of children who were treated worse and never imitated their oppressor." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Hair" [...] was {{recorded}} mostly while Gaga was on tour in Europe, but the mixing {{was done by}} Gene Grimaldi at Oasis Mastering in [...] Burbank, California. It is a Hi-NRG song and begins with Gaga singing the line [...] "Whenever I dress cool, my parents put up a fight/ And if I'm a hot shot, Mom will cut my hair at night/ And in the morning I'm short of my identity/ I scream, 'Mom and Dad, why can't I be who I want to be?" [...] As the music grows louder, Gaga sings the sing along chorus of the song, gradually moving towards the breakdown—which is inspired by retro music—talking <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> hairstyles she has had. Jocelyn Vena from MTV described the track as a [...] "fist-pumping, defiant disco track all about having a good time." [...] Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone called it a mixture of yearning romantic melodrama of [...] "We Belong" [...] with the hard industrial metal edge of Broken-era Nine Inch Nails. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune felt that Gaga's vocals are Auto-Tuned throughout the song. The lyrics of [...] "Hair" [...] talk about embracing one's hairstyle as the ultimate expression of their identity, hence it ends with Gaga triumphantly declaring [...] "I am my hair!"
