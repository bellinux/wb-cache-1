5|$|Beamer {{himself was}} {{the object of}} some off-field {{controversy}} when Georgia considered offering him its head football coaching job during the days prior to the Sugar Bowl. Beamer denied <b>any</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the position, and the controversy abated when Georgia hired Glen Mason as its head coach on December 18. Mason later changed his mind, and Georgia hired Jim Donnan instead.|$|E
5|$|Bessell {{noted that}} Thorpe, {{for all his}} gregariousness and warmth, {{appeared}} to have no female friends and lacked <b>any</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> girls. The former Liberal MP Frank Owen confided to Bessell his suspicions that Thorpe was a homosexual; other West Country Liberals had formed the same opinion. Aware that exposure as a homosexual would end Thorpe's career, Bessell became his self-appointed protector, even to the extent, he later said, of falsely claiming to be bisexual, {{as a means of}} acquiring his friend's confidence.|$|E
5|$|Having {{just been}} elected to the Senate with Sherman's support, Garfield entered the 1880 {{campaign}} season committed to Sherman as his choice for the Republican presidential nominee. Even before the convention began, however, a few Republicans, including Wharton Barker of Philadelphia, thought Garfield {{the best choice for}} the nomination. Garfield denied <b>any</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the position, but the attention was enough to make Sherman suspicious of his lieutenant's ambitions. Besides Sherman, the early favorites for the nomination were Blaine and former president Grant, but several other candidates attracted delegates as well.|$|E

5|$|Rutherford's {{relationship}} with organized labour was never easy. Historian L.G. Thomas {{argued that there}} was little indication that Rutherford had <b>any</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> courting the labour vote. In 1908, Labour candidate Donald McNabb was elected in a Lethbridge by-election; the riding had previously been held by a Liberal. McNabb was the first Labour MLA elected in Alberta (he was defeated in his 1909 re-election bid).|$|E
5|$|Another {{traditionally}} respected {{group which}} Joehana criticizes is the hajjis, those Muslims {{who have been}} on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The hajjis in Joehana's stories are generally greedy and lustful, without <b>any</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the good of humanity. In Tjarios Agan Permas, for instance, Hajji Serbanna displays his hypocrisy by damning usury as haraam (sinful) while charging high interest rates for a loan, and refuses to complete the mandatory prayers because he is waiting on a guest bearing large gifts. The hajji is portrayed as wearing so much make-up that, in the opinion of Kartini et al., it is as if he is deliberately dressing as a clown.|$|E
5|$|During the 1934–35 offseason, Ruth {{circled the}} world with his wife; the trip {{included}} a barnstorming tour of the Far East. At his final stop in the United Kingdom before returning home, Ruth was introduced to cricket by Australian player Alan Fairfax, and after having little luck in a cricketer's stance, stood as a baseball batter and launched some massive shots around the field, destroying the bat in the process. Although Fairfax regretted {{that he could not}} have the time to make Ruth a cricket player, Ruth had lost <b>any</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> such a career upon learning that the best batsmen made only about $40 per week.|$|E

5|$|Harrison was unpopular {{with the}} party and the country, and many of Blaine’s old {{supporters}} encouraged him to run for the nomination. Blaine had denied <b>any</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the nomination months before his resignation, but some of his friends, including Senator Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania and James S. Clarkson, chairman of the Republican National Committee, took it for false modesty and worked for his nomination anyway. When Blaine resigned from the cabinet, his boosters were certain that he was a candidate, but the majority of the party stood by the incumbent. Harrison was renominated on the first ballot, but die-hard Blaine delegates still gave their champion 182 and 1/6 votes, good enough for second place.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s Highland Airways {{looked into the}} {{possibility}} of including Stroma in the hospital ambulance plane service that was then in operation. On 19 August 1937, Captain Fresson of Highland Airways landed a small aircraft in farmland adjoining the Mains of Stroma, and the following spring the islanders cleared an area of moorland {{on the west side}} of the island to create an airstrip. The first official flight landed in June 1938. However, the Second World War prevented any further developments and a regular service was not established. After the war, Highland Airways was taken over by British European Airways, which abandoned <b>any</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> serving the island.|$|E
5|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was challenged}} by David Carpenter two years later, in 1985. Montfort {{had no intention}} to compromise with the royalists at all, according to Carpenter. In Carpenter's version of events, the Mise of Lewes was written while the battle was still ongoing, not after the battle was over, as previously assumed. This put Montfort {{in a situation where}} concessions were necessary, in order to bring hostilities to a halt as soon as possible. Once the battle was over and government in Montfort's hands, he had no longer <b>any</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> reaching a compromise with the royalists, and that was why hostilities continued. This dating of the document, however, has later been disputed by D. W. Burton, who maintains that the document was in fact signed after the battle was concluded.|$|E

5|$|As of 2008, Del Piero has captained Italy {{seven times}} (including during UEFA Euro 2008). He also {{initially}} regularly wore the number 10 shirt, in particular under Maldini and Zoff, but later {{gave it to}} Totti after Euro 2000, and switched to No. 7 for the 2002 World Cup, {{as it was the}} first number he wore at the start of his career. Even though the number 10 shirt was vacated after Totti retired from the national team in July 2007, Del Piero denied <b>any</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> taking back the number, saying he was satisfied with No. 7. In May, he was recalled by popular demand to Italy's UEFA Euro 2008 squad in Austria and Switzerland under manager Roberto Donadoni, after a nine-month absence from international duty, and thus became the second Italian player, after Paolo Maldini, to participate in seven major international tournaments (Euro 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008; World Cup 1998, 2002, 2006).|$|E
5|$|In The Simpsons twentieth {{episode of}} the twentieth season, Four Great Women and a Manicure is loosely based on Macbeth. In the third act of the episode, Marge embodies Lady Macbeth, an ambitious wife who is {{frustrated}} by everything around her. She not only has to clean the costumes worn by other actors, but is also frustrated {{over the fact that}} Homer doesn't have <b>any</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> auditioning for lead roles and would rather play a tree. She convinces him to kill Sideshow Mel and he does to assume the lead role of Macbeth. When Marge learns that no one cares for Homer's lack of acting skills over Hibbert's and those with no lines, she forces him to kill off everyone else until he's the only actor left. The angry spirits visit her that night and she tries to pin the blame on Homer. They refuse to believe Marge by pointing out that they knew he was a victim in her devious plans and get their revenge on her by killing her in a fright induced heart attack. Even though Homer gives Marge's ghost a promising performance, he eventually frustrates her more by killing himself so he doesn't have to audition for more Shakespearean plays. This forces Marge to learn her lesson the hard way when she must spend eternity with a lazy and happy Homer.|$|E

25|$|In April 1869, Joseph W.

President Grant, initially, did not have <b>any</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> annexation.

25|$|Joe Lieberman, another notable {{member of}} the DLC, {{endorsed}} Republican Senator John McCain for the presidency in 2008, citing his agreement with McCain's stance on the War on Terrorism as {{the primary reason for}} his support.

However, Lieberman denied <b>any</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> this role and Alaska Governor Sarah Palin was ultimately selected to be McCain's running mate.|$|E
