5000|$|At home, Donnelly {{prepares to}} kill himself. He {{looks in the}} gun which {{contains}} two bullets. As {{he is about to}} shoot himself, he hears scratching sounds from David, his wife's pet rabbit. He takes David in his lap, and tells the rabbit: [...] "I'll be following you shortly", before shooting it in the head. Moving the gun to his own head, Donnelly fumbles and drops it, accidentally discharging its last bullet. He looks at the smoking six shooter, then at the dead rabbit in his arms. He sighs, looks skyward and moans, [...] "Oh Jesus; what <b>a</b> <b>fuckin</b> day." ...|$|E

It was meant to promote the live album Live @ the Echoplex: December 7th, 2007 and <b>Fuckin</b> <b>A</b> from four years prior. [...] "Goddamn the Light" [...] served as the single's b-side.|$|R
5000|$|The album {{contains}} numerous {{references to}} several {{films such as}} Repo Man in [...] "Eyes Pop - Skin Explodes - Everybody Dead" [...] is a line spoken by the character J. Frank Parnell, and the track [...] "It's My Mind That Works" [...] samples Miller saying [...] "you know how everybody's into weirdness right now" [...] and [...] "it's {{all part of a}} cosmic unconsciousness."

5000|$|Perrino was {{in regular}} contact with Bonanno crime family underboss Salvatore Vitale {{to whom he}} handed over the weekly {{proceeds}} from their racketeering ventures. When law enforcement finally came down on the newspapers crooked workforce, Perrino was not arrested or indicted although Bonanno crime family members and several others {{were caught in the}} sting operation - making Salvatore Vitale nervous. A secret video camera placed in Perrinos office in late 1991 caught Perrino discussing his important role in the Bonanno crime family. It also taped Perrino and other Post employees discussing the finer points of bootlegging, newspaper theft and passing around loaded pistols to admire. Perrino was heard advising truck drivers, [...] "Its bad to carry <b>a</b> <b>fuckin</b> piece in the car, youll have to shoot everybody," [...] as reported in [...] "The Newspaper Racket: Tough Guys and Wiseguys in the Truck Drivers Union" [...] in The Village Voice. Although Salvatore Vitale had not been named in the initial indictments, he thought that Perrino could become an informant because of his immense involvement with the rackets at the New York Post. Perrinos father-in-law, Nicholas Marangello, was incarcerated for racketeering {{as a result of the}} Donnie Brasco investigation at the time of his execution. Two of Perrinos executive co-workers, including his friend Director of Circulation, Anthony Michele, pleaded guilty to racketeering. A number of Bonanno crime family connected members of the Newspaper Mail Deliverers Union later pleaded guilty to a variety of charges and were imprisoned at Rikers Island. Salvatore Vitale suggested that Richard Cantarella replace Perrino shortly before the racketeering investigation was revealed.|$|E
5000|$|In 1998, {{following}} {{a number of}} personnel changes, the band released the 21-track double LP, <b>A</b> Bridge Too <b>Fuckin</b> Far. The album was dedicated to original guitarist Jack Taylor who had recently died of a drug overdose. This album was followed in 1999 by Love Always Wins, an album primarily of cover songs which is widely {{considered to be the}} bands most accessible album to date.|$|R
5000|$|The Thermals came {{together}} in 2002 with Hutch Harris and Kathy Foster, former band mates, and most notably in the folk duo Hutch & Kathy. Their first album, More Parts per Million, was released in 2003 by Sub Pop Records. The album was recorded and performed entirely by Hutch Harris, who played every instrument. The first live line-up was Harris with Kathy Foster on bass, Jordan Hudson (also of M. Ward and The operacycle) on drums and Ben Barnett on guitar [...] Their follow-up album <b>Fuckin</b> <b>A</b> was mixed by Death Cab For Cutie member Chris Walla. During that period Ben Barnett left the band and Hutch Harris took over the role as guitarist.|$|R
5000|$|During this time, rappers were {{beginning}} to get {{fed up with the}} lack of creative control given to the artists by their record labels. An indie rap movement began to flourish with Rawkus Records at the helm. Eventually, Natural Elements acquired a record deal with a major label, Tommy Boy Records. In 1998, N.E. released their first single [...] "2 Tons/Live It Up" [...] under their indie division called Tommy Boy Black Label. [...] All three members put out various solo work, but no official albums were ever released as Tommy Boy dropped them soon after due to issues between the group and label. The Natural Elements debut album which was due to release was then shelved in spite of the hype it accumulated. In an interview, Mr. Voodoo stated [...] "The Tommy Boy situation was hectic. We was [...] to have an album put out in 1999. First, halfway through the album our A&R was fired. We still were still on and finished the album but they kept sitting on it. We were like let us go but give us our masters. So we got 'em. <b>A</b> whole <b>fuckin</b> album that no one may ever hear." [...] An unfinished and unofficial copy of the album with assorted songs eventually leaked onto the Internet, and thus received mixed reviews. The group eventually took a small hiatus and disbanded due to personal issues.|$|R
