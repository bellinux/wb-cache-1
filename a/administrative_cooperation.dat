40|$|This paper {{describes}} the initial {{establishment of a}} business-to-business network in a novel context – within and around a government department as it implements Purchaser-Provider relationships. A popular reform in public sector management over {{recent years has been}} the establishment of internal competition to increase efficiency and effectiveness under a "Purchaser-Provider" model. We applied the International and Industrial Marketing Purchasing (IMP) framework to capture some of the major transitions occurring within and around this organisation. We found the IMP approach useful for capturing the dynamic emerging structures. Just like relationships in private-sector business, Purchaser-Provider tends to operate as a network, with a mix of cooperation and competition, rather than competition alone. The public-sector context is unusual in that the network has been established by moving from an <b>administrative</b> control structure, <b>cooperation</b> alone, rather than from an open market, with competition alone.

30|$|Furthermore, the {{existence}} of urban movements can, in certain circumstances, significantly enhance institutional action that has transformative aims. The network of associations and social innovation initiatives that have emerged in recent years {{can be a powerful}} ally and effective collaborator in pushing ahead policies and running services. The joint formulation and implementation of policies between citizens’ organizations and public administrations can improve the efficiency and democratic quality of <b>administrative</b> processes. Moreover, <b>cooperation</b> with community initiatives can reinforce institutions that have become circumscribed and weakened in administrative, economic and political terms. There are still considerable risks involved, however: on the one hand, cronyism can arise between institutions and citizens’ groups; on the other, it is important to prevent the delegation of managing services to society from becoming an excuse for a progressive withdrawal of the public administrations. Following this path could lead, however paradoxically, to a place not far removed from the New Localism or Big Society advocated by the British Conservatives.|$|R

40|$|The {{contexts}} in which educational innovation originates and develops are manifold: classroom, school, administration, community…, and its protagonists, that is, the people who plan and implement it. This paper presents an approach {{to the analysis of}} the innovative experiences in primary and secondary schools based on the memory of these held by students from the Bachelor’s/Degree in Education. The analysis provides a range of suggestions for possible improvements in teaching and is also a good exercise for stimulating the capacity for reflection of future teachers and educators in their training process. The perspective of the main agents in teaching and learning not only provides relevant information about the reality experienced but also about the personal involvement of teachers and students. Ethnographic research in this work appears through the autobiographical account and reflections on practice, which currently offer valuable tools for research and professional development. The research results highlight how numerous stimuli emerge for the renewal of teaching and learning practices through innovative experiences developed in classrooms and schools. Stress is also given to the need for closer <b>administrative</b> and community <b>cooperation</b> in the implementation of these innovations.

A. T. H. S. The focus of this study was on how the implementers of a school made use of the experience gained in the Experimental Implementation Phase (EIP) in 2005 / 06 to improve the program implementation quality in the Full Implementation Phase (FIP) in 2006 / 07. Results showed that the program implementation in the FIP was generally high and the program was well received by the implementers. Factors that facilitated the implementation of the program were identified, including the adoption of an incremental change strategy, the incorporation of the program into both formal and informal curricula, positive perceptions of the program among staff and agency social workers, sufficient school <b>administrative</b> support, excellent <b>cooperation</b> between the school and the social work agency, presence of a dedicated school contact person and instructors who engaged themselves in continuous quality improvement of the implementation, and an emphasis on application of what had been learned.
