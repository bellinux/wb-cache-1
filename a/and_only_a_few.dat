5|$|British general Kirkpatrick {{arrives at}} a figure of 15,000 young men capable of bearing arms, formed into 30 risalas. They were drafted into the Ahmedy Corps in 1785 {{and went on to}} serve in Tipu's campaigns against the Marathas, the Nizam, and the British during 1786 and 1787. Casualties were heavy <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> survived captivity.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{widespread}} vandalism and violence, only twenty arrests {{were made on}} the day. The strikers intimidated the police, <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> were willing to arrest vandals. Chief Hyland and many officers were sympathetic to the strike, but the local judicial magistrates were not. According to one union report, union members who were arrested faced fines up to $50, while the arrested strikebreakers were immediately acquitted by a local judge.|$|E

5|$|Nearly 100 journalists, bloggers {{and writers}} have been kidnapped or killed in Mexico since 2000, making the country {{one of the}} most {{dangerous}} places on the planet in which to be a journalist.

5|$|The Knights {{proceeded}} to rebuild and strengthen castles {{destroyed by the}} Prussians. A number of Prussians escaped either to Sudovia or to Lithuania, or were resettled by the Knights. Many free peasants were made into serfs. Local nobles had to convert and give hostages, <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> of them were granted privileges to retain their noble status. From 1274 to 1283 the Teutonic Knights conquered Skalvians, Nadruvians, and Sudovians/Yotvingians.|$|E

5|$|This {{alliance}} {{was probably}} a weakly centralized state, with a military organization {{similar to the one}} of the Hellenistic Kingdoms. The exact degree of centralization is a matter of debate, with archaeologists, such as archeologist Kris Lockyear, denying the existence of a state, because the archaeological evidence shows regional diversity <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> region-wide trends. Others, such as historian Alexandru Diaconescu, dispute this and conclude that there was a centralized political structure.|$|E
5|$|All {{but two of}} the {{handcart}} companies {{successfully completed}} the rugged journey, with relatively few problems <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> deaths. However, the fourth and fifth companies, known as the Willie and Martin Companies, respectively, had serious problems. The companies left Iowa City, Iowa, in July 1856, very late to begin the trip across the plains. They met severe winter weather west of present-day Casper, Wyoming, and continued to cope with deep snow and storms {{for the remainder of the}} journey. Food supplies were soon exhausted. Young organized a rescue effort that brought the companies in, but more than 210 of the 980 emigrants in the two parties died.|$|E
5|$|All {{species of}} cone snails are venomous and can sting painfully when handled, {{although}} many species {{are too small}} to pose much of a risk to humans, <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> fatalities have been reliably reported. Their venom is a complex mixture of toxins, some fast-acting and others slower but deadlier. The effects of individual cone-shell toxins on victims' nervous systems are so precise as to be useful tools for research in neurology, and the small size of their molecules makes it easy to synthesize them.|$|E

5|$|Ants {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> large islands, such as Greenland, Iceland, parts of Polynesia and the Hawaiian Islands lack native ant species. Ants occupy {{a wide range}} of {{ecological}} niches and exploit many different food resources as direct or indirect herbivores, predators and scavengers. Most ant species are omnivorous generalists, but a few are specialist feeders. Their ecological dominance is demonstrated by their biomass: ants are estimated to contribute 15–20% (on average and nearly 25% in the tropics) of terrestrial animal biomass, exceeding that of the vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Asad {{divided the}} spoils among his men, sending the captive Turgesh {{women to the}} local Iranian dehgans. He {{remained}} {{at the site of}} his victory for five days, before returning to Balkh, nine days after his departure. From there he set out for Jazza, where the khagan had fled. Suluk fled before the Arab pursuit, but the Arabs were soon beset by heavy rain and snow, allowing the khagan and Ibn Surayj to escape to Upper Tokharistan, whence they moved on to Usrushana. The Turgesh raiding parties left behind in Khurasan were captured or destroyed one by one by Asad and his officers, <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> Sogdians managed to escape back across the Oxus.|$|E
5|$|During the Industrial Revolution the Welsh woollen {{industry}} {{was slow to}} mechanize compared to the mills of northern England. When railways reached mid Wales in the 1860s they brought a flood of cheap mass-produced products that destroyed the local industry. However, development of the South Wales Coalfield opened a growing market for woollen products from water-powered mills in the south west, which prospered until after World War I. At one time {{there were more than}} 300 working wool mills. The industry went into steady decline after World War I, <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> mills continue to operate.|$|E

5|$|Early Dutch missionaries faced strong {{opposition}} among Torajans, {{especially among the}} elite, because the abolition of their profitable slave trade had angered them. Some Torajans were forcibly relocated to the lowlands by the Dutch, {{where they could be}} more easily controlled. Taxes were kept high, undermining the wealth of the elites. Ultimately, the Dutch influence did not subdue Torajan culture, <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> Torajans were converted. In 1950, only 10% of the population had converted to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 {{the kibbutz}} decided after four gatherings {{to appoint a}} team of members to discuss the {{privatization}} of electricity, food, mail, barbershop and cosmetics. Other services were to be kept under {{the responsibility of the}} kibbutz, these include: healthcare, education and welfare. The dispute mainly concerned the privatization of the dining room. At the end of the discussions, most privatization initiatives were rejected, <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minor changes that had no practical effect on the collective lifestyle were accepted.|$|E
5|$|Located on the Atlantic {{coast of}} the Sahara Desert, it lies {{on the west coast}} of Africa. With the {{exception}} of Friendship Port and a small fishing port, the coastal strip is mostly left empty and allowed to flood. The coastline includes shifting sandbanks and sandy beaches. There are areas of quicksand close to the harbour. Nouakchott is largely flat <b>and</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> meters above sea level. It is threatened by the sand dunes advancing from its eastern side which pose a daily problem. There have been efforts to save particular areas, including work by Jean Meunier. Owing to the rapid build-up, the city is quite spread out, with few tall buildings. Most buildings are one-story.|$|E
