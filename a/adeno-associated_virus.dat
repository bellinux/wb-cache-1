5|$|Gene therapy {{typically}} {{involves the}} use of a non-infectious virus (i.e., a viral vector such as the <b>adeno-associated</b> <b>virus)</b> to shuttle genetic material into a part of the brain. The gene used leads to the production of an enzyme that helps to manage PD symptoms or protects the brain from further damage. In 2010 there were four clinical trials using gene therapy in PD. There have not been important adverse effects in these trials although the clinical usefulness of gene therapy is still unknown. One of these reported positive results in 2011, but the company filed for bankruptcy in March 2012.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, three {{independent}} research groups reported {{that patients with}} the rare genetic retinal disease Leber's congenital amaurosis had been successfully treated using gene therapy with <b>adeno-associated</b> <b>virus</b> (AAV).|$|E
25|$|A 2012 study {{reported}} that introducing the TERT gene into healthy one-year-old mice using an engineered <b>adeno-associated</b> <b>virus</b> led to a 24% increase in lifespan, without any increase in cancer.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} viral vectors {{can be used}} to obtain shRNA {{expression}} in cells including <b>adeno-associated</b> <b>viruses</b> (AAVs), adenoviruses, and lentiviruses. With <b>adeno-associated</b> <b>viruses</b> and adenoviruses, the genomes remain episomal. This is advantageous as insertional mutagenesis is avoided. It is disadvantageous in that the progeny of the cell will lose the virus quickly through cell division unless the cell divides very slowly. AAVs differ from adenoviruses in that the viral genes have been removed and they have diminished packing capacity. Lentiviruses integrate into sections of transcriptionally active chromatin and are thus passed on to progeny cells. With this approach there is increased risk of insertional mutagenesis; however, the risk can be reduced by using an integrase-deficient lentivirus.|$|R
30|$|Despite {{the great}} {{potential}} CRISPR/Cas 9 plasmids offer, there are limitations that make delivering molecular loads to target cells challenging for widespread application. Commonly used viruses, such as adenoviruses, <b>adeno-associated</b> <b>viruses,</b> and lentiviruses, {{are known for}} having high transfection rates (Deyle and Russell 2009; Matrai et al. 2010). However, adenoviruses cause excessive immune reactions (Ritter et al. 2002), <b>adeno-associated</b> <b>viruses</b> can cause insertional mutagenesis (Deyle and Russell 2009), and lentiviruses can cause both immune reactions and insertional mutagenesis (Follenzi et al. 2007; Hacein-Bey-Abina et al. 2003; Matrai et al. 2010; VandenDriessche et al. 2002). While CRISPR-Cas 9 provides an elegant method to by-pass many of the concerns related to insertional mutagenesis (Zhou et al. 2014), viruses are still constrained by payload capacity (Gardlik et al. 2005), which could limit utility.|$|R
40|$|Eleven avian {{adenovirus}} strains {{were tested}} {{for the presence of}} avian <b>adeno-associated</b> <b>viruses</b> (AAAV). Six strains contained AAAV.

25|$|German {{scientists}} {{have reported that}} a virus called <b>Adeno-associated</b> <b>virus</b> might {{have a role in}} male infertility, though it is otherwise not harmful. Other diseases such as chlamydia, and gonorrhea can also cause infertility, due to internal scarring (fallopian tube obstruction).|$|E
25|$|The <b>adeno-associated</b> <b>virus</b> (AAV), {{previously}} {{thought to be}} a contaminant in adenovirus preparations, was first identified as a dependovirus in the 1960s in the laboratories of Bob Atchison at Pittsburgh and Wallace Rowe at NIH. Serological studies in humans subsequently indicated that, despite being present in people infected by helper viruses such as adenovirus or herpes virus, AAV itself did not cause any disease.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{because of}} its {{potential}} use as a gene therapy vector, researchers have created an altered AAV called self-complementary <b>adeno-associated</b> <b>virus</b> (scAAV). Whereas AAV packages a single strand of DNA and requires the process of second-strand synthesis, scAAV packages both strands which anneal together to form double stranded DNA. By skipping second strand synthesis scAAV allows for rapid expression in the cell. Otherwise, scAAV carries many characteristics of its AAV counterpart.|$|E
40|$|An 18 - to 20 -nm virus {{particle}} was {{isolated from the}} Olson strain of quail bronchitis, an avian adenovirus. On density gradient separation the small virions were primarily found at densities of 1. 39 and 1. 42 g/cm 3. The majority of the infectious particles were at the heavier density. The virus had a hexagonal outline and contained single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid. It was resistant to heating at 56 C {{for more than an}} hour and was not inactivated by treatment with chloroform or low pH. Purified virus did not agglutinate erythrocytes of various avian and mammalian species. Replication of the small particles occurred either in chicken embryos or in cultures of embryo kidney cells coinfected with an adenovirus helper. Antigenically the virus was distinct from the <b>adeno-associated</b> <b>viruses</b> types 1, 2, 3, and 4. The virus is the avian equivalent of the <b>adeno-associated</b> <b>viruses</b> of primates and lower animals...|$|R

30|$|Traditionally, viruses {{have been}} the {{benchmark}} for which transfection efficiency is measured. However, they fall short of meeting critical design requirements for robust transfection, particularly in preparation for clinical application. Adenoviruses, <b>Adeno-associated</b> <b>viruses,</b> and lentiviruses are all considered to have high transfection rates {{in a wide range}} of cell types (Gardlik et al. 2005; Silman and Fooks 2000). Unfortunately, adenoviruses are immunologically inflammatory which can be life-threatening (Bessis et al. 2004; Ritter et al. 2002), <b>adeno-associated</b> <b>viruses</b> can cause insertional mutagenesis which can be cytotoxic (Deyle and Russell 2009; Monahan and Samulski 2000), and lentiviruses cause immunologic responses and insertional mutagenesis (Follenzi et al. 2007; Hacein-Bey-Abina et al. 2003, 2008; Matrai et al. 2010; VandenDriessche et al. 2002). While retroviruses are useful in CNS (central nervous system) targets (Gardlik et al. 2005; Verma and Somia 1997), the risk of insertional mutagenesis is quite high (Gardlik et al. 2005). Furthermore, viruses in general are limited in their effectiveness because of the limited pay load capacity (≤ 10  kbp) (Gardlik et al. 2005).|$|R
25|$|Gene {{knockdown}} of FOXP2 in Area X of the {{basal ganglia}} in songbirds results in incomplete and inaccurate song imitation. Overexpression of FoxP2 was accomplished through injection of <b>adeno-associated</b> <b>virus</b> serotype 1 (AAV1) into Area X of the brain. This overexpression produced similar effects {{to that of}} knockdown; juvenile zebra finch birds were unable to accurately imitate their tutors. Similarly, in adult canaries higher FOXP2 levels also correlate with song changes.|$|E
25|$|Leber's {{congenital}} amaurosis is {{an inherited}} blinding disease caused by mutations in the RPE65 gene. The {{results of a}} small clinical trial in children were published in April. Delivery of recombinant <b>adeno-associated</b> <b>virus</b> (AAV) carrying RPE65 yielded positive results. In May two more groups reported positive results in independent clinical trials using gene therapy to treat the condition. In all three clinical trials, patients recovered functional vision without apparent side-effects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adeno-associated</b> <b>virus</b> (AAV) {{is a small}} {{virus that}} infects humans and some other primate species. AAV is not {{currently}} known to cause disease, and causes a very mild immune response. AAV can infect both dividing and non-dividing cells and may incorporate its genome into that of the host cell. Moreover, AAV mostly stays as episomal (replicating without incorporation into the chromosome); performing long and stable expression. These features make AAV a very attractive candidate for creating viral vectors for gene therapy. However, AAV can only bring up to 5kb which is considerably small compared to AAV's original capacity.|$|E

At the age of 21 he attended the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine where he received the Oliver prize for ophthalmological research. His earlier research in gene transfer to the retina using <b>adeno-associated</b> <b>viruses</b> was one of the first. This work was conducted under the Howard Hughes Medical Student Fellowship.|$|R
40|$|Gene {{therapy for}} heart failure {{patients}} {{is still in}} an experimental stage. However, it is a promising tool to provide detailed understanding of the patho-bio-chemical processes involved in failing heart muscle cells. Current literature and experimental pre-clinical studies highlight the potential role of gene therapy in cardiac insufficiency. Transvascular application and intramyocardial injection are possible clinical applications for viral vectors. At present, the most sophisticated vectors are <b>adeno-associated</b> <b>viruses</b> which allow an effective gene transfer with minimum immunogenicity...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that enhancement of the activity of heme oxygenase can interfere with processes of fibrogenesis associated with recurrent liver injury, we investigated the therapeutic potential of over-expression of heme oxygense- 1 in a CCI 4 -induced micronodular cirrhosis model. Methods: Recombinant <b>adeno-associated</b> <b>viruses</b> carrying rat HO- 1 or GFP gene were generated. 1 × 10 12 vg of <b>adeno-associated</b> <b>viruses</b> were administered through portal injection {{at the time of}} the induction of liver fibrosis. Results: Conditioning the rat liver with over-expression of HO- 1 by rAAV/HO- 1 significantly increased the HO enzymatic activities in a stable manner. The development of micronodular cirrhosis was significantly inhibited in rAAV/HO- 1 -transduced animals as compared to controls. Portal hypertension was markedly diminished in rAAV/ HO- 1 -transduced animals as compared to controls, whereas there are no significant changes in systolic blood pressure. This finding was accompanied with improved liver biochemistry, less infiltrating macrophages and less activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in rAAV/ HO- 1 -transduced livers. Conclusions: Enhancement of HO activity in the livers suppresses the development of cirrhosis. © 2006 The WJG Press. All rights reserved. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
25|$|Because of AAV's {{specialized}} {{gene therapy}} advantages, researchers {{have created an}} altered version of AAV termed self-complementary <b>adeno-associated</b> <b>virus</b> (scAAV). Whereas AAV packages a single strand of DNA and must wait for its second strand to be synthesized, scAAV packages two shorter strands that are complementary to each other. By avoiding second-strand synthesis, scAAV can express more quickly, although as a caveat, scAAV can only encode half of the already limited capacity of AAV. Recent reports suggest that scAAV vectors are more immunogenic than single stranded adenovirus vectors, inducing a stronger activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adeno-associated</b> <b>virus</b> (AAV) {{is a small}} virus which infects {{humans and}} some other primate species. AAV is not {{currently}} known to cause disease. The virus causes a very mild immune response, lending further support to its apparent lack of pathogenicity. Gene therapy vectors using AAV can infect both dividing and quiescent cells and persist in an extrachromosomal state without integrating into the genome of the host cell, although in the native virus some integration of virally carried genes into the host genome does occur. These features make AAV a very attractive candidate for creating viral vectors for gene therapy, and {{for the creation of}} isogenic human disease models. Recent human clinical trials using AAV for gene therapy in the retina have shown promise.|$|E
25|$|The gene {{silencing}} effects of transfected designed siRNA are generally transient, but this difficulty {{can be overcome}} through an RNAi approach. Delivering this siRNA from DNA templates can be done through several recombinant viral vectors based on retrovirus, <b>adeno-associated</b> <b>virus,</b> adenovirus, and lentivirus. The latter is the most efficient virus that stably delivers siRNA to target cells as it can transduce nondividing cells as well as directly target the nucleus. These specific viral vectors have been synthesized to effectively facilitate siRNA that is not viable for transfection into cells. Another aspect is {{that in some cases}} synthetic viral vectors can integrate shRNA into the cell genome which allows for stable expression of siRNA and long-term gene knockdown. This technique is advantageous because it is in vivo and effective for difficult to transfect cell. However problems arise because it can trigger antiviral responses in some cell types leading to mutagenic and immunogenic effects.|$|E
40|$|In {{the late}} 1970 s, it was {{predicted}} that gene therapy would be applied to humans within a decade. However, despite some success, gene therapy has still not become a routine practise in medicine. In this review, we will examine the problems, both experimental and clinical, {{associated with the use of}} viral material for transgenic insertion.

Mg 2 +ions also interfered with the adsorption of plasmid DNA to nylon and nitrocellulose membranes.

2500|$|The {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} the <b>adeno-associated</b> <b>virus</b> is a deficiency in replication and thus its inability to multiply in unaffected cells. [...] The first factor that was described as providing successful generation of new AAV particles, was the adenovirus, from which the AAV name originated. It was then shown that AAV replication can be facilitated by selected proteins derived from the adenovirus genome, by other viruses such as HSV, or by genotoxic agents, such as UV irradiation or hydroxyurea.|$|E
40|$|<b>Adeno-associated</b> <b>viruses</b> (AAVs) {{depend on}} a helper virus for {{efficient}} replication. To identify novel AAV isolates, we screened a diverse set of virus isolates {{for the presence of}} AAV DNA. AAVs found in 10 simian adenovirus isolates showed greater than 96 % homology to AAV 1 and AAV 6 but had distinct biological properties. Two representatives of this group, AAV(VR- 195) and AAV(VR- 355), were studied in more detail. While the novel AAVs had high sequence homologies and required sialic acid for cell binding and transduction, differences were observed in lectin competition, resulting in distinct tropisms in human cancer cell lines...|$|R

2500|$|Scientists can use viral or non-viral {{systems for}} {{delivery}} of the Cas9 and sgRNA into target cells.

The group was then able to sort the cells, using cell surface markers, to help identify successfully edited cells. Deep sequencing of a target site confirmed that knock-in genome modifications had occurred with up to ∼20% efficiency, which accounted for up to approximately one-third of total editing events. However, hard-to-transfect cells (stem cells, neurons, hematopoietic cells, etc.) require more efficient delivery systems such as those based on lentivirus (LVs), adenovirus (AdV) and <b>adeno-associated</b> <b>virus</b> (AAV).|$|E

50|$|Because {{of their}} tissue {{selectivity}} and persistent expression recombinant <b>adeno-associated</b> <b>viruses</b> (AAV) have therapeutic {{potential in the}} treatment of inherited cardiomyopathy resulting from MYBPC3 mutations- Several targeting approaches have been developed. The most recent is genome editing to correct a mutation by CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Naturally existing as part of the prokaryotic immune system, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been used for correction of mutations in the mammalian genome. By inducing nicks in the double-stranded DNA and providing a template DNA sequence, it is possible to repair mutations by homologous recombination. This approach has not yet been evaluated for MYBPC3 mutations, but it could be used for each single or clustered mutation, and therefore applied preferentially for frequent founder MYBPC3 mutations.|$|R
