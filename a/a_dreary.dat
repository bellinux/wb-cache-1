5|$|The {{death of}} Chekhov's brother Nikolay from {{tuberculosis}} in 1889 influenced <b>A</b> <b>Dreary</b> Story, finished that September, {{about a man}} who confronts the end of a life that he realises has been without purpose. Mikhail Chekhov, who recorded his brother's depression and restlessness after Nikolay's death, was researching prisons at the time as part of his law studies, and Anton Chekhov, in a search for purpose in his own life, himself soon became obsessed with the issue of prison reform.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{designed}} to have a future-retro look, with heavy use of grey tones to give <b>a</b> <b>dreary,</b> stagnant feel to totalitarian London. The largest set created for the film was the Shadow Gallery, which was made {{to feel like a}} cross between a crypt and an undercroft. The Gallery is V's home as well as the place where he stores various artefacts forbidden by the government. Some of the works of art displayed in the gallery include The Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck, Bacchus and Ariadne by Titian, a Mildred Pierce poster, St. Sebastian by Andrea Mantegna, The Lady of Shalott by John William Waterhouse and statues by Giacometti.|$|E
5|$|Continuing north, {{they soon}} {{run out of}} gas, but receive help from the Aurora Boreanaz, who instructs them to stay at a nearby cabin. The two survive {{the night in the}} cabin and set out on foot the next morning. They finally make it to Santa's workshop, only to find a dark, gloomy factory in <b>a</b> <b>dreary,</b> polluted, lifeless wasteland; Santa a sickly and {{depressed}} old man, the elves all horribly mutated and inbred due to Santa's attempts {{to keep up with the}} increasing gift demands year after year, and the reindeer carnivorous, feral monsters that eat the elves who wander out into the snow to die of exhaustion. Santa suddenly collapses and is too sick to deliver the presents. Brian and Stewie agree to do it, but end up wasting an hour and a half at their first house after the family discover their presence, before discovering they were in the wrong house. Realizing that they will not be able to complete the delivery in time, and understanding firsthand the impossibility of Santa's job, Stewie and Brian abandon the delivery in lieu of another plan.|$|E

25|$|During the {{previous}} day at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, Italy's World Cup hopes seemed to be diminishing fast as goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca was sent off with the game still at 0–0. Yet despite this, Italy {{was still able to}} salvage an important 1–0 victory. Norway would ultimately pay a price for their inability to take advantage of Pagliuca's dismissal. With the four teams level on points, the final two group games would each have to finish as draws for things to stay that way. Republic of Ireland made it through after <b>a</b> <b>dreary</b> 0–0 draw with Norway; midfielders Massaro and Bernal traded strikes as Italy and Mexico played to a 1–1 draw.|$|E
25|$|United {{failed to}} build on the {{momentum}} of the Kansas City win, suffering a crushing 0-2 home loss to Seattle, on late goals by rookie Jordan Morris and Joevin Jones. The entire MLS went on break for the Copa América Centenario. Birnbaum and Saborio were called up to their respective national team squads for the USA and Costa Rica. During the league break, the team made an unusual move, adding 16-year old youth national team captain Chris Durkin as a Homegrown Player signing. Durkin was one of the youngest signings in league history, but the unusual deal did not add Durkin to D.C. United's MLS roster. Instead, he was available to play in a U.S. Open Cup match the next day, and would go out on loan after the match, first to Richmond Kickers, and then to resume his residency with the national team program in Bradenton as least until the USA U-17s finished their run at the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup. Durkin did make his debut in the USOC match and by all accounts looked very much as if he belonged. However, the team was unable to break through against the Ft. Lauderdale Strikers defense, and the D.C. squad made a quick exit from the competition, after losing to the Strikers in a penalty kick shootout. When MLS league action resumed, United claimed 4 points in their final 2 matches of the month, including <b>a</b> <b>dreary</b> 0-0 draw in Houston that produced no excitement until stoppage time, when Bill Hamid was forced into two spectacular reaction saves. D.C. United turned in a stronger performance with some home cooking against the New England Revolution, as Neagle and Franklin turned in highlight reel goals, and the home team cruised to a 2-0 win.|$|E
500|$|Next, {{visitors}} were beckoned into {{a cluster of}} cubes containing {{a model of a}} [...] "city of the future" [...] (which a few landmarks clearly indicated as Seattle) and its suburban and rural surroundings, seen first by day and later by night. The next cluster of cubes zoomed in on a vision of a high-tech, future home in a sylvan setting (and a commuter gyrocopter); a series of projections contrasted this [...] "best of the future" [...] to [...] "the worst of the present" [...] (over-uniform suburbs, <b>a</b> <b>dreary</b> urban housing project).|$|E

500|$|Rothbard {{supported}} {{the presidential campaign}} of Pat Buchanan in 1992, and wrote that [...] "with Pat Buchanan as our leader, we shall break the clock of social democracy."

500|$|... "The Raven" [...] follows {{an unnamed}} narrator on <b>a</b> <b>dreary</b> night in December who sits reading [...] "forgotten lore" [...] by a dying fire [...] {{as a way}} to forget the death of his beloved Lenore. A [...] "tapping at [...] chamber door" [...] reveals nothing, but excites his soul to [...] "burning". The tapping is repeated, {{slightly}} louder, and he realizes it is coming from his window. When he goes to investigate, a raven flutters into his chamber. Paying no attention to the man, the raven perches on a bust of Pallas above the door.|$|E

500|$|The year 1904 saw {{the passage}} of the Shop Hours Act, which made some {{provision}} for limiting shop opening hours. In 1907 the first steps were taken to end the Victorian [...] "living-in" [...] practice, which at the time still affected two-thirds of Britain's 750,000 shopworkers. Initially, living-out privileges were only given to male employees; Bondfield campaigned for equivalent rights for women shop workers, arguing that if they were to become [...] "useful, healthy... wives and mothers", they needed to live [...] "rational lives". As part of her campaign, Bondfield advised the playwright Cicely Hamilton, whose shop-based drama Diana of Dobsons appeared that year. Bondfield described the opening scene, set in <b>a</b> <b>dreary,</b> comfortless women's dormitory over a shop, as very like the real thing.|$|E
500|$|... "Road to the North Pole" [...] is {{the seventh}} {{episode of the}} ninth season of the {{animated}} comedy series Family Guy. Directed by Greg Colton and co-written by Chris Sheridan and Danny Smith, the episode originally aired on Fox in the United States on December12,2010. In [...] "Road to the North Pole", two of the show's main characters, Stewie and Brian, both voiced by series creator Seth MacFarlane, go on an adventure to the North Pole because Stewie wants to kill Santa Claus. They eventually discover <b>a</b> <b>dreary,</b> polluting factory full of disease-ridden elves and carnivorous, feral reindeer, along with a sickly, exhausted and suicidal Santa. Stewie and Brian take pity on him, however, and decide to fulfill Christmas by delivering gifts to the entire globe, albeit unsuccessfully.|$|E
500|$|... "Hate That I Love You" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Taila Kraines from BBC Music {{called it a}} gorgeously simple modern duet. A reviewer from The New York Times called the duet breezy. Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters was unconvinced that [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] is a full-fledged ballad, but praised its catchy and smooth composition. Critics compared [...] "Hate That I Love You"'s composition to Beyoncé Knowles' [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] (B'Day, 2006). Jackie Hayden from Hot Press called [...] "Hate that I Love You" [...] "the prettier twin of 'Irreplaceable'". [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine criticized the song, and called it a lazy carbon copy of [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] and [...] "So Sick" [...] (In My Own Words, 2006). Sarah McIntyre of RTÉ.ie concluded that the single [...] "brings mournful acoustic guitar strumming, embarrassing harmonising and trite lyrics to <b>a</b> <b>dreary</b> whole." ...|$|E
