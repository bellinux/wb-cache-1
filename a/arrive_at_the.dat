5|$|American kestrels in Canada and the {{northern}} United States typically migrate south in the winter, sometimes going as far as Central America and the Caribbean.

Females are found in open areas more often than males during the non-breeding season. A common explanation for this behavior is that the larger females <b>arrive</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> preferred habitat first and exclude males from their territory.|$|E
