25|$|Corporal Jason Stuart Barnes aged 25 years, {{from the}} Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, {{attached}} to 2nd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, {{was killed in}} Afghanistan, Tuesday 22 July 2008. The incident occurred at 1818 hrs local time. Corporal Barnes was driving a Vector <b>ambulance</b> <b>vehicle</b> when it hit a suspected Improvised Explosive Device. He was returning to base after he had successfully aided in the helicopter evacuation of a casualty who had been injured earlier near Kajaki in northern Helmand.|$|E
25|$|The {{flexible}} {{design of the}} vehicle, its high speed, maneuverability and long range, on road and off-road, {{makes it possible to}} produce various versions to satisfy various military and security purposes. Variants include the Fahd 240/280 APC, Fahd 280-30 IFV, a command post vehicle, <b>ambulance</b> <b>vehicle,</b> light armored recovery vehicle, and can be used for anti-riot purposes, mine laying and mine dispensing purposes, making it possible to form independent units capable of dealing with different threats of armor, low-flying targets, and personnel, with common repair duties, and operation. The Fahd consists of a Mercedes-Benz LAP 1117/32 truck (4 × 4) chassis fitted with an armored body. It has a usual APC configuration of placing the driver and the commander on the front, and a large box-like shape, similar to the German Fuchs.|$|E
2500|$|The {{system of}} {{ferrying}} injured from any location within the stadium to the CRP required a formal declaration {{to be made}} by those in charge for it to take effect. As this declaration was not immediately performed, confusion reigned over those attempting to administer aid on the pitch. This confusion migrated to the first responders waiting in ambulances at the CRP, a location which quickly deteriorated into an ambulance parking lot. Some crews were hesitant to leave their vehicles, unsure of whether patients were coming to them, or vice versa. Others who did leave their vehicles were then faced with the obstacles inherent in placing distance between oneself and one's equipment. As the Panel explained in their report: [...] "The equipment was no use on the <b>ambulance</b> <b>vehicle</b> when critical early resuscitation was taking place some distance away on the pitch, behind the Leppings Lane end and in the gymnasium. Some ambulance crew did take equipment when they left their vehicle, but there was no systematic direction to do so, not all did, and none initially had been given any information about the situation inside the stadium." [...] A total of 42 ambulances arrived at the stadium. Out of this number, two managed of their own accord to make their way onto the pitch — while a third ambulance made its way onto the pitch at the direction of DCAO Hopkins, who felt its visibility might allay crowd concerns. The remaining 39 ambulances were collectively able to transport approximately 149 people to either Northern General Hospital, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, or Barnsley Hospital for treatment.|$|E

40|$|This {{work is a}} {{preliminary}} study {{on behalf of the}} Bavarian Red Cross (BRK) and examines if and what effect on traffic safety can be measured when BRK <b>ambulance</b> <b>vehicles</b> are equipped with additional beacons on the front fender next to the front lights. Several studies document the high crash risk particular during emergency drives. The BRK endeavors to decrease the crash frequency of their <b>ambulance</b> <b>vehicles</b> by improving their visibility especially at intersections and narrow gateways. Therefore, the additional beacons need to be evaluated, which is the purpose of this study. In order to evaluate the effect of additional beacons, emergency drives conducted with equipped and unequipped <b>ambulance</b> <b>vehicles</b> were compared. More precisely, the exit of a BRK station and the surrounding road segment was observed for 14 days by a video camera, which enables computer-vision aided analysis of the traffic. Within this time frame, 38 traffic situations of unequipped and 13 situations of equipped <b>ambulance</b> <b>vehicles</b> could be observed. The trajectories of interacting road users in these situations were ana lyzed. The use of Surrogate Safety measures appeared to be not practicable to obtain statistica l significant results due to few interacting trajectories and no critical situations. Instead in dicators like maximum deceleration, position and time of braking and reaching walking speed etc. of single trajectories were used. The indicators showed, that road users entered the observation area slower encountering equipped ambulance vehicles—probably due to prior braking—than was measured at emergency drives without additional beacons. Furthermore, road users on average braked 3. 5 m earlier, less intensely and reached walking speed 4 m earlier when <b>ambulance</b> <b>vehicles</b> were equipped with additional beacons. A follow-up study will examine video material of longer time frames and different locations to enlarge the samples size and thus to gain more significant results. Particular attention will be paid to urban intersections, which are the most critical spots for <b>ambulance</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Moreover, the use of Surrogate Safety Measures will be examined...|$|R
