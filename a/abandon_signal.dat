50|$|In April 1989, Inmos {{was sold}} to SGS-Thomson (now STMicroelectronics). Around the same time, work was started on an {{enhanced}} transputer, the T9000. This encountered various technical problems and delays, and was eventually <b>abandoned,</b> <b>signalling</b> {{the end of the}} development of the transputer as a parallel processing platform. However, transputer derivatives such as the ST20 were later incorporated into chipsets for embedded applications such as set-top boxes.|$|R
50|$|Up to 5 November 2007, the {{dispatcher}} at Geilenkirchen signal box Gf controlled three crossings, turnouts and the signals in the station. On 5 November 2007, this task {{was taken over}} by the Grevenbroich electronic signalling centre at the completion of its second phase of construction. After numerous acts of vandalism at the <b>abandoned</b> <b>signal</b> boxes between Rheydt and Ubach-Palenberg, the doors to all signal boxes on the section, including Geilenkirchen, were replaced with security doors and the boxes’ windows were secured with perforated plates in November 2009.|$|R
5000|$|Amid {{failure of}} neopositivism's {{fundamental}} tenets, Hempel in 1965 <b>abandoned</b> verificationism, <b>signaling</b> neopositivism's demise. [...] From 1930 onward, Karl Popper had refuted any positivism by asserting falsificationism, which Popper claimed had killed positivism, although, paradoxically, Popper was commonly {{mistaken for a}} positivist. [...] Even Popper's 1934 book embraces DN model, widely accepted as the model of scientific explanation {{for as long as}} physics remained the model of science examined by philosophers of science.|$|R
50|$|Except for a {{short time}} in the 1930s, Dunton had no {{telephone}} service, and a line that had been run from Rico over the mountain proved impossible to maintain in winter. To the chagrin of the women and the pleasure of the men, the phone line was <b>abandoned.</b> Radio <b>signals</b> were virtually impossible to catch in the narrow valley, and television was never viewed at Dunton until the most recent incarnation of owners took over in the mid 1990s.|$|R
50|$|In the {{geographical}} location, the west exit {{of the central}} tunnel is Pingtung County Shizi Township, where Central Signal Station, Two thousandths of the slope slowly rising, the tunnel completely through the straight line through the tea where the mountain, when rising to the highest point of the whole line (175 meters above sea level), and then slowly to eight thousandths of the slope to the east mouth down, arrived at the East It {{is already in the}} Taitung County Daren Township, not far from the tunnel after leaving the <b>abandoned</b> Pu'an <b>Signal</b> Station.|$|R
50|$|It was {{not until}} 1927 that the two signal boxes W1 and B2 were built {{to take control of}} the {{standard}} gauge section north of the station building. Around 1930, here was a facility for turning locomtives to the east of the station’s workshops. The turntable had three rails and could be used to turn narrow-gauge locomotives.The standard-gauge tracks were electrified on 25 September 1966. When the two narrow-gauge lines were closed in 1972, the narrow-gauge tracks were removed at Klingenberg-Colmnitz station, but the standard-gauge tracks remained essentially the same. Instead of the possibility of transferring it to a narrow-gauge line, one crane was transferred to a steel construction company and the other was dismantled. The remaining buildings from the narrow-gauge railways were a loading hall and the stand for a transfer crane. The four tracks in the narrow-gauge area were used for dispatching wagons. In 2000, the station was connected to an electronic interlocking. This was the occasion for thoroughly modernising the station to meet modern requirements. The station forecourt was converted into a combined bus station and car park. Since then, the station has been operated with three through tracks; two tracks are adjacent to the entrance building, including one with an outside platform, and there is also a northern overtaking track. An underpass with a lift (which is a little small) was built between the two outside platforms. The connection to track 7 is still preserved, as is the standard-gauge track on the former narrow-gauge side of the station. It is no longer usable. In 2009, the freight shed was demolished. The <b>abandoned</b> <b>signal</b> boxes have now been demolished. A functional relic from the narrow-gauge era is the coal shed, which can still be seen in photos in 2011.|$|R
50|$|During the turbulent, riot-torn 1960s, {{in one of}} {{the most}} racially {{polarized}} cities in the country, this area witnessed the creation and rise of an urban paradise, imagined, engineered, owned and operated by a young African-American entrepreneur, Winston E. Willis. Shortly after the infamous Glenville Shootout and subsequent widespread riots, white business owners began leaving the area in record numbers. Stunned and shaken by the eruption of racial violence, boarded-up storefronts and <b>abandoned</b> buildings <b>signaled</b> the mass exodus toward the safety of more ethnically controlled neighborhoods. Having been under the notion that the election of a black mayor, Carl B. Stokes, would be their insurance against such violent uprisings, and fearing an all-out race war, previously successful white business owners left the inner city in droves and never looked back.|$|R
50|$|At 09:00 Bartlett was {{informed}} {{that the rate of}} flooding had increased due to the ship's forward motion and that the flooding had reached D-deck. Realising that there was now no hope of reaching land in time, Bartlett gave the final order to stop the engines and sounded two final long blasts of the whistle. As water had already reached the bridge, he and Assistant Commander Dyke walked off onto the deck and entered the water, swimming to a collapsible boat from which they continued to coordinate the rescue operations. The whistle blows were the final <b>abandon</b> ship <b>signal</b> for the ship's engineers (commanded by Chief Engineer Robert Fleming), formally releasing them from their duty. Like their colleagues on Titanic, they had remained at their posts until the last possible moment. They escaped via the staircase into funnel #4, which ventilated the engine room, before jumping overboard and swimming clear.|$|R
50|$|Until March 2007, WALA {{carried a}} {{simulcast}} of WBPG (now a CW affiliate) {{on a second}} digital subchannel as that station {{did not have a}} digital signal of its own. WBPG eventually launched a low-power digital signal in late 2008 and boosted to full power in 2009, when WXXV-TV in neighboring Biloxi, Mississippi <b>abandoned</b> its analog <b>signal</b> on UHF channel 25, which shared the digital frequency that WBPG was assigned. On May 18, 2007, LIN TV announced that it was exploring strategic alternatives that would have resulted in the sale of the company.|$|R
50|$|The halt of Jägersfreude {{is located}} in the centre of the Saarbrücker {{district}} of Jägersfreude. Until the end of the millennium, Jägerfreude was also a railway junction, which was controlled from the signal box in Saarbrücken Hbf. The freight trains between Dudweiler and Saarbrücken could use three railway tracks, because the parallel (single-track) freight bypass line bypassed it to reach the Saarbrücken marshalling yard. Today, the four sets of points and block signals, which controlled the junction have been dismantled. At the same time, the first sets of points are {{at the level of the}} platform at the Saarbrücken marshalling yard. The junction was <b>abandoned</b> as the <b>signal</b> box of Saarbrücken Hbf was converted and control transferred to Karlsruhe.|$|R
60|$|When {{the troops}} which {{remained}} in the camp found, on the following morning, {{that they had been}} deceived and <b>abandoned,</b> they made <b>signals</b> to the Scythians to come to them, and, when they came, the invalids surrendered themselves and the camp to their possession. The Scythians then, immediately, leaving a proper guard to defend the camp, set out to follow the Persian army. Instead, however, of keeping directly upon their track, they took a shorter course, which would lead them more speedily to the river. The Persians, being unacquainted with the country, got involved in fens and morasses, and other difficulties of the way, and their progress was thus so much impeded that the Scythians reached the river before them.|$|R
500|$|After sailing {{back to the}} United States, Saratoga loaded 1,200 {{passengers}} at Hoboken, New Jersey, on 30 July, a {{hot summer}} day. In preparation for sailing for France the next day, the transport sailed to an anchorage at Tompkinsville, Staten Island. Among the passengers on board were nurses of [...] the Army's Base Hospital No. 8. To escape the sweltering heat aboard the ship, many of the nurses on board returned to their cabins after lunch and removed their heavy wool uniforms. While at anchor at about 13:30, Saratoga was rammed in the port quarter by [...] of the Panama Steamship Company after her engine room misunderstood a command from the bridge. The force of the impact buckled plating from Saratogas rail down to the waterline, leaving a [...] hole. Saratoga began to list almost immediately, and the <b>abandon</b> ship <b>signal</b> was given soon after. The passengers, including nurses {{in various states of}} undress, reported to their assigned lifeboats and evacuated the ship in an orderly fashion. The close proximity to shore, and the large number of smaller craft in the vicinity, allowed all on board to be rescued without loss of life or injury. Panama had only superficial damage; Saratoga raised anchor and was towed near the Morse Dry Dock & Repair Company where she was allowed to settle in the mud. The erstwhile Saratoga passengers were collected from the various rescue craft and were loaded onto , where they sailed for France on 6 August.|$|R
40|$|Footprint {{identification}} is {{the measurement of}} footprint features for recognizing {{the identity of a}} user. Footprint is universal, easy to capture and does not change much across time. Footprint biometric system does not require specialized acquisition devices. Footprint image of a left leg is captured for hundred people in different angles. No special lighting is used in this setup. The foot image is positioned and cropped according to the key points. Sequential modified Haar transform is applied to the resized footprint image to obtain Modified Haar Energy (MHE) feature. The sequential modified Haar wavelet can map integer-valued signals onto integer-valued <b>signals</b> <b>abandoning</b> the property of perfect reconstruction. The MHE feature is compared with the feature vectors stored in database using Euclidean Distance. The accuracy of the MHE feature and Haar energy feature under different decomposition levels and combinations are compared. Above 92. 375 % percent accuracy can be achieved using proposed MHE feature...|$|R
50|$|Masami Saotome joins a group {{date with}} Kusatsu Akiko. Late in the night, he drops a tablet into her drink; when she falls ill, {{he tells the}} others that he will get her home. Taking her to an <b>abandoned</b> building, he <b>signals</b> for Manticore to come; she turns the corpse into her loyal slave. Two months prior, Saotome had found the corpse of Yurihara at school, before himself being {{attacked}} by Manticore. Rather than panic or fight back, he told Manticore {{it would be better}} off leaving him alive and taking the form of Yurihara. In time, the two were deeply in love with each other, as they hatched their plan to conquer the world. As their experiments in controlling people begin to fail, and Kirima Nagi seems to be investigating too close, the relationship between Saotome and Manticore strains, until Naoko Kamikishiro came upon them, calling for Echoes. Manticore kills Kamikishiro, but for Saotome, this was the missing link: he has a plan to solve their problems.|$|R
500|$|Bouvet {{had been}} driven {{offshore}} in his flagship Immortalité during the storm, and when the wind fell during 29 December he decided to <b>abandon</b> the operation. <b>Signalling</b> to the ships within view, he ordered his remaining squadron to sail southeast towards Brest. Some ships failed to receive the message and continued to the second rendezvous off the River Shannon, but they were few and scattered and in the continuing storms no landing was possible. With provisions running low, these ships also turned and sailed for Brest, as the weather worsened once more. As their expeditionary force sailed home, Morard de Galles and Hoche arrived in Bantry Bay on 30 December, discovering that the fleet had gone. With their own provisions almost exhausted, Fraternité and Révolution were forced to return to France as well.

50|$|Killamarsh is {{no longer}} served by {{passenger}} rail transport, but before the Second World War, three railway lines made {{their way through the}} west side of the town, with three stations. These were, Killamarsh West (opened 1841), on the Midland Railway's Old Road route which bypassed Sheffield, Killamarsh Central (opened 1892), on the Great Central Railway's mainline from London to Manchester, and Upperthorpe and Killamarsh (opened 1898), on the LD&ECR's Beighton Branch into Sheffield. Upperthorpe and Killamarsh was the first station to close in 1930 after just 32 years of service, with the line itself closing with the outbreak of war nine years later. Post war, and in 1954 Killamarsh West Closed, with Killamarsh Central remaining open until 1963 when it too was closed, both stations victims of British Railways' vast closure schemes during this period. The track through the former Great Central line was eventually lifted in the early 1980s, and today forms part of the Trans Pennine Trail. The LD&ECR's route remains derelict to this day, complete with <b>abandoned</b> ballast and <b>signalling</b> cables. The Midland's Old Road route remains open to freight traffic, and has been the subject of debate in recent times over the possibility of reopening a station for Killamarsh on the Line.|$|R

5000|$|Later that {{afternoon}} the Steinbrenner {{met with the}} forecast gale as strong winds and large waves buffeted the vessel. Although he secured his ship's deck, Captain Albert Stiglin did not have his crew place tarpaulins on the twelve leaf-type [...] "Telescoping" [...] hatch covers; since these were not watertight, they allowed some water to seep into the cargo holds. Around 8 pm one of the leaves on the number 11 hatch worked loose and allowed water to pour into the hold. Crew members were dispatched to secure the cover but, as the storm intensified, 80 mph winds and large waves worked the leaf loose again. Complicating the issue, doors and vents were being forced open by the storm. Conditions were now too treacherous to send crews out on deck. Pumps were started but the flooding continued. Captain Stiglin {{tried to keep the}} waves from causing more damage but by morning other hatch covers had worked loose and the ship staggered to make headway. After a few more maneuvers it became all too apparent that the ship was doomed. Shortly after 7:00 AM on May 11, 1953, an SOS was broadcast. At 7:35 AM, an <b>abandon</b> ship <b>signal</b> was blown on the whistle and the crew mustered at the forward life raft, and the aft lifeboats. As the ship settled in the water, confusion took hold and several men ended up in the water or were injured. The vessel sank quickly fifteen miles south of Isle Royale Light. Alerted by the SOS, the steamers Wilfred Sykes, Joseph H. Thompson (then the largest ship on the lakes), D.M. Clemson, D.G. Kerr, William E. Corey, and the Canadian ship Hochelaga, conducted a search for survivors. The Joseph H. Thompson found the life raft and 6 men taking refuge in it. The D.M. Clemson, under the command of Captain Arthur M. Everett, found one life boat. In heavy winds and rough seas, Captain Everett carefully maneuvered the Clemson to put the lifeboat in the ship's lee and then had the survivors lifted aboard with ropes. The men were then taken to the Captain's quarters where they were given warm food and dry clothes. The Wilfred Sykes rescued the men of the other life boat.|$|R
5000|$|... {{engineers}} and radio officers. First Radio Officer Arthur H, (Dick) Bird escaped from Milag prison camp {{and made it}} home from Germany via Sweden. He was awarded an [...] "MBE". Third Officer William McVicar and Ship's Surgeon Dr. Adeline Nancy Miller of [...] both received [...] "MBE's", the published citation stating: The ship was sailing alone when she was approached by a raider, which opened fire at long range. She replied with her defensive armament but a shell put her main gun out of action and she suffered heavy structural damage. As her speed was {{less than that of}} the enemy, the Captain gave orders to <b>abandon</b> ship. A <b>signal</b> to this effect was made to the enemy, but the raider continued shelling, and holed many of the lifeboats. He sank the ship by gunfire and made off. During the action the Ship's Doctor, with perfect calm, attended to the wounded and dying. She continued her good work after the company had taken to the lifeboats and, by her efforts, saved many lives. The Third Officer was in charge of a lifeboat certified to hold fifty-eight people but which carried eighty-four. She was put before the wind, since she was otherwise unmanageable and, after a memorable voyage of twenty-two days, during which five Europeans and thirty-nine Indians died, a landfall was made. It was due to the courage, resolution and good seamanship of the Third Officer that the survivors reached safety.|$|R
500|$|At 09:00, Duncan {{made the}} signal to prepare for battle while De Winter {{organised}} his ships into a line of battle to meet the British attack in a solid defensive formation, sailing on the port tack in a northeasterly heading. As they manoeuvred into their assigned stations, the Dutch fleet drew closer to the shore. Duncan intended to follow Lord Howe's manoeuvres at the Glorious First of June three years earlier and bring each ship through the Dutch line between two opponents, but the Dutch formation and proximity to the shore rendered this plan impractical. To compensate, Duncan signalled for his ships to form line and sail southeast on the port tack so {{that they had the}} wind directly behind them. Shortly afterwards, concerned that the Dutch might make the shoreline before he could bring them to battle despite his wry insistence that [...] "I am determined to fight the ships on land if I cannot by sea", Duncan ordered his fleet to turn southwards and advance on the enemy and [...] "bear up and sail large". He fired signal guns to alert his captains and then ordered them to [...] "engage the enemy as arriving up" [...] and for his [...] to attack the Dutch rear. At 11:00, Duncan sought to remedy increasing gaps between his vessels by ordering the faster ships to slow down and wait for their compatriots. He then made an effort to re-establish the line on the starboard tack before realising that the Dutch fleet was still in order awaiting the British attack and continually drawing closer to the dangerous coastline. <b>Abandoning</b> his previous <b>signals,</b> Duncan ordered the entire fleet to turn towards the Dutch and attack directly, each ship to [...] "steer for and engage her opponent". Many of these signals were poorly executed and incorrect, visibility was low and Trollope's squadron was still using obsolete signal codes, so a number of vessels failed to comprehend Duncan's intentions, turning the advancing line into a ragged pattern of scattered vessels clustered into two loose groups. The flurry of orders was so quick and contradictory that at least one captain gave up entirely: the Scottish captain, John Inglis, of HMS Belliqueux threw his signal book to the deck in frustration and shouted [...] "Up wi' the hel'lem and gang into the middle o't." ...|$|R
