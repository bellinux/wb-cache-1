5|$|The {{synthesis}} of aziridines from imines {{is another important}} application of the Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky reaction and provides an alternative to amine transfer from oxaziridines. Though less widely applied, the reaction has a similar substrate scope and functional group tolerance to the carbonyl equivalent. The examples shown below are representative; in the latter, an <b>aziridine</b> forms in situ and is opened via nucleophilic attack to form the corresponding amine.|$|E

25|$|The bond angles in <b>aziridine</b> are {{approximately}} 60°, {{considerably less than}} the normal hydrocarbon bond angle of 109.5°, which results in angle strain as in the comparable cyclopropane and ethylene oxide molecules. A banana bond model explains bonding in such compounds. <b>Aziridine</b> is less basic than acyclic aliphatic amines, with a pKa of 7.9 for the conjugate acid, due to increased s character of the nitrogen free electron pair. Angle strain in <b>aziridine</b> also increases the barrier to nitrogen inversion. This barrier height permits the isolation of separate invertomers, for example the cis and trans invertomers of N-chloro-2-methylaziridine.|$|E

40|$|The {{scope of}} dimerization and {{isomerization}} reactions of alpha-lithiated terminal <b>aziridines</b> is detailed. Regio- and stereoselective deprotonation of simple terminal <b>aziridines</b> with lithium 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidide (LTMP) or lithium dicyclohexylamide (LiNCy 2) generates trans-alpha-lithiated terminal <b>aziridines.</b> These latter species can then undergo dimerization or isomerization reactions {{depending on the}} nature of the N-protecting group. alpha-Lithiated terminal <b>aziridines</b> bearing N-alkoxycarbonyl (Boc) protection undergo N- to C-[1, 2] migration to give N-H trans-aziridinylesters. In contrast, <b>aziridines</b> bearing N-organosulfonyl [tert-butylsulfonyl (Bus) ] protection undergo rapid dimerization to give 2 -ene- 1, 4 -diamines or, if a pendant alkene is present, diastereoselective cyclopropanation to give 2 -aminobicyclo[3. 1. 0]hexanes. All of these reactions were used as key steps in the preparation of synthetically and biologically important targets...|$|R

25|$|The {{toxicology}} of {{a particular}} <b>aziridine</b> compound depends on its structure and activity, although sharing the general characteristics of aziridines. As electrophiles, aziridines are subject to attack and ring-opening by endogenous nucleophiles such as nitrogenous bases in DNA base pairs, resulting in potential mutagenicity.|$|E
25|$|An amine {{functional}} group displaces the adjacent halide in an intramolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction to generate an <b>aziridine.</b> Amino alcohols {{have the same}} reactivity, but the hydroxy group must first be converted into a good leaving group. The cyclization of an amino alcohol is called a Wenker synthesis (1935), and that of a haloamine the Gabriel ethylenimine method (1888).|$|E
25|$|Some reports {{note that}} the use of gloves has not {{prevented}} permeation of <b>aziridine.</b> It is therefore important that users check the breakthrough permeation times for gloves, and pay scrupulous attention to avoiding contamination when degloving.

40|$|A new {{synthetic}} {{protocol for}} the LiAlH 4 -promoted reduction of non-activated <b>aziridines</b> under microwave conditions was developed. Thus, ring opening of 2 -(acetoxymethyl) <b>aziridines</b> provided the corresponding beta-amino alcohols, {{which were then}} used as eligible substrates in the synthesis of 5 -methylmorpholin- 2 -ones via condensation with glyoxal in THF. The same procedure was applied for the preparation of novel 5 (R) - and 5 (S) -methylmorpholin- 2 -ones starting from the corresponding enantiopure 2 -(hydroxymethyl) <b>aziridines.</b> Additionally, 2 -(methoxymethyl) - and 2 -(phenoxymethyl) <b>aziridines</b> were treated with LiAlH 4 under microwave irradiation, giving rise to either isopropylamines or 1 -methoxypropan- 2 -amines depending on the reaction conditions...|$|R

2500|$|The {{reaction}} mechanism for this reaction {{is not clear}} and several potential pathways exist.
