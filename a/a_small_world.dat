5|$|Once {{the journey}} resumes, the train moves across an {{overpass}} and passes by the façade of the It's <b>a</b> <b>Small</b> <b>World</b> water-based dark ride attraction before reaching a fuel pump {{disguised as a}} boulder, where the train stops if the locomotive needs to be refueled. From this point, the train cuts across an access road and goes underneath the track of the Disneyland Monorail before stopping at Tomorrowland Station in the Tomorrowland section.|$|E

5|$|Also during 1956, the Fantasyland Depot, a new {{station with}} a Medieval theme and {{consisting}} of a covered platform with no station building, was created for the DRR in the Fantasyland section. By the time this new station was added, the DRR's system of having one train assigned to a single station and using sidings to pass trains stopped at stations was abandoned and replaced by the current system where each train stops at every station along the railroad's route. Fantasyland Depot was removed by July 1966 when the It's <b>a</b> <b>Small</b> <b>World</b> attraction, originally built for the 1964 New York World's Fair, was installed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the phenomenon of}} strategic technology alliances. It is proposed {{that the concept of}} <b>small</b> <b>worlds,</b> which has been adopted from mathematical graph theory, is a useful model to combine two theoretical streams that have previously analyzed this phenomenon. These are the theory of social capital and the theory of structural holes. We outline <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>worlds</b> model, and apply to data on strategic technology alliances. We find that networks of strategic technology alliances can indeed be characterized as <b>small</b> <b>worlds,</b> and that this has favourable implications for knowledge transfer. There are, however, also important differences between two different technology fields that we consider: chemicals and food, and electricals. ...|$|R
