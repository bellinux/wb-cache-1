5|$|At the 30 Rock studios, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), {{the stars}} of TGS, decide {{they want to help}} the sick crew. They think <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> crew soup but are too lazy to do it; instead they decide that {{laughter}} is the best medicine. Jenna and Tracy, dressed as clowns, put on a very unsuccessful show at the TGS stage where they end up throwing a pie on Liz's face. The crew stands up for Liz until they see the red dot where she received the shot. She confesses that she chose the vacation over the crew, as she later was told by Cerie that the hotel had rooms available, which results in the crew hating her for it.|$|E
5|$|Since Nagpal's {{suspension}} came {{to public}} view, {{it has been}} alleged that Samajwadi Party leader Narendra Bhati, who has cabinet-minister rank as the chairperson of the UP State Agro Industrial Corporation Limited, was responsible for getting her abruptly suspended because he was frustrated by Nagpal's drive against illegal mining. Bhati was later recorded on video boasting <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> officer suspended within 40 minutes. Other leaders of the Samajwadi party such as Azam Khan and Naresh Agarwal have issued statements supporting the suspension order.|$|E
5|$|The Heinz {{executive}} {{speaks with}} Don about his daughters' obsession with The Rolling Stones, and floats an idea <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> <b>The</b> Rolling Stones to do {{a commercial for}} Heinz. Don agrees, though he is unimpressed with the idea. Harry and Don make a Saturday night trip to a Rolling Stones concert to meet with Stones manager Allen Klein. They end up making conversation backstage with two pot-smoking female fans. When Harry leaves {{with one of the}} girls to talk with Klein, Don waxes poetic with one over her love for the band. She makes an insulting comment about the older generation. Don responds that the older generation is simply worried for youth. Harry fails miserably at his attempt to meet with The Rolling Stones, but Don is indifferent.|$|E

25|$|Swanson invited Will Hays {{for lunch}} and {{summarized}} the plot, naming the author and the sticking points. According to Swanson, Hays made a verbal promise {{that he would have}} no problem with the making of such a film. Swanson set <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> rights to the play by having Schenck pretend to buy it in the name of United Artists, never to be used. Thus {{they were able to get}} the story rights for $60,000 instead of the original $100,000. When news broke as to just what was intended with the play, the three authors threatened to sue. Swanson later contacted Maugham requesting that he write an original story that served as a sequel. The sequel would involve following what became of Sadie in Australia. Maugham agreed to write a new story (for $100,000) but a sequel was never made.|$|E
500|$|Westenra {{has been}} known as a vegetarian/pescetarian. In 2007, she was {{nominated}} for PETA's 'Sexiest Vegetarian'. However, when touring she sometimes has worried <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> appropriate amounts of nutrients. She was sometimes unable to obtain the more nutritious vegetables and other foods she preferred, and now on occasions she eats meat. In 2007, Westenra told The New Zealand Herald, [...] "I'm completely bursting the bubble now, aren't I? That's that ruined." ...|$|E
500|$|NTSB {{investigators}} {{noted that}} Fitzgeralds prior groundings {{could have caused}} undetected damage that led to major structural failure during the storm, since Great Lakes vessels were normally drydocked for inspection only once every five years. It was also alleged that when compared to Fitzgeralds previous captain, McSorley did {{not keep up with}} routine maintenance and did not confront the mates <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> requisite work done. After August B. Herbel, Jr., president of the American Society for Testing and Materials, examined photographs of the welds on Fitzgerald, he stated, [...] "the hull was just being held together with patching plates." [...] Other questions were raised as to why the USCG did not discover and take corrective action in its pre-November 1975 inspection of Fitzgerald given that her hatch coamings, gaskets, and clamps were poorly maintained.|$|E

500|$|By {{making the}} biopic, Dodd Darin and Spacey {{acknowledged}} the similar career experiences between Darin and Spacey. [...] "A {{lot of people}} doubted my dad's abilities, and Kevin's had doubters and naysayers," [...] Dodd commented. [...] "But both [...] {{were willing to take}} risks, and both were very resilient. My dad would always try new things. You could never pin him down. Kevin's career is similar." [...] David Evanier, author of Roman Candle: The Life of Bobby Darin (...) , said [...] "You can put Kevin's obsessiveness <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> film made right up there with Bobby's obsessiveness. He's also the ideal person to play Bobby. He has an uncanny physical resemblance to him, and he also has Bobby's intensity and dark side. Also, there's the connection with his mother. Bobby's mother's belief in him sent him soaring. Kevin's mother wanted him to make this film. Kevin sees the film as an act of devotion to his mother." ...|$|E
500|$|Holby City storylines {{are planned}} eight months in advance. The series utilises {{a number of}} scriptwriters, who are found and {{scheduled}} by script development editor Simon Harper. Harper receives around 20 speculative scripts a week, and also finds writers through the BBC Writers Academy, a course established in 2005 which guarantees its graduates {{the opportunity to work}} on prime time television. McHale teaches at the academy, and graduate Abi Bown {{went on to become a}} regular writer for Holby City. Harper also recruits writers through the BBC's Continuing Drama Shadow Scheme, open to writers from all levels of experience. He believes that scripts which demonstrate synthesis between guest and serial storylines are [...] "the spine of the show", and has stated that, [...] "Good, cracking, intelligent, ballsy dialogue is a must," [...] explaining: [...] "It's <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> characters' voices because the characters drive these shows. It is a love for and investment in these characters and the consistency of those characters." [...] Harper does not require that writers are necessarily familiar with the show, and would like to attract more female scriptwriters.|$|E
500|$|Talking to Nashville Scene, Lewis {{said that}} the songs [...] "weren't written off-the-cuff, but they were {{definitely}} recorded, not carelessly, but with a real effort to capture a live feeling, particularly with the vocals". Lewis continued, [...] "To me, it's a big step in a different direction...and {{to be able to}} sink into the vocal take while the band was playing was a very liberating experience for me." [...] Lewis told The A.V. Club, [...] "We played them on the road 100 times, so we knew that we could walk into the studio and record them the same way. [...] It wasn't really a studio record, but more of a live record in some ways. It was <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> band together and creating an atmosphere that lent itself to good chemistry between the band members and trying to capture as much of the record live as we could." [...] As [...] "a child of digital generation", Lewis had generally worked with Pro Tools, but wanted to capture the [...] "not-perfect sound" [...] of some of her favorite records.|$|E

500|$|Doug Storer, {{who was an}} {{advertising}} manager with the Blackman Company at the time, became convinced of Como's abilities after hearing him on his non-sponsored CBS Radio show. Storer produced a [...] radio program recording with Como and the Mitchell Ayres Orchestra which he brought to the advertising agency that handled the Chesterfield Cigarettes account. Initially, the agency liked {{the format of the}} show, but wanted someone else as the star, asking Storer to obtain the release of the singer they preferred, so he would be free for their new program. Storer decided to do nothing <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> singer released from his contract. When he was contacted by the agency some weeks later, saying they were ready to put the program on the air on NBC, Storer bluntly told them the man for their show was the man they had heard on the demo recording. The program was scheduled to make its debut in about a week; the only option was to hire Como for the show. Storer then arranged for Como's release from his CBS contract. On December 11, 1944, he moved from CBS to NBC for a new radio program, Chesterfield Supper Club.|$|E
2500|$|Amy Ratcliffe of IGN {{said of the}} episode, [...] "The {{return of}} Once Upon a Time served as {{set up for the}} final half of Season 5. They used the Underworld to bring back a ton of {{characters}} for quick check-ins, but Neal and Henry were the only ones who really strongly impacted the story and the Storybrooke team. Emotions fell flat across the board otherwise, except for the moment where Emma briefly saw Hook. They do have a compelling enough reason to stay in the Underworld -- though why Snow and Charming would spend so much time away from their newborn confuses me -- but overall, the episode was all <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> board ready." [...] Ratcliffe gave the episode a 7.0 rating out of 10.|$|E
2500|$|The fictional heroine in her novels, Temperance [...] "Tempe" [...] Brennan, {{is also a}} {{forensic}} anthropologist. [...] Her lifestyle closely mimics that of her creator, with Reichs stating that Brennan and she [...] "have the same CV" [...] and that [...] "Some of Tempe's personality traits are also mine", but {{there are differences in}} their personal lives such as the character's alcoholism. [...] A good portion of the novels are based on real life science, and Reichs has stated that she is [...] "fastidiously conscientious <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> science right". She has used experience from her career in her novels, and said about Déjà Dead that [...] "Everything I describe in the book, I actually did". In the novel Grave Secrets, she uses her experience from her visit to Guatemala.|$|E

2500|$|Between 2003 and 2004 Massow was {{director}} of another financial adviser firm, this time a tied agent of the Zurich Advice Network (previously Allied Dunbar). Massow had previously campaigned against {{what he saw as}} Allied Dunbar's anti-gay underwriting practices, but he claimed that [...] "they've moved on and, for the sake of my customers, so must I [...] if other gay financial advisers think they're doing the best for their customers by blackballing all the companies that were once out of line (there were about eight of them) when it came to gay issues – then their priorities are very strange. Financial advice is <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> best product – not petty grudge bearing." [...] Massow accepted a transitional loan of £330,000 to enable office relocation and staff training. However the arrangement was short-lived and ironically ended after a dispute between Massow and Zurich over Zurich's approach to insuring the gay clients in which the firm specialised. A long £13m legal case followed which, ultimately, Massow lost.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 July 1851, Bentley offered Melville ₤150 and [...] "half profits", that is, {{half the}} profits that {{remained}} after {{the expenses of}} production and advertising. On 20 July, Melville accepted, after which Bentley drew up a contract on 13 August. Melville signed and returned the contract in early September, {{and then went to}} New York with the proof sheets, made from the finished plates, which he sent to London by his brother Allan on 10 September. For over a month, these proofs had been in Melville's possession, and because the book would be set anew in England, he could devote all his time to correcting and revising them. He still had no American publisher, so the usual hurry <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> English publication to precede the American was not present. Only on 12 September was the Harper publishing contract signed. Bentley received the proof sheets with Melville's corrections and revisions marked on them on September 24. He published the book less than four weeks later.|$|E
2500|$|Preconceptions {{about what}} is an ‘Australian film’ contributed to the {{difficulty}} in finding funding. As an action film, Gabriel [...] "defied the norm and went way outside convention." [...] Producer Kristy Vernon states that [...] "many Australia movies have been either driven by artistic or personal motivations or, have focused on cultural imperatives leading to ‘uncommercial’ movies being produced. These types of movies are unlikely to give off a reasonable return to investors. The consequence {{of this is that}} the Australian finance and investment sectors have been reluctant to support the funding of the movie industry." [...] Abbess is critical of contemporary Australian films, joking that audiences [...] "fall asleep" [...] through them. He also believes there is a mentality in the Australian film industry to wait for government funding, rather than to earn and finance your own films. Everyone he spoke to <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> film made said that, [...] "even with a big, huge budget, you’re not going to get this made out here." [...] However, after he got one or two people on board support increased in a snowball effect.|$|E

2500|$|Five {{years after}} the {{publication}} of Out of Africa, Blixen published {{a collection of short stories}} called Winter's Tales (1942; [...] ). A departure from her previous Gothic works, the stories reflect the starkness of the times, occupation tinged with courage and pride, and hope for the future. The stories do not reflect resistance, but resilience, and explore the interdependence of opposites. She examines shame versus pride in [...] "The Heroine", cowardice and courage in [...] "The Pearls", master and servant in [...] "The Invincible Slave-Owners", and life versus death as well as freedom versus imprisonment in [...] "Peter and Rosa". [...] In [...] "Sorrow-acre", the best-known story of the collection, Blixen explores victimization and oppression. Because of the war, she had to be creative <b>about</b> <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> manuscript published, travelling to Stockholm and meeting with employees at both the American and British embassies. The Americans were unable to ship personal items, but the British embassy agreed, shipping the document to her publisher in the United States. Blixen did not receive further communication about Winter's Tales until after the war ended, when she received correspondence praising the stories from American troops who had read them in the Armed Services Editions during the conflict.|$|E
