5000|$|The {{pilaster}} is an [...] {{in classical}} architecture {{used to give}} the appearance of <b>a</b> <b>supporting</b> <b>column</b> and to articulate an extent of wall, with only an ornamental function. It consists of a flat surface raised from the main wall surface, usually treated {{as though it were a}} column, with a capital at the top, plinth (base) at the bottom, and the various other elements. In contrast to a pilaster, an engaged column or buttress can support the structure of a wall and roof above.|$|R

Due to its high stability, double-lattice design decreased {{the length of}} panels and make the bridge's parts easier. The presence of <b>a</b> <b>support</b> <b>column</b> in trusses allowed to simplify the design of cradles and baseframes, as well facilitated the design of connections between bearing floor beams and trusses. Furthermore, Beleloubski made improvements in the bridge structure by proposing the device of 'free carriageway', which later {{came to be called}} [...] "the Russian support method".|$|E

50|$|During {{the winter}} of 1916, heavy {{snowfall}} and a sudden thaw in the Alps created conditions ripe for avalanches. From the beginning of December, the snow pile up was recorded at 8-12 meters atop the summit. The Austro-Hungarian commander of the 1.Btl. KschRgt.III, Captain Rudolf Schmid, noticed the imminent danger his company faced. Out of fear his position would be soon untenable, Capt. Schmid wrote a request to his superior, Field Marshal Lieutenant Ludwig Goinger of the 90th Infantry Division. The appeal was ultimately turned down to vacate the base atop Gran Poz summit. In the eight days prior to the avalanche, additional heavy snowfall disrupted telephone lines of communication and left each outpost stranded {{with a lack of}} supplies.On , December 13, 1916, at 05:30, over 200 000 tons (approx. 1 million cubic meters) of snow and ice plunged down the mountainside directly onto the barracks. The wooden buildings packed with soldiers, collapsed {{under the weight of the}} avalanche, crushing the occupants. Of the 321 troops present, 229 were Kaiserschützen mountain infantry and 102 were Bosnians from <b>a</b> <b>support</b> <b>column.</b> Only a few were pulled to safety while 270 were buried alive. Only 40 of the bodies were ever recovered from the pileup. Among those who survived was Captain Schmid along with his aide, who escaped slightly injured.|$|E

5000|$|On March 20, 1990 at 9:20 a.m., a truck {{carrying}} {{fuel and}} lubricants in the plant's 230kv low voltage switchyard backed into <b>a</b> <b>support</b> <b>column</b> for the feeder line supplying {{power to the}} Unit 1-A reserve auxiliary transformer (RAT). At the time, the 1-B RAT was de-energized for maintenance and RAT 1-A was powering both trains of emergency electrical power, and the non-emergency electrical trains were being powered by back-feeding from the switchyard through the main step-up transformer to the 1-A and 1-B unit auxiliary transformers (UAT.) Additionally, Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) 1-B was out of service for planned maintenance. After the power loss, EDG 1-A failed to start due to a protective safety trip. The resulting {{loss of electrical power}} in the plant's [...] "vital circuits" [...] shut down the residual heat removal (RHR) pump that was cooling Unit 1 (which was nearing the end of a refueling outage) and prevented the back-up RHR from activating. Even though Unit 1 was offline at the time, residual heat from the natural decay of the radioactive fuel needed to be removed to prevent a dangerous rise in core temperature. While the non safety power was not interrupted, there was no physical connection between the vital and non-vital electrical trains which prevented the vital trains from receiving power from the unaffected path through the UATs.|$|E
5000|$|At the plant, Patrick, {{desperate to}} still make his black market deal, reveals his duplicity when {{he pulls a}} gun on Bixler, {{who is on the}} phone to the corporation. Patrick ties him up in the office. Shortly thereafter, another {{corporate}} manager shows up and, while looking through the plant for Bixler, is promptly eaten. Patrick, still unaware of the worm threat, takes Bixler down to the lower level, where he binds him to <b>a</b> <b>support</b> <b>column</b> and gags him. Daniel reaches his truck and then goes to Sepegal to warn Alicia about the worms; he insists they need to move the temporary clinic and its patients somewhere else. One of the local people, a nurse, says they could find a phone and help at the oil drilling facility not far away. When they arrive at the plant, Daniel and Alicia are confronted by one of Patrick's people, Bana, who only participated in the theft scheme to help his people; he lets Daniel and Alicia inside when a worm appears behind them, ready to kill. Alicia theorizes that the worms are a type of organism that has been released from stasis because of the pumping of hot water deep into the earth. If the pumping stops, no new worms should be [...] "hatched." [...] In Sepegal, Phillip and the nurse, Thuan, are drawing water from the well when Thuan is sucked in by a worm and killed. Phillip and Steffi run back to the clinic as the worms begin to surround it.|$|E
50|$|Seeing that Terese is {{drinking}} a lot, Brad suggests they {{take part in}} an Alcohol-free August. Terese has drink within days of starting, and Sheila Canning (Colette Mann) suggests to Brad that Terese has an alcohol problem. Terese agrees to get help, but lies to her family about attending Alcoholics Anonymous. When Brad finds out, they argue, and Brad leaves the house. Brad confesses his feelings to Lauren and they have sex. They agree not to tell Terese when they learn that she is serious about getting help for her alcoholism. However, Terese finds out and she and Brad separate, with Brad moving into a motel. Brad and Terese's youngest child, Piper (Mavournee Hazel), returns home from Canada during a family argument. Brad stays with Lauren while he looks for his own place, but when they become a couple, he moves in permanently. Brad is head-hunted by Eden Hills Grammar, but he decides to fight the closure of Erinsborough High with Susan. They organise a sleep-out protest at the school, but a fire engulfs the building. Brad finds Lauren and Terese trapped under some lockers and he manages to free Lauren, before promising to return for Terese. Terese survives with burns, and Lauren breaks up with Brad so he can help Terese recover. However Lauren and Brad eventually get back together, and he moves in with her. He also decides to become Doug's carer when Pam cannot look after him any longer. Brad is nominated for Erinsborough Citizen of the Year for his outreach program, but the venue, Lassiter's Hotel, explodes before the ceremony. Josh dies after he is pinned beneath <b>a</b> <b>support</b> <b>column,</b> devastating Brad. Hours later Brad is reunited with his eldest son Ned (Ben Hall), before Doug collapses and dies. Brad wins Citizen of the Year, but at the presentation the drone footage of him kissing Lauren is played, embarrassing Brad. Ned later admits he submitted the footage. Ned develops feelings for Lauren and kisses her, though regrets it and convinces her to keep quiet. When Piper finds out, she forces them to confess to Brad, who is devastated. Ned leaves, and Brad and Lauren's relationship is strained for a while.|$|E

40|$|A macro {{model is}} {{proposed}} for disproportionate collapse analysis of reinforced concrete flat-plate structures. The macro model consists of connector beam elements for the slab near columns and shell elements for the slab outside critical sections. The macro model simulates the complex behavior associated with flexure, shear, torsion, punching failure, and failure propagation. The model is first validated by test results of slab-column connections subjected to different loading conditions and then {{applied to the}} collapse analysis of an older flat-plate building. By nonlinear dynamic and static analyses, the impact of dynamic loading on slab local force and deformation demands is examined.
