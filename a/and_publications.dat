40|$|The first {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to compute the time to completion <b>and</b> <b>publication</b> of original scientific publications for medical doctoral students in the UK. A second objective was to evaluate if PhD theses format (monograph or publication-based) can influence the time to completion <b>and</b> <b>publication</b> of original scientific publications. We assessed a small sample of free full text medical doctoral theses from universities in the United Kingdom (mostly from the University of Manchester), which have produced at least 2 original scientific publications by the end of the doctoral studies. The time elapsed between 2 consecutive publications from the same thesis was considered an approximation of the time to completion <b>and</b> <b>publication</b> of the second publication. In the case of prospective theses, the median time to completion <b>and</b> <b>publication</b> of original scientific publications from medical doctoral theses was 10. 17 months. We found that there was a statistically significant difference between the time (to completion <b>and</b> <b>publication)</b> medians of the publications from traditional theses format <b>and</b> of the <b>publications</b> from publication-based theses format. Time to completion <b>and</b> <b>publication</b> of original scientific publications for medical doctoral students needs to be further evaluated on a larger scale, based on more theses from several medical faculties in the UK...|$|R
