50|$|Depending on {{the level}} of {{resource}} recovery, material can be put through an <b>air</b> <b>classifier</b> which separates light organic material from heavy organic material. The separate streams are then loaded, by front end loaders, onto trucks either for further processing or for sale.

50|$|<b>Air</b> <b>classifiers</b> are {{commonly}} employed in industrial processes where a {{large volume of}} mixed materials with differing physical characteristics need to be separated quickly and efficiently.

Cardboard {{is removed from}} the mixed paper and the most common types of plastic, PET (#1) and HDPE (#2), are collected. This separation is usually done by hand but has become automated in some sorting centers: a spectroscopic scanner is used to differentiate between different types of paper and plastic based on the absorbed wavelengths, and subsequently divert each material into the proper collection channel.|$|R
50|$|You cannot use VSI mill 'as is'. It {{requires}} organized feeding, an air stream, and its cleaning from product (dust). Therefore, a full complete {{grinding line}} {{consists of a}} feeder, an elevator, a VSI mill with an <b>air</b> <b>classifier,</b> a cyclone, a fan and a bag filter.

50|$|Q-11 was {{received}} in 55-gallon drums. The drums were deheaded before processing and were conveyed through a thawing tunnel, which also provided surge capacity of deheaded drums. The drums were lifted {{to the top}} of the building by a skip hoist where they were emptied into a surge hopper that feeds the magnetic separator and jaw crusher. From the jaw crusher, the one-half inch material passes through a rotary drum dryer to a system of conveyors, which conveys the material to a surge hopper that feeds the ring roll mill. The particle size output from the mill was controlled to about 100 mesh by an <b>air</b> <b>classifier</b> mounted directly on the mill. The undersized material was blown to a cyclone separator that was mounted directly above the first Gallagher sampler. The three Gallagher samplers in series each took a 10% cut of the stream fed to it, producing a sample approximately 0.1% of the original lot size. The main stream was conveyed to a drumming station where it was packaged in 55-gallon or 30-gallon drums for use in the Refinery. The official weight was taken at this point.|$|E

In this study, the broadening of its application for CDW recycling by the combined removal of unwanted stony materials and low-density organic compounds is discussed.

Experimental results have evidenced that under different operational conditions and using different contamination level {{it was possible to}} separate both the stony fraction and low-density materials in one single stage. The content of contaminants used in the system seemed do not have significant effect on the separation performance. Also, the separation extent was slightly sensitive to the jigging cycle used. In relation to the sorting of organic contaminants only, the performance obtained with the air jig can be considered comparable to that of sensor-based sorting and <b>air</b> <b>classifiers</b> systems.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} improve the {{separation}} efficiency in the air-solid phase, we proposed an innovative separation method called the active pulsing <b>air</b> <b>classifier,</b> which produce pulsing air by a pulsing air generator. In this way, the particles received a new acceleration action in each pulsing period, and then, it obtains a better performance than non-pulsing air separators in the laboratory scale. The dynamic equation of the motion particle in the active pulsing airflow was built up, showing that a higher density particle may get a small acceleration. The simulation results of airflow field show that the airflow turbulence acceleration will disperse the particles and a density dominant separation can be achieved. All high density particles, low density particles, and dust of waste catalyst can be acquired by the active pulsing <b>air</b> <b>classifier.</b> When the airflow velocity is 3. 33 m/s, the frequency of air pulsing is 7 / 3 Hz, the separation efficiency of the active pulsing <b>air</b> <b>classifier</b> reaches its maximum: 97. 63 %.

40|$|Abstract. Talc powder {{is widely}} used in {{building}} engineering, especially preparation for coating, waterproof material and ceramics. With increasing demands for building material quality, the requirement for the particle fineness and particle-size distribution of talc power becomes higher than ever. A new method of process parameters analysis on turbo <b>air</b> <b>classifier</b> for talc powder is put forward in this paper. The effect of the two process parameters on a classification performance index is reflected visually through the 3 -D drawing based on Matlab, so the one-dimensional process parameter analysis method is expanded to the two-dimensional process parameters analysis method. In the present study, a turbo <b>air</b> <b>classifier</b> is used as the classification system and fine talc powder is used as materials. The sample data is gathered through setting different process parameters. The experiment results show that process parameters analysis can be implemented quickly and visually.

40|$|Colon {{cancer is}} the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, and can be {{prevented}} by the removal of precancerous colon polyps. For colon diagnosis, computed tomography colonography (CTC) has been proposed as a minimally invasive technique, and computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems using CTC data are a rapidly evolving tool to localize, detect, and identify colon polyps. Colon segmentation is an essential and challenging step {{in the development of}} CAD systems. To accurately segment the whole colon using CTC data, we propose a fully automatic method. In this work, the whole body region excluding the lungs is first localized to narrow the search region and lower computation burden. Inside the body of the test case, a pre-trained colon atlas probability map is fitted using anatomy constraints to localize parts of the colon as seeded regions. Then, region growing is applied to generate an initial 3 D segmentation. Below colon <b>air,</b> discriminative <b>classifiers</b> are used to classify regions into colon-tagged materials or non-colon regions, and a fuzzy connectedness segmentation method is applied. Combining colon air and tagged residuals, the whole colon is extracted from CTC data.

40|$|Dry powder {{administration}} of adenosine {{by use of}} an effective inhaler may be an interesting alternative to nebulisation of adenosine 5 '-monophosphate in bronchial challenge testing, because of a shorter administration time and more consistent delivered fine particle dose over the entire dose range. In this study, we tested various powder formulations and classifier based dispersion principles and investigated the in vitro performance {{of the most promising}} formulation/classifier combination in a new test inhaler system. Spray-dried formulations of either pure adenosine (100 %) or adenosine and lactose as diluent (1 % and 10 % adenosine) were prepared to cover the entire expected dose range for adenosine (0. 01 - 20 mg). All three powders, in all 12 suggested doses, dispersed well with the newly developed test inhaler with a multiple <b>air</b> jet <b>classifier</b> disperser, into aerosols with an average volume median diameter of 3. 1 mu m (3. 0 - 3. 3 mu m). For eleven out of 12 dose steps, the fine particle fractions < 5 mu m as percent of the loaded dose varied within the range of 67 - 80 % (mean: 74 %). The new test concept allows for more consistent aerosol delivery over the entire dose range with narrower size distributions than nebulisation and thus may improve adenosine administration in bronchial challenge testing.

40|$|Engineering {{design work}} {{relies on the}} ability to predict system performance. A great deal of effort is spent {{producing}} models that incorporate knowledge of the underlying physics and chemistry {{in order to understand the}} relationship between system inputs and responses. Although models can provide great insight into the behavior of the system, actual design decisions cannot be made based on predictions alone. In order to make properly informed decisions, it is critical to understand uncertainty. Otherwise, there cannot be a quantitative assessment of which predictions are reliable and which inputs are most significant. To address this issue, a new design method is required that can quantify the complex sources of uncertainty that influence model predictions and the corresponding engineering decisions. Design of experiments is traditionally defined as a structured procedure to gather information. This thesis reframes design of experiments as a problem of quantifying and managing uncertainties. The process of designing experimental studies is treated as a statistical decision problem using Bayesian methods. This perspective follows from the realization that the primary role of engineering experiments is not only to gain knowledge but to gather the necessary information to make future design decisions. To do this, experiments must be designed to reduce the uncertainties relevant to the future decision. The necessary components are: a model of the system, a model of the observations taken from the system, and an understanding of the sources of uncertainty that impact the system. While the Bayesian approach has previously been attempted in various fields including Chemical Engineering the true benefit has been obscured by the use of linear system models, simplified descriptions of uncertainty, and the lack of emphasis on the decision theory framework. With the recent development of techniques for Bayesian statistics and uncertainty quantification, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo, Polynomial Chaos Expansions, and a prior sampling formulation for computing utility functions, such simplifications are no longer necessary. In this work, these methods have been integrated into the decision theory framework to allow the application of Bayesian Designs to more complex systems. The benefits of the Bayesian approach to design of experiments are demonstrated on three systems: an <b>air</b> mill <b>classifier,</b> a network of chemical reactions, and a process simulation based on unit operations. These case studies quantify the impact of rigorous modeling of uncertainty in terms of reduced number of experiments as compared to the currently used Classical Design methods. Fewer experiments translate to less time and resources spent, while reducing the important uncertainties relevant to decision makers. In an industrial setting, this represents real world benefits for large research projects in reducing development costs and time-to-market. Besides identifying the best experiments, the Bayesian approach also allows a prediction of the value of experimental data which is crucial in the decision making process. Finally, this work demonstrates the flexibility of the decision theory framework and the feasibility of Bayesian Design of Experiments for the complex process models commonly found in the field of Chemical Engineering. by Kenneth T.

40|$|The {{aggregate}} {{industry in}} Sweden is investigating methods {{to improve the}} quality of manufactured sand (aggregate smaller than 2 mm produced by crushing rock) for concrete production. A common way to improve the shape of the particles is to use a vertical shaft impact (VSI) crusher. However, the crushing process creates a large amount of fines (particles smaller than 63 mu m) that are not desirable in concrete mixes. The aggregate industry in Sweden is therefore investigating methods to reduce the amount of fines produced by the manufacturing of sand. One method being investigated is air classification. A centrifugal <b>air</b> <b>classifier</b> used in the aggregate industry was investigated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to improve the understanding of the influence of the geometric design of the classifier on the cut size and the resulting particle size distribution. Simulations were performed with a CFD model using an Euler-Lagrange approach.

40|$|Abstract — The <b>air</b> <b>classifier</b> is an {{equipment}} that finds its major applications in mineral processing plants. One of its utility is {{to separate the}} finer particles from the coarse particles to provide the required size of particle output. Air classifiers use various principles of operation depending on their prerequisite and usage. Various running parameters of the air classifiers can be varied to obtain the desired output particle sizes which are governed by specific particle size distribution curves. The <b>air</b> <b>classifier</b> considered in the paper {{is based on a}} ‘deflector wheel ’ principle. These deflector wheels are the rotors. During a trial run on a dynamic balancing machine the rotors failed structurally resulting in their permanent plastic deformation. This indicated a fault in the design; thus requiring failure analysis and restructuring of the same. This research paper points out an alternative to the current design keeping in mind the constraints of the system. The authors have employed the procedure of calculating the failure manually by an analytical approach. Later on, the design was examined and verified using a well-known Finite Element Analysis software followed by the development of conceptual designs and then choosing the most optimum one. The optimized design offered structural integrity to the rotor with minimal reduction in area, and hence the performance...|$|E
40|$|Aggregates {{are defined}} as {{particles}} of rock which in combination are used as a civil engineering material. It is used in bounded form in asphalt and concrete. Historically natural sand {{has been used as}} fine aggregates for concrete production in Sweden. Due to environmental reasons the Swedish government is limiting the extraction of natural sand resources. Manufactured sand is therefore being investigated in Sweden as a replacement product. Properties of the fine aggregates such as shape and particle size distribution are affecting the qualities of both the uncured and finished concrete. It is possible to produce manufactured sand with a good shape; however the crushing process results in a relatively large amount of fines (particles smaller than 63 µm). Research shows that the amount of fines in manufactured sand affects concrete properties such as, workability, water demand, drying shrinkage, compressive and flexural strength. To achieve a good concrete the manufactured sand should have somewhere between 5 - 10 mass percent of fines depending on rock type. It is common that manufactured sand has around 15 - 25 mass percent of fines after the crushing stage. In this thesis, dry air classification has been investigated {{to reduce the amount of}} fines in manufactured sand. There exists a number of air classifiers produced for different industrial use. This work has investigated four different air classifiers using different design approaches. Two air classifiers using an internal aerodynamic cycle and two with an open aerodynamic cycle. Both of the air classifiers with internal aerodynamic cycle investigated in the performed research are based around a centrifugal-crossflow separation zone. The classification process are for both of these air classifiers controlled by two fans, the circulating fan and the separator fan. The circulating fan creates the internal circulating air flow. The air flow created by the separator fan changes the cut size. Experiments performed on the air classifiers showed that it was possible to reduce the amount of fines from 15 mass percent to 5 mass percent. The investigated air classifiers with an open aerodynamic cycle were a two-stage <b>air</b> <b>classifier</b> and a mobile <b>air</b> <b>classifier.</b> The first stage of the two-stage <b>air</b> <b>classifier</b> used the same design as the mobile <b>air</b> <b>classifier</b> and is designed around a gravitational-crossflow separation zone modified to allow for recirculation of particles towards the separation zone. The second stage is based around a vertical standing centrifugal-counterflow zone modified to allow for recirculation of material. Both air classifiers can produce a product with the desired amount of fines. The performed empirical measurements and CFD simulations showed that the recirculation is important for the classification process, reducing the influence of particle to particle interaction. In conclusion, air classification has been technically proven to be able to reduce the amount of fines in the finished product. The classification result will depend on the chosen technology...|$|E

In this study, it is shown {{that the use of}} multiple <b>air</b> <b>classifier</b> technology enables effective dispersion of large amounts of micronised powder (up to 25 mg). X- 50 -values of the aerosol from laser diffraction analysis obtained with the Twincer((R)) disposable inhaler concept (containing multiple <b>air</b> <b>classifier</b> technology) are practically the same as that for the pure drug in the range of dose weights between 0 and 25 mg. Only for the highest dose weights, a minor fraction (5 - 7. 5 %) of small agglomerates (S- 15 mu m) is released from the inhaler. Moreover, the size distribution of the aerosol is practically the same at 1 and 4 kPa. Cascade impactor results confirm the good performance of the multiple classifier concept. Unprocessed micronised particles or soft spherical agglomerates can be used, and special particle engineering processes are not necessary. Only a minor fraction of coarse sweeper crystals in the formulation is desired to reduce the total inhaler losses for colistin sulfomethate to less than 5 - 6 % at 4 kPa. The classifiers can be designed to retain these crystals with more than 95 % efficiency. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

To achieve the highest possible deposition efficiency we investigated both the influence of different micronization techniques and different inhalers. The Novolizer with an <b>air</b> <b>classifier</b> as the powder de-agglomeration principle and the ISF inhaler were used for in vitro deposition experiments (cascade impaction). Micronization by milling as the classical approach and micronization by spray drying and spray freeze drying as advanced particle engineering techniques were investigated to determine whether advanced techniques are necessary to obtain high fine particle fractions (FPF) for this specific drug. It {{was found that the}} effects obtained with a certain micronization technique depended on the complex interaction of the physical characteristics of the drug substance with the type of formulation chosen, {{as well as with the}} de-agglomeration principle used. The combination of particle engineering by spray drying and the use of the <b>air</b> <b>classifier</b> technology resulted in a fine particle fraction of 66 %, while spray freeze drying yielded extremely fragile particles resulting in a FPF of only 25 %. The behaviour of the milled material showed similar trends as the spray dried material but FPF values were lower. It was concluded that when a drug is to be formulated as a powder for inhalation with high fine particle fractions, it is profitable to use advanced particle engineering techniques, however the applied technique should be tuned with the characteristics of the formulation type and process as well as with device development.

That which is coarsely sized (+ 40 mesh) can be sold to the market, while that which is finely sized is left unsold due to the market requirement that size must be of - 40 + 140 mesh. This research designed and constructed a Vertical <b>Air</b> <b>Classifier</b> in which the fine mineral {{is fed to a}} vertical chamber while air is blown from the bottom. The main variables are air flow rates and the length of contact between the air and the mineral (at length of 10 and 15 cm). The air is blown in by air compressor and its rate is controlled by a thin plate orifice. Experiments show that the classifier can eliminate more of the size of - 140 mesh as the air flow rate increases. The % fractional recovery at the size of - 140 mesh is found to decrease as the air flow rate increases. The length of contact between the air and the mineral influences the elimination and the % fractional recovery as well. When the length is shorter (at 10 cm), the elimination of the size - 140 mesh is better and the % fractional recovery at the size - 140 mesh in the underflow is lower. At the air flow rate of 6. 42 L/S and the length of contact of 10 cm, the size of - 140 mesh can be reduced from 37. 11 % in the feed down to 17. 70 % in the underflow.

The coarse fly ash was ground and classified again into 3 sizes. Four different sizes of fly ash {{from the process}} including the original fly ash were replaced cement 20 % by weight to make mortars. Chemical and physical properties of all fly ashes were tested. Setting times of fly ash-cement pastes and compressive strength of fly ash-cement mortars were investigated, and {{compared with those of}} the control. The results revealed that slight change in chemical composition of processed fly ashes did not give much effect on the compressive strength, whereas, the fineness of fly ash played a more important factor on the compressive strength development rate. More than 110 % of strength activity index of ground coarse fly ash mortar can be achieved as early as 1 to 3 days since the coarse fly ash is not in crystalline phase...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the breakage actions of solid particles observed in a new generation fluid energy micronizer being set up at our laboratories. The attention has been focussed in particular on breakage caused by interparticle collision, particle impact against a fixed surface, interparticle attrition and particle against wall of jet mill attrition. We have also studied the influence of grain size distribution, maximum particle size, flow rate and characteristics of the solid to be processed, {{as well as of}} flow rate and pressure of injected air on the above mechanism. Lastly, the operating parameters of a dynamic <b>air</b> <b>classifier</b> in closed circuit with the micronizer for recovering the fine fraction and automatically recycling the oversize, have been optimized. The findings of this investigation have been used to design, build and fine tune a micronizer capable of controlling the top size of a product having average particle size that meets market requirements for fine powders, while keeping power consumption relatively low. ...|$|E
40|$|Considering the {{difference}} of drag coefficients of particles moving through areas of varying Reynolds numbers, an extra-mass force acting on particles in the active pulsing air field was introduced. Models of the dynamic motion in which the particles both in Stokes and Newtonian fluids, follow as they move in the pulsing air flow were developed. And a computer numerical simulation was carried out that showed the traces of particles with different densities and diameters, but similar aerodynamic characteristics, as they moved through the turbulent flow, to modify and define {{the parameters of the}} models. The motion law of tracing spheres was studied in a laboratory active pulsing <b>air</b> <b>classifier</b> with a high-speed video camera and motion particle analyzer. The mechanism of active pulsing air classification was studied. The results show that simulation can predict the observed results with artificial tracing spheres separated by the laboratory equipment. The comparison of the simulation and laboratory experiment results show that the relative errors of velocities are less than 8 % for lighter particles and less than 5 % for heavier particles...|$|E
