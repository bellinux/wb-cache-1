40|$|One {{important}} part of generating code for DSP processors is to {{make good use of}} the address generation unit (AGU). In this paper we divide the code generation into three parts: (1) scheduling, (2) <b>address</b> register <b>assignment,</b> and (3) storage layout. The goal is to nd out if solving these three subproblems as one big integrated problem gives better results compared to when scheduling or <b>address</b> register <b>assignment</b> is solved separately. We present optimal dynamic programming algorithms for both integrated and non-integrated code generation for DSP processors. In our experiments we nd that integrationis benecial when the AGU has 1 or 2 address registers; for the other cases existing heuristics are near optimal.

50|$|In IPv4 {{it is very}} {{difficult}} for an organization to get even one globally routable multicast group assignment, and the implementation of inter-domain solutions is arcane. Unicast <b>address</b> <b>assignments</b> by a local Internet registry for IPv6 have at least a 64-bit routing prefix, yielding the smallest subnet size available in IPv6 (also 64 bits). With such an assignment it is possible to embed the unicast address prefix into the IPv6 multicast address format, while still providing a 32-bit block, the least significant bits of the address, or approximately 4.2 billion multicast group identifiers. Thus each user of an IPv6 subnet automatically has available a set of globally routable source-specific multicast groups for multicast applications.|$|R
