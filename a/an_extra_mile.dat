50|$|In 2013, the T5 {{engine was}} revamped before {{the launch of}} the Drive-E arrival. Among the tweaks to the T5 power plant is a boost in engine {{compression}} to 9.5:1 from 9.0, engine torque peaks at 4200 rpm and engine management changes provide faster gear changes and upshifts when the 6-speed automatic gearbox is in the sport mode. Output remains the same over 2012 at 250 bhp and 266 lb ft of torque, although there is a provision for overboost from the turbo which bumps the torque number to 295 lb.-ft. The changes in compression ratio helps the S60 T5 deliver <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> <b>mile</b> of mpg in the city and combined cycle. Front-drive versions are rated at 21 city/30 highway for a combined of 24, while the AWD model is 1 mpg less across the board.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test Rosabeth Moss Ranter’s (1997) {{structural}} theory of organisational behaviour in public hospital’s nursing manager population in the Northern Province. Specifically, it is the examination of the relationship between nurse managers’ perceptions of organisational commitment and job-related empowerment in their current work environment, a replication study of McDermott (1994), and Dubuc (1995). Ranter (1993) sees power in the organisation as being derived from the structural conditions, not from personal characteristics or socialisation effects. Therefore the determination of how much power anybody has in the organisation depends on formal characteristics of the job, and the development of informal alliances; these influence access to the sources of job-related empowerment i. e. information, support, resources and opportunity for growth and advancement. Organisational commitment for the {{purpose of this}} study is defined as “making the welfare of the organisation as one’s responsibility; the willingness to go <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> <b>mile</b> for the benefit of the organisation or the client without being exploited”.

Reason behind this immediate attention is fast depletion of conventional resources {{and their impact on}} climate change. The present research paper is in the area of training and development of existing workforce of emerging economies which heavily depends on the attributes of human being known as ability to “Learn, Unlearn and Relearn”. The research is further concentrates on energy and environment sector. The principle tool used for research is innovative application of 5 D Module which says – Define, Design, Deliver, Deploy and Document. This research will help in creating an immediate impact in organisation culture and creates a paradigm shift towards sustainable development and catering towards immediate concern of climate change. The research application will help organization to proactively work towards carbon trading and make a transitional move towards Sustainable Development...|$|E

40|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} regarding the effects of high staff turnover on the smooth running of various institutions. The {{purpose of this study}} is to establish the effect of staff turnover on performance of employees in the North West Provincial Department of South Africa. Questionnaires and document analysis were blended to capture authenticity and exhaustiveness of the data. Participants included the 70 employees in the said department who all filled and returned the questionnaire. Both inferential and descriptive statistics were used to present the results. A chi-square analysis was used as a method for data analysis in this study. Descriptive statistics were also used to describe the profiles of employees. The findings showed that the majority of employees are dissatisfied due many reasons and this causes lots of voluntary resignations among employees. Low productivity in the department is as a result of employee dissatisfaction borne as a result of management’s ignorance. The study recommends that the department should improve on mechanisms of getting feedback from its staff members regarding problems that have been identified as causes of high staff turnover rates. In addition, staff taking over duties performed by those who exited must be given proper orientation and recognition for going <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> <b>mile.</b> It was further recommended to the management of this organisation to give an exceptional attention to controllable factors such as, performance appraisals, salaries, interrelations between staff, orientation of newly appointed employees, etc. A relevant continual training was also recommended to prepare employees for promotions and development...|$|E
40|$|A {{framework}} for analyzing drive-access transit at a regional level is developed in this research. This framework is intended primarily for in-house use by regional transit agencies, yet {{has implications for}} the regional community at large. This framework serves {{as a tool for}} understanding and communicating what drive-access transit is, its significance to the regional transportation system, and the behavior of regional drive-access transit users. This framework emphasizes the utilization of GIS technology for both the analysis and communication of information relating to drive-access transit. It also focuses scholarly attention on drive-access transit in general and on kiss-and-ride in particular. The framework is applied to the Boston Metropolitan Region as a primary case study. Data from a variety of regional sources are utilized. GIS technology is used to visualize drive-access transit's regional significance in terms of total ridership, mode share, and drive-access transit facilities' utilization rates. A sub-mode choice model and a station choice model are developed for both rapid transit and commuter rail drive-access transit users. These models depend on the CTPS Emme/ 2 network model and the MIT Boston Regional TransCAD network model for the rapid transit and commuter rail models, respectively. The MIT Boston Regional TransCAD network model is intended to support on-going research, {{beyond the scope of this}} thesis, as part of the collaborative MBTA/MIT transit research effort. As a result of the application of the analytical framework, key findings and specific recommendations related to drive-access transit are reported for the Boston Metropolitan Region. (cont.) Key findings include: · approximately 46 percent of the region's population lives beyond normal walking distance of transit services; * drive-access transit accounts for 69 percent of overall commuter rail ridership and 18 percent of overall rapid transit ridership; * drive-access transit accounts for 31 percent of rapid transit ridership in the 50 outermost rapid transit stations; * the MBTA has a significant investment in station parking facilities, parking fees represent an increasingly important part of the MBTA's operating budget, and parking fees in the region evidence no spatial correlation; * 71 percent of regional parking facilities reached 85 percent of capacity, many of them filling hours prior to the departure of the last morning peak train; * commuter rail station choice is dependent on access distance, parking capacities, and transit fares, with travelers willing to drive <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> <b>mile</b> if it results in savings of more than $ 0. 90 on their transit fare; * rapid transit station choice is dependent on access distance, parking capacities, and transit trip distances, with travelers willing to drive <b>an</b> <b>extra</b> <b>mile</b> if it results in transit trip reduction of more than 3. 3 miles; * sub-mode choice for both commuter rail and rapid transit users depends on access distance, automobile availability, and the number of vehicles owned per capita. Recommendations included: * Making drive-access transit and particularly kiss-and-ride a regional transportation priority. * Utilizing the developed models temporarily for modeling proposed services and policy implications until better data can be collected for a more complete model estimation process. (cont.) * Promote drive-access transit, especially kiss-and-ride and carpooling to parking stations, through targeting responsive demographic markets, and through incentives such as reduced transit fares, parking fees, or preferential parking treatment. This research is an important initial step in assessing drive-access transit and its regional transportation role. by James Barrett Sorensen. Thesis (S. M.)
