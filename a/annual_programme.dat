25|$|After {{retiring}} from first-class cricket in 1984, he emigrated to South Africa, where he coached cricket and hockey at high schools. He also {{became involved in}} the Avendale Cricket Club in Athlone, Cape Town. He preferred to join a 'coloured' club rather than a 'white' one in apartheid South Africa. He was an inspiration to Avendale and was instrumental in assisting the club to grow and be successful.

25|$|The {{house and}} gardens {{are open to}} {{visitors}} by guided tour {{in the summer and}} by appointment at other times. Guided tours focus upon the historical context of the house, the ancient mythological and religious origins of the Greek Revival, connections with Freemasonry, the Agricultural Revolution, the Picturesque movement, and issues of interpretation of the Borghese Vase and the Parthenon Frieze. A musical instrument collection including pianos, harpsichords, two pipe organs and a modified five-manual Makin electronic are used for an <b>annual</b> <b>programme</b> of concerts. The latter served at St Columb's Cathedral, Derry for 12 years (whilst its predecessor was being repaired after the Troubles), and is used in particular to promote the music of the French symphonic writers such as Vierne and Widor. Its expansion from three to five manuals, with more than 150 stops, makes it one of the largest such instruments in Europe with more than 25,000 possible stop combinations. The other keyboards are tuned to an unequal temperament, such as Well or Meantone, which composers of the Classical and Romantic era relied upon to choose the key in which to write their compositions.|$|E
500|$|The Michael Faraday Prize {{is awarded}} by the Royal Society of London for [...] "excellence in {{communicating}} science to UK audiences". Named after Michael Faraday, the medal itself {{is made of}} silver gilt, and {{is accompanied by a}} purse of £2500. The prize was first awarded in 1986 to Charles Taylor for [...] "his outstanding presentations of physics and applications of physics, aimed at audiences from six-year-old primary school children to adults". It is awarded annually and unlike other Royal Society awards such as the Hughes Medal, it has been presented every year since its inception. [...] The winner is required to present a lecture as part of the Society's <b>annual</b> <b>programme</b> of public events, which is usually held in January of the following year; during the lecture, the President of the Royal Society awards the medal. Unlike other prizes awarded by the society, the committee has not always publicly provided a rationale. This has occurred five times—in 2004 to Martin Rees, in 2006 to Richard Fortey, in 2007 to Jim Al-Khalili, [...] in 2008 to John D. Barrow and most recently in 2009 to Marcus du Sautoy.|$|E
