5|$|Abnormalities in the ARH gene, {{also known}} as LDLRAP1, were first {{reported}} in <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>in</b> 1973. In contrast to the other causes, two abnormal copies of the gene are required for FH to develop (autosomal recessive). The mutations in the protein tend to cause {{the production of a}} shortened protein. Its real function is unclear, but it seems {{to play a role in}} the relation between the LDL receptor and clathrin-coated pits. People with autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia tend to have more severe disease than LDLR-heterozygotes but less severe than LDLR-homozygotes.|$|E
5|$|According to Josiffe's account, a {{homosexual}} liaison with Thorpe began that same evening, at Thorpe's mother's home in Oxted, and continued for several years. Thorpe, while acknowledging that a friendship developed, denied any sexual dimension in the relationship. He organised accommodation for Josiffe in London, and a longer-term stay with <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>in</b> Barnstaple, within the North Devon constituency. He paid for advertisements in Country Life magazine, {{in an effort}} to find work with horses for his friend, arranged various temporary jobs, and promised to help Josiffe to realise an ambition to study dressage in France. On the basis of Josiffe's claim that his father had died in an air crash, Thorpe's solicitors investigated whether any money was due, but found that Albert Josiffe was alive and well in Orpington.|$|E

5|$|In the Second World War {{thousands}} of children were evacuated from metropolitan areas such as London, Birmingham and Liverpool. One evacuee from Woolwich, Patricia Armstrong aged nine, was knocked down by a passenger train and killed on a Saturday afternoon in May 1943 while using the Gelynis foot crossing at Morganstown. She was lodged with <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>in</b> Morganstown. As air raids on Cardiff increased, even younger children from Radyr were evacuated to boarding schools at Rhoose and Bridgend.|$|E
5|$|Majungasaurus is {{classified}} {{as a member of}} the theropod clade Abelisauridae, which is considered <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>in</b> Linnaean taxonomy. Along with the family Noasauridae, abelisaurids are included in the superfamily Abelisauroidea, which is in turn a subdivision of the infraorder Ceratosauria. Abelisaurids are known for their tall skulls with blunt snouts, extensive sculpturing on the outer surfaces of the facial bones (convergent with carcharodontosaurids), very reduced (atrophied) forelimbs (convergent with tyrannosaurids), and stocky hindlimb proportions, among other features.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia {{has been}} {{classified}} into numerous families and subfamilies; in 1858 British entomologist Frederick Smith {{placed it in}} the family Poneridae, subfamily Myrmicidae. It {{was placed in the}} subfamily Ponerinae by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr in 1862. This classification was short-lived, as Mayr reclassified the genus into the subfamily Myrmicinae three years later. In 1877, Italian entomologist Carlo Emery classified the genus into the newly established subfamily Myrmeciidae, family Myrmicidae. Smith, who had originally established Myrmicidae as <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>in</b> 1851, reclassified it as a subfamily in 1858. He would again treat it as <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>in</b> 1871. Swiss myrmecologist Auguste Forel initially treated Poneridae as a subfamily and classified Myrmecia as one of its constituent genera, but later placed it in Ponerinae. William H. Ashemad placed the genus in the subfamily Myrmeciinae in 1905, but it was later placed back in Ponerinae in 1910 by American entomologist William Morton Wheeler. In 1954, Myrmecia was placed into Myrmeciinae; this would be the last time the genus would be placed into a different ant subfamily.|$|E

5|$|On leaving Holloway, Davison {{became a}} live-in governess, and {{continued}} studying in the evenings. She saved {{enough money to}} enrol at St Hugh's College, Oxford, for one term to sit her finals; she achieved first-class honours in English, but could not graduate because degrees from Oxford were closed to women. She worked briefly at a church school in Edgbaston between 1895 and 1896, but found it difficult and moved to Seabury, a private school in Worthing, where she was more settled; she left the town in 1898 and became a private tutor and governess to <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>in</b> Northamptonshire. In 1902 she began reading for a degree at the University of London; she graduated with third-class honours in 1908.|$|E
5|$|Professorship brought Rimsky-Korsakov {{financial}} security, which {{encouraged him}} {{to settle down and}} to start <b>a</b> <b>family.</b> <b>In</b> December 1871 he proposed to Nadezhda Purgold, with whom he had developed a close relationship over weekly gatherings of The Five at the Purgold household. They married in July 1872, with Mussorgsky serving as best man. The Rimsky-Korsakovs had seven children. One of their sons, Andrei, became a musicologist, married the composer Yuliya Veysberg and wrote a multi-volume study of his father's life and work.|$|E
5|$|The melampittas are a family, Melampittidae, of New Guinean birds {{containing}} two enigmatic species. The {{two species}} {{are found in}} two genera, the greater melampitta in the genus Megalampitta and the lesser melampitta in the genus Melampitta. They are little studied and before being established as <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>in</b> 2014 their taxonomic relationships with other birds were uncertain, being considered at one time related variously to the pittas, Old World babblers and birds-of-paradise.|$|E

5|$|The trailer was {{designed}} to be emotional, allowing players to care for the characters and to be distinct from trailers for the game's competitors. The trailer does not show any actual gameplay, instead telling a short story about the game's world and the background behind its events. The development team also had the goal to show the inevitability and the helplessness of <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>in</b> a zombie outbreak. Upon its release on February 16, 2011, the trailer sparked public interest, and the community reaction led Techland to adjust the content of the actual game. It was met with a mixed reception from critics. Praise was directed at the trailer's new ideas, story, immersion and tone, however, it received criticism for lacking gameplay information and its depiction of a dead child. The trailer received multiple awards upon release.|$|E
5|$|These revivals {{could be}} made using {{pantograph}} machine engraving systems, which gave a cleaner result than historic typefaces whose master punches had been hand-carved, and allowed rapid development of <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>in</b> a large range of sizes. In addition, the new hot metal typesetting technology of the period created increasing availability and demand for new fonts. Among hot metal typesetting companies, Monotype's branches in Britain and the United States brought out separate versions, and the American branch of Linotype licensed that of ATF.|$|E
5|$|When {{his brother}} and {{sister-in-law}} were forced to move for business reasons, he bought his own house at 328 Mickle Street (now 330 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard). First {{taken care of by}} tenants, he was completely bedridden for {{most of his time in}} Mickle Street. During this time, he began socializing with Mary Oakes Davis—the widow of a sea captain. She was a neighbor, boarding with <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>in</b> Bridge Avenue just a few blocks from Mickle Street. She moved in with Whitman on February 24, 1885, to serve as his housekeeper in exchange for free rent. She brought with her a cat, a dog, two turtledoves, a canary, and other assorted animals. During this time, Whitman produced further editions of Leaves of Grass in 1876, 1881, and 1889.|$|E
