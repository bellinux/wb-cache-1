Even so, a tour was organised for journalists on 17 March, with members of the press being welcomed by Lord Ismay <b>and</b> <b>shown</b> around the Rooms by their custodian, Mr. George Rance.|$|E

In experiments on mice with tumour cells, it appeared to have antitumour effects when administered in combination with a preparation of Propionibacterium acnes in a 1994 Polish study. Researchers in 2004 reported that extracts of the fruit body inhibit the enzyme pancreatic lipase; it was the second most inhibitory of 100 mushrooms they tested.

5|$|Initially Bryant {{kept her}} {{concerns}} low-key, despite her pastor's pleadings to become involved.
