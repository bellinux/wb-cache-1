50|$|In {{electrical}} switches, including {{bimetallic strip}} based thermostats, the switch usually has hysteresis in the switching action. In these cases hysteresis is mechanically achieved via positive feedback within {{a tipping point}} mechanism.

50|$|Inelastic {{scattering}} {{heats up}} a molecule, {{so that in}} a second scattering the probability of electron emission is increased. This leads to an arc. Typically <b>arcing</b> <b>occurs</b> after lasing in nitrogen. The streamer in the spark gap discharges the electrodes only by means of image charge, thus when the streamer touches both electrodes most of the charge is still available to feed the arc, additional charge is stored on the distribution plates. Thus arcing in the spark gap starts before lasing.|$|E
50|$|Electric arc {{furnaces}} {{are also}} used for production of calcium carbide, ferroalloys and other non-ferrous alloys, and for production of phosphorus. Furnaces for these services are physically different from steel-making furnaces and may operate on a continuous, rather than batch, basis. Continuous process furnaces may also use paste-type, Søderberg electrodes to prevent interruptions due to electrode changes. Such a furnace {{is known as a}} submerged arc furnace because the electrode tips are buried in the slag/charge, and <b>arcing</b> <b>occurs</b> through the slag, between the matte and the electrode. A steelmaking arc furnace, by comparison, arcs in the open. The key is the electrical resistance, which is what generates the heat required: the resistance in a steelmaking furnace is the atmosphere, while in a submerged-arc furnace the slag or charge forms the resistance. The liquid metal formed in either furnace is too conductive to form an effective heat-generating resistance.|$|E

In such applications {{the corners of the}} conductor cross-section may be rounded to prevent high field intensities and <b>arcing</b> <b>occurring</b> at those points. [...] The insulators are electrically undesirable; they detract from the goal of having a purely air dielectric, add discontinuities to the line, and are potentially a point at which tracking can occur. In some components, there are points at which the lines need to be grounded, either directly or through a discrete component. In such circuits these grounding points can double as mechanical supports and the need for supporting insulators avoided.|$|R

5000|$|Electrons {{from the}} cathode collide with the anode material, usually tungsten, {{molybdenum}} or copper, and accelerate other electrons, ions and nuclei within the anode material. About 1% {{of the energy}} generated is emitted/radiated, usually perpendicular to {{the path of the}} electron beam, as X-rays. The rest of the energy is released as heat. Over time, tungsten will be deposited from the target onto the interior surface of the tube, including the glass surface. This will slowly darken the tube and was thought to degrade the quality of the X-ray beam. Vaporized tungsten condenses {{on the inside of the}} envelope over the [...] "window" [...] and thus acts as an additional filter and decreases the tubes ability to radiate heat. Eventually, the tungsten deposit may become sufficiently conductive that at high enough voltages, <b>arcing</b> <b>occurs.</b> The arc will jump from the cathode to the tungsten deposit, and then to the anode. This arcing causes an effect called [...] "crazing" [...] on the interior glass of the X-ray window. As time goes on, the tube becomes unstable even at lower voltages, and must be replaced. At this point, the tube assembly (also called the [...] "tube head") is removed from the X-ray system, and replaced with a new tube assembly. The old tube assembly is shipped to a company that reloads it with a new X-ray tube.|$|E

A brief review on cathodic arc properties serves {{as the starting point}} to better understand arcing phenomena in sputtering. Although <b>arcing</b> <b>occurs</b> in both metal and reactive sputtering, it is more of an issue in the reactive case. <b>Arcing</b> <b>occurs</b> if sufficiently high field strength leads to thermal runaway of an electron emission site. The role of insulating layers and surface potential adjustment through current leakage is highlighted. In the situation of magnetron sputtering with ''racetrack'', the need for a model with two spatial dimensions is shown.

40|$|Experimental and {{theoretical}} studies {{are made of}} a typical snap-action rocker switch, to establish the wear mechanisms in the pivoting contact. The rocker switch, used extensively in consumer goods, operates in the medium duty current range, (1 - 30 Amps). Highspeed photographic {{studies have shown that}} the main cause of wear is <b>arcing,</b> <b>occurring</b> during separation and bounce at the pivot contacts. To reduce the bounce a computer-based mathematical model of the system dynamics is developed and optimised; this results in recommended design changes. These changes are tested under full current endurance conditions, and show significant improvements in wear. The model of the switch dynamics relates the mathematics of motion to the bounce occuring at the pivot contact, without the influence of current. To show the effect of current and arcing, an automatic test system is developed for the controlled testing of electrical contacts. The system has the ability to evaluate arc energy, bounce times, and contact resistance. The results presented detail the influence of d. c current on contact bounce time, and identify the importance of the subsequent bounce time; which is defined for a single make operation, as the total duration of the bounces occurring after the first bounce. To compare the erosion profiles of the switch and test system, the system is operated under full load current endurance conditions, to evaluate wear. This comparison shows that the wear in the real switch contacts is greater, as result of the additional contact movement of slip and rolling. Arrow-Hart (Europe) Ltd, Plymouth, Devo...|$|R

40|$|In {{anticipation}} of the International Space Welding Experiment (ISWE) the effect of an electron beam was investigated on Nextel AF- 62 ceramic cloth designed to withstand temperatures up to 1427 C.

Further, the penetration time went up significantly both at longer and at closer standoff distances. A tentative explanation appears to fit the observed facts. The electrons in the beam generate positive ions by collisions with the contaminant gas molecules in the vacuum chamber.

The objectives of this study were to determine: 1) the movements of the buoy line in the water at various tidal stages, current strengths, lengths of line, and water depth, 2) if lead-core rope was a better alternative to nylon rope, 3) and if the manner of deployment of the gear affected the suspension of the line in the water and on the bottom. Diamond braided nylon (# 10) rope of varying length (20 ft. – 80 ft.) were used during 31 trials and stiffened (polypropylene lead-core) rope was used in four trials. Observations of the buoy line movements were captured with an Atlantis underwater camera attached to a Digital DPC- 1000 video recorder.

50|$|At high power, <b>arcing</b> can <b>occur</b> at {{the corners}} of the filter teeth due to strong {{electric}} fields being present at sharp corners. This limits the power-handling capability of the filter. The effect can be mitigated by rounding the edges of the teeth. Completely circular teeth are best of all for power handling.

For instance Matthaei describes a 1.2-1.64 GHz passband filter with rounded teeth and a wide stopband with a power-handling capability of 1.4 MW. A similar filter with circular teeth, on the other hand, can handle 2 MW.

This paper describes a plan of exploratory tests to determine the conditions under which flames will and will not propagate to the ends of pipes attached to coupling specimens of various sizes. An initial series of tests will be conducted by igniting a hydrogen gas mixture with a small spark at the interior of tube specimens of various diameters to determine the conditions that let the flame appear at the open end of the pipe. A second group of tests will be conducted on couplings attached to short tube ends and arranged to produce an arc that is exposed to the interior of the coupling when typical currents are conducted through the coupling. Such an arc would have a higher energy dissipation than the 0. 2 mJ spark often used to verify ignition sensitivity of flammable gasses, but most electrical arcs that might occur at fuel tube couplings would be significantly hotter, and more incendiary, than the standard 0. 2 mJ spark.

40|$|Titanium dioxide {{thin films}} were {{fabricated}} by anodisation of titanium foils in 1 mol/L of trichloroacetic acid under varying anodising parameters (voltage, current density and time) {{in order to}} determine the optimal processing conditions for maximal photocatalytic performance. The conditions used were a) voltage of 100 V with current densities of 10 and 20 mA/cm 2 and b) voltage of 200 V with current densities of 40 and 60 mA/cm 2; the anodising times were 1, 3, 5, 10, and 20 minutes for both sets of conditions. The mineralogical, microstructural, structural, and photocatalytic performance were evaluated using laser Raman microspectroscopy, glancing angle X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, focused ion beam milling, transmission electron microscopy and methylene blue degradation under UV irradiation. Anodisation tests illustrated that the voltage increased with time for all conditions: however at the higher current densities (40 and 60 mA/cm 2), dielectric breakdown occurred and this caused a voltage drop and caused detachment of the film as seen from the FIB and TEM images. Even though Raman Microspectroscopy showed that anatase was present in all the samples, GAXRD analysis was only able to reveal the presence of anatase in only two samples. White to grey spots were observed to be present on every sample except sample 1 (anodised at 1 min, 100 V, and 10 mA/cm 2) and these were determined to be either rutile or amorphous phase. SEM images showed that the numbers of depressions and delaminations increased with anodisation time and current density, and these observation confirmed that <b>arcing</b> <b>occurred</b> during the anodisation process. The thicknesses of the anodised samples were observed to increase with increase in the current densities as well. The photocatalytic performance was evaluated in terms of the degradation of methylene blue solution under UV irradiation. The results showed that the samples anodised at 40 and 60 mA/cm 2 showed better performance than the ones anodised at 10 and 20 mA/cm 2 owing to the difference in their microstructural characteristics The results showed that the microstructural effect was the major factor affecting the performance, rather than the mineralogy of the films. With increase in the anodisation time, current density, and voltage to higher values, the films grew thicker and arcing took place. The resultant volumetric and thermal stresses caused delaminations, formation of depressions, and detachment of the partially delaminated regions. These changes resulted in the surface having a rough texture and this increased the effective surface area, and thereby the number of active sites, for photocatalytic reactions and this was responsible for the enhancement of performance for these samples...|$|R
50|$|When PD, <b>arcing</b> or {{sparking}} <b>occurs,</b> {{electromagnetic waves}} propagate {{away from the}} fault site in all directions which contact the transformer tank and travel to earth (ground cable) where the HFCT is located to capture any EMI or EMP within the transformer, breaker, PT, CT, HV Cable, MCSG, LTC, LA, generator, large hv motors, etc. Detection of the high-frequency pulses will identify the existence of partial discharge, arcing or sparking. After PD or arcing is detected, {{the next step is}} to locate the fault area. Using the acoustic emission method (AE), 4 or more AE sensors are placed on the transformer shell where the AE and HFCT wavedata is collected at the same time. Bandpass filtering is used to eliminate interference from system noises.|$|R
