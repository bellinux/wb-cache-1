40|$|The Harlow {{ventilator}} {{which is}} designed for intensive therapy work can be utilized with the CAV closed circuit attachment for ventilation of the lungs during anaesthesia. A functional analysis of the Harlow ventilator which, together with the CAV Boyle unit, is presented and a description of its clinical utilization is given. The Harlow ventilator has been evaluated clinically and experimentally by Robinson and colleagues (1969). The present paper refers to another possible clinical use in anaesthesia. The apparatus was assembled as follows: the Harlow ventilator was coupled {{by means of a}} short corrugated tube to a Combined Automatic Ventilator (CAV) unit dosed circuit attachment for the Boyle anaesthetic machine (British Oxygen Co.). A Wright respirometer was inserted into the expiratory limb of the anaesthetic circuit. The pressure-operated expiratory valve of the Harlow ventilator was blocked with a clamp. An <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>reservoir</b> <b>bag</b> of 2 1. capadty was mounted on a Y-piece of the anaesthetic circuit. Frequency, inspiratory and expiratory time and inspiratory/expiratory ratios were measured with a chronometer. Measurement of tidal volume and minute volume were made with the Wright respirometer. The fresh gas flows to the CAV circuit were estimated from the Rotameter reading on the Boyle anaesthetic machine. The mean inspiratory flow rate delivered by the CAV unit was estimated by riming of the volume delivered during the inspiratory period with a chronometer. The pressure in the anaesthetic circuit was measured with a Drager manometer connected to the Y-piece (fig. 1).

Gross contamination was detected by broth sampling on occasions when swabbing failed to reveal contamination. The presence of up to 18 % by volume of residual air within the apparatus was detected. A method of ensuring elimination of all air is described and studies showed that disinfection was then complete.

40|$|All {{halothane}} vaporizers {{tested for}} leakage when turned off, leaked {{significant amounts of}} halo-thane and this may represent a hazard to patients liable to develop halothane hepatitis or malignant hyperpyrexia. The hazard from leaking vaporizers may be reduced considerably {{by the use of}} well-designed bypass units. Circuit contamination by halothane may still result from such sources as neoprene seals around flowmeters, breathing bags and anaesthetic hose which have had previous contact with halothane vapour, whether or not an apparatus is in use. The hazard from contami-nated hoses and bags may be reduced considerably by washing and then hanging in a halothane-free atmosphere for a day. The hazard from contaminated rubber or plastic components of the anaesthetic machine can be eliminated only by using one apparatus without the vaporizers having been attached at any time during its working life. Similarly, hazards may arise from trichloro-ethylene vaporizers and from circuit components contaminated with trichloroethylene. Lowe, Titel and Hagler (1971) have shown that the <b>anaesthetic</b> hoses and <b>reservoir</b> <b>bags</b> will absorb considerable quantities of halothane.

40|$|Tis article {{addresses}} the diﬀerent functions of anesthesia <b>reservoir</b> <b>bag</b> in a breathing system. A {{main purpose of}} the contribution was to explain complex interaction between the <b>reservoir</b> <b>bag</b> and fresh gas ﬂow during mechanical ventilation. The anesthesia <b>reservoir</b> <b>bag</b> is a collapsible gas container which is {{an essential component of}} most breathing systems. The anesthesia <b>reservoir</b> <b>bag</b> permits manual ventilation and acts as a visual or tactile indicator of spontaneous ventilation. The bag was excluded from traditional breathing system when the ventilator was in use. Discrepancies between the set and actual tidal volume can occur. However, on some anesthesia workstation systems, such as the Dräger Primus, the <b>reservoir</b> <b>bag</b> {{is an integral part of}} the breathing system during mechanical ventilation, where it serves as a reservoir for oxygen and anaesthetic gases. In mechanically ventilated patients, gases enter the bag from the fresh gas ﬂow during inspiration, when the decoupling valve closes. The safe administration of general anesthesia requires understanding of the technological advances in highly sophisticated anesthetic equipment. </p...|$|R

50|$|In some instances, {{a partial}} {{rebreathing}} mask can be used, {{which is based}} on a simple mask, but featuring a <b>reservoir</b> <b>bag,</b> which increases the provided oxygen concentration to 40-70% oxygen at 5-15 LPM.|$|R
50|$|The non-rebreather mask covers {{both the}} nose and mouth of the patient and {{attaches}} {{with the use of}} an elastic cord around the patient's head. The NRB has an attached <b>reservoir</b> <b>bag,</b> typically 1 liter, that connects to an external oxygen tank or Bulk Oxygen Supply system. Before an NRB is placed on the patient, the <b>reservoir</b> <b>bag</b> is inflated to greater than two-thirds full of oxygen, at a rate of 15 liters per minute (lpm). Approximately ¹⁄₃ of the air from the reservoir is depleted as the patient inhales, and it is then replaced by the flow from the O2 supply. If the bag becomes completely deflated, the patient will no longer have a source of air to breathe.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a mathematical model}} of a semi-closed anesthesia breathing circuit. The model comprises four perfect-mixing compartments (corresponding to the lung, the <b>reservoir</b> <b>bag,</b> and the two absorber cannisters), together with four tubes through which gas flows without mixing (corresponding to the inspiratory tube, the expiratory tube, the arm leading to the <b>reservoir</b> <b>bag,</b> and the anatomical dead space). For simplicity, only the case of spontaneous breathing is considered, and only three species of gases are included, namely oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide.

40|$|Five {{patterns}} of ventilation have been compared in dogs: (1) spontaneous ventilation at ambient pressure (SV); (2) intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV); (3) spontaneous ventilation at 0. 98 kPa positive airway pressure, delivered from a non-rebreathing circuit incorporating a 5 -litre <b>reservoir</b> <b>bag</b> and fresh-gas flow of twice the minute volume (CPAP (bag)); (4) spontaneous ventilation at 0. 98 kPa positive airway pressure, with the <b>reservoir</b> <b>bag</b> {{replaced by a}} weighted bellows (CPAP (bellows)) and (5) IPPV with 0. 98 kPa positive end-expiratory pressure (CPPV). CPAP significantly decreased the rate of respiration compared with SV. CPAP (bellows) resulted in a significant in-crease in tidal volume. Mean oesophageal pressure, right atrial pressure, pulmonary wedge pressure and pulmonary artery pressure increased during IPPV, CPAP (bag), CPAP (bellows), and CPPV compared with SV. There were no significant changes in mean systemic arterial pressure, cardiac output, PaOj, PaC 0 !, Ca 0 !, (Ca 0] — Cv 0,), (PAo, [...] Pa 0,) or pulmonary venous admixture.

Expiration is initiated by releasing {{the pressure on the}} bag. The inspiratory port is immediately closed and the expired gases pass to the atmosphere (fig. 1).

Fourteen academic dental staff members performed 10 ventilations on a manikin using the reservoir-supplemented device in comparison to the control BVM in a randomized order. Lung compliance was adjusted to 45 (high) and 4. 5 mL/mbar (low), and the lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LOSP) simulator to a pressure of 15 and 3 mbar, respectively, in different settings. Lower tidal volumes were observed with the new device than with the control BVM at high compliance with LOSP of 15 mbar (median 506 vs. 787 mL, respectively; p = 0. 0002) and LOSP of 3 mbar (median 544 vs. 794 mL, respectively; p = 0. 0006), as well as during ventilation at low lung compliance and LOSP of 3 mbar (median 131 vs. 163 mL, respectively; p = 0. 0342). No differences were detected at low lung compliance and LOSP of 15 mbar (median 175 vs. 194 mL; p = 0. 3804). Gastric inflation almost exclusively occurred in case of low lung compliance, being markedly lower with the new device than with the control device at 15 mbar LOSP (300 vs. 2225 mL, respectively; p = 0. 0006), and at 3 mbar LOSP (1138 vs. 3050 mL, respectively; p = 0. 0001).
