40|$|I {{examine the}} effects of the Great Recession on non-marital <b>and</b> <b>teen</b> births. The Recession could have led to {{reductions}} in non-marital <b>and</b> <b>teen</b> fertility or the Recession could have had null effects if non-marital <b>and</b> <b>teen</b> fertility are disconnected from economic factors. Using a panel of state-level fertility and economic data, I find that worse macro-economic conditions are associated with lower rates of non-marital <b>and</b> <b>teen</b> fertility. I next analyzed data from the National Survey of Family Growth and find that worsening macro-economic conditions at the national level raise the probability of contraceptive use, of consistent contraceptive use, and of the efficacy of the contraceptive method employed among unmarried women. The results suggest that disadvantaged women moderate fertility in response to severe economic shocks...|$|R
