5|$|The queen's foreign contemporaries {{strongly}} condemned her {{policies and}} viewed {{them as the}} actions of a tyrant or even a madwoman, a characterization that persisted in Western historical literature until the 1970s. Although Ranavalona has traditionally been depicted as a cruel and xenophobic tyrant, in more recent historical analyses she is commonly viewed as an astute politician who effectively protected the political and cultural sovereignty of her nation from European encroachment. In Madagascar today, the Malagasy of the central highlands hold complex and diverse views ranging across this spectrum. Most condemn her reign, in line with negative depictions of Ranavalona in current Malagasy history textbooks; this view is most common among Malagasy Christians. Others <b>admire</b> <b>her</b> effort to preserve Malagasy traditions and independence. The majority, regardless of their feelings toward her domestic policies, consider her a remarkable figure in Malagasy history and commend her strength as a ruler in a period of tension with European powers.|$|E
25|$|On 4 February 1905, Grand Duke Sergei, who had {{recently}} resigned from the post of Governor General of Moscow, was assassinated by Ivan Kalyaev, {{a member of the}} Socialist-Revolutionary Party. Kalyaev, armed with a homemade bomb, had aborted his first attempt to kill the Grand Duke when he spotted Dmitri and Marie with their uncle in his carriage. His uncle's death was only one of several assassinations that robbed Dmitri of close family members. After Sergei's death, Grand Duchess Elizabeth undertook to raise her niece and nephew on her own, thus making them part of a rare female-headed household. Maria Pavlovna continued to have some feelings of anger toward her aunt, whom she would blame for her overly hasty marriage to Prince William of Sweden in 1908, but Dmitri formed a very strong bond with Elizabeth and came to <b>admire</b> <b>her</b> personal fortitude.|$|E

500|$|In addition, unlike {{preceding}} traditional Disney animated feature films, {{the developing}} romantic relationship between Mulan and Li Shang {{is treated as}} more of a subplot as opposed to a traditional central plot, as observed by film critic Andy Klein of Animation World Network. Klein commented, [...] "Mulan isn't waiting for her prince to someday come; when he does arrive, having known her primarily as a man, and having learned to <b>admire</b> <b>her</b> for her deeper qualities, the romance is muted and subtle." [...] Throughout the movie they are constantly working towards helping each other change into better and truer versions of themselves in order to achieve their true potential.|$|E

[...] John Murphy from MusicOMH stated that Cyrus' performance at the MTV Video Music Awards became [...] "the seismic event that ensured we'd never recall 2013 without thinking of her", further opining that the anticipation it built for Bangerz made it [...] "impossible not to <b>admire</b> <b>her</b> PR operation." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{problems}} with her answer, {{she went on to}} win the competition and was crowned Binibining Pilipinas World. The criteria for judging the winner of the pageant allotted 80 percent to physical beauty, leaving just 20 percent to be divided evenly between personality and intelligence. Bediones later defended San Miguel, saying [...] "I <b>admire</b> <b>her</b> for not buckling under the pressure and for being as blatantly honest as possible". However, he also added, [...] "No matter how badly she may have performed in the Q, she couldn't have lost much considering she had a huge headstart in the scores". Winning the title made her the official designated Philippine delegate to the Miss World 2008 pageant, which was scheduled to be held later that year in Kiev, Ukraine (the venue was later moved to Johannesburg, South Africa due to the conflict between Georgia and Russia).|$|E

500|$|Five {{months after}} moving onto Coronation Street, Toyah {{developed}} {{a crush on}} her neighbour, Spider Nugent (Martin Hancock), and even turned vegetarian to try and impress him. Hancock told All About Soap's Hilary Kingsley that Spider initially saw Toyah as [...] "a chubby schoolgirl, a pesky brat who {{had a crush on}} him." [...] However, when she listened to his issues and helped him with his battles against the local supermarket and the council, Spider began to <b>admire</b> <b>her</b> instead. Hancock explained [...] "She was so efficient and hard-working that she became a friend. And then, over the summer, it hit him, [...] "Blimey! She's turned out nice!" [...] While Spider and Toyah watched the 1999 solar eclipse together, they ended up having sex for the first time. Hancock observed that both Spider and Toyah were overcome by the excitement to the point that there was [...] "an explosion of lust." [...] However, in the morning, Spider was torn about what had happened. He admired Toyah, but knew that if they became a couple, it would cause a lot of problems, particularly as there was a ten-year age gap between them.

2500|$|That {{is such a}} {{difficult}} question. There are times when certain people are blessed—and cursed—with an extraordinary gift, in which the gift is almost greater than the human being. Callas {{was one of these}} people. It was as if her own wishes, her life, her own happiness were all subservient to this incredible, incredible gift that she was given, this gift that reached out and taught us things about music that we knew very well, but showed us new things, things we never thought about, new possibilities. I think that is why singers <b>admire</b> <b>her</b> so. I think that's why conductors <b>admire</b> <b>her</b> so. I know it's why I <b>admire</b> <b>her</b> so. And she paid a tremendously difficult and expensive price for this career. I don't think she always understood what she did or why she did it. She usually had a tremendous effect on audiences and on people. But it was not something she could always live with gracefully or happily. I once said to her [...] "It must be a very enviable thing to be Maria Callas." [...] And she said, [...] "No, it's a very terrible thing to be Maria Callas, because it's a question of trying to understand something you can never really understand."

2500|$|In 1905, Onerva {{began to}} write short stories that {{eventually}} became parts of a novel. The novel was named , after its protagonist. Onerva was interested in symbolism and decadence and those influences {{can be seen in}} Mirdja. The novel embodies decadent narcissism: Mirdja admires her own beauty and longs for a man to <b>admire</b> <b>her</b> as well. Mirdja encounters problems trying to reconcile the individuality of an independent woman with love. Mirdja experiments with several female roles and ways to love. Her experimentation and relationships, however, turn out unsuccessful. Mirdja parallels many aspects of Onerva's life: Mirdja marries Runar and Onerva marries Väinö Streng, and both Mirdja and Onerva notice that married life does not meet their expectations. Furthermore, Mirdja features the character Rolf Tanne, who has been speculated to be based on Eino Leino. Mirdja was published in 1908 and, initially, it caused a lot of reprehension Mirdjas content advocating for erotic freedom and its contempt for traditional family values attracted frown from, for instance, some women. The novel was positively received by young intellectuals, who liked its depiction of the thoughts and emotions of an independent-minded woman. Mirdja earned Onerva the 1908 State Literature Prize with 1,000 Finnish marks worth of prize money. Conferring the prize on Onerva incited opposition, and the [...] magazine published a womens' objection in response to the nomination. Onerva utilized her own life experiences also in a novel published in 1913 called Inari. In it, Inari is a woman whose love wavers between two men, the artist Porkka and the pianist Alvia. The men are based on Eino Leino and Leevi Madetoja. Onerva made the admission that Inari's love life and fate were based on hers.|$|E
