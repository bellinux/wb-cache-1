5|$|By 1886 {{the four}} threequarter system had spread {{throughout}} Wales. First instituted by Cardiff RFC in 1884, {{the system was}} designed to allow Cardiff centres Frank Hancock and Tom Williams {{to play at the}} same time, and involved dropping the ninth forward to include a second centre. Newport were reluctant to <b>adopt</b> <b>this</b> style of play, mainly due to Gould's excellent kicking and covering abilities, which allowed the club to continue with the advantage of the extra forward.|$|E
5|$|Caddisflies {{are best}} known for the {{portable}} cases created by their larvae. About thirty families of caddisfly, members of the suborder Integripalpia, <b>adopt</b> <b>this</b> stratagem. These larvae eat detritus, largely decaying vegetable material, and the dead leaf fragments on which they feed tend to accumulate in hollows, in slow-moving sections of streams and behind stones and tree roots. The cases provide protection to the larvae as they make their way between these resources.|$|E

5|$|In 1760, Maria Theresa {{created the}} council of state, {{composed}} of the state chancellor, {{three members of the}} high nobility and three knights, which served as a committee of experienced people who advised her. The council of state lacked executive or legislative authority, but nevertheless showed the difference between the form of government employed by Frederick II of Prussia. Unlike the latter, Maria Theresa was not an autocrat who acted as her own minister. Prussia would <b>adopt</b> <b>this</b> form of government only after 1807.|$|E

5|$|The arrow-head {{design of}} the castle's bastion {{reflected}} new ideas about defensive fortifications spreading out from Italy in the 16th century. Earlier Henrician castles had used the older European style of semi-circular bastions to avoid presenting any weak spots in the stonework, but an arrow-headed design enabled defenders to provide much more effective supporting fire against an attacking force. Yarmouth {{was among the first}} fortifications in Europe, and the first in England, to <b>adopt</b> <b>this</b> design.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternate}} route for developing emergency medicine {{is to provide}} additional training for other specialists to equip them to practice in emergency medicine. This has the benefit of being more rapid to implement, as physicians already trained in other areas can add the necessary emergency skills to their repertoire. However, after the initial expansion {{it is difficult for}} emergency medicine to progress further in nations that <b>adopt</b> <b>this</b> strategy, as the retrained practitioners identify more with their original specialty and have less incentive to continue to press for further innovations in emergency medicine.|$|E
5|$|During {{the baby}} boom, DeLee's {{prophylactic}} forceps approach found new life. Busy physicians were often eager to <b>adopt</b> <b>this</b> systematic approach to anesthetized delivery because its efficiency {{allowed them to}} care for more patients. By 1968, nearly 40% of the babies born in U.S. hospitals were delivered with forceps. The use of episiotomies also continued to increase throughout DeLee's career and after his death. By the 1970s, 90% of delivering women received an episiotomy. A 1983 study did not support good outcomes with this practice, and by the year 2000, only 20 percent of U.S. deliveries involved an episiotomy.|$|E
5|$|In 1899 Madge met {{her future}} husband Edgar Syers, a figure skater and coach who was 18 years her senior. Edgar was an {{exponent}} of the international skating style, which was freer and less rigid than the traditional English style, and encouraged Madge to <b>adopt</b> <b>this</b> style. Madge and Edgar completed together in pairs skating events, and in 1900 finished second {{in one of the}} first international pairs events, staged in Berlin. They married in June of that year. The Syers co-authored The Book of Winter Sports in 1908.|$|E

When she learns that her neighbor, Brian (Nate Corddry), will not be bribed out of his apartment, she agrees to move in with him, seemingly to save money, hoping to drive him out with her behavior. At work, Liz is disgusted by her staff writer, Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) peeing in bottles to stop global warming. However, she decides to <b>adopt</b> <b>this</b> behavior to force Brian to leave; she is successful.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1912 naval law was passed, Britain and Germany {{attempted}} {{to reach a}} compromise with the Haldane Mission, led by the British War Minister Richard Haldane. The arms reduction mission ended in failure, however, and the 1912 law was announced shortly thereafter. The Germans were aware at as early as 1911, the Royal Navy had abandoned {{the idea of a}} decisive battle with the German fleet, in favor of a distant blockade at the entrances to the North Sea, which the British could easily control due to their geographical position. There emerged the distinct possibility that the German fleet would be unable to force a battle on its own terms, which would render it militarily useless. When the war came in 1914, the British did in fact <b>adopt</b> <b>this</b> strategy. Coupled with the restrictive orders of the Kaiser, who preferred to keep the fleet intact {{to be used as a}} bargaining chip in the peace settlements, the ability of the High Seas Fleet to affect the military situation was markedly reduced.|$|E

25|$|Although Frederick William I {{was raised}} a Calvinist, he feared {{he was not}} of the elect. To avoid the {{possibility}} of Frederick being motivated by the same concerns, the king ordered that his heir not be taught about predestination. Nevertheless, although Frederick was largely irreligious, he to some extent appeared to <b>adopt</b> <b>this</b> tenet of Calvinism. Some scholars have speculated that he did this to spite his father.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{being used}} in several publications, such as the grammar of Romani {{compiled}} by Gheorghe Sarău and the Polish publication Informaciaqo lil, the IRU standard has yet to find a broad base of support from Romani writers.
