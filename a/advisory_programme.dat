40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse how {{participants}} learn in small business <b>advisory</b> <b>programmes</b> and to explore the impact of these learning programmes on the development of reflective learning dispositions in participants. The research involves two case studies of small business <b>advisory</b> <b>programmes</b> in Queensland, a state of Australia. One involves training in the use of GPS/GIS technology amongst rural SMEs and the other seeks to develop improved management and operational capabilities in regional and metropolitan manufacturing SMEs. Face to face semi-structured interviews were conducted throughout rural, regional and metropolitan Queensland with participants, trainers and senior executives in the administering organisations that ran the programmes. Learning in these programmes occurs through a combination of interaction with others and the adoption of practice-based and learner-centred processes. The impact of the programmes on participants includes the development of reflective learning dispositions, improved confidence in learning and appreciation of the value of new knowledge to their business. The research suggests that small business training programmes have the potential to affect the development of critical reflective learning dispositions in participants which is of fundamental importance to the development of a learning or knowledge economy...|$|R

50|$|Australia has had {{national}} standards for organic and biodynamic products in place since 1992, and like New Zealand, {{it is on the}} third country list of the European Union. It is expected that the Australian Standard, based on the National Standard employed since the early 1990s for the export market, will be adopted in 2009. In New Zealand, a National Organic Standard was launched in 2003. There is little government support to encourage organic agriculture in Australia. However, over the recent past, governments have been supportive of the Australian Standards issue. Furthermore, funding is made available to promote an understanding among consumers. In New Zealand, through the establishment of the sector umbrella organization Organics Aotearoa New Zealand and the Organic <b>Advisory</b> <b>Programme</b> as well as other initiatives, there is political recognition of the benefits oforganic agriculture.|$|E

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to foster a better {{understanding}} of how decision-making processes work in sport clubs and to develop appropriate advisory concepts or management tools in order to successfully realize structural changes in sport clubs. This paper examines the decision-making processes associated with an external <b>advisory</b> <b>programme.</b> Based on the assumption of bounded rationality, the garbage can model is used to grasp these decision-making processes theoretically and to access them empirically. Design/methodology/approach Based on a case study framework, an in-depth analysis of the decision-making and implementation processes involved in an <b>advisory</b> <b>programme</b> was performed in ten selected football clubs. Guided interviews were conducted on the basis of the four streams of the garbage can model. The interviews were analysed with qualitative content analysis. Findings Results show that three types of club can be distinguished in terms of their implementation processes: low implementation of the external input; partial implementation of the external input; and rigorous implementation of the external input. In addition, the analysis shows that the participants in the <b>advisory</b> <b>programme</b> are the key actors in both the decision-making process and the implementation. Originality/value The paper provides insights into the practicability of advisory programmes for sport clubs and the transfer to the clubs’ practical decision-making routines. Additionally, it shows how sport clubs deal with (external) advisory impulses, and which different decision-making practices underlie these processes...|$|E

40|$|China’s {{economic}} and social achievements {{since the beginning of}} reform and opening are unprecedented in global history. Managing the growth process in this continuously changing environment has required great skill and the use of unconventional economic policy. Now China has entered a new era in its development process with a set of challenges largely {{different from those of the}} recent past. Some problems - such as growing internal and external structural imbalances, increasing income and regional inequality – have arisen from, or been exacerbated by, the very pattern and success of high growth since reforms began. Others are newly posed by rapid changes in the global economy. These challenges can best be tackled in an integrated and coordinated fashion. This report, supported by the China Economic Research and <b>Advisory</b> <b>Programme</b> (CERAP), identifies the primary challenges facing China today and presents options for meeting them.

40|$|An {{estimate}} {{is made of}} the benefits resulting from {{the implementation of a}} proposed fungicide <b>advisory</b> <b>programme</b> for Kent wheat farmers. The programme has a value by providing information which enables improved spraying decisions to be made by farmers. The expected annual value for Kent is found to be £ 106, 000. A closer examination is made of both the returns and costs of one component of the scheme, viz, the training of farmers to recognise the disease (caused by Septoria spp.) in their fields. An average benefit/cost ratio of 8 / 1 is calculated to result from the provision of farmer training programmes. However, if the decision by farmers to attend courses is made upon the criteria of expected gain to themselves, then initial courses would have a much higher benefit/cost ratio. There would be diminishing returns to additional courses, but only those Kentish wheat growers with the smallest areas of crop would lack the financial incentive to attend. Copyrigh...|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{implementation}} of the Social Amelioration Programme (SAP) of the sugar industry in the Philippines. This programme endeavours to ensure the participation of both the sugar employers and workers sector representatives, along with the government sector, in the established government-sponsored tripartite councils (the DTCs) as regards decision and policy-making on the effective implementation of SAP. The SAP is a production sharing scheme instituted in the Philippine sugar industry pursuant to R. A. 6982, intended to supplement the inadequate income of sugar workers and to finance socio-economic programmes to improve their livelihood and well-being. The distribution of cash bonuses to covered workers is an important element of the programme. The other aspects of the new SAP are the enforcement of R. A. 809, the death benefit programme, maternity benefit programme, and the livelihood and income-generating projects financed by funds derived from related liens and interest earnings thereof. The so-called tripartite <b>advisory</b> <b>programme</b> which ensures the participation of the employer and worker sector representatives in the DTCs, along with the government sector, are also part of the new SAP. These programmes are implemented by the BRW-DOLE (Bureau of Rural Workers - Department of Labour and Employment) {{with the assistance of the}} DOLE Regional Offices. The sugar industry has been present in the Philippines since the turn of the century, and to the present day has been characterized by periods of growth, dependency, turbulence and uncertainties in terms of employment, production, land area utilization and the market, both domestic and foreign. Several factors may further affect the overall viability of the industry such as the unfair pricing of sugar in the world market and indiscriminate liberalization as a result of the forthcoming GATT, inadequate rural infrastructure, imposition of additional taxes on milling facilities and the value-added tax, uncertainties associated with {{the implementation of}} CARP, unpredictable drought or calamities, diversification programme and government support in terms of research and development. To evaluate the effectiveness of the new SAP and the tripartite <b>advisory</b> <b>programme,</b> two principal sources of information were utilized; status reports prepared by BRW-DOLE and the results of two surveys of representatives from the government, employer and worker sector, members of the DTCs, vested with responsibilities for decision and policy-making on the effective implementation of such programmes. The results of the first survey indicated a positive assessment. The assessment of the employer and worker sector representatives in the past 3 years (1991 – 1993). was generally positive The assessment of the efficiency and effectiveness of their DTCs was also positive. In the second survey, the results also indicated a positive assessment of the performance and effectiveness of the DTC in mooting its functions and responsibilities pursuant to R. A. 6982. This thesis concludes with a number of recommended changes that might be made in dealing with issues and problems relating to the effective implementation of SAP...|$|E
