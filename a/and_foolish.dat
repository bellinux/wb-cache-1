5|$|The rare amity {{established}} {{between the two}} states would not last; the death of Mehmed I {{and the rise of}} Murad II in 1421 coupled with the ascent of John VIII to the Byzantine throne led to a deteriorated change in relations between the two. Neither leader was content with the status quo. John VIII made the first <b>and</b> <b>foolish</b> move by inciting a rebellion in the Ottoman Empire: a certain Mustafa had been released by the Byzantines and claimed that he was Bayezid's lost son.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} {{has a long}} history of {{interaction}} with humanity; depictions of the species exist from the Upper Paleolithic period, with carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves. The species has a largely negative reputation in both Western culture and African folklore. In the former, the species is mostly regarded as ugly and cowardly, while in the latter, it is viewed as greedy, gluttonous, stupid, <b>and</b> <b>foolish,</b> yet powerful and potentially dangerous. The majority of Western perceptions on the species can be found in the writings of Aristotle and Pliny the Elder, though in relatively unjudgemental form. Explicit, negative judgements occur in the Physiologus, where the animal is depicted as a hermaphrodite and grave robber. The IUCN's hyena specialist group identifies the spotted hyena's negative reputation as detrimental to the species' continued survival, both in captivity and the wild.|$|E
25|$|Historically, Fulgentius’s {{work has}} been criticized as being bombastic <b>and</b> <b>foolish.</b> His Latin prose is obscure and often corrupt, making it {{difficult}} to decipher his meaning. He is known for unnecessarily long and wordy prose and highly obscure allusions.|$|E

25|$|Of {{the thirty}} or so parables in the {{canonical}} Gospels, {{this was one}} of the four that were shown in medieval art almost to the exclusion of the others, but not mixed in with the narrative scenes of the Life of Christ (the others were the Wise <b>and</b> <b>Foolish</b> Virgins, Dives and Lazarus, and the Good Samaritan. The Labourers in the Vineyard also appears in Early Medieval works).|$|E

Ronald Welch in Knight Crusader and Jean Plaidy (Eleanor Hibbert) in The Heart of the Lion both depict him sympathetically as likable and chivalrous. Both give the misleading impression that he was younger than King Richard: he was at least several years older.|$|E

25|$|A third grand {{attempt was}} made in 1653 {{under the command of}} Shah Jahan's oldest and {{favorite}} son Dara Shikoh, a deadly rival of Aurangzeb, and again Jai Singh was sent with this army. Prince Dara was knowledgeable in spiritual matters and was refreshingly secular in his outlook, but these noble qualities were marred by his military incompetence and his flattering <b>and</b> <b>foolish</b> advisers. Dara was particularly harsh on officers that had taken part in the earlier campaigns under Aurangzeb and repeatedly taunted Jai Singh for those failures. But when his own campaign ended with the same result, the Mughals finally gave up all attempts to recover Kandahar.|$|E
25|$|After his death, Trollope's Autobiography {{appeared}} {{and was a}} best-seller in London. Trollope's downfall {{in the eyes of}} the critics stemmed largely from this volume. Even during his writing career, reviewers tended increasingly to shake their heads over his prodigious output, but when Trollope revealed that he strictly adhered to a daily writing quota, he confirmed his critics' worst fears. The Muse, in their view, might prove immensely prolific, but she would never ever follow a schedule. Furthermore, Trollope admitted that he wrote for money; at the same time he called the disdain of money false <b>and</b> <b>foolish.</b> The Muse, claimed the critics, should not be aware of money.|$|E

25|$|Somehow {{influenced}} by the scientific theories of 19th century, but most certainly {{by the idea of}} human progress, Victor Hugo wrote in The Legend of the Centuries (1859) a long poem in two parts that can be viewed like a dystopia/utopia fiction, called 20th century. It shows in a first scene the body of a broken huge ship, the greatest product of the prideful <b>and</b> <b>foolish</b> mankind that called it Leviathan, wandering in a desert world where the winds blow and the anger of the wounded Nature is; humanity, finally reunited and pacified, has gone toward the stars in a starship, to look for and to bring liberty into the light.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, the U.S. {{government}} uncovered {{an attempt}} to form a cartel in the heavy electric equipment industry. It charged 13 companies, including {{the largest in the}} industry (Westinghouse, General Electric, and Allis-Chalmers), with price fixing and bid rigging. Most feigned innocence, but Allis-Chalmers pleaded guilty. Although one motive for the forming of cartels is so that amply profitable firms can try to become obscenely profitable, it did not apply in this instance, according to Buescher; rather, his view of the attempt at a heavy-electrical cartel was that it was a desperate (<b>and</b> <b>foolish)</b> attempt to turn red ink to black ink among fierce competition.|$|E
25|$|One {{response}} is {{that humans are}} not necessarily confined to Earth, and could use it and move on. A counter-argument is that {{only a tiny fraction}} of humans could do this—and they would be self-selected by ability to do technological escalation on others (for instance, the ability to create large spacecraft to flee the planet in, and simultaneously fend off others who seek to prevent them). Another counter-argument is that extraterrestrial life would encounter the fleeing humans and destroy them as a locust species. A third is that if there are no other worlds fit to support life (and no extraterrestrials who compete with humans to occupy them) it is both futile to flee, <b>and</b> <b>foolish</b> to imagine that it would take less energy and skill to protect the Earth as a habitat than it would take to construct some new habitat.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the meeting}} in Cologne, Papen and Hitler had been photographed going into Schröder's house {{and the next day}} 5 January 1933 the news of the Hitler-Papen summit was front-page news all over Germany. Schleicher did not regard the Papen-Hitler talks as a threat, {{regarding}} Papen as a silly <b>and</b> <b>foolish</b> man unable to accomplish anything. On 9 January 1933, Papen met with Hindenburg to tell him that he believed that Hitler was now willing to support a presidential government headed by himself. That same day, Papen met with Schleicher to tell him that he had only been seeking to have Hitler support his government at the Cologne meeting, and furthermore he had was not angry about being ousted by him or Schleicher's attacks on him in public. Based on what Papen had told him, Schleicher now believed Hitler was now only seeking to be the defense or interior minister in his government. To continue the talks which started in Cologne, it was decided that henceforth that Papen and Hitler would meet at the house of Joachim von Ribbentrop in Berlin as Ribbentrop was a Nazi who was also an old friend of Papen's going back to their service together in the Ottoman Empire in 1917-18.|$|E
25|$|This {{sophisticated}} form of hazing {{was played}} out {{each year in}} September. This elaborate hoax often gained the cooperation of faculty members {{and people in the}} town. During Freshman Week, the first-year students were informed about several student romances on campus through planned gossip. The story went that there was one ardent couple who were constantly together when not in class, but the girl had another upperclassman admirer. The couple argued over the love triangle and it ended in the girl walking off with her new boy. After that, there were public acts that involved the two boys fighting. The affair was all anyone would talk about. Then on a certain pre-arranged night, all freshmen were ordered to stay in their rooms by student governing bodies. At 10 pm, a drunk ex-boyfriend appeared at the men's dorm. He brandished a gun and staggered through the halls in search of his rival. He finally found him in one of the public archways of the building. Soon, several shots rang out and the victim fell to the floor with blood (ketchup) flowing from his mouth. Other upperclassmen took charge, sending confused and panicked freshmen in pursuit of the killer or for a doctor. A town physician would appear and call for an ambulance, only adding to the theatrics of the evening. Most other freshmen were rounded up and sent in groups to nearby hospitals to offer their blood for transfusion, but were left stranded. At the same time, the freshmen girls witnessed the girl in the triangle see the unconscious victim being taken away and go into a fit of hysterics. During the 1930s, a member of the staff was a Justice of the Peace. He presided over a fake hearing in a large classroom where freshman girls tearfully testified to what they thought they saw happen on campus that night. It was during that hearing that the truth was revealed when the three main actors walked into the room, arm in arm. The next day, the freshmen felt young <b>and</b> <b>foolish,</b> but were looking forward to the next year when they were able to play the same prank on new freshmen. The tradition died in 1946, when its last performance narrowly escaped tragedy when some ex-servicemen studying at LVC under the G.I. Bill threatened {{to take care of the}} villain causing trouble between the lovers.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} state Christian doctrine {{was determined by}} the first seven ecumenical councils, and it was then the emperor's duty to impose it to his subjects.

500|$|The {{butterfly}} style - used by most {{all modern}} goaltenders - {{was invented by}} Glenn Hall. [...] Considered both unique <b>and</b> <b>foolish,</b> Hall's style of dropping {{to his knees and}} kicking his pads out in a V formation forced shooters to aim for {{the top half of the}} net. Hall adopted the technique as a youth when he lacked the arm strength to stop shots with his stick. An eight-time All-Star, Hall became an NHL regular at the start of the 1955–1956 season to begin a sequence of 502 consecutive games as goaltender for Detroit and Chicago. This record is hailed as one of the NHL's most unbreakable.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{imperial}} decrees and the stringent {{stance of}} the state church itself, which {{came to be known}} as the Eastern Orthodox Church or Eastern Christianity, the latter never represented all Christians in Byzantium. Mango believes that, in the early stages of the Empire, the [...] "mad <b>and</b> <b>foolish</b> persons", those labelled [...] "heretics" [...] by the state church, were the majority of the population. Besides the pagans, who existed until the end of the 6th century, and the Jews, there were many followers– sometimes even emperors– of various Christian doctrines, such as Nestorianism, Monophysitism, Arianism, and Paulicianism, whose teachings were in some opposition to the main theological doctrine, as determined by the Ecumenical Councils.|$|E
