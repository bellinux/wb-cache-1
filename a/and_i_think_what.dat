"The thing is, I always saw Madonna as a {{performance}} artist. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> I wanted to portray was the process {{about how a}} performer arrives at their work. And the thing is, what she had talked about as well, is that before a concert, what she finds very interesting is the rehearsals and the straining and maybe {{she would like to}} injure. [...] And she said that the process of making the concert became more intriguing than the final result." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} {{influence}} that the apparent death of Steve Rogers has on Carter, Atwell explained that [...] "It's only been a year and she's grieving him <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> keeps her going is he was the greatest person she ever knew ... she's also determined {{to make sure that}} his work wasn't in vain." [...] Following the first season, Atwell noted that Carter did not [...] "win everyone’s respect", with Jack Thompson taking credit for her actions, for example, but [...] "she knows her value so she doesn’t need that praise". For the second season, executive producer Michele Fazekas explained that after Carter [...] "put a lot of things emotionally to bed", such as letting go of Captain America, she is now [...] "more open to looking at her life and figuring out, does she want a relationship?" [...] Fazekas added that Carter would start to realize that [...] "not everybody has her ideals", even in the SSR.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked what}} sets Gravity {{apart from his}} {{previous}} releases, Lecrae stated that [...] "Obviously, there's more risk involved in terms of just making more mature music that's not as straight [...] explicit. it's dealing with bigger issues. People may have to think a little bit more. The production is a lot bigger and more advanced than it's been. Lyrically, as an artist, I think I've written {{some of the best}} lyrics I've ever written." [...] Lecrae provided insight into the album's concept during an interview with Family Christian, stating that [...] "Gravity is loosely based on Ecclesiastes <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> Solomon was trying to do was bring some weight to life and that’s really what I want to do, to paint some sober pictures." [...] He described that [...] "there’s a sober picture of how it’s only {{for a short period of}} time, it’s short-lived, or that we still have Jesus. So that’s what I would call a weighty part, a gravitational pull to remind us of who we are in Jesus." [...] Billboard stated that Lecrae increased his level of production for Gravity and [...] "mixed reggae and soul influences with his signature brash sound." [...] AllHipHop described the album as opening with [...] "an influx of instruments like violin, drums, guitars". [...] "I Know" [...] was described as having one of the hardest beats on the album, while [...] "Mayday" [...] was considered one of the most [...] "organic" [...] sounding tracks. [...] "Violence" [...] was considered one of the most energetic tracks, and was described as [...] "caribbean-esque" [...] with a dancehall vibe. After the music video for [...] "Lord Have Mercy" [...] was released, an article in The Christian Post article compared the song to the Kanye West single [...] "Mercy", both in its title and musical style. The article elaborated that [...] "like Kanye West's song, [...] "'Lord Have Mercy' features slowed down sampled vocals for its chorus along with heavy bass and an overall dark tone." [...] It noted the appearance of No Malice in the video, stating that [...] "the chorus seems to sample his voice." ...|$|E

It's mine and it's yours. And everybody in between, they're the distributors. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{that something like}} a music channel can be very powerful. Sometimes they think they're the ones who decide <b>what's</b> heard. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's a dangerous situation. <b>And,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>what's</b> more dangerous is that they think it belongs to them. That's probably what [...] "Not for You" [...] is about.|$|R

2500|$|National {{media outlets}} {{reported}} on an exchange between judge Harry Connick Jr. and contestant Quentin Alexander noting the incident of Connick scolding a contestant was awkward. On the live airing of the Top 6 show, there was three contestants {{who had not}} been saved when Alexander was chosen. After he performed, host Ryan Seacrest noted that he appeared to be upset. When asked Alexander responded [...] "This sucks, We've got two of the best vocalists, my best friend [...] sitting over there. This whole thing is whack, but I'm going to shut up right now." [...] Seacrest then replied saying that this is a competition, and with the save anything could happen. When Alexander had left the stage, Connick Jr. said, [...] "Quentin, if it's that whack, then you can always go home, because Idol is paying {{a lot of money to}} give you this experience and for you to say that to this hand that is feeding you right now, I think is highly disrespectful." [...] Alexander was then prompted by the producers to return to the stage where he approached the judges and clarified he meant the two being potentially eliminated was whack, not the show, or the experience. Later, after performing his second song, he explained [...] "I understand that these things are going to happen, and I just didn't want my friend to leave" [...] and apologized. Judge Jennifer Lopez empathized with Alexander's emotions running high but said that as an artist he had to learn to work through that even when it happens to put on the performance. Joey Cook commented after being eliminated on Alexander's statements: I pretty much just told him what he did was beautiful, in my opinion, and it was the perfect representation of him. Quentin is a very emotional person. He’s very 'all cards on the table.' There is no sugar coating. He doesn’t hide his emotions. He’s honest. He’s a raw human being, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>what</b> happened last night was the perfect example of that and how emotional of a person he is.|$|E

Besides, the subject is a distressing one to him, and it is seldom he can be induced to speak about it. Perhaps that is a pity; I find it does not always save one trouble in the end to avoid a little immediate pain." ...|$|E

His voice, in everything, came from this vision, and maybe that is why it embraced a wider than usual range of idioms and contrasts, including popular elements.' ...|$|E
