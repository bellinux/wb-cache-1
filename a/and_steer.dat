5|$|In this {{idealized}} and linearized model, {{there are}} many geometric parameters (wheelbase, head angle, mass of each body, wheel radius, etc.), but only four significant variables: lean angle, lean rate, steer angle, <b>and</b> <b>steer</b> rate. These equations have been verified by comparison with multiple numeric models derived completely independently.|$|E
5|$|Adding {{complexity}} to the model, such as rider movement, suspension movement, tire compliance, or frame flex, adds {{degrees of}} freedom. While the rear frame does pitch with leaning and steering, the pitch angle is completely {{constrained by the}} requirement for both wheels {{to remain on the}} ground, and so can be calculated geometrically from the other seven variables. If the location of the bike and the rotation of the wheels are ignored, the first five degrees of freedom can also be ignored, and the bike can be described by just two variables: lean angle <b>and</b> <b>steer</b> angle.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} Zeranol and {{castration}} on organoleptic and mechanically assessed tenderness were studied using the 193 young beef cattle {{described in the}} companion paper (Impact of castration and zeranol implants on bullocks: I. Behavior, growth and carcass traits). Sensory panel evaluations showed that steaks from control <b>and</b> implanted <b>steer</b> carcasses had higher mean scores for tenderness, juiciness, flavor and overall palatability than those from control and implanted bulls. Implanting did not influence juiciness or flavor within the bull or steer groups, but control bulls <b>and</b> <b>steers</b> were significantly (P<. 005) more tender and more palatable overall than were implanted bulls <b>and</b> <b>steers.</b> When comparing the mechanical measurements there was considerable variation among the instruments. The Armour tenderometer ranked meat from the implanted steers significantly tougher than either the control or implanted bulls. The Warner-Bratzler shear, Krammer shear and Instron Press ranked steaks from steers significantly more tender than those from bulls. Implanted and control groups of animals were similar in tenderness when judged by the mechanical measurements. Behavior and palatability characteristics of implanted and control bulls <b>and</b> <b>steers</b> were also studied. Implantation made bulls <b>and</b> <b>steers</b> more docile. The libido measurements were also lower for the implanted bulls <b>and</b> <b>steers.</b> Within group of implanted bulls <b>and</b> <b>steers</b> those that were least aggressive {{tended to be more}} tender than their more aggressive counterparts...|$|R

5|$|The {{amount of}} trail a {{particular}} bike has may vary with time for several reasons. On bikes with front suspension, especially telescopic forks, compressing the front suspension, due to heavy braking for example, can steepen the steering axis angle and reduce trail. Trail also varies with lean angle, and steering angle, usually decreasing from a maximum when the bike is straight upright and steered straight ahead. Trail can decrease to zero with sufficiently large lean <b>and</b> <b>steer</b> angles, which can alter how stable a bike feels. Finally, even {{the profile of}} the front tire can influence how trail varies as the bike is leaned and steered.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} strong leaders {{who could take}} charge <b>and</b> <b>steer</b> America out of its crisis is seen in Gabriel Over the White House (1933), about a benevolent {{dictator}} who takes control of the United States. Walter Huston stars as a weak-willed, ineffectual president (likely modeled after Hoover) who is inhabited by the archangel Gabriel upon being knocked unconscious. The spirit's behavior {{is similar to that}} of Abraham Lincoln. The president solves the nation's unemployment crisis and executes an Al Capone-type criminal who has continually flouted the law.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of 23 February, Willaumez sent the {{dispatch}} schooner Magpye into Lorient with instructions for Troude to sail when possible <b>and</b> <b>steer</b> for the Pertuis d'Antioche near Rochefort, where the fleet was due to assemble. Willaumez then took his fleet southwards, followed from 09:00 by Beresford's squadron. The French fleet passed between Belle Île and Quiberon and then around Île d'Yeu, passing the Phares des Baleines on Île de Ré at 22:30. There the fleet was sighted by frigate HMS Amethyst under Captain Michael Seymour, the scout for the Rochefort blockade squadron of HMS Caesar, HMS Defiance and HMS Donegal under Rear-Admiral Robert Stopford, which was anchored off the Phare de Chassiron on Ile d'Oléron. Signal rockets from Amethyst alerted Stopford to Willaumez's presence and Stopford closed with Willaumez during the night but was {{not strong enough to}} oppose his entry into the Basque Roads {{at the mouth of the}} Charente River on the morning of 24 February.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} to calculate eigenvalues, {{one for each of}} the four state variables (lean angle, lean rate, steer angle, <b>and</b> <b>steer</b> rate), from the linearized equations in order to analyze the normal modes and self-stability of a particular bike design. In the plot to the right, eigenvalues of one particular bicycle are calculated for forward speeds of 0–10m/s (22mph). When the real parts of all eigenvalues (shown in dark blue) are negative, the bike is self-stable. When the imaginary parts of any eigenvalues (shown in cyan) are non-zero, the bike exhibits oscillation. The eigenvalues are point symmetric about the origin and so any bike design with a self-stable region in forward speeds will not be self-stable going backwards at the same speed.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 5,000 RAF airmen {{prepared}} {{to take part in}} 817 heavy bombers which were fueled and armed in the evening. A trigger plan was prepared, which would act as a feint but, this night, Bomber Command amended the feint which was partially compromised by weather conditions. Restrictions on the flight path of the bombers was also changed. Bomber streams were permitted to fly over Ingoldmells Point to Filey; but not over coastal areas where no ground defences were stationed. The route took them downstream to southern England by Reading, and across the English Channel, as the trigger plan required. However, they were then ordered to turn back toward the North Sea. The reason behind this was the low-lying cloud which was ever-present over the continent that night. The clouds made it difficult for pilots to see <b>and</b> <b>steer</b> clear of zones heavily guarded by Allied ground defences near to the frontline. The possibility of losing aircraft to Friendly fire was too great.|$|E
5|$|Tank is an arcade game {{developed}} by Kee Games, {{a subsidiary of}} Atari, and released in November 1974. It was the only original title not based on an existing Atari property {{developed by}} Kee Games, which was founded to sell clones of Atari games to distributors as a fake competitor prior to the merger of the two companies. In the game, two players drive tanks through a maze viewed from above while attempting to shoot each other and avoid mines, represented by X marks, in a central minefield. Each player controls their tank {{with a pair of}} joysticks, moving them forwards and back to drive, reverse, <b>and</b> <b>steer,</b> and firing shells with a button to attempt to destroy the other tank. The destruction of a tank from a mine or shell earns the opposing player a point, and tanks reappear after being destroyed. The winner is the player with more points when time runs out, with each game typically one or two minutes long.|$|E

5|$|Originally, the {{developers}} planned to only upgrade the graphics and tweak the gameplay. However, as development was {{getting closer to}} completion, Capcom started making more substantial changes in the game. For example, the inventory was expanded so that players could carry a standard item like Jill's lock picking, while defense items, which were initially {{not going to be}} separated from the main inventory, were introduced to make the game a bit easier than the original Resident Evil. The developers originally planned to make all enemies invisible but the idea was ultimately discarded because it would have made the remake very different from the original game. However, they designed the zombies so that they could come back to life {{a certain amount of time}} after they are killed. The developers also added new areas for the player to explore, changed most of the puzzle designs, and included a new control scheme called Type C where players move their characters by pressing the R button of the GameCube controller <b>and</b> <b>steer</b> them with the analog stick. Another addition is the subplot involving the character Lisa Trevor, which was cut from the original game. Instead of using adjectives to describe difficulty levels, Mikami deliberately decided to have unique questions so that the player would pick the hard one.|$|E
5|$|While {{the initial}} steer torque <b>and</b> <b>steer</b> angle are both {{opposite}} the desired turn direction, {{this may not}} be the case to maintain a steady-state turn. The sustained steer angle is usually in the same direction as the turn, but may remain opposite to the direction of the turn, especially at high speeds. The sustained steer torque required to maintain that steer angle is usually opposite the turn direction. The actual magnitude and orientation of both the sustained steer angle and sustained steer torque of a particular bike in a particular turn depend on forward speed, bike geometry, tire properties, and combined bike and rider mass distribution. Once in a turn, the radius can only be changed with an appropriate change in lean angle, and this can be accomplished by additional countersteering out of the turn to increase lean and decrease radius, then into the turn to decrease lean and increase radius. To exit the turn, the bike must again countersteer, momentarily steering more into the turn in order to decrease the radius, thus increasing inertial forces, and thereby decreasing the angle of lean.|$|E

40|$|In New Zealand, {{there is}} an {{increasing}} influence of dairy breeds {{in the production of}} beef. First-cross beef-cross-dairy cows have shown potential as beef breeding cows due to their greater milk yield than straight-bred beef cows. There have been few studies examining the finishing characteristics of the progeny of such cows. The objectives of this study were to investigate the effect of breed-cross on growth, carcass characteristics and meat quality attributes for progeny of beef and beef-cross-dairy cows grown in a New Zealand pastoral production system. This study also aimed to determine if there were differences in breed effects between heifers <b>and</b> <b>steers.</b> Growth, carcass characteristics and the meat quality were assessed for <b>steers</b> <b>and</b> heifers from beef and beef-cross-dairy cows. Heifers (n= 53) <b>and</b> <b>steers</b> (n= 50) were born to Angus (AA), Angus-cross-Friesian (AF), Angus-cross- KiwiCross (AK) and Angus-cross-Jersey (AJ) cows and sired by Charolais (C) bulls. Heifers <b>and</b> <b>steers</b> were grazed on pasture until slaughter at 574 and 784 days of age respectively. Live animal measurements were considered separately for heifers <b>and</b> <b>steers.</b> Carcass characteristics <b>and</b> meat quality attributes were compared among breed-crosses and between heifers <b>and</b> <b>steers.</b> The C-AA heifers (226. 8 ± 4. 7 kg) <b>and</b> <b>steers</b> (238. 8 ± 4. 6 kg) were lighter at weaning than the beef-cross-dairy breed heifers (C-AJ = 239. 9 ± 4. 6 kg, C-AK = 254. 7 ± 6. 3 kg, C-AF = 258. 9 ± 5. 7 kg) <b>and</b> <b>steers</b> (C-AJ = 256. 1 ± 4. 9 kg, C-AK = 257. 0 ± 7. 2 kg, C-AF = 267. 0 ± 5. 7 kg) (P 0. 05). The C-AA (53. 1 ± 0. 3 %) steers had a greater dressing-out percentage than C-AF (51. 9 ± 0. 4 %) and C-AJ (51. 5 ± 0. 3 %) steers (P 0. 05). Steers were longer, heavier, had a greater fat depth C and greater proportion of intramuscular fat than heifers (P 0. 05), except that C-AJ cattle had yellower fat than C-AA, and C-AA and C-AF cattle had redder fat than C-AK. There was no interaction of breed-cross with sex effects. Therefore, the C-AA cattle were more suited to a finishing system than C-AF, C-AK and C-AJ cattle...|$|R
