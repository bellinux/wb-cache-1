In order to address this issue, tool <b>wear</b> monitoring and <b>compensation</b> in µEDM has become a thrust area of research.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is mainly to develop an {{information}} and communication technology (ICT) -based intelligent dimension inspection and tool <b>wear</b> <b>compensation</b> method for precision tuning. With the use of vibration signal processing/characteristics analysis technology combined with ICT, statistical analysis, and diagnosis algorithms, the method can be used to proceed with an on-line dimension inspection and on-machine tool wear auto-compensation for the turning process. Meanwhile, the method can also monitor critical tool life to identify the appropriate time for cutter replacement to reduce machining costs and improve the production efficiency of the turning process. Compared to the traditional ways, the method offers the advantages of requiring less manpower, and having better production efficiency, high tool life, fewer scrap parts, and low costs for inspection instruments. Algorithms and diagnosis threshold values for the detection, cutter <b>wear</b> <b>compensation,</b> and cutter life monitoring were developed. In addition, a bilateral communication module utilizing FANUC Open CNC (computer numerical control) Application Programming Interface (API) Spec was developed for the on-line extraction of instant NC (numerical control) codes for monitoring and transmit commands to CNC controllers for cutter <b>wear</b> <b>compensation.</b> With use of local area networks (LAN) to deliver the detection and correction information, the proposed method was able to remotely control the on-machine monitoring process and upload the machining and inspection data to a remote central platform for further production optimization.

40|$|Abstract. The {{designing}} of a micro turbine for micro {{gas turbine}} engine is presented in this paper. Micro power system {{is becoming more and}} more important for micro- and nano-scale system. The fast development of MEMS (Micro Electromechanical Systems) has strongly enhanced the application of new harder work materials. The fabrication of metallic 3 D microstructures has been one of the most attractive topics of micro machining. Currently the basic materials of Micro-turbine Engineering were nonmetal materials such as SiC, most of them are 2 D or quasi- 3 D structures. As a low cost, flexible, good repeatable machining process with negligible process forces, micro-EDM milling is well suited for freeform metallic micro structures. A three-dimensional micro turbine was fabricated by micro-EDM milling. A major problem in micro-EDM milling of complex 3 D structure by using micro-electrode is the electrode wear. For reducing the impact of electrode wear, A new CAM system based on the UG software platform is developed in order to get good accuracy 2 and higher efficiency. A simple tool path generation by CAD/CAM software and a general electrode <b>wear</b> <b>compensation</b> strategy is presented. The <b>wear</b> <b>compensation</b> can be apart from the design of CAD/CAM systems, so existing common CAD/CAM systems can be used to generate milling tool path with an unequal thickness lamination. And then post process for <b>wear</b> <b>compensation</b> and EDM milling can be done to modify tool path by adding <b>wear</b> <b>compensation.</b> The micro turbine blades of which the material is nickel alloy (GH 4169) were successfully fabricated by using this strategy.

40|$|The linear tool <b>wear</b> <b>compensation</b> method (LCM) is {{commonly}} applied in micro-EDM 3 -D milling {{to compensate the}} tool length wear {{in order to achieve}} high machining accuracy. Traditional LCMs mainly rely on empirical models and off-line wear measurements, whereas the process dynamics are not taken into account. When machining complex 3 D cavities, an increasing number of tool <b>wear</b> <b>compensation</b> cycles have usually to be performed {{in order to maintain the}} targeted machining accuracy. This negatively affects the duration of the overall machining cycle. To realize efficient precision micro-EDM cavity milling, without the necessity to predefine Z-axis tool feed in the NC trajectory before machining, an in-situ process control system is developed to adaptively control the tool <b>wear</b> <b>compensation</b> factor based on the discharge pulse behavior. Experiments have shown that the change of the compensation factor can be detected and also a continuous increase of the factor (over compensation) leads to the saturation of the mean effective pulse frequency. Pulse monitoring therefore provides valuable information for understanding the process dynamics and for selecting the machining parameters towards better machining efficiency. Furthermore, the information gathered in-situ can be utilized to predict the tool wear and perform in-situ tool wear prediction. To implement this on machine-level, a combined off-line and in-line adaptive control of the tool <b>wear</b> <b>compensation</b> factor is proposed and experimentally validated by milling different 3 D cavities. The off-line adaptive control is only necessary when the predicted machining depth error exceeds a certain limit. In this way, more than 80 % of the off-line adaptive control cycles can be eliminated, whereby a total save of cycle time up to 18 % has been reached, while still maintaining the desired dimensional and form accuracy. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In micro {{electrical}} discharge milling it {{is necessary}} to calibrate empirically tool <b>wear</b> <b>compensation</b> strategies in order to accurately adjust the tool-workpiece relative position and achieve high precision machining. The measurement of the material removed from both tool and workpiece is of paramount importance, since tool <b>wear</b> <b>compensation</b> and machining simulation rely on this information. On-machine volume measurements enable process parameters optimization based on self-learning procedures as well as the implementation of process monitoring algorithms. Commercially available electrical discharge machines allow the detection of electrical contacts between the tool and the workpiece electrodes by sensing low voltage short-circuits. This capability can be exploited to set the workpiece coordinate system and to perform dimensional measurements of tool and workpiece, using the tool electrode similarly to the touch probe in a coordinate measuring machine. However, accurate and traceable measurements of volumes can be challenging and a metrological validation of the method is missing. In this work an investigation of the accuracy of the on-the-machine volume measurements in a micro electrical discharge milling setup is carried out. An evaluation of the error affecting on-machine measurements is provided, and best practices for the applicability of the method are discussed...|$|R

These ceramic composites are difficult to be machined at microscale by conventional processing techniques. More specifically, the influence of process parameters on machining performances such as machining speed, tool wear and surface quality is studied in detail {{with the aid of}} the statistical Design of Experiment methods. Also, an in-depth analysis of the micro-EDM pulse generator is conducted to derive optimised machining strategies leading to maximum efficiency as well as to optimal machining accuracy. Each ceramic composite shows distinctive material removal mechanisms under variable machining conditions. Therefore, the correlation between material properties, machining results and input discharge pulse shapes has been investigated by extensive experiments. Furthermore, by exploring the process limits, it is experimentally proven that these ceramic composites can be shaped by micro-EDM process. Tool wear of the electrodes proves {{to be one of the}} critical factors affecting the dimensional and geometrical form accuracy of the micro-EDM milling process.

This study evaluated the retention force changes of different prefabricated attachment systems for implant-supported overdentures to estimate the wear constancy and applicability in clinical practice. METHODS: Four prefabricated attachment systems were tested [Group SG: retentive ball attachment (Straumann, Switzerland) with gold matrix, Group ST: retentive ball attachment (Straumann, Switzerland) with titanium spring matrix, Group IB: UNOR i-Ball with Ecco matrix (UNOR, Switzerland) and Group IMZ: IMZ-TwinPlus ball attachment with gold matrix (DENTSPLY Friadent, Germany) ]. Ten samples of each system were subjected to 10, 000 insertion-separation cycles. RESULTS: Results showed that all types of attachments showed wear, which led {{to a loss of}} retention force after an initial increase {{at the beginning of the}} wear simulation. Attachments with a plastic retention insert or gold matrices underwent the smallest changes in retention force. The titanium spring system showed the largest changes in retention force and a greater variation between the different cycles and specimen. This behaviour is probably caused by a large fitting tolerance of the titanium spring.

40|$|Due to {{the high}} {{precision}} and good surface quality that it can give, Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) is potentially an important process for the fabrication of micro tools, micro components and parts with micro features. However, {{a number of issues}} remain to be solved before micro EDM can become a reliable process with repeatable results and its full capabilities as a micro manufacturing technology can be realised. This work presents some developments in advancing the state-of-the-art in the micro EDM process. EDM drilling and EDM milling are regarded as separate processes as they require different approaches in investigating and implementing the results of the study. At the beginning, special attention is paid to factors and procedures influencing the accuracy achievable, including positioning approaches during EDM and electrode grinding. In particular, the main parameters affecting the size and position of a machined feature are discussed and new techniques for minimising errors are proposed. The technological capabilities of different methods of setting up and dressing the electrode on the machine are analysed. Factors contributing to electrode wear, the main systematic cause for inaccuracy of the dimensions achieved, during the micro EDM process are studied. A method for calculating the volumetric wear ratio based only on geometrical information obtained from the process is proposed. This study investigates the suitability of micro EDM electrode <b>wear</b> <b>compensation</b> methods. Electrode shape deformation and random variations in the volumetric wear are also investigated as the two main factors affecting the applicability of the <b>wear</b> <b>compensation</b> methods as well as indicating the accuracy achievable with micro EDM. When producing features and parts on the micro scale, the phenomena that take place between the electrodes in EDM is not fully understood. A barrier to a complete exploitation of the potential natural tolerance of this process and to the further development of the process towards the production of components on the nano-scale is therefore in place. An analytical micro EDM model of electrode wear based on electrode shape deformation and wear ratio is suggested, verification of which requires experimental work with pure metals. Electrode-tool wear is studied during the micro EDM process of pure metals and the effect of electrode wear on the process accuracy and process variability. Objectives in this case are to advance the experimental knowledge of the electrical discharges during micro EDM operations which often conflicts with existent theoretical models of the EDM process. In particular, the remit of this investigation is to identify the effects that electrode materials have on selected electrical characteristics of the discharge process. An exploratory data analysis (EDA) approach is adopted in order to draw conclusions from the performed experimental activity. The material removal mechanism in the micro EDM process was confirmed to be mainly attributed to the melting and vaporisation phenomenon. Metal removal takes place {{as a result of the}} extremely high temperature generated by the discharge sparks. It was also found in this study that the volumetric wear ratio depends not only on the sparking conditions but also on the electrode materials. In addition, the research also proved that the electrode material severely influences the energy distribution between the electrodes during the sparks.

50|$|As {{with any}} V8, the block was {{relatively}} light for the displacement supported. The {{bottom of the}} block formed the parting line for the main bearing caps. The most complex part of the block was the exhaust passage routing. The exhaust valves were {{on the inside of}} the V and exhaust flow was initially downward and passed around the cylinders through the water jacket to exit on the outside of the cylinder block. The routing of the exhaust through the water jacket put an extremely heavy load on the cooling system and led to frequent overheating, especially on early models, if the cooling system were not maintained. Somewhat primitive water pumps used until the advent of the 1948 8RT and 1949 8BA models also contributed to the overheating problem. The space for the exhaust flow was also somewhat restricted, so the exhaust passages were tall and narrow in some locations. The gas flow past the rough sand castings could be greatly improved by polishing the passages. The capacity of the block for over-boring (beyond normal boring for <b>wear</b> <b>compensation)</b> was limited by the configuration and the metal available. In early blocks, some cylinder walls were extremely thin due to cores shifting during casting. It was prudent to overbore before relieving and polishing the ports, as a casting flaw such as a sand pit might be revealed, usually fatal to further use of the block. The blocks with the factory 3- (3.1875) inch bore can usually be safely bored 1/8 inch over standard to 3.3125 in and sometimes can be bored 3/16 inch over standard to 3.375 in, increasing displacement a little over 12%.|$|R

Cone crusher control systems are widely used for <b>wear</b> <b>compensation</b> and machine protection. These systems ordinarily focus on the crusher and not the crushed products. The eccentric speed in a cone crusher determines the number of times a material is compressed and thus the particle size distribution of the product. The speed of the crusher is usually fixed since speed changes are only possible by shifting pulleys, a process which is quite time-consuming. By applying a frequency converter to the crusher motor power supply, it is possible to continuously adjust the eccentric speed. The cost for frequency converters has decreased significantly over the last decade. By applying mass-flow sensors to the process, the crusher can be run optimally to yield the most sellable products in a given moment. The manufactured product type varies with season, e. g., materials for road maintenance in the winter or asphalt during the summer. Existing systems normally only protect the machine. The sensors can be mass-flow meters, e. g., conveyor-belt scales. To analyze data from the process and calculate the appropriate value for the Closed Side Setting (CSS) and eccentric speed, algorithms have been developed. The algorithms are loaded into a computer that can communicate with sensors and crushers. The developed algorithms are tested and evolved at real aggregate crushing plants. Crushing stage performance increased 3. 5 % compared to a fixed CSS when the algorithm was implemented on top of the existing control system. The algorithm automatically compensates for changes in the feed material and also decreases the need for calibration of the CSS. The crushing stage where the speed algorithm was tested increased its performance (yield of required products) by 4 %. As a bonus, the lifetime of the mantles increased 27 % on the evaluated crusher...|$|R
50|$|Johannmeyer {{was among}} the {{occupants}} of the Führerbunker, Hitler's underground headquarters in encircled Berlin. Johannmeyer was present at Hitler's last birthday ceremony on 20 April 1945. During the night of 28-29 April, Hitler ordered that three copies of his political testament be hand-delivered to Field Marshal Ferdinand Schörner in Czechoslovakia, Karl Dönitz in Schleswig-Holstein, and Paul Giesler in Tegernsee by Willy Johannmeyer, Bormann's adjutant SS-Standartenführer Wilhelm Zander and Chief Press Secretary (Stellvertretender Pressechef) Heinz Lorenz, respectively. The three officers said their farewell to Hitler and were handed a white dossier with the testament by Martin Bormann at approximately 4.00 am on 29 April. Armed with <b>automatic</b> weapons, <b>wearing</b> helmets and uniforms to break through Soviet lines, the officers left Berlin later that day.|$|R

The {{deviation}} often {{appears in}} the feeding device of machine because of the screw spindle geometry torsional moment and the <b>wear.</b> The <b>automatic</b> <b>compensation</b> of the changes was proposed {{by means of a}} ball screw pretightening device by using adjustable force measurement and control. The detail design and simulation were conducted for the specific device. A case study was presented for the CNC lathe’s application. Testing results have shown that the device can be easily operated with an acceptable precision for positioning...|$|R
