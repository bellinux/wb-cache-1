The city is also {{where one of the}} miracles that have happened in my life took place: I met Ma Anandamayi, a great spiritual soul. Seeing the beauty of her face and mind, I became her ardent devotee. Sitting at home now in Encinitas, in Southern California, at the age of 88, surrounded by the beautiful greens, multi-colored flowers, blue sky, clean air, and the Pacific Ocean, I often reminisce about all the wonderful places I have seen in the world. I cherish the memories of Paris, New York, and a few other places. But Varanasi seems to be etched in my heart!" ...|$|E
500|$|Bannon did not {{outwardly}} advertise {{the fact}} that the books had been released again in her department at Sacramento State. Not being tenured, she was unsure how the information would be received. However, word got out: [...] "I was jet-propelled out of the closet. People stared at me around campus, and the PE majors all waved. My chairman told me to put the books into my promotion file, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> colleagues told me my file {{was the only one that}} was any fun." [...] She often received small recognitions from students and faculty who were pleased and surprised, once getting a bouquet of flowers from a student. She said of the rediscovery, [...] "I was so ready for something fresh and exciting in my life. It had seemed to me, up to that point, that not only had the books and the characters died, so had Ann Bannon." [...] However, following a bitter divorce, and just as the Naiad Press editions of her books were released, Bannon endured a bout of chronic fatigue syndrome, which she connects to repressing herself for so long. [...] "You've got to think that it's connected, somehow. At the time I denied it fiercely, but I really think I beat myself up horribly, in ways I'll never know." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "All the Lovers" [...] {{was directed by}} Joseph Kahn, {{who is known for}} having previously collaborated with American recording artist Britney Spears on the videos for her singles [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "Womanizer". It was filmed in Downtown Los Angeles, the central business district of Los Angeles, California, in early May 2010. Aiming to pay [...] "homage" [...] to her large gay audience, Minogue wanted the video to express [...] "what I'm about and what I love" [...] and thus it was made to depict scenes of same-sex kissing. Arts and culture magazine BlackBook reported that the video, which portrays a large group of underwear-clad men and women, is a re-imagination of the installations of Spencer Tunick, an American photographer known for organising large-scale nude shoots. Minogue credited Kahn for the idea behind the video, saying [...] "He came up with a brilliant, simple idea and executed it so sensitively, I thought. It's still cutting edge, it still gets you a little hot under the collar, but I think there's a real sensitivity." [...] Initially, two ideas for the storyline arose, one which was a [...] "little gentler" [...] and one which was [...] "edgier", and in the end the latter option was finalised. When Kahn submitted his cut of the video to Parlophone, a person working for the label refused to release it and wanted a new one to be shot. However, at Minogue's interference the video was finally commissioned and released. A preview of the video was released on 25 May 2010 while the full version was premiered five days later. It was made available to download at the iTunes Store on 11 June 2010. In 2011, Kahn talked about working with Minogue and called her the [...] "dream artist to work with" [...] and a [...] "joy to photograph", praising her ability to [...] "understand" [...] directors. He further commented that: [...] " [...] is one of my favourite videos I did last year, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> favourites ever really. The message Kylie wanted to say with this video is important, and I am lucky to have worked with her on it." ...|$|E

[...] Norris, who has played several cops before in film and television, stated: Having played so many cops, I've talked with a lot of technical advisers, so I've been able to pick up a lot. Coincidentally, {{one of my best friends}} growing up is a cop in Chicago, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> other best friends out in LA is a sheriff. So I get to see all the components of that culture.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, {{speaking}} to Kerrang!, Max Cavalera remembered: [...] "This certainly {{got in touch}} with the dark side of Sepultura. [...] "Refuse/Resist" [...] is an anti-police song – a real piece of anarchy. You could call the album riot music. It was full of heavy shit and some of it was risky, but it was just where we were coming from at the time. [...] "Manifest" [...] is also very close to me. That's about a massacre of prisoners by police at a jail in São Paulo. One hundred and eleven prisoners were killed, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> friends was there and took pictures of it all, one of which we used in the artwork." ...|$|E

I retain tolerably distinct impressions <b>of</b> both <b>of</b> <b>my</b> grandfathers, <b>and</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> grandmothers; my mother's mother having died long before my own parents were married.|$|R
2500|$|In December 2010, Kardashian filmed a {{music video}} {{for a song}} titled [...] "Jam (Turn It Up)". The video was {{directed}} by Hype Williams; Kanye West makes a cameo in the video. Kardashian premiered the song during a New Year's Eve party at TAO Las Vegas on December 31, 2010. The song was produced by The-Dream and Tricky Stewart. When asked if an album was in the works, Kardashian replied, [...] "There's no album in the works or anything—just one song we did for Kourtney and Kim Take New York, and a video Hype Williams directed, half of the proceeds we're giving away to a cancer foundation, because The-Dream's <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> parents passed away from cancer. It's just all having fun—with a good cause". Jim Farber, writing for the Daily News, called the song a [...] "dead-brained piece of generic dance music, without a single distinguishing feature," [...] and suggested that the single made Kardashian the [...] "worst singer in the reality TV universe." ...|$|E
