5|$|As {{printing}} became available, it {{was promptly}} used to publish herbals, the first printed matter being known as incunabula. In Europe, the first printed herbal with woodcut (xylograph) illustrations, the Puch der Natur of Konrad of Megenberg, appeared in 1475. Metal-engraved plates were first used in about 1580. As woodcuts and metal engravings could be reproduced indefinitely they were traded among printers: there was therefore a large {{increase in the}} number of illustrations together with <b>an</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> quality and detail but a tendency for repetition.|$|E
5|$|Chemotherapy may be {{combined}} with palliative care {{in the treatment of}} the NSCLC. In advanced cases, appropriate chemotherapy improves average survival over supportive care alone, as well as improving quality of life. With adequate physical fitness maintaining chemotherapy during lung cancer palliation offers 1.5 to 3 months of prolongation of survival, symptomatic relief, and <b>an</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> quality of life, with better results seen with modern agents. The NSCLC Meta-Analyses Collaborative Group recommends if the recipient wants and can tolerate treatment, then chemotherapy should be considered in advanced NSCLC.|$|E

5|$|In 1937, Ravel {{began to}} suffer pain from his condition, and was {{examined}} by Clovis Vincent, a well-known Paris neurosurgeon. Vincent advised surgical treatment.

Ravel's brother Edouard accepted this advice; as Henson comments, the patient was in no state to express a considered view.

5|$|After {{four years}} in retirement, he {{received}} an unexpected invitation to become Master of Peterhouse in 1987, thus becoming {{the first person in}} over four centuries to lead a college at both Oxford and Cambridge. Chadwick's second appointment as head of a college proved a happier experience than his first. The college had been experiencing some problems following the admission of the first female students, to which some fellows were implacably opposed, making their displeasure known at High Table. Chadwick insisted on civility, which coupled with the retirement of some of the fellows, ensured <b>an</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> the atmosphere within the college. This continued after his second retirement (again to Oxford) in 1993. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1989 Queen's Birthday Honours. In 1991 he published a new translation of Augustine's Confessions, with extensive notes revealing Augustine's debt to Plotinus.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{guidance}} from the Secretary of the Army, CDC established Qualitative Material Development Objectives (QMDO) for a rotary-wing aircraft with 195-knot (224mph, 361km/h) cruise speed, 220-knot (253mph, 407km/h) dash speed, and {{the capability to}} hover out-of-ground-effect (OGE) at 6,000feet (1,830m) on a 95°F (35°C) day. The speed requirements were derived from the speed of aircraft the helicopter would escort. The Director of Defense Research and Engineering (DDRE) conditionally approved the changes to the development objectives, pending his review of the proposed program. He also directed the Army {{to determine whether or}} not any other helicopter could offer <b>an</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> performance over the UH-1B in the meantime.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{this period}} of success, the club failed to attract {{significant}} local support.

5|$|During the {{turbulent}} {{era of the}} Civil Wars and the incorporation of Scotland into a Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland, significant building in Scotland was largely confined to military architecture. Polygonal fortresses with triangular bastions {{in the style of}} the trace italienne were built to house English soldiers at Ayr, Perth and Leith, and 20 smaller forts were built as far apart as Orkney and Stornoway. Control of the Highlands was secured by new strongpoints at Inverlocky and Inverness. The universities saw <b>an</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> their funding, as they were given income from deaneries, defunct bishoprics and the excise, allowing the completion of buildings including the college in the High Street in Glasgow. After the Restoration in 1660, large-scale building began again, influenced by a growing interest in Classicism.|$|E
5|$|Enrollment {{continued}} to rise, {{and by the}} end of his tenure, Ross requested that parents first communicate with his office before sending their sons to the school. The increase in students necessitated <b>an</b> <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> facilities, and from late 1891 until September 1898, the college spent over $97,000 on improvements and new buildings. This included construction of a mess hall, which could seat 500 diners at once, an infirmary, which included the first indoor toilets on campus, an artesian well, a natatorium, four faculty residences, an electric light plant, an ice works, a laundry, a cold storage room, a slaughterhouse, a gymnasium, a warehouse, and an artillery shed. Despite the expenditures on facilities, the school treasury held a surplus in 1893 and 1894. The 1894 financial report credited the surplus to Ross's leadership, and Ross ensured the money was returned to the students in the form of lower fees.|$|E

While staying at Londesborough Lodge, near Scarborough, North Yorkshire, Edward contracted typhoid, the disease that was believed to have killed his father. There was great national concern, and one of his fellow guests (Lord Chesterfield) died. Edward's recovery was greeted with almost universal relief. Public celebrations included the composition of Arthur Sullivan's Festival Te Deum. Edward cultivated politicians from all parties, including republicans, as his friends, and thereby largely dissipated any residual feelings against him.|$|E
