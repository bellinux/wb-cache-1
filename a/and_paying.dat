5|$|In the 970s, Haakon Sigurdsson, Jarl of Lade, {{became the}} most {{powerful}} man in Norway, at first supported by Harald Bluetooth of Denmark <b>and</b> <b>paying</b> tribute to him—though the two later fell out over religious matters. Harald had converted to Christianity and was eager to Christianise Norway, while Haakon remained a staunch pagan. In 995 Haakon was deposed and the young Christian leader Olaf Tryggvason came to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Officers were {{responsible}} for providing (<b>and</b> <b>paying</b> for) their own uniforms; consequently, variable style and decoration was present, according to the officer's private means. Equipment could consume {{a significant portion of}} an officer's pay; during the Napoleonic era, the 52nd's plain regimental sabre, for example, cost 4 guineas, approximately 16 days' pay for an ensign.|$|E

WhaT ThIS REpoRT addS: • This is the first study to analyse average hourly <b>pay</b> gaps <b>and</b> <b>pay</b> penalties by gender and ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual orientation and age. • Gender <b>pay</b> gaps <b>and</b> penalties tend to persist, regardless of group. Most groups of ethnic minority women and men (though not all) experience <b>pay</b> gaps <b>and</b> <b>pay</b> penalties, but the variation across groups stands out. • disabled women and men experience substantial <b>pay</b> gaps <b>and</b> <b>pay</b> penalties. • younger and older workers experience pay gaps, but do not tend to suffer pay penalties. • The findings on religion and sexual orientation are mixed. • The higher qualified you are, the less {{likely you are to}} suffer <b>pay</b> gaps <b>and</b> <b>pay</b> penalties, though this does not hold for every group...|$|R

5|$|According to {{the disputed}} {{statements}} of the ancient writers and some modern scholars, in Athens Aspasia became a hetaera and probably ran a brothel. Hetaerae were professional high-class entertainers, as well as courtesans. Besides displaying physical beauty, they differed from most Athenian women in being educated (often to a high standard, as in Aspasia's case), having independence, <b>and</b> <b>paying</b> taxes. They were the nearest thing perhaps to liberated women; and Aspasia, who became a vivid figure in Athenian society, was probably an obvious example. According to Plutarch, Aspasia was compared to the famous Thargelia, another renowned Ionian hetaera of ancient times.|$|E
5|$|After the crisis, superpower {{relations}} improved, as Kennedy gave a conciliatory {{speech at}} American University on 10 June 1963, recognizing the Soviet people's suffering during World War II, <b>and</b> <b>paying</b> tribute to their achievements. Khrushchev called the speech the best by a U.S. president since Franklin Roosevelt, and, in July, negotiated a {{test ban treaty}} with U.S. negotiator Averell Harriman and with Lord Hailsham of the United Kingdom. Plans for a second Khrushchev-Kennedy summit were dashed by the U.S. President's assassination in November 1963. The new U.S. President, Lyndon Johnson, hoped for continued improved relations but was distracted by other issues and had little opportunity to develop a relationship with Khrushchev before the premier was ousted.|$|E
5|$|By 536, he {{was raised}} to the honorary {{consulate}} and the rank of patricius, and held the post of magister militum praesentalis. In that year, {{he was sent to}} North Africa to succeed Solomon as military commander, with the task of suppressing a large-scale mutiny of the Byzantine troops led by Stotzas. His tenure there, described by Procopius, was a thorough success. By appearing conciliatory <b>and</b> <b>paying</b> the arrears, he won over {{a large part of the}} mutinous army. He then defeated the remaining rebels under Stotzas at the Battle of Scalas Veteres in the spring of 537 and stabilized the situation by suppressing another conspiracy amongst his troops (cf. Maximinus) and restoring discipline.|$|E

5|$|In March 1888, while Mansfield's {{company was}} touring, Daniel E. Bandmann staged a {{competing}} production {{with the same}} name at Niblo's Garden. Bandmann's opening night (March 12) coincided with the Great Blizzard of 1888, and only five theatergoers braved the storm. One of the attendees was Sullivan, who was checking his competition. Bandmann's production inspired a letter from Stevenson to the New York Sun saying that only the Mansfield version was authorized <b>and</b> <b>paying</b> him royalties.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} known American lodges were in Pennsylvania. The Collector for {{the port}} of Pennsylvania, John Moore, wrote of attending lodges there in 1715, {{two years before the}} formation of the first Grand Lodge in London. The Premier Grand Lodge of England appointed a Provincial Grand Master for North America in 1731, based in Pennsylvania. Other lodges in the colony obtained authorisations from the later Antient Grand Lodge of England, the Grand Lodge of Scotland, and the Grand Lodge of Ireland, which was particularly well represented in the travelling lodges of the British Army. Many lodges came into existence with no warrant from any Grand Lodge, applying <b>and</b> <b>paying</b> for their authorisation only after they were confident of their own survival.|$|E
5|$|The war, the {{pre-eminent}} {{episode of}} Sultan Selim II's reign, {{began with the}} Ottoman invasion of the Venetian-held island of Cyprus. The capital Nicosia and several other towns fell quickly to the considerably superior Ottoman army, leaving only Famagusta in Venetian hands. Christian reinforcements were delayed, and Famagusta eventually fell in August 1571 after a siege of 11 months. Two months later, at the Battle of Lepanto, the united Christian fleet destroyed the Ottoman fleet, {{but was unable to}} take advantage of this victory. The Ottomans quickly rebuilt their naval forces, and Venice was forced to negotiate a separate peace, ceding Cyprus to the Ottomans <b>and</b> <b>paying</b> a tribute of 300,000 ducats.|$|E
5|$|When Larry Schmittou {{decided to}} bring {{professional}} baseball back to Nashville in the late 1970s, {{he knew he would}} have to build a new ballpark for his team. He negotiated a lease with the city for a plot of land at the foot of St. Cloud Hill on the grounds of Fort Negley, an American Civil War fortification, approximately two miles (three km) south of downtown. At the time, this was the site of a city-owned softball complex that the city planned to relocate. The city was prepared to lease him the land, but Schmittou would be responsible for building the stadium, paying the property taxes, <b>and</b> <b>paying</b> the city a portion of the team's total revenue.|$|E

5|$|Eldred {{arrived in}} Italy in July 1918 and {{eventually}} at Sub Chaser Base 25, located in Corfu, Greece in September 1918. There {{he served as}} a machinist aboard submarine chaser SC-244, where they patrolled the Strait of Otranto and were engaged in combat. While in Corfu, Eldred and many others got sick with the flu during the 1918 flu pandemic. The conditions at the hospital were so bad that he had to crawl to a stream to get water, which resulted in a permanent scar on his left hip. Eldred began his return to the United States and arrived in Malta on December 25, 1918. By February 1919, he was in Gibraltar. He was given the option of staying in the Navy until they arrived home in six months or being discharged <b>and</b> <b>paying</b> his own way home. He elected the discharge and was separated from the Navy on March 4, 1919. He met some U.S. Army soldiers who were en route to America aboard an Army troop ship. They took him aboard as a stowaway and loaned him an Army uniform. Eldred slept in a life boat {{on the way back to}} America.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{situation}} {{improved in}} May 1119 when he enticed Fulk to switch sides by finally agreeing to marry William Adelin to Fulk's daughter, Matilda, <b>and</b> <b>paying</b> Fulk {{a large sum}} of money. Fulk left for the Levant, leaving the County of Maine in Henry's care, and the King was free to focus on crushing his remaining enemies. During the summer Henry advanced into the Norman Vexin, where he encountered Louis's army, resulting in the Battle of Brémule. Henry appears to have deployed scouts and then organised his troops into several carefully formed lines of dismounted knights. Unlike Henry's forces, the French knights remained mounted; they hastily charged the Anglo-Norman positions, breaking through the first rank of the defences but then becoming entangled in Henry's second line of knights. Surrounded, the French army began to collapse. In the melee, Henry {{was hit by a}} sword blow, but his armour protected him. Louis and William Clito escaped from the battle, leaving Henry to return to Rouen in triumph.|$|E
