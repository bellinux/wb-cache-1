A specialist in underwater archaeology at Florida State University added, [...] "It would be cool if they were right, but it would be real advanced for anything we would see in the New World for that time frame.

50|$|Jumping {{the train}} near the dam, the team splits up: Miller and Weaver set off diversionary {{explosives}} while Mallory and Barnsby {{sneak into the}} dam. Weaver runs into Captain Drazak {{in the woods and}} kills him in a knife fight. Mallory and Barnsby set their charges within the dam but realise that they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> With the German assault only minutes away, they are forced to set a short fuse, leaving them no time to escape. Mallory and Barnsby are caught in the explosion, yet nevertheless survive. At first, the dam appears undamaged; but with its fragile structural integrity disrupted, the dam wall collapses, releasing millions of tons of water in a wave that topples the bridge. The German assault is thwarted, saving Petrovich and the Partisans.|$|E
50|$|It's a Seminar! Everyone GO-ON!! (Semināru da yo! Zen'in Gō On!!) is {{a special}} DVD in which Bomper lets each of the Go-ongers do their own special seminar on ecology and also tie into the three Gaiark Pollution Ministers. Sōsuke and Gunpei start by helping Renn show how water and oil can't be mixed as Speedor covers Kegalesia and her Water Savage Machine Beasts. Then Hanto shows how clean air is {{essential}} for people in an exercise experiment that nearly suffocates Gunpei from breathing in too much polluted air and being saved by inhaling helium by mistake as Speedor explains about Kitaneidas and his Savage Air Machine Beasts along with the Go-on Wings. After Gunpei's voice returns to normal, Saki begins her lesson though unaware {{she was supposed to}} teach a lesson though she grew strawberries from polluted soil and made a cake from strawberries that she grew in clean soil. As Sōsuke and Gunpei get the tea for her, Speedor talks about Yogostien and his Savage Machine Beasts, as well Hiramechimedes and all the events leading to Yogostein's death. The last seminar is cut short when Hiramechimedes' cross-dressing older brother Kokorootomedes goes after Sōsuke out of revenge, but is destroyed by Go-on Red's Kankan Kong Express Speedor Version after a tough fight. Just as Gunpei decides to give a seminar on how to be cool like himself, Bomper says that they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and the seminars are over.|$|E

She is thrilled until Isabel reveals {{that she is}} a Republican (and to make matters worse, when Lisa asks her if she is a Lincoln or a Reagan Republican or even a George H.W. Bush Republican, Isabel says no). The two girls end up running against each other for class president, and the Springfield Republican Party tells Isabel they are thrilled with her {{decision}} and want to offer their services, as she is the kind of Latina voter the GOP will need in the future. However, Isabel tells them to butt out, because she {{is not going to be}} [...] "owned" [...] by them. The GOP decides to use some dirty tricks anyway, and Lisa is angry with Isabel when she thinks her classmate supported the actions, but respects her when she learns the local GOP people are just acting like jerks. In a class debate, Lisa tells the assembled students that if believing that those with a lot should help those with nothing makes her a liberal, then yes, she is a liberal and proud of it. At the final debate, the two walk away from their podia and Isabel says they want to set aside politics and would be happy for whichever of them wins, Lisa goes to say the same, and is cut off by Superintendent Chalmers, saying they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> The election goes to Isabel in a close vote, but Lisa is extremely heartened by an exit poll that reveals 53% of the students agree with her views; she says that this means they do not like her, but would vote for someone who shares her ideas, and that is a happy end result.|$|E

30|$|According to Mosco, {{social life}} is {{comprised}} of the mutual constitution of structure and agency: “structures <b>are</b> constituted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> human agency, even as they provide the very ‘medium’ of that constitution” (Mosco 2009 : 185). Structure, as Giddens argues, {{is regarded as the}} rules and resources recursively implicated in social reproduction. Structure <b>is</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and space and marked by an “absence of subject” (Giddens 1984 : 25). However, social systems, in which structure is recursively implicated, also comprise the situated activities of human agents that are reproduced across time and space. Therefore, the analysis of social systems incorporates the ideas of agency, social relations, and social practice into the political economic analysis of social structures.|$|R
