25|$|Hedberg {{suffered}} from stage fright throughout his career; he often performed in sunglasses, {{with his head}} down <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> in his face or his eyes closed, and sometimes stood upstage or {{with his back to}} the audience, constantly moving in place. At times, he nervously shook his microphone unconsciously.|$|E
25|$|The unknown man had {{a slender}} build, short grey hair, and {{appeared}} to be in his late 50s or early 60s. He stood five feet and ten and a half inches tall with blue eyes and a tan complexion. From witness reports, the man was of Germanic descent and spoke with a thick German accent. He was neatly groomed; his face was shaven <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> was clean and combed.|$|E
25|$|After his conviction, Castor disappeared. Seven months later, he {{was found}} while visiting the Auto Show at the Anhembi Convention Center in São Paulo on October 26, 1994. He was {{disguised}} with a fake goatee <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> and moustache were painted in black. Rogério de Andrade and Ana Paula de Andrade e Silva, his two nephews, were accompanying him. He later admitted to the police that he loved cars {{since he was a}} child and could not resist the temptation to visit the Auto Show.|$|E
60|$|And {{kneeling}} on the flint stones of the Valley of Desolation he saw {{a young man who}} was naked <b>and</b> weeping. <b>His</b> <b>hair</b> was the colour of honey, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> body was as a white flower, but he had wounded his body with thorns <b>and</b> on <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> had he set ashes as a crown.|$|R

25|$|Gable's acting coach, Josephine Dillon — {{a theater}} manager in Portland – was 17 {{years older than}} him. She paid to have his teeth {{repaired}} <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> styled. She guided him in building up his chronically undernourished body, and taught him better body control and posture. She spent considerable time training his naturally high-pitched voice, which he slowly managed to lower, to gain better resonance and tone. As his speech habits improved, his facial expressions became more natural and convincing. After {{a long period of}} training, Dillon considered him ready to attempt a film career.|$|E
25|$|He {{was taken}} to prison, where he {{remained}} for eight months, throughout which he was gravely ill; he lost nearly all of his eyesight <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> fell out. After this first imprisonment, Maroto was exiled to Seville and from there was able to obtain a transfer to Granada, where he reunited {{with his family and}} decided to rededicate his life to their care. After a time, he was secretly informed that he would be newly imprisoned and moved to a cell in Ceuta. Maroto rapidly prepared his escape, disguised, helped physically and economically by friends and accompanied and guided on the voyage by some smugglers.|$|E
25|$|On Sunday, September 19, 2004, all {{teams of}} the NFL wore a {{memorial}} decal on their helmets {{in honor of}} Tillman. The Arizona Cardinals continued to wear this decal throughout the 2004 season. Former Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummer requested to also wear the decal for the entire season, but the NFL turned him down, saying his helmet would not be uniform {{with the rest of}} the Denver Broncos. Plummer later grew a full beard <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> long in honor of Tillman, who had such a style in the NFL before cutting his hair and shaving his beard off to fit military uniform guidelines.|$|E

25|$|He is {{described}} as having a dark complexion, large eyes and a long beard. He was tall and slender <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> and beard remained black until he was very old. He was attentive to his health, avoiding red meat, fats and other foods he deemed unhealthy. He was seldom sick before his last decade when he suffered from bouts of pleurisy. When he was ill, he treated himself (to the approval of physicians). He {{had a sense of}} humour, though serious subjects he treated seriously. He had studied poetry when young and enjoyed writing, reciting and participating in poetic exchanges. It is said that he was asked in Egypt about al-Tirimmah and was able to recite this 7th century poet's work for Egyptians who had merely heard al-Tirimmah's name.|$|E
25|$|Hao Meng {{was from}} Henei Commandery (河內郡), {{which is in}} present-day Henan. One night in the sixth lunar month of 196, he rebelled against Lü Bu in Xiapi (下邳; present-day Pizhou, Jiangsu), the capital of Lü Bu's domain, Xu Province, and led his men to attack Lü Bu's headquarters. He was unable {{to break into the}} building. Lü Bu was not aware of the identities of the rebels, but he heard their voices and {{recognised}} from their accents that they were from Henei. He was bare-bodied <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> was dishevelled when the attack occurred. Lü Bu and his wife escaped by climbing over the wall and then they fled to the camp of Gao Shun, one of Lü's subordinates. Lü Bu told Gao Shun about the Henei accents he heard, and Gao deduced that the rebel leader was Hao Meng. Gao Shun then led his troops to Lü Bu's office and drove the rebels away by firing arrows at them. Hao Meng and his men retreated back to their own camp.|$|E
25|$|Several {{scenes are}} also {{omitted from the}} director's cut, {{including}} one where the knights sit around a camp fire asking about their intended Sarmatian life, in which Bors reveals that his children do not even have names, most simply have numbers. In addition, a sex scene between Guinevere and Arthur is shifted to be chronologically before he is informed of the incoming Saxons towards Hadrian's Wall. This seemingly minor change arguably helps the story flow more smoothly. In the original film he is seen in full battle armour, contemplating a broken image of Pelagius on his floor, and then is disturbed by a call to come outside. When he comes outside, he is hastily putting on a shirt, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> is disheveled. In the Director's Cut, after an intimate moment between Arthur and Guinevere explaining Arthur's morals, they carry on into their sexual encounter, and are thus disturbed so that Arthur can be briefed on the Saxons. During the sexual encounter, he is wearing the same outfit he wears during the briefing. The scene where he is examining Pelagius's image is removed.|$|E

25|$|Not {{long after}} he joins the Legion, Superboy's life is {{threatened}} when a Green Kryptonite meteor falls to Earth, but his life is saved by a Smallville farm boy named Lex Luthor, {{who also happens to}} be a science prodigy. The two boys become fast friends, and Superboy builds Lex a fully stocked laboratory to allow him to conduct his experiments. Lex uses the lab to search for a cure for Superboy's weakness to Kryptonite. Just after Lex discovers the cure, a fire breaks out in his lab. When Superboy puts out the fire, the antidote is destroyed, along with a protoplasmic life form that Lex created, and Lex also loses all his hair. Lex blames Superboy for destroying his experiment <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> loss, accusing the Boy of Steel of jealousy over his brilliance. Lex swears that he will prove to the world that he is superior to Superboy. Lex does this by trying to implement a series of scientific quality-of-life improvements for Smallville's residents; however, each invention of Lex's winds up backfiring, requiring Superboy to intervene. This series of setbacks results in Lex dedicating his life to destroying Superboy. In the years that follow, Lex becomes Superboy's (and then Superman's) archfoe. Superboy soon acquires a small rogues gallery of recurring villains, including Lex.|$|E
25|$|In Ikari Warriors, Ralf's attire {{was based}} on Rambo. He wore green pants, a red {{headband}} and a belt full of bullets. In the first game from The King of Fighters series, he wore jeans and a T-shirt, along with a military vest and a red bandanna. In The King of Fighters '99 is sightly changed with green jeans, red gloves {{and he did not}} wear the belt. In The King of Fighters 2000, his outfit is once again modified but with darker colors from all his clothes. His attire from Ikari appears as alternate outfit for the character in the first Maximum Impact game. In , Ralf retains his 2003 outfit but with a red jacket. His Armored Ralf version from the same game {{is very different from the}} original Ralf, as his skin is darker <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> is lighter. He additionally sports a green jacket, military pants, a white T-shirt and a green headband instead of his red bandana. He was also given green protectors in his hands which have spikes. The additional outfits from the common Ralf are cosplays from Marco Rossi from the Metal Slug series and Jack Turner from the Art of Fighting series.In The King of Fighters XII, Ralf becomes bulkier and wears a dark olive military vest over a pair of dark olive cargo pants. His attire in The King of Fighters XIV is a mix of his 99 and XII outfits, with a white tank top and green camouflage cargo pants. His body also sports light green war paint in this.|$|E
500|$|Sideshow Bob's {{first major}} {{appearance}} on The Simpsons {{was in this}} episode, but he {{first appeared in the}} season one episode [...] "The Telltale Head". In that appearance, [...] was more simple <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> was round in shape. However {{near the end of the}} episode he appears with his more familiar hairstyle. Bob's design was updated for [...] "Krusty Gets Busted", and the animators tried to redo his scenes in [...] "The Telltale Head" [...] with the re-design, but did not have enough time. The script for [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] called for James Earl Jones to voice Bob, but the producers instead went with Kelsey Grammer, a cast member on Cheers at the time. Kent Brockman, Judge Snyder, and Scott Christian make their first appearances on The Simpsons in this episode.|$|E

500|$|The special 1-hour 20th anniversary episode where Chrissie killed Den was {{watched by}} 14.34 million {{people on the}} night it was broadcast, {{attracting}} [...] "almost 60% of possible viewers", with a peak share of 57.8%. It was the highest rated episode of EastEnders that year, and has since only been bested by a showing on Christmas Day 2007 (which drew anomalous large audiences for all BBC One programmes that year), and the 25th anniversary episode. However final figures for the broadcast, which factored in digital and recorded viewings, rose to over 17 million making it the highest rated screening of a British soap since 2003. The episode received a massive amount of media interest, and was highly praised for displaying [...] "some of the tightest, funniest dialogue this soap has seen". Oberman revealed {{that she could not}} stop laughing during filming of the scenes, as Grantham's hair was stuck to the floor: [...] "We did lots of takes and poor Leslie was on his back for hours with fake blood all around his head. The liquid dried <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> was glued to the floor. When he got up it ripped his hair out!" ...|$|E
500|$|This set shows a {{stronger}} Toyokuni influence, rather than Sharaku; while basically striving for realism, {{there is an}} idealizing tendency in the rendering of the facial expressions. [...] The prints depict actors in the roles of three brothers from the [...] "Kuruma-biki" [...] episode of the play Sugawara Denju Tenarai Kagami (1796). [...] The scene depicts Umeōmaru and Sakuramaru waiting in ambush for [...] [...] Their brother Matsuōmaru, who is loyal to Shihei, foils their plot.

[...] The Nakamura Noshio II has no seal, and the other two bear the seal [...] "Kabukidō Ga" [...] ( [...] , [...] "drawn by Kabukidō"). [...] The print of Nakamura Noshio II as Sakuramaru depicts the youngest of the three brothers, a romantic character whose symbol is the sakura cherry blossom. [...] The character was sometimes performed by an onnagata, an actor specializing in female roles.|$|E
500|$|One of Olivier's contemporaries at {{the school}} was Peggy Ashcroft, who {{observed}} he was [...] "rather uncouth in that his sleeves were too short <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> stood on end but he was intensely lively and great fun". By his own admission, {{he was not a}} very conscientious student, but Fogerty liked him and later said that he and Ashcroft stood out among her many pupils. On leaving the school after a year, Olivier gained work with small touring companies before being taken on in 1925 by Sybil Thorndike and her husband, Lewis Casson, as a bit-part player, understudy and assistant stage manager for their London company. He modelled his performing style on that of Gerald du Maurier, of whom he said, [...] "He seemed to mutter on stage but had such perfect technique. When I started I was so busy doing a du Maurier that no one ever heard a word I said. The Shakespearean actors one saw were terrible hams like Frank Benson." [...] His concern to speak naturally and avoid what he called [...] "singing" [...] Shakespeare's verse was the cause of much frustration in his early career, with critics regularly decrying his delivery.|$|E

500|$|In 1848, Aqil {{assisted}} {{an expedition}} headed by US Navy captain William Francis Lynch to the Dead Sea, and became {{known in the}} United States and Europe through the publication of Lynch's book that year. Vivid descriptions of Aqil by Lynch are quoted at length {{in the works of}} Finn. Lynch's first encounter with Aqil was in the divan of Said Bey, the Ottoman kaimakam of Acre, and is recorded as follows:But what especially attracted my attention was a magnificent savage enveloped in a scarlet cloth pelisse richly embroidered with gold. He was the handsomest, and I soon thought also the most graceful being I had ever seen. His complexion was of a rich mellow indescribable olive tint, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> a glossy black; his teeth were regular and of the whitest ivory, and the glance of his eye was keen at times, but generally soft and lustrous. With the tarboosh upon his head which he seemed to wear uneasily, he reclined, rather than sat upon {{the opposite side of the}} divân, while his hand played in unconscious familiarity with the hilt of his yataghan. He looked like one who would be 'Steel amid the din of arms, and wax when with the fair.' ...|$|E
500|$|The {{landlord}} of The Plumbers Arms {{described how}} Lady Lucan had entered his bar covered [...] "head to toe in blood" [...] before {{she fell into}} [...] "a state of shock". He claimed that she shouted [...] "Help me, help me, I've just escaped from being murdered" [...] and [...] "My children, my children, he's murdered my nanny". Pathologist Keith Simpson outlined his post-mortem examination, concluding that death was caused by [...] "blunt head injuries" [...] and [...] "inhalation of blood". He confirmed that the lead pipe found at the scene was most likely responsible for Rivett's injuries; some, to the left eye and mouth, he thought {{more likely to have}} been caused by punches from a clenched fist. The last person to confirm seeing Lucan alive, Susan Maxwell-Scott, told the court that the earl looked [...] "dishevelled", <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> [...] "a little ruffled". His trousers had a damp patch on the right hip. Lucan had told her that he was walking, or passing by the house when he saw Veronica being attacked by a man. He let himself in but slipped in a pool of blood at the bottom of the stairs. He told Maxwell-Scott that the attacker ran off, and that Veronica was [...] "very hysterical" [...] and accused him of having hired a hitman to kill her.|$|E
500|$|Nomura {{sought to}} make Cloud's design [...] "distinctly {{different}} from the other characters." [...] About thirty different designs were made for Cloud's face, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> was altered both to give it a more realistic look and to illustrate that two years had passed since the game's conclusion. The staff attempted rendering Cloud based on the game's original illustrations, but concluded that doing so left his eyes unrealistically big, which [...] "looked gross." [...] Further revisions were made to Cloud's face after completion of the pilot film, which featured a more realistic style. In contrast to his hair, Cloud's clothes were difficult to make in the film. Deciding to give Cloud a simple costume consistent with the concept of [...] "clothes designed for action", the staff began {{with the idea of a}} black robe, eventually parring it down to a [...] "long apron" [...] shifted to one side. Cloud's weaponry was based on the joking observation that because his sword in the original game was already enormously tall, in the sequel, he should use sheer numbers. Referred to as [...] "the fusion swords" [...] during the film's development, early storyboard concepts included Cloud carrying six swords on his back, although the idea was later modified to six interlocking swords. While the idea wasn't [...] "logically thought out" [...] and the staff didn't think that they could [...] "make it work physically", it was believed to provide [...] "an interesting accent to the story." [...] Cloud's new motorcycle, , was designed by Takayuki Takeya, who was asked by the staff to design an upgraded version of Cloud's [...] "Hardy-Daytona" [...] motorcycle from Final Fantasy VII. As development continued, the bike got bigger, with Takeya feeling its heaviness provided an impact that worked well within the film.|$|E
