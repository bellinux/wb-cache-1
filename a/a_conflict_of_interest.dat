5|$|There were {{expansion}} {{plans for}} E.H. Hillman to expand services to Paris, Glasgow and Belfast, but operations moved from Romford to Stapleford Aerodrome {{in the mid}} 1930s. <b>A</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> between The Midland & Scottish Air Ferries and Scottish Motor Traction saw services cease in the mid 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Whether {{counsel is}} {{retained}} or appointed, the defendant {{has a right}} to counsel without <b>a</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> If an actual conflict of interest is present, and that conflict results in any adverse effect on the representation, the result is automatic reversal. The general rule is that conflicts can be knowingly and intelligently waived, but some conflicts are un-waiveable.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 60 cases {{were ordered to}} be reviewed. A special {{prosecutor}} was hired because Cook County State's Attorney, Richard Devine, had <b>a</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> stemming from his tenure {{at the law firm}} of Phelan, Pope & John, which had defended Burge in two federal suits. Criminal Courts Judge Paul P. Biebel Jr. presided over the determination of the need of a review to determine the propriety of criminal charges and the appointment of the special prosecutor.|$|E
5|$|Captain Joseph Miceli, {{assigned}} by the Navy to lead the technical investigation into the explosion, had supervised the preparation of powder and shells used in Iowa's 16-inch guns. Thus, according to Thompson, Miceli had <b>a</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in ensuring that the powder, ammunition, or guns were not at fault in the explosion.

5|$|Domitian also heavily prosecuted {{corruption}} among public officials, removing jurors if {{they accepted}} bribes and rescinding legislation when <b>a</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> was suspected. He ensured that libellous writings, especially those directed against himself, were punishable by exile or death. Actors were likewise regarded with suspicion, as their performances {{provided an opportunity}} for satire {{at the expense of}} the government. Consequently, he forbade mimes from appearing on stage in public.|$|E
5|$|Frank then {{met with}} his assistant, N. V. Darley, and Harry Scott of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency, whom Frank hired to help {{investigate}} the case. The Pinkerton detectives investigated many leads, ranging from crime scene evidence to allegations of sexual misconduct {{on the part of}} Frank. The Pinkertons were required to submit duplicates of all evidence to the police, including any that hurt Frank's case. Scott's collaboration with police detective John Black, who from the outset believed in Frank's guilt, resulted in <b>a</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a {{jury found}} for Heffernan and awarded him damages {{from the police}} {{officials}} and the city. Despite the verdict, Heffernan sought a retrial because Judge Peter G. Sheridan had not allowed him to pursue {{the freedom of speech}} claim; the defense did so as well because Judge Sheridan had allowed the freedom of association claim. While considering these motions, Judge Sheridan became aware of <b>a</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> through a former law firm and set aside the verdict, setting a new date for trial before Judge Dennis M. Cavanaugh.|$|E

5|$|Judge Appleby {{eventually}} cut off {{funds for}} any further expert defense testimony. Shakur, in her autobiography, and Williams, in Inadmissible Evidence, both {{claim that it}} was difficult to find expert witnesses for the trial, because of the expense and because most forensic and ballistic specialists declined on the grounds of <b>a</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> when approached because they routinely performed such work for law enforcement officials.|$|E
5|$|Kasab's {{trial was}} delayed due to legal issues, as many Indian lawyers {{were unwilling to}} {{represent}} him.

A lawyer for Kasab was eventually found, but was replaced due to <b>a</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> On 25 February 2009, Indian investigators filed an 11,000-page chargesheet, formally charging Kasab with murder, conspiracy, and waging war against India among other charges.|$|E

5|$|Boyle {{sponsored}} a motion of non-confidence against the government. Despite enjoying {{the support of}} twelve Liberals, including Cushing, the motion was defeated and the government upheld. Rutherford attempted to quell the controversy by calling a royal commission, but pressure from many Liberals, including Bulyea, led him to resign May 26, 1910; he was replaced by Arthur Sifton, hitherto the province's chief judge. In November, the royal commission issued its report. It found that the evidence did not show <b>a</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> on Rutherford's part, but the majority report was nevertheless {{highly critical of the}} former Premier. A minority report was much kinder, avowing perfect satisfaction with Rutherford's version of events.|$|E

5|$|Critics of the ESRB have {{asserted}} that the organization has <b>a</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> because of its {{vested interest in the}} video game industry, and that the ESRB does not rate certain games, such as the Grand Theft Auto series, harshly enough for their violent or sexual content in order to protect their commercial viability. Contrarily, other critics have argued that, at the same time, the ESRB rates certain games too strongly for their content, and that its influence has stifled the viability of adult-oriented video games due to the board's restrictions on how they are marketed and sold.|$|E
5|$|During jury {{selection}} in the United States, attorneys have two options for excluding potential jurors. The first option {{is a challenge}} for cause, in which attorneys must state the reason for a challenge (such as clear bias or <b>a</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest),</b> the opposing party is allowed to respond, and the judge decides whether to exclude the juror. The second option is a peremptory challenge, where an attorney can exclude a juror without stating any reason. While challenges for cause are unlimited, attorneys have {{a limited number of}} peremptory challenges, sometimes as few as four, although 10 is more common in non-capital felony cases.|$|E
5|$|Enron's auditor firm, Arthur Andersen, {{was accused}} of {{applying}} reckless standards in its audits because of <b>a</b> <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> over the significant consulting fees generated by Enron. During 2000, Arthur Andersen earned $25 million in audit fees and $27 million in consulting fees (this amount accounted for roughly 27% of the audit fees of public clients for Arthur Andersen's Houston office). The auditor's methods were questioned as either being completed solely to receive its annual fees or for its lack of expertise in properly reviewing Enron's revenue recognition, special entities, derivatives, and other accounting practices.|$|E
