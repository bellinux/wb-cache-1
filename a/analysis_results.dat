Two dimensional correlation analysis allows one to determine at which positions in such a measured signal there is a systematic change in a peak, either continuous rising or drop in intensity. 2D correlation <b>analysis</b> <b>results</b> in two complementary signals, which referred to as the 2D synchronous and 2D asynchronous spectrum.

The material composite <b>analysis</b> <b>result</b> shows that the implant is made of industrially pure titanium in which the microelements aluminum, calcium and vanadium are on the high sides. The macro <b>analysis</b> <b>result</b> indicates that the implant did not deform remarkably before cracking. The micro <b>analysis</b> <b>result</b> indicates that there is coarse crystalloid fracture in the SEM macrograph, suggesting that the implant material has low fracture strength. The implant fails in mixed cleavage fracture and intergranular fracture accompanied by fatigue fracture in part region, suggesting that the main fracture type was brittle fracture...|$|R
