5000|$|<b>Amurca</b> is the bitter-tasting, dark-colored, watery {{sediment}} that settles out of unfiltered {{olive oil}} over time. It {{is also known as}} [...] "olive oil lees" [...] in English. Historically, <b>amurca</b> was used for numerous purposes, as first described by Cato the Elder in De Agri Cultura, and later by Pliny the Elder. [...] Cato mentions its uses as a building material (128), pesticide (91, 92, 96, 98), herbicide (91, 129), dietary supplement for oxen (103) and trees (36, 93), food preservative (99, 101), as a maintenance product for leather (97), bronze vessel (98), and vases (100), and as a treatment for firewood in order to avoid smoke (130).|$|E
5000|$|The Celtic word first {{passed to}} the Etruscans, who did not {{distinguish}} between the [...] "c" [...] and [...] "g" [...] sounds. Transition through the Etruscans accounts for the Greek amorge being rendered as Latin <b>amurca,</b> Greek κυβερνἂν (kubernân) as Latin gubernare. Perhaps that is how [...] "bragae" [...] became [...] "bracae" [...] and then [...] "braccae".|$|E
50|$|The {{two methods}} of storing dolia were to either bury them half {{way in the}} ground or {{standing}} under a roof. They were used to hold goods such as wine, grape husks, olive oil, <b>amurca,</b> wheat, and other common grains. Many dolia hold record amounts of 40-50 quadrantals (quadrantals being the general amount held in one amphora). Unlike the amphora, the dolium was not regarded as an accessory and sold along with the wine that it contained. Rather, dolia were fixed facilities not employed for the distribution of wine. Its major purpose was for the permanent storage capacity of goods.|$|E
50|$|The {{treatments}} {{are carried out}} by spraying the olive trees with insecticides (dimethoate, deltamethrin, and phosmet). Dimethoate is commonly used for its effectiveness and relatively low cost. It may be preferable because it would leave few residues in olive oil, since it is water-soluble and would pass through the <b>amurca.</b> In the near future, legislative authorization for the withdrawal of use of dimethoate is to be implemented. Among the products with low impact, azadirachtin is a natural repellent extracted from {{the fruits of the}} neem tree. However, its effectiveness against the olive fruit fly has not yet been sufficiently tested. Among the organic insecticide literature, rotenone is also mentioned, but the use of this active ingredient, not readily available, must be authorized by established competent bodies after demonstrating the need for it.|$|E
40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{activity of}} a methanolic extract of <b>amurca</b> (olive oil lees) was determined against both Gram-positive (L. monocytogenes and S. aureus) and Gram-negative (E. coli O 157 :H 7 and S. enteritidis) foodborne pathogens at 10 &# 176;C or 37 &# 176;C using microdilution and disk diffusion methods, and its relative activity {{was compared to}} selected antibiotics. Minimum inhibitory (MIC) and minimum bactericidal (MBC) concentrations of <b>amurca</b> extract ranged from 60 to 80 &# 181;l/ml at 37 &# 176;C after 24 h against all tested strains. At 10 &# 176;C, <b>amurca</b> was more inhibitory with MIC and MBC values of 40 and 60 &# 181;l/ml, respectively, after 7 d against tested strains. <b>Amurca</b> at 40 &# 181;l/ml reduced numbers of tested pathogens by 2. 5 to 3. 2 log 10 CFU/ml at 10 &# 176;C after 7 d, but was not inhibitory at 37 &# 176;C after 24 h. Protein prepared from <b>amurca</b> was not antimicrobial. The relative antimicrobial activity (inhibition zone ratio) of 80 &# 181;l/ml <b>amurca</b> methanolic extract compared to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, gentamycin and tetracycline ranged from 0. 36 to 1. 0 against Gram-negative and from 0. 45 to 2. 0 against Gram-positive bacteria. In addition, <b>amurca</b> extract inhibited E. coli O 157 :H 7 02 - 0628 and S. aureus 26127 which were resistant to tetracycline and chloramphenicol, respectively...|$|E
