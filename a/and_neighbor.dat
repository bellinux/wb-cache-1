5|$|The {{first major}} {{international}} tournament {{in the hall}} was some matches of the 1993 World Women's Handball Championship. Lillehammer IK plays its home matches at Kristins Hall, but in 1995 the play-off match between it <b>and</b> <b>neighbor</b> town rivals Storhamar Dragons was played at Håkons Hall. The match saw more than 5,000 spectators, the record for Lillehammer IK. In 1995, the award ceremony for Spellemannsprisen, Norwegian music's highest award, was held at Håkons Hall.|$|E
5|$|Charles B. Pierce {{was born}} in Hammond, Indiana on June 16, 1938, one of three boys born to Mack McKenny Pierce and Mayven Bryant Pierce. His family moved to the southwestern Arkansas city of Hampton {{when he was just}} a few months old. There he was a {{childhood}} friend <b>and</b> <b>neighbor</b> of future film and television director Harry Thomason, and the two made home movies together in their backyards using an old 8 mm camera.

5|$|In {{addition}} to habitat destruction, the pygmy slow loris is seriously threatened by hunting and trade. Within its geographic range <b>and</b> <b>neighbor</b> countries, {{the trade in}} the pygmy slow loris has recently increased due to economic changes and human population growth, and the trend is expected to continue. Decreased sightings {{in the field and}} at animal markets indicate that wild populations are being depleted since the low reproduction rate of the pygmy slow loris cannot keep pace with these large-scale off-takes. Accordingly, conservationists and field biologists fear local extinctions in the near future. Between 1998 and 2006, 70% of pygmy slow lorises seized by authorities died before reaching a sheltering zoo, resulting in replacement demand and additional captures from the wild.|$|E
5|$|Rusty, a house cat, {{runs into}} a ThunderClan apprentice, Graypaw, {{in the forest}} in his backyard. Rusty, however, does not run away, but fights back. Bluestar and Lionheart, Graypaw's mentor, having watched the confrontation, invite Rusty to join ThunderClan. Rusty asks to think it over, and after talking it over with his best friend <b>and</b> <b>neighbor</b> Smudge, decides {{to go with the}} Clan cats. Lionheart and Whitestorm meet him the next day and lead him to the camp. Due to his house cat past, some members of the Clan are hostile towards Rusty. This hostility {{eventually}} leads Rusty to attack Longtail, losing his collar in the ensuing fight. Bluestar then ends the fight and announces that Rusty has earned his Clan name, Firepaw. He forms a strong bond with Graypaw, and with Ravenpaw, an apprentice to the ambitious warrior Tigerclaw.|$|E
5|$|The Commonwealth's {{struggles with}} the Cossacks were being paid {{attention}} to at Moscow's Kremlin, which from the late 1620s began regarding Cossacks as a potent source of fundamental instability in the Polish–Lithuanian rival <b>and</b> <b>neighbor.</b> Russian efforts to destabilize the Polish Kingdom using Cossacks in the 1630s were not yet successful, even though the Cossack elders themselves often {{raised the possibility of}} a union with the Tsardom to pressure Poland's ruling elites. The borderlands with Russia had become a place of refuge for Cossacks persecuted after their failed uprisings; regiments of Russian-registered Cossacks, following the Commonwealth example, were eventually established there.|$|E

Soon enough, Mike and M.J. learn about the relationship. Jackson makes the sudden announcement that he is moving to nearby Riverton for work and asks Susan to come with him. After much consideration, Susan decides that she is unsure of what she wants and turns down Jackson's offer. Also, Mike moves {{across the street from}} Susan and begins dating her close friend <b>and</b> <b>neighbor,</b> Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany). Realizing she cannot keep Mike from being happy, she gives the couple her blessing, despite still feeling uncomfortable.

With both Susan and Mike employed, M.J. spends more time under Katherine's care, which makes Susan uneasy. She is heartbroken to learn that Mike and Katherine have decided to move in with one another and become engaged.|$|E

25|$|Milius and Lubell {{remained}} {{members of}} the Communist Party of the United States of America until they either were forced to leave (Cecil Lubell) or left {{of their own accord}} after the Kruschov speech of 1956 (Winifred), but nonetheless they and their family were affected by the Red Scare Cold War policies. In 1956, Cecil Lubell was subpoenaed by the Internal Security Subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee chaired by Senator James O. Eastland to testify against friend <b>and</b> <b>neighbor</b> Joseph North. Lubell did not incriminate his friend <b>and</b> <b>neighbor,</b> denying any knowledge of North and his involvement within the Communist Party. During this time, Milius began illustrating more books. She co-created, with Lubell, a series of children's books about animals, natural history, plants and ecosystems.|$|E

25|$|Gleason's {{most popular}} {{character}} by far was blustery bus driver Ralph Kramden. Largely drawn from Gleason's harsh Brooklyn childhood, these sketches {{became known as}} The Honeymooners. The show was based on Ralph's many get-rich-quick schemes, his ambition, antics with his best friend <b>and</b> <b>neighbor,</b> scatterbrained sewer worker Ed Norton, and clashes with sensible wife Alice, who typically pulled Ralph's head down from the clouds.|$|E
25|$|Not {{known for}} his oratory (but for quiet sardonic wit), bishop White earned Philadelphians' esteem for his erudition and ongoing {{charitable}} works, especially during the multiple outbreaks of yellow fever in that city throughout the 1790s.

25|$|De Santibañes was {{appointed}} Secretary of Intelligence by his close friend <b>and</b> <b>neighbor,</b> the newly inaugurated President Fernando de la Rúa. His tenure was shaken {{in its early}} days by the suicide in January 2000 of María Teresa Toledo, {{an employee of the}} SIDE Architectural Bureau who jumped from a 10th floor window at SIDE headquarters. Discontent at the agency intensified when de Santibañes had 1,200 SIDE personnel fired, drastically reducing the agency's operational capabilities.|$|E

To get out of his contract with Porsche Salzburg, Herrmann had to recommend a replacement driver to Luise Piech.|$|E
