50|$|The estimations for {{the needed}} {{financing}} for climate change {{vary according to}} the geographic, sectorial and activity coverage, timescale and phasing, target and the underlying assumptions. The 2010 the World Development Report preliminary estimates of financing needs for mitigation and adaptation activities in developing countries range from USD 140-175 billion per year for mitigation over the next 20 years with <b>associated</b> <b>financing</b> needs of USD 265-565 billion and USD30 - 100 billion a year over the period 2010 - 2050 for adaptation.The International Energy Agency’s 2011 World Energy Outlook (WEO) estimates that in order to meet growing demand for energy through 2035, USD 16.9 trillion in new investment for new power generation is projected, with renewable energy (RE) comprising 60% of the total. The capital required to meet projected energy demand through 2030 amounts to $1.1 trillion per year on average, distributed (almost evenly) between the large emerging economies (China, India, Brazil, etc.) and including the remaining developing countries.|$|E
5000|$|One {{critique}} here, is {{that model}} outputs, i.e. line items, often incorporate “unrealistic implicit assumptions” and “internal inconsistencies”. (For example, a forecast for growth in revenue but without corresponding increases in working capital, fixed assets and the <b>associated</b> <b>financing,</b> may imbed unrealistic assumptions about asset turnover, leverage and / or equity financing.) What is required, but often lacking, {{is that all}} key elements are explicitly and consistently forecasted. Related to this, is that modellers often additionally [...] "fail to identify crucial assumptions" [...] relating to inputs, [...] "and to explore what can go wrong". Here, in general, modellers [...] "use point values and simple arithmetic instead of probability distributions and statistical measures" [...] — i.e., as mentioned, the problems are treated as deterministic in nature — and thus calculate a single value for the asset or project, but without providing information on the range, variance and sensitivity of outcomes. Other critiques discuss the lack of adequate spreadsheet design skills, and of basic computer programming concepts.

Allocative efficiency, a notion that has figured prominently in the economics literature about the merits of decentralization, is shown to have limited value once we accept the existence of externalities and public goods in the provision of basic services. The review of available evidence for Asian and transition countries suggests that there is a significant risk that equity can be adversely affected by the decentralization of education and the <b>associated</b> <b>financing</b> arrangements. access to basic services; child welfare; decentralization; economic transition; equal opportunities;Central Asia; Central Europe; Eastern Europe;...|$|E

40|$|Many academics, largely {{scientists}} and engineers but also social {{scientists and}} management researchers, find that they need more compute power than is provided “on their desk”. If a machine twice as fast is required, then buying one is generally feasible, but this approach rapidly runs into the buffers of price, power consumption, air (or water!) cooling, and sheer availability.

40|$|Determining future {{transport}} infrastructure needs is traditionally {{the first stage}} in the investment planning process. However, this process generally takes place {{within the framework of}} national transport policy, even in cases where the infrastructure is used for international traffic flows. This report proposes to address this issue by considering the specific needs of international traffic flows with regard to inland modes of transport. Obviously, these issues will be shaped by the way in which traffic flows develop over the next few decades, since new infrastructure needs and the <b>associated</b> <b>financing</b> problems clearly depend on the pace and scale of such growth. This uncertainty would be dispelled if growth were to remain zero or very close to zero. In the opposite case, namely if average growth rates were to be higher than 1. 5 % to 2 % in European countries, growth in traffic raises the issue of the so-called decoupling of transport from economic growth. We must therefore begin by dispelling these uncertainties regarding a possible decoupling, or at least by stating the assumptions underlying the situation in which we find ourselves.

However, concerns over escalating costs in jurisdictions with FIT policies have led to increased attention on cost control in renewable energy policy design. In recent years, policy mechanisms for containing FIT costs have become more refined, allowing policymakers to exert greater control on policy outcomes and on the resulting costs to ratepayers. As policymakers and regulators in the United States begin to explore the use of FITs, careful consideration must be given {{to the ways in which}} policy design can be used to balance the policies' advantages while bounding its costs. This report explores mechanisms that policymakers have implemented to limit FIT policy costs. If designed clearly and transparently, such mechanisms can align policymaker and market expectations for project deployment. Three different policy tools are evaluated: (1) caps, (2) payment level adjustment mechanisms, and (3) auction-based designs. The report employs case studies to explore the strengths and weaknesses of these three cost containment tools. These tools are then evaluated with a set of criteria including predictability for policymakers and the marketplace and the potential for unintended consequences...|$|E

40|$|Malaria draws global {{attention}} in a cyclic manner, with interest and <b>associated</b> <b>financing</b> waxing and waning according to political and humanitarian concerns. Currently {{we are on}} an upswing, which should be carefully developed. Malaria parasites have been eliminated from Europe and North America {{through the use of}} residual insecticides and manipulation of environmental and ecological characteristics; however, in many tropical and some temperate areas the incidence of disease is increasing dramatically. Much of this increase results from a breakdown of effective control methods developed and implemented in the 1960 s, but it has also occurred {{because of a lack of}} trained scientists and control specialists who live and work in the areas of endemic infection. Add to this the widespread resistance to the most effective antimalarial drug, chloroquine, developing resistance to other first-line drugs such as sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, and resistance of certain vector species of mosquito to some of the previously effective insecticides and we have a crisis situation. Vaccine research has proceeded for over 30 years, but as yet there is no effective product, although research continues in many promising areas. A global strategy for malaria control has been accepted, but there are critics who suggest that the single strategy cannot confront the wide range of conditions in which malaria exists and that reliance on chemotherapy without proper control of drug usage and diagnosis will select for drug resistant parasites, thus exacerbating the problem. An integrated approach to control using vector control strategies based on the biology of the mosquito, the epidemiology of the parasite, and human behavior patterns is needed to prevent continued upsurge in malaria in the endemic areas...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is an {{analysis}} of the evolution of the retirement and pension system in the Czech Republic since 1993 up to the present time, with focus on law reform provisions and <b>associated</b> <b>financing</b> methods, applied legislative and institutional framework and encumbrance of public budgets. Many European countries have already performed reformation of their pension systems, the reason mostly being demographic changes and unsustainability of pension financing solely from public budgets. This topic is becoming relevant also in the Czech Republic in view of the II. pillar pension savings introduced {{in the beginning of the}} previous year. Nevertheless, this will apparently not be the last step in the context of pension reforms given the unexpectedly low number of participants in the pillar. Overburdening of the public budgets and insufficient provisioning of elder population thus still remain some of the capital problems of the Czech Republic. In the theoretical part we first characterize the theory of public budgets and sketch the significance of the cash flow itself. Next we will define the meaning of retirement and pension systems, their classification according to the type of financing and operation and their respective advantages and disadvantages. We will also determine the main factors influencing the form of these systems. In the practical part we carry out the analysis of the retirement and pension system in the Czech Republic, structured into several time intervals delimited by the effected reform provisions since 1993 until the present. We investigate each of these stages separately, focusing mainly on financing methods and the impact on the public budgets; and further from the point of view of the legislative and institutional frameworks. Finally we will assess the effectiveness of the reform provisions and their impact on the provisioning of elders and the public budgets...|$|E
