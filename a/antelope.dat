5|$|A herbivore, {{the royal}} <b>antelope</b> prefers small {{quantities}} of fresh foliage and shoots; fruits and fungi {{may be taken}} occasionally. Though the <b>antelope</b> {{is considered to be}} nocturnal, zoologist Jonathan Kingdon holds that feeding occurs throughout the day, though some foraging may also be observed at night. In comparison to Bates's pygmy <b>antelope,</b> the royal <b>antelope</b> has a longer muzzle, broader lips, a smaller mouth and smaller cheek muscles. These features do not allow complete digestion of lignified growth. Individuals may often move into new locations foraging for fresh growth.|$|E
5|$|The four-horned <b>antelope</b> differs {{greatly from}} the nilgai in colour, {{is much smaller}} and has an extra pair of horns. The nilgai is nearly nine times heavier and two times taller than the four-horned <b>antelope.</b> Two deer species, the Indian muntjac and the hog deer, can be {{confused}} with this <b>antelope.</b> The four-horned <b>antelope,</b> however, lacks their antlers. The chinkara, a gazelle, can be told apart by its light brown coat and larger, ringed horns.|$|E
5|$|The four-horned <b>antelope</b> {{feeds on}} grasses, herbs, shrubs, foliage, flowers and fruits. A study in Mudumalai National Park (Tamil Nadu, India) {{showed that the}} <b>antelope</b> prefers grass species of the family Cyperaceae; genera Axonopus, Cynodon, Digitaria, Echinochloa, Panicum, Sehima and Sporobolus; and the species Imperata cylindrica, Ottochloa nodosa, Pseudanthistria umbellata and Themeda cymbaria. The shrub Grewia hirsuta is {{frequently}} eaten. Preferred herbs include Helichrysum, Indigofera and Tinospora species and Leucas aspera. The four-horned <b>antelope</b> feeds on the leaves of trees such as Cordia wallichii, Emblica officinalis, Randia dumetorum and Zizyphus xylopyrus. Grasses comprise nearly 29 percent of the diet, followed by foliage from trees (nearly nine percent). Grass and browse were consumed in nearly equal proportions. A study in the Panna National Park (Madhya Pradesh, India) showed preference for Zizyphus mauritiana, Acacia nilotica, A. leucophloea and A. catechu. Babool flowers were frequently eaten. The <b>antelope</b> often associates with langurs under fruiting trees, just as chital frequently do. Interaction with chital, a sympatric species, was infrequent. The <b>antelope</b> is wary when feeding, often raising its head and looking about its vicinity. The four-horned <b>antelope</b> needs to drink water frequently; as such it stays in places near water sources.|$|E
50|$|The 2013-14 Grand Canyon <b>Antelopes</b> women's {{basketball}} team represented Grand Canyon University during the 2013-14 college basketball season. It was head coach Trent May's seventh season at Grand Canyon. The <b>Antelopes</b> competed as {{new members of}} the Western Athletic Conference and played their home games at GCU Arena. This was year 1 of a four-year transition period from D2 to Division I. As a result, the <b>Antelopes</b> were classified as a D2 team for the 2013-14 season. The <b>Antelopes</b> weren't eligible to make the D1 or D2 basketball tournaments and {{did not participate in}} this season's WAC basketball tournament. However the <b>Antelopes</b> could have competed in the WNIT or WBI tournaments if they were invited. The <b>Antelopes</b> finished the season third in the WAC and were {{invited to participate in the}} WBI.|$|R
5000|$|Those forests {{were filled}} of <b>antelopes</b> {{as a major}} animal. And as hunters and fishermen, they began to {{identify}} the forests with <b>antelopes.</b> At the mouth or shore of Njaba River, they encounter young or siblings of <b>antelopes</b> and they name the river mouth and its close forest as [...] "Umu-ele" [...] which means [...] "siblings of antelopes".|$|R
50|$|After {{graduating in}} 2011, Mori joined the Toyota <b>Antelopes</b> in the WJBL, helping them finish second {{in both the}} 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 seasons. The <b>Antelopes</b> won their first Empress's Cup in 2013.|$|R
5|$|The four-horned <b>antelope</b> is {{the sole}} member of the genus Tetracerus, and is placed under the family Bovidae. The species was first {{described}} by French zoologist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1816. The four-horned <b>antelope</b> has only one other relative in the tribe Boselaphini, the nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus). The Boselaphini have the horns with a keel {{on the front and}} lack rings as found in other <b>antelope</b> groups.|$|E
5|$|Typically nocturnal (active at night), {{the royal}} <b>antelope</b> {{exhibits}} remarkable alertness. Territories are marked with dung. A herbivore, the royal <b>antelope</b> prefers small quantities of fresh foliage and shoots; fruits and fungi {{may be taken}} occasionally. Like other neotragines, the royal <b>antelope</b> is monogamous. Both sexes can become sexually mature by as early as six months. Births {{have been reported in}} November and December. A single, delicate young is born after an unknown gestational period.|$|E
5|$|Four-horned antelopes tend {{to inhabit}} areas with {{significant}} grass cover or heavy undergrowth, and avoid human settlements. Earlier common throughout deciduous forests in India, the <b>antelope</b> now occurs in widely disjunct, small populations. Most of the populations are in India, and lower numbers {{can be found}} in adjoining Nepal. The four-horned <b>antelope</b> is threatened by the loss of its natural habitat due to agricultural expansion. Moreover, the unusual four-horned skull and the horns have been a popular target for trophy hunters. The four-horned <b>antelope</b> is classified as Vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN).|$|E
50|$|Other {{wildlife}} includes elephants, buffaloes, roan <b>antelopes,</b> kob <b>antelopes</b> and warthogs. The West African giraffe {{is currently}} {{not found in}} the W National Park, but further north in Niger, where it has its last relict population.|$|R
5000|$|The Antilopinae are a {{subfamily}} of Bovidae. The gazelles, blackbucks, springboks, gerenuks, dibatags, and Central Asian gazelles {{are often}} referred to as [...] "true antelopes", and are usually classified as the only representatives of the Antilopinae. True <b>antelopes</b> occur in much of Africa and Asia, with the highest concentration of species occurring in East Africa in Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya, and Tanzania. The saigas and Tibetan <b>antelopes</b> are related to true <b>antelopes</b> (Antilopinae) and goats (Caprinae), but often placed in their own subfamily, Saiginae. These animals inhabit much of central and western Asia. The dwarf <b>antelopes</b> are sometimes placed in a separate subfamily, Neotraginae, and live entirely in sub-Saharan Africa.|$|R
50|$|The zoo houses two {{elephants}} {{given to}} the king of Sweden by Thailand. Kolmården Wildlife Park has the only gorillas, bottle-nosed dolphins, bush dogs, addax <b>antelopes,</b> oryx <b>antelopes,</b> Asian elephants, takin, Grévy's zebras, dholes, and ibex in Sweden.|$|R

5|$|Several {{proposals}} {{have been made}} to bypass the <b>Antelope</b> Valley Freeway by boring a tunnel under the San Gabriel Mountains and extending the Glendale Freeway through it to the <b>Antelope</b> Valley. In 2003, Caltrans published a map showing potential improvements to the transportation infrastructure of southern California. The proposal showed both the unconstructed portion of Route 14 and new routes over or under the mountains to <b>Antelope</b> Valley. In 2005, the idea was advanced as a combination toll tunnel and surface highway. Preliminary studies estimated costs around $3 billion and suggested charging a varying toll, adjusted for the time of day, averaging around $8 for one-way passage.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Antelopes</b> with Six Legs : According to Siberian myth, these six-legged <b>antelopes</b> {{were far}} {{too fast for}} human beings to catch. A divine huntsman, Tunk-poj, cut off the animal's rear-most legs to make the animal easier for humans to hunt.|$|R
50|$|The {{subfamily}} Reduncinae {{is composed}} of nine species of <b>antelopes,</b> all of which dwell in marshes, floodplains, or other well-watered areas, including the waterbucks and reedbucks. These <b>antelopes</b> first appeared in fossil record 7.4 million years ago (Mya) in Eurasia and 6.6 Mya in Africa.|$|R
50|$|The fauna is diverse. The grasses, {{shrubs and}} trees sustain many large mammals {{including}} black rhinos, buffalo, elephants, and <b>antelopes</b> such as elands, sable <b>antelopes,</b> roan <b>antelopes,</b> Lichtenstein's hartebeests, and the swamp-dwelling <b>antelopes.</b> Large carnivores include lion (Panthera leo), leopard (Panthera pardus), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) and side-striped jackal (Canis adustus). There are also many primates in the woodlands, {{particularly in the}} Congo and Uganda, including yellow baboons and chimpanzees. Indeed, the famous Gombe Stream National Park chimpanzee reserve is in this ecoregion. The only endemic mammals are Monard's dormouse (Graphiurus monardi), another mouse, Rosevear's lemniscomys (Lemniscomys roseveari), Ansell's shrew (Crocidura ansellorum) and the Upemba shrew (Crocidura zimmeri).|$|R
5|$|The four-horned <b>antelope</b> is diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day), though it mainly rests or ruminates in dense {{undergrowth}} at noon. Though solitary by nature, the four-horned <b>antelope</b> may form loose {{groups of three}} to five. Groups consist {{of one or more}} adults, sometimes accompanied by juveniles. Males and females hardly interact, except in the mating season.|$|E
5|$|The four-horned <b>antelope</b> is diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day). Though solitary by nature, four-horned antelopes may form loose {{groups of three}} to five –with one or more adults, {{sometimes}} accompanied by juveniles. This elusive <b>antelope</b> feeds on grasses, herbs, shrubs, foliage, flowers and fruits. It needs to drink water frequently; as such it stays in places near water sources. The breeding behaviour of the four-horned <b>antelope</b> has not been well studied. The age at which they reach sexual maturity and the season when mating occurs have not been understood well. Gestation lasts about eight months, following which one or two calves are born. They are kept concealed {{for the first few}} weeks of their birth. The young remain with the mother for about a year.|$|E
5|$|The royal <b>antelope</b> {{has been}} {{categorised}} as Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). In 1999, Rod East of the IUCN SSC <b>Antelope</b> Specialist Group estimated {{the total population}} to be about 62,000, however {{this is likely to}} be an underestimate. The populations are feared to be declining due to habitat deterioration and expanding human settlement. A significant threat to the survival of this <b>antelope</b> is hunting for bushmeat; it is seldom hunted in Sierra Leone and Liberia, whereas it is a major source of bushmeat in Côte d'Ivoire. Protected areas where the royal <b>antelope</b> occurs include the Tai National Park, Haut Bandama Fauna and Flora Reserve and Mabi-Yaya Classified Forest (Côte d'Ivoire); Kakum National Park and Assin-Attandanso Game Production Reserve (Ghana); Ziama and Diecke Forest Reserves (Guinea); Tiwai Island and Gola Rainforest National Park (Sierra Leone).|$|E

This was year 3 of a 4-year transition period from D2 to D1. As a result, the <b>Antelopes</b> wasn't eligible to make the D1 or D2 Basketball Tournaments and will not participate in this season's WAC Basketball Tournament. However the <b>Antelopes</b> did compete in the WBI where they lost in the first round to North Dakota. They finished the season 16-15, 8-6 in WAC play to finish in a 3 tie for third place.|$|R
50|$|Middens {{created by}} <b>antelopes,</b> {{as well as}} other herbivores, play an {{important}} role by providing nutrients to certain areas of land. It has been described that duiker and steenbok <b>antelopes</b> defecate in exposed sites, generally on sandy soil, thus enriching the nutrient-deficient areas, as well as depositing plant seed there.|$|R

5|$|The royal <b>antelope</b> prefers {{areas with}} fresh and dense growth of shrubs and other plants. It inhabits the warm, moist lowland forests {{prevalent}} in western African {{countries such as}} Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The royal <b>antelope</b> has been categorised as Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN).

5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} royal <b>antelope</b> is Neotragus pygmaeus. It {{is placed in the}} genus Neotragus and the family Bovidae. It was first described by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae (1758). German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas recognised two species – Tragulus pygmaeus and Antilope pygmaea. However, both of them were found to have the same type, the royal <b>antelope.</b> Hence these were treated as synonyms for N. pygmaeus.|$|E
5|$|The tribe Neotragini {{comprises}} {{a variety}} of dwarf antelopes apart from Neotragus – these include Dorcatragus (beira), Ourebia (oribi), Madoqua (dik dik), Oreotragus (klipspringer) and Raphicerus. The tribe {{has been shown to}} be paraphyletic. A 2014 phylogenetic analysis based on cytochrome b sequences and linear skull measurements showed polyphyly in Neotragus. The royal <b>antelope</b> is not closely related to the other two species in its genus – suni (N. moschatus) and Bates's pygmy <b>antelope</b> (N. batesi). The latter two are closely related, while the royal <b>antelope</b> is likely to have had an ancestor in common with the klipspringer and duikers (subfamily Cephalophinae).|$|E
