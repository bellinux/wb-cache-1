40|$|The {{present study}} proposes a <b>robot</b> <b>arm</b> that can support precise {{positioning}} in operation by a human. The <b>robot</b> <b>arm</b> has passive and actuated joints. The passive joint is not mechanically constrained and can move passively with {{the motion of}} the output point of the <b>robot</b> <b>arm.</b> Therefore, a human can move the output point of the <b>robot</b> <b>arm</b> by his will. When a human tries to move the output point along an object path, the displacement of the passive joint is determined passively. Then, if the actuated joint is controlled so that the output point may be on the object path, the human can achieve precise positioning. Namely, using the proposed <b>robot</b> <b>arm,</b> the human can adjust the velocity, acceleration, applied force and so on by his will, while the position is preciously compensated by the actuated joint.
