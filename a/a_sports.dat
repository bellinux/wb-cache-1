40|$|The {{primary goal}} {{of the current study}} was to extend {{previous}} research suggesting that coaches are the primary gatekeepers who may be a barrier to working with athletes by examining high school coaches likelihood to refer to, interest in, and intention to hire <b>a</b> <b>sport</b> psychologist. Specifically, the current study examined relationships between high school coaches’ sex, age, and type of sport coached (i. e., contact vs. non-contact) and their likelihood to refer athletes to <b>a</b> <b>sport</b> psychologist for <b>a</b> variety of presenting issues (i. e., poor attentional focus, poor leadership, family issues, etc.). It also examined relationships between coaches’ sex, age, and type of sport coached (i. e., contact vs. non-contact) and their interest in working with <b>a</b> <b>sport</b> psychologist. Finally, the study examined reasons why coaches did not plan to hire <b>a</b> <b>sport</b> psychologist. An examination of the possible reasons that high school coaches do not plan to hire <b>a</b> <b>sport</b> psychologist served <b>an</b> exploratory purpose. Participants included 450 coaches who coached high school sports in the United States. Results indicated that female coaches and non-contact sport coaches were more likely to refer athletes to <b>a</b> <b>sport</b> psychologist for <b>a</b> variety of referral issues than male coaches and coaches of contact sports. Similarly, significantly more female coaches and non-contact sport coaches showed interest in working with <b>a</b> <b>sport</b> psychologist than male coaches and coaches of contact sports. Coaches who did not plan to hire <b>a</b> <b>sport</b> psychologist reported that cost, lack authority to hire, and lack of availability as primary reasons. Implications of the findings, limitations, and future directions are discussed...|$|R
