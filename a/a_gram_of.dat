5|$|Production of the fissile {{isotopes}} uranium-235 and plutonium-239 were enormous undertakings {{given the}} technology of the 1940s, and accounted for 80% of the total costs of the project. Uranium enrichment was carried out at the Clinton Engineer Works near Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Theoretically, enriching uranium was feasible through pre-existing techniques, but it proved difficult to scale to industrial levels and was extremely costly. Only 0.71 percent of natural uranium was uranium-235, and {{it was estimated that}} it would take 27,000 years to produce <b>a</b> <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> uranium with mass spectrometers, but kilogram amounts were required.|$|E
5|$|To {{prove their}} discoveries beyond any doubt, the Curies sought to isolate {{polonium}} and radium in pure form. Pitchblende {{is a complex}} mineral; the chemical separation of its constituents was an arduous task. The discovery of polonium had been relatively easy; chemically it resembles the element bismuth, and polonium was the only bismuth-like substance in the ore. Radium, however, was more elusive; it is closely related chemically to barium, and pitchblende contains both elements. By 1898 the Curies had obtained traces of radium, but appreciable quantities, uncontaminated with barium, were still beyond reach. The Curies undertook the arduous task of separating out radium salt by differential crystallization. From a ton of pitchblende, one-tenth of <b>a</b> <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> radium chloride was separated in 1902. In 1910, she isolated pure radium metal. She never succeeded in isolating polonium, which has a half-life of only 138 days.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} {{naturally}} occurring isotopes of carbon on Earth: 99% {{of the carbon}} is carbon-12, 1% is carbon-13, and carbon-14 occurs in trace amounts, i.e., making up about 1 or 1.5 atoms per 1012 atoms of the carbon in the atmosphere. Carbon-12 and carbon-13 are both stable, while the half-life of carbon-14 is 5,730±40 years. Carbon-14 decays into nitrogen-14 through beta decay. <b>A</b> <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> carbon containing 1 atom of carbon-14 per 1012 atoms will emit 0.2 beta particles per second.

25|$|All {{isotopes}} of radium have half-lives {{much shorter}} than {{the age of the}} Earth, so that any primordial radium would have decayed long ago. Radium nevertheless still occurs in the environment, as the isotopes 223Ra, 224Ra, 226Ra, and 228Ra are part of the decay chains of natural thorium and uranium isotopes; since thorium and uranium have very long half-lives, these daughters are continually being regenerated by their decay. Of these four isotopes, the longest-lived is 226Ra (half-life 1600years), a decay product of natural uranium. Because of its relative longevity, 226Ra is the most common isotope of the element, making up about one part per trillion of the Earth's crust; essentially all natural radium is 226Ra. Thus, radium is found in tiny quantities in the uranium ore uraninite and various other uranium minerals, and in even tinier quantities in thorium minerals. One ton of pitchblende typically yields about one seventh of <b>a</b> <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> radium. One kilogram of the Earth's crust contains about 900picograms of radium, and one liter of sea water contains about 89femtograms of radium.|$|E
25|$|Sedative-hypnotics such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, and the {{barbiturates}} {{are known}} for the severe physical dependence that {{they are capable of}} inducing which can result in severe withdrawal effects. This severe neuroadaptation is even more profound in high dose drug users and misusers. A high degree of tolerance often occurs in chronic benzodiazepine abusers due to the typically high doses they consume which can lead to a severe benzodiazepine dependence. The benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome seen in chronic high dose benzodiazepine abusers is similar to that seen in therapeutic low dose users but of a more severe nature. Extreme antisocial behaviors in obtaining continued supplies and severe drug-seeking behavior when withdrawals occur. The severity of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome has been described by one benzodiazepine drug misuser who stated that I'd rather withdraw off heroin any day. If I was withdrawing from benzos you could offer me <b>a</b> <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> heroin or just 20mg of diazepam and I'd take the diazepam every time– I've never been so frightened in my life. Those who use benzodiazepines intermittently are less likely to develop a dependence and withdrawal symptoms upon dose reduction or cessation of benzodiazepines than those who use benzodiazepines on a daily basis.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the rare natural occurrence, bulk quantities of technetium-99 are produced each year from spent nuclear fuel rods, which contain various fission products. The fission of <b>a</b> <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> uranium-235 in nuclear reactors yields 27mg of technetium-99, giving technetium a fission product yield of 6.1%. Other fissile isotopes produce similar yields of technetium, such as 4.9% from uranium-233 and 6.21% from plutonium-239. [...] An estimated 49,000TBq (78metric tons) of technetium was produced in nuclear reactors between 1983 and 1994, by far the dominant source of terrestrial technetium. Only {{a fraction of the}} production is used commercially.|$|E
500|$|Water {{and carbon}} dioxide are {{metabolic}} end products of oxidation of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. Oxidising <b>a</b> <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> carbohydrate produces 0.60 grams of water; <b>a</b> <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> protein produces 0.41 grams of water; and <b>a</b> <b>gram</b> <b>of</b> fat produces 1.07 grams of water, {{making it possible for}} xerocoles to live with little or no access to drinking water. The kangaroo rat for example makes use of this water of metabolism and conserves water both by having a low basal metabolic rate and by remaining underground during the heat of the day, reducing loss of water through its skin and respiratory system when at rest. Herbivorous mammals obtain moisture from the plants they eat. Species such as the addax antelope, dik-dik, Grant's gazelle and oryx are so efficient at doing this that they apparently never need to drink. The camel is a superb example of a mammal adapted to desert life. It minimizes its water loss by producing concentrated urine and dry dung, and is able to lose 40% of its body weight through water loss without dying of dehydration. Carnivores can obtain much of their water needs from the body fluids of their prey. Many other hot desert animals are nocturnal, seeking out shade during the day or dwelling underground in burrows. At depths of more than [...] , these remain at between [...] regardless of the external temperature. Jerboas, desert rats, kangaroo rats and other small rodents emerge from their burrows at night and so do the foxes, coyotes, jackals and snakes that prey on them. Kangaroos keep cool by increasing their respiration rate, panting, sweating and moistening the skin of their forelegs with saliva. Mammals living in cold deserts have developed greater insulation through warmer body fur and insulating layers of fat beneath the skin. The arctic weasel has a metabolic rate that is two or three times as high as would be expected for an animal of its size. Birds have avoided the problem of losing heat through their feet by not attempting to maintain them at the same temperature as the rest of their bodies, a form of adaptive insulation. The emperor penguin has dense plumage, a downy under layer, an air insulation layer next the skin and various thermoregulatory strategies to maintain its body temperature in one of the harshest environments on Earth.|$|E
