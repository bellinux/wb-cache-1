5|$|In 2007, {{a review}} of all well-preserved {{specimens}} including the then-newly discovered Thermopolis specimen concluded that two distinct species of Archaeopteryx could be supported: A. lithographica (consisting of <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>the</b> London and Solnhofen specimens), and A. siemensii (consisting of <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>the</b> Berlin, Munich, and Thermopolis specimens). The two species are distinguished primarily by large flexor tubercles on the foot claws in A. lithographica (the claws of A. siemensii specimens being relatively simple and straight). A. lithographica also had a constricted portion of the crown in some teeth and a stouter metatarsus. A supposed additional species, Wellnhoferia grandis (based on the Solnhofen specimen), seems to be indistinguishable from A. lithographica except in its larger size.|$|E
