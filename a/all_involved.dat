5|$|After the Jacobite rising of 1745, Adam's {{position}} as Mason to the Board of Ordnance {{brought him a}} number of large military contracts in the Highlands. In 1746, the position of Master Carpenter to the Board of Ordnance became vacant, and Adam was quick to put forward his son John's name for consideration, although he was unsuccessful in securing him the post. His three eldest sons were <b>all</b> <b>involved</b> in the family business by 1746, James and John both leaving Edinburgh University early to join their father.|$|E
5|$|TNA {{held the}} first ever Monster's Ball match, {{featuring}} Monty Brown, Abyss, and Raven, at Victory Road. There were no disqualifications and pinfalls and submissions were counted anywhere in this match. Brown, Abyss, and Raven were <b>all</b> <b>involved</b> in a tournament to challenge Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at Victory Road which set up a rivalry between the three. On the October 29 episode of Impact!, Raven challenged Brown and Abyss to a Monsters Ball match at Victory Road, which was later booked for the event without Brown nor Abyss accepting the challenge.|$|E
5|$|Taft and his Secretary of State, Philander Knox, {{instituted a}} policy of Dollar Diplomacy towards Latin America, believing U.S. {{investment}} would benefit <b>all</b> <b>involved,</b> while diminishing European influence in regions where the Monroe Doctrine applied. The policy was unpopular among Latin American states that {{did not wish to}} become financial protectorates of the United States, {{as well as in the}} U.S. Senate, many of whose members believed the U.S. should not interfere abroad. No foreign affairs controversy tested Taft's policy more than the collapse of the Mexican regime and subsequent turmoil of the Mexican Revolution.|$|E

5|$|Fonseca chose both. First, the Brazilian Congress began {{negotiating}} with the mutineers, although this was not Fonseca's preferred solution—he and the Minister of the Navy Marques Leão began plotting a military solution. At the behest of Congress, José Carlos de Carvalho was appointed as a liaison to the rebels. Carvalho, a federal deputy and former naval captain, talked with the crew on all four ships and reported to Congress that the rebels were well led and organized—and their main armament was fully functional. His report showed that the sailor's complaints, especially about the lash, were well-justified and that a military option {{would be unlikely to}} succeed. By the afternoon on 23 November, the Brazilian Congress had begun work on a bill that would grant amnesty to <b>all</b> <b>involved</b> and end the use of corporal punishment in the navy.|$|E
5|$|Gil Stein, {{president}} of the NHL, indicated that the league would not take disciplinary action against Aubut, and the Rangers did not challenge the arbitrator's decision. Stein further stated that as of August 1, all trades needed to be confirmed with the league office by <b>all</b> <b>involved</b> parties before they would be considered consummated. Lindros signed a five-year contract with the Flyers worth an estimated $24million. As a rookie, he earned $2million, while Gretzky, with the largest NHL contract, earned $3million. Lindros did not accompany the Flyers to Quebec for an exhibition game prior to the 1992–93 season due to concern about the reception he would receive. Hextall and Ricci initially {{did not want to}} report to Quebec, but relented.|$|E
5|$|On 31 July 1941, Hermann Göring gave written {{authorization}} to Heydrich, Chief of the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA), {{to prepare and}} submit a plan for Die Endlösung der Judenfrage (the Final Solution of the Jewish question) in territories under German control and to coordinate the participation of <b>all</b> <b>involved</b> government organizations. The resulting Generalplan Ost (General Plan for the East) called for deporting the population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, for use as slave labor or to be murdered. In addition to eliminating Jews, the Nazis also planned to reduce {{the population of the}} conquered territories by 30 million people through starvation in an action called the Hunger Plan. Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians. Cities would be razed and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by German colonists.|$|E

5|$|Producer Ekta Kapoor {{promoted}} the film's second trailer, buying prime-time (8 to 11 pm) slots on four television channels. She also spent 20million rupees for a slot on a leading channel for a promotion for the film. Askhay Kumar, Sonakshi Sinha and Imran Khan (the three leads) {{promoted the}} film on Comedy Nights with Kapil, hosted by Kapil Sharma. Kumar, Sinha, Khan, Kapoor {{and most of}} the other cast and crew visited the Dargah Sharif (a shrine to the Sufi saint Moinuddin Chishti in Ajmer) on Monday morning, 5 August, to pray for the film's success and the well-being of <b>all</b> <b>involved.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Beagle now {{sailed to}} {{southern}} Patagonia, and on 19 April an expedition including FitzRoy and Darwin {{set off to}} take boats {{as far as possible}} up the Santa Cruz river, with <b>all</b> <b>involved</b> taking turn in teams dragging the boats upstream. The river cut through a series of rises then plateaux forming wide plains covered with shells and shingle, and Darwin discussed with FitzRoy his interpretation that these terraces had been shores that had gradually raised in accordance with Lyell's theories. Several of the smaller rheas were seen in the distance, but were too elusive to catch. The expedition approached the Andes but had to turn back.|$|E
5|$|Vessels from Silla, Balhae and Hizen Province of Japan were <b>all</b> <b>involved</b> in the Yellow Sea trade, which Silla dominated. After Silla and Japan reopened renewed {{hostilities}} in {{the late}} 7th century, most Japanese maritime merchants chose to set sail from Nagasaki towards {{the mouth of the}} Huai River, the Yangzi River, and even as far south as the Hangzhou Bay in order to avoid Korean ships in the Yellow Sea. In order to sail back to Japan in 838, the Japanese embassy to China procured nine ships and sixty Korean sailors from the Korean wards of Chuzhou and Lianshui cities along the Huai River. It is also known that Chinese trade ships traveling to Japan set sail from the various ports along the coasts of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces.|$|E

5|$|While {{investigating}} {{the effect of}} the Acts, Josephine had been appalled that some of the prostitutes were as young as 12, and that there was a slave trade of young women and children from England to the continent for the purpose of prostitution. A campaign to combat the trafficking led to the removal from office of the head of the Belgian , and the trial and imprisonment of his deputy and 12 brothel owners, who were <b>all</b> <b>involved</b> in the trade. Josephine fought child prostitution with help from the campaigning editor of The Pall Mall Gazette, William Thomas Stead, who purchased a 13-year-old girl from her mother for £5. The subsequent outcry led to the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 which raised the age of consent from 13 to 16 years of age and brought in measures to stop children becoming prostitutes. Her final campaign was in the late-1890s, against the Contagious Diseases Acts which continued to be implemented in the British Raj.|$|E
5|$|While the {{executive}} branch of the Brazilian government plotted to retake or sink the rebelling warships, they were hampered by personnel distrust and equipment problems; historians have since cast doubt on their chances of successfully accomplishing either. At the same time, Congress—led by Rui Barbosa, a senator—pursued a route of amnesty, appointing a former navy captain as their liaison to the rebels. This latter route was successful, and a bill granting amnesty to <b>all</b> <b>involved</b> and ending the use of corporal punishment passed the lower house by a veto-proof margin. However, many of the sailors were quickly discharged from the navy, and after an unrelated second rebellion took place a few weeks later, many of the original mutineers were rounded up and thrown into jail or sent to work camps on the rubber plantations to the north.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of the}} raiding force {{depended}} on the objective. The smallest raid was conducted by two men from No. 6 Commando in Operation J V. The largest was the 10,500 man Operation Jubilee. Most of the raids were scheduled to only last overnight although some, like Operation Gauntlet, were conducted {{over a number of}} days. In north west Europe there were 57 raids made between 1940 and 1944. Of these 36 were against targets in France. There were 12 raids against Norway, seven raids in the Channel Islands, and single raids were made in Belgium and the Netherlands. The success of the raids varied; Operation Chariot, the raid against dock installations at St Nazaire, has been hailed as the greatest raid of all time, but others, like Operation Aquatint and Operation Musketoon, resulted in the capture or death of <b>all</b> <b>involved.</b> The smaller raids ended in mid-1944 on the orders of Major General Robert Laycock, who suggested that they were no longer as effective and only resulted in the Germans strengthening their beach defences, something that could be extremely detrimental to Allied plans.|$|E
