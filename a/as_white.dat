5000|$|For example, Brazilian writer, Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis, was a mulatto. However, once {{he gained}} fame and prestige, {{people started to}} accept him <b>as</b> a <b>white</b> man, and on his death {{certificate}} he was classified as a [...] "white man". Better educated and wealthier Brazilians usually see themselves <b>as</b> <b>whites</b> (a strict association between wealth and whiteness). A study showed that when mixed-race Brazilians get wealthier they start to be perceived <b>as</b> <b>whites</b> by others, who usually avoid associating a wealthy person with a non-white racial category. But only mixed-race people can [...] "become white" [...] when they get richer, while typically black people will always be perceived as blacks, no matter how rich they get.|$|R

50|$|In {{the first}} few years after the Civil War, white Confederate {{veterans}} developed the Ku Klux Klan, beginning in Tennessee; it had chapters throughout the South and attacked blacks and their supporters.

By the mid-1870s, new white paramilitary groups had arisen in the Deep South, including the Red Shirts in Mississippi, <b>as</b> <b>whites</b> struggled to regain political and social power over the black majority. Elections were marked by violence and fraud <b>as</b> <b>whites</b> worked to suppress black Republican voting.|$|R
