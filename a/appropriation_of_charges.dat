30|$|Significantly, however, an {{in-depth}} analysis {{suggests that this}} perspective fails to distinguish between CIHL and IHL treaties. As IHL treaties definitively prohibit <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> civilian property through illegal force, through the prohibition of pillage in GC IV Art 33, AP II (1977) Art 4  g), and also RS Art 8 2 (e) (v) and 8 2 (b) (xvi). In addition, the only allowance for legal <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> civilian property is found in RS Art 8 2 (a) (iv). This analysis has shown that allowances in CIHL for <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> civilian property due to imperative military necessity are extremely specific and do not, in any circumstances, justify pillage. We can maintain therefore that under IHL, pillage, or the <b>appropriation</b> <b>of</b> civilian property by illegal force is categorically prohibited.|$|R
