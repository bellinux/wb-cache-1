5|$|A {{pregnant}} woman's elevated {{blood lead}} level can lead to miscarriage, prematurity, low birth weight, and problems with development during childhood. Lead is able {{to pass through the}} placenta and into breast milk, and {{blood lead level}}s in mothers and infants are usually similar. <b>A</b> <b>fetus</b> may be poisoned in utero if lead from the mother's bones is subsequently mobilized by the changes in metabolism due to pregnancy; increased calcium intake in pregnancy may help mitigate this phenomenon.|$|E

5|$|Cases {{have been}} {{recorded}} by medical authorities since the 16th century, though some archaeological cases provide evidence for its occurrence in many periods of human history. While cases of postmortem fetal expulsion have always been rare, the phenomenon has been recorded under disparate circumstances and is occasionally seen in a modern forensic context when {{the body of a}} pregnant woman lies undisturbed and undiscovered for some time following death. There are also cases whereby <b>a</b> <b>fetus</b> may become separated from the body of the pregnant woman about the time of death or during decomposition, though because those cases are not consistent with the processes described here, they are not considered true cases of postmortem fetal extrusion.|$|E

5|$|Rh factor, {{also known}} as Rh D antigen, is an antigen found on red blood cells; {{individuals}} that are Rh-positive (Rh+) have this antigen on their red blood cells and individuals that are Rh-negative (Rh–) do not. During normal childbirth, delivery trauma or complications during pregnancy, blood from <b>a</b> <b>fetus</b> can enter the mother's system. In {{the case of an}} Rh-incompatible mother and child, consequential blood mixing may sensitize an Rh- mother to the Rh antigen on the blood cells of the Rh+ child, putting the remainder of the pregnancy, and any subsequent pregnancies, at risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} in {{a newborn baby}} are much larger as a {{proportion}} of the body size than in an adult. For example, at age three months the glands are four {{times the size of the}} kidneys. The size of the glands decreases relatively after birth, mainly because of shrinkage of the cortex. The cortex, which almost completely disappears by age 1, develops again from age 4–5. The glands weigh about 1 g at birth and develop to an adult weight of about 4 grams each. In <b>a</b> <b>fetus</b> the glands are first detectable after the sixth week of development.|$|E
40|$|We {{measured}} deoxycorticosterone (DOC) and progesterone (P) in plasma of 47 women {{pregnant with}} <b>a</b> dead <b>fetus</b> and sequentially throughout gestation in 35 women pregnant with <b>a</b> live <b>fetus.</b> When P levels in plasma were low, the plasma levels of DOC in women pregnant with <b>a</b> dead <b>fetus</b> varied but usually {{were similar to}} those in women pregnant with <b>a</b> live <b>fetus.</b> However, when P levels were high, the levels of DOC in some women pregnant with <b>a</b> dead <b>fetus</b> were considerably lower than those in women pregnant with <b>a</b> live <b>fetus.</b> To test whether this finding was due to loss of transfer of DOC from fetus to mother or else loss of extraadrenal steroid 21 -hydroxylase activity in the mother after death of the fetus, we conducted several studies. The levels of P and DOC in plasma of one woman remained constant from 30 min after fetal death until delivery occurred 13 h later. Estrogen treatment of four women pregnant with <b>a</b> dead <b>fetus</b> brought about <b>an</b> increase in plasma levels of DOC in three of the women. In one woman the ratio of plasma DOC to P was 0. 015, a value similar to that found before fetal death, but was 0. 003 after fetal death but before estrogen treatment. In two women pregnant with <b>a</b> dead <b>fetus</b> the transfer constants of conversion of plasma P to DOC were 0. 011 and 0. 005 before, and 0. 024 and 0. 013, respectively, during estrogen treatment. In one woman pregnant with <b>a</b> deformed <b>fetus</b> with adrenal agenesis, the metabolic clearance rates of DOC before and during estrogen treatment were similar, whereas the plasma production rates of DOC were 2. 75 before and 4. 31 mg/ 24 h during estrogen treatment. We suggest that (a) the DOC in plasma of near-term pregnant women arises in part by extraadrenal 21 -hydroxylation of plasma P and (b) estrogen stimulates steroid 21 -hydroxylase activity in extraadrenal tissues...|$|R

5|$|Vitamins are {{essential}} for the normal growth and development of a multicellular organism. Using the genetic blueprint inherited from its parents, <b>a</b> <b>fetus</b> begins to develop from the nutrients it absorbs. It requires certain vitamins and minerals to be present at certain times. These nutrients facilitate the chemical reactions that produce among other things, skin, bone, and muscle. If there is serious deficiency {{in one or more}} of these nutrients, a child may develop a deficiency disease. Even minor deficiencies may cause permanent damage.|$|E
5|$|In {{her work}} How Kantian Ethics Should Treat Pregnancy and Abortion, Susan Feldman argues that {{abortion}} should be defended according to Kantian ethics. She proposed {{that a woman}} {{should be treated as}} a dignified autonomous person, with control over their body, as Kant suggested. She believes that the free choice of women would be paramount in Kantian ethics, requiring abortion to be the mother's decision. Dean Harris has noted that, if Kantian ethics is {{to be used in the}} discussion of abortion, it must be decided whether <b>a</b> <b>fetus</b> is an autonomous person. Kantian ethicist Carl Cohen argues that the potential to be rational or participation in a generally rational species is the relevant distinction between humans and inanimate objects or irrational animals. Cohen believes that even when humans are not rational because of age (such as babies or fetuses) or mental disability, agents are still morally obligated to treat them as an ends in themselves, equivalent to a rational adult such as a mother seeking an abortion.|$|E

Sephiroth's role in the story, as well as his background, are expanded in the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII. Additionally, he appears as a boss character in the Kingdom Hearts series, and other video games developed by Square.

5|$|Specimens {{belonging}} to the genus were first discovered in a locality near Xinmin in Guizhou, China in 2002. At the same locality, which dates to 244 million years ago, other marine reptiles such as Mixosaurus, Keichousaurus, and Wumengosaurus have also been found. While the type specimen consisted only of a skull and the very front of the neck, additional specimens soon revealed the complete form of the body. Further discoveries of Dinocephalosaurus specimens were made in Luoping, Yunnan, China, starting in 2008. At this locality, Dinocephalosaurus would have lived alongside Mixosaurus, Dianopachysaurus, and Sinosaurosphargis. One specimen discovered at the Luoping locality preserves <b>a</b> <b>fetus</b> within its abdomen, indicating that Dinocephalosaurus gave birth to live young like many other marine reptiles. Dinocephalosaurus {{is one of the}} few known members of the Archosauromorpha which are known to give live birth, asides from the metriorhynchids, a group of marine crocodylomorphs.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Indian Ayurveda {{tradition}} independently {{developed the}} concept of three humours, resembling that of the four humours of ancient Greek medicine, though the Ayurvedic system included further complications, such as the body being composed of five elements and seven basic tissues. Ayurvedic writers also classified living things into four categories based on the method of birth (from the womb, eggs, heat & moisture, and seeds) and explained the conception of <b>a</b> <b>fetus</b> in detail. They also made considerable advances {{in the field of}} surgery, often without the use of human dissection or animal vivisection. One of the earliest Ayurvedic treatises was the Sushruta Samhita, attributed to Sushruta in the 6th century BCE. It was also an early materia medica, describing 700 medicinal plants, 64 preparations from mineral sources, and 57 preparations based on animal sources.|$|E

40|$|Pregnancy {{outcome is}} influenced, in part, by {{the sex of}} the fetus. Decidual renin {{messenger}} RNA (REN) abundance is greater in women carrying <b>a</b> female <b>fetus</b> than <b>a</b> male <b>fetus.</b> Here, we explore whether {{the sex of the}} fetus also influences the regulation of decidual RAS expression with a known stimulator of renal renin and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Cyclic adenosine monophosphate had no affect on decidual REN expression, since REN abundance was still greater in decidual explants from women carrying <b>a</b> female <b>fetus</b> than <b>a</b> male <b>fetus</b> after cAMP treatment. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate decreased prorenin levels in the supernatant if the fetus was female (ie, prorenin levels were no longer sexually dimorphic) and altered the fetal sex-specific differences in other RAS genes seen in vitro. Therefore, fetal sex influences the decidual renin-angiotensin system response to cAMP. This {{may be related to the}} presence of fetal cells in the maternal decidua...|$|R
