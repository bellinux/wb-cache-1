40|$|This project {{developed}} a web-based application {{that addresses the}} problem of identifying {{the value of the}} TMC in managing disruptions to the transportation system by quantifying the delay savings that can be attributed directly to TMC actions. Using event data from TMC <b>activity</b> <b>logs</b> and traffic state data from the PeMS database, the system identifies the time-space impact of events in the activity database using a mathematical-programming formulation to match evidence of disruption to computed time-space bounds. Given this boundary, the actual delay associated with the impacted region is calculated. To compute the savings attributable to the TMC, the <b>activity</b> <b>logs</b> are used to identify when the direct disruption by the event is removed (e. g., when an accident is cleared) and models the increased delay that would occur if this clearance was delayed. Given these calculations, the system allows TMC managers to evaluate the performance of various bundles of TMC technologies and operational policies by mapping their effects onto events in the system that can be measured using existing surveillance <b>systems</b> and daily <b>activity</b> <b>logs.</b> The <b>system</b> is deployed atop the CTMLabs service-oriented architecture and is available as a application on the CTMLabs website for use by authenticated users...|$|R

However, the available data often lacks important elements such as the identification of user sessions. Previous work typically compensated for this by setting a threshold of around 30 minutes, and assuming that breaks in activity longer than the threshold reflect breaks between sessions. We show that using such a global threshold introduces artifacts that may affect the analysis, because there is a high probability that long sessions are not identified correctly. As an alternative, we suggest that a suitable individual threshold be found for each user, based on that user’s activity pattern. Applying this approach to a large dataset from the AOL search engine leads to a distribution of session durations that is free of artifacts like those that appear when using a global threshold...|$|R
40|$|<b>Activity</b> <b>logs</b> can be {{used for}} {{intrusion}} detection; however, most previous work on intrusion detection examines only <b>activity</b> <b>logs</b> from a single component. Doing so fails {{to take advantage of the}} naturally existing correlations among activities in di#erent types of logs, such as network <b>logs</b> and <b>system</b> call <b>logs.</b> This paper explores correlation for intrusion detection. Specifically, we unified logging architecture that can effectively capture correlations among entries in different types of logs. UCLog enables the intrusion detection system to make some sense of the myriad of different available logs and correlate the information the logs present to enhance the intrusion detection process. We have evaluated UCLog by using it to detect the infection of a host with the Yaha virus. Our results show significant improvement when the information available in several logs is correlated...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of an organization's {{computer}} network activity {{is a key}} component of early detection and mitigation of insider threat, a growing concern for many organizations. Raw <b>system</b> <b>logs</b> are a prototypical example of streaming data that can quickly scale beyond the cognitive power of a human analyst. As a prospective filter for the human analyst, we present an online unsupervised deep learning approach to detect anomalous network <b>activity</b> from <b>system</b> <b>logs</b> in real time. Our models decompose anomaly scores into the contributions of individual user behavior features for increased interpretability to aid analysts reviewing potential cases of insider threat. Using the CERT Insider Threat Dataset v 6. 2 and threat detection recall as our performance metric, our novel deep and recurrent neural network models outperform Principal Component Analysis, Support Vector Machine and Isolation Forest based anomaly detection baselines. For our best model, the events labeled as insider threat activity in our dataset had an average anomaly score in the 95. 53 percentile, demonstrating our approach's potential to greatly reduce analyst workloads.

40|$|AbstractPurposeThe {{purpose of}} this study is twofold: (1) to derive a {{workflow}} consensus from multiple clinical <b>activity</b> <b>logs</b> and (2) to detect workflow outliers automatically and without prior knowledge from experts. MethodsWorkflow mining is used in this paper to derive consensus workflow from multiple surgical <b>activity</b> <b>logs</b> using tree-guided multiple sequence alignment. To detect outliers, a global pair-wise sequence alignment (Needleman–Wunsch) algorithm is used. The proposed method is validated for Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (LAPCHOL). ResultsAn <b>activity</b> <b>log</b> is directly derived for each LAPCHOL surgery from laparoscopic video using an already developed instrument tracking tool. We showed that a generic consensus can be derived from surgical <b>activity</b> <b>logs</b> using multi-alignment. In total 26 surgery logs are used to derive the consensus for laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The derived consensus conforms to the main steps of laparoscopic cholecystectomy as described in best practices. Using global pair-wise alignment, we showed that outliers can be detected from surgeries using the consensus and the surgical <b>activity</b> <b>log.</b> ConclusionAlignment techniques can be used to derive consensus and to detect outliers from clinical <b>activity</b> <b>logs.</b> Detecting outliers particularly in surgery is a main step to automatically mine and analyse the underlying cause of these outliers and improve surgical practices...|$|R

While logging {{events is}} {{becoming}} increasingly common in computing, in communication and in collaborative environments, <b>log</b> <b>systems</b> need to satisfy increasingly challenging (if not conflicting) requirements. In this {{paper we propose a}} high-level framework for modeling <b>log</b> <b>systems,</b> and reasoning about them. This framework allows one to give a high-level representation of a <b>log</b> <b>system</b> and to check whether it satisfies given audit and privacy properties which in turn can be expressed in standard logic. In particular, the framework can be used for comparing and assessing <b>log</b> <b>systems.</b> We validate our proposal by formalizing a number of standard log properties and by using it to review a number of existing systems. Despite the growing pervasiveness of <b>log</b> <b>systems,</b> we believe this is the first framework of this sort. ...|$|R

40|$|Online Social Networks (OSNs) allow {{users to}} create and share content (e. g., posts, status updates, comments) in real-time. These {{activities}} are collected in an <b>activity</b> <b>log,</b> (e. g. Facebook Wall, Google+ Stream, etc.) on the user’s social network profile. With time, the <b>activity</b> <b>logs</b> of users, which record the sequences of social activities, become too long and consequently hard to view and navigate. To alleviate this cluttering, {{it is useful to}} select a small subset of the social activities within the specified timeperiod as representative, i. e., as summary, for this time-period. In this paper, we study the novel problem of social <b>activity</b> <b>log</b> summarization. We propose LogRank, a novel and principled algorithm to select activities that satisfy three desirable criteria: First, activities must be important for the user. Second, they must be diverse in terms of topic, e. g., cover several of the major topics in the <b>activity</b> <b>log.</b> Third, they should be time-dispersed, that is, be spread across the specified time range of the <b>activity</b> <b>log.</b> LogRank operates on an appropriately augmented social interaction graph and employs random-walk techniques to holistically balance all three criteria. We evaluate LogRank and its variants on a real dataset from the Google+ social network and show that they outperform baseline approaches. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{framework}} for autonomous data-driven discrete-event simulation (DES) modeling process that transforms operation data to Activity Cycle Diagram (ACD) -based DES models without a priori model network. The proposed framework uses the idea of process mining to discover a real process by extracting knowledge from <b>activity</b> <b>logs,</b> which are the lists of sequences of activities per cycle in terms of resources. The discovered process is then modeled as an ACD which can replicate the underlying <b>activity</b> <b>logs.</b> <b>Activity</b> <b>log</b> {{plays a key role}} in this procedure as it determines the set of activities that we can identify and thus govern the analysis scope of the generated simulation model. It is therefore important to design and collect <b>activity</b> <b>log</b> data in a way to capture all the activities for an intended abstraction level. In order to automate the model generation procedure considering this requirement, we employ the notion of activity ontology, which specifies various activities and their relations for a given construction operation at different abstraction levels in a predefined manner. Using the ontology-based framework, we can systemize the procedure of simulation modeling, which entails selecting the abstraction level of simulation model, identifying the list of activities that need to be inferred from data to create <b>activity</b> <b>logs,</b> and determining the type and resolution of data to be collected. The proposed framework is explained and demonstrated using an earthmoving operation example...|$|R
