Of particular note, Fitzgerald indicates that while Wain's art took on a more abstract nature as he grew older, his technique and skill as a painter did not diminish, <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> from a person with schizophrenia. Moreover, elements of visual agnosia are demonstrated in his painting. If Wain had visual agnosia, it might have manifested itself merely as an extreme attention to detail.|$|E

25|$|According to the Free-radical theory, {{oxidative}} damage initiated by {{reactive oxygen species}} is {{a major contributor to}} the functional decline that is characteristic of aging. While studies in invertebrate models indicate that animals genetically engineered to lack specific antioxidant enzymes (such as SOD), in general, show a shortened lifespan (<b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> from the theory), the converse manipulation, increasing the levels of antioxidant enzymes, has yielded inconsistent effects on lifespan (though some studies in Drosophila do show that lifespan can be increased by the overexpression of MnSOD or glutathione biosynthesizing enzymes). Also contrary to this theory, deletion of mitochondrial SOD2 can extend lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect,</b> Metzinger’s {{concept of}} {{painting}} was both {{more sophisticated and}} perceptive than Cézanne, but fundamentally {{the shape of the}} misunderstandings that were to follow Cubism were the same as Cézanne's, and so too were the implications. Metzinger had seen painting as rooted in the experience of nature: four-dimensional and geometric. He stressed this heavily, {{and at the same time}} brought out the flatness and dislocations of Cézanne’s transformations of nature—with the conceptual aspect of multiple perspectives and non-Euclidean spacetime. The importance of Cubism, he accepted, was to emphasize the idea that everything visible (objects) and invisible (consciousness) has an n-dimensional geometric basis (an idea he associated with ‘construct an infinite number of different spaces for the use of painters’).|$|E

The products were introduced {{in a series of}} three pairs of commercials in both 15 and 30 second formats. The commercials featured animals such as snails or frogs that are used as exotic cuisine in various regions of the world. As the narrator announces BK is looking for new and more complex ingredients for their new line of sandwiches, the animals are shown reacting in a fearful way believing they are the new ingredients. At the end, the narrator declares one of the new flavors and the animal is relieved to find out they are not food, then they are promptly dispatched by the new food item (e.g. the frog is hit with a mango).|$|E
25|$|Many {{compounds}} {{of thorium}} are known: {{this is because}} thorium and uranium are the most stable and accessible actinides and are the only actinides that can be studied safely and legally in bulk in a normal laboratory. As such, they have the best-known chemistry of the actinides, along with that of plutonium, as the self-heating and radiation from them {{is not enough to}} cause radiolysis of chemical bonds as it is for the other actinides. While the later actinides from americium onwards are predominantly trivalent and behave more similarly to the corresponding lanthanides, <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> from periodic trends, the early actinides up to plutonium (thus including thorium and uranium) have relativistically destabilised and hence delocalised 5f and 6d electrons that participate in chemistry in a similar way to the early transition metals of group 3 through 8: thus, all their valence electrons can participate in chemical reactions, although this is not common for neptunium and plutonium.|$|E
25|$|Afrikaans uses a diaeresis to mark vowels {{that are}} {{pronounced}} separately and not <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> where they occur together, for example voel (to feel) {{as opposed to}} voël (bird). The circumflex is used in ê, î, ô and û generally to indicate long close-mid, as opposed to open-mid vowels, for example in the words wêreld (world) and môre (morning, tomorrow). The acute accent is used to add emphasis {{in the same way}} as underlining or writing in bold or italics in English, for example Dit is jóú boek (It is your book). The grave accent is used to distinguish between words that are different only in placement of the stress, for example appel (apple) and appèl (appeal) and in a few cases where it makes no difference to the pronunciation but distinguishes between homophones. The two most usual cases of the latter are the in the sayings òf... òf (either... or) and nòg... nòg (neither... nor) to distinguish them from of (or) and nog (again, still).|$|E

25|$|In this outdoor hunting {{scene the}} horizon line is almost {{on top of}} the canvas. Seven people are present, along with {{numerous}} animals. A man with a hunting horn (Cor de chasse, la trompe du piqueur) {{can be seen in the}} foreground, his back turned to the viewer, with a group of hunting dogs to his right. Men on horses prepare for departure. Tension is in the air as the hunters and animals interact with one another. Another hunter on foot holds a gun in the background with a woman and child nearby and a village beyond. Spatial depth is minimized, the overall composition flattened, yet distances to the viewer are determined by the relationship of size; the further the object, the smaller in appearance. The faceting however does not partake in the size-distance relation, <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect.</b> The hunting dogs to the lower right, for example, are treated with similar sized 'cubes' as the elements in the upper portions of the canvas; corresponding to the background. The hunting horn in the foreground is almost identical in size and in faceting to the trees in the distance. The same rounded shapes espouse the spherical surfaces formed by the horses heads. This serves to counter the illusion of depth; each portion of the canvas equally important in the overall composition.|$|E
500|$|According to scholar Sondra O'Neale, Angelou's poetry can {{be placed}} within the African-American oral tradition, and her prose [...] "follows classic {{technique}} in nonpoetic Western forms". [...] O'Neale states that Angelou avoided using a [...] "monolithic black language", and accomplished, through direct dialogue, what O'Neale calls a [...] "more expected ghetto expressiveness". [...] McWhorter finds both the language Angelou used in her autobiographies and the people she depicted unrealistic, resulting in a separation {{between her and her}} audience. [...] As McWhorter states, [...] "I have never read autobiographical writing where I had such a hard time summoning a sense of how the subject talks, or a sense of who the subject really is". [...] McWhorter asserts, for example, that key figures in Angelou's books, like herself, her son Guy, and mother Vivian do not speak <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect,</b> and that their speech is [...] "cleaned up" [...] for her readers. [...] Guy, for example, represents the young black male, while Vivian represents the idealized mother figure, and the stiff language they use, as well as the language in Angelou's text, is intended to prove that blacks can use standard English competently.|$|E

In 1975 Hordern played {{the judge in}} Howard Barker's play Stripwell at the Royal Court Theatre. Hordern described the character as [...] "a man wracked by guilt, full of self-doubt and pessimism". It was a role which the actor found to be too close to his own personality for comfort.

Hordern and Eve soon reconciled, {{but it was a}} time which he was keen to forget, including the play. Critics were complimentary of his performance, with one writing: [...] "Stripwells ambiguities are therefore viewed half affectionately and half contemptuously and this comes over well in Michael Hordern's portrayal of bumbling, sometimes endearing ineffectiveness, as skilful and accomplished a performance <b>as</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> from this actor." ...|$|E
