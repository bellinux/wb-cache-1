5|$|Journalist Ralph McGill, once a {{teammate}} of Cody's, said: He {{was a great}} big fellow {{and one of the}} most seriously dedicated fellows I've ever met. He was a farm boy and he didn't have any polish but he was very honest and sincere. He didn't have scholarshipwe had none in those days but he had a real job. He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. He was a big man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast for a big man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and sewed it to the shoulders of the jersey <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> the padding he wore.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home on August 30 {{to play the}} Arizona Diamondbacks. Ian Kennedy and three relievers held the Dodgers scoreless and Kershaw allowed one 2-run homer by Chris Young <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> they needed as the Diamondbacks beat the Dodgers 2–0. The team dropped to 4 games behind the Giants, their largest deficit of the season. Reliever Matt Guerrier allowed a solo homer to Jason Kubel in the 11th inning on August 31, to give the Dodgers a 4–3 loss, their eighth straight loss to the Diamondbacks on the season.|$|E
25|$|Henry J. Kaiser's {{company had}} been {{building}} cargo ships for the U.S. Maritime Commission in the late 1930s. In 1940 orders for ships from the British government, already at war with Nazi Germany, allowed for growth. Kaiser established his first Richmond shipyard beginning in December 1940, eventually building three more in Richmond; each yard with four to eight slips to build ships. Kaiser-Permanente specialized in mass-producing Liberty ships quickly and efficiently, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> they built until 1944, when they switched to the much more complicated Victory ships and built some tugs and Landing Ship, Tank (LSTs) and other specialized ships in the newly built Yard #4.|$|E
25|$|Treaties {{obtained}} from local chiefs in Africa were not aimed at having them accept their subjugation − superior force did that (just {{as it had}} for the chiefs themselves, earlier) − but were solely to impress on rival colonial powers {{that they had the}} means to convince their own populations of the justice of any military action they might have to take to defend their claim to civilize the area, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> that mattered. The idea of democracy was spreading in Europe all throughout the nineteenth century, and, increasingly, governments were required to take account of public opinion. Public opinion in Europe could be a powerful motivator of colonial actions, as the Fashoda Incident a few years later demonstrated.|$|E

25|$|They next {{traveled}} to AT Park {{for a series}} against the first place San Francisco Giants. In the opener, Kershaw had another strong game, allowing two runs and five hits in eight innings with 13 strikeouts. A solo homer by Justin Turner {{in the top of}} the ninth gave the Dodgers a 3–2 win. Buster Posey hit a walk-off RBI single off of Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen the next day as the Giants won 5–4 in 10 innings. Urías struck out seven in the next game, and only allowed two runs, but those were on a two-run homer by Brandon Belt in the 6th <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> the Giants needed for a 2–1 victory. The Dodgers {{traveled to}} Chase Field for a road series against the Arizona Diamondbacks beginning on June 13. Former Dodger Zack Greinke struck out six over seven innings to beat his old team, 3–2. The Dodgers had two homers from Joc Pederson and solo shots by Justin Turner and Chase Utley as they evened the series with a 7–4 win the next game. A three-run homer by Scott Van Slyke accounted for all the Dodgers runs as the finished off the series with a 3–2 win. Kershaw struck out 11 in 7 innings to pick up his 10th win of the season.|$|E

500|$|In July 1995, Williams {{announced}} that he was leaving Take That, a boy band in which both he and Barlow took part.

After 13 years, in 2008, during the band's work on their fifth studio album, The Circus, Barlow and Williams {{met for the first time}} since the latter left the band. In 2010, in an interview on BBC Radio 1, Williams elaborated, [...] "'It is one of those situations in life that could be very explosive and could go completely wrong.

She also hoped {{that she is not}} as irritating as Natasha in real life and added [...] "I'm not a manipulative teenage girl who's forever wanting everything her own way." [...] In March 2011, Novakovic revealed that she would like to see Natasha become a nicer person, grow up and turn over a new leaf. She said [...] "There are glimpses of the nice girl in Tash."

500|$|In {{film editor}} Susan Korda's 2005 lecture, [...] "We'll Fix It in the Edit!?", at the Berlinale Talent Campus, she broadly {{explained}} {{the contribution of}} editing to the film: [...] "What is fascinating in Jaws is that the shark has a personality, the shark has an intelligence, indeed sometimes I think the shark {{has a sense of}} humor, morbid as it might be. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> achieved in the first two acts of the film before you see the shark. So the cutting was very essential for that." [...] David Bordwell has used the second shark attack scene in Jaws as (literally) a textbook illustration of an editing innovation that occurred in the late 1960s. The innovation, which Fields herself named the [...] "wipe by cut", can be used when a character is filmed from a distance using a telephoto lens. The cut to a different framing of the character occurs during the interruption by a figure who passes between the camera and the character. The cut thus masks itself, and avoids drawing the viewer's attention away from the narrative of the scene.|$|E

Revolution, I repeat, doesn't need violence. The general strike, as practised in Seattle, is of itself the weapon of revolution, all the more dangerous because quiet. To succeed, it must suspend everything; stop the entire life stream of a community... <b>That</b> <b>is</b> to say, it puts the government out of operation. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>all</b> there <b>is</b> to revolt–no matter how achieved.|$|R

We performed this assessment using four typical ENM <b>that</b> <b>are</b> covering different classes <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>all</b> produced <b>and</b> used in high quantities: nano-TiO 2, nano-ZnO, carbon nanotube (CNT), and nano-Ag [11].

Juan Rivera welcomed himself to his new teammates by hitting a home run on the first pitch he saw as a Dodger. The streak ended the next day as Hiroki Kuroda's bad luck continued. He allowed a three-run homer to Brandon Allen, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>all</b> the Diamondbacks needed as they held on for a 3-2 win, despite Matt Kemp's 24th homer of the season. Ted Lilly struck out nine batters in 6 2/3 innings on July 17, but he also gave up two home runs, including one to Diamondbacks pitcher Daniel Hudson. Hudson, meanwhile pitched a complete game, and the only run the Dodgers scored in the 4-1 defeat was on a wild pitch. In the game, Lilly became the first Dodger pitcher since Jeff Weaver in 2005 to allow both 20 homers and 20 steals in a season. The Dodgers next traveled to San Francisco to play the first place Giants. Ryan Vogelsong shut down the Dodgers anemic offense, 5-0, to drop them a season worst 13 1/2 games behind the Giants. It was the Dodgers 10th shutout loss of the season. Hong-Chih Kuo allowed a two-run double to Brandon Belt in the seventh inning to lead the Giants to a 5-3 victory over the Dodgers on July 19. With the offense continuing to sputter, ranking next to last in runs scored in the league, the team fired hitting coach Jeff Pentland on July 20. [...] Assistant hitting coach Dave Hansen was promoted to interim hitting coach for the rest of the season. Clayton Kershaw again snapped the Dodgers losing streak, pitching eight shutout innings while striking out 12 to out duel Giants ace Tim Lincecum on July 20.
