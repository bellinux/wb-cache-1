It’s a common complaint, {{but a lot}} of recent Simpsons episodes waste promising storylines this way. You’ve got Homer and his pig buddy, coming back together before a barbeque sauce-and-hounds mishaps leads to Mr. Burns taking a shine to the injured Plopper. But that’s only set up by Marge’s enthusiasm for a Japanese anti-cluttering book/philosophy that sees her urging the family to toss out anything that 'no longer brings them joy' (that’s an episode), which leads to Lisa discovering that, once she’s given away everything but her sax (and her Bleeding Gums Murphy poster), she’s lost all joy in playing. 'I finally feel <b>about</b> my sax <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> all do!,' she wails in horror. And that’s another episode. Throw in some promising emotional beats to that story—Homer comforts the confused Lisa during an anxiety attack, Bart hijacks the school’s PA system to restore her love for jazz—and there’s an abundance of good ideas not given enough time to come to fruition." ...|$|R

40|$|This leaflet is {{for anyone}} who wants to know more about Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). It {{discusses}} how it works, why it is used, its effects, its side-effects, and alternative treatments. If you can&# 39;t find what you want here, there are sources of further information {{at the end of this}} leaflet. What is CBT? It is a way of talking about: ï,§ how you think <b>about</b> yourself, <b>the</b> world and other people ï,§ how what you do affects your thoughts and feelings. CBT can help you to change how you think (&# 39;Cognitive&# 39;) and what you do (&# 39;Behaviour&# 39;). These changes can help you to feel better. Unlike some of the other talking treatments, it focuses on the &# 39;here and now&# 39; problems and difficulties. Instead of focusing on the causes of your distress or symptoms in the past, it looks for ways to improve your state of mind now. When does CBT help? CBT has been shown to help with many different types of problems. These include: anxiety, depression, panic, phobias (including agoraphobia and social phobia), stress, bulimia, obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder and psychosis. CBT may also help if you have difficulties with anger, a low opinion of yourself or physical health problems, like pain or fatigue. How does it work? CBT can help you to make sense of overwhelming problems by breaking them down into smaller parts. This makes it easier to see how they are connected and how they affect you. These parts are: ï,§ A Situation - a problem, event or difficult situation. From this can follow: ï,§ Thoughts ï,§ Emotions ï,§ Physical feelings ï,§ Actions Each of these areas can affect the others. How you think about a problem can affect how you feel physically and emotionally. All these areas of life can connect like this: { 5 Areas - click related link below} What happens in one of these areas can affect all the others. There are helpful and unhelpful ways of reacting to most situations, depending on how <b>you</b> think <b>about</b> it. <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> think can be helpful - or unhelpful. An example: If you go home feeling depressed, you&# 39;ll probably brood on what has happened and feel worse. If you get in touch with the other person, there&# 39;s a good chance you&# 39;ll feel better about yourself. If you avoid the other person, you won&# 39;t be able to correct any misunderstandings about what they think of you - and you will probably feel worse. This &# 39;vicious circle&# 39; can make you feel worse. It can even create new situations that make you feel worse. You can start to believe quite unrealistic (and unpleasant) things about yourself. This happens because, when we are distressed, we are more likely to jump to conclusions and to interpret things in extreme and unhelpful ways. CBT can help you to break this vicious circle of altered thinking, feelings and behaviour. When you see the parts of the sequence clearly, you can change them - and so change <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> feel. CBT aims to get you to a point where you can &# 39;do it yourself&# 39;, and work out your own ways of tackling these problems.
