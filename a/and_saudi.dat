5|$|By 1971, both Egypt <b>and</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia had {{disengaged}} from Yemen. South Yemen {{formed a}} connection with the Soviet Union. In September 1971, Amri resigned after murdering a photographer in San'a, and more power was given to Iryani, the effective President. By then, the royalists were integrated into the new republic, except for al-Badr's family, and a consultative Council was established.

5|$|He went to Saudi Arabia from 4 to 6 November {{in hopes}} of obtaining {{financial}} aid and securing trade agreements. However, leaked cables revealed increasingly strained relations between Zardari <b>and</b> <b>Saudi</b> royalty, primarily because of Saudi distrust of Zardari and preference for Sharif. Weaker cooperation led to decreased oil subsidies {{as part of a}} broader Saudi policy of withholding monetary assistance.|$|E

After officially resigning as President, Quwatli was exiled to Alexandria, Egypt. In Egypt he was respected as a guest of honor by King Farouk and after the July 1952 revolution, by the Free Officers who gained power. Despite his positive relationship with the ousted King Farouk, Quwatli developed a close friendship with {{the founder of the}} Free Officers, Gamal Abdel Nasser, who became Egypt's leader in 1954.|$|E
5|$|As it {{had become}} evident that the Aouzou Strip was being used by Libya {{as a base for}} deeper {{involvement}} in Chad, Malloum decided to bring the issue of the Strip's occupation before the UN and the Organisation of African Unity. Malloum also decided he needed new allies; he negotiated a formal alliance with Habré, the Khartoum Accord, in September. This accord was kept secret until 22 January, when a Fundamental Charter was signed, following which a National Union Government was formed on 29 August 1978 with Habré as Prime Minister. The Malloum-Habré accord was actively promoted by Sudan <b>and</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia, both of which feared a radical Chad controlled by Gaddafi. The two nations saw in Habré, with his good Muslim and anti-colonialialist credentials, the only chance to thwart Gaddafi's plans.|$|E

5|$|Capital {{punishment}} is sanctioned in the United States for certain federal and military crimes, {{and used in}} 31 states. No executions took place from 1967 to 1977, owing {{in part to a}} U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. In 1976, that Court ruled that, under appropriate circumstances, capital punishment may constitutionally be imposed. Since the decision there have been more than 1,300 executions, a majority of these taking place in three states: Texas, Virginia, and Oklahoma. Meanwhile, several states have either abolished or struck down death penalty laws. In 2015, the country had the fifth-highest number of executions in the world, following China, Iran, Pakistan <b>and</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia.|$|E
5|$|During several {{independent}} {{field studies}} cracks and other ground deformations were observed {{on both the}} Egyptian <b>and</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabian sides of the gulf.

A field investigation was also done in Egypt in 1996 by seismologist Yann Klinger and others along with the Egyptian Geological Survey and Mining Authority. The most dramatic ground ruptures found were north of Nuweiba along a coastal road.|$|E

Sadat discussed {{the possibility of using}} oil as an economic weapon to pressure Western governments into adopting more pro-Arab policies. During the war, oil-producing Arab nations, primarily Libya <b>and</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia, initiated an oil embargo, and several sent token forces to the front lines.|$|E

5|$|In Africa, Somali army {{officers}} led by Siad Barre {{carried out a}} bloodless coup in 1969, creating the socialist Somali Democratic Republic. The Soviet Union vowed to support Somalia. Four years later, the pro-American Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie was overthrown in a 1974 coup by the Derg, a radical group of Ethiopian {{army officers}} led by the pro-Soviet Mengistu Haile Mariam, who built up relations with the Cubans and the Soviets. When fighting between the Somalis and Ethiopians {{broke out in the}} 1977–1978 Somali-Ethiopian Ogaden War, Barre lost his Soviet support and turned to the Safari Club—a group of pro-American intelligence agencies including Iran, Egypt, <b>and</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia—for support and weapons.

5|$|In January 1957, the US {{adopted the}} Eisenhower Doctrine and pledged {{to prevent the}} spread of {{communism}} and its perceived agents in the Middle East. Although Nasser was an opponent of communism in the region, his promotion of pan-Arabism was viewed as a threat by pro-Western states in the region. Eisenhower tried to isolate Nasser and reduce his regional influence by attempting to transform King Saud into a counterweight. Also in January, the elected Jordanian prime minister and Nasser supporter Sulayman al-Nabulsi brought Jordan into a military pact with Egypt, Syria, <b>and</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia.|$|E
5|$|In October 1936, rebel {{operations}} temporarily ceased {{after the}} Arab Higher Committee (AHC), the revolt's political leadership, accepted calls by the generally pro-British royals of Jordan, Iraq <b>and</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia for a cessation of hostilities. In return, the Arab royals would lobby the British Mandatory authorities to address Palestinian Arab concerns about Zionist activity in Palestine. That month, al-Qawuqji left Palestine. Al-Hajj Muhammad followed suit {{and headed for}} Damascus to evade arrest; the British had placed a bounty of 500 pounds on him. While in Damascus, al-Hajj Muhammad raised funds and purchased weapons for the revolt. He also began working with Syrian and Lebanese nationalists to smuggle the arms into Palestine. Al-Hajj Muhammad later left Damascus for the Lebanese mountain village of Qarnayel east of Beirut. From there, he maintained regular communications with his forces.|$|E

Required to secure a two-thirds majority in the 142-member Syrian Parliament in order to win, Quwatli defeated his main opponent Khalid al-Azm 89 to 42 (a further six votes were cast as invalid) in the first round. This prompted a second round of voting, in which Quwatli won the presidency with 91 votes against Azm's 41 (a further five votes were blank and two invalid.) Quwatli's bid for the presidency was supported by the governments of Egypt <b>and</b> <b>Saudi</b> Arabia, both of which were allied in their opposition to the Baghdad Pact as was Quwatli.|$|E
