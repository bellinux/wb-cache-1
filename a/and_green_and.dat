5|$|On August 3, 2010, Masuda {{announced}} on his blog that the Black and White game versions will initially only contain brand-new Pokémon to evoke {{a feeling of}} it being a brand-new game, like when the original Pokémon games were first released. In all of the games following the first generation, there were a series of new Pokémon introduced interspersed with Pokémon from the previous generations. For example, Pikachu was introduced in Red <b>and</b> <b>Green,</b> <b>and</b> was obtainable in Blue, Yellow, and all subsequent main series games; however, Pikachu will not be obtainable in Black and White {{from the start of}} the game. It was later confirmed that Black and White are region locked on the Nintendo DSi and 3DS.|$|E

5|$|Although he was {{not part}} of Nintendo at the time, Iwata {{assisted}} in the development of Pokémon Gold and Silver, which were released for the Game Boy Color in November1999, by creating a set of compression tools utilized for graphics in the games. While working as a go-between for Game Freak and Nintendo, he aided in the programming of Pokémon Stadium for the Nintendo 64 by reading the original coding in Pokémon Red <b>and</b> <b>Green</b> <b>and</b> porting the battle system into the new game in just one week. According to Tsunekazu Ishihara, the president of The Pokemon Company, Iwata was instrumental in bringing Pokémon to Western markets. While being president of HAL, he developed the plan for localization after reviewing the code for Red/Green, which was then completed by Teruki Murakawa, with the Western releases coming two years after their Japanese release. Additionally, he assisted Masahiro Sakurai in the development of Super Smash Bros. for the Nintendo 64.|$|E
5|$|Biscayne National Park protects four {{distinct}} ecosystems: {{the shoreline}} mangrove swamp, the shallow waters of Biscayne Bay, the coral limestone keys and the offshore Florida Reef. The shoreline swamps {{of the mainland}} and island margins provide a nursery for larval and juvenile fish, molluscs and crustaceans. The bay waters harbor immature and adult fish, seagrass beds, sponges, soft corals, and manatees. The keys are covered with tropical vegetation including endangered cacti and palms, and their beaches provide nesting grounds for endangered sea turtles. Offshore reefs and waters harbor more than 200 species of fish, pelagic birds, whales and hard corals. Sixteen endangered species including Schaus' swallowtail butterflies, smalltooth sawfish, manatees, <b>and</b> <b>green</b> <b>and</b> hawksbill sea turtles may be observed in the park. Biscayne also has a small population of threatened American crocodiles and a few American alligators.|$|E
5|$|Due to the storm's {{projected}} path into Taiwan, the Central Weather Bureau {{issued a}} sea and land warning on August2. Commercial flights between Taiwan <b>and</b> <b>Green</b> <b>and</b> Orchid Islands were cancelled, {{as well as}} rail service along Taiwan's eastern coast. Morakot's passage over southern Taiwan resulted in significant rainfall across the island. Precipitation from the tropical cyclone peaked at 653mm (25.71in) over nearly two days in Taitung County. The rains uprooted trees in southeastern Taitung City and triggered some landslides. Flash flooding was reported in Pingtung County. Additional landslides blocked highways there, and elementary and junior {{high schools in the}} county were forced to close. Power outages also occurred and impacted hundreds of residences. Crop damage ensued from the precipitation, and amounted to over NT$70million (US$2million).|$|E
