40|$|Chidamber and Kemerer {{suite of}} metrics {{were used in}} the study of 3250 classes from five JAVA based {{industrial}} systems. System 1 had 34 classes, System 2 had 318 classes, System 3 383 classes, System 4 1055 classes, and System 5 1460 classes. Metric values were computed for the Lack of Cohesion in Methods (LCOM), Coupling between Object Classes (CBO), Response For a Class (RFC), Number of Children (NOC), Depth of Inheritance (DIT), Weighted Methods per Class (WMC), Number of Public Methods (NPM) and Afferent Coupling (CA). LCOM was used as cohesion variable; CBO, RFC, CA as coupling variables; WMC, NPM, NOC as <b>size</b> variables <b>and</b> DIT as inheritance variable. Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis were used to analyze the results. Tests of hypotheses were carried out to examine if there were significant relationships between cohesion and couplingvariables, cohesion <b>and</b> <b>size</b> variables, cohesion <b>and</b> inheritance variables, coupling and inheritance variables, coupling <b>and</b> <b>size</b> variables, inheritance <b>and</b> <b>size</b> variables. The results of the study showed that in System 1, there were strong significant relationships between cohesion and coupling (CBO, RFC), cohesion <b>and</b> <b>size</b> (WMC,NPM), coupling <b>and</b> <b>size</b> variables (WMC, NPM), and a weak relationship between Affarent coupling CA and inheritance (DIT). In System 2, there were strong significant relationship between cohesion and coupling (CBO, RFC), cohesion <b>and</b> <b>size</b> variables (WMC, NPM), coupling <b>and</b> <b>size</b> (WMC, NPM); a low relationship between coupling by CA and WMC, NOC, and a weak relationship between inheritance DIT and WMC, RFC, NPM. In System 3, there were strong significant relationship between cohesion and coupling (CBO, RFC), cohesion <b>and</b> <b>size</b> (WMC, NPM), coupling <b>and</b> <b>size</b> (WMC, NPM); a low relationship between coupling by CA. In System 4, there were strong significant relationship between cohesion and coupling (RFC), cohesion <b>and</b> <b>size</b> (WMC, NPM), <b>size</b> WMC <b>and</b> <b>Size</b> NPM. There were low relationships between cohesion and coupling (CBO, CA) and weak relationships between inheritance DIT and CA, inheritance <b>and</b> <b>size</b> (WMC).

5|$|Christiansen and Tschopp (2010) {{state that}} {{presence}} of a horny sheath in Hesperosaurus is a strong indication that the plates had primarily a defensive function, as a horn layer would have strengthened the plate {{as a whole and}} provided it with sharp cutting edges. Also the display function would have been reinforced, because the sheath would have increased the visible surface and such horn structures are often brightly colored. Thermoregulation, on the other hand would have been hampered by an extra insulating layer and the smoothness of the surface, but cannot be entirely ruled out as extant cattle and ducks use horns and beaks to dump excess heat despite the keratin covering.
