500|$|Basically we {{were having}} a laugh at a lot of the {{different}} articles that were appearing at that time in different magazines and papers, and they were talking about 'Pop Kylie, Dance Kylie, Sex Kylie' and, you know, with every different release of a single they'd say 'What Kylie is it now?' and it was just becoming a joke. So he, Pedro, cunningly picked up on that <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> should make a video with all the different Kylies, which I was more then [...] happy about, because it was stating the obvious and having a laugh at the same time.|$|E
500|$|Although Karofsky {{begins the}} second season as an {{ordinary}} jock bully, Murphy hinted to Adler {{that there would be}} more in store for the character. According to Adler, Murphy approached him at {{the second season}} premiere <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> <b>we</b> just wrote some really good stuff for you for episode six'." [...] The actor recalls, [...] "I had no idea what that meant, until I read it!" [...] Adler had long wondered why his character behaved the way he did: [...] "I thought there's got to be a reason why he's so angry, why he's such a bully, why he's going {{out of his way to}} make other people's lives a living hell". Although he had considered various ideas for Karofsky—"maybe he was jealous of the glee club, maybe he was gay, maybe a million different things"—when he got the script for that episode he [...] "was just as shocked as anybody else" [...] when his character kissed Kurt, though he [...] "thought it was so awesome that they would allow this character to go there." ...|$|E

Allison, a new member of the Committee, was a talented {{experimental}} physicist and a protégé of Arthur Compton at the University of Chicago. Oliphant [...] "came to a meeting", Allison recalls, [...] "and said 'bomb' in no uncertain terms. He told us we must concentrate every effort on the bomb, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> {{had no right to}} work on power plants or anything but the bomb. The bomb would cost 25 million dollars, he said, and Britain did not have the money or the manpower, so it was up to us." [...] Allison was surprised that Briggs had kept the committee in the dark. Oliphant visited his friend Ernest Lawrence, and also spoke with James Conant and Enrico Fermi. He not only managed to convince the Americans that an atomic bomb was feasible, but also inspired Lawrence to convert his [...] cyclotron into a giant mass spectrometer for isotope separation, a technique Oliphant had pioneered in 1934. Leo Szilard later wrote, [...] "if Congress knew the true history of the atomic energy project, I have no doubt but that it would create a special medal to be given to meddling foreigners for distinguished services, and that Dr Oliphant {{would be the first to}} receive one." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Place Your Hands" [...] {{remains a}} party and {{compilation}} favourite. Reef played a small parody of this for Chris Evans TFI Friday show in the late nineties, for a feature called ‘It’s Your Letters’. Evans claimed that the band had contacted him to stop playing the clip, as fans were apparently singing along at gigs, but these allegations were largely unfounded. However Evans later denied the claims stating he was misquoted. Indeed, the band had written to Evans, however Gary Stringer explained it differently, [...] "We don’t {{want people to think}} that’s all we’re about" [...] and went on [...] "... he’s gone on telly <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> storm offstage whenever someone in the crowd sings that version of it. But no-one ever does sing that version. I think he thinks his influence and power is a lot more widespread than it actually is." ...|$|E

We could not quite get into the beach because of the {{obstacles}} that the Germans had placed under water and also had proximity bombs that would blow up ships. They were having trouble getting the vessels in, so they could not get to the beach, but they got into relatively shallow water. And the door went down on the landing craft, and the captain stood up and said, everyone ashore, and he was cut down by gunfire. And the first lieutenant stood up and said, everyone ashore, and he was cut down by gunfire. And then that left me, Second Lieutenant Gerald Heaney, in charge, and I looked up <b>and</b> <b>said,</b> <b>we</b> are not going out that door; everybody over the side." [...] Unfortunately, the landing craft had stopped in water {{over the heads of}} the soldiers, most of whom were burdened down by packs and equipment. [...] Only by cutting loose their equipment and then swimming to shore could most of them avoid drowning.|$|E

2500|$|Oliphant {{met with}} the S-1 Section. Samuel K. Allison was a new {{committee}} member, a talented experimentalist and a protégé of Compton at the University of Chicago. Oliphant [...] "came to a meeting," [...] Allison recalled, [...] "and said 'bomb' in no uncertain terms. He told us we must concentrate every effort on the bomb <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> {{had no right to}} work on power plants or anything but the bomb. The bomb would cost 25 million dollars, he said, and Britain did not have the money or the manpower, so it was up to us." [...] Allison was surprised that Briggs had kept the committee in the dark. Oliphant then visited his friend Ernest Lawrence to explain the urgency. Lawrence contacted Compton and James B. Conant, who received the final MAUD Report from Thomson on 3 October 1941. Urey and Pegram were sent to the UK to obtain more information. In January 1942, the OSRD was empowered to engage in large engineering projects in addition to research. Without the help of the MAUD Committee the Manhattan Project would have started months behind. Instead they were able to begin thinking about how to create a bomb, not whether it was possible. Historian Margaret Gowing noted that [...] "events that change a time scale by only a few months can nevertheless change history." ...|$|E
2500|$|Its initial {{concept was}} based on a poem Jackson had written and found in a notebook. Jackson's {{original}} lyrics were kept intact, although its structure was altered. Jam commented [...] "The lyrical idea for 'Doesn't Really Matter' is totally hers, but the music and melody was something I had done with one of our drum programmers, Alex Richburg. I thought of it as a slow melody, but we sped it up." [...] Jackson wrote the remaining lyrics overnight. [...] "We ended up with two different choruses," [...] said Jam. [...] "I wrote, 'Nutty, nutty, nutty, my love for you.' and she wrote 'Doesn't really matter.'" [...] "The 'Doesn't really matter' chorus was better but she liked 'Nutty, nutty, nutty' <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> should put it {{at the end of the}} song." [...] Jackson presented three songs including [...] "Doesn't Really Matter" [...] and an early version of [...] "Feels So Right," [...] later included on Jackson's following album. Segal decided [...] "Doesn't Really Matter" [...] was a better fit and a [...] "summertime record." [...] A slightly modified version was included on All for You, featuring an alternate introduction and elements from the song's remix by Rockwilder. The song paved the way for All for You, with Jam stating [...] "All For You" [...] and [...] "Someone to Call My Lover" [...] and all those songs came off the energy of [...] "Doesn’t Really Matter." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{preparation}} she did for the film, actor Aishwarya Rai {{said in an interview}} that both herself and the director Bhansali [...] ".. just like to walk randomly around the sets and [...] "feel". Sometimes I sit quietly and gaze into space or the ground and he captures all that. In fact, the poster picture with me looking away was taken like that. I was looking at the ground, lost in deep thought and he clicked it and told me that he was putting it on his poster. He knows when I am ready to do a scene, when I am in character, and the like. For instance, I delayed going on the set by two days and he did not say anything. He called me on the set <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>we</b> would start shooting in five days. On the second day, I tried hair, make-up, and costume. He told me I was ready to give my first shot and indeed, I was." [...] About the script Bhansali said that he had worked on the script for 18 months and says, [...] "My film is mainstream in terms of budgets, cast and audience and I had to make sure that I did not hurt anyone but evoked a debate." [...] He points out that without star-clout, such themes will not make any impact on the audience or society. [...] "And at least till my screenplay reaches the interval point, I do not start casting my actors." ...|$|E
