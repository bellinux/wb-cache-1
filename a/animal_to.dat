5|$|In 1876, Robert Koch (1843â€“1910) {{established}} that microorganisms can cause disease. He {{found that the}} blood of cattle which were infected with anthrax always had large numbers of Bacillus anthracis. Koch found that he could transmit anthrax from one <b>animal</b> <b>to</b> another by taking {{a small sample of}} blood from the infected animal and injecting it into a healthy one, and this caused the healthy <b>animal</b> <b>to</b> become sick. He also found that he could grow the bacteria in a nutrient broth, then inject it into a healthy animal, and cause illness. Based on these experiments, he devised criteria for establishing a causal link between a microorganism and a disease and these are now known as Koch's postulates. Although these postulates cannot be applied in all cases, they do retain historical importance to the development of scientific thought and are still being used today.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Carpenter {{and colleagues}} {{described}} material {{of a large}} nodosaurid from Utah, discovered in {{a member of the}} Cedar Mountain Formation called the Poison Strip Sandstone, which is contemporaneous with the Cloverly Formation.

In more recent publications, Carpenter no longer refers the Poison Strip <b>animal</b> <b>to</b> Sauropelta, only to the family Nodosauridae.|$|E

5|$|The encounter: Once {{the prey}} detects the wolves, it can either {{approach}} the wolves, stand its ground, or flee. Large prey, such as moose, elk, and muskoxen, usually stand their ground. Should this occur, the wolves hold back, as they require the stimulus of a running <b>animal</b> <b>to</b> proceed with an attack. If the targeted animal stands its ground, the wolves either ignore it, {{or try to}} intimidate it into running.|$|E

5|$|After the Dutch {{settlement}} of South Africa began, the quagga was heavily hunted as it competed with domesticated animals for forage. While some individuals {{were taken to}} zoos in Europe, breeding programs were unsuccessful. The last wild population lived in the Orange Free State, and the quagga was extinct in the wild by 1878. The last captive specimen died in Amsterdam on 12 August 1883. Only one quagga was ever photographed alive and only 23 skins are preserved today. In 1984, the quagga was the first extinct <b>animal</b> <b>to</b> have its DNA analysed, and the Quagga Project is trying to recreate the phenotype of hair coat pattern and related characteristics by selectively breeding Burchell's zebras.|$|E
5|$|After {{the casting}} of stones, animals are {{slaughtered}} {{to commemorate the}} story of Abraham and Ishmael. Traditionally the pilgrims slaughtered the animal themselves, or oversaw the slaughtering. Today many pilgrims buy a sacrifice voucher in Mecca before the greater Hajj begins, which allows an <b>animal</b> <b>to</b> be slaughtered {{in the name of}} God (Allah) on the 10th, without the pilgrim being physically present. Modern abattoirs complete the processing of the meat, which is then sent as charity to poor people around the world.

5|$|Also {{during the}} 1970s, Bill Morris was {{studying}} giant lambeosaurine remains from Baja California. He named them ?L. laticaudus in 1981 (type specimen LACM 17715). Morris used {{a question mark}} in his work because no complete crest had been found for his species, and without it a definitive assignment could not be made. From what was known of the skull, he considered it to be most like Lambeosaurus. He interpreted this species as water-bound, due to features like its size, its tall and narrow tail (interpreted as a swimming adaptation), and weak hip articulations, {{as well as a}} healed broken thigh bone that he thought would have been too much of a handicap for a terrestrial <b>animal</b> <b>to</b> have survived long enough to heal. This species was later (2012) assigned to the new genus Magnapaulia.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the early}} workers in Alberta did not {{recognize}} it at the time, they were finding the remains of juvenile Lambeosaurus as well. These fossils of small-bodied crested duckbills were interpreted as adults of a distinct lineage of hadrosaurids, the subfamily Cheneosaurinae. The first such <b>animal</b> <b>to</b> be named was Trachodon altidens, a left upper jaw (GSC 1092) from the Dinosaur Park Formation described by Lawrence Lambe in 1902. In the same volume, Henry Fairfield Osborn suggested T. altidens could belong to a new genus, which he labelled Didanodon without further discussion. In 2006, Lund and Gates stated that Didanodon altidens was a nomen nudum, without further discussion.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{vary greatly}} in overall shape. Some, {{such as the}} cockles, have shells that are nearly globular; cockles can jump by bending and {{straightening}} their foot. Others, such as the razor clams, are burrowing specialists with elongated shells and a powerful foot adapted for rapid digging. The shipworms, in the family Teredinidae have greatly elongated bodies, but their shell valves are much reduced and restricted to the anterior end of the body, where they function as scraping organs that permit the <b>animal</b> <b>to</b> dig tunnels through wood.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} {{description}} of a Norfolk Spaniel had changed slightly, The Spaniel Club breed standard for a Norfolk Spaniel in 1897 was for the <b>animal</b> <b>to</b> have a coat of either black and white or liver and white which was not curly, a reasonably heavy body and legs which are longer than other field spaniels but shorter than the Irish Water Spaniel, a deep chest with long sloping shoulders and strength in the back and loins, as well as features typical of a spaniel such as lobular ears. This standard also included the requirement for the tail to be docked. In brief, the standard described the Norfolk as simply looking like a large cocker spaniel.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{its closest}} wild cousins (the coyote and golden jackal), the gray wolf is larger and heavier, with a broader snout, shorter ears, a shorter torso and longer tail. It is a slender, powerfully built animal with a large, deeply {{descending}} ribcage, a sloping {{back and a}} heavily muscled neck. The wolf's legs are moderately longer than those of other canids, which enables the <b>animal</b> <b>to</b> move swiftly, and allows it to overcome the deep snow that covers most of its geographical range. The ears are relatively small and triangular. Females tend to have narrower muzzles and foreheads, thinner necks, slightly shorter legs and less massive shoulders than males.|$|E
