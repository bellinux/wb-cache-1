5|$|Although Busoni {{met with}} many other artistic personalities who were also basing {{themselves}} in Switzerland during the war (including Stephan Zweig and James Joyce– the former noting Busoni's extensive drinking) he soon found his circumstances limiting.

When Busoni's former pupil Leo Kestenberg, now <b>an</b> <b>official</b> <b>at</b> the Ministry of Culture in the German Weimar Republic, invited him to return to Germany, with the promise of a teaching post and productions of his operas, he was very glad to take the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Hastert {{announced}} he would support an Armenian Genocide resolution. Analysts noted {{that at the time}} there was a tight congressional race in California, in which the large Armenian community might be important in favor of the Republican incumbent. The resolution, vehemently opposed by Turkey, had passed the Human Rights Subcommittee of the House and the International Relations Committee but Hastert, although first supporting it, withdrew the resolution {{on the eve of the}} full House vote. He explained this by saying that he had received a letter from Bill Clinton asking him to withdraw it, because it would harm U.S. interests. Even though there is no evidence that a payment was made, <b>an</b> <b>official</b> <b>at</b> the Turkish Consulate is said to have claimed in one recording, that was translated by Sibel Edmonds, that the price for Hastert to withdraw the Armenian Genocide resolution would have been at least $500,000.|$|E

25|$|Ginzburg {{suggests}} {{that by the}} 1620s, the benandanti were becoming bolder in their public accusations against alleged witches.

Badou had become unpopular locally as a result, with the inquisitor not taking his claims seriously and proceeding to ignore the situation.

In May 1629 Francesco Brandis, <b>an</b> <b>official</b> <b>at</b> Cividale, {{sent a letter to the}} inquisitor of Aquileia informing him that a twenty-year-old benandante had been arrested for theft and was thus due to be transferred to Venice.|$|E
