5|$|Scottish nineteenth-century Reformed theologian William Cunningham {{also sought}} to <b>articulate</b> <b>a</b> distinctively Reformed {{theology}} of baptism in the modern world. Cunningham preferred the writings of Zwingli on the sacraments, writing that Calvin and later Reformed orthodox theologians overly elevated {{the value of the}} sacraments. He argued that the efficacy of baptism only applies to adults expressing faith in the act of baptism.|$|E
5|$|Anti-Relief partisans opened many {{lines of}} attack against Desha. They said {{his refusal to}} <b>articulate</b> <b>a</b> {{specific}} campaign platform showed {{that he was trying}} to be all things to all people. They assailed his military record, claiming he had only volunteered for service in the War of 1812 after being promised command of a division, that he balked at fighting and discouraged General Harrison's pursuit of the British and Indians, and that he billed excessive expenses to the government after his service. Desha's legislative career was also subject to scrutiny and attack. Anti-Relief partisans claimed that he had espoused certain positions for the sole purpose of pitting the state's agrarian interests against its aristocracy. They charged that he had secretly favored the Compensation Act of 1816 and had worked to pass it, despite his vote against it. In contrast to his rhetoric in favor of a strong, well-equipped army and navy, opponents claimed he had actually voted against increasing the military's budget. As further evidence of his lack of trustworthiness, they pointed to his vote for William H. Crawford while serving as a presidential elector in 1816, even though Kentuckians were nearly unanimous in their support of James Monroe.|$|E

25|$|The French {{mathematician}} Henri Poincaré {{was among}} the first to <b>articulate</b> <b>a</b> conventionalist view. Poincaré's use of non-Euclidean geometries in his work on differential equations convinced him that Euclidean geometry should not be regarded as a priori truth. He held that axioms in geometry should be chosen for the results they produce, not for their apparent coherence with human intuitions about the physical world.|$|E
25|$|In the {{relatively}} permissive environment of Western host societies, Tamil diaspora association have articulated Tamil grievances, something that many argued {{was not possible}} because of repression in Sri Lanka (see, e.g., Ilankai Tamil Sangam, n.d.). This activism stands {{in contrast to the}} marked lack of participation by Tamils in contemporary Sri Lankan civil society and the impossibility of gauging the views of northeastern Tamils during the conflict. Tamil diaspora activists claim to fill this gap, especially as it is illegal to <b>articulate</b> <b>a</b> Tamil secessionist position in Sri Lanka.|$|E
25|$|In 1811, Venezuelan {{translator}} Manuel Garcia de Sena {{published a}} book in Philadelphia which consisted mostly of Spanish translations of several of Paine's most important works. The book also included translations of the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, the U.S. Constitution, and the constitutions of five U.S. states. It subsequently circulated widely in South America, and through it, Uruguayan national hero José Gervasio Artigas became familiar with and embraced Paine's ideas. In turn, many of Artigas's writings drew directly from Paine's, including the Instructions of 1813, which Uruguayans consider {{to be one of}} their country's most important constitutional documents; {{it was one of the}} earliest writings to <b>articulate</b> <b>a</b> principled basis for an identity independent of Buenos Aires.|$|E

25|$|Assuming that {{a problem}} exists, many have offered {{suggestions}} for narrowing the gap and correcting the problems arising from it. In general, those suggestions are along three lines. The first is that the military must {{reach out to the}} civilian world. Given the essentially universal agreement that civilians must control the military, the duty falls upon the military to find ways to talk to civilians, not the other way around. The second is that civilians must <b>articulate</b> <b>a</b> clear vision of what they expect in terms of the military mission. And the final suggestion is that the most practical and effective means of bringing about dialogue and understanding is to be bilateral education, in which both military and civilian elites would jointly attend specialized schools. Such schooling would emphasize military-strategic thinking, American history and political philosophy, military ethics, and the proper relationship between civil and military authority.|$|E
500|$|Heavily {{influenced}} by Rousseau's frank and revealing Confessions (1782), Wollstonecraft lays bare her soul in Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, detailing {{not only her}} physical but also her psychological journey. Her personal disclosures, like those of other female autobiographers, are presented as [...] "unpremeditated self-revelations" [...] and often appear to be [...] "circuitous". However, as Wollstonecraft scholar Mitzi Myers has made clear, Wollstonecraft manages to use this style of writing to <b>articulate</b> <b>a</b> stable and comprehensible self for the reader. Increasingly confident in her ability as a writer, she controls the narrative {{and its effect on}} readers to a degree not matched in her other works. She transforms the individual sorrows of her trip, such as the dissolution of her relationship with Imlay, into the stuff of gripping literature.|$|E
500|$|Within the BNP, Tyndall {{established}} an elite {{group known as}} Spearhead, members of which wore military-style uniforms inspired by those of the Nazis and underwent paramilitary and ideological training. Tyndall had a great liking for wearing jackboots; Jordon related that {{on the way to}} a far-right meeting in Germany, Tyndall made his entourage look for a shoe shop so that he could purchase a pair of genuine German jackboots. It is likely that there were no more than sixty members of Spearhead. The group campaigned on behalf of imprisoned Nazi war criminals Rudolf Hess and Adolf Eichmann. According to the anti-fascist activist Gerry Gable, Spearhead represented the first [...] "terrorist group" [...] founded by Neo-Nazis in Britain. Both Bean and another senior BNP member, Andrew Fountaine, were concerned about the overt Neo-Nazism embraced by Tyndall and Jordan, instead thinking that the BNP should <b>articulate</b> <b>a</b> more British-oriented form of racial nationalism. In 1962, Bean held a meeting at which Tyndall and Jordan were expelled from the party.|$|E

500|$|Whitehead has {{had some}} {{influence}} on philosophy of business administration and organizational theory. [...] This has led {{in part to a}} focus on identifying and investigating the effect of temporal events (as opposed to static things) within organizations through an “organization studies” discourse that accommodates a variety of 'weak' and 'strong' process perspectives from a number of philosophers. [...] One of the leading figures having an explicitly Whiteheadian and panexperientialist stance towards management is Mark Dibben, who works in what he calls [...] "applied process thought" [...] to <b>articulate</b> <b>a</b> philosophy of management and business administration as part of a wider examination of the social sciences through the lens of process metaphysics. For Dibben, this allows [...] "a comprehensive exploration of life as perpetually active experiencing, as opposed to occasional – and thoroughly passive – happening." [...] Dibben has published two books on applied process thought, [...] (2008), and [...] (2009), as well as other papers in this vein in the fields of philosophy of management and business ethics.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{critical}} acclaim [...] "Ulysses" [...] received, its rise within the Tennyson canon took decades. Tennyson did not usually select it {{for publication in}} poetry anthologies; in teaching anthologies, however, the poem was usually included—and it remains a popular teaching poem today. Its current prominence in Tennyson's oeuvre {{is the result of}} two trends, according to Tennyson scholar Matthew Rowlinson: the rise of formal English poetry studies in the late nineteenth century, and the Victorian effort to <b>articulate</b> <b>a</b> British culture that could be exported. He argues that [...] "Ulysses" [...] forms part of the prehistory of imperialism—a term that only appeared in the language in 1851. The protagonist sounds like a [...] "colonial administrator", and his reference to seeking a newer world (57) echoes the phrase [...] "New World", which became common during the Renaissance. While [...] "Ulysses" [...] cannot be read as overtly imperialistic, Tennyson's later work as Poet Laureate sometimes argues for the value of Britain's colonies, or was accused of jingoism. Rowlinson invokes the Marxist theorist Louis Althusser's extension of the argument that ideology is ahistorical, finding that Tennyson's poem [...] "comes before an ideological construction for which it nonetheless makes people nostalgic".|$|E
500|$|Jon Pareles from The New York Times {{felt that}} Madonna {{tried to be}} honest with the concept of American Dream in the album, but ended up {{producing}} songs akin to the [...] "folkie psychobabble" [...] of songwriters like Jewel. James Hannaham from Spin compared the album's introspective themes to her previous albums Ray of Light and Music and also noted Madonna spends much of American Life bemoaning the emptiness of celebrity culture. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian responded well to parts of the record saying [...] "American Lifes best tracks make a mockery of virtually all other current pop music" [...] however his conclusive point in the review was that there was not enough of good songs. The Village Voices Jessica Winter called Madonna's voice [...] "redundant" [...] and commented that [...] "she ironizes 'the American dream' only to pitch woo at her English husband and <b>articulate</b> <b>a</b> vague yet fiery frustration with her outrageously privileged station in the world". Ed Howard from Stylus Magazine gave the album a negative review calling the album [...] "about Madonna" [...] instead of American culture explaining, [...] "it's Madonna who, surprisingly, has simply run out of things to say". BBC's Ian Young also gave a negative review, saying that [...] "the tunes are bland and weak, the lyrics are uninspired and self-absorbed and the semi-Ibiza backing music is bare and recycled—and we are convinced that she has lost it." ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{present study}} aims to {{identify}} the rhetorical pattern of sampled English abstracts of papers presented at the FISS Conference on April 9 and 10 2011 in the University Putra Malaysia (UPM), Malaysia.

The data of the study were drawn from the above-mentioned conference proceedings. The aim of the study is {{to identify the}} elements of generic structural potential (GSP) and their sequence which construct the rhetorical pattern of abstract texts. The findings revealed six rhetorically structural elements which include four obligatory elements of Addressing <b>a</b> Framework (AF), <b>Articulating</b> <b>an</b> Objective (AO), <b>Articulating</b> <b>a</b> Method (AM), and <b>Articulating</b> <b>a</b> Result (AR) and two optional rhetorical elements such as Providing Background Information (BI) and Addressing a Problem (AP).
