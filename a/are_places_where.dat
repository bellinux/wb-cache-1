They <b>are</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> the deities live and {{where all the}} living things are either sacred or are companions of the gods. Folklore lays down the supernatural {{penalties}} that will result if desecration takes place for example by the felling of trees. Because of their protected status, sacred groves {{may be the only}} relicts of ancient forest and have a biodiversity much greater than the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|Yarralumla {{is located}} on the Yarralumla Formation which is a mudstone/siltstone {{formation}} that was formed around 425 million years ago during the Silurian Period. The formation extends from Red Hill and Woden in the South to Lake Burley Griffin in to the north, passing under the suburb of Yarralumla. The formation is evidence of the last major marine sedimentary period when eastern Australia was still covered by shallow seas. It shows fossil evidence of trilobites, coral and primitive crinoids. The Yarralumla brickworks quarry and the Deakin anticline <b>are</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> the formation is exposed and easily studied.|$|E
5|$|Cathedrals <b>are</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> the Christian rituals {{particular}} to a bishop, especially ordination and enthronement, can be performed, and are structured and furnished for these purposes. Each cathedral contains {{the seat of}} the local bishop, often literally a large throne. The bishop's throne is located towards the eastern end of the cathedral, near the high altar, which is main focus of worship. On the altar is served the Eucharist, a symbolic meal of bread and wine in memory of Jesus’ last supper with his disciples. In the early Medieval period, the altar always contained, or was associated with, the relics of a saint. Sometimes the relics were held in a separate shrine, near the high altar. In this part of the church are often located the tombs of former bishops, typically arranged either side of the major shrine, so the worshipping congregation symbolically comprised the whole body of clergy of the diocese, both living and dead, in communion with their patron saint. Seats are provided for the other significant clergy of the cathedral: the dean who is the foremost priest at the cathedral, the precentor, sacristan, archdeacon and canons.|$|E

25|$|Another way males get to {{mate with}} several females is {{through the use of}} leks. Leks <b>are</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> many fish come together, and the males display to each another. Based on these displays, each female then selects the male they want to be their mate. For example, among the cichlid Cyrtocara eucinostomus in Lake Malawi, up to 50,000 large and {{colourful}} males display together on a lek four kilometres long. The females, which are mouth brooders, choose which male they want to fertilize their eggs.|$|E
25|$|Both {{critics and}} {{promoters}} of the Book of Mormon have used linguistic methods {{to analyze the}} text. Promoters have published claims of stylistic forms that Joseph Smith and his contemporaries are unlikely to have known about, as well as similarities to Egyptian and Hebrew. Critics of the Book of Mormon claim there <b>are</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> the language is anachronistic and suggestive of a 19th-century origin consistent with Smith's upbringing and life experience, {{as well as the}} books and other literature published just preceding the time that the Book of Mormon was published.|$|E
25|$|Interlockings <b>are</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> {{tracks are}} {{connected}} by switches and where routes may conflict. They {{are arranged in}} a specific way, with switches and signals that prevent conflicting movements once one route is set up. Interlocking signals are fixed signals within an interlocking, containing two separate red-yellow-green signal heads and often other indications. A home signal is defined as an interlocking signal {{at the entrance to}} a route or block to control trains entering that route or block. These terms are used interchangeably, as most interlockings only have one controlled signal on each track.|$|E

25|$|Kent's {{only real}} {{downfall}} {{was said to}} be his lack of horticultural knowledge and technical skill (which people like Charles Bridgeman possessed – whose impact on Kent is often underestimated), but his naturalistic style of design was his major contribution to the history of landscape design. Claremont, Stowe, and Rousham <b>are</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> their joint efforts can be viewed. Stowe and Rousham are Kent's most famous works. At the latter, Kent elaborated on Bridgeman's 1720s design for the property, adding walls and arches to catch the viewer's eye. At Stowe, Kent used his Italian experience, particularly with the Palladian Bridge. At both sites Kent incorporated his naturalistic approach.|$|E
25|$|The {{architectural}} form which cathedrals took was largely dependent upon their ritual {{function as the}} seat of a bishop. Cathedrals <b>are</b> <b>places</b> <b>where,</b> in common with other Christian churches, the Eucharist is celebrated, the Bible is read, the Order of Service is said or sung, prayers are offered and sermons are preached. But in a cathedral, in general, these things are done with a greater amount of elaboration, pageantry and procession than in lesser churches. This elaboration is particularly present during important liturgical rites performed by a Bishop, such as Confirmation and Ordination. A cathedral is often the site of rituals associated with local or national Government, the Bishops performing the tasks of all sorts from the induction of a mayor to the coronation of a monarch. Some of these tasks are apparent in the form and fittings of particular cathedrals.|$|E

2500|$|Subduction zones <b>are</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> two plates, {{usually an}} oceanic plate and a {{continental}} plate, collide. In this case, the oceanic plate subducts, or submerges, under the continental plate, forming a {{deep ocean trench}} just offshore. In a process called flux melting, water released from the subducting plate lowers the melting temperature of the overlying mantle wedge, thus creating magma. This magma tends to be extremely [...] viscous because of its high silica content, so it often does not attain the surface but cools and solidifies at depth. [...] When it does reach the surface, however, a volcano is formed. Typical examples are Mount Etna and the volcanoes in the Pacific Ring of Fire.|$|E
2500|$|The Mauritian tomb bat {{is often}} found in groups of around five individuals. These groups are usually either made up of entirely male or female individuals; when they are found in mixed gender groups, the two sexes are {{separated}} by at least 100mm. [...] Females live together in groups of three to thirty, while males live alone except during the mating season. Unlike some species of bats, they do not roost close together in tight packs; instead they are found spaced out loosely, {{with the exception of}} a mother and her offspring. There <b>are</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> groups of at least a hundred bats have been found, one example being the Shai Hills Resource Reserve in Ghana.|$|E
2500|$|Roman and Wilgus, who {{developed}} comics {{based on the}} series for Nick Magazine, consulted series creators Mike Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, and head writer for the show Aaron Ehasz while they were developing Zuko's Story. The four wanted to try a comic that would fit into with {{the continuity of the}} show. The prequel, though mostly associated with the film, {{was meant to be a}} prequel to the series. Roman explained, [...] "In a lot of ways, it's like an expanded origin. With the film and the series, there are differences and there <b>are</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> they split off, but the setup for both is exactly the same — so when you're introduced to the characters, that's the part where they're completely identical." [...] The prequel allowed the expansions of different details told in the series; for example, an episode called [...] "The Blue Spirit" [...] in the series was seen in the film. However, since explaining everything that happened in that episode was hard to translate onto film, the prequel allowed for them to [...] "delve" [...] into that specific story. What more, when asked about whether he answered some questions that were left open at the end of the series, Roman stated that, while he had a strong relationship with the show's creators and got their blessing for his project, it wasn't his plot to address.|$|E

2500|$|Sporobolomyces salmonicolor has a broad {{geographical}} distribution. It {{has been}} isolated from many areas {{across the world}} including Europe, North and South America, Asia, Africa and Antarctica where it is known from {{a broad spectrum of}} substrates. It is principally characterized as a phyllosphere fungus and is commonly found in areas of decaying organic material such as leaves and grains as well as ripening grapes. Isolates of this species however have been recovered from freshwater, marine water and clinical specimens. [...] It has also been isolated from agricultural areas and indoor built environments. In agricultural environments, Sporobolomyces salmonicolor can pose a respiratory hazard for agricultural workers. Agricultural workers are subject to increased exposure when they partake in activities involving the handling of grains. Sporobolomyces salmonicolor has additionally been isolated from straw in hay barns or hay lofts. Workers in these settings should consider the proper use of masks to avoid infection. If individuals show atopic symptoms, a change in occupation might be considered. In indoor environments, S.salmonicolor has been associated with severe water and mould damage. Flooded basements and utility rooms <b>are</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> S.salmonicolor may be recovered. This fungus will also commonly associate with standing water films, although not very much has been documented on this. It can form a pink water film around stagnant toilet water. The most efficient way to avoid exposure in the home is to eliminate moisture sources and keep bathrooms clean, dry and ventilated.|$|E
2500|$|As per Shiv Mahapuran, once Brahma (the Hindu God of creation) and Vishnu (the Hindu God of saving) had an {{argument}} {{in terms of}} supremacy of creation.

[...] Vishnu and Brahma split their ways to downwards and upwards respectively to find {{the end of the}} light in either directions. [...] Brahma lied that he found out the end, while Vishnu conceded his defeat. [...] Shiva appeared as a second pillar of light and cursed Brahma that he would have no place in ceremonies while Vishnu would be worshipped till the end of eternity. [...] The jyotirlinga is the supreme partless reality, out of which Shiva partly appears. [...] The jyothirlinga shrines, thus <b>are</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> Shiva appeared as a fiery column of light.

[...] Each of the twelve jyothirlinga sites take the name of the presiding deity - each considered a different manifestation of Shiva. [...] At all these sites, the primary image is the lingam representing the Stambha pillar, symbolizing the infinite nature of Shiva (without beginning or end).
