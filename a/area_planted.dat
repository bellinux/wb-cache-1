25|$|The Wellington/Wairarapa {{wine-growing}} region {{is one of}} New Zealand's smallest, with several sub-regions, which include Gladstone, Martinborough, Masterton, and Opaki. Martinborough was the original <b>area</b> <b>planted,</b> {{on the basis of}} careful scientific study, in the 1970s, which identified its soils and climate as perfectly suited to the cultivation of Pinot noir. As a consequence, many of the vineyards established there are older than their counterparts {{in the rest of the}} Wairarapa. Subtle differences are seen in the wines from the South Wairarapa (which includes Martinborough), which has more maritime influences, to those grown further north.|$|E
25|$|Central Otago {{with the}} second highest <b>area</b> <b>planted,</b> has strong, sweet plum and cherry {{flavours}} and thyme notes. In wines from cooler sub-regions there are edgier qualities with fresh herb, spice and pronounced mineral flavours. Wairarapa produces wines that are lighter, softer and more supple. Waipara in Canterbury has two styles. Wines produced on the flat valley floor are lighter and supple and have a bias toward red fruits. Pinot produced on the surrounding hills appear more concentrated, with dark fruit flavours and occasionally with a chalk/mineral influence. Nelson is similarly divided into two sub-regions with the Waimea plains producing accessible wines with vibrant acidity and those from the Moutere Valley producing wine that is richer, more concentrated and structured.|$|E

25|$|But Bt cotton is {{ineffective}} against many cotton pests, however, such as plant bugs, stink bugs, and aphids; {{depending on}} circumstances it {{may still be}} desirable to use insecticides against these. A 2006 study done by Cornell researchers, the Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy and the Chinese Academy of Science on Bt cotton farming in China found that after seven years these secondary pests that were normally controlled by pesticide had increased, necessitating the use of pesticides at similar levels to non-Bt cotton and causing less profit for farmers because of the extra expense of GM seeds. However, a 2009 study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Stanford University and Rutgers University refuted this. They concluded that the GM cotton effectively controlled bollworm. The secondary pests were mostly miridae (plant bugs) whose increase was related to local temperature and rainfall and only continued to increase in half the villages studied. Moreover, the increase in insecticide use for the control of these secondary insects was far smaller than the reduction in total insecticide use due to Bt cotton adoption. A 2012 Chinese study concluded that Bt cotton halved the use of pesticides and doubled the level of ladybirds, lacewings and spiders. The International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA) said that, worldwide, GM cotton was planted on an area of 25 million hectares in 2011. This was 69% of the worldwide total <b>area</b> <b>planted</b> in cotton.|$|E
