5|$|As of 2014, Spokane {{is still}} trying to make the {{transition}} to a more service-oriented economy {{in the face of a}} less prominent manufacturing sector. Developing the city's strength in the medical and health sciences fields has seen some success, resulting in the expansion of the University District with two medical school branches. The city faces challenges such as <b>a</b> <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> high-paying jobs, pockets of poverty, and areas of high crime.|$|E
5|$|The nunatak {{areas have}} <b>a</b> <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> flora, limited to lichen, {{bryophyte}} and algae. Flowering plants are not found there. The Norwegian Polar Institute has not registered {{the occurrence of}} any threatened or rare plants or animals in Queen Maud Land, the known ones thus existing in healthy populations.|$|E
5|$|These {{developments}} {{placed the}} regency in considerable difficulties. In spite of Apokaukos' adroit {{management of the}} state's finances, the devastation caused by the prolonged wars had emptied the treasury. In August 1343, Empress Anna was forced to pawn the crown jewels to Venice for 30,000 ducats. In addition, Turkish ravages in Thrace led to <b>a</b> <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> food in Constantinople. Hoping for Western aid, Anna appealed to the Pope, promising the submission of herself, John V, Apokaukos and even the Patriarch to his authority, and began persecuting the pro-Kantakouzenists and anti-Western Palamists.|$|E

50|$|An {{evolutionary}} psychology explanation for dowry and bride price is that bride price {{is common in}} polygynous societies which have <b>a</b> relative <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> available women. In monogamous societies where women have little personal wealth, dowry is instead common since there is <b>a</b> relative <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> wealthy men who can choose from many potential women when marrying.|$|R

5|$|With {{an economy}} {{fundamentally}} dependent upon a single industry, there was <b>a</b> <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> paid employment {{for women in}} Rhondda's coalmining heyday. The Encyclopaedia of Wales notes {{that the image of}} the Welsh Mam, a wife and mother constantly at home and exalted as the queen of the household, was essentially a Rhondda creation. However the Rhondda did produce the suffragette and social reformer Elizabeth Andrews, one of only nine women among a list of a hundred greatest Welsh heroes chosen by ballot in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Glacier is {{considered}} to have excellent air and water quality. No major areas of dense human population exist anywhere near the region and industrial effects are minimized due to <b>a</b> <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> factories and other potential contributors of pollutants. However, the sterile and cold lakes found throughout the park are easily contaminated by airborne pollutants that fall whenever it rains or snows, and some evidence of these pollutants {{has been found in}} park waters. Wildfires could also impact the quality of water. However, the pollution level is currently viewed as negligible, and the park lakes and waterways have a water quality rating of A-1, the highest rating given by the state of Montana.|$|E
5|$|The Zoroastrians {{moved to}} India in {{successive}} migrations in the Islamic period. The initial migration following the conquest {{has been characterized}} as a religious persecution by invading Muslims. According to the account, the Zoroastrians suffered at their hands {{and in order to}} protect themselves and safeguard their religion, fled first to northern Iran, then to the island of Hormuz and finally to India. This generally accepted narrative of migration emphasises Muslim persecution while identifying Parsis as religious refugees. Recently, scholars have questioned this explanation of Iranian origins. There is <b>a</b> <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> sources about the migration. Historians are forced to rely exclusively on Qissa-i Sanjan written in 1599 by a Parsi Priest and Qissah-ye Zartushtian-e Hindustan written more than 200 years later. This is {{complicated by the fact that}} there were already Zoroastrians in India in the Sasanian period. According to the legend, at the beginning of the 10th century a small group of Zoroastrians living around the town of Nyshapour and Fort of Sanjan in the province of (greater) Khorasan, decided that Iran was no longer safe for Zoroastrians and their religion.The refugees accepted the conditions and founded the settlement of Sanjan (Gujarat), which is said to have been named after the city of their origin (Sanjan, near Merv, in present-day Turkmenistan).|$|E

5|$|The nymph is the {{dominant}} life history stage of the mayfly. Different insect species vary in their tolerance to water pollution, but in general, the larval stages of mayflies, stoneflies (Plecoptera) and caddis flies (Trichoptera) are susceptible {{to a number of}} pollutants including sewage, pesticides and industrial effluent. In general, mayflies are particularly sensitive to acidification, but tolerances vary, and certain species are exceptionally tolerant to heavy metal contamination and to low pH levels. Ephemerellidae are among the most tolerant groups and Siphlonuridae and Caenidae the least. The adverse effects on the insects of pollution may be either lethal or sub-lethal, in the latter case resulting in altered enzyme function, poor growth, changed behaviour or lack of reproductive success. As important parts of the food chain, pollution can cause knock-on effects to other organisms; a dearth of herbivorous nymphs can cause overgrowth of algae, and <b>a</b> <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> predacious nymphs can result in an over-abundance of their prey species. Fish that feed on mayfly nymphs that have bioaccumulated heavy metals are themselves at risk. Adult female mayflies find water by detecting the polarization of reflected light. They are easily fooled by other polished surfaces which can act as traps for swarming mayflies.|$|E

50|$|Early life in Chalk Creek was difficult, {{and during}} winters the {{settlers}} dealt with <b>a</b> constant <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> food.

25|$|Later {{that day}} Darlan ordered a ceasefire and Vichy French forces began, en masse, {{to join the}} Free French cause.

25|$|In Ireland, the Wartime {{period is}} {{referred}} to as The Emergency. There was <b>a</b> <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> goods, as trade between Britain and Ireland was badly disrupted – though some households had stocked up on certain supplies before the outbreak of War.

25|$|While the {{influence}} of Scandinavian language was strongest in dialects in the Danelaw region and Scotland, the spoken words crept into the language in the tenth and eleventh centuries near {{the transition from the}} Old to Middle English period, but such borrowed words only appeared in the Middle English writing {{at the beginning of the}} thirteenth century, likely because of <b>a</b> <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> literary texts from an earlier date.|$|E
25|$|Countries {{who have}} {{produced}} many successful skaters {{in recent decades}} include Russia and the former Soviet Union, the United States, Canada, Japan, China, France, Germany, and Italy. While the sport has grown in East Asia, training opportunities in South Asia are limited due to <b>a</b> <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> ice rinks. India had only four major indoor ice rinks as of 2011, but there were plans for ten more to be built, mostly in malls, over the following five years.|$|E
25|$|Locks 58-71 are {{composite}} locks. Because {{there was}} <b>a</b> <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> good building {{stone in the}} upper Potomac, they made those locks of rubble and undressed inferior stone.

The wood sheathing had to be replaced from time to time. Originally kyanized wood was used.|$|E
