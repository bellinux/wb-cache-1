40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{association}} between audit committee characteristics {{and the establishment of}} <b>a</b> risk <b>management</b> <b>committee</b> by Malaysian listed firms. The study predicts that firms with more independent, expert, and diligent audit committees are likely to establish <b>a</b> stand-alone risk <b>management</b> <b>committee.</b> It is also expected that audit committees with more members are also likely to support the establishment of <b>a</b> risk <b>management</b> <b>committee.</b> The study employs a cross-sectional analysis of 690 firms listed on the Bursa Malaysia for the financial year ending in 2003. A logistic regression analysis is used to estimate the relationships proposed in the hypotheses. The study finds a strong support for an association between the establishment of risk <b>management</b> <b>committee</b> and audit committee independence, audit committee size, and audit committee diligence. The results also show that the establishment of <b>a</b> risk <b>management</b> <b>committee</b> is positively and significantly associated with firm-specific variables such as firm size, complexity of a firm’s operations, and the use of Big Four audit firm...|$|R
500|$|Busby {{organised}} {{a meeting}} at St. Andrew's Hall, {{not far from the}} Queen's Hall. Invitations were sent to present and former members of the Queen's Hall Orchestra. About a hundred players attended. Busby explained the scheme: a new ensemble, the London Symphony Orchestra, to be run on co-operative lines, [...] "something akin to a Musical Republic", with a constitution that gave the organisation independence. At concerts promoted by the LSO the members played without fee, their remuneration coming {{at the end of each}} season in a division of the orchestra's profits. This worked well in good years, but any poorly-patronised series left members out of pocket, and reliant on the LSO's engagements to play for provincial choral societies and other managements. The proposal was approved unanimously, and <b>a</b> <b>management</b> <b>committee</b> was elected, comprising the four original movers and Alfred Hobday (viola) and E F (Fred) James (bassoon). Busby was appointed chief executive, a post variously titled [...] "Secretary", [...] "Managing Director", [...] "General Secretary" [...] and [...] "General Manager" [...] over the years.|$|E
500|$|The {{navigation}} was {{not initially}} profitable, {{and the amount}} of money owing to the undertakers gradually rose to a peak of £19,659 by 1740. Toll receipts improved, and by 1757, the debts had been reduced to £9,809. In September 1757, merchants from Liverpool complained about the run-down state of the navigation to Liverpool Corporation, who offered to pay for a survey. The merchants then offered to take over the navigation, but the commissioners wanted to keep control of it, and paid £17,000 to the undertakers, which repaid the outstanding debt and bought the navigation rights. The deal was completed on 11 October 1758. The commissioners largely ignored the survey which had been carried out by Henry Berry, and decided to enlarge the locks to [...] wide. Work began on a new cut, lock and weir at Pickerings, but in 1759, the navigation was cut in half by the collapse of a salt pit at Northwich. The commissioners discovered that they could not sue for damages, as the provisions of the 1721 Act no longer covered {{the way in which they}} were operating, and so a second Act of Parliament was obtained on 22 May 1760. This changed the way in which the debts were managed, and gave the commissioners powers to sue and to appoint <b>a</b> <b>management</b> <b>committee.</b> It also stipulated that all locks should be [...] with a draught of , but the actual depth exceeded [...]|$|E
