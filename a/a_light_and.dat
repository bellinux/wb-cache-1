5|$|Combat in Armada of the Damned {{was split}} between land and sea. Sterling had <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> a heavy attack, {{which could be}} {{combined}} to create combos that increased the damage he inflicted. Correct timing lead to a bonus attack {{at the end of}} the combo that improved its strength. Sterling could also curse his opponents. The curse was a spell that weakened all surrounding enemies when it was used as a finishing move. All attacks, special moves, and combinations varied depending of the pirate type chosen and could be upgraded at will.|$|E
5|$|Crash {{can perform}} both <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> heavy-powered attack. He can also block, dodge-and-counter, or break an enemy's block.

5|$|The {{songs and}} musical score {{used in the}} film were {{composed}} and written by Carlo Savina and Gilbert Kaplan. The songs were sung by Kaplan and Ann Collin. The music resembles Riz Ortolani's score from Africa addio, as most tracks are of <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> upbeat nature, particularly during the opening and closing credits. The arrangement of music to enhance atmosphere and create comic effect also mimics the compositions in Africa addio.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of tracheal intubations involve {{the use of a}} viewing instrument of one type or another. The modern conventional laryngoscope consists of a handle containing batteries that power <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> a set of interchangeable blades, which are either straight or curved. This device is designed to allow the laryngoscopist to directly view the larynx. Due to the widespread availability of such devices, the technique of blind intubation of the trachea is rarely practiced today, although it may still be useful in certain emergency situations, such as natural or man-made disasters. In the prehospital emergency setting, digital intubation may be necessitated if the patient is in a position that makes direct laryngoscopy impossible. For example, digital intubation may be used by a paramedic if the patient is entrapped in an inverted position in a vehicle after a motor vehicle collision with a prolonged extrication time.|$|E

This technique was, however, expensive and therefore it was abandoned in subsequent designs.|$|E
25|$|Although an {{occlusive}} tumor may be suspected on a {{barium swallow}} or barium meal, {{the diagnosis is}} best made with an examination using an endoscope. This involves the passing of a flexible tube with <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> camera down the esophagus and examining the wall, and is called an esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Biopsies taken of suspicious lesions are then examined histologically for signs of malignancy.|$|E
25|$|During Xianghua's early design phase, several {{concepts}} {{were considered}} for her attire, before settling upon <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> oriental appearance for her. Additionally {{it was considered}} to have her appear {{as a young girl}} instead, or alternatively for her to fight unarmed using martial arts, an idea later put to effect through Tekken character Heihachi Mishima in his guest appearance in Soulcalibur II.

25|$|The {{translation}} of Thomas Taylor (1887) {{has given rise}} to a conception of Melinoe as half-black, half-white, representing the duality of the heavenly Zeus and the infernal Pluto. This had been the interpretation of Gottfried Hermann in his annotated text of the hymns in 1805. This duality may be implicit, like the explanation offered by Servius for why the poplar leaf has <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> dark side to represent Leuke ("White"), a nymph loved by Pluto. The Orphic text poses interpretational challenges for translators in this passage.|$|E
25|$|Depictions of the {{character}} have varied spanning the comics and other media adaptations. The original Golden Age version of Lois Lane, as well as versions of her from the 1970s onwards, portrays Lois as a tough-as-nails journalist and intellectually equal to Superman. During the Silver Age of Comics, she was the star of Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane, a comic book series that had <b>a</b> <b>light</b> <b>and</b> humorous tone.
