40|$|<b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>length</b> is an idiomatic English phrase {{which refers}} to a metaphor that uses the human body as a measure.

40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of three chapters. In Chapter I (Price Caps with Capacity Precommitment), we study the effectiveness of price cap regulation in a monopolistic setting under demand uncertainty. In our model, a monopolist facing an uncertain demand. In the absence of capacity precommitment, price caps remain an effective regulatory instrument, {{just as they are}} when demand is deterministic. Price caps are also an effective instrument to regulate a monopoly that makes irreversible capacity investments ex-ante, and then chooses its output up to capacity upon observing the realization of demand. In this scenario, however, the optimal price cap must trade off the incentives for capacity investment and capacity withholding, is well above the unit cost of capacity and, when the unit cost of capacity is low, is below the price cap that maximizes capacity. Moreover, a price cap alone cannot eliminate inefficiencies. Under standard regularity assumptions on the demand distribution, the comparative static properties of price caps above the optimal price cap are analogous to those they have in the absence of capacity precommitment. The Chapter II and Chapter III are aimed at analyzing the competitive consequences of imposition of the <b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>Length</b> Principle (ALP, henceforth) requirements for international transfer pricing. In order to discourage tax shifting activities by multinational fi rms, most countries follow taxation policies that are based on the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations, which recommend that, for tax purposes, internal pricing policies be consistent with ALP (i. e., that transfer prices between companies of multinational enterprises for tax purposes be established on a market value basis, thus comparable to transactions between independent, unrelated, parties). Moreover, ALP puts associated and independent enterprises on a more equal footing for tax purposes, it avoids the creation of tax advantages that would otherwise distort the relative competitive positions of either type of entity. The failure to comply with the ALP may result in a penalty. The OECD s recommendation that transfer prices between parent firms and their subsidiaries be consistent with the ALP for tax purposes does not restrict internal pricing policies. In Chapter II (Strategic Incentives for Keeping One Set of Books under the <b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>Length</b> Principle), we show that under imperfect competition parent rms accounting policies determine the properties of market outcomes: if parents keep one set of books (i. e., their internal transfer prices are consistent with the ALP), then competition in the external (home) market softens (intensi es) relative to an equilibrium where parent fi rms and subsidiaries are integrated. In contrast, if rms keep two sets of books (i. e., their internal transfer prices differ from those used for tax purposes) or maintain asymmetric accounting policies, then competition intensi es in both markets. Keeping one set of books turns out to be an equilibrium for most of the parameter space. In Chapter III (The Non-Neutrality of the <b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>Length</b> Principle with Imperfect Competition), we show that under imperfect competition the <b>Arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>Length</b> Principle is non-neutral: a strict (lax) application of the ALP softens competition among subsidiaries (parents). Thus, under imperfect competition regulating transfer pricing optimally requires trading off its impact on market outcomes and tax revenue...|$|R

40|$|Many studies into {{construction}} procurement methods reveal {{evidence of}} a {{need to change the}} culture and attitude in the construction industry, transition from traditional adversarial relationships to cooperative and collaborative relationships. At the same time there is also increasing concern and discussion on alternative procurement methods, involving a movement away from traditional procurement systems. Relational contracting approaches, such as partnering and relationship management, are business strategies that align the objectives of clients, commercial participants and stakeholders. It provides a collaborative environment and a framework for all participants to adapt their behaviour to project objectives and allows for engagement of those subcontractors and suppliers down the supply chain. The efficacy of relationship management in the client and contractor groups is proven and well documented. However, the industry has a history of slow implementation of relational contracting down the supply chain. Furthermore, there exists little research on relationship management conducted in the supply chain context. This research aims to explore the association between relational contracting structures and processes and supply chain sustainability in the civil engineering construction industry. It endeavours to shed light on the practices and prerequisites for relationship management implementation success and for supply sustainability to develop. The research methodology is a triangulated approach based on Cheung. s (2006) earlier research where questionnaire survey, interviews and case studies were conducted. This new research includes a face-to-face questionnaire survey that was carried out with 100 professionals from 27 contracting organisations in Queensland from June 2008 to January 2009. A follow-up survey sub-questionnaire, further examining project participants. perspectives was sent to another group of professionals (as identified in the main questionnaire survey). Statistical analysis including multiple regression, correlation, principal component factor analysis and analysis of variance were used to identify the underlying dimensions and test the relationships among variables. Interviews and case studies were conducted to assist in providing a deeper understanding as well as explaining findings of the quantitative study. The qualitative approaches also gave the opportunity to critique and validate the research findings. This research presents the implementation of relationship management from the contractor. s perspective. Findings show that the adaption of relational contracting approach in the supply chain is found to be limited; contractors still prefer to keep the suppliers and subcontractors at <b>arm.</b> <b>s</b> <b>length.</b> This research shows that the degree of match and mismatch between organisational structuring and organisational process has an impact on staff. s commitment level and performance effectiveness.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{subjective}} straight-ahead {{direction is}} a very basic perceptual reference for spatial orientation and locomotion. The perceived straight-ahead along the horizontal and vertical meridian is largely determined by both otolith and somatosensory inputs which are altered in microgravity. The Straight Ahead in Microgravity (SAM) experiment will be conducted on the International Space Station (ISS) to examine how this spatial processing changes {{as a function of}} spaceflight. METHODS Data will be collected before the flight, at one-month intervals during long-duration stay (180 days) on board ISS, and after return to Earth. Control studies will also be performed during parabolic flights. Three different protocols will be used in each test session: (1) Fixation: The subject will be asked to look at actual targets (normal vision) and then to imagine these same targets (occluded vision) in the straight-ahead direction. Targets will be located at near distance (<b>arm</b> <b>s</b> <b>length,</b> ~ 0. 5 m), medium distance (~ 1 m), and far distance (beyond 2 m). This task will be successively performed with subject s body aligned with the spacecraft interior, and with subject s body tilted forward and backward by an operator. (2) Saccades: The subject will be asked to make horizontal and vertical saccades, first relative to the spacecraft interior reference system, and then relative to the subject s head reference system. This task will be successively performed with subject s body aligned with the spacecraft interior, and with subject s body tilted in roll or in pitch by an operator. (3) Linear Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR) : The subject will be asked to stare at actual visual targets (normal vision) at various distances (near, medium, far) in the straight-ahead direction. Vision will then be occluded, and the subject will be asked to continue staring at the same imagined targets while he/she is passively translated forward-backward, up-down, or side-to-side. The subject's body motion will be performed by the restrained operator while the subject is free-floating. EXPECTED RESULTS The coupling of downward gaze with vergence eye movements observed on Earth is expected to increase in microgravity. Saccadic eye movements made in darkness along perceived axes are expected to be more closely aligned with the body s longitudinal axis in 0 g compared to 1 g, as the reference system for spatial orientation moves from an allocentric (gravitational) to an egocentric (idiotropic) vector. Changes in the linear VOR will reflect adaptive changes in otolith-ocular reflex contributions to the perceived straight-ahead. DISCUSSION A change in an individual's egocentric reference might have negative consequences on evaluating the direction of an approaching object or on the accuracy of reaching movements or locomotion. Consequently, investigating how microgravity affects the egocenter is important for understanding the problems associated with long-term effects of microgravity on astronauts' and how they re-adapt to the return of gravitational forces on Earth or other planetary surfaces.

40|$|Whenever goods cross {{national}} borders within the channels of a multina-tional corporation (MNC), a transfer price must be calculated for tax purposes. When corporate tax rates differ {{on the two}} sides of the border, the MNC has an incentive to set its transfer prices in a way that reduces its tax burden by reporting higher profits in the country where corporate profits are taxed more lightly. The ability of MNCs to set transfer prices to minimize taxes, however, is circumscribed by the tax regulations of the home and host countries. In the United States, Section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code requires that transfer prices for imports and exports of goods and services be set equal to “arm’s <b>length</b> <b>prices.</b> ” Defining arm’s <b>length</b> <b>prices</b> is often nontrivial.

40|$|Under {{decentralized}} decision-making (DDM), {{how does}} the multinational corporation (MNC) adjust the transfer price when international (effective) corporate tax rates change, ceteris paribus? ^ First, Eric Bond 2 ̆ 7 s (1980) decentralized model of transfer pricing is extended by completing the comparative static analysis. The results are more general than Bond (1980), confirm that the MNC uses the transfer price as a profit-shifting mechanism to minimize its global tax liability to maximize its global after-tax profit, and show that an interior solution for the transfer price is possible. An interior solution implies that tax authorities may be less concerned with transfer pricing “abuses” than the centralized Thomas Horst (1971) model predicts. Also, underlying explanations are developed to support the assumptions of DDM, top management maximizing the MNC 2 ̆ 7 s global after-tax profit, and DGMs (division general managements) maximizing division after-tax profit. ^ Second, although agency costs are implicit in the basic model, an agency cost channel is explicitly built into the model to further address the criticism that the neoclassical firm is a “black box. ” That channel is: A perceived unfair transfer price by the parent DGM, reduced managerial incentives, lower parent DGM effort, a lower quality intra-firm good, lower subsidiary productivity, higher subsidiary costs, lower subsidiary profit, and lower MNC after-tax profit. The comparative static results incorporate {{the effect of a}} perceived unfair transfer price, which is another important factor in addition to tax rates that determines the MNC 2 ̆ 7 s transfer price. The MNC 2 ̆ 7 s ability to use the transfer price to shift profit and avoid taxes is further limited when agency costs are considered. ^ Third, under negotiated transfer pricing, profit-maximizing DGMs cooperate and choose the upper or lower arm 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>length</b> transfer <b>price</b> and the centralized output. Under zero negotiation costs, negotiated transfer pricing dominates centralized transfer pricing, due to the cumulative effect of greater than or equal MNC global after-tax profit and lower agency costs than centralized transfer pricing. After the negotiated transfer price is chosen, profit-maximizing DGMs use a bookkeeping entry, instead of the transfer price, to allocate the joint gain from cooperation, where the share of the gain depends on DGMs 2 ̆ 7 relative bargaining strength. ...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyse the methods used by multinational enterprises in the context of business restructurings to shift profits from high to low tax jurisdictions. Transactions between associated entities have generally been manipulated by applying non-arm’s <b>length</b> <b>prices</b> to these transactions, as well as devising agreements where the economic substance varies from the form of the transaction. The study aims to investigate some of the practical challenges faced by tax administrators in the application of the arm’s length principle. The study was conducted based on a literature review, as well as analysing specific examples reported in newspapers where multinational enterprises have used aggressive tax planning schemes to shift profits. International case law was also analysed to evaluate some of the factors considered by the courts in the determination of the arm’s <b>length</b> <b>price.</b> It was found that multinational enterprises definitely use aggressive tax planning schemes to shift profits. The practical challenges in the determination of arm’s <b>length</b> <b>prices,</b> complexity of the transactions involved, as well as a lack of resources, especially in the developing nations, are some of the factors that cause tax administrators to battle to find a solution to deter and detect these schemes. Other methods such as the unitary taxation method and the country by country reporting concept have been brought forward as alternatives to the arm’s length principle. These alternatives have been proposed in an effort to find a solution to the challenges posed by the arm’s length principle.

40|$|In recent {{articles}} in the Yale Law Journal and the Stanford Law Review, Professor Lynn M. LoPucki has sparked much academic discussion arguing that recent developments in corporate law have led to an erosion in the system of corporate liability, such that it might one day prove impotent. LoPucki has argued that transactions such as asset securitizations, sale-leasebacks, and corporate structures in which liabilities are placed in asset-poor subsidiaries are driving this change. One early critic to the LoPucki thesis, Professor James J. White, has argued that empirical data show no evidence of increasing use of judgement proofing techniques. In this Article, Professor Steven L. Schwarcz joins this debate, arguing that an economic analysis of these transactions suggests that widespread use of these judgement proofing techniques is unlikely. A key distinction in the analysis, Schwarcz argues, is between arm 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>length</b> and non-arm 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>length</b> transactions. <b>Arm</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>length</b> transactions are unlikely to lead to judgement proofing because corporations will receive value [...] often cash [...] for the assets they sell.

40|$|Gray markets {{arise when}} a manufacturer's {{products}} are sold outside of its authorized channels, for instance when goods designated {{for a foreign}} market are resold domestically. One method multinationals use to combat gray markets is to increase internal transfer prices to foreign subsidiaries {{in order to increase}} the gray market's cost base. We illustrate that, when a gray market competitor is present, the optimal price for internal transfers not only exceeds marginal cost, but is also a function of the competitiveness of the upstream economy. Moreover, the presence of a gray market competitor may cause unintended social welfare consequences when domestic governments mandate the use of arm's <b>length</b> transfer <b>prices</b> between international subsidiaries. When markets are sealed, arm's <b>length</b> transfer <b>pricing</b> strictly increases domestic social welfare. In contrast, we demonstrate that when a gray market competitor is present, mandating the use of arm's <b>length</b> transfer <b>pricing</b> decreases domestic social welfare when the domestic market is sufficiently large relative to the foreign market.

It investigates whether the firm’s optimal transfer price {{coincides with the}} arm’s <b>length</b> <b>price</b> and examines how the firm might respond if it is compelled to follow the arm’s length principle. The main findings are: (1) {{in the absence of}} tax transfer incentives, the firm’s optimal transfer price does not coincide with the arm’s <b>length</b> <b>price.</b> If the firm is compelled to follow the arm’s length principle, it has an incentive to circumvent the arm’s length principle by keeping two sets of books, one for internal management, and another for tax reporting purposes; (2) the arm’s length principle can affect the MNF’s decision on whether or not to foreclose its competitor. Absent profit shifting incentives, the firm will foreclose its downstream competitor. Imposing the arm’s length principle induces the firm to supply its competitor, but the firm can revert to its foreclosure decision by keeping two sets of books. If the firm’s upstream and downstream divisions face different tax rates, the firm’s foreclosure decision will be reversed if the arm’s length principle is enforced.

By interpreting the rigid element length as the internal characteristic length, the Eringen 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>length</b> scale coefficient e 0 may be determined by comparing the buckling load from the microstructured beam-grid model and the nonlocal rectangular plate model. The small length scale coefficient is shown to be dependent on the buckling mode, the aspect ratio of plate and boundary conditions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWorldwide {{there are}} a lot of controversies and debates between the tax {{authorities}} and the MNC's about the related party transaction pricing. The tax authorities contest on the grounds that non arm's <b>length</b> <b>price</b> is depriving them of rightful revenue and that the MNC's are doing this to save on tax liability. This is not the case always. It is one of the considerations in the related party transfer pricing. The study tries to find the objectives behind the pricing strategy by the MNC's. Through extensive literature survey the study finds that the tax liability management is not the only objective that the MNC's have while pricing the related party transactions but there are other objectives that have priority in the global strategy of the MNC's which also play a vital role in pricing strategy. The global objectives demand movement of funds from one location to other for various purposes for which non arm's <b>length</b> <b>pricing</b> is used. The study finds that non tax outlook in transfer pricing is very strong and in some cases compelling to affect the transfer pricing strategy. The study finds various purposes other than tax liability management which the MNC's have to attend to while deciding their related party pricing strategy...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of Staphylococcus and Micrococcus species and associated coryneform bacteria, Acinetobacter, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Bacillus, and Streptomyces on skin was determined during October 1971 from samples collected on persons living in North Carolina and New Jersey. Persistence of these organisms on skin was estimated in temporal studies {{conducted during the}} period from June 1971 to June 1972 on persons living in North Carolina. Staphylococci and coryneforms were the most predominant and persistent bacteria isolated from the nares and axillae. Staphylococci, coryneforms, micrococci, and Bacillus were the most predominant and persistent bacteria isolated from the head, legs, and arms. Acinetobacters were most frequently isolated during the warmer months of the years. Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis were the most predominant and persistent staphylococci isolated from the nares, whereas S. epidermidis and S. hominis were the most predominant and persistent staphylococci isolated from the axillae, head, legs, and <b>arms.</b> <b>S.</b> capitis was often isolated from the head and <b>arms</b> and <b>S.</b> haemolyticus was often isolated from the head, legs, and <b>arms.</b> <b>S.</b> simulans, S. xylosus, S. cohnii, S. saprophyticus, S. warneri, and an unclassified coagulase-positive species were only occasionally isolated from skin. Micrococcus luteus was the most predominant and persistent Micrococcus isolated from skin and preferred regions of the head, legs, and arms. M. varians was the second most frequent Micrococcus isolated. M. lylae, M. sedentarius, M. roseus, M. kristinae, and M. nishinomiyaensis were only occasionally isolated from skin. M. lylae was most frequently isolated during the colder months of the years...|$|R
