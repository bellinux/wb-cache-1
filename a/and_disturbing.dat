5|$|After World War I, {{the rivalry}} calmed, and Gothenburg {{supporters}} {{became known as}} friendly and sportsmanlike fans. However, this only applied to the behaviour on home ground, as IFK supporters continued to behave badly when travelling to away matches by train (called Göteborgstågen, the Gothenburg trains), a phenomenon that grew quickly in the 1920s. This behaviour peaked in 1939, just after the outbreak of World War II, when approximately 1,900 IFK fans travelled to Borås to see IFK play Elfsborg. After a 2–3 loss, the fans fought with the Borås police, before returning home to Gothenburg <b>and</b> <b>disturbing</b> a wartime blackout exercise.|$|E
5|$|Escape from Tomorrow is a 2013 American {{independent}} dark fantasy psychological horror film, {{the debut}} of writer and director Randy Moore. It {{tells the story of}} an unemployed father having increasingly bizarre experiences <b>and</b> <b>disturbing</b> visions {{on the last day of}} a family vacation at the Walt Disney World Resort. It premiered in January at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival and was later a personal selection of Roger Ebert, shown at his 15th annual film festival in Champaign, Illinois.

5|$|While many documentaries {{maintain}} an emotional distance from their subjects, Meerkat Manor – {{due to its}} extended length, soap opera-like narration, romanticization of the animals' lives, and close-up filming techniques, provides a closer, more personal view of the meerkats. Viewers describe being emotionally involved in the animals' lives, sometimes forgetting they are watching a documentary. The meerkats' frequently short lives and brutal deaths become surprising <b>and</b> <b>disturbing</b> to some audiences. This experimental format was seen as expanding the boundaries of both the nature documentary genre {{and the nature of}} reality TV.|$|E
5|$|Pigs {{and goats}} were {{released}} {{on the island}} as potential food in the early 1800s, the goats destroying shrubs and grasses used as nesting sites and the pigs eating eggs and chicks <b>and</b> <b>disturbing</b> the land by nuzzling for food. Several birds have become extinct on the island since the arrival of humans. The first round of extinctions included the Lord Howe swamphen or white gallinule, white-throated pigeon, red-crowned parakeet and the Tasman booby, which were eliminated by visitors and settlers {{during the nineteenth century}} either from overhunting for food or protection of crops. Black rats were released from provisioning whaling ships in the 1840s and mice from Norfolk Island in 1860. In 1918 the black rat was accidentally introduced with the shipwreck of the SS Makambo which ran aground at Ned's Beach. This triggered a second wave of extinctions, including the vinous-tinted thrush, robust white-eye, Lord Howe starling, Lord Howe fantail and the Lord Howe gerygone as well as the destruction of the native phasmid and decimation of palm fruits. Bounties were offered for rat and pig tails and 'ratting' became a popular pursuit. Subsequent poisoning programs have kept populations low. The Lord Howe boobook may have become extinct through predation by, or competition with, the Tasmanian masked owls which were introduced in the 1920s in a failed attempt to control the rat population. Stray dogs are also a threat as they could harm the native wood hen and other birds.|$|E
