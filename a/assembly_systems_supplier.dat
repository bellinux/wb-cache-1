As the uncertainty of the supply chain is increasing, coordinating the <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> effectively under supply disruption becomes a critical success factor for a global supply chain system. In this study, we consider an <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> with two <b>suppliers</b> and one manufacturer and formulate the model of each partner with bonus policy under supply disruption. The optimal decision of each partner is analyzed under decentralized decision. Then we optimize the total cost of <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> under centralized decision which is regarded as the benchmark.

We first develop two different scenarios to {{examine the impact of}} Supply-Hub. One is that suppliers and manufacturers make their decisions separately, and the other is that the Supply-Hub makes joint decisions with collaborative scheduling. The results show that our scheduling model with the Supply-Hub is a NP-complete problem, therefore, we propose an auto-adapted differential evolution algorithm to solve this problem. Moreover, we illustrate that the performance of collaborative scheduling by the Supply-Hub is superior to separate decision made by each manufacturer and supplier. Furthermore, we also show that the algorithm proposed has good convergence and reliability, which can be applicable to more complicated supply chain environment...|$|R

40|$|Flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> {{have emerged}} in {{response}} to changing markets and increased variety in form of demands of new products and manufacturer’s need for differentiation. <b>Assembly</b> <b>systems</b> {{play a critical role}} in handling great variety and adapting to dynamic changes at the same time as securing product quality and productivity. Therefore, <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> should be designed to be able to handle changes. However, the design of flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> is a challenge because it involves several subjects such as the configuration of the flow, the material handling and the flexibility to handle future changes and adjustment. In addition, time-to-market and time-to-volume are important which means that faster <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> designs are required. The design process of <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> concerns the procedures that guide the design work to achieve an <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> proposal. The design process is divided into a number of stages/phases describing the activities that should be done and when they should be performed as well as the expected result after each phase supporting the decision-making process. Research argues that working in a systematic and structured way is important in order to achieve better <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> in shorter time. However, even though there is extensive research work in regard to flexibility, knowledge is limited concerning the design process of <b>assembly</b> <b>systems.</b> Therefore, the objective of this thesis has been to increase the knowledge about the design of flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> by investigating the relation between the <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> design process and flexibility. The characteristics of flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> and how flexibility is considered during the design process have also been studied in this thesis. Literature reviews were conducted as well as three case studies and one exploratory survey in the manufacturing industry of heavy vehicles. Study I concerns the results of having studied an industrial international project of the design process of a flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> during two years. In study II, flexibility needs, enablers and challenges in <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> were identified. In study III, the mechanism used to achieve flexibility in the <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> of two companies were investigated. The exploratory survey study IV, was a pilot study to investigate the relationship between the design process of <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> and flexibility based on the association of different variables involved in the design process of flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>systems.</b> From the holistic perspective adopted in this thesis, the results showed that flexibility should be considered in a comprehensive way during all the design process. The design process of flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> is iterative, circumscribed by different conditions, and requires support as well as the participation of different roles and functions to achieve a solution. The increased knowledge generated in the research is expected to lead to future development of working procedures that better can support the design process of flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{customer}} {{demands for}} product variety {{in conjunction with}} the short lifecycle of products has caused manufacturing companies to introduce a wide range of products by accommodating flexibility. An <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> {{is an essential part of}} the manufacturing system from both cost and time perspectives. Hence, the shift towards flexibility in manufacturing companies highlights the significance of establishing flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> and designing products that are closely aligned with them. Despite its significance, however, the flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> concept and its requirements for product design have not been clearly defined in research and from a practical point of view. Most research on flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> has mainly approached either the design or the balancing and scheduling issues of these systems, whereas only a few studies have briefly defined the flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> they focused on, without further specifying the characteristics of a flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> and its requirements for product design. Taking that into account, the objective of this work is to provide a framework to contribute to the understanding of the concept of flexibility in an <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> and its requirements for product design. In order to fulfil the objective, four empirical studies combined with literature reviews have been conducted. The empirical studies, a multiple case study and three single case studies, investigate the definition of flexibility in an <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> as well as the requirements that a flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> imposes on product design. Through its findings, this research provides a definition of flexibility in <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> that mainly revolves around volume, mix and new product flexibility. In addition, six constituents of a flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> have been identified: adaptable material supply, versatile workforce, increased commonality, standardised work content, integrated product properties and strategic planning. Furthermore, three requirements of a flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> for product design are defined, which, if fulfilled, reduce the complexity created by product variety and consequently support flexibility in the <b>assembly</b> <b>system.</b> Accordingly, to increase the understanding of the concept of flexibility in an <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> and its requirements for product design, a four-staged framework is suggested. The proposed framework deals with the activities related to the concept and the development of a flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> and is expected to be received by assembly practitioners as a link between assembly and product design teams in the product realisation process.

40|$|Growing {{customer}} {{demands for}} product variety, new and rapid technological developments, {{and the short}} life cycle of products characterise the current volatile market. To maintain a competitive edge in the market, manufacturing companies need to accommodate flexibility in their <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> that are essential parts of the manufacturing systems with respect to cost, time, and creating product variety. Given the importance of establishing flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>systems,</b> the complexity raised by increasing product variety {{and the value of}} appropriate product designs to <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> highlight the pivotal role of product design in a flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>system.</b> Despite its significance to theory and practice, however, the characteristics of flexibility in an <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> and its links to product design are still ambiguous and unexplored. The objective of this thesis is to expand the current knowledge of flexibility in <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> and using product design to support its achievement. To accomplish the objective and by adopting an interactive research approach, five case studies were conducted in the heavy machinery manufacturing industry. A literature review underpins all the case studies comprising one multiple and four single case studies. Through its findings, this research defines flexibility in an <b>assembly</b> <b>system,</b> identifies its dimensions, and pinpoints its enablers. Additionally, three requirements of a flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> for product design are identified: a common assembly sequence, similar assembly interfaces, and common parts. These requirements, if fulfilled in product design across distinct product families, reduce the perceived complexity and support various flexibility dimensions in the <b>assembly</b> <b>system.</b> Moreover, the development of a common assembly sequence and similar assembly interfaces, as the two key requirements of a flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> for product design, is described. Further, based upon developing understanding and knowledge about a flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> and its requirements for product design, a model and a framework are proposed. The model addresses the role of product design in achieving flexibility in an <b>assembly</b> <b>system.</b> To support the alignment of product design with the key requirements of a flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> during the product design process, the assembly-oriented framework details the development of these requirements. Through its outcomes, this thesis contributes to the research area of flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> and sheds light on its interface with the engineering design field. Moreover, the proposed model and framework aim to assist assembly practitioners and product designers in establishing a flexible <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> and aligning product design with its key requirements...|$|R
40|$|The {{ultimate}} aim when designing an <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> {{is to make}} it strategically and operationally competitive. Competitive {{systems for}} manufacturing, especially <b>assembly</b> <b>systems,</b> have to cope with frequent changes of demands. The aim to have a short response time to customer demand, e. i. mass customization, requires <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> that are reliable, have high availability and have ability to produce the right product correctly. This means a combination of short resetting time and ability to vary the systems output of products. A major challenge is to minimize the lead-time that directly has influence on order-to-delivery time, while maintaining product flexibility and robustness to absorb late market changes. Given that the <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> is working the way it is supposed to do, the order-to-delivery time is directly dependant on the setup time and the operation time. The problem is that automated <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> have a low availability due to that technical equipment does not work, caused by lack of knowledge, breakdowns, limited ability to perform the operation etc. This often leeds to that when a company needs variant flexibility they keep the <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> tasks manual. Totally manual <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> is not the future for competitiveness. Therefore we need to develop <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> that are available and have product flexibility to absorb late market changes, and still have a short order-to delivery time.

It focuses on the assembly work involved in the completion of truck chassis carried out by blue‐collar employees. Extensive (physical) alterations during this period have been important for understanding the plants' present design. The various designs of the <b>assembly</b> <b>system,</b> in combination with alterations and changes, have radically reformed the blue‐collar employee's work in a way that, in most respects, had not been intended. The ambitious guidelines, design assumptions and praxis of the early plant design which promoted collective dimensions of work have shifted to ones in which assembly work can be seen more as a set of individualised tasks. Moreover, the plant, which in earlier times had been small‐scale and utilised a heterogeneous <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> design, now has been transformed into a large‐scale plant with a homogenous <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> design. That is, to be more specific, two rather short assembly lines with intermediate buffers (1980 s <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> design) were turned into the use of extended assembly lines without intermediate buffers (1990 s <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> designs). The latter <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> were earlier working in coexistence with so‐called assembly docks (small work groups completed their own truck chassis).

However, {{there is a lack of}} systematic methods for the joint design of product families and RMSs. Co-evolution of product families and <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> is introduced as a new method for the joint design and reconfiguration of product families and <b>assembly</b> <b>systems</b> within and across product generations. There are two main phases in the co-evolution methodology. The first phase involves the joint design of a product family and <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> in the first generation. The second phase involves the joint evolution of the product family and <b>assembly</b> <b>system</b> between product generations. For co-evolution, models are required for: (i) the joint design of a product family and its corresponding <b>assembly</b> <b>system,</b> (ii) the evolution of the product family within the constraints of an assisting <b>assembly</b> <b>system,</b> and (iii) the reconfiguration of the <b>assembly</b> <b>system.</b> Methodologies are introduced for the first and third problems in this dissertation.

This paper proposes a new paradigm of Symbiotic <b>Assembly</b> <b>Systems</b> (SAS) in order to integrate the human aspects into these developments. The motivation is human actors should be treated as an intrinsic component of <b>assembly</b> <b>systems.</b> This would result in a system that can take advantage of its component's individual strengths (human or machines), and create a symbiotic environment. Beyond machine automation, human interventions in the system need not only to be modelled as processes but also integrated into the whole system operation. The idea builds on biological systems and their ability to establish symbiotic environments resulting in optimal collaborations. This paper proposes the conceptual vision of Symbiotic <b>Assembly</b> <b>Systems</b> and identifies the necessary developments required to achieve such paradigm. Furthermore it reports on how the developments from other paradigms can be integrated into SAS. An illustrative example is presented to demonstrate the potential of this approach...|$|R
