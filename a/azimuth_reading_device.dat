40|$|We {{describe}} {{a prototype of}} the AirBook, an assistive <b>reading</b> <b>device</b> that combines dynamic text (especially RSVP, that is, rapid serial visual presentation) with forcefree capacitive field sensors to create a simple, easily controlled assistive <b>reading</b> <b>device.</b> This reader is designed to assist people with visual disabilities (like dyslexia, loss of fine motor control or loss of contrast sensitivity) by giving them more control over font size and contrast. It’s also for people with upper-body disabilities, lack of fine muscle control, or severe arthritis, {{all of which can}} make the reading of standard paper books difficult. The force-free sensor system can be adjusted for large-scale motion or for tiny ranges of movement, and requires no pressure or fiddling with physical objects. The sensors read the proximity of a human limb, and adjust parameters on the text accordingly. For example, the <b>reading</b> <b>device</b> can be controlled with the motion of one finger if necessary, or adjusted to read the motion of an entire arm or leg...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{successful}} E-book market needs {{several members}} {{to work together}} including authors, publishers, online book stores, book distributors, <b>reading</b> <b>device</b> manufactures and so on. Although various participants have actively involved in Taiwan digital publishing, the sales of E-book is still less than 1 % of total publishers’ revenues in 2011. Compared with North America market share, Taiwan's E-book market share is not meaningful. As a matter of fact, Taiwan readers are facing a dilemma {{in which there is}} a lack of E-book title and no proper <b>reading</b> <b>device</b> available. This study examines the current status of Taiwan E-book market from the E-book supply chain members’ points of view. We adopted an exploratory approach to provide different perspectives of these members through semi-structured interviews.

40|$|E-book <b>reading</b> <b>devices</b> {{open new}} {{possibilities}} {{in the field}} of reading. More activities than just reading a book can be performed with a single electronic device. For a long time, electronic <b>reading</b> <b>devices</b> have not been favored because their active LCD displays used to have a relatively low contrast. The new generation of electronic <b>reading</b> <b>devices</b> differs from earlier ones {{in the nature of the}} display: active LCD displays have been replaced with displays based on e-ink technology, which has display properties closer to that of printed paper. Moreover, e-ink technology has higher power efficiency, thereby increasing battery life and reducing weight. At first sight, the display looks similar to paper print, but the question remains whether the reading behavior also is equal to that of reading a printed book. In the present study, we analyzed and compared reading behavior on e-reader displays and on printed paper. The results suggest that the reading behavior on e-readers is indeed very similar to the reading behavior on print. Participants shared similar proportions of regressive saccades while reading on e-readers and print. Significant differences in fixation duration suggest that e-readers, in some situations, may even provide better legibility...|$|R

There-fore, this paper investigates the relationship between readability and <b>reading</b> <b>devices</b> such as a smart phone, a tablet, and paper. We sug-gest readability factors that are strongly related with the readability of a specific device by showing the correlations between various fac-tors in each device and human-rated readabil-ity. Our experimental results show that each device has its own readability characteristics, and thus different weights should be imposed on readability factors according to the device type. In order to prove the usefulness of the results, we apply the device-dependent read-ability to news article recommendation. ...|$|R
