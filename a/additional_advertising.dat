5|$|Highbury {{could hold}} more than 60,000 spectators at its peak, {{and had a}} {{capacity}} of 57,000 until the early 1990s. The Taylor Report and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an all-seater stadium {{in time for the}} 1993–94 season, thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators. This capacity had to be reduced further during Champions League matches to accommodate <b>additional</b> <b>advertising</b> boards, so much so that for two seasons, from 1998 to 2000, Arsenal played Champions League home matches at Wembley, which could house more than 70,000 spectators.|$|E
5|$|Greer Stadium's {{original}} scoreboard was a black, non-descript, rectangular {{unit with}} a two line reader panel. In 1985, it {{was moved to}} beside the left field foul pole {{to make room for}} a new rectangular 4-line scoreboard 10 feet (3m) high with a fully animated reader panel. The original unit was then used as an out-of-town scoreboard, displaying the scores of other baseball games. When the guitar display was installed in 1993, the original scoreboard was removed and replaced by the second scoreboard, which became the new out-of-town board. From 2008 to 2014, the out-of-town scoreboard was not used to display scores; instead it was used only as a support for <b>additional</b> <b>advertising</b> signage.|$|E
5|$|In 1954 Hamling {{started a}} {{companion}} magazine, Imaginative Tales; in addition, his company Greenleaf Publishing was {{the publisher of}} Rogue, a men's magazine modelled after Playboy. In 1957 the liquidation of American News Company, a major distributor, meant that many magazines had to scramble to find new distributors. Independent distributors often required that the magazines be monthly, and that they be in a larger format than the digest-size common in science fiction magazines. The larger format required higher revenue to be profitable, {{but in many cases}} it proved impossible to attract the <b>additional</b> <b>advertising</b> income that would have kept the magazines afloat. By the end of 1958, many titles had disappeared as a result, with Imagination one of the victims; Hamling closed down both Imagination and its sister magazine to invest the money in Rogue instead. The last issue of Imagination was October 1958, the 63rd issue, while Imaginative Tales, retitled Space Travel, ceased with the November 1958 issue. There was no indication in either magazine that the end had come, though the last issue of Imagination omitted its letter, book review and pen-pal columns, all of which had appeared regularly in prior issues.|$|E

50|$|Advertising first {{appeared}} on run-throughs in the late 1970s. Costs increased commensurate {{with the size of}} the run-through, creating a need for <b>additional</b> funding.

If different from the club colors, this detracts from the visual effect of the banner. Inspirational, or anti-opposition, messages were replaced by advertising slogans, creating an insipid feel to the banner.|$|R

40|$|Purpose - Assess {{whether a}} new type of TV {{advertising}} format, telescopic advertising, results in increased advertising effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach - Reports on how personal video recorders (PVRs) are generally regarded as being detrimental to consumer exposure to advertisements. Suggests that PVRs may result in new models of advertising, including 'telescopic' advertising that allows consumers to access <b>additional</b> audio-visual <b>advertising</b> content on demand. Features a study conducted in Australia examining the potential effectiveness of telescopic advertising by comparing it with two traditional advertising formats (the 30 -second commercial and the long-format commercial). Drawing on a relevant literature review to present a number of hypotheses that were tested on 154 students at an Australian university. Findings - Puts forward how the telescopic advertising was found to be more effective than both forms of traditional advertising; outlines how it was more effective with regard to attitude towards the advertisement, brand and the behavioural intentions of consumers toward the brand. Measure whether novelty effected the findings; student sample. Originality/value - Provides evidence that telescopic advertising makes consumers more likely to buy the advertised product...|$|R
