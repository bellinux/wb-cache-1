5|$|Bowie shelved his solo {{career in}} 1989, {{retreating}} {{to the relative}} <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> band membership {{for the first time}} since the early 1970s. A hard-rocking quartet, Tin Machine came into being after Bowie began to work experimentally with guitarist Reeves Gabrels. The line-up was completed by Tony and Hunt Sales, whom Bowie had known since the late 1970s for their contribution, on bass and drums respectively, to Iggy Pop's 1977 album Lust For Life.|$|E
5|$|For some, {{being a part}} of a {{community}} is an important resource because they often report having felt ostracized. Although online communities exist, affiliation with online communities vary. Some question the concept of online community, while others depend on the online asexual community heavily for support. Elizabeth Abbott posits that there has always been an asexual element in the population, but that asexual people kept a low profile. While the failure to consummate marriage was seen as an insult to the sacrament of marriage in medieval Europe, and has sometimes been used as grounds for divorce or to rule a marriage void, asexuality, unlike homosexuality, has never been illegal, and it has usually gone unnoticed. However, in the 21st century, the <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> online communication and general popularity of social networking online has facilitated the formation of {{a community}} built around a common asexual identity.|$|E
5|$|Song scholar-officials {{were granted}} ranks, honors, and career {{appointments}} {{on the basis}} of merit, the standards of which were codified and more objective than those in the Tang dynasty. The <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> exam candidates guarded against fraud and favoritism by those who could judge papers based upon handwriting and/or signature calligraphy; a bureau of copyists was tasked with the job of recopying all the candidates' papers before grading. After passing the prefectural, provincial, and then palace exam (the most prestigious), scholarly degrees did not immediately ensure an appointment to office, but the more prestigious the degree, the more certain one's career in higher administrative posts would be. The central government held the exclusive right to appoint or remove officials. The case for removal was always carefully examined, since the central government kept a recorded dossier of reports on each official, stored in the capital for later review.|$|E
40|$|Anonymity is an {{important}} issue in information security, which its main goal is to protect entities privacy in the systems. Different methods and protocols (with different types <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> services) have been developed so far to provide special <b>anonymity</b> requirements <b>of</b> applications. Each of these systems has been developed with different ad hoc approaches. In this paper we present a conceptual framework that makes specification, analysis and design <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> applications more systematic. To do this, first we go toward presenting a conceptual model <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> which can be used in clear description of different aspects <b>of</b> <b>anonymity.</b> Then we extract a list <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> primitives from the existing anonymity providing methods. These primitives are base functions which can be composed to form anonymity services to provide specified <b>anonymity</b> requirements <b>of</b> the system...|$|R

We give several definitions <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> with respect to agents, actions, and observers in multiagent systems, and we relate our definitions <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> to other definitions of information hiding, such as secrecy. We also give probabilistic definitions <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> that are able to quantify an observer's uncertainty about the state of the system. Finally, we relate our definitions <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> to other formalizations <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> and information hiding, including definitions <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> in the process algebra CSP and definitions of information hiding using function views...|$|R
5|$|The book {{consists}} of twelve chapters, plus an Epilogue and an Acknowledgements section at the end. Smith and MacKinnon individually write alternating chapters, {{each of which}} covers one month from March 2005 to February 2006. In the first chapter MacKinnon tells how his idea for the 100-mile diet began and Smith agrees to try it for one year. They begin symbolically {{on the first day}} of Spring, March 21, and define 'local' as 100 miles, a convenient radius that would include the Lower Mainland, the southern half of Vancouver Island, and Whatcom County and Skagit County in Washington State. Their exceptions to this rule include meals eaten while traveling, meals prepared by friends, and business lunches. Their initial month was expensive as they scoured grocery stores for whatever they could find. In the second chapter, Smith describes her and MacKinnon as an unwed urban couple in their early thirties with no children and living in a rented apartment. They recount how eating impacted their relationship before and after the diet, the <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> prepackaged foods, the traceability of their diet, and the diets of the Coast Salish.|$|E
5|$|Wendell and Edith Willkie {{moved to}} New York in October 1929, only {{weeks before the}} Wall Street Crash of 1929, and found an {{apartment}} overlooking Central Park. Initially intimidated by the size and <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> the big city, Wendell Willkie soon learned to love it. He attended the Broadway theatre, and read through ten newspapers each day. Willkie {{and his wife had}} little in common, and grew apart through the 1930s. He acquired a social life, and met Irita Van Doren, the book review editor of the New York Herald Tribune who became a friend, and later his lover. Cultured, brilliant and well connected, Van Doren introduced him to new books, new ideas, and new circles of friends. Unlike Van Doren, Willkie was indiscreet about their relationship, and their affair was well known to the reporters covering him during his 1940 presidential campaign. None of them printed a word.|$|E

40|$|The basic {{requirements}} for secure communication in a vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) are anonymous authentication with source non-repudiation and integrity. The existing security protocols in VANETs do not {{differentiate between the}} <b>anonymity</b> requirements <b>of</b> different vehicles and the level <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> provided by these protocols {{is the same for}} all the vehicles in a network. To provide high level <b>of</b> <b>anonymity,</b> the resource requirements of security protocol would also be high. Hence, in a resource constrained VANET, it is necessary to differentiate between the <b>anonymity</b> requirements <b>of</b> different vehicles and to provide the level <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> to a vehicle as per its requirement. In this paper, we have proposed a novel protocol for authentication which can provide multiple levels <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> in VANETs. The protocol makes use of identity based signature mechanism and pseudonyms to implement anonymous authentication with source non-repudiation and integrity. By controlling the number of pseudonyms issued to a vehicle and the lifetime of each pseudonym for a vehicle, the protocol is able to control the level <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> provided to a vehicle. In addition, the protocol includes a novel pseudonym issuance policy using which the protocol can ensure the uniqueness of a newly generated pseudonym by checking only a very small subset of the set of pseudonyms previously issued to all the vehicles. The protocol cryptographically binds an expiry date to each pseudonym, and in this way, enforces an implicit revocation for the pseudonyms. Analytical and simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed protocol...|$|R

These machines, which are in use in 35 municipalities, including Amsterdam, have to be improved or replaced with an alternative before the elections.

25|$|Tor {{can also}} provide {{anonymity}} to websites and other servers. Servers configured to receive inbound connections only through Tor are called hidden services. Rather than revealing a server's IP address (and thus its network location), a hidden service is accessed through its onion address, usually via the Tor Browser. The Tor network understands these addresses by looking up their corresponding public keys and introduction points from a distributed hash table within the network. It can route data to and from hidden services, even those hosted behind firewalls or network address translators (NAT), while preserving the <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> both parties. Tor is necessary to access hidden services.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect that}} this concept had on church music was threefold: first, it bred a highly {{conservative}} attitude to musical composition; secondly, it stabilized the melodic tradition of certain hymns; and thirdly, it continued, for a time, the <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> the composer. For if a chant is of heavenly origin, then the acknowledgment received by man in transmitting it to posterity {{ought to be}} minimal. This is especially true when he deals with hymns that were {{known to have been}} first sung by angelic choirs—such as the Amen, Alleluia, Trisagion, Sanctus and Doxology. Consequently, until Palaeologan times, it was inconceivable for a composer to place his name beside a notated text in the manuscripts.|$|E
40|$|By {{reducing}} inhibition, enhancing participation, and {{by increasing}} the number <b>of</b> ideas generated, <b>anonymity</b> is expected to improve communication and decision making and to enhance group performance. However, empirical evidence is inconclusive and provides a rather confusing understanding of the real effects <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> in group support systems (GSS). This paper addresses the state of empirical findings by examining the impacts <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> on groups through a new conceptualization <b>of</b> <b>anonymity.</b> In particular, this paper draws on the literature in social psychology and argues that anonymity has been too narrowly conceptualized as non-identification of participants, when in fact its most important dimension is subjective and perceptual. Measures of the new concept are presented and preliminary tests are conducted. This paper also argues that {{a better understanding of}} the effects <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> could be achieved by broadening the scope of research to include other situational factors such as attentional and accountability cues. A contingency approach for studying the effects <b>of</b> <b>anonymity</b> is presented. 1...|$|R

This play treats the {{events leading up to}} the start of Shakespeare's play (though the two texts do not have identical characters). This closeness, along with the <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> the manuscript, has led certain scholars to attribute {{all or part of the}} play to Shakespeare, though many critics view this play as a secondary influence on Shakespeare, not as his work.|$|E
25|$|Ghettoisation among Indian Muslims {{began in}} the mid-1970s when first {{communal}} riots occurred. It got heightened after the 1989 Bhagalpur violence in Bihar and became a trend after the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992. Soon several major cities developed ghettos, or segregated areas, where the Muslim population moved in. This trend however, did not help for the anticipated security the <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> ghetto was thought to have provided. During the 2002 Gujarat riots, several such ghettos became easy targets for the rioting mobs, as they enabled the profiling of residential colonies. This kind of ghettoisation {{can be seen in}} Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and many cities of Gujarat where a clear socio-cultural demarcation exists between Hindu-dominated and Muslim-dominated neighbourhoods.|$|E

In combining her photographs with conventional practices, Hahn successfully intertwines formal and conceptual aspects. Not only does she speak to the mundane tasks of everyday life, but also about routine and normativity. In highlighting the ordinary in her work, Hahn elevates and revives that which has been lost in the practice of daily life. Embroidery references femininity, as Hahn underlines the feminist issue of the <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> women's handicraft. Her embroidery often emphasized flowers with its three-dimensionality, furthering the idea of femininity; she later on pursued this as a symbol and incorporated it in several of her other series.|$|E

25|$|The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) {{published}} {{a paper in}} 2005 offering specific policy solutions for alleviating {{the spread of the}} HIV virus in the MSM population for specific regions around the world. They pointed to “a profound lack of knowledge” and stigma about sexual identity as worldwide barriers to preventing transmission and encouraging those infected to seek treatment. The UNAIDS program has recommended that the South African government implement “sex positive” policies to reduce societal stigma around homosexuality and promote the use of water-based lubricants. Particularly in Morocco, the program has advocated distributing condoms in prisons. In recent years, the Chinese government has begun to acknowledge the sexuality of its constituents. According to UNAIDS, the “Government has made significant progress in recognizing the issue of male-to-male sexual health and HIV.” In Latin America, outreach to rural areas is critical to ensuring care to all individuals. The United Nations also emphasizes a focus on LGBT populations that are most vulnerable in Latin American nations. In Jamaica, as in many countries across the globe, homosexuality is outlawed so there are unique challenges to HIV prevention in the MSM community. The UN is trying to implement community-based strategies in Jamaica while still ensuring the <b>anonymity</b> <b>of</b> the people served. In Norway, UNAIDS has observed an increasing number of MSM who have untreated sexually transmitted infections, and their emphasis is on promoting condom use within the gay community. Despite Canada’s “liberal and progressive” reputation on the world stage, HIV-related stigma is still related to the gay community. The United Nations believes the United States needs to recognize sexual education as a fundamental human right. Additionally, better research on MSM in the U.S. would positively affect funding for HIV prevention and treatment programs.|$|E
