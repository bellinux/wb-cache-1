Although other items associated with Tipu, including his sword, {{have recently been}} purchased <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> to India by billionaire Vijay Mallya, Tipu's Tiger has not itself {{been the subject of}} an official repatriation request, presumably due to the ambiguity underlying Tipu's image in the eyes of Indians; his being an object of loathing in the eyes of some Indians while considered a hero by others.|$|E
5|$|During the Interregnum, a governor, Sir John Fowell, was {{appointed}} by Parliament to run the defences of Dartmouth and to prevent smuggling. An order was given in 1650 for Bayard's Cove Fort to be repaired <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> into full service. Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660 and initially granted the Dartmouth defences to the control of town once again. By 1662, however, the fortifications in Dartmouth were garrisoned by a royal force of 23 men and overseen by Sir John, who continued in his post as captain and governor until 1677.|$|E

5|$|Seeking {{national}} reconciliation between revolutionaries and Catholics, the Concordat of 1801 was signed on 15 July 1801 between Napoleon and Pope Pius VII. It solidified the Roman Catholic Church {{as the majority}} church of France <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> most of its civil status. The hostility of devout Catholics against the state had now largely been resolved. It did not restore the vast church lands and endowments that had been seized during the revolution and sold off. As {{a part of the}} Concordat, he presented another set of laws called the Organic Articles.|$|E
5|$|Several {{of these}} {{installations}} were identified from Royal Air Force (RAF) aerial reconnaissance photographs during 1941, but their exact purpose {{and the nature}} of the equipment that they possessed was not known. Some British scientists believed that these stations were connected with the heavy losses being experienced by RAF bombers conducting bombing raids against targets in Occupied Europe. The scientists requested that one of these installations be raided and the technology it possessed be studied and, if possible, extracted <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> to Britain for further examination.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} around Passchendaele {{proved to}} be the division's last offensive actions for 1917 and they spent the winter months in the rear training, or undertaking defensive duties in reasonably quiet sectors of the line as they were reformed <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> up to strength. Around this time also, the five Australian divisions on the Western Front were reorganised into a unified command structure under the Australian Corps.|$|E

5|$|The museum {{displays}} a 2,400-year-old female Egyptian mummy {{on loan from}} the New Brunswick Theological Seminary. The mummy, which dates to 320 or 330 B.C. in the Ptolemaic era, was discovered in Northern Egypt <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> to the United States by a Dutch Reformed missionary who served there in the early 1700s. Little else {{is known about the}} mummy's origins, but it was stored in a closet at the seminary until 1968 when it was first put on display.|$|E
5|$|While in the Bay of Campeche, {{the shrimp}} boat Celestino Arias was sunken by strong waves {{generated}} by Janet after it suffered engine failures. The stranded ship was heavily {{damaged by the}} hurricane's strong winds in the bay, which broke towing lines. All of the ship's crewmen, which had evacuated the boat after it sunk, were later rescued <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> to Tampa, Florida. Along the coast, tides were reported to be 3–4ft (0.91–1.2m) above average. Farther north along the Texas coast, tides were 2ft (0.61m) above average, blocking beach roads near Corpus Christi.|$|E
5|$|Æthelnoth (died 1038) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop of Canterbury. Descended {{from an earlier}} English king, Æthelnoth became a monk prior to {{becoming}} archbishop. While archbishop, he travelled to Rome <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> saint's relics. He consecrated {{a number of other}} bishops who came from outside his archdiocese, leading to some friction with other archbishops. Although he was regarded as a saint after his death, there is little evidence of his veneration or of a cult in Canterbury or elsewhere.|$|E

After SG-1 go missing on their off-world mission, a Goa'uld named Ba'al {{contacts}} Stargate Command and suggests an exchange of the captured SG-1 against Camulus, another Goa'uld who requested asylum on Earth several episodes before. With the help of Camulus, a potent power source is found <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> to Stargate Command, only to find it tainted by Camulus (powering it up could result in the destruction of the Solar system). With the SGC suffering from a temporary electricity failure caused by the alien plants, Ba'al's renewed contacting only results in O'Neill's mocking. Exhausted by sleep deprivation two days to Zero Hour, O'Neill finishes his letter to General Hammond to inform him of his resignation.|$|E
5|$|Caligula's first acts {{were said}} to be generous in spirit, though many were {{political}} in nature. To gain support, he granted bonuses to the military, including the Praetorian Guard, city troops and the army outside Italy. He destroyed Tiberius's treason papers, declared that treason trials were a thing of the past, and recalled those who had been sent into exile. He helped those who had been harmed by the imperial tax system, banished certain sexual deviants, and put on lavish spectacles for the public, including gladiatorial games. Caligula collected <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> the bones of his mother and of his brothers and deposited their remains in the tomb of Augustus.|$|E
5|$|Local labour was {{supplied}} by an Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit (ANGAU) detachment, initially consisting of eight Australian Army officers and eleven native police. A {{week after the}} landing, 199 native labourers were brought in from Lae. Initially, the ANGAU detachment {{found it difficult to}} lure the frightened local people in from the bush, but as the word spread that there was food and safety to be had within the American perimeter, large numbers began to walk in. ANGAU established a native settlement in the Biding River area. By 13 February, 680 native labourers were at work. They constructed camps for the Americans, carried supplies to units in the mountains <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> the wounded, and worked in the hospital. ANGAU also carried out patrols, providing intelligence on the Japanese positions.|$|E

5|$|Major André was {{captured}} near Tarrytown on Saturday, September 23 by three Westchester militiamen named John Paulding, Isaac Van Wart, and David Williams. The papers were found exposing the plot to capture West Point {{and sent to}} Gen. Washington, and Arnold's intentions came to light after Washington examined them. Meanwhile, André convinced the unsuspecting Colonel John Jameson, to whom he was delivered, to send him back to Arnold at West Point. However, Major Benjamin Tallmadge, {{a member of the}} Culper Ring established under Washington's orders, insisted that Jameson order the prisoner to be intercepted <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back.</b> Jameson reluctantly recalled the lieutenant who had been delivering André into Arnold's custody, but then sent the same lieutenant as a messenger to notify Arnold of André's arrest.|$|E
5|$|On 26 January, a {{group of}} rebels {{attacked}} a Catholic mission at Nguludi belonging to Father Swelsen. The mission was defended by four African armed guards, {{one of whom was}} killed, Father Swelsen was also wounded in the fighting and the church was burnt down. The military and militia forces assaulted Mbombwe again the same day but encountered no resistance. Many rebels, including Chilembwe, had fled the village disguised as civilians. Mbombwe's fall and the government troops' subsequent demolition of Chilembwe's church with dynamite ended the rebellion. Kaduya was captured <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> to Magomero where he was publicly executed.|$|E
5|$|South Indian mercenaries {{were often}} {{employed}} in the armies of the Anuradhapura Kingdom during its latter stages. Manavamma and Moggallana I (491–508) obtained {{the assistance of the}} Pallavas during succession disputes to secure the throne. However, the Anuradhapura kingdom appears to have had strong armies during some periods, such as when Sena II sent his armies to South India against the Pandyan king. Gajabahu I also launched an invasion against South India to rescue 12,000 captives, <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> 12,000 prisoners as well as the freed captives. Surprisingly however, a navy was not considered important during the Anuradhapura Kingdom, and one was rarely maintained. This would have been the first line of defence for the island nation and would also have been helpful in dealing with invasions from South India.|$|E

5|$|The 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion was {{initially}} divided up, with each company {{attached to a}} different brigade of the 7th Division. Peeler's D Company—assigned to the 25th Brigade—was originally tasked with the maintenance and general repair of the road network in its locality. However, when the Vichy French launched a counter-attack on 15 June, the battalion was concentrated in the Merdjayoun area {{in an effort to}} prevent any further French gains. On the night of 27 June, after a costly assault against the Vichy French at Merdjayoun earlier that day, Peeler led out a patrol to recover the wounded. Four soldiers were discovered <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> to the Australian lines. Despite suffering heavy casualties in Syria, the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion served throughout the campaign, including participation in the decisive Battle of Damour in July.|$|E
5|$|The English Civil War {{broke out}} in 1642 between the Royalist {{supporters}} of Charles I and the supporters of Parliament. The fortifications in North Wales were held by supporters of the king {{and in some cases}} became strategically important as part of the communications route between royal forces operating in England and supplies and reinforcements in Ireland. The castles and towns' defences were repaired at considerable expense <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> into service, garrisoned by local Royalists. Parliament gained the upper hand in England, however, and by 1646 its armies were able to intervene in North Wales. Caernarfon, Beaumaris and Conwy were taken that year. Harlech – the last fortress to hold out for the king – surrendered in March 1647, marking {{the end of the first}} phase of the civil war.|$|E
5|$|The battalion's {{losses in}} Greece and Crete were heavy, totaling 30 dead, 54 wounded and 353 captured. As a result, the 2/6th {{had to be}} re-formed in Palestine <b>and</b> <b>brought</b> <b>back</b> up to {{strength}} with reinforcements before it was dispatched Syria in December 1941, to join the Allied garrison that had been established there as occupation force {{at the conclusion of}} the Syria–Lebanon campaign against the Vichy French. In early 1942, the Australian government decided to bring the 6th Division back to Australia to help bolster its defences following Japan's entry into the war. Consequently, in March the battalion embarked from Suez on the transport HMT Otranto, bound for Australia.|$|E
