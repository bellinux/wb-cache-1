5|$|At room temperature, {{hydrogen}} bromide is a colourless gas, {{like all the}} hydrogen halides apart from hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative bromine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline {{hydrogen bromide}} at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised. Aqueous hydrogen bromide is known as hydrobromic acid, which is a strong acid (pKa = −9) because the hydrogen bonds to bromine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HBr/H2O system also involves many hydrates HBr·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, which are essentially salts of bromine anions and hydronium cations. Hydrobromic acid forms an <b>azeotrope</b> with boiling point 124.3°C at 47.63g HBr per 100g solution; thus hydrobromic acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.|$|E

Hydrochloric acid is a strong acid (pKa = −7) because the hydrogen bonds to chlorine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HCl/H2O system has many hydrates HCl·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Beyond a 1:1 mixture of HCl and H2O, the system separates completely into two separate liquid phases.

25|$|Other {{methods of}} {{separation}} involve introducing an additional agent, called an entrainer, {{that will affect}} the volatility {{of one of the}} <b>azeotrope</b> constituents more than another. When an entrainer is added to a binary <b>azeotrope</b> to form a ternary <b>azeotrope,</b> and the resulting mixture distilled, the method is called azeotropic distillation. The best known example is adding benzene or cyclohexane to the water/ethanol <b>azeotrope.</b> With cyclohexane as the entrainer, the ternary <b>azeotrope</b> is 7% water, 17% ethanol, and 76% cyclohexane, and boils at 62.1°C. Just enough cyclohexane is added to the water/ethanol <b>azeotrope</b> to engage all of the water into the ternary <b>azeotrope.</b> When the mixture is then boiled, the <b>azeotrope</b> vaporizes leaving a residue composed almost entirely of the excess ethanol.|$|E
25|$|The {{rules for}} {{positive}} and negative azeotropes apply to all the examples discussed so far. But there are some examples that don't fit into the categories of positive or negative azeotropes. The best known {{of these is the}} ternary <b>azeotrope</b> formed by 30% acetone, 47% chloroform, and 23% methanol, which boils at 57.5°C. Each pair of these constituents forms a binary <b>azeotrope,</b> but chloroform/methanol and acetone/methanol both form positive azeotropes while chloroform/acetone forms a negative <b>azeotrope.</b> The resulting ternary <b>azeotrope</b> is neither positive nor negative. Its boiling point falls between the boiling points of acetone and chloroform, so it is neither a maximum nor a minimum boiling point. This type of system is called a saddle <b>azeotrope.</b> Only systems of three or more constituents can form saddle azeotropes.|$|E

25|$|Immiscible liquids, such {{as water}} and toluene, easily form azeotropes. Commonly, these azeotropes are {{referred}} to as a low boiling <b>azeotrope</b> because the boiling point of the <b>azeotrope</b> is lower than the boiling point of either pure component. The temperature and composition of the <b>azeotrope</b> is easily predicted from the vapor pressure of the pure components, without use of Raoult's law. The <b>azeotrope</b> is easily broken in a distillation set-up by using a liquid–liquid separator (a decanter) to separate the two liquid layers that are condensed overhead. Only one of the two liquid layers is refluxed to the distillation set-up.|$|E
25|$|A {{hypothetical}} <b>azeotrope</b> of constituents X and Y {{is shown}} in the adjacent diagram. Two at an arbitrarily chosen low pressure and another at an arbitrarily chosen, but higher, pressure. The composition of the <b>azeotrope</b> is substantially different between the high- and low-pressure plots – higher in X for the high-pressure system. The goal is to separate X in as high a concentration as possible starting from point A. At the low pressure, it is possible by progressive distillation to reach a distillate at the point, B, which is {{on the same side of}} the <b>azeotrope</b> as A. Note that successive distillation steps near the azeotropic composition exhibit very little difference in boiling temperature. If this distillate is now exposed to the high pressure, it boils at point C. From C, by progressive distillation it is possible to reach a distillate at the point D, which is on the same side of the high-pressure <b>azeotrope</b> as C. If that distillate is then exposed again to the low pressure, it boils at point E, which is on the opposite side of the low-pressure <b>azeotrope</b> to A.

25|$|An {{example of}} a {{negative}} <b>azeotrope</b> is hydrochloric acid at a concentration of 20.2% and 79.8% water (by mass). Hydrogen chloride boils at −84°C and water at 100°C, but the <b>azeotrope</b> boils at 110°C, which is higher than either of its constituents. The maximum temperature at which any hydrochloric acid solution can boil is 110°C. In general, a negative <b>azeotrope</b> boils at a higher temperature than any other ratio of its constituents.

40|$|Within {{the last}} decade, {{reactive}} distillation {{has become increasingly}} attractive as a potential process alternative for simultaneously conducting liquid-phase reaction and vapor-liquid separation, {{with the potential to}} overcome chemical equilibrium limitations and to simplify flowsheets. This dissertation develops a systematic steady-state design methodology for kinetically controlled, stagewise reactive distillation columns, taking into account a single isomolar or non-isomolar liquid phase reaction, heat effects, nonideal vapor-liquid equilibrium, and a distribution of liquid holdups on the reactive stages. “Kinetically controlled” means that chemical reaction equilibrium is not obtained on every tray, although vapor-liquid equilibrium is assumed. “Stagewise” implies a column consisting of discrete trays. The method is useful for developing a spectrum of feasible designs over a range of design conditions, which provides insight into the effect of such variables as reboil ratio, heat of reaction and Damkohler number on the total number of stages. The method is demonstrated by developing feasible column designs for the dehydration of methanol, the metathesis of 2 -pentene, and the production of ethylene glycol. ^ The influence of <b>azeotropes</b> on the design of ordinary distillation columns has been widely studied for many years. <b>Azeotropes</b> alter product distributions and attainable regions; cause distillation boundaries to occur; and have {{led to the creation of}} extractive and azeotropic distillation technology. It can be expected that reactive <b>azeotropes</b> have a similar impact on reactive distillation design. However, the influence that key physical property parameters (such as the reaction equilibrium constant) exert on reactive <b>azeotropes</b> is relatively unknown. New tools are needed to determine when reactive systems will exhibit reactive <b>azeotropes</b> and how these <b>azeotropes</b> will influence designs. Such a tool is described in this dissertation: an arc-length continuation technique used to determine the existence and location of both homogeneous and heterogeneous reactive <b>azeotropes</b> in an equilibrium reactive system. ^ Using the techniques and methods developed, the use of reactive distillation in nontraditional applications are explored, such as in a system possessing a small reaction equilibrium constant (Keq 2 ̆ 6 Lt; 1) or kinetically resolving enantiomers from a racemic mixture. ...|$|R
25|$|Ethylene {{hydration}} or brewing {{produces an}} ethanol–water mixture. For most industrial and fuel uses, the ethanol must be purified. Fractional distillation at atmospheric pressure can concentrate ethanol to 95.6% by weight (89.5 mole%). This mixture is an <b>azeotrope</b> with a boiling point of , and cannot be further purified by distillation. Addition of an entraining agent, such as benzene, cyclohexane, or heptane, allows a new ternary <b>azeotrope</b> comprising the ethanol, water, and the entraining agent to be formed. This lower-boiling ternary <b>azeotrope</b> is removed preferentially, leading to water-free ethanol.|$|E
25|$|If the point, A {{had been}} chosen {{to the right of}} the <b>azeotrope</b> rather than to the left, the {{distillate}} at point C would be farther to the right than A, which is to say that the distillate would be richer in X and poorer in Y than the original mixture. So in this case too, the distillate moves away from the <b>azeotrope</b> and the residue moves toward it. This is characteristic of negative azeotropes.

25|$|If two {{solvents}} {{can form}} a positive <b>azeotrope,</b> then distillation of any mixture of those constituents {{will result in}} the distillate being closer in composition to the <b>azeotrope</b> than the starting mixture. For example, if a 50/50 mixture of ethanol and water is distilled once, the distillate will be 80% ethanol and 20% water, which is closer to the azeotropic mixture than the original. Distilling the 80/20% mixture produces a distillate that is 87% ethanol and 13% water. Further repeated distillations will produce mixtures that are progressively closer to the azeotropic ratio of 95.5/4.5%. No numbers of distillations will ever result in a distillate that exceeds the azeotropic ratio. Likewise, when distilling a mixture of ethanol and water that is richer in ethanol than the <b>azeotrope,</b> the distillate (contrary to intuition) will be poorer in ethanol than the original but slightly richer than the <b>azeotrope.</b> This means the solution left behind will be richer in ethanol.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes azeotropes {{are useful}} in {{separating}} zeotropic mixtures. An example is acetic acid and water, which do not form an <b>azeotrope.</b> Despite this {{it is very difficult}} to separate pure acetic acid (boiling point: 118.1°C) from a solution of acetic acid and water by distillation alone. As progressive distillations produce solutions with less and less water, each further distillation becomes less effective at removing the remaining water. Distilling the solution to dry acetic acid is therefore economically impractical. But ethyl acetate forms an <b>azeotrope</b> with water that boils at 70.4°C.
