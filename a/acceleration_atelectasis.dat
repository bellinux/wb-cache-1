The coughing symptoms {{have been attributed to}} <b>acceleration</b> <b>atelectasis</b> ("collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange"), which may be exacerbated by the F-22's high performance. The presence of toxins and particles in some ground crew was deemed to be unrelated. On 4 April 2013, the distance and altitude flight restrictions were lifted after the F-22 Combined Test Force and 412th Aerospace Medicine Squadron determined that breathing restrictions on the pilot were responsible as opposed to an issue with the oxygen provided.|$|E
40|$|Background Flying high {{performance}} aircraft subjects the pilot to physical stress {{beyond the limits}} of human tolerance. The pilot faces challenges such as G-forces, low pressure environment and hypoxic air. Some research was done in the mid- 1900 s to explore the effects of flying on the human body. However, most research focused on topics relevant for enhancing the pilot s performance in the working situation in cockpit, less on pathologic effects of flying. Knowing {{that a lot of the}} physical stress on the pilot during {{high performance}} flying is directly affecting the lungs, the aim of this paper has been to answer the following question: How does high performance flying affect pulmonary function, both in the short and long term? Method I did a systematic search on PubMed and read titles and abstracts of 597 articles, selecting 11 relevant articles for a critical review. Further I did non-systematic searches in the NATO AGARD-library, UpToDate, and reference lists. I also used Ernsting s Aviation Medicine (4 th ed., 2006), one of the most renowned textbooks of aviation medicine. Results There is good evidence that increasing G-forces change the ventilation-perfusion equilibrium in the lungs. Breathing 100 % oxygen results in absorption atelectasis. G-forces, 100 % oxygen and G-suits all contribute to <b>acceleration</b> <b>atelectasis</b> and reduced vital capacity (VC). There is also evidence that poisonous gases and ozone present in cockpit may cause inflammation in the airways. The potential pathological effects of Positive Pressure Breathing (PPB) are unknown. As for long term effects only a few studies exist and the results are inconsistent. The research is more than 20 years old â€“ thus it has not taken into account effects of fourth generation fighter planes introduced in the 80 s and 90 s. In addition these studies lack certain quality requirements that apply to research today. Conclusion High performance flying has immediate effects on lung function, both as a result of the flying itself and by the variety of aids that help the pilot maintain his function in a physically demanding situation. There is a great lack of knowledge about high performance flying and long term pathologic effects on pulmonary function. Further research on the topic is required...|$|E
