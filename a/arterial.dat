5|$|Subarachnoid hemorrage due to <b>arterial</b> rupture {{typically}} occurs if the dissection extends {{into the}} V4 {{section of the}} artery. This {{may be explained by}} the fact that the <b>arterial</b> wall is thinner and lacks a number of structural supports in this section.|$|E
5|$|The <b>arterial</b> bubble {{assumption}} is that the filtering capacity of the lung has a threshold radius {{of the size of}} a red blood cell and that sufficiently small decompression bubbles can pass to the <b>arterial</b> side, especially during the initial phase of ascent. Later in the ascent, bubbles grow to a larger size and remain trapped in the lung. This may explain why conventional Doppler measurements have not detected any bubbles in the <b>arterial</b> circulation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Arterials</b> {{are major}} through roads that are {{expected}} to carry large volumes of traffic. <b>Arterials</b> are often divided into major and minor <b>arterials,</b> and rural and urban <b>arterials.</b>|$|R
40|$|Many {{metropolitan}} {{areas in the}} United States are experiencing explosive vehicular volume growth on major <b>arterials.</b> Several decades of steady increases in vehicle miles traveled (VMT), heightened freeway congestion and expanded urban centers have all increased the traffic-carrying importance of major <b>arterials.</b> This places a greater modern-day burden on these <b>arterials</b> to carry more long-distanc...|$|R

5|$|The <b>arterial</b> partial {{pressures}} of oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} in the <b>arterial</b> blood are homeostatically controlled. A rise in the <b>arterial</b> partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and, to a lesser extent, a fall in the <b>arterial</b> partial pressure of oxygen, will reflexly cause deeper and faster breathing till the blood gas tensions return to normal. The converse happens when the carbon dioxide tension falls, or, again to a lesser extent, the oxygen tension rises: the rate and depth of breathing are reduced till blood gas normality is restored.|$|E
5|$|The partial {{pressures}} of oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} in the <b>arterial</b> blood are measured by the peripheral chemoreceptors – the aortic and carotid bodies, and the central chemoreceptors of the medulla oblongata of the brainstem. The peripheral chemoreceptors are more sensitive to the <b>arterial</b> partial pressure of oxygen than they are to the <b>arterial</b> partial pressure of carbon dioxide. The central chemoreceptor is particularly sensitive to the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid, which is directly influenced by the partial pressure of {{carbon dioxide in the}} <b>arterial</b> blood.|$|E
5|$|As NY38 enters Auburn, {{it passes}} by Auburn High School before heading north through densely {{populated}} blocks filled with homes. The divided highway ends abruptly at Swift Street, where NY38 turns west {{to follow the}} two-lane undivided Swift Street west for seven blocks to NY34 (South Street). Here, NY38 leaves Swift Street and joins NY34 on South Street. The two routes follow South Street past the William H. Seward House into downtown Auburn, where the homes are replaced with businesses at Lincoln Street. Three blocks later, South Street intersects with the East <b>Arterial</b> (eastbound US20 and NY5). The overlap between NY34 and NY38 ends one block later at the West <b>Arterial</b> (westbound US20 and NY5), where NY38 turns to follow the <b>Arterial</b> for a block to the west.|$|E
50|$|The City and County of Denver's zoning board classifies streets {{into three}} types based on functionality. <b>Arterials</b> are major routes, {{arranged}} in a network to provide mobility around the city. Collector streets move traffic from <b>arterials</b> into neighborhoods and business districts. All other streets are local streets, which provide access to individual lots.|$|R
50|$|Principal <b>arterials</b> are 1st and 4th avenues S, the Alaskan Way Viaduct, East Marginal and Airport ways S (north- and southbound); and S Spokane, the Spokane Street Viaduct, West Seattle Bridge, and S Royal Brougham Way (east- and westbound). Minor <b>arterials</b> are 6th Avenue S, S Holgate and S Lander streets, and S Industrial Way.|$|R

5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} and <b>arterial</b> gas embolism in recreational diving {{are associated with}} certain demographic, environmental, and dive style factors. A statistical study published in 2005 tested potential risk factors: age, gender, body mass index, smoking, asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, previous decompression illness, years since certification, dives in the last year, number of diving days, number of dives in a repetitive series, last dive depth, nitrox use, and drysuit use. No significant associations with risk of decompression sickness or <b>arterial</b> gas embolism were found for asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, smoking, or body mass index. Increased depth, previous DCI, larger number of consecutive days diving, and being male were associated with higher risk for decompression {{sickness and}} <b>arterial</b> gas embolism. Nitrox and drysuit use, greater frequency of diving in the past year, increasing age, and years since certification were associated with lower risk, possibly as indicators of more extensive training and experience.|$|E

5|$|If the {{compressed}} {{air in a}} diver's lungs cannot freely escape during an ascent, particularly a rapid one, then the lung tissues may rupture, causing pulmonary barotrauma (PBT). The air may then enter the <b>arterial</b> circulation producing <b>arterial</b> gas embolism (AGE), with effects similar to severe decompression sickness. Although AGE may occur {{as a result of}} other causes, it is most often secondary to PBT. AGE is the second most common cause of death while diving (drowning being the most common stated cause of death). Gas bubbles within the <b>arterial</b> circulation can block the supply of blood to any part of the body, including the brain, and can therefore manifest a vast variety of symptoms. The following table presents those signs and symptoms which have been observed in more than ten percent of cases diagnosed as AGE, with approximate estimates of frequency.|$|E
40|$|Many <b>arterials</b> are hopelessly congested. In many places, {{engineers}} have done {{as much as}} they can with conventional improvements. Advances like intelligent transportation systems will not provide widespread assistance on <b>arterials</b> for many years. To help treat this impasse, the first author wrote a series for ITE describing seven unconventional design alternatives for <b>arterials.</b> The purposes of this paper are to review five of those alternatives—the median U-turn, bowtie, superstreet, jughandle, and continuous flow intersection—and to summarize new information about them. After presenting the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative, the paper suggests when analysts should consider one during feasibility studies and functional designs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} designs, {{advantages and}} some drawbacks of various layouts of roundabouts with traffic signals, used in urban <b>arterials</b> on crossings with large traffic volumes. The authors analyze signal settings with alternative phasing used at intersections {{that can provide}} the intersection capacity of about 6500 veh/h in 2 x 2 lanes <b>arterials</b> or even 8000 veh/h in 2 x 3 lanes <b>arterials.</b> Accident statistics for roundabouts with traffic signals in Krakow are also given and discussed. In addition, presented are practical examples of changes of signalized roundabouts geometry; reconstruction into a form of turbo-roundabout and its effects regarding traffic safety and good performance...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, {{construction}} began {{on a new}} <b>arterial</b> highway—known as the North–South Arterial—through downtown Utica. The first portion of the highway to open was the segment between River Road and Trenton Road, which was completed by 1956. It was extended southward to Oriskany Street (NY5A) by 1961 and completed entirely by 1964; however, NY8 was not initially realigned to follow the highway. In the mid-1960s, plans were made to construct a new limited-access highway along the NY8 corridor from Clayville north to New Hartford, where it would connect with the North–South <b>Arterial.</b>|$|E
