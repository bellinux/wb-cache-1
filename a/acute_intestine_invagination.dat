Three cases of benign tumours {{of the small}} intestine, histologically diagnosed as leiomyoma, fibroma and hamartoma., are presented, and the literature is revised emphasizing issues of pathophysiology, specific characteristics and the treatment of these tumours.

40|$|Systemic {{administration}} of polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), mimics virally-induced activation of TLR 3 signalling causing <b>acute</b> small <b>intestine</b> damage, but {{whether and how}} mucosal {{administration of}} poly I:C causes enteropathy is less clear. Our aim {{was to investigate the}} inflammatory pathways elicited after intraluminal administration of poly I:C and determine acute and delayed consequences of this locally induced immune activation. Intraluminal poly I:C induced rapid mucosal immune activation in C 57 BL/ 6 mice involving IFNb and the CXCL 10 /CXCR 3 axis, that may drive inflammation towards a Th 1 profile. Intraluminal poly I:C also caused enteropathy and gut dysfunction in gliadin-sensitive NOD-DQ 8 mice, and this was prolonged by concomitant oral administration of gliadin. Our results indicate that small intestine pathology can be induced in mice by intraluminal administration of poly I:C and that this is exacerbated by subsequent oral delivery of a relevant dietary antigen...|$|R
40|$|Ectopic varices are dilated portosystemic venous {{collaterals}} located {{outside of}} the gastro-esophageal region. Whereas they are common endoscopic findings in patients with portal hypertension, ectopic variceal bleeding is rather rare and accounts for only 1 to 5 % of all variceal bleedings. The rectum and the duodenum {{are the most common}} sites for ectopic varices, but they can be present along the whole intestinal tract and neighborhood. At present, there is no consensus well established on diagnostic workup for ectopic variceal bleeding and their therapeutic strategies. Further investigation of large series or randomized-controlled trials is needed because nowadays most of the data available are based on case reports. We report here an unusual case of an ectopic variceal bleeding, presented as an <b>acute</b> small <b>intestine</b> bleeding, due to a portosystemic shunt via dilated mesenteric veins and a varicous left ovarian vein in a patient with alcoholic cirrhosis. The involvement of an ovarian vein in ectopic variceal bleeding is rarely described. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) {{injury is}} a serious {{clinical}} pathophysiological process that may result in <b>acute</b> local <b>intestine</b> and remote liver injury. Protocatechuic acid (PCA), which has been widely studied as a polyphenolic compound, induces expression of antioxidative genes that combat oxidative stress and cell apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the effect of PCA pretreatment for protecting intestinal I/R-induced local intestine and remote liver injury in mice. Intestinal I/R was established by superior mesenteric artery occlusion for 45 [*]min followed by reperfusion for 90 [*]min. After the reperfusion period, PCA pretreatment markedly alleviated intestine and liver injury induced by intestinal I/R as indicated by histological alterations, decreases in serological damage parameters and nuclear factor-kappa B and phospho-foxo 3 a protein expression levels, and increases in glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, manganese superoxide dismutase protein expression, and Bcl-xL protein expression in the intestine and liver. These parameters were accompanied by PCA-induced adaptor protein p 66 shc suppression. These results suggest that PCA has a significant protective effect in the intestine and liver following injury induced by intestinal I/R. The protective effect of PCA {{may be attributed to}} the suppression of p 66 shc and the regulation of p 66 shc-related antioxidative and antiapoptotic factors...|$|R
40|$|Prolonged {{ingestion}} of a cholesterol- or saturated fatty acid-enriched diet induces chronic, often systemic, auto-inflammatory responses resulting in significant health problems worldwide. In vivo {{information regarding the}} local and direct inflammatory effect of these dietary components in the intestine and, in particular, on the intestinal epithelium is lacking. Here we report that both mice and zebrafish exposed to high-fat (HFDs) or high-cholesterol (HCDs) diets develop acute innate inflammatory responses within hours, reflected in the localized interleukin- 1 b-dependent accumulation of myeloid cells in the <b>intestine.</b> <b>Acute</b> HCD-induced intestinal inflammation is dependent on cholesterol uptake via Niemann-Pick C 1 -like 1 and inflammasome activation involving apoptosis-associated Speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain, which leads to Caspase- 1 activity in intestinal epithelial cells. Extended exposure to HCD results in localized, inflammation-dependent, functional dysregulation as well as systemic pathologies. Our model suggests that dietary cholesterol initiates intestinal inflammation in epithelial cells...|$|R
40|$|Background: The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the {{protective}} efficacy of l-carnitine (LC) to amifostine on radiation-induced <b>acute</b> small <b>intestine</b> damage. Materials and Methods: Thirty, 4 -week-old Wistar albino rats were randomly assigned to four groups - Group 1 : control (CONT, n = 6), Group 2 : irradiation alone (RT, n = 8), Group 3 : amifostine plus irradiation (AMI+RT, n = 8), and Group 4 : l-Carnitine plus irradiation (LC+RT, n = 8). The rats in all groups were irradiated individually with a single dose of 20 Gy to the total abdomen, except those in CONT. LC (300 mg/kg) or amifostine (200 mg/kg) was used 30 min before irradiation. Histopathological analysis of small intestine was carried out after euthanasia. Results: Pretreatment with amifostine reduced the radiation-induced acute degenerative damage (P = 0. 009) compared to the RT group. Pretreatment with LC did not obtain any significant difference compared to the RT group. The vascular damage significantly reduced in both of the AMI+RT (P = 0. 003) and LC+RT group (P = 0. 029) compared to the RT group. The overall damage score was significantly lower in the AMI+RT group than the RT group (P = 0. 009). There was not any significant difference between the LC+RT and RT group. Conclusions: Amifostine has a marked radioprotective effect against all histopathological changes on small intestinal tissue while LC has limited effects which are mainly on vascular structure...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Curcuma {{has long}} been used as an {{anti-inflammatory}} agent in inflammatory bowel disease. Since gastrointestinal motility is impaired in inflammatory states, {{the aim of this}} work was to evaluate if Curcuma Longa had any effect on intestinal motility. METHODS: The biological activity of Curcuma extract was evaluated against Carbachol induced contraction in isolated mice <b>intestine.</b> <b>Acute</b> and chronic colitis were induced in Balb/c mice by Dextran Sulphate Sodium administration (5 % and 2. 5 % respectively) and either Curcuma extract (200 mg/kg/day) or placebo was thereafter administered for 7 and 21 days respectively. Spontaneous contractions and the response to Carbachol and Atropine of ileum and colon were studied after colitis induction and Curcuma administration. RESULTS: Curcuma extract reduced the spontaneous contractions in the ileum and colon; the maximal response to Carbachol was inhibited in a non-competitive and reversible manner. Similar results were obtained in ileum and colon from Curcuma fed mice. DSS administration decreased the motility, mainly in the colon and Curcuma almost restored both the spontaneous contractions and the response to Carbachol after 14 days assumption, compared to standard diet, but a prolonged assumption of Curcuma decreased the spontaneous and Carbachol-induced contractions. CONCLUSIONS: Curcuma extract has a direct and indirect myorelaxant effect on mouse ileum and colon, independent of the anti-inflammatory effect. The indirect effect is reversible and non-competitive with the cholinergic agent. These results suggest the use of curcuma extract as a spasmolytic agent...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} acute (AR) and chronic {{rejection}} (CR) on intestinal smooth muscle {{that are responsible}} for the dysmotility following small bowel transplantation (SBTX) are incompletely understood. Jejunal and ileal specimens from normal control dogs (n= 7), and autotransplanted dogs were examined at 7 days (n= 6) and 1 (n= 7), 3 (n= 6), 6 (n= 6), and 12 months (n= 6). Allotransplanted dogs that developed AR (n= 8) and CR (n= 5) were examined for gross and microscopic morphology (muscle thickness, the number and size of myocytes, and inflammatory infiltrate), and for contractile and intracellular electrical function in vitro. Auto-SBTX did not alter morphology at any period, but contractile function was impaired at 7 days (73. 6 %) compared with normal <b>intestine.</b> <b>Acute</b> rejection did not influence myocyte number or size, but was associated with a prominent infiltrate of neutrophils and lymphocytes, and severely impaired contractile function (20. 6 %) compared with auto-SBTX controls. Acute rejection also significantly inhibited the amplitude of slow waves and of inhibitory junction potentials. Chronic rejection caused thickening of muscularis propria by both hyperplasia (175. 5 %) and hypertrophy (202. 6 %) accompanied by moderate inflammatory cell infiltrate compared with auto-SBTX controls. We conclude that the marked inflammatory infiltrate into the muscularis propria indicates that the graft muscle is injured by both acute and chronic rejection; impaired function of intestinal smooth muscle following SBTX results from both rejection and the injury associated with transplantation, and chronic rejection following SBTX is associated with both hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the muscularis propria...|$|R
40|$|Specimens of farmed European {{sea bass}} (Dicentrarchus labrax L., 1758) {{were exposed to}} {{different}} cadmium (Cd) concentrations (4. 47, 5. 63, 7. 08 and 8. 91 mg l- 1) for 24 and 48 hours. The effects of Cd on numbers of some cell types and structures (i. e. chloride cells, CCs; macrophage aggregates, MAs; rodlet cells, RCs) and on structure and ultrastructure of the main organs (gill, liver, intestine, kidney) were studied with routine process for light and transmission electron microscopy. Following cadmium exposure, the numbers of branchial CCs as well as intestinal and renal RCs increased significantly within 24 h. Increase in metal concentration {{did not affect the}} magnitude of the numerical increment of the aforementioned cells. Moreover, in treated fish (24 and 48 h) the numbers of MAs in both head kidney and spleen were significantly higher than in control conspecifics, whilst the global area of MAs was less influenced by the acute treatment. In exposed sea bass, all the examined organs exhibited cellular modifications which appeared time- and dose-dependent. The gills showed telangectasia, lamellar fusion, oedema, epithelial lifting and leukocyte infiltration. In the liver, kidney and <b>intestine</b> <b>acute</b> cell swelling and vacuolization were common. Ultrastructurally the alterations observed frequently in hepatocytes, tubular epithelial cells and enterocytes included presence of numerous myelinoid bodies, damaged mitochondria, dilatation of endoplasmic reticulum, high number of lysosomes and autophagolysosomes.

40|$|The anaphylatoxin {{derived from}} the fifth {{component}} of the human complement system (C 5 a) mediates its effects by binding to a single high-affinity receptor (C 5 aR/CD 88), the expression {{of which has been}} traditionally thought to be restricted to granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages (Mϕ), and cell lines of myeloid origin. Recent immunohistochemical data suggested that human bronchial and alveolar cells express C 5 aR as well. To reexamine the tissue distribution of human C 5 aR expression, transcription of the C 5 aR gene was investigated in normal and pathologically affected human lung (bronchopneumonia, tuberculosis), large <b>intestine</b> (<b>acute</b> appendicitis, Crohn’s disease), and skin (pyogenic granuloma, lichen planus) using in situ hybridization. In contrast to previous evidence, C 5 aR mRNA could not be detected in pulmonary or intestinal epithelial cells, whereas keratinocytes in inflamed but not in normal skin revealed detectable levels of C 5 aR transcripts. Additionally, it could be documented that only migrating Mϕ express C 5 aR mRNA, whereas sessile Mϕ in normal tissues and epithelioid/multinucleated Mϕ found in granulomatous lesions do not. Because C 5 a has been demonstrated to upregulate the expression of interleukin (IL) - 6 in human monocytes, we also studied IL- 6 gene transcription in parallel to the C 5 aR. IL- 6 mRNA was detectable in many tissue Mϕ. Surprisingly, a tight co-expression of C 5 aR and IL- 6 mRNA was observed in keratinocytes from lesions of pyogenic granuloma and lichen planus. These results point to an as yet unknown role for C 5 a in the pathogenesis of skin disorders beyond its well-defined function as a chemoattractant and activator of leukocytes...|$|R
40|$|CCL 25 /CCR 9 is a non-promiscuous chemokine/receptor pair {{and a key}} {{regulator}} of leukocyte {{migration to}} the small intestine. We investigated here whether CCL 25 /CCR 9 interactions {{also play a role}} in the regulation of inflammatory responses in the large <b>intestine.</b> <b>Acute</b> inflammation and recovery in wild-type (WT) and CCR 9 (-/-) mice was studied in a model of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) -induced colitis. Distribution studies and phenotypic characterization of dendritic cell subsets and macrophage were performed by flow cytometry. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) scores were assessed and expression of inflammatory cytokines was studied at the mRNA and the protein level. CCL 25 and CCR 9 are both expressed in the large intestine and are upregulated during DSS colitis. CCR 9 (-/-) mice are more susceptible to DSS colitis than WT littermate controls as shown by higher mortality, increased IBD score and delayed recovery. During recovery, the CCR 9 (-/-) colonic mucosa is characterized by the accumulation of activated macrophages and elevated levels of Th 1 /Th 17 inflammatory cytokines. Activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DCs) accumulate in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) of CCR 9 (-/-) animals, altering the local ratio of DC subsets. Upon re-stimulation, T cells isolated from these MLNs secrete significantly higher levels of TNFα, IFNγ, IL 2, IL- 6 and IL- 17 A while down modulating IL- 10 production. Our results demonstrate that CCL 25 /CCR 9 interactions regulate inflammatory immune responses in the large intestinal mucosa by balancing different subsets of dendritic cells. These findings have important implications for the use of CCR 9 -inhibitors in therapy of human IBD as they indicate a potential risk for patients with large intestinal inflammation...|$|R
40|$|The coordinated {{recirculation}} {{and directed}} recruitment of lymphocytes to intestinal tissue {{is a prerequisite}} to maintain mucosal immunity. γδ T-cells, a small subset of lymphocytes, have already been identified as important immunoregulators during intestinal inflammation. A coordinated migration of γδ T-cells to the inflamed large intestine {{is supported by the}} expression of tissue-specific adhesion molecules and integrins as wells as a selective combination of homing receptors. The aim of this thesis was to analyze whether regulated migration represents a prerequisite for local differentiation and function of γδ T-cells under homeostatic conditions as well as during intestinal inflammation. First, function and phenotype of γδ T-cells from peritoneal cavity were characterized under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions. Secondly, it was investigated if the peritoneal microenvironment modulates γδ T-cell function and plasticity and whether this peritoneal imprinting alters the recirculation behavior of γδ T-cells. Finally, the kinetics of peritoneal γδ T-cell migration into the gut under homeostatic conditions as well as during an acute DSS-induced colitis were studied. Phenotypic and functional aspects of γδ T-cells in the different organs spleen, peritoneal cavity and large intestine were analyzed and then compared with those during an acute colitis. A proportion of γδ T-cells expressed the characteristic homing factors CCR 6, LFA- 1, CD 44, α 4 β 7 and α 4 β 1 which are associated with migration into the large intestine. Peritoneal γδ T-cells displayed a more activated and mature phenotype than splenic γδ T-cells. It could be shown, that the frequency of IL- 17 producing γδ T-cells in the peritoneal cavity was significantly higher than in the spleen. γδ T-cells and the IL- 17 producing subpopulation have been further characterized: Peritoneal γδ T-cells are CD 27 + and CD 8 α-, the IL- 17 producing subpopulation is CD 27 negative. CD 27 could be identified as a unique differentiation marker between IL 17 + und IL 17 - γδ T-cells in peritoneal cavity. In the large intestine, γδ T-cells of the lamina propria and the intraepithelial compartment express CD 8 α. IL- 17 producing γδ T-cells in both compartments were negative for CD 8 α. Additionally, transcription factor gene expression levels of peritoneal in comparison to splenic γδ T-cells were analyzed. Peritoneal γδ T-cells revealed an increased expression of characteristic transcription factors regulating the differentiation of TH 17 cells. Interestingly, when injected intraperitoneally, Wt splenic γδ T-cells acquired the homing receptor pattern of peritoneal γδ T-cells and profoundly changed their phenotype. Based on these transfer experiments, for the first time, the functional plasticity of peripherally circulating γδ T-cells and the relevance of the peritoneal cavity during imprinting processes could be demonstrated. Splenic γδ T-cells adoptively transferred into the peritoneal cavity could be recovered in the lamina propria and the intraepithelial compartment of the non- or inflamed colon showing {{for the first time that}} γδ T-cells migrate from the peritoneal cavity into the mucosal tissue of the gut. Comparative transfer experiments confirmed that recruitment of γδ T-cells from the peritoneal cavity is similarly effective to homing of γδ T-cells from the venous way. In summary, tissue-specific cues of the peritoneal cavity affect functionality, phenotype, migratory and differentiation capacity of γδ T-cells. The directed migration of γδ T-cells to the <b>acute</b> inflamed large <b>intestine</b> is supported by imprinting mechanisms in the peritoneal environment...|$|R
