30|$|Saline soil {{collected}} (0 – 20  cm depth) from an {{area where}} the field experiment was carried out at Shinille <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Experimental</b> Site was used for conducting the greenhouse experiment. A plant growth medium containing soil from Shinille <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Experimental</b> Site was prepared based the absence of indigenous bradyrhizobia nodulating soybean to facilitate the visual identification of N-deficiency symptoms in plants nodulated by the specific strain. The soil was collected and dried under aseptic conditions and no rhizobia were detected by a plant infection technique at sowing (Brockwell 1963). Nitrogen (i.e. 20  kg ha- 1 based) in the form of urea was applied for N treated pots. Six soybean genotypes, three of which were late maturing (Wogayen, TGx- 1336424 and Belsa) and the remaining three (GIZA, Afgat and Gishame) were medium maturing, were used for greenhouse experiment.|$|R
