2500|$|Remote sensing, {{as used in}} meteorology, is {{the concept}} of {{collecting}} data from remote weather events and subsequently producing weather information. The common types of remote sensing are Radar, Lidar, and satellites (or photogrammetry). Each collects data about the atmosphere from a remote location and, usually, stores the data where the instrument is located. Radar <b>and</b> <b>Lidar</b> are not passive because both use EM radiation to illuminate a specific portion of the atmosphere. [...] Weather satellites along with more general-purpose Earth-observing satellites circling the earth at various altitudes have become an indispensable tool for studying a wide range of phenomena from forest fires to El Niño.|$|E

The deviation between the two profiles is smaller than 10 percent up to an altitude of 5 km. Furthermore, the intercomparison between <b>lidar</b> <b>and</b> radiosonde data <b>and</b> between <b>lidar</b> <b>and</b> satellite data is performed also in terms of water vapor columnar content. The agreement between <b>lidar</b> <b>and</b> radiosonde columnar content is better than 4 percent.

2500|$|The first working laser was {{demonstrated}} on 16 May 1960 by Theodore Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories. When first invented, {{they were called}} [...] "a solution looking for a problem". Since then, lasers have become a multibillion-dollar industry, finding utility in thousands of highly varied applications. The first application of lasers visible in {{the daily lives of}} the general population was the supermarket barcode scanner, introduced in 1974. The laserdisc player, introduced in 1978, was the first successful consumer product to include a laser, but the compact disc player was the first laser-equipped device to become truly common in consumers' homes, beginning in 1982. These optical storage devices use a semiconductor laser less than a millimetre wide to scan the surface of the disc for data retrieval. Fibre-optic communication relies on lasers to transmit large amounts of information at the speed of light. Other common applications of lasers include laser printers and laser pointers. Lasers are used in medicine in areas such as bloodless surgery, laser eye surgery, and laser capture microdissection and in military applications such as missile defence systems, electro-optical countermeasures (EOCM), <b>and</b> <b>lidar.</b> Lasers are also used in holograms, bubblegrams, laser light shows, and laser hair removal.|$|E

40|$|The Tropospheric Ozone Lidar Network (TOLNet) is {{a unique}} network of lidar systems that measure {{high-resolution}} atmospheric profiles of ozone. The accurate characterization of these lidars is necessary to determine the uniformity of the network calibration. From July to August 2014, three lidars, the TROPospheric OZone (TROPOZ) lidar, the Tunable Optical Profiler for Aerosol <b>and</b> oZone (TOPAZ) <b>lidar,</b> <b>and</b> the Langley Mobile Ozone Lidar (LMOL), of TOLNet participated in the Deriving Information on Surface conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality (DISCOVER-AQ) mission and the Front Range Air Pollution and Photochemistry Éxperiment (FRAPPÉ) to measure ozone variations from the boundary layer {{to the top of}} the troposphere.

The TOLNet lidars measured vertical ozone structures with an accuracy generally better than ± 15  % within the troposphere. Larger differences occur at some individual altitudes in both the near-field and far-field range of the lidar systems, largely as expected. In terms of column average, the TOLNet lidars measured ozone with an accuracy better than ± 5  % for both the intercomparison between the <b>lidars</b> <b>and</b> between the <b>lidars</b> <b>and</b> other instruments.

Then LUTs were implemented in the ice retrieval algorithms. We performed several sensitivity studies to evaluate uncertainties in the retrieved ice microphysics due to ice particle orientation and shape. It was found that the implementation of orientation of horizontally oriented ice plate model in the algorithm drastically improved the retrieval results in both for nadir- <b>and</b> off-nadir <b>lidar</b> pointing periods. Differences in the retrieved microphysics between only randomly oriented ice model (3 D-ice) and mixture of 3 D-ice and Q 2 Dplate model were large especially in off-nadir period, e. g., 100 % in effective radius and one order in ice water content, respectively.
