5|$|The Mendips were mined for lead, silver, coal, ochre, fuller's {{earth and}} zinc {{but this has}} finished. They were also quarried for stone, notably at Bath and Doulting. Today the Mendips are <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> aggregates.|$|E

5|$|Coyotes rarely kill healthy adult red foxes, {{and have}} been {{observed}} to feed or den alongside them, though they often kill foxes caught in traps.

5|$|Flooding is a {{frequent}} occurrence in Kuala Lumpur whenever there is a heavy downpour, especially in the city centre and downstream areas.

5|$|Hemlock logs {{were used}} to build the plank road. At that time, the tree's bark was <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> tannin used to tan leather. The wood was not used much for lumber, so {{hundreds}} of thousands of stripped hemlock logs were normally left to rot. There were sawmills and experienced lumber workers available from the local timber industry.|$|E

5|$|In some cultures, insects, {{especially}} deep-fried cicadas, {{are considered}} to be delicacies, whereas in other places they form part of the normal diet. Insects have a high protein content for their mass, and some authors suggest their potential as <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> protein in human nutrition. In most first-world countries, however, entomophagy (the eating of insects), is taboo.|$|E
5|$|Several {{otherwise}} unremarkable {{bodies in}} the outer belt show cometary activity. Because their orbits cannot be explained through capture of classical comets, {{it is thought that}} many of the outer asteroids may be icy, with the ice occasionally exposed to sublimation through small impacts. Main-belt comets may have been <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the Earth's oceans, because the deuterium–hydrogen ratio is too low for classical comets to have been the principal source.|$|E
5|$|Somerset {{today has}} only two small cities, Bath and Wells, and only small towns in {{comparison}} with other areas of England.

In this paper, {{we focus on the}} problem of suggesting suitable advertisements to news aggregation from television and from the Internet. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to perform this task in the field of multimodal aggregation. The proposed system suggests from 1 to 5 advertisements related to the main topic of aggregated news items. 15 users were asked to evaluate the relevance of the suggested advertisements. Preliminary results are encouraging for further development and application of contextual advertising in the field of multimodal aggregation...|$|R

30|$|The {{production}} of IFN-gamma by immune cells {{is an essential}} defense mechanism against many viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections (Borges da Silva et al., 2015). NK cells are <b>a</b> <b>major</b> innate <b>source</b> <b>of</b> IFN-gamma (Travar et al., 2016; Waggoner et al., 2016). Although CD 4 + T cells are <b>a</b> <b>major</b> adaptive <b>source</b> <b>of</b> IFN-gamma, their {{ability to respond to}} infection is slower than that of NK cells. NK cells produce IFN-gamma rapidly during infections, which is essential to drive the differentiation of CD 4 + T cells and induce adaptive immune responses. During HIV infections, NKG 2 A+ NK cells can quickly produce IFN-gamma to control HIV replication (Lisovsky et al., 2015), suggesting the important role of NK cells in the control of early HIV infection.|$|R
5|$|T.chatareus {{are known}} to occur in shaded areas with {{vegetation}} overhead, usually at {{the top layer of}} the water column.

5|$|Tolkien began devising the {{language}} around 1910 and restructured the grammar several times until Quenya reached its final state. The vocabulary remained relatively stable throughout the creation process. Also, {{the name of}} {{the language}} was repeatedly changed by Tolkien from Elfin and Qenya to the eventual Quenya. The Finnish language had been <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> inspiration, but Tolkien was also familiar with Latin, Greek, and ancient Germanic languages when he began constructing Quenya.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural {{improvement}} and the Industrial Revolution came to Aberdaron in the 19th century. The Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801 {{was intended to}} make it easier for landlords to enclose and improve common land, introduce increased efficiency, bring more land under the plough, and reduce the high prices of agricultural production. Rhoshirwaun Common, following strong opposition, was enclosed in 1814; while the process was not completed in Aberdaron, Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw until 1861. On the industrial front, mining developed as <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> employment, especially at Y Rhiw, where manganese was discovered in 1827.|$|E

5|$|Apparently {{opportunistic}} in feeding habits, {{the black}} dogfish typically hunts in open water, but also scavenges off the bottom. The bulk of its diet {{consists of a}} variety of bony fishes, including rattails, whitings, rockfishes, lanternfishes, and barracudinas, as well as pelagic crustaceans such as krill and shrimp, and cephalopods. Fish become a progressively more important food source as the shark ages, while crustaceans become less important. Infrequently, polychaete worms and jellyfish are also eaten. In the northwestern Atlantic, Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and rattail offal discarded from fishing vessels have become <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> food for this species, particularly for older sharks that are capable of consuming larger pieces such as heads.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1600s, the Sihanaka {{had already}} {{established}} themselves {{as one of}} the island's most important trading groups. Their location on the main trade route between the coast and the Merina capital of Antananarivo enabled them to become important trading partners beginning in the 18th century; slave trading was <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> income until outlawed under Radama I in the 1810s. The Sihanaka women also produced pottery, which was baked using wood collected by men in the surrounding forests.|$|E
5|$|Coropuna is drained by deep gorges, {{with water}} {{eventually}} reaching the Arma and Majes rivers, {{both of which}} empty into the Pacific Ocean.

Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI) were used for estimating 55 industries of the 2000 - 2006 periods. The results show that the annual average the productivity growth was 1. 25 percent. Technical change is more closely related with productivity growth rather than the technical efficiency change. The average of technical change was 6. 65 percent per annum. While technical efficiency change reveals has negative change by 1. 78 percent per annum, Based on this, implies that technological progress is <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> growth rather than technical efficiency change.
