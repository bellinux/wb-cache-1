5|$|First of <b>all,</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the 60th {{homicide}} in Newark this year, and I'm sure Congressman Tancredo has not opined {{about any}} of the other homicides, and only became interested in this one {{when it became clear that}} one of the six alleged perpetrators came to this country illegally at the age of 11. That's one thing.|$|E
5|$|Before I {{had become}} {{familiar}} with my surroundings the President sent for me. In the interview that followed he told me what he wanted, and what the failures and his disappointments had been, and proceeded to advise me as to what I should do to accomplish the purpose determined upon {{in the way of}} the new coinage. In this talk he suggested some details of action of a drastic character for my guidance, which he was positive were necessary to be adopted before success could be had. <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> delivered in his usual vigorous way, emphasizing many points by hammering on the desk with his fist.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} Beatles' {{trip to the}} United States, merchandisers pitched many {{products}} to Epstein, including Beatles clocks, pens, cigarette lighters, plastic wigs, bracelets, games, etc., but he rejected them <b>all.</b> <b>This</b> <b>was</b> because he had already allowed David Jacobs, the lawyer for NEMS, to give away 90 per cent of merchandising rights to one Nicky Byrne, in the UK. This was later deemed to be a disastrous mistake, as it left only 10 per cent for Epstein, NEMS and the Beatles. Byrne then took over Epstein's Stramsact merchandising in the UK and set up Seltaeb (Beatles spelled backwards), in the United States. While the Beatles were ensconced in the Plaza Hotel in New York, Epstein was further besieged by calls and visits from promoters, retailers, television commentators and hustlers.|$|E

5|$|Federer's next {{participation}} was in September in the inaugural Laver Cup, representing team Europe. Federer played his first singles match on day two, where he dispatched Sam Querrey in straight sets. Later on day two, he partnered with his rival Nadal in doubles, where they defeated the Team World duo of Sam Querrey and Jack Sock in the match tie breaker, {{which took place}} at one set <b>all.</b> <b>This</b> <b>was</b> the first time Federer and Nadal competed {{on the same side}} of a doubles match. On day three, Federer competed in the final match of the tournament, where he sealed victory for Team Europe by defeating Nick Kyrgios in the champion's tiebreak (saving a match point). With three wins and seven points, Federer was the most accomplished player of the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Tributary {{missions}} from vassal {{states were}} commonly allowed to include traders, who thus gained opportunities {{to do business}} in the capital markets. No doubt a large proportion of what the Chinese court chose to call tributary missions were in fact shrewdly organized commercial ventures by foreign merchants with no diplomatic status at <b>all.</b> <b>This</b> <b>was</b> unquestionably the case, most notably, with a group of traders who appeared on the south coast in 166 AD claiming to be envoys from the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.|$|E
5|$|While <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> going on, a {{decision}} was made to concentrate the commandos and Independent Companies into five large 1,000 man battalions, each of two companies. No. 4 Commando was renamed the No. 1 Company of the 3rd Special Service Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Dudley Lister. No. 2 Company was formed by the re-designation of No. 7 Commando. This new formation proved to be too large and unwieldy in practice. Within three months, the Special Service Battalions were disbanded and the original commando units reformed but on a smaller scale with six troops instead of the original ten. Each troop would comprise three officers and 62 other ranks; this number was set so each troop would fit into two Assault Landing Craft. The new formation also meant that two complete Commando units could be carried in the 'Glen' type landing ship and one unit in the 'Dutch' type landing ship.|$|E

5|$|In 1790 he {{published}} his Account of London, which {{went through a}} large number of editions. It was written in the style of his previous works and contained information on things of historical interest in the parts of the capital to which his wanderings led him. By this stage of his life he preferred to make tours in his imagination rather than in reality and {{he published}} a second edition of his Indian Zoology. He also conceived the idea of publishing a work on a global scale and set to work on the first two volumes of what was planned to be a fourteen volume series. Each country was to have maps and sketches, colour plates and an account of the country's production with notes on its natural history. <b>All</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> to be gleaned from the writing of others who had seen these places themselves. The first two volumes appeared early in 1798 and covered most of India and Ceylon. Volumes three and four included the parts of India east of the Ganges, Malaysia, Japan and China but before these were published he suffered a gradual decline in health and vigour and died at Downing, in December 1798. These two volumes were edited and published posthumously by his son, David, as were also several other short papers and an autobiographical work, The literary life of the late Thomas Pennant, Esq. By himself..|$|E
5|$|In 1992 a {{party of}} French {{academics}} attended a condensed matter conference in Ukraine where physicist Daniel Beysens introduced them {{to the story of}} how ancient Theodosia was supplied with water from dew condensers. They were sufficiently intrigued that in 1993 they went to see for themselves. They concluded that the mounds that Zibold identified as dew condensers were in fact ancient burial mounds (a part of the necropolis of antic Theodosia) and that the pipes were medieval in origin and not associated with the mounds. They found the remains of Zibold's condenser, which they tidied up and examined closely. Zibold's condenser had apparently performed reasonably well, but in fact his exact results are not at all clear, and {{it is possible that the}} collector was intercepting fog, which added significantly to the yield. If Zibold's condenser worked at <b>all,</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> probably due to fact that a few stones near the surface of the mound were able to lose heat at night while being thermally isolated from the ground; however, it could never have produced the yield that Zibold envisaged.|$|E
5|$|On October 28, Persis Khambatta {{was hired}} to portray Ilia. She had been {{required}} to wear a bald cap for her screen test, although {{at this point the}} character also wore elaborate headgear in some footage. Roddenberry was insistent on this as a character attribute, but others such as Eisner hated the idea of a bald female character. His notes said that while a bald female character would be an interesting addition, it may prevent the audience from feeling at ease with Ilia and so the style may need to be given to a different character entirely. The auditions by this time were not held under the pretence that they were to play a part in a television series, but were openly talking about Star Trek becoming a feature film. The casting for Willard Decker had been delayed, both because of a slight delay in the production but also because the writers were no longer sure that the character was needed at <b>all.</b> <b>This</b> <b>was</b> despite auditions being conducted {{at the same time that}} Gautreaux was cast as Xon, during which, in his second audition with Barrett, he also read lines against ten actors competing for the role of Decker.|$|E

5|$|Poltava (renamed Frunze in 1926) was {{the second}} of the s of the Imperial Russian Navy built before World War I. The Ganguts were the first class of Russian dreadnoughts. She was named after the Russian victory over Charles XII of Sweden in the Battle of Poltava in 1709. She was {{completed}} during the winter of 1914–15, but was not ready for combat until mid-1915. Her role was to defend the mouth of the Gulf of Finland against the Germans, who never tried to enter, so she spent her time training and providing cover for mine laying operations. She was laid up in 1918 for lack of trained crew and suffered a devastating fire the following year that almost gutted her. Many proposals were made to reconstruct or modernize her in different ways for the next twenty years, but none were carried out. While <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> being discussed she served as source of spare parts for her sister ships and was used as a barracks ship. She was finally struck from the Navy List in 1940 and scrapping began at a very leisurely rate. She was intentionally grounded in late 1941 to prevent her from being sunk in some inconvenient location by the Germans. She was refloated in 1944 and scrapped beginning in 1949.|$|E
