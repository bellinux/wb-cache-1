40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the need to}} protect the legitimacy of decision-making process in investment arbitration through public access to the proceedings. Unlike commercial arbitration, investment arbitration entails decisions on state responsibility for measures directed towards protection of environment, lives and health of its population or human rights. Presence of the public interest in such disputes brings under strong criticism a traditional characteristic of arbitration process - its confidentiality. The problem of democratic deficit of decision-making can be resolved, inter alia, by allowing persons who are not parties to the dispute to participate in the proceedings if they consider that their interest might be affected <b>by</b> <b>arbitral</b> <b>award.</b> The 2006 Arbitration Rules of International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes envisage, subject to approval of the Tribunal, the right of a non-disputing party to file a written submission with the Tribunal regarding a factual or legal issue connected with {{the subject matter of the}} dispute. However, without right of those entities to attend arbitral hearings and, more importantly, without their access to documents submitted during the proceedings, this is not by far enough to give 'friends of the court' a meaningful and significant role...|$|R

Prior to taking into force of the Regulation of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Indonesia No. 1 of 1990 on Procedures for Enforcement of Foreign <b>Arbitral</b> <b>awards,</b> there were still constraints for the foreign business players in term of enforcement of <b>arbitral</b> <b>awards</b> in Indonesia. The Supreme Court as the highest judicial institution in Indonesia holds that international <b>arbitral</b> <b>awards</b> can not be enforced in Indonesia. After the Indonesian Supreme Court has issued such a regulation, enforcement of international <b>arbitral</b> <b>awards</b> in Indonesia began to be enforceable, because the procedural law that governs the procedures for execution of <b>arbitral</b> <b>awards</b> has been clear. In order to regulate better the international <b>arbitral</b> <b>award</b> problems in the hierarchy of legislation, on October 12, 1999, the Law on Arbitration and Alternative Dispute Resolution was promulgated.

40|$|The subject. This informational {{article is}} devoted to the peculiarities of {{recognition}} and enforcement of international commercial arbitration awards according to different countries’ legislation and international legal regulation. The purpose of the article is to identify legal patterns of recognition and enforcement of international commercial arbitration awards in different countries. Methodology. The study is based on comparative law and formal law methods, analysis and synthesis. Results, scope of application. Enforcement of <b>arbitral</b> <b>awards</b> in foreign countries is ensured and guaranteed by multilateral conventions, bilateral treaties and national legislation. The New York Convention 1958 in a certain way limits the scope of legal protection of <b>arbitral</b> <b>awards</b> and leaves the procedure for recognition and enforcement of <b>arbitral</b> <b>awards</b> for consideration of the state court. The author analyses of differentiation of the recognition and enforcement regime of so-called "domestic" and "foreign" solutions of international commercial arbitration in terms of doctrinal approaches and practice of foreign countries. Special attention is given to the analysis of foreign <b>arbitral</b> <b>awards</b> of recognition and enforcement procedures is given to a denial of recognition and enforcement of foreign <b>arbitral</b> <b>awards</b> and their reasons. In spite of the explicit grounds for refusal of recognition and enforcement of foreign <b>arbitral</b> <b>awards</b> in New York Convention 1958, some countries try to establish certain exceptions to the rule in the national legislation. Results may be applicable in improvement of international legal regulation. Conclusions. The courts of the countries – participants of the New York Convention 1958 cannot cancel the foreign <b>arbitral</b> <b>award</b> or revise it substantially. The refutation of this award is possible only in the court of the state in whose territory the relevant <b>arbitral</b> <b>award</b> was made, and such court is not formally bound by the rules of the New York Convention 1958, when deciding whether to cancel or modify the award. </p...|$|R

This paper goes a step further, and makes the case for a national law obligation to publish awards. It does so on the basis that there are significant public interests in the making available of certain information contained within arbitral awards; interests for which institutions have little or no incentive to provide. The paper uses New Zealand as an example, considering both the desirability of publication at the national level, and to the extent publication is desirable, how a mechanism to facilitate publication should be designed. It suggests a “statement of arbitral jurisprudence”, to be published annually by the Ministry of Justice, as the most appropriate way forward...|$|R

Furthermore, the so-called [...] "Just Ruling of Woodrow Wilson (the US President at that time)" [...] by the Treaty of Sèvres recognized an Armenian state much larger than the current Republic of Armenia by determining its Western borders in the Armenian Highlands and Asia Minor.

40|$|Securing a {{favourable}} {{award from}} a foreign or domestic arbitral court proves to be in many cases only half the battle. As a rule, Romanian law and courts acknowledge the final, binding and enforceable nature of arbitration awards and state the principle that arbitration awards shall be freely implemented by parties. However, there are instances where the unsuccessful party does not voluntarily perform the obligations arising from the <b>arbitral</b> <b>award.</b> In these cases, before incurring legal expenses on formal enforcement procedures, it is worth attempting several informal or indirect means of persuading the other party to honour its duties.

A cross-sectional, retrospective and non-experimental study design was adopted. The local arbitration cases registered at the High Court-Colombo during 2009 - 2012 for the setting aside or for the enforcement of the awards and the courts had completed the proceedings were selected as the convenient sample.

Chapter Two {{examines the}} attempts of the Contracting States adhering to the 1958 Convention and the extent of such attempts to cover its deficiencies, in particular the absence of the annulment grounds. Chapter Three mainly examines the effect of the absence of the annulment grounds, under the Convention, on the Contracting States' attempts, discussing, in particular, the grounds upon which the rendered <b>arbitral</b> <b>awards</b> can be annulled. In other words, this chapter examines whether the annulment grounds listed under the national arbitration laws are mandatory or have adequately covered the 1958 Convention's deficiency and thus cannot be waived or expanded either by the provisions of national arbitration laws or parties' agreements. Chapter Four concentrates on the academics' and national courts' approaches when recognition and enforcement of annulled foreign <b>arbitral</b> <b>awards</b> are sought. This determines the vital role of the deficiencies of the 1958 Convention and their effects on the national enforcement courts' decisions and on the extent of the discretion which they should exercise. This work concludes that the implementation of the enforcement refusal ground V (1) (e) is affected.
