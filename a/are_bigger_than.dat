25|$|The {{males have}} {{feathery}} antennae versus the thin antennae of females. Size differences are also noted, with the forewing {{of the male}} moth being 20–24mm long, {{and that of the}} female 31–35mm. Obviously, from this it is noticeable that the females <b>are</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> the males. Another important difference between the sexes is that females possess fully formed wings, but do not fly. Female flight is common in Eurasia and Asia, but these moths may be of a different species. The other species is called the Asian gypsy moth.|$|E

(3) Composite reliability (CR) refers to the consistency of the variables within the potential dimensions. The standard value shall <b>be</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> 0.6. The higher the CR value, the higher the consistency of the variables, meaning the better predictability. (4) Average variance extracted (AVE) refers to the average explanatory ability of the measurement variables within the potential dimensions.

2500|$|The {{abolition}} of some corporate bodies {{as part of}} successive local government reforms, beginning with the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840, has deprived some ancient cities of their status.

The name [...] "City" [...] does not, in itself, denote city status; it may be appended to place names for historic association (e.g. White City) or for marketing or disambiguation (e.g. Stratford City).

2500|$|In about 2 months, (early june) {{the first}} workers [...] emerge, {{attending}} to {{tasks such as}} maintaining the nest {{and taking care of}} the brood inside, or defending it if threatened. [...] The first workers take over all the duties in the colony, hunting for preys (larvae are fed with other insects that adults hunt) and collecting water, carbohydrates and nest material. The foundress is now a queen, that lays eggs and rests all day long while her workers do all the other work. More workers emerge, and the number of wasps soon increases. Newly hatched workers <b>are</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>than</b> the first ones, because they were well fed as larvae (unlike the first generation, reared solely by a single hard working wasp queen). In June and July, the colony grows and new cells are built. The nest can reach an extraordinary size for this genus, containing up to a couple thousand cells and a hundred of workers. But more often, this size is never reached. The time of development of brood contracts. The eggs laid in early July develop throughout a single month due to the warmer summer conditions and the increased availability of food, provided by an ever increasing amount of restless workers. Among those eggs, there are several unfertilized ones that the queen willingly chooses not to fertilize. Those eggs will mature in males, while the others develop in larger females that don't cooperate to the nest. Those are the future foundresses, that rapidly develop their ovaries and the amount of fat in their body. The reproductive phase happens when those females emerge, in late July or early August. Males generally emerge first, because their development requires a minor amount of time and food. Soon after August, the month of reproductive wasps rearing, worker numbers start dropping due to a decline in brood care as the older individuals start dying and replacements no longer exist. The initial foundress dies, while some workers start developing ovaries and laying eggs themselves. They are unfertilized, so their offspring will exclusively result in other males, if anything.|$|E
