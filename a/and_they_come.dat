25|$|The {{parable of}} the blind men and an {{elephant}} originated in ancient Indian subcontinent, from where it has widely diffused. It {{is a story of}} a group of blind men, who have never come across an elephant before, learn and conceptualize what the elephant is like by touching it. Each blind man feels {{a different part of the}} elephant body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the elephant based on their partial experience and their descriptions are in complete disagreement on what an elephant is. In some versions they come to suspect that the other person is dishonest <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> to blows. The moral of the parable is that humans have a tendency to project their partial experiences as the whole truth, ignore other people's partial experiences, and one should consider that one may be partially right and may have partial information.|$|E

Some, round whose neck big stones are tied, are drowned in deep water. Others again roll about in the Kadambavâlukâ (river) or in burning chaff, and are roasted in it. [...] <b>And</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> to the great impassable hell, full of agony, called Asûrya (i.e. where the sun does not shine), where there is great darkness, where fires, placed above, below, and all around, are blazing.

2500|$|Virginia's form of government, to {{be placed}} in its constitution, was a concern not only within its borders; Jefferson, in Philadelphia though he would have {{preferred}} to be in Williamsburg, sent a plan, and John Adams sent Henry a pamphlet containing his own views, to which Henry replied, [...] "your sentiments are precisely the same I have long since taken up, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> recommended by you". But it was Mason's plan for the government of Virginia which dominated, with a strong lower house of the legislature, {{to be known as the}} Virginia House of Delegates, and a weak executive, with the governor, elected by the two houses of the legislature, not even given the power to veto legislation. Henry opposed the weakness of the governor, feeling it was risky at a time of war to have the executive so weak, but his views did not prevail. He had reason to rue the office's lack of power, as on June 29, 1776, the convention, by 60 votes to 45 [...] for Thomas Nelson Jr., elected him as Virginia's first post-independence governor. The election of Henry, at that time Virginia's most popular politician, helped assure acceptance of the new authorities.|$|E
