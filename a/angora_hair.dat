50|$|<b>Angora</b> <b>hair</b> or Angora fibre {{refers to}} the downy coat {{produced}} by the Angora rabbit. While their names are similar, Angora fibre is distinct from mohair, which comes from the Angora goat. Angora fibre is also distinct from cashmere, which comes from the cashmere goat. Angora {{is known for its}} softness, thin fibres, and what knitters refer to as a halo (fluffiness). It is also known for its silky texture. It is much warmer and lighter than wool due to the hollow core of the angora fibre. It also gives them their characteristic floating feel.|$|E
5000|$|Bell goes on {{to detail}} the differences. Persian coats {{consists}} of a woolly under coat and a long, hairy outer coat.The coat loses all the thick underwool in the summer, and only the long hair remains. Hair on the shoulders and {{upper part of the}} hind legs is somewhat shorter. Conversely, the Angora has a very different coat which consists of long, soft hair, hanging in locks, [...] "inclining to a slight curl or wave on the under parts of the body." [...] The <b>Angora's</b> <b>hair</b> is much longer on the shoulders and hind legs than the Persian, which Bell considered a great improvement. However, Bell says the Angora [...] "fails to the Persian in head," [...] Angoras having a more wedge-shaped head and Persians having a more appealing round head.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Angora rabbit fiber, {{a luxury}} animal hair fiber is {{obtained}} from Angora rabbit. It has some distinct properties like warmness, fineness, whiteness and softness; however its utilization {{in the conventional}} textile clothing is restricted due to its scale structure and ladder type medulla. Medulla, an air occupied area {{in the middle of}} the fiber reduces the flexibility and scales are responsible for reducing inter-fiber cohesion during mechanical processing of hair. Due to these demerits, <b>Angora</b> rabbit <b>hair</b> is generally used to develop some specialty products through traditional hand spinning and hand loom. To utilize this hair with other textile fibers, either physical or chemical methods are used, that increase the value as well as performance of the final products. This paper overviews various novel approaches involved in finishing of <b>angora</b> rabbit <b>hair</b> for improvement of value and performance of products...|$|R
5000|$|International Angora Breeding Farm - The Farm {{is located}} 4 Km {{from the center}} of town. Though the area itself is grand and is {{surrounded}} by a forest on two sides, and the river Beas on the third, the front of the farm is easily accessible from India Highway 21. It was the first farm in Asia to have a complete cruelty free environment, which included the painless cutting of the <b>Angora</b> rabbit's <b>hair</b> for high-end luxury shawls and stoles. In 1976, this farm became the world's largest rabbit farm ...|$|R
60|$|The sturdy sons of this Karroo farmer had {{no light}} duty to perform each day. The farm was twenty miles in length, and of {{variable}} breadth. There were no crops raised on it, save {{the fruit of}} the splendid garden already mentioned, some grapes, and a few mealies. The sources of gain were ostriches and their feathers, <b>Angora</b> goat <b>hair,</b> (mohair), horses, sheep-wool, and cattle, looking after which kept father and sons pretty constantly in the saddle. It was a dashing style of life, requiring robust health and spirits. I have seen {{one or both of the}} boys return of an evening--after having been up at five or six, and out all day,-- scarce able to decide whether to eat or sleep! Counting and guarding the flocks formed a part of the duty.|$|R
5|$|Textiles {{from the}} most {{utilitarian}} to the most luxurious are made from animal fibres such as wool, camel <b>hair,</b> <b>angora,</b> cashmere, and mohair. Hunter-gatherers have used animal sinews as lashings and bindings. Leather from cattle, pigs and other species is widely used to make shoes, handbags, belts and many other items. Animals have been hunted and farmed for their fur, to make items such as coats and hats, again ranging from simply warm and practical to the most elegant and expensive.|$|R
50|$|A {{goatherd}} or goatherder is {{a person}} who herds goats as a vocational activity. It is similar to a shepherd who herds sheep. Goatherds are most commonly found in regions where goat populations are significant; for instance, in Africa and South Asia. Goats are typically bred as dairy or meat animals, with some breeds being shorn for wool. The top six goat industry groups in the United States include: meat (includes show), dairy (includes show, pygmy and Nigerian dwarf), fiber or <b>hair</b> (<b>angora,</b> cashmere), 4-H, industrial (weed control, hiking/pack), and biotech (see Goats in agriculture).|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{variations}} in chromosome Y are enabling researchers to identify paternal lineages, which are informative for introgressions and migrations. In this study, the male-specific region markers, sex-determining region-Y (SRY), amelogenin (AMELY) and zinc finger (ZFY) were analysed in seven Turkish native goat breeds, <b>Angora,</b> Kilis, <b>Hair,</b> Honamlı, Norduz, Gürcü and Abaza. A SNP in the ZFY gene defined a new haplotype Y 2 C. All domestic haplogroups originate from Capra aegagrus, while {{the finding of}} Y 1 A, Y 1 B, Y 2 A and Y 2 C in 32, 4, 126 and 2 Turkish domestic goats, respectively, appears to indicate a predomestic origin of the major haplotypes. The occurrence of four haplotypes in the Hair goat and, in contrast, a frequency of 96 % of Y 1 A in the Kilis breed illustrate that Y-chromosomal variants have a more breed-dependent distribution than mitochondrial or autosomal DNA. This probably reflects male founder effects, but a role in adaptation cannot be excluded...|$|R
50|$|Only {{certain types}} of fiber can be wet felted successfully. Most types of fleece, such as those taken from the alpaca or the Merino sheep, can be put through the wet felting process. One may also use mohair (goat), <b>angora</b> (rabbit), or <b>hair</b> from rodents such as beavers and muskrats. These types of fiber are covered in tiny scales, similar to the scales found on a strand of human hair. Heat, motion, and {{moisture}} of the fleece causes the scales to open, while agitating them causes them to latch onto each other, creating felt. There is an alternative theory that the fibers wind around each other during felting. Plant fibers and synthetic fibers will not wet felt.|$|R
40|$|It is a known {{fact that}} 35 million ton natural fibers, {{consisting}} of {{animal and plant}} fibers, are produced every year throughout the world. P lant fibers include cotton, linen, hemp, jute, ramie, sisal, coir while the animal fib ers include wool, silk, mohair, cashmere, <b>angora</b> rabbit <b>hair,</b> goat hair, vicuna fibers. In general terms, fibers are obtained from nine different animal types for commercial purposes. That their raw materials are not enough, they are grown in specific places, their manufac turing amount is low and they produce soft, elegant and bright fabrics, fibers such as angora, cashmere, alpac a, vicuna and camel hair is qui t e expensive and has very charming features. Because of all these reasons, these fibers are called luxur y fibers. A lthough luxur y fibers are protein - based, all of them display t heir own characteristics. This study aims to examine the physical and chemical distinguishing methods of luxur y fibers. In the analysis, their characteristic features the morphology of fibers, t heir thinness values, warm - keeping features, their resistance against chemicals are taken into consideration...|$|R
40|$|A {{screening}} of casein gene variability {{was carried out}} by Polymerase Chain Reaction – Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism in 8 goat breeds from Sudan (Nubian goat), Turkey (Angora Goat Lalahan Tiftic, <b>Angora</b> Goat Yerkoy, <b>Hair</b> goat) and India (Jammu, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, South Goat). A total of 16 different alleles or groups of alleles were found, showing conspicuous differences among breeds. The allele frequencies were submitted to cluster analysis in order to highlight differences between breeds, also including data from Red Sokoto, West African Dwarf Nigeria, West African Dwarf Cameroon, and Borno Goat. The tree obtained from the cluster analysis showed two main lineages. The West African goat clustered together, the Indian and Turkish breeds were in the other group. Nubian goat was found in an intermediate position...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the intra- and intergenetic diversities of eight different goat populations in Turkey including <b>Hair,</b> <b>Angora,</b> Kilis, Yayladag, Shami, Honamli, Saanen, and Alpine. A total of 244 DNA samples were genotyped using 11 microsatellites loci. The genetic differentiation between breeds was considerable as a result of the statistically significant (P 0. 05). Heterozygosity values ranged between 0. 62 and 0. 73. According to the structure and assignment test, Angora and Yayladag goats were assigned to the breed they belong to, while other breeds were assigned to two or more different groups. Because this study for the first time presented genetic data on the Yayladag goat, results of structure analysis and assigned test suggest that further analyses are needed using additional and different molecular markers...|$|R
50|$|Makeup for the {{character}} was designed by Steve Johnson. The Cat costume was made of <b>angora</b> and human <b>hair</b> and was fitted with a cooling system. To keep Myers cool during the outdoor shoots, a portable air conditioner was available that connected a hose to the suit between shots. The tail and ears were battery operated. The Fish was considered somewhat of a unique character for Rhythm & Hues (responsible {{for some of the}} effects and animation in such films as Cats & Dogs, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, and Scooby-Doo), in that {{the character}} had no shoulders, hips or legs, so all of the physical performance had to emit from the eyes, head and fin motion. Sean Hayes, who provided the voice for the Fish, found the role significantly different from his usual on-camera jobs; {{he did not know how}} the final animation would look, and all of his work took place alone in a sound booth.|$|R
40|$|Root-soil {{contact is}} an {{important}} factor for uptake of a less mobile soil nutrient such as phosphorus (P) by crop plants. Root hairs can substantially increase root-soil contact. Identification of crop cultivars with more and longer root hairs can, therefore, be useful for increasing P uptake in low input agriculture. We studied the root hairs of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cvs. Kosack, Foreman, Kraka) and barley cultivars (Hordeum vulgare L. cvs. Angora, Hamu, Alexis, Canut) in relation to P depletion from the rhizosphere in three soils of different P levels (0. 45, 1. 1 and 1. 6 mmoles P kg 1 soil; extracted with 0. 5 M NaHCO 3). Root hairs were measured in solution culture having nutrients and concentration similar to soil solution. Root hairs of Kraka were much longer (1. 27 0. 26 mm) and denser (38 3) hairs mm 1 root) than those of Kosack which had shorter (0. 49 0. 2 mm) and fewer (24 3) hairs mm 1 root) root hairs. Root hairs increased root surface area (RSA) of Kraka by 341 %. The increase with Foreman was 142 % and with Kosack it was 95 %. For winter barley, the length (1. 1 0. 3 mm) and density (30 1 hairs mm 1 root) of root hairs of Hamu differed from root hair length (0. 52 0. 18 mm) and density (27 1 hairs mm 1 root) of <b>Angora.</b> Root <b>hairs</b> of spring barley cultivars differed in length (Canut 1. 0 0. 24 mm; Alexis 0. 64 0. 19 mm) but not in density (Canut 31 1, Alexis 30 2 hairs mm 1 root). Root hair diameter (12 1 m) did not differ among the cultivars. Root hairs increased RSA of Canut by 245 %, Hamu by 237 %, Alexis by 143...|$|R
