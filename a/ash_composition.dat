40|$|The {{question}} of the composition variability frequently arises when evocating thetreatment or the eventual use of {{municipal solid waste incineration}} (MSWI) residues. This studyaims to estimate this assumed variability by following the composition of electrostaticprecipitator (ESP) fly ashes from MSWI day by day during one month. The samples compositionis determined by X-ray fluorescence and their mineralogy is analysed by X-ray diffraction. Theresults show that the concentration values of MSWI ESP fly ash elements remain in the range of 2 σ (standard deviation) around the average. An ANOVA test also indicates that there is nosignificant effect of the time-period on the ESP fly <b>ash</b> <b>composition.</b> The results suggest thus alow variability of the ESP fly <b>ash</b> <b>composition</b> over a one-month period.

The <b>ash</b> <b>composition</b> of the seaweed was found suitable for co-combustion with Miscanthus x giganteus, an energy crop high in alkali and silicon. Fuel mixtures were combusted in a bubbling fluidized bed reactor and ash samples were analyzed by SEM-EDS and XRD.

The fuel design approach was proven successful and the potential for using otherwise difficult seaweed fuels in synergetic co-combustion was demonstrated. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V.

30|$|We {{studied a}} series of Shinmoe-dake ash samples from the 2011 eruptive {{activity}} (January to August) and its precursory period (August 2008 to June 2010). Our focus here is not chemical characterization of juvenile material, which is separately reported in Suzuki et al. (2013). The data sets presented are component ratio, bulk <b>ash</b> <b>composition,</b> and particle size distribution. Bulk <b>ash</b> <b>composition</b> changes depend on proportions of ash constituents (Shimano et al., 2001), while particle size distribution sometimes can be an indicator of magma-water interaction (Morrissey et al., 2000). The data sets, such as presence and absence of juvenile material, morphology of juvenile material and particle size distribution, partly constrain some eruptive stages proposed in Nakada et al. (2013). Furthermore, we show that the bulk <b>ash</b> <b>composition</b> and free-crystal ash component change {{at the onset of}} magmatic eruption in January 2011, because of the contrast between newly erupting magma and past ejecta supplying accessory material. Although data sets presented in this paper are basic and partly preliminary (e.g. particle size distribution), the summary will be useful if Shinmoe-dake becomes active again. These data sets also form a basis for future advanced studies, as described above. At the end of this paper, we again emphasize the importance of continuous observation of ash samples, taking successful Shinmoe-dake case as an example.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the work was to evaluate differences in agglomeration characteristics between commercially available alternative bed materials and quartz-based bed materials, commonly used in fluidised bed combustion. Pure quartz bed materials. Magnesium oxide and foundry sand (natural sand with a clay coating) were used as alternative bed aterials. Carefully controlled bench-scale fluidised bed agglomeration experiments were performed, using calcium-rich bark and potassium-rich olive residue as model fuels with significantly different <b>ash</b> <b>compositions,</b> typical for forestry and griculture residues respectively. The resulting bed material particles and agglomerates were analysed with SEM/EDS. Analysis of bed material and agglomerates suggested that Mg and Al in the bed materials affect the agglomeration temperature positively for calcium-rich fuels. Al-rich foundry sand was found to decrease the agglomeration temperature in (Si, K) -rich systems. For combustion of olive residue in MgO bed, no attack layer was formed and agglomeration probably occurred via direct adhesion by partly melted alkali-silicates.

30|$|The August 2008 ash samples {{have higher}} SiO 2 {{contents}} than {{do most of}} the 2011 rock samples (equivalent to erupted magma) and past ejecta (Fig. 12). This indicates that the 2008 samples are not simple mixtures of 2011 ejecta and past ejecta. The compositional variation of the 2010 and 2011 ash samples can be approximated by a mixture of the above two major ash constituents (Fig. 12). The ash components derived from the past ejecta are “partly altered pumice + scoria”, “partly altered lava” and “altered material”, while those derived from the erupted magma in 2011 are “juvenile material” and “fresh lava”. Ash samples of post-January 19, 2011 eruptions have lower bulk SiO 2 contents than those of earlier eruptions (Fig. 11). Total ratios of “juvenile material” and “fresh lava” particles are higher in the post-January 19, 2011 eruptions (19.2 – 72.7 vol%), than in the earlier eruptions (0.4 – 12.6 vol%). The relationship can be explained by compositional differences between the erupted magma and past ejecta. As sμmmarized in Subsection 5.2, the averaged composition of the erupted magma is 57 – 58 wt% SiO 2 (Suzuki et al., 2013), whereas most past ejecta have 59 – 63 wt% SiO 2 (Tajima et al., 2013) (Fig. 12). The contribution of 1716 – 1717 pumice fragments (57 – 58 wt% SiO 2; Miyamoto, 2012) to 2010 to 2011 ash samples seems small, because particle ratios of “partly altered scoria and pumice” are much lower than that of “partly altered lava” (Fig. 2). We thus conclude that the decrease in bulk ash SiO 2 content {{at the start of the}} sub-Plinian eruption (Fig. 11) was produced by an increased contribution of 2011 magma to the ash (Fig. 14). This model is consistent with the bulk <b>ash</b> <b>compositions</b> of March 2010 and January 19, 2011, which are comparable to the most frequent compositions of past ejecta (59 – 63 wt% SiO 2) excluding the 1716 – 1717 pumice (Fig. 12). We infer that the uncatego-rized “lava” particles in the second phreatomagmatic stage (June to August 2011; Subsection 5.1. 2) consist of the same constituents as are in the vulcanian stage (i.e. “fresh lava” and “partly altered lava”), because of similar bulk <b>ash</b> <b>compositions</b> (Figs. 11 and 12) and similar juvenile material ratios (Fig. 2) between the two stages.|$|R
40|$|One {{target of}} any sludge {{disposal}} strategies {{is to develop}} an economy in closed loops. The usability of wastes has to be investigated. This paper is focusing on the reuse of sewage sludge ashes from mono-incinerators as raw material in the ceramic industry (brick and clay pipe manufacturing). At first, the chemical composition and the particle size distribution of sewage sludge ashes was investigated. The variations of these parameters of four sewage sludge incinerators were described within one year. Additionally {{the impact of the}} sewer system and wastewater treatment on the <b>ash</b> <b>composition</b> is presented. It was possible to simulate the mineralogical genesis of the sewage sludge ashes via firing trials. The physical impact of the ashes on the shaping, drying and firing properties and on the ceramic properties of the products became obvious. At last, the elution behaviour of the ash bricks has been described. The following results have been generated: The sewer system (combined or separated) influence the <b>ash</b> <b>composition</b> mainly. Having a combined sewer system, the collected silicate 'dilutes' the inorganic sludge components of the municipal wastewater. This can be shown by a linear dependency between the contents of SiO_ 2 and P_ 2 O 5. Furthermore, a dependency between the ignition loss of the primary sludge and the SiO_ 2 -content in the ash has been shown. It seems to be possible to predict the <b>ash</b> <b>composition</b> from operational data. The <b>ash</b> <b>composition</b> is influenced by the precipitation agents used for phosphorous elimination directly. Artificial and ash-typical minerals are generated during sludge incineration from the iron phosphates and aluminium phosphates in the sludge with participation of calcium carbonate. CO_ 2 -gas is then evaporating and makes the ash particles very porous. Therefore the calcium content of an ash is an indicator for its self-porosity. (orig.)

40|$|Abstract: Agglomeration {{occurring}} {{during the}} firing of phosphorus‐rich biomass is not fully understood. It has become clear that the ash‐forming matter in agricultural biomass (e. g., rapeseed cake) is phosphorus dominated and that phosphate species are involved in agglomeration. Understanding the agglomeration mechanisms would provide valuable insight into possible strategies for preventing defluidization. The objective of this work was to study the <b>ash</b> <b>composition</b> resulting from the combustion of a phosphorus‐rich fuel, in particular, the phosphorus compounds formed; the focus was the effect of <b>ash</b> <b>composition</b> on the formation of sticky ash particles, which cause defluidization. Eleven mixtures of rapeseed cake and bark with varying Ca/P molar ratio were studied. Using a 5 kW quartz BFB reactor operated at approximately 800 °C, eight‐hour combustion tests were performed prior to each agglomeration experiment. Fly ash and bottom ash samples were extensively analyzed with SEM/EDX, and the fuel properties were also determined. Rapeseed cake ash consists of particles containing different K/Na‐Ca/Mg‐P compounds. The <b>ash</b> <b>composition</b> responsible for low defluidization temperatures was found to lie {{in the region of}} the ternary diagram containing 30 ‐ 40 mol % P 2 O 5, 20 ‐ 40 mol % (CaO+MgO), and 30 ‐ 50 mol % (K 2 O+Na 2 O).

In the context of explosive eruptions where super-micron particles are plentiful, this result implies that volcanic clouds are IN-rich relative to meteorological clouds, which typically are IN-limited, and therefore should exhibit distinct microphysics.

The microalgae were grown under a range of culture conditions (41 and 601 laboratory culture, 3001 bag culture, and 80001 outdoor culture) and four light regimes (100 to 107 μ E m- 2 s- 1, 240 to 390 μ E m- 2 s- 1, 340 to 620 μ E m- 2 s- 1, and 1100 to 1200 μE m- 2 s- 1 respectively) {{to determine the effect}} of light intensity on the chemical composition of large scale outdoor cultures. Laboratory and bag cultures were axenic and cultured in Walne medium while outdoor cultures were grown in a commercial medium designed for optimum nutrition in tropical outdoor aquaculture operations. Change in growth medium and photon flux density produced only small changes in the proximate biochemical composition of both algae. N. oculata and Isochrysis sp. both showed a trend towards slightly lower carbohydrate and higher chlorophyll a in shaded outdoor culture. Isochrysis sp. showed significant concentrations of the essential polyunsaturated fatty acid 22 : 6 (n- 3) (docosahexaenoic acid) from 5. 3 to 10. 3...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{discusses}} the preparation and characterization of mullite based ceramics from bauxite-fly ash mixture. Two different varieties of bauxites viz. Bauxite 1 (B 1) and Bauxite 2 (B 2) were used, and each bauxite variety was mixed with different weight percent (30, 40, 50 and 70) of same fly ash (FA). The B 1 -FA compositions were processed through two stage firing, and the B 2 -FA mixture was processed through single stage firing schedule. Both the B 1 - FA and B 2 – FA compositions were sintered at 1400, 1450 and 1500 oC. The mullitization {{reaction in the}} bauxite-fly ash commenced with the dissolution quartz and corundum followed {{by the appearance of}} mullite and corundum. The fraction of quartz and alumina decreased from 900 oC onwards while that of mullite and glass increased. The mullite percentage in the sintered bauxite-fly ash samples was dependent on the bauxite type and the higher percentage of mullite in B 1 –FA compositions could be attributed to the finer crystallite size of B 1. No difference in the mullite percentage was observed between single stage and two stage firing schedule. High bauxite compositions had corundum and mullite, whereas, high fly <b>ash</b> <b>compositions</b> had cristobalite and mullite. The microstructure of the sintered B 1 -FA samples showed dense crystalline microstructure for 30...|$|R
