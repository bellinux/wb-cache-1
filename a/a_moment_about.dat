2500|$|A line L in 3-dimensional Euclidean {{space is}} {{determined}} by two distinct points that it contains, or by two distinct planes that contain it. Consider the first case, with points x= (x1,x2,x3) and y= (y1,y2,y3). The vector displacement from x to y is nonzero because the points are distinct, and represents {{the direction of the}} line. That is, every displacement between points on L is a scalar multiple of d= y−x. If a physical particle of unit mass were to move from x to y, it would have <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> the origin. The geometric equivalent is a vector whose direction is perpendicular to the plane containing L and the origin, and whose length equals twice the area of the triangle formed by the displacement and the origin. Treating the points as displacements from the origin, the moment is m= x×y, where [...] "×" [...] denotes the vector cross product. For a fixed line, L, the area of the triangle is proportional to the length of the segment between x and y, considered as the base of the triangle; it is not changed by sliding the base along the line, parallel to itself. By definition the moment vector is perpendicular to every displacement along the line, so d•m= 0, where [...] "•" [...] denotes the vector dot product.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Bounderby knew it {{was somewhere}} down town, but knew no more {{respecting}} it. So they stopped for <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> looking <b>about.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{hesitated for}} <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> {{introducing}} this remarkable ambassador into Lucilla's bedroom. One {{look at him}} decided me. After all, he was a doctor,--and such an ugly one! I took his arm.|$|E
60|$|Before I {{could answer}} she stood upon the threshold, I saw the {{delightful}} little smile fade {{from her lips}} as she looked in. She hesitated, and seemed for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> to retreat.|$|E

60|$|He beckoned to the maître d'hôtel {{and talked}} for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> the luncheon. Then {{he ordered a}} table for the next day, and {{slipping}} a louis into the man's hand, leaned over and whispered in his ear.|$|E
6000|$|Christina {{rose and}} moved for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> the room. Then turning suddenly, [...] "You don't believe in me!" [...] she cried; [...] "not a grain! I don't know what I {{would not give}} to force you to believe in me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} of all that, sir; but I don't see any reason why it shouldn't be done. I am quite sure, general, {{that if you had}} a brother a slave among the Arabs you would not {{hesitate}} <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> attempting it." ...|$|E

6000|$|He rose, {{and looked}} <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> him, {{as if trying}} to recall something.

6000|$|... 'How can you {{hesitate}} for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> this girl?' said Dare, {{pointing to}} the bent figure of the old man.

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Annerly, [...] "every day. For {{some time}} before his {{marriage}} I saw but little of him.

60|$|Lois {{opened the}} gate and stole into the lane with {{the air of a}} guilty child. She gave a little gasp as she {{came face to face with}} Saton, and picking up her skirts, seemed for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> to fly. He stood quite still--his face was sad--almost reproachful. She dropped her skirt and came slowly, doubtfully towards him.|$|E
60|$|He {{took the}} lamp {{from the table}} and crept upstairs. As he unbarred the door a smile of joy flitted across his strangely young-looking face and lingered for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> his lips. Yes, he would be good, and the hideous thing that he had hidden away would no longer be a terror to him. He felt as if the load had been lifted from him already.|$|E

60|$|They {{walked in}} silence {{along the narrow}} path. Soon they reached {{the edge of the}} river. A few steps further on was a seat, of which they took possession. In the {{distance}} the gondola, on fire now with lamps, was playing a waltz. A bat flew for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> their heads. Somewhere in the woods a long way down the river a nightingale was singing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; but I did {{not believe}} them, Chebron. Of course I did not for a moment--at least not for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>about</b> you.

But, oh, Chebron, surely it is not so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have already}} sent off ten others," [...] {{he said as}} he joined Chetwynd, [...] "to watch the lanes, and let no one go in or out.
