However, in models with monopolistic competition these are, in fact, not identical trade restrictions. This difference is not driven by tariff revenue but by how the two trade costs affect firm profits and the extensive margin. We illustrate these differences in a gravity model à la Chaney (2008).

40|$|Since firm {{heterogeneity}} {{has been}} introduced into international trade models, the importance of firm entry and exit (the extensive margin) has been highlighted. Thomas Chaney (2008) illustrates how accounting for heterogenous firms (and this extensive margin) alters the standard gravity equation. In particular, it reverses the previously predicted effect the elasticity of substitution has on the elasticity of trade flows. Further, Chaney shows that the elasticity of trade flows with respect to variable trade costs is a constant. As is common, iceberg transport costs are used as the variable trade barrier. However, in many empirical studies, <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> <b>tariffs</b> are also used {{as a form of}} trade barrier, which as Cole (2010) points out, is not isomorphic to iceberg transport cost in a monopolistically competitive setting. In this comment, I solve the Chaney (2008) model using <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> <b>tariffs</b> instead of iceberg transport costs and show the elasticity of trade flows with respect to tariffs is not constant, but depends on the elasticity of substitution.

5000|$|Mills {{had made}} the tariff his special study, and was long {{recognized}} as one of the leading authorities on the Democratic side. After the defeat of House Ways and Means Committee Chairman William Morrison in the 1886 election, Mills became the next chair of the U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means when the 50th Congress met. His selection, an historian of the tariff wrote later, [...] "was a red rag to the high protectionists, for Mr. Mills was an out-and-out free trader." [...] Debate over the tariff issue had been thrust upon the United States by President Grover Cleveland in his annual December message to Congress on December 6, 1887. [...] The President requested that Congress drastically reduce the tariff on many manufactured goods so as to promote trade and reduce the cost of living for ordinary United States citizens. [...] Indeed, Chairman Mills, using the Walker Tariff of 1846 as a guideline, had been drafting a bill since September 1887 which would address several of the proposals that Cleveland had included in his December message. As it turned out, most of his work went for naught. As he later explained, [...] "When I got to work with my brethren on the bill I found that it would not go, and I had to abandon my <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> <b>tariff</b> bill. The schoolmaster had not been sufficiently around, to bring our people back to the Democratic principle of taxation as to value." [...] This bill became known as the [...] "Mills Tariff Bill of 1888". [...] The Mills Bill was reported out of the Ways and Means Committee in April 1888. The bill provided for a reduction of the duties on sugar, earthenware, glassware, plate glass, woolen goods and other articles, the substitution of ad valorem for specific duties in many cases, and the placing of lumber (of certain kinds), hemp, wool, flax, borax, tin plates, salt and other articles on the free list. [...] The bill looked like it might split the Democratic Party. Just two years previously, the high tariff wing of the Democratic Party had been able to muster 35 votes in the House. [...] However, now the Mills Bill had become so highly partisan that when the bill was passed by the Democratic House on July 21, 1888, only four Democratic Congressmen voted against it. [...] The high tariff wing of the Democratic Party was largely wiped out by the passage of the Mills Bill of 1888.|$|E

To this end, we study a two-country, two-firm duopolistic trade model. We consider a product market in which a high-tech foreign firm can license its production technology to an importing country. The government of the importing country chooses an <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> <b>tariff</b> rate but has no commitment power. In our model, the home government raises the tariff rate as the licensed technology improves. Our two main results in the case that a highly productive technology is licensed are paradoxical: First, better technology is sold for a lower fee in a licensing contract. Second, the profits of both the licenser and licensee decrease as the licensed technology improves. In other words, cost reduction reduces the profits of both the licenser and licensee. These findings indicate that because of the role played by the <b>ad</b> <b>valorem</b> <b>tariff,</b> technology licensing does not always benefit both the licensee and the licenser.
