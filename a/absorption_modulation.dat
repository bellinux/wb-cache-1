40|$|A {{holographic}} {{kinetic model}} is proposed to quantitatively represent {{the dynamics of}} mixed volume gratings in a bulk gold nanoparticles (NPs) doped photopolymer. Due to the polymerization-driven multicomponent diffusion, the volume refractive index grating is induced by the periodic spatial distribution of photoproduct while the absorption grating is formed by the periodic spatial distribution of gold NPs. By simulating this model with the characterization of time varying <b>absorption</b> <b>modulation,</b> it is capable to describe the behavior of gold NPs in both the polymerization and the multicomponent diffusion process. The temporal evolution of refractive index modulation and <b>absorption</b> <b>modulation</b> can be extracted, respectively, from a diffraction efficiency curve by fitting the model.

40|$|Long-period (Pc 4 - 5) modulations of ionospheric {{cosmic noise}} {{absorption}} (CNA) at Siple, Antarctica (L= 4. 2) are rarely seen unaccompanied by pulsations {{in the local}} geomagnetic field. Conjugate modulations of ∿ 2 min period lasting about one hour were recorded near local noon by riometers at Siple and Roberval on October 30, 1983. The Siple magnetometer records show little evidence of pulsations at this time. The absence of a ground magnetic signature implies that if such events are caused by ULF hydromagnetic waves (e. g., a field line resonance), the waves are highly localized and effectively screened by the ionosphere. In addition, the possible existence of a recurrent particle precipitation structure in space was suggested by observations of <b>absorption</b> <b>modulations</b> with periods of 10 - 15 min which occurred on several days {{at about the same}} time of day.

Similar combinations of response time and modulation can be achieved using either ion species and various combinations of dose and annealing temperatures. Furthermore, it is shown that, in order to exploit the full capacity of this material, amorphisation during implantation should be avoided, and the samples should be annealed afterwards, leading to the predominance of point defects.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the formation of}} photoinduced gratings in a homeotropic film of nematic liquid crystal doped with methyl red. Using a grating translation technique, we determine the time evolution of the amplitudes and phase shifts of both index and <b>absorption</b> <b>modulations.</b> With low writing intensities, a fast grating caused by photoisomerization of the dye competes with a slower grating, originating from a reorientation of the director. This slower grating only appears if the light polarization has a nonzero projection on the director, i. e. at oblique incidence. The grating decays in the dark. We suggest that its formation {{may be explained by}} a light-induced dielectric torque, rather than a photorefractive effect. With high intensities, an even slower grating is formed at normal incidence. We stipulate that it originates from a change in the anchoring parameters caused by the adsorption of photoisomerized dyes on the surfaces. The resulting reorientation of the director is permanent. <br/...|$|R

The total amount of diffracted power and the diffraction efficiency versus the reading beam polarization has been measured by non-degenerated four waves mixing.
