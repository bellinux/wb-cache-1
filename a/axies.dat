IUE observations and archival data are used for the UV template spectra. The optical spectra are from ground-based observations obtained in apertures that match closely the 200 arcsec² IUE aperture. The templates of quiescent galaxies are built according to morphological type, elliptical, bulge, SO, Sa, Sb, and Se, and the templates of starburst gal­ <b>axies</b> according to color excess. The unprecedented characteristics of these templates is that UV and optical spectra have been obtained in matched apertures to produce consistent spectral information from 1200 to 10, 000 Å Despite the relatively small IUE aperture, the galaxy stellar populations are well represented in the elliptical, SO, Sa, and Se, and in the starburst templates. The spectra are available digitally. The UV-optical templates {{can be applied to the}} classification of high-redshift galaxies and to the iden­ tification of the host galaxies of quasars. The templates predict that observed magnitudes from traditional ground-based photometric surveys can be uniquely interpreted. For example, U, B, and I magnitudes uniquely determine both the redshift and the morphological type of a galaxy. The template spectra are also used to calculate K-corrections for galaxies as a function of morphological type and redshift, up to z = 2. These improved K-corrections are not sufficient to explain the excess counts in faint blue galaxies.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Substituted flavanoids {{interfere}} with uncoating of Enteroviruses including Sabin- 2 polio vaccine strains. However flavanoid resistant and dependent, type- 2 polio vaccine strains (minimally-diverged), emerged during in vitro infections. Between 1998 - 2009, highly-diverged (8 to > 15 %) type- 2, aVDPV(2) s, from two unrelated persistent infections were periodically isolated from Israeli sewage. AIM: To determine whether highly evolved aVDPV(2) s derived from persistent infections retained sensitivity to isoflavenes. METHODS: Sabin- 2 and ten aVDPV(2) isolates from two independent Israeli sources were titered on HEp 2 C {{cells in the}} presence and absence of 3 (2 H) - Isoflavene and 6 -chloro- 3 (2 H) -Isoflavene. Neurovirulence of nine aVDPV(2) s was measured in PVR-Tg- 21 transgenic mice. Differences were related to unique amino acid substitutions within capsid proteins. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The presence of either flavanoid inhibited viral titers of Sabin- 2 and nine of ten aVDPV(2) s by one to two log(10). The tenth aVDPV(2), which had unique amino acid substitution distant from the isoflavene-binding pocket but clustered at the three- and five-fold <b>axies</b> of symmetry between capsomeres, was unaffected by both flavanoids. Genotypic neurovirulence attenuation sites in the 5 'UTR and VP 1 reverted in all aVDPV(2) s and all reacquired a full neurovirulent phenotype except one with amino acid substitutions flanking the VP 1 site. CONCLUSION: Both isoflavenes worked equally well against Sabin 2 {{and most of the}} highly-diverged, Israeli, aVDPV(2) s isolates. Thus, functionality of the hydrophobic pocket may be unaffected by selective pressures exerted during persistent poliovirus infections. Amino acid substitutions at sites remote from the drug-binding pocket and adjacent to a neurovirulence attenuation site may influence flavanoid antiviral activity, and neurovirulence, respectively...|$|E

During hydrolysis, the nine-coordinate hydrated thorium(IV) ion is first transformed to a dimer, [Th₂(μ²-OH) ₂(H₂O) ₁₂]⁶⁺, then to a tetramer, [Th₄(μ²-OH) ₈(H₂O) ₁₆]⁸⁺, and finally to a hexamer, [Th₆(μ³-O₈) (H₂O) n]⁸⁺ with increasing pH and thorium(IV) concentration in an aqueous solution. Coordinated water looses the protons in two steps, first {{with the formation of}} the dimer and tetramer, and finally with the formation of the hexamer. Together thorium(IV) and iron(III) form a stable and highly soluble heteronuclear hydrolysis complex, [Th₂Fe₂(μ²-OH) ₈(H₂O) ₁₂]⁶⁺, in the pH range 2. 9 - 4. 8 and metal concentrations 0. 02 – 0. 4 mol·dm⁻³. In the same solutions at pH < 2. 9 two- or six-line ferrihydrite precipitates with time, while thorium(IV) remains in solution. Palladium(II) and platinum(II) hydrolyze very slowly in acidic aqueous solution and after 25 years of storage tiny oxide-like particles are formed at pH = 0. 7. The particle size has been estimated from the number of M···M distances in the formed particles and in the corresponding solid oxides from EXAFS studies. The palladium(II) and platinum(II) oxide particles grow along a or b <b>axies</b> and reach a size of 1 - 1. 5 nm³. These results have been supported by SAXS studies.

40|$|Abstract. The {{evolving}} {{galaxy is}} {{considered as a}} system of baryonic fragments embedded into the static dark nonbaryonic (DH) and baryonic (BH) halo and subjected to gravitational and viscous interactions. Though the chemical evolution of each fragment is treated {{in the frame of}} one – zone model with instantaneous recycling, the local gas density and, therefore, its star formation (SF) activity is influenced by other interacting fragments. In spite of its simplicity the model provides a realistic description of the process of galaxy formation and evolution over the Hubble timescale. 1 The model The Plummer – type (PLT) [2] halo is composed of DH and BH components. Their masses and softening parameters are correspondently equal to 1012 M⊙, 1011 M⊙, and 25 kpc, 15 kpc. The clumped baryonic matter (future galaxy disk and bulge) of mass 1011 M ⊙ is equally distributed among N = 2109 PLT particles with softening parameters 1 kpc. Initially particles are smoothly placed inside the sphere of radius 50 kpc, which rigidly rotate around z <b>axies</b> with initial angular velocity that provide rotational support of matter in its outer equatorial region. They are involved into the Hubble flow (H 0 = 75 km/s·Mpc − 1) and have random velocities 0 ÷ 10 km/sec. Their subsequent dynamics is defined by particle – halo and particle – particle gravitational interactions and by viscous BH influence and is followed by means of effective N – body integrator with individual time step. Gravitational terms are defined in a standard manner. The comparison of model results with data of more sophisticated V ISC SPH approaches shows that viscous acceleration term can be choosed as Ai = − Vi · | Vi | /RV ISC · ρBH(r) /ρV ISC · m gas /(mgas + mstar). Here ρBH is the i i i baryonic halo local density and Vi is a particle velocity vector. ρV ISC = 0. 2 cm− 3 and RV ISC = 10 kpc are model parameters. A particle mass is defined as a sum of gas m gas i and stellar mstar i components which depend on its evolutionary status. Initially mstar i = 0.

40|$|The {{observational}} {{selection bias}} {{properties of the}} large Mathewson-Ford-Buchhorn (MFB) sample of <b>axies</b> are demonstrated by showing that the apparent Hubble constant incorrectly increases outward when determined using Tully-Fisher (TF) photometric distances that are uncorreted for bias. It is further shown {{that the value of}} H(sub 0) so determined is also multivlaued at a given redshift when it is calculated by the TF method using galaxies with differenct line widths. The method of removing this unphysical contradiction is developed following the model of the bias set out in Paper II. The model developed further here shows that the appropriate TF magnitude of a galaxy that is drawn from a flux-limited catalog not only is a function of line width but, even in the most idealistic cases, requires a triple-entry correction depending on line width, apparent magnitude, and catalog limit. Using the distance-limited subset of the data, it is shown that the mean intrinsic dispersion of a bias-free TF relation is high. The dispersion depends on line width, decreasing from sigma(M) = 0. 7 mag for galaxies with rotational velocities less than 100 km s(exp- 1) to sigma(M) = 0. 4 mag for galaxies with rotational velocities greater than 250 km s(exp- 1). These dispersions are so large that the random errors of the bias-free TF distances are too gross to detect any peculiar motions of individual galaxies, but taken together the data show again the offset of 500 km s(exp- 1) fond both by Dressler & Faber and by MFB for galaxies {{in the direction of the}} putative Great Attractor but described now in a different way. The maximum amplitude of the bulk streaming motion at the Local Group is approximately 500 km s(exp- 1) but the perturbation dies out, approaching the Machian frame defined by the CMB at a distance of approximately 80 Mpc (v is approximately 4000 km s(exp - 1)). This decay to zero perturbation at v is approximately 4000 km s(exp - 1) argues against existing models with a single attraction at approximately 4500 km s(exp - 1) (the Great Attactor model) pulling the local region. Rather, the cause of the perturbation appears to be the well-known clumpy mass distribution within 4000 km s(exp - 1) in the busy directions of Hydra, Centaurus, Antila and Dorado, as postulated earlier (Tammann & Sandage 1985) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{various aspects}} of {{hospital}} environments {{have been shown to}} affect individuals psychologically and physiologically. One aspect of this, sound, has been thoroughly documented through acoustic measurements along with the potential adverse effects high sound level has on patients and nurses. Yet within hospitals, the character of the sound – the soundscape or the auditory landscape – is often overlooked in favour of this focus on sound level. This project has led to an improved understanding of the character and perception of hospital sounds using a triangulation of methods, with the intention of contributing to knowledge on how to improving the soundscape. Firstly, an interview study with patients and nurses within a cardiothoracic (CT) ward at a UK hospital was carried out to understand perceptions of, and thoughts towards, the soundscape. This {{led to the development of}} a conceptual model linking the relationships between various concepts and components of perception thereby mapping the perception of the soundscape and the feelings it evoked. A key aspect to perception – the notion of coping through habituating to sounds, became the foundation for subsequent work testing positive interventions. These complex feelings elicited by the soundscape were then reduced into a twodimensional perceptual space, extracted from a listening evaluation using Principal Component Analysis. Labelled ‘Relaxation’ and ‘Interest & Understanding’, these <b>axies</b> can represent the emotional-cognitive response stimulated by the CT ward sounds. Finally, potentially positive interventions were assessed using listening evaluations with participants rating additional natural and steady state sounds, along with a cognitive intervention of sound source information (SSI). It was found that the interventions resulted in a small (ƞ 2 = 0. 05) but significant effect (p=. 001) on the ‘Relaxation’ response. Natural sounds were most effective, with a less conclusive but still significant effect present for steady state sounds and SSI. The ‘Interest & Understanding’ dimension was non-significantly affected. Exploring this further, a between groups in-situ study assessed the benefit of SSI. The first group received SSI, the second received none. It was found that SSI had a small to medium significant effect (r= 0. 26 - 0. 31, p=<. 05) on ‘Interest & Understanding’ but not ‘Relaxation’. The project successfully developed a new way of assessing the perception of hospital sounds in a perceptual space. Using this approach it was concluded that natural sounds (here, the sounds of birdsong and a stream) provide a consistent way to improve the soundscape. However, a new approach of using SSI was successfully tested and was supported by a theoretical underpinning of cognitive reappraisal. Importantly, this offers an easier way to manipulate perception through potentially a reappraisal of the soundscape. Therefore, it was also concluded from the new findings and new theory that SSI could be used to create a positive response from people within hospital ward environments...|$|E
