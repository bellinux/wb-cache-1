5|$|Currency war, {{also known}} as {{competitive}} devaluations, is a condition in international affairs where countries seek to gain a trade advantage over other countries by causing the exchange rate of their currency to fall {{in relation to other}} currencies. As the exchange rate of a country's currency falls exports become more competitive in other countries, and imports into the country become more expensive. Both effects benefit the domestic industry, and thus employment, which receives a boost in demand from both domestic and foreign markets. However, the price increases for import goods (as well as in the cost of foreign travel) are unpopular as they harm citizens' purchasing power; and when <b>all</b> <b>countries</b> adopt a similar strategy, it can lead to a general decline in international trade, harming <b>all</b> <b>countries.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although {{regulation}} reducing lead {{in products}} has greatly reduced exposure {{in the developed}} world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products in many developing countries. In <b>all</b> <b>countries</b> that have banned leaded gasoline, average blood lead levels have fallen sharply. However, some developing countries still allow leaded gasoline, which is the primary source of lead exposure in most developing countries. Beyond exposure from gasoline, the frequent use of pesticides in developing countries adds a risk of lead exposure and subsequent poisoning. Poor children in developing countries are at especially high risk for lead poisoning. Of North American children, 7% have blood lead levels above 10 μg/dL, whereas among Central and South American children, the percentage is 33 to 34%. About one fifth of the world's disease burden from lead poisoning occurs in the Western Pacific, and another fifth is in Southeast Asia.|$|E
