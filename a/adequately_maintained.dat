5|$|On {{his return}} to Egypt, Puttick was offered the {{opportunity}} to become Chief of the General Staff, effectively the commander of the New Zealand Military Forces, by the visiting New Zealand prime minister, Peter Fraser. He accepted the role and returned to New Zealand in September 1941. Puttick's focus was on ensuring the manpower of the 2NZEF in North Africa was <b>adequately</b> <b>maintained</b> by reinforcements. In the face of the increasing threat of the Japanese Empire in the Pacific, he also put considerable effort into improving New Zealand's defences. After the Japanese entered the war, he considered the actual threat of invasion to be minimal but continued to encourage improvements in home defence as a means of boosting morale.|$|E
5|$|Under Henry II {{the castle}} was <b>adequately</b> <b>maintained,</b> but little {{additional}} work was undertaken to improve it. A castle-guard system was established, under which lands around Cambridge were granted to local lords {{on the condition}} that they provide guard forces for the castle, and the castle was primarily used to hold the sheriff's court and records. King John expanded the castle in the years before the First Barons' War of 1215 to 1217, but this work was concentrated on constructing a new hall and chamber, at the cost of £200. During the war, the rebel barons, supported by Prince Louis of France, captured much of eastern England; Cambridge Castle fell in 1216. The castle was returned to royal control after the war, but Henry III only conducted basic maintenance of the fortification. Cambridge was attacked again during the Second Barons' War in 1266. This time the town and castle held long enough to be relieved by Henry's forces, but the king reinforced the city defences with a large ditch, later known as King's Ditch.|$|E

50|$|Bushrod Washington did not inherit much {{cash and}} {{was unable to}} support the upkeep of the estate's mansion on the {{proceeds}} from the property and his Supreme Court salary. He sold some of his own slaves to gain working capital. However, the farms' low revenues left him short, and he was unable to <b>adequately</b> <b>maintain</b> the mansion.|$|R
500|$|Despite this, {{progress}} was {{not fast enough}} to suit the royal authorities. Richard II ordered the city to force workmen to repair the defences, and intervened in Canterbury's local elections in 1387 to ensure that two trusted bailiffs [...] Henry Lincoln and John Proude [...] were returned to office, {{in order for the}} King to have confidence in the walls being maintained. In 1403, Henry IV sent messages to the city complaining that the defences were not being <b>adequately</b> <b>maintained,</b> and that the city was still insecure.|$|E
500|$|The castle was {{neglected}} at {{the start}} of the 18th century, and a survey in 1715 reported that it was in a [...] "ruinous condition" [...] and that none of its artillery had been <b>adequately</b> <b>maintained.</b> A renewed threat from France prompted fresh work: in 1741, Lamberd's Bulwarke was strengthened, and in 1748 the government then renamed the bulwark the Grand Battery, transforming it into a two-tiered platform armed with twelve guns. The older parts of the castle were retained by the town and used primarily for accommodation and storage. The port of Dartmouth began to decline in importance, however, with nearby Plymouth taking over much of its former trade.|$|E
500|$|During the 1920s, the Joint Bridge Commission in Pennsylvania and New York started {{buying up}} the tolled bridges along the Delaware. The town of Lumberland offered the Pond Eddy {{bridge to the}} Commission, but was refused. The bridge, {{according}} to the Commission, was already toll-free and <b>adequately</b> <b>maintained.</b> However, the town was eager {{to get rid of}} the responsibility to maintain the two-decade old structure, and continued to try. Finally in 1926, the Lumberland town supervisor, a friend of Pennsylvania Governor Gifford Pinchot, offered the commission the bridge for $1; around the same time, the commission paid $55,000 ($ in [...] dollars) for the NarrowsburgDarbytown Bridge. The Joint Commission became the owner of both bridges. Since then the bridge's history has been virtually uneventful, surviving the flooding during the remains of Hurricane Diane in 1955 with little damage.|$|E

2500|$|Officer Candidate School {{was first}} {{proposed}} in June 1938, as the Army began expanding {{in anticipation of}} hostilities when a plan for an officer-training program was submitted to the Chief of Infantry by Brigadier General Asa L. Singleton, Commandant of the Infantry School. No action was taken until July 1940, however, when Brig. Gen. Courtney Hodges, Assistant Commandant of the Infantry School, presented a revised plan to (then) Brig. Gen. Omar Bradley, Commandant of the Infantry School. In July 1941, the OCS stood up as the Infantry, Field Artillery, and Coastal Artillery Officer Candidate Schools, each respectively located at Fort Benning, Fort Sill, and Fort Monroe, Virginia. [...] In addition to the aforementioned programs, there were Officer Candidate Schools stood up for other branches, in particular the Signal Corps at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. Due to the rapid creation of these programs because of wartime necessity, and then the rapid closures or restructuring soon {{after the end of}} the war, historical records were not always created or <b>adequately</b> <b>maintained</b> and little is known about some of these branch specific commissioning courses. The Signal Corps however has a full list of records going back to its very first class, which graduated 336 Officers on 30 September 1941. The records are maintained by the U.S. Army Signal Corps OCS Association, which is actively collecting and archiving the personal history of many of the over 27,000 Signal Corps OCS graduates that went through its WWII, Korean War and Vietnam War programs. The Signal Corps website includes a list of every U.S. Army Signal Corps OCS graduate, the date of their graduation, as well as all TAC Officers, training school CO's, and most enlisted men who served the Signal Corps' OCS training programs. In addition to the Signal Corps, several other units have alumni organizations that have maintained informal records and preserved documentation of the courses.|$|E
