500|$|Lyrically, Backspacer {{displays}} {{a more positive}} outlook than the band's last few albums. Vedder credited the election of President Barack Obama as inspiration for the optimistic lyrics. Regarding the lyrics, Vedder said, [...] "I've tried, over the years, to be hopeful in the lyrics, and I think that's going to be easier now." [...] Gossard stated, [...] "We've {{made a couple of}} political and pointed records, the last two in particular, and just to move away from that is great, because it allows you {{to go back to that}} when you need to and it refreshes everybody, and it comes down to a beat and a melody <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> and a lyric and a poem and something that's important to you." [...] Vedder stated he did not spend [...] "more than half hour" [...] writing the lyrics to each song: [...] "If it’s not gonna happen quick then I don’t wanna do it, because it means there’s another one out there that is gonna happen quick, and is gonna hit you like a lightning bolt." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead was {{the harshest}} on the game, which {{he gave the}} game 2/10, stating [...] "People don't live in movie studios. They live in houses and flats that are lit for comfort, not to fulfil the {{technical}} requirements of an ageing webcam. If {{you really want to}} put yourself <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> on the TV, leave this failed experiment on the shelf, and put the money towards a digital camcorder instead." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kate Buss and her friend, Marion Wright, were {{standing}} with their shipboard acquaintances Douglas Norman and Dr. Alfred Pain, watching the boats being lowered, when a call came for [...] "Any more ladies". The two men brought Buss and Wright to Boat 9, who beckoned Norman and Pain to join them. However, {{the men were}} barred from entering by crewmen on the deck. Horrified, Buss demanded to know why {{they had not been}} allowed aboard. Hames told her, [...] "The officer gave the order to lower away, and if I didn't do so he might shoot me, and simply put someone else in charge, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> would still not be allowed to come." [...] Norman and Pain both perished in the disaster. The boat was picked up by Carpathia several hours later, at about 6:15a.m.|$|E

2500|$|Barry Commoner {{has criticized}} Ehrlich's 1970 {{statement}} that [...] "When {{you reach a}} point where you realize further efforts will be futile, you may as well look after yourself <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> and enjoy what little time you have left. That point for me is 1972." [...] Gardner has criticized Ehrlich for endorsing the strategies proposed by William and Paul Paddock in their book Famine 1975!. They had proposed a system of [...] "triage" [...] that would end food aid to [...] "hopeless" [...] countries such as India and Egypt. In Population Bomb, Ehrlich suggests that [...] "there is no rational choice except to adopt some form of the Paddocks' strategy as far as food distribution is concerned." [...] Had this strategy been implemented for countries such as India and Egypt, which were reliant on food aid at that time, they would almost certainly have suffered famines. Instead, both Egypt and India have greatly increased their food production and now feed much larger populations without reliance on food aid.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 January 1896, in {{conversation}} with L. A. Tollemache, Gladstone explained that: [...] "I am not so much afraid of Democracy or of Science as of the love of money. This {{seems to me to}} be a growing evil. Also, there is a danger from the growth of that dreadful military spirit". On 13 January, Gladstone claimed he had strong Conservative instincts and that [...] "In all matters of custom and tradition, even the Tories look upon me as the chief Conservative that is". On 15 January Gladstone wrote to James Bryce, describing himself as [...] "a dead man, one fundamentally a Peel–Cobden man". In 1896, in his last noteworthy speech, he denounced Armenian massacres by Ottomans in a talk delivered at Liverpool. On 2 January 1897, Gladstone wrote to Francis Hirst on being unable to draft a preface to a book on liberalism: [...] "I venture on assuring you that I regard the design formed by you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends</b> with sincere interest, and in particular wish well to all the efforts you may make on behalf of individual freedom and independence as opposed to what is termed Collectivism".|$|E
2500|$|On 13 May 1938, {{while riding}} his {{motorcycle}} {{down the streets}} of Tokyo, a very intoxicated Sorge clashed into a wall and was badly injured. As Sorge was carrying around notes {{given to him by}} Ozaki at the time, had the police discovered the documents his cover would have been blown, but a member of his spy ring was able to get the hospital to remove the documents before the police arrived. In 1938, Sorge reported to Moscow that the Battle of Lake Khasan was due to over-zealous officers in the Kwantung Army and there were no plans in Tokyo for a general war with the Soviet Union. Unaware that Berzin had been shot as a [...] "Trotskyite" [...] in July 1938, Sorge sent him a letter in October 1938 reading: [...] "Dear Comrade! Don't worry about us. Although we are terribly tired and tense, nevertheless we are disciplined, obedient, decisive and devoted fellows who are ready to carry out the tasks connected with our great mission. I send sincere greetings to you <b>and</b> <b>your</b> <b>friends.</b> I request you to forward the attached letter and greetings to my wife. Please, take the time to see to her welfare". Sorge never learned that his friend Berzin had been shot as a traitor.|$|E
