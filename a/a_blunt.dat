5|$|Chantenay carrots. Although {{the roots}} are shorter than other cultivars, they have {{vigorous}} foliage and greater girth, being broad in {{the shoulders and}} tapering towards <b>a</b> <b>blunt,</b> rounded tip. They store well, have a pale-coloured core and are mostly used for processing. Cultivars include 'Carson Hybrid' and 'Red Cored Chantenay'.|$|E
5|$|The caps {{form from}} the top of the short stipe by the growth and {{expansion}} of <b>a</b> <b>blunt</b> margin and later as a thickening of the upper surface. Spines start to form when the cap hangs over the stipe slightly. They are white in many species, but become brown in maturity as the brown-colored spores accumulate on the surface.|$|E
5|$|Vertebral {{dissection}} {{may occur}} after physical {{trauma to the}} neck, such as <b>a</b> <b>blunt</b> injury (e.g. traffic collision), strangulation or manipulation, but may also happen spontaneously. 1–4% of spontaneous cases have a clear underlying connective tissue disorder affecting the blood vessels. Treatment is usually with either antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin or with anticoagulants such as heparin or warfarin.|$|E

5|$|All bovids {{have the}} similar basic form - a snout with <b>a</b> <b>blunt</b> end, {{one or more}} pairs of horns (generally present on males) {{immediately}} after the oval or pointed ears, a distinct neck and limbs, and a tail varying in length and bushiness among the species. Most bovids exhibit sexual dimorphism, with males usually larger as well as heavier than females. Sexual dimorphism is more prominent in medium- to large-sized bovids. All bovids have four toes on each foot – they walk on the central two (the hooves), while the outer two (the dewclaws) are much smaller and rarely touch the ground.|$|E
5|$|During the argument, {{a scuffle}} ensued between Pandey {{and the group}} of men. He was beaten, gagged and knocked {{unconscious}} with an iron rod. The men then dragged Jyoti {{to the rear of}} the bus, beating her with the rod and raping her while the bus driver continued to drive. Medical reports later said that she suffered serious injuries to her abdomen, intestines and genitals due to the assault, and doctors said that the damage indicated that <b>a</b> <b>blunt</b> object (suspected to be the iron rod) may have been used for penetration. That rod was later described by police as being a rusted, L-shaped implement of the type used as a wheel jack handle.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{realised}} that normal, globe-shaped hot {{air passenger}} balloons {{were subject to}} the whim of {{the direction of the}} winds. He then thought that perhaps a passenger balloon could be controlled somehow to move against the flow. His first step in an evolution to a controllable balloon was the design of a large elongated spindle instead of a sphere. His theory was that a symmetrical wave line spindle body would have less head resistance when passing through the air than did <b>a</b> <b>blunt</b> globe.|$|E
30|$|Bony lesions {{were present}} in 22 cases (78.6  %), a glenoid {{fracture}} was present in eight cases (36.4  %), a Hill–Sachs lesion was present in five shoulders (22.7  %), <b>a</b> <b>blunted</b> sign in five cases (22.7  %), and a Hill–Sachs lesion associated with a glenoid fracture or <b>a</b> <b>blunted</b> angle sign in two cases (9.1  %) and two cases (9.1  %), respectively.

5|$|The {{head has}} {{a less than}} {{triangular}} shape with <b>a</b> <b>blunt</b> and rounded snout. Still, the head is much wider than the neck. The rostral scale is small. The circumorbital ring consists of 10–16 scales. Across {{the top of the}} head, there are 7–11 interocular scales. 3–4 scales separate the suboculars and the supralabials. There are 12–17 supralabials and 13–17 sublabials. The first 3–4 sublabials contact the chin shields, of which there is only one pair. Often, there are two fangs on each maxilla and both can be functional.|$|E
5|$|The inquest into Sandra Rivett's death {{opened on}} 13November 1974 and {{was led by}} the Coroner for Inner West London, Gavin Thurston. Two {{witnesses}} were called to the courtroom, which was packed with reporters; Roger Rivett, who confirmed that he had identified his wife's body, and the pathologist, Keith Simpson, who confirmed that Rivett had died from being hit {{on the head with}} <b>a</b> <b>blunt</b> instrument. At Ranson's request, the hearing was then adjourned. Further adjournments were made on 11December 1974 and 10March 1975, before a full inquest was scheduled for 16June 1975.|$|E
5|$|All {{cetaceans}} are carnivorous and predatory. Toothed whales mostly feed on {{fish and}} cephalopods, followed by crustaceans and bivalves. Some may forage with {{other kinds of}} animals, such as other species of whales or certain species of pinnipeds. One common feeding method is herding, where a pod squeezes a school of fish into a small volume, known as a bait ball. Individual members then take turns plowing through the ball, feeding on the stunned fish. Coralling is a method where dolphins chase fish into shallow water to catch them more easily. Killer whales and bottlenose dolphins have also been known to drive their prey onto a beach to feed on it. Other whales with <b>a</b> <b>blunt</b> snout and reduced dentition rely on suction feeding. Though carnivorous, they house gut flora {{similar to that of}} terrestrial herbivores, probably a remnant of their herbivorous ancestry.|$|E

5|$|At a VCA {{meeting in}} April 1981, Loxton {{announced}} that he was severing all connections with organised cricket. He initially said that he was resigning for family reasons, as he would be moving to the Gold Coast in Queensland with his wife. However, he proceeded to give <b>a</b> <b>blunt</b> 15-minute speech, claiming that he had lost the art of communicating with the players and expressing his disenchantment with some aspects of the game, a reference to the declining player conduct. After relocating to the Gold Coast, he was unable to turn his back on cricket, and umpired matches at local level into his 70s. Although he became severely visually impaired, Loxton still attended matches and asked his companions to describe the proceedings for him; ever opinionated and blunt, he still offered advice to local cricketers.|$|E
5|$|Charlie Cutter first {{appears in}} Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. He {{is a friend}} of Nate's and is also shown to know Elena to some extent when she {{inquires}} about his well-being. It is apparent that he suffers from severe claustrophobia, requiring a lot of prompting just to squeeze through tight spaces. He is first introduced as one of Marlowe's henchmen, although it is soon apparent that he was an inside man. He helps Nate, Chloe, and Sully {{in the first part of}} the game with finding the clues to the location of Ubar, the Atlantis of the Sands. He gets injured when jumping off a tower in Syria and tells Nate to go on and stop Marlowe out of revenge. Despite looking like <b>a</b> <b>blunt,</b> common thug, he appears to be well educated, quoting John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men and correcting Sully's mistake when quoting Macbeth. He is voiced by and modeled after Graham McTavish, who previously voiced Lazarevic in the second game.|$|E
5|$|Heavily {{built and}} {{characteristically}} smooth, the pectoral fin disc of the short-tail stingray has a rather angular, rhomboid shape and is slightly wider than long. The leading {{margins of the}} disc are very gently convex, and converge on <b>a</b> <b>blunt,</b> broadly triangular snout. The eyes are small and immediately followed by much larger spiracles. The widely spaced nostrils are long and narrow; between them is a short, skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a fringed posterior margin. The modestly sized mouth has an evenly arched lower jaw, prominent grooves at the corners, and 5–7 papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor. Additional, tiny papillae are scattered on the nasal curtain and outside the lower jaw. The teeth are arranged with a quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces; each tooth is small and blunt, with a roughly diamond-shaped base. There are 45–55 tooth rows in either jaw. The pelvic fins are somewhat large and rounded at the tips.|$|E

5|$|Most {{terrestrial}} caecilians {{that lay}} eggs {{do so in}} burrows or moist places on land near bodies of water. The development of the young of Ichthyophis glutinosus, a species from Sri Lanka, has been much studied. The eel-like larvae hatch out of the eggs and {{make their way to}} water. They have three pairs of external red feathery gills, <b>a</b> <b>blunt</b> head with two rudimentary eyes, a lateral line system and a short tail with fins. They swim by undulating their body from side to side. They are mostly active at night, soon lose their gills and make sorties onto land. Metamorphosis is gradual. By the age of about ten months they have developed a pointed head with sensory tentacles near the mouth and lost their eyes, lateral line systems and tails. The skin thickens, embedded scales develop and the body divides into segments. By this time, the caecilian has constructed a burrow and is living on land.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of the}} Izak {{catshark}} is {{firm and}} stout, tapering dramatically towards the tail. The head is very short, wide, and flattened, with <b>a</b> <b>blunt</b> snout. The horizontally oval eyes are placed high {{on the head and}} have thick ridges beneath; each has a rudimentary nictitating membrane and is followed by a spiracle. The nostrils are preceded by triangular flaps of skin that almost reach the long, angular mouth. The mouth contains prominent papillae on both the roof and the floor, and lacks furrows at the corners. The upper and lower jaws contain on average 65 and 60 tooth rows respectively; each tooth is relatively large, with a narrow central cusp flanked by 1–2 smaller cusplets. There are five pairs of gill slits.|$|E
5|$|The dorsal and pelvic fins are angular, {{with the}} first dorsal fin larger than the second. The {{pectoral}} fins are narrow, pointed, and falcate (sickle-shaped); their shape separates this species from the similar-looking nurse shark. The origin of the first dorsal fin is about even with {{the origin of the}} pelvic fins, while the origin of the anal fin is even with or somewhat behind the origin of the second dorsal fin. The caudal fin has a shallow upper lobe and barely present lower lobe, comprising {{about a quarter of the}} total length in adults. The dermal denticles are diamond-shaped, bearing 45 faint ridges radiating from <b>a</b> <b>blunt</b> point. Tawny nurse sharks are yellowish, reddish, or grayish brown above and off-white below, and are capable of slowly changing their color to better blend with the environment. Young sharks have starkly white lower eyelids.|$|E

5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the thornback guitarfish is heart-shaped, slightly {{longer than it}} is wide, and thick towards the front. The snout is short and broad, with <b>a</b> <b>blunt</b> tip protruding slightly from the disc. The eyes are small and widely spaced; the spiracles are larger than the eyes and lie closely behind. The wide nostrils are preceded by moderately large, broad flaps of skin. The mouth is wide and gently arched; there are a pair of creases running from the mouth corners to the nostrils, enclosing a roughly trapezoidal area. The lower lip is inscribed by a deep furrow that wraps around the mouth corners. The small teeth have low crowns that may be sharp to blunt, and are arranged in 68–82 rows in the upper jaw and 64–78 rows in the lower jaw. The five pairs of gill slits are small and located beneath the disc.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocines have {{highly unusual}} teeth {{compared}} to other sauropods. The crowns are long and slender, and elliptical in cross-section, while the apex forms <b>a</b> <b>blunt,</b> triangular point. The most prominent wear facet is on the apex, though unlike all other wear patterns observed within sauropods, diplodocine wear patterns are on the labial (cheek) side of both {{the upper and lower}} teeth. What this means is that Diplodocus and other diplodocids had a radically different feeding mechanism than other sauropods. Unilateral branch stripping is the most likely feeding behavior of Diplodocus, as it explains the unusual wear patterns of the teeth (coming from tooth–food contact). In unilateral branch stripping, one tooth row would have been used to strip foliage from the stem, while the other would act as a guide and stabilizer. With the elongated preorbital (in front of the eyes) region of the skull, longer portions of stems could be stripped in a single action. Also, the palinal (backwards) motion of the lower jaws could have contributed two significant roles to feeding behaviour: 1) an increased gape, and 2) allowed fine adjustments of the relative positions of the tooth rows, creating a smooth stripping action.|$|E
5|$|In 1323, Roger Mortimer, who {{had been}} held in captivity in the Tower of London, escaped and fled to France. Two years later, Queen Isabella {{travelled}} to Paris on an embassy to the French king. Here, Isabella and Mortimer developed a plan to invade England and replace Edward II on the throne with his son, the young Prince Edward, {{who was in the}} company of Isabella. Isabella and Mortimer landed in England on 24 September 1326, and due to the virulent resentment against the Despenser regime, few came to the king's aid. Arundel initially escaped the invading force in the company of the king, but was later dispatched to his estates in Shropshire to gather troops. At Shrewsbury he was captured by his old enemy John Charlton of Powys, and brought to Queen Isabella at Hereford. On 17 November– the day after Edward II had been taken captive– Arundel was executed, allegedly on the instigation of Mortimer. According to a chronicle account, the use of <b>a</b> <b>blunt</b> sword was ordered, and the executioner needed 22 strokes to sever the earl's head from his body.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have an enhanced negative feedback sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system and <b>a</b> <b>blunted</b> ACTH response to corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). The effects of two dexamethasone dosages (0. 75 and 1. 5 mg) on the ACTH and cortisol concentrations after CRH stimulation (100 mu g) were studied in eight patients with PTSD and matched healthy control subjects. Compared to healthy subjects, patients with PTSD have <b>a</b> <b>blunted</b> ACTH response to CRH. Cortisol concentrations were only significantly influenced by dexamethasone dosage. Our results give further evidence for a central role of the pituitary in reflecting changes of the negative feedback sensitivity of the HPA system in patients with PTSD. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Background and aims: Obesity is {{associated}} with <b>a</b> <b>blunted</b> b-adrenoceptor-mediated lipolysis and fat oxidation. We investigated whether polymorphisms in codon 16, 27 and 164 of the b 2 -adrenoceptor gene (ADRB 2) and exon 10 of the G protein b 3 -subunit gene (GNB 3) are associated with alterations in in vivo lipolysis and fat oxidation. Design and methods: Sixty-five male and 43 female overweight and obese subjects (body mass index (BMI) range: 26. 1 – 48. 4 kg/m 2) were included. Energy expenditure (EE), respiratory quotient (RQ), circulating free fatty acid (FFA) and glycerol levels were determined after stepwise infusion of increasing doses of the non-selective b-agonist isoprenaline (ISO). Results: In women, the Arg 16 allele of the ADRB 2 gene was associated with <b>a</b> <b>blunted</b> increase in circulating FFA, glycerol and a decreased fat oxidation during ISO stimulation. In men, the Arg 16 allele {{was significantly associated with}} <b>a</b> <b>blunted</b> increase in FFA but not in glycerol or fat oxidation. Conclusion: These results suggest that genetic variation in the ADRB 2 gene {{is associated}} with disturbances in in vivo b-adrenoceptor-mediated lipolysis and fat oxidation during b-adrenergic stimulation in overweight and obese subjects; these effects are influenced by gene–gender interactions...|$|R
