5|$|<b>A</b> <b>somewhat</b> {{different}} {{design of}} cutting tool that can achieve the irregular hole or outer {{profile of a}} broach is called a rotary broach or wobble broach.

5|$|After {{weeks of}} exchanging taunts and each side {{predicting}} victory for their side, {{the two teams}} faced off at SummerSlam. Jesse Ventura had been appointed as a supposedly impartial guest referee by Jack Tunney. It was strongly hinted leading up the event that Ventura, who provided commentary for many WWF events and was a strong critic of Hulk Hogan but yet was a supporter of Randy Savage even (if only to <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> lesser extent) during his face days, had been paid an undisclosed amount by DiBiase.|$|E
5|$|As Waters' debut novel, Tipping the Velvet {{was highly}} {{acclaimed}} and {{was chosen by}} The New York Times and The Library Journal {{as one of the}} best books of 1998. Waters followed it with two other novels set in the Victorian era, both of which were also well received. Reviewers have offered the most praise for Tipping the Velvets use of humour, adventure, and sexual explicitness. The novel was adapted into <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> controversial three-part series of the same name produced and broadcast by the BBC in 2002 and a stage play in 2015.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of 1969, <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> {{recovered}} Barrett {{decided to return to}} his musical career and revisit the Jenner-produced recordings. He contacted EMI, and was passed on to Malcolm Jones, then-head of EMI's new prog rock label, Harvest. After both Jenner and Norman Smith, Pink Floyd's producer at the time, declined to work on the album, Jones agreed to take on the role.|$|E

Though he has an athletic build, his strength is far greater than what his frame would naturally allow. People guess him to be 155 pounds, but he actually weighs 211. During his stint as a sailor, he goes pearl diving with the natives of Cristobal {{and is able to}} dive deeper and stay under longer because of his density.|$|E
5|$|Eta Carinae B is {{a massive}} {{luminous}} hot star, about which little else is known. From certain high excitation spectral lines that {{ought not to be}} produced by the primary, Eta Carinae B is thought to be a young O-type star. Most authors suggest it is <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> evolved star such as a supergiant or giant, although a Wolf–Rayet star cannot be ruled out.|$|E
5|$|For the 1733 version, Bach used <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> more {{extended}} orchestra: the recorders {{are replaced}} by traversos (Fl) and they get separate parts in all four choral movements. In movements three and four the oboes {{are replaced by}} oboes d'amore (Oa). In the 10th movement (Suscepit Israel) the oboes replace the trumpet for the obbligato instrumental part.|$|E

5|$|In {{collections}} {{which contain}} fossils, high humidity can also affect pyrite (or its more reactive polymorph marcasite) (iron sulphide) fossils in <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> similar condition, {{which is known}} as pyrite disease. The iron sulfide can react with water and oxygen to form iron sulfates and sulfuric acid, which then can produce Bynesian decay.|$|E

5|$|Johnson's {{claim of}} tour harmony and player loyalty in 1948 {{was thrown into}} a {{different}} light by events less than four years later. The opening batsman Sid Barnes—a core member of the 1948 team—was seeking a return to Test cricket. Barnes was known for being <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> eccentric self-promoter. During the 1948 tour, Barnes organised a multitude of business deals while not playing cricket, and avoided paying customs duties on the enormous amount of goods he acquired in Britain by disembarking at Melbourne instead of Sydney.|$|E
5|$|Like mayflies, {{stoneflies}} and dragonflies, but to <b>a</b> <b>somewhat</b> lesser extent, caddisflies are {{an indicator}} of good water quality; they die out of streams with polluted waters. They {{are an important part}} of the food web, both larvae and adults being eaten by many fish. The newly hatched adult is particularly vulnerable as it struggles to the surface after emerging from the submerged pupa, and as it dries its wings. The fish find these new adults easy pickings, and fishing flies resembling them can be successful for anglers at the right time of year.|$|E
