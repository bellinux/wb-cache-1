5|$|A thunderstorm, {{also known}} as an {{electrical}} storm, lightning storm, or thundershower, is a storm characterized {{by the presence of}} lightning and its <b>acoustic</b> <b>effect</b> on the Earth's atmosphere, known as thunder. Thunderstorms occur in association with a type of cloud known as a cumulonimbus. They are usually accompanied by strong winds, heavy rain, and sometimes snow, sleet, hail, or, in contrast, no precipitation at all. Thunderstorms may line up in a series or become a rainband, known as a squall line. Strong or severe thunderstorms, known as supercells, rotate as do cyclones. While most thunderstorms move with the mean wind flow through the layer of the troposphere that they occupy, vertical wind shear sometimes causes a deviation in their course at a right angle to the wind shear direction.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{feature of}} ASHP {{external}} heat exchangers is {{their need to}} stop the fan {{from time to time}} for a period of several minutes in order to get rid of frost that accumulates in the outdoor unit in the heating mode. After that, the heat pump starts to work again. This part of the work cycle results in two sudden changes of the noise made by the fan. The <b>acoustic</b> <b>effect</b> of such disruption on neighbors is especially powerful in quiet environments where background nighttime noise may be as low as 0 to 10dBA. This is included in legislation in France. According to the French concept of noise nuisance, [...] "noise emergence" [...] is the difference between ambient noise including the disturbing noise, and ambient noise without the disturbing noise.|$|E

50|$|These {{distorting}} {{effects may}} be better mitigated by using another modulation scheme that {{takes advantage of the}} differential squaring device nature of the nonlinear <b>acoustic</b> <b>effect.</b> Modulation of the second integral of the square root of the desired baseband audio signal, without adding a DC offset, results in convolution in frequency of the modulated square-root spectra, half the bandwidth of the original signal, with itself due to the nonlinear channel effects. This convolution in frequency is a multiplication in time of the signal by itself, or a squaring. This again doubles the bandwidth of the spectra, reproducing the second time integral of the input audio spectra. The double integration corrects for the -ω² filtering characteristic associated with the nonlinear <b>acoustic</b> <b>effect.</b> This recovers the scaled original spectra at baseband.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} {{hypotheses}} on {{the cause of}} dissimilation. According to John Ohala, listeners are confused by sounds with long-distance acoustic effects. In the case of English , rhoticization spreads {{across much of the}} word: in rapid speech, many of the vowels may sound as if they had an r. It may be difficult to tell whether a word has one source of rhoticity or two. When there are two, a listener might wrongly interpret one as an <b>acoustic</b> <b>effect</b> of the other, and so mentally filter it out.|$|E

Ambiophonic could also mean the so-called concert hall sound in opposite to a surround sound with instruments all around the listener.

50|$|Pulpit is {{a raised}} stand for preachers in a Christian church. The {{origin of the}} word is the Latin pulpitum (platform or staging). The {{traditional}} pulpit is raised well above the surrounding floor for audibility and visibility, accessed by steps, with sides coming to about waist height. From the late medieval period onwards, pulpits have often had a canopy known as the sounding board or abat-voix above and sometimes also behind the speaker, normally in wood. Though sometimes highly decorated, this is not purely decorative, but can have a useful <b>acoustic</b> <b>effect</b> in projecting the preacher's voice to the congregation below. Most pulpits have one or more book-stands for the preacher to rest his or her bible, notes or texts upon.|$|E

In addition, this reconstruction method allows modeling the speech intelligibility after non-linear signal processing in the Speech Intelligibility Index.

His themes embrace all those that were current among Hebrew poets: panegyric odes, funeral odes, poems on the pleasures of life, gnomic epigrams, and riddles. He was also a prolific author of religious verse. As with all the Hebrew poets of his age, he strives for a strictly biblical diction, though he unavoidably falls into occasional calques from Arabic.
