5|$|After a premiering out of {{competition}} at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, U2 3D showed at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival and had its limited theatrical release in late January 2008, followed by its wide release the following month. The film was distributed by National Geographic Entertainment <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> released in IMAX 3D and digital 3D theaters. It peaked at number 19 at the United States box office, and earned over $26million worldwide, ranking {{as one of the}} highest-grossing concert films. It received widely positive reviews, with critics praising the 3D technology and innovation. U2 3D won several awards, and its reception convinced some of the creators that the project marked a paradigm shift in filmmaking.|$|E
5|$|After his much publicized {{problems}} on the base paths the previous season, Kemp arrived at spring training early to work with new Dodger coach Davey Lopes on his base running. Kemp announced his intention to steal 40 bases this season and Lopes hoped they would be high percentage steals. At {{the end of the}} season, Kemp had the 40 steals <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> caught 11 times, a significant improvement in percentage from the previous year, and his work with Lopes was credited for much of the improvement.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rest}} day came the race's {{individual}} time trial. It was won by Dumoulin, {{who was more}} than a minute ahead of all the other riders in the race. His time was good enough to put him into the overall race lead. Aru rode strongly, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> three seconds behind Dumoulin in the general classification after the stage. Rodríguez lost over three minutes to Dumoulin. Majka also lost significant time to Aru and Dumoulin and fell to fourth place.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the race, Rosberg's lead in the Drivers' Championship over Hamilton was reduced to a single point (168 to 167 points), with Räikkönen {{following}} in third with 106 points. Sebastian Vettel fell back to fifth with 98 points, two points behind Daniel Ricciardo. In the Constructors' standings, Mercedes extended its lead over Ferrari to 131 points, while Red Bull closed in on Ferrari <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> six points behind.|$|E
5|$|At {{the foot}} of the climb, the leading group only had a small {{advantage}} over the peloton and were soon caught. There were no lead-out trains in the final kilometres, with fewer than 60 riders left in the group. Tosh Van der Sande (Lotto-Soudal) was the first to sprint, but Kristian Sbaragli (MTN-Qhubeka) came past him and took the stage victory. Degenkolb was the quickest in the final metres, but he had been badly positioned <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> able to finish second. José Joaquín Rojas (Movistar) finished third. The stage was Sbaragli's first win in over two years. It was the second win of his career and the first in a Grand Tour.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{retained}} the same XI from the First Test at Trent Bridge. On the other hand, England made three changes; the leg spinner Wright had regained fitness and replaced {{the left arm}} orthodox of Young, all rounder Coxon made his Test debut in place of Barnett and Dollery replaced Hardstaff as the No. 5. batsman. Following his injury in the previous Test, Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> included after protesting to Bradman, who gambled on his inclusion. Australia won the toss and elected to bat. Miller played, but was unfit to bowl.|$|E

5|$|By 1927, {{the year}} of her 90th {{birthday}}, Cosima's health was failing. The birthday was marked in Bayreuth by the naming of a street in her honour, although she was unaware; the family thought that knowledge of the celebrations would overexcite her. In her last years she was virtually bedridden, became blind, <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> lucid at intervals. She died, aged 92, on 1 April 1930; after a funeral service at Wahnfried her body was taken to Coburg and cremated.|$|E

In her last book Rückerschöld {{repeated}} her previous stances {{about the importance of}} knowing household skills, and that girls should be allowed to partake in household work from an early age rather than being pampered and taught impractical skills. While stressing that a woman's God-given station was in the home and that she should be accustomed to humility and obedience, she also encouraged women to take matters in their own hands; the lack of household education could only be alleviated by sharing information and passing on knowledge {{from one generation to the}} other.|$|E

5|$|Examples {{of liquid}} {{crystals}} {{can also be}} found in the mineral world, most of them being lyotropics. The first discovered was Vanadium(V) oxide, by Zocher in 1925. Since then, few others have been discovered and studied in detail. The existence of a true nematic phase {{in the case of the}} smectite clays family was raised by Langmuir in 1938, but remained open for a very long time <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> solved recently. With the rapid development of nanosciences, and the synthesis of many new anisotropic nanoparticles, the number of such mineral liquid crystals is quickly increasing, with, for example, carbon nanotubes and graphene.|$|E
5|$|Her {{death was}} widely publicised shortly {{afterwards}} by the Polish press, which contributed to her growing fame. Plater {{became one of}} the symbols of the uprising. The symbol of the fighting girl became quite widespread both in Poland, Lithuania and abroad. Mickiewicz immortalized her in his poem, Śmierć pułkownika (Death of a Colonel), although the description of her death is a pure poetical fiction <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> loosely based on her real life. Mickiewicz has also idealized her personality and skills, portraying her as the ideal commander, worshiped by her soldiers. That poem has entered the elementary curriculum in the independent Poland.|$|E
5|$|In 1968 John Betjeman made a {{television}} film called A Poet Goes North {{in which he}} gave his opinion on the changing architecture of Leeds. Betjeman described the constant sound of falling Victorian architecture. Betjeman also lambasted British Railways House (now City House) saying it blocked all the light out to City Square <b>and</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> a testament to money and had no architectural merit of its own. Betjeman also praised Leeds Town Hall in the film. The film, which was never broadcast at the time, was preserved by Leeds Civic Trust and has been restored by the Yorkshire Film Archive. It was screened {{as part of the}} Leeds International Film Festival in 2008.|$|E
