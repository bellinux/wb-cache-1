40|$|The NO {{emission}} characteristics {{from both}} conventional and air-staged combustions of antibiotic mycelial residue were investigated in the temperature range of 1073 - 1273 K. The effect of hydrothermal treatment (HTT) prior to combustion on the NO emission was clarified. In conventional combustion, the NO emission from combustion of the hydrothermally pretreated antibiotic mycelial residue (HTT-AMR) was 20 - 30 % {{lower than that}} from combustion of the directly dried antibiotic mycelial residue (Dried-AMR). By <b>air-staged</b> <b>combustion,</b> the NO emission of HTT-AMR was reduced by about 45 % at 1273 K, compared to that by conventional combustion. As a result, the NO emission was largely reduced by 57 % by <b>air-staged</b> <b>combustion</b> of HTT-AMR at 1273 K in comparison with conventional combustion of Dried-AMR, showing a significant combining effect of HIT and <b>air-staged</b> <b>combustion</b> on the NO emission. Results of thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the AMR based fuels have only volatile matters which consist of light and heavy volatiles. Deconvoluting the NO emission curves demonstrated that the reduction in NO emission via HTT mainly resulted from {{the removal of the}} nitrogen in the light volatile as the form(s) of amino acid or/and ammonia, while the reduction via <b>air-staged</b> <b>combustion</b> was because <b>air-staged</b> <b>combustion</b> suppressed the formation of NO from the heavy volatile.

40|$|Because the <b>air-staged</b> <b>combustion</b> {{technology}} {{is one of}} the key technologies with low investment running costs and high emission reduction efficiency for the pulverized boiler, it is important to reveal the chemical reaction kinetics mechanism for developing various technologies of nitrogen oxide reduction emissions. At the present work, a three-dimensional mesh model of the large-scale four corner tangentially fired boiler furnace is established with the GAMBIT pre-processing of the FLUENT software. The partial turbulent premixed and diffusion flame was simulated for the <b>air-staged</b> <b>combustion</b> processing. Parameters distributions for the air-staged and no the air-staged were obtained, including in-furnace flow field, temperature field and nitrogen oxide concentration field. The results show that the air-staged has more regular velocity field, higher velocity of flue gas, higher turbulence intensity and more uniform temperature of flue gas. In addition, a lower negative pressure zone and lower O 2 concentration zone is formed in the main combustion zone, which is conducive to the NO of fuel type reduced to N 2, enhanced the effect of NOx reduction.

40|$|Abstract: Pulverized coal {{combustion}} {{is one of}} the main NOx emission sources. The existing low NOx combustion technology can not meet the requirements of environment conservation. In this paper, a new low NOx combustion technology, the NOx inhibition method based on water-gas reaction, is presented, in which steam is injected into the anoxic flame of pulverized coal to bring water-gas reaction and produce CO and H 2 which will inhibit the production of NOx. The produced H 2 is especially very active. Water-gas reaction is endothermic, which has an effect of reducing the peak temperature of the flame and is very propitious to the inhibition of thermal type NOx. As the water-gas reaction is also an interim process, the heat absorbed in it will be released when burning with oxygen so that the whole amount of heat inside the furnace is not affected. The principle of the method is proved correct by experiments and industrial scale of 420 t/h boiler tests in which the effect of NOx reduction is obvious. The technology is consistent with that of <b>air-staged</b> <b>combustion...</b>|$|E
40|$|Reduction of {{emissions}} of NO and N 2 O from co-combustion of wet or dried sewage sludge with coal or wood is investigated. This {{is motivated by}} the high nitrogen content in sewage sludge that may give rise to high emissions. An advanced <b>air-staging</b> method for <b>combustion</b> in circulating fluidised bed is applied. It is shown that with fluidised bed combustion the emissions are low {{as long as the}} sludge fraction is not too high (say, less than 25 %), and the conversion of fuel nitrogen to NO or N 2 O is only a few percent. However, air staging as such is not efficient for high volatile fuels, and any air supply method can be applied in such a case, in contrast to combustion of coal, when the air supply arrangement has a decisive influence...|$|R
40|$|In this study, Pakistan’s {{first and}} {{foremost}} pilot-scale combustion test results of Thar lignite Block- 8 have been reported. The reported data will be an addition to the existing literature on lignite firing testing. In this paper, NOx, CO, and CO 2 measurements were recorded at different axial locations in a down-fired combustion test facility for 2, 2. 3, and 2. 6 s of primary combustion zone residence times in a 4 m long down-fired pulverized fuel furnace. The overall NOx and SO 2 emissions have also been reported for unstaged and <b>air-staged</b> <b>combustion</b> conditions. The reported data (emissions and carbon burnouts) is for fuel/air stoichiometric ratios of 0. 9, 1. 01, and 1. 16 near the burner zone. The fly ash sample was analyzed, {{and the percentage of}} iron oxide was found in the range of 18 – 21 %, whereas the percentage of alumina concentration was in the range of 14 – 16 %, for varying stoichiometric ratios. Furthermore, slagging and fouling analyses have also been carried out on the collected ash samples during testin...|$|E
