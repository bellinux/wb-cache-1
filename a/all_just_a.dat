500|$|Bill Elson, an English support official, {{commented on}} the large {{swimming}} crowds [...] " [...] For many, {{this must have been}} a first introduction to swimming by the paralysed, and I felt that many were wondering whether paralysed persons could swim 50 metres– how many would fail to make the distance and it was <b>all</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> stunt to enlist their sympathies and raise money". [...] The crowd's thunderous applause made the official more comfortable about the event.|$|E

500|$|Lynch's {{performance}} as Sue attracted praise, with Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal and Liz Pardue of Zap2it both calling her portrayal Emmy-worthy. Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker called her [...] "the greatest Broadway-musical villain to ever co-star in a TV series", deeming [...] "Throwdown" [...] "possibly the best showcase yet for Jane Lynch", while Malcom praised {{the interaction between}} Lynch and Morrison, writing that their scenes [...] "crackled with electric wit". The pregnancy storyline drew criticism, with Tucker opining that it [...] "nearly derailed an otherwise-excellent episode" [...] and writing: [...] "there's {{got to be a}} better way to ground the series in a serious plot-line that doesn't make you wish the pregnancy plot was <b>all</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> non-musical dream sequence." [...] Malcom also criticized the storyline, asking if it could [...] "please just go away already?" [...] and writing that her patience with it was running out.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{it should}} be noted that Harvey tried to get Emily and the other Liars to leave Radley before Charlotte's {{explosion}} was scheduled to happen.

2500|$|Stevan Harnad is {{critical}} of speed and complexity replies when they stray beyond addressing our intuitions. He writes [...] "Some have made a cult of speed and timing, holding that, when accelerated to the right speed, the computational may make a phase transition into the mental. It should be clear {{that is not a}} counterargument but merely an ad hoc speculation (as is the view that it is <b>all</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> matter of ratcheting up to the right degree of 'complexity.')" ...|$|E

2500|$|Trinity's {{leaders had}} thus {{discovered}} {{the reasons for}} its decline in membership. [...] As a congregation, Trinity would thus need to inaugurate a [...] "shift" [...] in how it viewed both itself and its missionthey needed to let blacks know, both those inside and outside its walls, that Christianity was not at <b>all</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> religion for whites. [...] To begin this change, Sheares coined the motto [...] "Unashamedly Black and Unapologetically Christian". Contextualizing the motto, Speller, herself black, informs that shame about being black has been [...] "part {{and parcel of the}} black experience in America", and that blacks have historically hid their shame behind a variety of coping strategies and behaviors. Martin E. Marty, an emeritus professor of religious history, further explains, [...] "For Trinity, being 'unashamedly black' does not mean being 'anti-white.' [...] Think of the concept of 'unashamedly': tucked into it is the word 'shame'." [...] Underlying the idea, according to Marty, is a diagnosis [...] "of 'shame', 'being shamed', and 'being ashamed' as debilitating legacies of slavery and segregation in society and church." [...] Marty also explains that the Afrocentrism contained in the statement [...] "should not be more offensive than that synagogues should be 'Judeo-centric' or that Chicago's Irish parishes be 'Celtic-centric'." [...] Speller informs that the motto [...] "has remained as a reminder of not only who [...] are but Whose they are, continuing to emphasize both meaning and belonging".|$|E

50|$|But {{this changed}} when she meets Dr. Leandro Meneses (Luis Alandy). He was kind {{to her and}} she almost fell in love with him. He also taught her things about high society and etiquette. He then offered to do her plastic surgery. At first, she was {{hesitant}} but because of a problem with a gangster, she agreed. The operation was a success but when she looks at her reflection, she sees another face. She then realizes that this is <b>all</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> elaborate plot of another woman, her forgotten cousin, the supermodel Vanessa.|$|R
50|$|Osterman, in his director's statement, {{explained}} that, it was {{my intention}} to create a narrative that put the viewer in {{the seat of the}} experiment itself - one where the audience was never quite sure of who to trust and unsure if it was <b>all</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> elaborate ruse. The puzzle aspect of the movie will be challenging to some, but I wanted to echo Rod Serling and trust in the idea that it's okay for the audience to not have all the answers - to be comfortable with the unknown.|$|R
