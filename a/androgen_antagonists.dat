50|$|Antiandrogens, {{also known}} as <b>androgen</b> <b>antagonists</b> or {{testosterone}} blockers, are a class of drugs which prevent androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) from mediating their biological effects in the body.

Antiandrogens are one of three types of sex hormone antagonists, the others being antiestrogens and antiprogestogens.|$|E

Prohibitin is a potential tumor suppressor which was originally identified because of its anti-proliferative activities. Subsequent investigations led to the discovery of prohibitin mutations in sporadic breast cancers. Recent studies established that prohibitin directly regulates E 2 F-mediated transcription and growth suppression Prohibitin further attracted the attention of the translational cancer research community when it was recently connected to the regulation of estrogen receptor and androgen receptor activity. Prohibitin was shown to be required for the growth suppression of breast cancer cells induced by estrogen antagonists, and for therapeutic responses to <b>androgen</b> <b>antagonists</b> in prostate cancer. Through the application of new molecular technologies, additional novel functions of prohibitin have been revealed, demonstrating diverse and essential roles of this highly-conserved protein in regulating cell growth...|$|E

40|$|The human {{androgen}} receptor {{plays a major}} role in the development and progression of prostate cancer and represents a well-established drug target. All clinically approved <b>androgen</b> receptor <b>antagonists</b> possess similar chemical structures and exhibit the same mode of action on the {{androgen receptor}}. Although initially effective, resistance to these <b>androgen</b> receptor <b>antagonists</b> usually develops and the cancer quickly progresses to castration-resistant andmetastatic states. Yet even in these late-stage patients, the androgen receptor is critical for the progression of the disease. Thus, there is a continuing need for novel chemical classes of <b>androgen</b> receptor <b>antagonists</b> that could help overcome the problem of resistance. In this study, we implemented and used the synergetic combination of virtual and experi-mental screening to discover a number of new 10 -benzylidene- 10 H-anthracen- 9 -ones that not only effectively inhibit androgen receptor transcriptional activity, but also induce almost complete degradation of the androgen receptor. Of these 10 -benzylidene- 10 H-anthracen- 9 -one analogues, a lead compound (VPC- 3033) was identified that showed strong androgen displacement potency, effectively inhibited androgen receptor transcriptional activity, and possesses a profound ability to cause degradation of androgen receptor.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Prostate carcinomas are {{initially}} {{dependent on}} androgens, and castration or <b>androgen</b> <b>antagonists</b> inhibit their growth. After some time though, tumors become resistant and recur with a poor prognosis. The majority of resistant tumors still expresses a functional androgen receptor (AR), frequently amplified or mutated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To test {{the hypothesis that}} AR is not only expressed, but is still a key therapeutic target in advanced carcinomas, we injected siRNA targeting AR into mice bearing exponentially growing castration-resistant tumors. Quantification of siRNA into tumors and mouse tissues demonstrated their efficient uptake. This uptake silenced AR in the prostate, testes and tumors. AR silencing in tumors strongly inhibited their growth, and importantly, also markedly repressed the VEGF production and angiogenesis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that carcinomas resistant to hormonal manipulations still depend on {{the expression of the}} androgen receptor for their development in vivo. The siRNA-directed silencing of AR, which allows targeting overexpressed as well as mutated isoforms, triggers a strong antitumoral and antiangiogenic effect. siRNA-directed silencing of this key gene in advanced and resistant prostate tumors opens promising new therapeutic perspectives and tools...|$|E

Bicalutamide (BCLT) {{is a well-known}} non-steroidal antiandrogenic agent able to interfere with androgen receptor (AR). We tested the efficacy of BCLT in inhibiting proliferation of human PCa cell lines and of primary cultures from biopsies of PCa patients. Materials and Methods: Human prostatic carcinoma cell lines (PC 3, DU 145, LNCaP ALVA 31 and ND 1) and short-term primary tissue cultures from PCa patients were treated with BCLT. Cell proliferation and orange acridine and ethidium bromide fluorescence staining studies were performed. Results: BCLT was able to inhibit, significantly and dosedependently, {{cell proliferation}} in AR-positive human PCa cell lines and in 10 cases of primary cultures with Gleason grades 4 to 8.

40|$|Down-regulation of the {{androgen}} receptor (AR) is being evaluated {{as an effective}} therapy for the advanced stages of prostate cancer. We report that Ebp 1, a protein identified by its interactions with the ErbB 3 receptor, down-regulates expression of AR and AR-regulated genes in the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line. Using microarray analysis, we identified six endogenous AR target genes, including the AR itself, that are down-regulated by ebp 1 overexpression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Ebp 1 was recruited to the prostate-specific antigen gene promoter {{in response to the}} androgen antagonist bicalutamide, suggesting that Ebp 1 directly affected the expression of AR-regulated genes in response to <b>androgen</b> <b>antagonists.</b> Ebp 1 expression was reduced in cells that had become androgen-independent.

In OIL-treated rats the number and duration of crises were higher in females than in males. The administration of ICI or FLU resulted in hormonal effects in males and behavioral effects in females. In males ICI treatment increased estradiol plasma levels and FLU increased testosterone plasma levels; in females ICI and FLU treatments both decreased the number and duration of the ureteral crises.

40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} the second leading {{cause of cancer death}} in men in the US and Europe. The {{treatment}} of advanced-stage prostate cancer has been androgen deprivation. Medical castration leads to decreased production of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone by the testes, but adrenal glands and even prostate cancer tissue continue to produce androgens, which eventually leads to continued prostate cancer growth despite castrate level of androgens. This stage is known as castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which continues to be a challenge to treat. Addition of <b>androgen</b> <b>antagonists</b> to hormonal deprivation has been successful in lowering the prostate-specific antigen levels further, but has not actually translated into life-prolonging options. The results of several contemporary studies have continued to demonstrate activation of the androgen receptor as being the key factor in the continued growth of prostate cancer. Blockade of androgen production by nongonadal sources has led to clinical benefit in this setting. One such agent is abiraterone acetate, which significantly reduces androgen production by blocking the enzyme, cytochrome P 450 17 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP 17). This has provided physicians with another treatment option for patients with CRPC.

40|$|Polyglutamine tract {{expansion}} in androgen receptor is a recognized cause of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), an X-linked motor neuronopathy. Similar mutations {{have been identified}} in proteins associated with other neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have shown that amplified polyglutamine repeat stretches form cellular aggregates that may be markers for these neurodegenerative diseases. Here we describe conditions that lead to aggregate formation by androgen receptor with polyglutamine stretch amplification. In transfection experiments, the mutant, compared with the wild-type receptor, was delayed in its cytoplasmic–nuclear translocation and formed large cytoplasmic aggregates in the presence of androgen. The cytoplasmic environment appears crucial for this aggregation, since retention of both the wild-type and mutant receptors in this cellular compartment by the deletion of their nuclear localization signals resulted in massive aggregation. Conversely, rapid nuclear transport of both receptors brought about by deletion of their ligand binding domains did not result in aggregate formation. However, <b>androgen</b> <b>antagonists</b> that altered the conformation of the ligand binding domain and promoted varying rates of cytoplasmic–nuclear translocation all inhibited aggregate formation. This demonstrates that in addition to the cytoplasmic localization, a distinct contribution of the ligand binding domain of the receptor is necessary for the aggregation.
