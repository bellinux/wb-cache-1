The <b>class</b> 1 <b>applications</b> are generally rather tolerant of delays, for example, file downloading of remote MTC devices from MTC servers. The <b>class</b> 2 <b>applications</b> need their data to be served within a given delay constraint. The typical example of <b>class</b> 2 <b>application</b> is vehicle and asset tracking. Similar to class 2, the <b>class</b> 3 <b>applications</b> are usually delay sensitive, but most <b>applications</b> of <b>class</b> 3 can be made rather tolerant of occasional delay-bound violation and dropped packets. The <b>class</b> 4 <b>applications</b> adjust their transmission rates according to available radio resources while maintaining moderate delays.|$|R

40|$|Sensor {{networks}} {{have been identified}} as being useful in a variety of domains to include the battlefield and perimeter defense. We motivate the security problems that sensor networks face by developing a scenario representative of a large <b>application</b> <b>class</b> where these networks would be used in the future. We identify threats to this <b>application</b> <b>class</b> and propose a new lightweight security model that operates in the base station mode of sensor communication, where the security model is mindful of the resource constraints of sensor networks. Our <b>application</b> <b>class</b> requires mitigation against traffic analysis, hence we do not use any routing mechanisms, relying solely on broadcasts of end-to-end encrypted packets. Our model extends the broadcast range of the base station model by utilizing nodes adjacent to the base station as an intermediary hop. Additionally, our model detects and corrects some classes of aberrant node behavior. We have simulated our model and present simulation results. Ó 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Situation {{awareness}} {{is an important}} application category in cyber-physical systems, and distributed video-based surveillance is a good canonical example of this <b>application</b> <b>class.</b> Such <b>applications</b> are interactive, dynamic, stream-based, computationally demanding, and needing real-time or near real-time guarantees. A sense-process-actuate control loop characterizes the behavior of this <b>application</b> <b>class.</b> ASAP is a scalable distributed architecture for a multi-modal sensor network that caters {{to the needs of}} this <b>application</b> <b>class.</b> Features of this architecture include (a) generation of prioritization cues that allow the infrastructure to pay selective attention to data streams of interest; (b) virtual sensor abstraction that allows easy integration of multi-modal sensing capabilities; and (c) dynamic redirection of sensor sources to distributed resources to deal with sudden burstiness in the application. In both empirical and emulated experiments, ASAP shows that it scales up to a thousand of sensor nodes (comprised of high bandwidth cameras and low bandwidth RFID readers), significantly mitigates infrastructure and cognitive overload, and reduces false negatives and false positives due to its ability to integrate multi-modal sensing...|$|R

As an application framework, SAF is intended to simplify common application-building tasks, such as creating and configuring menus, toolbars, application window layout, and so on. SAF-based applications typically follow the model-view-controller design pattern {{with the addition of a}} class that mediates between various parts of the application. This mediator provides a link between the user interface and the application functionality triggered by the user. The Repast Simphony runtime interface implementation consists of three components: the user interface proper, the simulation engine infrastructure, and the <b>application</b> <b>class</b> that mediates the interaction between the two.

30|$|In {{the online}} {{classification}} phase, {{the distance between}} the spatial representation of a new flow and the centroid of all the clusters is computed. The flow is classified to the cluster with the minimum distance, hence to the dominant application class in the cluster. This approach achieves a classification accuracy exceeding 80 % with P= 5 and k= 50 for most <b>application</b> <b>classes.</b> However, if different <b>application</b> <b>classes</b> exhibit similar behavior during the application’s negotiation phase, their flows can be easily misclassified. For example, POP 3 is always misclassified as NNTP and SMTP, the dominant <b>application</b> <b>classes</b> in corresponding clusters. However, this issue can be resolved by leveraging port number as a feature during cluster composition [56], which increases the classification accuracy of POP 3 to over 90 %.|$|E

These subgraphs can be either dependent or independent for different <b>application</b> <b>classes.</b> In addition, clusters from different <b>application</b> <b>classes</b> exhibit repulsive/attractive relationships while they interconnect to form a mixed TAG. We then propose {{a variant of the}} Markov clustering algorithm to extract these clusters. Analysis of the clusters show that though mixed TAGs display similar structures, many core components are time/location specific. The clustering results also motivate us to develop an accurate, semi-supervised learning based traffic classification algorithm...|$|E
