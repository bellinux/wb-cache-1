5|$|One unusual {{defensive}} weapon was in use at Kenley on 18 August; the parachute-and-cable. Located {{on the north}} side of the airfield at 18 metre (60 foot) intervals, these were fired vertically by a rocket in salvoes of nine or more. As enemy aircraft came in at low-altitude, the parachute deployed and held a 145-metre (480 foot) long steel cable from an altitude of 180 metres (600 feet). If struck by an aircraft, a second parachute deployed <b>and</b> <b>tangled</b> the device around the victim. If the cable was picked up on the wing, there was a good chance that the aircraft would go down out of control. This device had not been used before 18 August 1940. Also available were barrage balloons with cutting cables capable of tearing off bombers' wings.|$|E

25|$|The {{chloroplast}} membranes sometimes protrude {{out into}} the cytoplasm, forming a stromule, or stroma-containing tubule. Stromules are very rare in chloroplasts, and are much more common in other plastids like chromoplasts and amyloplasts in petals and roots, respectively. They may exist to increase the chloroplast's surface area for cross-membrane transport, because they are often branched <b>and</b> <b>tangled</b> with the endoplasmic reticulum. When they were first observed in 1962, some plant biologists dismissed the structures as artifactual, claiming that stromules were just oddly shaped chloroplasts with constricted regions or dividing chloroplasts. However, {{there is a growing}} body of evidence that stromules are functional, integral features of plant cell plastids, not merely artifacts.|$|E

Ulm’s command element was located between the 2d and 1st Platoons.

The company employed patrols in a cloverleaf pattern as they. Two of these patterns had been completed by the time Company B progressed a little over one kilometer from its starting point.|$|E
25|$|The plot of Cecilia {{revolves}} around the heroine, Cecilia Beverley, whose inheritance from her uncle comes with the stipulation that she find a husband who will accept her name. Beset on all sides by would-be suitors, the beautiful and intelligent Cecilia's heart is captivated by a man whose family's pride in its birth and ancestry would forbid the only son-and-heir's change of name. This young man finally persuades Cecilia, against all her good judgement, to agree to marry him secretly, so that their union – and the consequent change of name – can {{be presented to the}} family as a fait accompli. The work received praise for the mature tone of its ironic third-person narration, but was viewed as less spontaneous than her first work, and weighed down by the author's self-conscious awareness of her audience. Some critics claim to have found the narration intrusive, while some of her friends found the writing too closely modelled on Johnson's.

40|$|AbstractThe neuropathological {{correlates}} of Alzheimer's disease (AD) include amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques <b>and</b> neurofibrillary <b>tangles.</b> To study {{the interaction between}} Aβ and tau and their effect on synaptic function, we derived a triple-transgenic model (3 ×Tg-AD) harboring PS 1 M 146 V, APPSwe, and tauP 301 L transgenes. Rather than crossing independent lines, we microinjected two transgenes into single-cell embryos from homozygous PS 1 M 146 V knockin mice, generating mice with the same genetic background. 3 ×Tg-AD mice progressively develop plaques <b>and</b> <b>tangles.</b> Synaptic dysfunction, including LTP deficits, manifests in an age-related manner, but before plaque <b>and</b> <b>tangle</b> pathology. Deficits in long-term synaptic plasticity correlate with the accumulation of intraneuronal Aβ. These studies suggest a novel pathogenic role for intraneuronal Aβ with regards to synaptic plasticity.

500|$|The Poitou donkey is [...] "instantly recognizable" [...] for {{a number}} of unusual {{characteristics}} that distinguish it from other donkeys. Its shaggy coat, called a cadanette, hangs in long cords when ungroomed because of the long, soft hair. Animals with great cadanettes of matted <b>and</b> <b>tangled</b> hair were most highly valued. A purebred Poitou has a more massive bone structure and a larger foot than a part-bred animal, but the shaggy coat is such a dominant trait that even a 1/8 Poitou donkey may resemble a pure-bred. In modern times, the coat is still considered important but less so than size and measurements. [...] Today, many Poitou donkeys are shorn for the purpose of hygiene, but some are allowed to grow their coats out so as to have [...] "bourailloux", or coats of great length. The coat is always dark brown or black. While lacking the stripes and cross-like markings on the coats of some other breeds of donkey, the Poitou should have a white underbelly, nose and rings around its eyes.|$|E
500|$|The British column {{arrived at}} the base of Arnold's {{barricade}} at the northern end of Ridgefield's town center sometime after noon. [...] Following an hour-long artillery barrage of the barricade, Tryon dispatched flanking parties to test both sides of the American position. Having anticipated this move, General Silliman posted forces at both flanks that blunted initial thrusts. Outnumbering the Patriot forces by more than three to one, Tryon chose to advance on all three fronts including a 600-man column under covering artillery fire against the barricade itself under the leadership of General Erskine. [...] Tryon directed General Agnew to send out flankers, whose enfilading fire helped breach the barricade. The British then pursued the Patriot forces in a running battle the length of Town Street, and gained control of the town. With 12 dead and 24 wounded, the Americans withdrew under General Arnold's orders.
