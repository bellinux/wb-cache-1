500|$|On 25 February, Yousafzai {{wrote on}} her blog {{that she and}} her classmates [...] "played a lot in class and enjoyed {{ourselves}} like we used to before". Attendance at Yousafzai's class was up to 19 of 27 pupils by 1 March, but the Taliban were still active in the area. Shelling continued, and relief goods meant for displaced people were looted. Only two days later, Yousafzai wrote that there was a skirmish between the military and Taliban, and the sounds of mortar shells could be heard: [...] "People are again scared that the peace may not last for long. Some people <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> peace agreement is not permanent, it is just a break in fighting." ...|$|E
60|$|Put {{into the}} plainest of prose, then, we <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{government}} of every country ought to supply work {{and pay for}} the unemployed, maintenance for the infirm and aged, and education and opportunity for the children. These are vast tasks. And they involve, of course, a financial burden not dreamed of before the war. But here again the war has taught us many things. It would have seemed inconceivable before, that {{a man of great}} wealth should give one-half of his income to the state. The financial burden of the war, as the full measure of it dawned upon our minds, seemed to betoken a universal bankruptcy. But the sequel is going to show that the finance of the war will prove to be a lesson in the finance of peace. The new burden has come to stay. No modern state can hope to survive unless it meets the kind of social claims {{on the part of the}} unemployed, the destitute and the children that have been described above. And it cannot do this unless it continues to use the terrific engine of taxation already fashioned in the war. Undoubtedly the progressive income tax and the tax on profits and taxation of inheritance must be maintained to an extent never dreamed of before.|$|E
60|$|Now {{the point}} is not only that this view of the Irish is false, but that it is the {{particular}} view that the Americans know to be false. While we <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Irish could not organise, the Americans are complaining, often very bitterly, of the power of Irish organisation. While we say that the Irishman could not rule himself, the Americans are saying, more or less humorously, that the Irishman rules them. A highly intelligent professor said to me in Boston, 'We have solved the Irish problem here; we have an entirely independent Irish Government.' While we are complaining, in an almost passionate manner, of the impotence of mere cliques of idealists and dreamers, they are complaining, often in a very indignant manner, of the power of great gangs of bosses and bullies. There are a great many Americans who pity the Irish, very naturally and very rightly, for the historic martyrdom which their patriotism has endured. But there are a great many Americans who do not pity the Irish in the least. They would be much more likely to pity the English; only this particular way of talking tends rather to make them despise the English. Thus both the friends of Ireland and the foes of Ireland tend to be the foes of England. We make one set of enemies by our action, and another by our apology.|$|E

6000|$|It will be {{said that}} the conduct of General Fremont during the days of his command in Missouri {{is not a matter of}} much moment to us in England; that it has been {{properly}} handled by the committee of Representatives appointed by the American Congress to inquire into the matter; and that after the publication of such a report by them, it is ungenerous in a writer from another nation to speak upon the subject. This would be so if the inquiries made by that committee and their report had resulted in any general condemnation of the men whose misdeeds and peculations have been exposed. This, however, is by no means the case. Those who were heretofore opposed to General Fremont on political principles are opposed to him still; but those who heretofore supported him are ready to support him again. He has not been placed beyond the pale of public favor by the record which has been made of his public misdeeds. He is decried by the Democrats because he is a Republican, and by the anti-abolitionists because he is an Abolitionist; but he is not decried because he has shown himself to be dishonest in the service of his government. He was dismissed from his command in the West, but men on his side of the question declare that he was so dismissed because his political opponents had prevailed. Now, at the moment that I am writing this, men <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> President must give him another command. He is still a major-general in the army of the States, and is as probable a candidate as any other that I could name for the next Presidency.* ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{group of}} 25 Greek lawyers {{initially}} threatened {{to file a}} lawsuit against both Stone and the Warner Bros film studio for what they claimed was an inaccurate portrayal of history. [...] "We are not saying that we are against gays," [...] said Yannis Varnakos, [...] "but we <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> production company should {{make it clear to}} the audience that this film is pure fiction and not a true depiction of the life of Alexander". After an advance screening of the film, the lawyers announced that they would not pursue such a course of action.|$|E

The French asserted that they could defend their border with Germany alone.Maurin said the British should [...] "understand that we can hold out alone if need be."In 1936 Maurin supported General Gamelin and told the Cabinet it was inconceivable that France could reverse German remilitarization without full mobilization.|$|E

50|$|I am leaving Paris, {{after eight}} fateful months, with {{conflicting}} emotions. Looking {{at the conference}} in retrospect, {{there is much to}} approve and yet much to regret. It is easy to say what should have been done, but more difficult to have found a way of doing it. To those who <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> treaty is bad and should never have been made and that it will involve Europe in infinite difficulties in its enforcement, I feel like admitting it. But I would also say in reply that empires cannot be shattered, and new states raised upon their ruins without disturbance. To create new boundaries is to create new troubles. The one follows the other. While I should have preferred a different peace, I doubt very much whether it could have been made, for the ingredients required for such a peace as I would have were lacking at Paris.|$|E
50|$|Since May 2006, {{more than}} 10,000 {{people in the}} Porong District have been {{displaced}} by the hot mud flowing from a natural gas well being drilled by Lapindo Brantas, an oil well company {{that is part of}} a conglomerate owned by Coordinating Minister for the People's Welfare Aburizal Bakrie. Gas and hot mud started spewing from the well on May 28, when the drill penetrated a layer of liquid sediment. Attempts to pump concrete down the well did not stop the flow. While some scientists have speculated that the earthquake that struck Yogyakarta on May 27, the day before the well erupted, may have cracked the ground, creating potential pathways for the mud to reach the surface, others have suggested that the drilling procedure was faulty by not using a casing. This is likely to be incorrect as technical papers on the subject showed that there were up to four sets of casing installed and cemented in the well. Some 50,000 cubic metres of hot mud were erupting every day as of August; in September, the amount increased to some 125,000 cubic metres daily. On September 26 barriers built to hold back the mud failed, resulting in the flooding of more villages. Gus Maksum, one of the thousands of Sidoarjo villagers displaced by the mud flow gives a detailed first-hand account of {{the first year of the}} disaster in his memoir Titanic Made By Lapindo. As of late September 2006 scientists <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> eruption may be a mud volcano forming, and may be impossible to stop.|$|E

5000|$|General Temmet Aelloon(Deceased) of the King's Legion is {{the first}} adversary the group has had to face. He wants the Sword of Truth as payment for a debt Benny owes him, and is hunting her relentlessly until she {{retrieves}} it for him. In his initial appearance, the then-Commander Aelloon was only shown to directly command a few men. [...] Later, he was shown to have control {{of a number of}} ships, dragons, and men. [...] Temmet has declared [...] "I am Legara." [...] on at least one occasion. This may be a reference to the phrase [...] "L'État, c'est moi," [...] which is attributed to Louis XIV of France. Even later, Aellon is promoted for [...] "subduing the east". Judging by his comments, the Lord Commander of the army that attacked the North is Aelloon's father. Later, a group of soldiers <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Commander was missing. It was speculated that Aelloon killed him, but later on, the Commander is revealed to have survived and defected from the Legion with a significant number of loyal soldiers at his side, and pledged himself to the service of Kethenecia. Due to an earlier attack on the Bloodrage tribe that left its leader, Chief Bloodrage, Krunch and Ray'd's father, killed, he was immediately met with hostility until Cale helped them get over their differences and work together in the battle against the Legion. In comic 694, he claims that Benny is the villain, and is trying to defend his empire from her.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{a part of}} Church {{teaching}} are {{the need}} for a special minister for the celebration of the Eucharist; and the lasting presence of Christ in the bread and the respect that should be shown to the bread. St. Ignatius of Antioch, ca. 110: [...] "Let that be considered a valid Eucharist which is celebrated by the bishop, or by one whom he appoints" [...] (Jurgens §65). From St. Cyril of Alexandria, ca. 440: [...] "I hear that they <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mystical blessing does not avail unto sanctification, if some of Eucharistic species be left over to another day. They are utterly mad who say these things; for Christ is not made different, nor is His holy body changed, but the power of the blessing and the life-giving grace is uninterrupted in Him" [...] (Jurgens §2139). And Tertullian, 211: [...] "We take anxious care lest something of our Cup or Bread should fall upon the ground" [...] (Jurgens §367). Pope Innocent III, 1208: [...] "However honest, religious, holy, and prudent anyone may be, he cannot nor ought he to consecrate the Eucharist nor to perform the sacrifice of the altar unless he be a priest, regularly ordained by a visible and perceptible bishop" [...] (Dz §424). The consecrated hosts are not merely changed permanently into Eucharist, but are due the worship of latria. In early counter-Reformation times, Pope Julius III wrote in 1551: [...] "There is, therefore, no room left for doubt that all the faithful of Christ in accordance with a custom always received in the Catholic Church offer in veneration the worship of latria which is due to the true God, to this most Holy Sacrament" [...] (Dz §878).|$|E

The full extent of the destruction remains unknown because government authorities and relief organizations continue to have difficulty accessing some remote locations.

40|$|Nowadays, “machine learning” {{is present}} in several aspects of the current world, {{internet}} advisors, advertisements and “smart” devices that {{seem to know what}} we need in a given moment. These are some examples of the problems solved by machine learning. This book presents the past, the present {{and the future of the}} different types of machine learning algorithms. At the beginning of the book, the author takes us to the first years of the computing science, where a programmer had to do absolutely everything by himself to make an algorithm do a certain task. As time passes, there appeared the first algorithms that were capable of programming themselves learning from the available data. The author presents what he himself calls the five “tribes” of machine learning, the essence that defends each one and the kind of problems that are able to solve without problems. With a great amount of simple examples, the author depicts which advantages and disadvantages of the “master” algorithms of each “tribes” <b>are,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> problem that a tribe solves perfectly well, another one cannot do it, and the other way about. The author suggests to get the best out of each “tribe” and make a unique learning algorithm able to learn without caring about the problem: the master algorithm...|$|E
40|$|Abstract / This article {{assesses the}} {{strategies}} of BBC News as it repositions itself for the digital future, explores how impartiality is being redefined, evaluates the impact of technology-led strat- egies on newsgathering and notes the tensions between rival forces inside the BBC. The corpora- tion is engaged in an internal upheaval of seismic proportions, as technological change accelerates and the largest ever round of job losses threatens. There is a titanic struggle between the technol- ogists h– who have been rebranded as über-divisional force Future Media and Technology – and the programme makers, who feel their role and resources have been cut {{to make way for}} the new platforms. In the FMT corner, its director Ashley Highfield is making apocalyptic announcements, characterized by BBC house newspaper Ariel as ‘Get web savvy or we die’, while programme exec- utives <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> BBC needs to recognize and protect its core strengths in content provision, not pretend it can compete with the cyber-cities of Google and co. It’s not future technology, it’s here and now, they say, but it should not be allowed to override the values and objectives of their public service remit. This article is based on research carried out for the ‘Spaces of the News’ research project, one of five strands of the Goldsmiths Media Research Programme, Spaces, Connectivity and Control, funded by theLeverhulme Trust, which is designed to evaluate the social impact of changes in communication technology.
