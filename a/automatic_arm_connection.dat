40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} {{agreement}} between conventional measurement of {{blood pressure and}} measurements obtained using two automated devices; and to compare how comfortable {{each of the three}} methods of measurement were for patients. METHODS: Blood pressure measurements and patient comfort scores were recorded using three different devices in 125 -surgery and 40 -community patients. The devices used were a conventional aneroid sphygmomanometer, an automated device that measured blood pressure on the upper arm and an automated device that measured blood pressure at the wrist. In each patient, the difference between the conventional and automatic measurement was calculated. The limits of agreement of each device were then calculated as the mean difference +/- 1. 96 standard deviations. RESULTS: In surgery patients, the width of limits of agreement of wrist measurement were 20. 0 mm Hg and 12. 1 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic blood pressure respectively, compared with 26. 4 mm Hg and 27. 7 mm Hg for <b>automatic</b> <b>arm</b> measurement. In community patients, the width of limits of agreement of wrist measurement were 11. 6 mm Hg and 11. 0 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic blood pressure respectively, compared with 19. 5 mm Hg and 12. 1 mm Hg for <b>automatic</b> <b>arm</b> measurement. Surgery patients also reported that wrist measurement of blood pressure was significantly more comfortable than either manual or <b>automatic</b> <b>arm</b> measurement (mean comfort scores 4. 03 for automatic wrist and 2. 13 for <b>automatic</b> <b>arm</b> measurement, Friedman's Test, P< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Blood pressure measurements taken using the wrist device agreed more closely with those obtained using a conventional aneroid sphygmomanometer than the arm device. The wrist device was also more comfortable for patients than two other methods of blood pressure measurement. Public Health (2000) 114, 165 - 16...|$|R

5|$|The MP 40 submachine {{guns are}} open-bolt, blowback-operated <b>automatic</b> <b>arms.</b> The only mode of fire was fully automatic, but the {{relatively}} low rate of fire enabled single shots with controlled trigger pulls. The bolt features a telescoping return spring guide {{which serves as a}} pneumatic recoil buffer. The cocking handle was permanently attached to the bolt on early MP 38s, but on late production MP 38s and MP 40s, the bolt handle was made as a separate part. It also served as a safety by pushing the head of handle into one of two separate notches above the main opening; this action locked the bolt either in the cocked (rear) or uncocked (forward) position. The absence of this feature on early MP 38s resulted in field expedients such as leather harnesses with a small loop, used to hold the bolt in forward position.|$|R

We cast the problem as a generic frame-by-frame random forest regres-sor without a strong spatial model. Our contributions are (i) a co-segmentation algorithm that automatically separates the signer from any signed TV broadcast using a generative layered model; (ii) a method of predicting joint positions given only the segmentation and a colour model using a random forest regressor; and (iii) demonstrating that the random forest can be trained from an existing semi-automatic, but computationally expensive, tracker. The method is applied to signing footage with changing background, challenging imaging conditions, and for different signers.

40|$|Abstract. Among {{the several}} {{issues related to}} {{real-time}} animation of virtual human actors, the ability to interact with virtual objects requires special attention. Take as example usual objects as: automatic doors, general furniture, or a lift. Interaction with such objects can easily become too complex for real-time applications. Some of the related problems involve: recognition of manipulation places, <b>automatic</b> <b>arm</b> and hand animation, and motion synchronization between actors and objects. The smart object approach is described here and can overcome many of these difficulties by storing all needed interaction information within the object description. Interaction information is defined during modeling phase, forming a complete “user guide ” of the object. In this way, virtual actors can simply access and follow such interaction descriptions {{in order to accomplish}} some given task. Solutions to related sub-problems such as programming object’s behaviors, interactions with multiple actors, or actor animation to manipulate objects are discussed here, and detailed case studies are analyzed. Computer graphics systems are no longer synonym of a static scene showing 3 D objects. I...|$|R

In the experiments described tactile feedback was investigated by incorporating a touch sensing and touch display system into a teleoperator, while the levels of automatic control were investigated by incorporating supervisory control features in the teleoperator control system. In particular, a hand contact system which senses and reproduces to the operator the contact between the end-effector and the object being touched or manipulated is described, {{as well as a}} jaw contact system which senses and reproduces to the operator the shape and location of the object held in the remote jaws, and an arm control system consisting of a control station where the operator controls the motion of the arm by transmitting commands, a remote station that accepts the commands and uses them, and a communications link that limits information flow. In addition, an algorithmic language for remote manipulation is described, and the desired features that an <b>automatic</b> <b>arm</b> controller should possess are reviewed...|$|R
50|$|In a {{situational}} crisis, {{the men of}} the 1st Parachute Chasseur Regiment {{are known}} to always interpose between belligerents and protect civilians at all cost. Dedicated to such a mission, the regiment sometimes pays the price heavily in losses. Ten year later in June 1993, two combat companies of the 1er RCP land at the aerodrome of Phnom Penh, in the greater west of Cambodia. Whether on Patrols in search for opposing rebel groups, or escorting the convoys of the United Nations and Non-governmental organization; the missions of the regiment took place in a tense climate with the Khmer Rouge.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} detection, tracking and recognition of lower arm and hand movements from color video sequences using a linguistic approach driven by motion analysis and clustering techniques. The novelty of our method comes from (i) <b>automatic</b> <b>arm</b> detection, without any manual initialization, foreground or background modeling, (ii) gesture representation {{at different levels of}} abstraction using a linguistic approach based upon signal to symbolic mappings, and (iii) robust matching for gesture recognition using the weighted largest common sequence (of symbols). Learning Vector Quantization abstracts the affine motion parameters as morphological primitive units, i. e., ”letters”, clustering techniques derive sequence of letters as ”words ” for both subactivities and the transition occurring between them, and finally the arm activities are recognized in terms of sequences of some subactivities. Using activity cycles from six kinds of arm movements, e. g., (slow and fast pounding), striking, swing, swirl, and stirring, which were not available during training, the performance achieved is perfect- 100 %- if one allows, as it should be the case for invariance purposes, to recognize slow and fast pounding video sequences as one and the same type of activity...|$|R
