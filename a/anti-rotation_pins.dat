40|$|Generally {{the point}} about which tilt takes place and motion is transmitted, in a basic sense, {{represents}} a joint (e. g., Cardan suspension, Hooke joint, or a constant velocity joints). However, the locking devices mentioned above {{are only a few}} out of the numerous mechanisms that fulfill the same or similar function. Instead of pins there can bellows, or O-rings that support the flexibly mounted element in a seal. Likewise, welding, bolts, or press-fits are also used to attach rotors to rotating shafts. Since <b>anti-rotation</b> <b>pins</b> allow free rotation (tilt motion) only in a prescribed order they are not axisymmetric joints. On the other hand bellows, O-rings, welds, and press fits do not impose any preferential order on rotations and can be (a) 3 D view (b) 2 D cross-section Fig. 1 : A kinematical model for a seal wobbling element System XYZ is either fixed in space (flexibly mounted stator, FMS) or is rotating (flexibly mounted rotor, FMR) with the shaft having a velocity about Z. It is then further assumed that const (for FMR) or 0 (for FMS). System xyz is whirling (wobbling) within XYZ such that x is the axis about which the nutation (tilt) occurs, z is the out-normal axis about which the spin takes place, and y points toward the point of maximum separation between planes containing XY and xy...|$|E
40|$|Issues {{that had}} been {{encountered}} during proximal femoral fracture fixation using proximal femoral nail include i) {{the adequacy of the}} femoral neck width in the local population and ii) the potential difficulty encountered during fixation in certain prefixed angles as determined by the implant. This was a retrospective, descriptive study evaluating the anterior-posterior pelvic radiographs of 100 consecutive patients, from January to August 2007, managed at University Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur. The femoral neck width in the population studied was adequate for placement of femoral neck screw and <b>anti-rotation</b> <b>pin</b> or hip pin using the proximal femoral nail implant. (mean = 34. 0 ± 3. 7 mm, min = 24. 6 mm). There {{was no significant difference between}} the working area using an implant angled at 130 ° or 135 ° (P= 0. 91). Both femoral neck width and neck shaft angle of the Malaysian population studied were not a factor influencing the placement of femoral neck lag screws and <b>anti-rotation</b> <b>pin...</b>|$|R
50|$|A single {{compression}} seal fitting may seal {{on a single}} or multiple elements. Sealing glands designed to seal on single elements consist of a body, cap, sealant and follower. When sealing on multiple elements, gland designs also include a seat and an <b>anti-rotation</b> <b>pin</b> to prevent wires or conductors from twisting and shearing. One or more insulators may also be included when electrical isolation is required.|$|R
40|$|The {{treatment}} of choice for early mobilization of hip fracture is surgery, which traditionally employs side plates and screws or intramedullary nails. We examined the biomechanical properties of a new proximal femoral nail system. The new expandable Fixion proximal femur nailing (PFN) system, made of stainless-steel alloy, consists of a nail, a peg and an <b>anti-rotation</b> <b>pin.</b> Upon positioning, the nail and peg are expanded to their maximal diameter. The current biomechanical study investigated: nail bending strength and stiffness, fatigue properties and hip peg strength. A cadaveric study that determined {{the effect of the}} expandable peg on the femoral head included subsidence testing, pull and torsion testing and intra-osseous pressure (IOP) measurements before and after expansion. Biomechanical properties of the new nail met ASTM F 384 guideline requirements. The cadaver study yielded equivalent results for the pullout test between the peg and the hip screw, but found the peg superior in the torsion strength test. IOP during peg insertion and expansion was substantially lower than the threshold pressure that causes avascular necrosis. The biomechanical tests found the new system to be safe and able to provide good abutment of the nail to the bone. We conclude that the Fixion PFN system proved to be an effective proximal femur fracture fixation device...|$|R
