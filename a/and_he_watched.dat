500|$|In 1966, {{the family}} moved to England. Bathurst {{transferred}} to the Worth Abbey boarding school in Sussex, which he much preferred to the school in Kells. At the age of 13, he began acting in minor skits and revues and read old copies of Plays and Players magazine, [...] "studying floor plans of theatres and reading about new theatres being built". He had first become interested in acting when his family saw a pantomime at the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> actors waiting for their cues in the wings.|$|E
500|$|Jack White of The White Stripes and Alicia Keys {{collaborated on}} [...] "Another Way to Die," [...] the first Bond music duet. They {{had wanted to}} work {{together}} for two years beforehand. The song was recorded in Nashville, Tennessee; White played the drums while Keys performed on the piano. The Memphis Horns {{also contributed to the}} track. White's favourite Bond theme is John Barry's instrumental piece for On Her Majesty's Secret Service, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> various opening credit sequences from the series for inspiration while mixing the track. Mark Ronson and Amy Winehouse had recorded a demo track for the film, but Ronson explained Winehouse's well-publicised legal issues in the preceding weeks made her [...] "not ready to record any music" [...] at that time.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} Broadway production {{opened at}} the Majestic Theatre on April 19, 1945. [...] The dress rehearsal the day before had gone badly, and the pair feared the new work would not be well received. [...] One successful last-minute change was to have de Mille choreograph the pantomime. [...] The movement of the carnival crowd in the pantomime had been entrusted to Mamoulian, and his version was not working. [...] Rodgers had injured his back the previous week, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> the opening from a stretcher propped in a box behind the curtain. [...] Sedated with morphine, he could see {{only part of the}} stage. [...] As he could not hear the audience's applause and laughter, he assumed the show was a failure. [...] It was not until friends congratulated him later that evening that he realized that the curtain had been met by wild applause. [...] Bambi Linn, who played Louise, was so enthusiastically received by the audience during her ballet that she was forced to break character, when she next appeared, and bow. [...] Rodgers' daughter Mary caught sight of her friend, Stephen Sondheim, both teenagers then, across several rows; both had eyes wet with tears.|$|E

500|$|According to Jenna Fischer, {{the series}} used an unusual casting process {{which did not}} involve a script. The {{producers}} would ask the actors several questions and they would respond as the characters they were auditioning for. NBC programmer Kevin Reilly originally suggested Paul Giamatti to producer Ben Silverman {{for the role of}} Michael Scott, but the actor declined. Martin Short, Hank Azaria, and Bob Odenkirk were reported to be interested in the part. In January 2004, Variety reported that Steve Carell, of the popular Comedy Central program The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, was in talks to play the role. At the time, he was already committed to another NBC mid-season replacement comedy, Come to Papa, but the series was quickly canceled, allowing his full commitment to The Office. Carell later stated that he had only seen about half of the original pilot episode of the British series before he auditioned. He did not continue watching for fear that he would start copying Gervais' characterizations. Other people who were considered or auditioned for the role included Ben Falcone, Alan Tudyk, Jim Zulevic, and Paul F. Tompkins. Rainn Wilson was cast as power-hungry sycophant Dwight Schrute, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> every episode of the series before he auditioned. Wilson had originally auditioned for Michael, a performance that he described as a [...] "terrible Ricky Gervais impersonation"; however, the casting directors liked his audition as Dwight much more and hired him. Seth Rogen, Matt Besser, Patton Oswalt, and Judah Friedlander also auditioned for the role.|$|E
2500|$|The Russian Revolution of 1917 caused Charles {{much concern}} <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> anxiously during the ensuing power struggles between the left- and right-wing parties in Germany. On {{the morning of}} 9 November 1918, during the German Revolution the Workers' and Soldiers' Council of Gotha {{declared}} him deposed. On 11 November, his abdication was demanded in Coburg. Only on 14 November, later than most other ruling princes, did he formally announce that he had [...] "ceased to rule" [...] in both Gotha and Coburg. He did not explicitly renounce his throne.|$|E
2500|$|His first single, [...] "New Song", was {{released}} in September 1983. It reached the Top 30 in the US and the Top 5 in the UK. He made his debut performance on BBC Television's Top of the Pops on 22 September 1983, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> his tape-delayed performance on a borrowed television resting on an ironing board before a concert at the University of Kent. He subsequently had four more hits over the next twelve months and a UK Number 1 album, Human's Lib, which eventually went double platinum. Credited with jointly writing the lyrics for six songs on the album was the lyricist Bill Bryant. [...] "New Song", [...] "What Is Love", and [...] "Pearl in the Shell" [...] all did well during 1983 and 1984. Human's Lib was certified gold and platinum in several countries. Jones had developed a loyal teen following. His parents ran his fan club.|$|E

50|$|Dean Creech is Garrett's {{housekeeper}} and cook. Dean is elderly, around 70 years old, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> {{the house}} while Garrett is away. Dean dislikes cleaning the Dead Man's room, and is somewhat unnerved {{by the presence}} of the Dead Man in general. Dean is generally critical of Garrett's lady friends, with the exceptions of Tinnie Tate and Maya Stump, whom he adores.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now here's {{what bothers}} me. She knows music. I {{asked her if}} she played. <b>And</b> <b>he's</b> fixed that place up like a palace. That being so, why hasn't he a piano for her? Another thing: she's quick <b>and</b> lively <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> her {{whenever}} she talks. <b>He's</b> on pins <b>and</b> needles, and continually breaking in and leading the conversation. Say, did you ever hear that Swithin Hall was married?" ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{invasion}} commenced on 24 June 1812. Napoleon {{had sent}} a final offer of peace to Saint Petersburg shortly before commencing operations. He never received a reply, so he gave the order to proceed into Russian Poland. He initially met little resistance and moved quickly into the enemy's territory. The French coalition of forces amounted to 449,000 men and 1,146 cannons being opposed by the Russian armies combining to muster 153,000 Russians, 938 cannons, and 15,000 Cossacks. The center of mass of French forces focused on Kaunas and the crossings {{were made by the}} French Guard, I, II and III corps amounting to some 120,000 at this point of crossing alone. The actual crossings were made in the area of Alexioten where three pontoon bridges were constructed. The sites had been selected by Napoleon in person. [...] Napoleon had a tent raised <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> and reviewed troops as they crossed the Neman River. Roads in this area of Lithuania hardly qualified as such, actually being small dirt tracks through areas of dense forest. Supply lines simply could not keep up with the forced marches of the corps and rear formations always suffered the worst privations.|$|E
2500|$|When she {{was about}} 13 years of age, her father, William Chatfield Booth, moved his family from Yaphank, {{in which she was}} born, to Brooklyn, New York, and there Mr. Booth {{organized}} the first public school that was established in that city. Mr. Booth was a man well qualified both by education and by native character for the guidance of such an intelligence as that developed by his daughter. Deeply interested in scholarly matters, a man of great directness of purpose and of fearless integrity, he and his daughter were in perfect sympathy, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> her growth with tender solicitude, and in subsequent years cherished with pride every word of her writing. But he could never quite bring himself to believe, even after she had won a handsome independence by her exertions, that she was really altogether capable of her own support, and always insisted upon making her the most generous gifts. As the President of the United States said of him, [...] "A kinder and more honorable gentleman {{it would be hard to}} find." [...] Another daughter and two sons comprised the remainder of his family, the younger of the sons, Colonel Charles A. Booth, saw 20 years' service in the army.|$|E

2500|$|The {{narrative}} {{starts with}} Leland Conrad Powers getting interested in cults <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> a Black Mass {{from behind a}} tree being performed by Zach Carson.

[...] In retribution, Carson evokes Satan to summon a typhoon.|$|R

6000|$|<b>And</b> incuriously <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> a saloon-keeper, {{whose face}} was {{plastered}} {{over with a}} huge mustache, come out and hang a sign, [...] "Porter wanted in A.M.," [...] on the saloon door.|$|R
60|$|This was a {{surprise}} arranged by the curate, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> with pleasure Mary's look of delighted astonishment.|$|E
60|$|She was silent, unsympathetic, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> her moodily, {{realizing how}} {{impossible}} {{it was for}} her to understand {{what he had been}} through.|$|E
60|$|She {{continued}} eating awhile without comment. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> her as one fascinated, {{oblivious to}} his surroundings, in a turmoil {{of thought and}} emotion.|$|E
60|$|Phineas Duge nodded. He {{showed no}} {{disappointment}} at the ill-success {{of this first}} effort, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was <b>watching</b> Vine all the time curiously.|$|R
60|$|As Mr. Lorry {{received}} these confidences, <b>and</b> as <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> {{the face}} of his friend now sixty-two years of age, a misgiving arose within him that such dread experiences would revive the old danger.|$|R
50|$|The next day, {{the boys}} are called to Fearless' and Teresa's house for an announcement. There, they reveal the couple is going to adopt Misty. He takes leave of his friends <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> {{on the front porch}} with Fearless and Teresa as the other three orphans walk away and begin playing on some rocks down the beach. Misty realises that they are his true family, and asks Fearless <b>and</b> Teresa if <b>he</b> can stay with them instead. They accept, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> returns home with the orphans.|$|R
60|$|She turned away, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> her as {{she slowly}} ascended. Then, with his hands always in his pockets, {{he went back to}} the empty drawing-room.|$|E

60|$|The girl rose <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> her intently as {{she came}} towards him with a glass. When she entered the {{moonlight}} his heart gave a sudden throb.|$|E
50|$|Gerdelman knew wrestling due to Hulk Hogan's role in Rocky III <b>and</b> after <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> WrestleMania I. His {{favorite}} wrestler was The Ultimate Warrior, {{followed by}} Shawn Michaels, Ricky Steamboat, Tito Santana and The British Bulldogs.|$|R
60|$|Johnnie gave a great sigh, {{and looked}} at his father, but made no answer. Papa's writing was a matter of curiosity, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> stood <b>watching</b> in silence.|$|R
50|$|Owen sneaks out {{to spend}} the night at Abby's. The next morning, the detective forces his way into Abby's {{apartment}} and finds her asleep.

Abby tells Owen she will have to leave town. They share a kiss <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>watches</b> tearfully as she enters a taxi and leaves.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed as}} if the {{crackers}} increased rather than satisfied his hunger, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> Jim eagerly as the latter finished a generous meal of meat, cheese, and hard-boiled eggs.|$|E
6000|$|... "I’m {{not going}} to, sir," [...] said Master Jones, charmed with his manner, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> breathlessly as the skipper stepped forward, and, peering down the forecastle, called loudly for Sam.|$|E
60|$|Skip {{knew that}} {{in the pocket of}} the one worn by Bill was the paper he had been {{instructed}} to steal, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>watched</b> eagerly for an opportunity to creep up unobserved.|$|E
