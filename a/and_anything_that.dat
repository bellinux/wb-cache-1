5|$|Carl (Martin Sheen's character) {{represents}} {{the working class}} in the film: he is the union leader for the maintenance workers at Bluestar. He constantly attacks big business, money, mandatory drug screening, greedy manufacturers, <b>and</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> he sees {{as a threat to}} his union. The conflict between Gekko's relentless pursuit of wealth and Carl Fox's leftward leanings form the basis of the film's subtext. This subtext could be described as the concept of the two fathers battling for control over the morals of the son, a concept Stone had also used in Platoon. In Wall Street the hard-working Carl Fox and the cutthroat businessman Gordon Gekko represent the fathers. The producers of the film use Carl as their voice in the film, a voice of reason amid the creative destruction brought about by Gekko's unrestrained personal philosophy.|$|E

25|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance is extremely useful for analyzing samples non-destructively. Radio waves and static magnetic fields easily penetrate {{many types of}} matter <b>and</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> is not inherently ferromagnetic. For example, various expensive biological samples, such as nucleic acids, including RNA and DNA, or proteins, can be studied using nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} for weeks or months before using destructive biochemical experiments. This also makes nuclear magnetic resonance {{a good choice for}} analyzing dangerous samples.|$|E
25|$|When saying Kiddush, {{the blessing}} over the wine (or over the bread) precedes the blessing over the day. One {{does not need}} to wash his hands before saying Kiddush but he should wash them after. The towel used to wash one's hands should not be placed on the table, lest it <b>and</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> comes into contact with it be {{rendered}} ritually unclean. Following the meal, all the crumbs in the dining room should be thoroughly swept up, then those involved should wash their hands.|$|E

Foreign nationals living in Thailand go to the Special Branch office to secure a Thai police clearance certificate. Other cases such as lèse majesté, terrorism, <b>and</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> endangers Thai national security are also handled by the Thai SB.|$|E

25|$|Propp's {{approach}} {{has been criticized for}} removing all verbal considerations from the analysis, even though the folktale's form is almost always oral, and also all considerations of tone, mood, character, <b>and</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> differentiates one fairy tale from another. One of the most prominent critics of Propp is the French structuralist Claude Lévi-Strauss, who used Propp's monograph on the morphology of the folktale to demonstrate the superiority of the structuralist approach, and the shortcomings of the formalist approach. Propp responded to this criticism in a sharply-worded rebuttal: he wrote that Lévi-Strauss showed no interest in empirical investigation.|$|E
25|$|Cézanne syntax didn't just ripple {{outwards}} {{over the}} sphere, touching those {{that would become}} Cubists in France, Futurists in Italy and Die Brücke, Der Blaue Reiter, Expressionists in Germany, it also created currents that flowed throughout Parisian art world threatening to destabilize (if not topple) {{at least three of}} the core foundations of the academia: the geometrical method of perspective used to create the illusion of form, space and depth since the Renaissance; Figuratism, derived from real object sources (and therefore representational), and aesthetics. At the time, it was assumed that all art aims at beauty, <b>and</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> wasn't beautiful couldn't be counted as art. The proto-Cubists revolted against the concept that objective beauty was central to the definition of art.|$|E
25|$|He was {{an early}} proponent of science and tried to observe and explain {{different}} aspects of the universe, with a particular interest in its origins, claiming that nature is ruled by laws, just like human societies, <b>and</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> disturbs the balance of nature does not last long. Like many thinkers of his time, Anaximander's philosophy included contributions to many disciplines. In astronomy, he attempted to describe the mechanics of celestial bodies in relation to the Earth. In physics, his postulation that the indefinite (or apeiron) was the source of all things led Greek philosophy to a new level of conceptual abstraction. His knowledge of geometry allowed him to introduce the gnomon in Greece. He created a map of the world that contributed greatly to the advancement of geography. He was also involved in the politics of Miletus and was sent as a leader to one of its colonies.|$|E

500|$|During La Luz del Mundo's {{religious}} services, {{male and}} female members are separated during worship; from the preacher's perspective, [...] women sit {{on the right side}} of the temple and men on the left. The Church does not use musical instruments during its services. There is no dancing or clapping, and women cover their heads with a veil during worship services. Hymns are sung a cappella; Despite this, members listen to instrumental music and some [...] compose their music. When singing, all congregants sing at the same time, to [...] maintain uniformity during their religious meetings. The Church believes that worship should be done [...] "spiritually" [...] and only to God, and thus temples are devoid of images, saints, crosses, <b>and</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> might be considered idolatry. The places of worship have plain walls and wide, clear windows.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the five-hour BBC adaptation, Wright compressed his film into two hours and nine minutes of screen time. He remarked that the film is [...] "obviously about Elizabeth and Darcy, following them <b>and</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> detracts or diverts you from that story {{is what you have}} to cut". Some of the most notable changes from the original book include time compression of several major sequences, including the departure of Wickham and the militia, Elizabeth's visit to Rosings Park and Hunsford Parsonage, Elizabeth's visit to Pemberley, Lydia's elopement and subsequent crisis; the elimination of several supporting characters, including Mr and Mrs Hurst, Mr and Mrs Phillips, Lady and Maria Lucas, Mrs Younge, several of Lydia's friends (including Colonel and Mrs Forster) and various military officers and townspeople; and the elimination of several sections in which characters reflect or converse on events that have recently occurred—for example, Elizabeth's chapter-long change of mind after reading Darcy's letter.|$|E

Now what Madonna is telling them is, hey, there's an alternative." [...] Tipper Gore, a founder of the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), who a year earlier denounced Madonna for the sexual lyrical content of her single [...] "Dress You Up", and had led a campaign against explicit content in music, commended Madonna for speaking candidly about such a serious subject and important social issue. When speaking of the song, Gore said [...] "the song speaks to a serious subject with a sense of urgency and sensitivity in both the lyrics and Madonna's rendition. It also speaks to the fact that there's got to be more support and more communication in families about this problem, <b>and</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> fosters that I applaud." ...|$|E

In October 2007, Fox Atomic pre-emptively purchased {{the rights to}} Cody's script with Megan Fox to star. Peter Rice, {{who at the time}} oversaw Fox Searchlight and Fox Atomic, brought in the project as Fox Searchlight had previously distributed Cody's film Juno. Mason Novick and Reitman's producing partner Dan Dubiecki signed as producers in November 2007 with plans to produce the film under Hard C, which is housed at Fox Searchlight. Reitman commented, [...] "We want to make unusual films, <b>and</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> turns a genre on its ear interests Dan and I." [...] Karyn Kusama was announced as director in January 2008. Kusama said she signed on to the project because of the script. [...] "I was blessed to read this script at a moment where the producers were meeting with directors and it just knocked me out. It was just so original, so imaginative", she stated. [...] "That's what it is about this script and the world is that it feels like a fairy tale gone psycho and I think that's what most fairy tales actually started as." [...] Additionally, Cody, Reitman and Kusama knew the film would be R rated because of the language.|$|E

2500|$|The current {{preference}} among Shakespearian scholars is to {{deny that}} the Sonnets are autobiographical.

In contrast, assuming that Marlowe did survive and was exiled in disgrace, Marlovians claim that the Sonnets reflect what must have happened to him after that.|$|E
