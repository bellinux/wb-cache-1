25|$|Thomas was {{admitted}} to the Missouri bar on September 13, 1974. From 1974 to 1977, Thomas was an Assistant Attorney General of Missouri under State Attorney General John Danforth, who met Thomas at Yale Law School. Thomas was the only black member of Danforth's staff. As Assistant Attorney General, Thomas first worked at the criminal <b>appeals</b> <b>division</b> of Danforth's office and moved on to the revenue and taxation division. Retrospectively, Thomas considers Assistant Attorney General the best job he has ever had. When Danforth was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976, Thomas left to become an attorney with the Monsanto Chemical Company in St. Louis, Missouri. He moved to Washington, D.C. and returned to work for Danforth from 1979 to 1981 as a Legislative Assistant handling energy issues for the Senate Commerce Committee. The two men shared a common bond in that they had studied to be ordained (although in different denominations). Danforth was to be instrumental in championing Thomas for the Supreme Court.|$|E

500|$|The plaintiffs appealed and {{the case}} went before the Alberta Supreme Court <b>appeals</b> <b>division</b> in January 1935. [...] On February2, by a 3–2 decision, the court upheld Ives' ruling. [...] The {{majority}} ruling by Chief Justice Horace Harvey cast serious doubts on MacMillan's credibility, calling her story [...] "quite unsupported by other evidence" [...] and noting that she [...] "showed a readiness {{to admit that she}} may have been mistaken as regards very positive statements previously made when by the questions it appeared there may be independent evidence she was wrong". [...] In addition to agreeing with Ives on the points of law, he felt that the jury had not based its finding of fact on the evidence in the case. [...] Justices Mitchell and Ford concurred. [...] Justice Clarke, in dissent, agreed that MacMillan's story was unlikely, but expressed a willingness to defer to the jury on questions of fact. [...] On the legal questions, he cited a precedent written by Justice Harvey himself in which the chief justice had argued that the inclusion of seduced women as potential plaintiffs under the Seduction Act proved that its framers intended a broader definition of damage than financial damage. [...] Justice Lunney concurred. [...] The court was unanimous in upholding Ives' dismissal of Allan MacMillan's action, and he did not appeal further.|$|E

However, it has been noted by multiple sources that there conversion from Islam is not an offense under Pakistani law. In 1992, a local imam asked Iqbal to be sentenced to death for converting to Christianity. The Pakistani judge hearing the case rejected the idea, saying that Iqbal could only be sentenced if it could be proven he had committed blasphemy.|$|E
2500|$|Several have {{reported}} that the [...] exists and places the age of consent at 18 due to the inability to [...] "communicate" [...] to 16- and 17-year-olds about sexual activity. These reports are incorrect. The Washington Court of <b>Appeals,</b> <b>Division</b> 1 decided {{in the case of}} [...] that such communication has to be for the purposes of committing an illegal act under RCW Chapter 9.68A. Danforth's conviction was overturned by that ruling. However, the Washington Supreme Court in the case of [...] overturned the scope of the Danforth ruling (though not the result; Danforth would have still had his conviction overturned under the McNallie standard), applying the communication statute to encompass all sexual misconduct with a minor, not just those under RCW Chapter 9.68A, which deal mostly with illegal child pornography and prostitution. In State v. Luther, the Court of Appeals concluded, that [...] "the Legislature never intended that RCW 9.68A.090 proscribe communications about sexual conduct that would be legal if performed, and that conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider constitutional argument based on procedural due process.". Due to these cases, it is clear that communications with 16- and 17-year-olds just for general sexual activity is legal, as long as such conduct discussed is not about illegal conduct or would be illegal in real life (such as the teacher/student circumstance, the foster parent/foster child circumstance, the significant relationship abuse circumstance, or asking for illegal pictures or attempting to bring such younger persons into prostitution).|$|E
