Yao was not <b>angry</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> promotion {{because he was}} not familiar with American stereotypes of Chinese. In an earlier interview in 2000, Yao said he had never seen a fortune cookie in China and guessed it must have been an American invention.|$|E
5|$|Phil Boersma {{opened the}} scoring for Liverpool in the 20th minute {{when he was}} first to reach the loose ball that had been blocked by David Harvey from a shot by Keegan. Later in the first half, a shot by Emlyn Hughes from outside the penalty area hit the Leeds crossbar. The match was notorious for the fistfight between Bremner and Keegan, who were jointly {{dismissed}} by referee Bob Matthewson after sixty minutes' play. Keegan, who was <b>angry</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> decision because he claimed provocation, took off his shirt as he left the field and threw it away. Bremner, several yards behind him, then did the same. Trevor Cherry headed home the Leeds equaliser in the 70th minute and the match finished 1–1.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} this era, Rome {{had become}} full of {{unemployed}} Plebeians. They then began filling the ranks of the assemblies, {{and the fact that they}} were no longer away from Rome made it easier for them to vote. In the principle legislative assembly, the Plebeian Council, any individual voted in the Tribe that his ancestors had belonged to. Thus, most of these newly unemployed Plebeians belonged to one of the thirty-one rural Tribes, rather than one of the four urban Tribes, and the unemployed Plebeians soon acquired so much political power that the Plebeian Council became highly populist. These Plebeians were often <b>angry</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> aristocracy, which further exacerbated the class tensions. Their economic state usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered the most for them, or at least for the candidate whose games or whose bribes were the most magnificent. The fact that they were usually uninformed as to the issues before them didn't matter, because they usually sold their votes to the highest bidder anyway. Bribery became such a problem that major reforms were ultimately passed, in particular the requirement that all votes be by secret ballot. A new culture of dependency was emerging, which would look to any populist leader for relief.|$|E
5|$|Frank Grimes' {{favorite}} television series, Dishonorable Discharge, ends {{after six}} seasons {{and it is}} revealed that the entire series was just an angel's dream. Grimes is outraged and determined to change the ending. Later, Mark Lilly tells his girlfriend, the half-demon Callie Maggotbone, {{that he has not}} seen his father since his sixth birthday. Mark's roommate, the zombie Randall, is touched by this and decides to document Mark's journey to find his father, so that he can become a Hollywood director. Mark is assigned by Twayne Boneraper to investigate Grimes, who has been busting people who enjoyed the ending of Dishonorable Discharge. He and Randall (who documents everything with his video camera) ride along with Grimes. In a memory sequence of Grimes', it is revealed that he was a real cop in the 1970s and worked with an undercover expert named Jimmy. He was dishonorably discharged from the force and repressed all of his memories of being a cop. Mark figures that this is why he is so <b>angry</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ending of the series, and takes him through his past by using the same car Grimes and his partner Jimmy had. In the car, Grimes has a memory sequence again and drives to Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Harvey was {{selected}} to play his only Test, the Fourth Test at Adelaide, filling in for the injured Barnes. England batted first and made 460 before being dismissed late on the second day. Harvey opened with Arthur Morris, and made 12 in the first innings before being bowled by Bedser while playing an aggressive shot. With {{only a few minutes}} of play left, the Australian captain Don Bradman came in and he too was bowled by Bedser, without scoring a run. Harvey later privately said the Bradman had told him to play cautiously and survive {{until the end of the}} day, rather than attack, and that the captain was <b>angry</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> resulting two wickets. According to Harvey, Bradman told him that he would never be selected for Australia again. The tourists then declared during the last afternoon and left Australia a target of 314. The target was not a realistic offer and Morris and Harvey put on an opening stand of 116 before the latter was bowled for 31 by the medium pace of occasional bowler Norman Yardley. The match ended in a draw with Australia on 1/215.|$|E

The apparent homoeroticism between the speaker {{and the young man}} has spurred debates about the sexuality of the speaker and consequently Shakespeare himself. There are 3 main points to discuss with this issue: the problem of ambiguity in the writing, the possibility of applying an anachronistic view of love and consequently mistaking these sonnets homoerotic, and finally the implications of Shakespeare's life and homosexual tendencies.|$|E
25|$|Most of the Indians who {{actually}} lived and hunted in the Ohio Valley—Shawnees, Mingos, Delawares, and Wyandots—had not been consulted in the 1768 treaties. <b>Angry</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Iroquois for selling their lands to the British, Shawnees began {{to organize a}} confederacy of western Indians {{with the intention of}} preventing the loss of their lands. British and Iroquois officials worked to diplomatically isolate the Shawnees from other Indian nations, however, and so when Dunmore's War broke out in 1774, Shawnees faced the Virginia militia with few allies. After Virginia's victory in the war, the Shawnees were compelled to accept the Ohio River boundary. Shawnee and Mingo leaders who did not agree with these terms renewed the struggle soon after the American Revolutionary War began in 1775.|$|E

He couldn't understand how they were put in a position to tell the Egyptians all about their family. When the sons of Israel opened their sacks, they saw their money that they used to pay for the grain. It was still in their possession, and so they all became afraid. Israel then became <b>angry</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> loss of Joseph, Simeon, and now possibly Benjamin.|$|E

25|$|In late 1913, Jean-Baptiste Rouvière and Guillaume Le Roux, two Missionary Oblates, were on {{a mission}} to convert the Copper Inuit in the Coppermine River region to Roman Catholicism while heading towards Coronation Gulf. They were doing this, they claimed, because they had heard rumours that Anglican missionaries were {{attempting}} to perform the same in that region, and wanted to convert the Inuit in the area to their denomination first. The priests enlisted the assistance of Uloqsaq as well as Sinnisiak, another hunter, and paid them in traps. However, Le Roux, who had a short temper, quickly got <b>angry</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> two Inuit men, who soon decided that Le Roux's anger meant that the priests wanted to kill them. Sinnisiak urged Uloqsaq to help him kill the two men, and the priests were shot, stabbed and axed to death. For ritualistic reasons, the two Inuit ate a portion of the two priests' livers.|$|E
25|$|Together {{with the}} Doctor, Jamie {{encounters}} Cybermen, Daleks, the Yeti in the London Underground, the Ice Warriors, {{and many other}} dangers. Jamie is particularly fond and protective of Victoria, {{due in part to}} her being an elegant Victorian lady. For example, in The Ice Warriors Jamie's first priority is to rescue Victoria despite being injured {{to the point where he}} can't walk. Jamie is heartbroken when Victoria decides to stay with the Harris family at the end of Fury from the Deep, to the point of even being briefly <b>angry</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Doctor for allowing her to leave (The Wheel in Space). Jamie initially finds Zoe's more modern attitudes and bossy nature irritating, but eventually adopts the same protective attitude disguised by the same bantering he engages in with the Doctor. Often Jamie's simple common sense beats Zoe's strict logic, such as in The Dominators where Jamie realises that the erupting volcano is going to threaten the TARDIS, while the Doctor and Zoe are still congratulating themselves on defeating their enemies.|$|E
