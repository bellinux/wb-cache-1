50|$|In the 1950s Harman Kardon {{designed}} some of {{the first}} high fidelity audio products that lent to starting the high fidelity business. Integrated receivers (with a tuner, preamplifier and power amplifier) was an idea to introduce and provide high fidelity performance in a single unit. Integrated high fidelity receivers, however, were not new — Scott Radio Laboratories had manufactured such items in the late 1930s. The company's first product was <b>an</b> <b>FM</b> <b>tuner.</b>|$|R
50|$|In November 2009 the Chumby One was released: a similar, all-plastic {{version of}} the {{original}} in white with blue trim. The major difference was the hard plastic case replacing the soft leather. Other changes include a slightly faster processor, only one USB port on {{the rear of the}} device, and inclusion of <b>an</b> <b>FM</b> <b>tuner</b> and physical volume knob. The hard plastic case allowed Chumby Industries to offer the Chumby One at a reduced price of $119.95.|$|R
50|$|The naming {{scheme of}} Samsung players {{has always been}} the same. For example, YP-P2JEB, where J stands for Janus (MTP models, no letter if UMS), E stands for 16GB (V:256MB; X:512MB; Z:1GB; Q:2GB; A:4GB; C:8GB; E:16GB; N:32GB) and B stands for Black (W:White; P:Pink; S:Silver etc.).

50|$|With {{the success}} of the OA-21 {{amplifier}} and the OA-20, Onix Audio released an improved OA-20 called the OA-22 that included two CD inputs to allow for the wave of high output CD players of the time. All products in the meantime were continuing to be developed and evolved and <b>an</b> <b>FM</b> <b>tuner</b> (radio), the BWD-1, designed by Tony Brady, made its debut in 1987. The Onix BWD-1 provided a compromise between cost, musical integrity, and quality performance.|$|R
50|$|The 6800 was {{the first}} in the series and was a {{dual-band}} GSM 900/1800 phone with support for GPRS. The 6800 had <b>an</b> <b>FM</b> radio <b>tuner</b> and 5MB of memory.|$|R

5000|$|<b>A</b> few {{existing}} <b>FM</b> <b>tuners</b> {{tuned to}} <b>a</b> channel broadcasting an HD Radio signal {{are prone to}} increased noise on the analog signal, called [...] "HD Radio self-noise" [...] (http://www.ham-radio.com/k6sti/hdrsn.htm), due to analog demodulation of the digital signal(s). In some high fidelity <b>FM</b> <b>tuners</b> in quality playback systems this noise can be audible and irritating. <b>A</b> few existing <b>FM</b> <b>tuners</b> might require major internal modifications to the internal filters (http://www.ham-radio.com/k6sti/iboccer.htm) or {{the addition of a}} post-detection filter (http://www.ham-radio.com/k6sti/ibocfltr.htm) may be required to prevent degradation of the analog signal quality on stations broadcasting with HD Radio.|$|R

These devices often require external power and convert the device's electrical signal into radio waves {{which are then}} transmitted over <b>an</b> unused <b>FM</b> frequency to <b>a</b> nearby <b>FM</b> <b>tuner.</b> The cassette adapter is usually considered superior as it is much less prone to interference.|$|R

Some models from Panasonic also included <b>an</b> <b>FM</b> <b>tuner.</b> <b>A</b> major exception to this convention is TV/DVD combos, which can have a stereo VCR included in the unit (i.e. a TV/VCR/DVD combo). One of the major drawbacks of a TV/DVD/VCR combo is that the integrated VCR can sometimes activate the CSS programming on the DVD player portion, making it impossible to watch DVDs on the unit.|$|R

5000|$|With {{the summer}} feel of Neon Indian's [...] "Deadbeat Summer" [...] {{and the overall}} {{presence}} of samplers, strings, drum machines, live drums, guitars, horns and homemade mbiras instrumentally, No Más is a MGMT-inspired experimental pop and chillwave album recreating the peak of every well-known genre, examples including chicago soul, psychedelic pop and 1970s instrumental film soundtracks. As Langford puts it, [...] "I love making music that has flaws and human fingerprints all over it. There's also that grey area where you can't tell what's a sample, although it leaves you wanting to say, 'Hey, I did that!'" [...] The sound was described by Pitchfork Media's Rob Mitchum as [...] "Less turntablism, more <b>an</b> <b>FM</b> <b>tuner</b> shoulder-jostling between low-watt stations playing electro, funk, world music, and early hip-hop." ...|$|R
