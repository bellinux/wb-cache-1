5|$|Canada {{launched}} several bids to {{host the}} Winter Olympics in Banff, with the first bid for the 1964 Winter Olympics, which were eventually awarded to Innsbruck, Austria. Canada narrowly lost a second bid, for the 1968 Winter Olympics, which were awarded to Grenoble, France. Once again, Banff launched a bid {{to host the}} 1972 Winter Olympics, with plans to hold the Olympics at Lake Louise. The 1972 bid was controversial, <b>as</b> <b>environmental</b> lobby groups strongly opposed the bid, which had sponsorship from Imperial Oil. Bowing to pressure, Jean Chrétien, then the Minister of Environment, the government department responsible for Parks Canada, withdrew support for the bid, which was eventually lost to Sapporo, Japan. When nearby Calgary hosted the 1988 Winter Olympics, the cross-country ski events were held at the Canmore Nordic Centre Provincial Park at Canmore, Alberta, located just outside the eastern gates of Banff National Park on the Trans-Canada Highway.|$|E
5|$|Committed {{to living}} the {{philosophy}} they sing about, {{the band members}} have each pursued careers apart from their lives as the superstars of Malagasy pop music.

As the years passed {{and the members of the}} band matured in their respective careers, they started to write songs more relevant to the difficult conditions of life of the Malagasy people and the underdeveloped state of the nation, addressing such topics <b>as</b> <b>environmental</b> conservation, poverty, education, and violence. Among their hits in this period are songs that address rural-urban flight, homesickness after moving abroad to find work, husbands who abandon their families, and the guilt of military personnel required to carry out repression against their compatriots.|$|E

5|$|In late October 2010, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{began to}} monitor a weak area of disorganized weather along the {{southern}} periphery of a frontal system, associated with a broad surface trough east-northeast of Puerto Rico. Supported by an upper-level low retrograding to its southwest, the system generated clusters of scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms, otherwise known as convection. The activity gradually enhanced <b>as</b> <b>environmental</b> conditions within its encounter became more favorable over time. Around 1200UTC October28, satellite imagery showed {{what appeared to be}} the formation of a surface low within the trough. Shower and thunderstorm activity accordingly intensified, and the NHC assessed a high chance for tropical or subtropical development. At the time, the center of circulation remained poor; however, it became better defined later that day, with a stable amount of corresponding convection. Although the upper low had remained adjacent, it was located well to the southwest of the system's small wind radius, an atypical structure for a subtropical cyclone. The system was therefore operationally designated as Tropical Storm Shary at 0000UTC October 29, though post-season analysis revealed a tropical depression had formed by 1800 UTC October 28, about 520mi (830km) south-southeast of Bermuda. At the time of classification, the agency noted that Shary would be a relatively short-lived tropical cyclone due to a merge with a cold front forecast to occur within the following 48 hours.|$|E
5|$|Mortality {{rates were}} high {{compared}} with England and other European nations. Evidence suggests a national death rate of 30 per 1,000 in 1755, 24 in the 1790s and 22 {{in the early}} 1860s. Mortality tended to be much higher in urban than rural settlements. The first time these were measured, 1861–82, in the four major cities these were 28.1 per 1,000 and 17.9 in rural areas. Mortality probably peaked in Glasgow in the 1840s, when large inflows of population from the Highlands and Ireland combined population outgrowing sanitary provision and combining with outbreaks of epidemic disease. National rates began to fall in the 1870s, particularly in the cities, <b>as</b> <b>environmental</b> conditions improved. By 1930–32 the national rate was 13.4 per 1,000, with a rate of 14.1 and in rural areas 12.8.|$|E
5|$|On August20, 2015, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began {{monitoring}} {{a tropical}} wave over western Africa, near the Atlantic shore. The disorganized system emerged over the Atlantic Ocean several hundred {{miles southeast of}} the Cape Verde Islands the following day. Moving quickly west, the system bypassed the Cape Verde Islands to the south on August22, but remained largely disorganized. A sharp trough developed within expanding deep convection on August23, though a well-defined circulation did not consolidate. Organization of the low improved throughout the day <b>as</b> <b>environmental</b> conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis. The trough acquired gale-force winds the following day and finally developed a closed circulation by 18:00UTC. The formation of a closed low marked the transition into a tropical cyclone; accordingly, the system was classified as Tropical Storm Erika, the fifth named storm of the annual hurricane season. Upon its designation, Erika was situated roughly 1,035mi (1,665km) east of the Lesser Antilles. The storm maintained a brisk westward trajectory, steered by a subtropical ridge to the north.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} project became controversial <b>as</b> <b>environmental</b> protection non-governmental organizations (NGOs) drew public {{attention to a}} possible threat that may arise to seven species of bats. Subsequently, the NGOs alleged that the project is illegal, environmentally unsafe, financially not feasible, and technically questionable. Project legality was disputed because {{it is based on}} a 1999 environmental impact assessment (EIA), while Croatian legislation requires that EIAs must not be more than two years old. Flooding of Vilina Cave is cited as an environmental concern, while the financial issues are based on previous cost overruns by Hrvatska elektroprivreda—the state-owned company planning the development—in other projects. One objection to the technical aspects of the project is the possibility that the groundwater may trigger earthquakes. Opponents of the project have urged the Prime Minister of Croatia to cancel development of the plant.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Cyclone Bingiza was {{the only}} named storm to make {{landfall}} in the inactive 2010–11 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. The second of three storms, Bingiza developed on February9 to the northeast of Madagascar. For a few days it meandered generally southwestward, failing to intensify significantly. On February12, the storm began a steady westward track <b>as</b> <b>environmental</b> conditions became more favorable. In a 24‑hour period, Bingiza developed from a moderate tropical storm into an intense tropical cyclone with a well-defined eye. After attaining peak 10minute sustained winds of 155km/h (100mph), the cyclone moved ashore in northeastern Madagascar on February14 and quickly weakened as it crossed the country. It emerged into the Mozambique Channel as a weak tropical disturbance, and it turned southward to move across western Madagascar. Bingiza attained tropical storm status before making its final landfall near Morondava, dissipating on February18.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{growing to}} certain heights, the Star Plant grows through larger {{floating}} islands. These islands, {{along with the}} smaller ones surrounding the Star Plant, contain power-up crystals which can be collected to provide B.U.D. with extra abilities. Creatures and other plant life {{can also be found}} throughout the game's islands, as well <b>as</b> <b>environmental</b> features, such as caves and water currents. Some parts of the environment, such as leaves growing off of both the Star Plant and Star Shoots that allow the player to jump to greater heights than normally possible, can affect how the player moves throughout the world. Teleportation pads allow the player to move around the world quickly and act as save points. The player also respawns at their last activated teleportation pad if they die, which can be caused by falling long distances, being in too much water for too long, or by the player making B.U.D. self-destruct. Additionally, players can scan various flora and fauna into the teleporters to retrieve data from them. Items can be picked up by the player and stored in B.U.D.'s backpack one at a time, such as flower parachutes that make the player fall more slowly towards the ground, and leaf gliders that allow the player to travel further through the air.|$|E

5|$|With the popularisation of {{the motor}} car, {{it was found that}} plowing alone was {{insufficient}} for removing all snow and ice from the roadway, leading to the development of gritting vehicles, which used sodium chloride to accelerate the melting of the snow. Early attempts at gritting were resisted, as the salt used encouraged rusting, causing damage to the metal structures of bridges and the shoes of pedestrians. However, as the number of motoring accidents increased, the protests subsided {{and by the end of}} the 1920s, many cities in the United States used salt and sand to clear the roads and increase road safety. <b>As</b> <b>environmental</b> awareness increased through the 1960s and 1970s, gritting once again came under criticism due to its environmental impact, leading to the development of alternative de-icing chemicals and more efficient spreading systems.|$|E
