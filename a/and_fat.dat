5|$|The {{sandwich}} {{has a high}} sodium <b>and</b> <b>fat</b> content, and {{has been}} specifically targeted by UK café chains {{in an effort to}} reduce salt <b>and</b> <b>fat.</b> Due to this, low-fat mayonnaise is a common substitute along with low salt bread and less fatty bacon. In 2009, seven large cafe chains in the UK made a commitment to reducing salt <b>and</b> <b>fat</b> through similar substitutions. A more visible solution is to use turkey bacon in lieu of normal bacon. One of the variations on the BLT is the club sandwich, a two-layered sandwich in which one layer is a BLT. The other layer can be almost any sort of sliced meat, normally chicken or turkey.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that visceral fat releases {{free fatty acids}} and adipokines and thereby exposes the liver to fat accumulation. The authors aimed to evaluate current epidemiologic evidence for an association between abdominal <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> liver <b>fat</b> content. Clinical <b>and</b> epidemiologic studies with data on abdominal <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> liver <b>fat</b> content were reviewed. Studies using waist circumference to estimate abdominal fat mass suggested a direct association between abdominal <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> liver <b>fat</b> content. Studies using imaging methods suggested a direct association between intraabdominal <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> liver <b>fat</b> content, but not between subcutaneous abdominal <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> liver <b>fat</b> content. In conclusion, clinical and epidemiologic studies of abdominal <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> liver <b>fat</b> content suggest a direct association between abdominal <b>fat</b> <b>and</b> liver <b>fat</b> content which is probably accounted for by visceral fat. However, results from the included studies do not allow strong conclusions regarding the temporal sequence of events. Future longitudinal studies are recommended to obtain additional information on associations and mechanisms. Both abdominal <b>fat</b> depots <b>and</b> other body compartments of interest should be included to further investigate the association between specific <b>fat</b> depots <b>and</b> liver <b>fat</b> content.

5|$|Although the Australian/New Zealand {{study found}} that the F94L {{mutation}} was partially to significantly recessive in most traits, meaning cattle heterozygous for the mutation express less to significantly {{less than half of the}} effects noted for homozygous cattle, the Japanese {{study found that}} the meat <b>and</b> <b>fat</b> quantities in cattle heterozygous for the mutation were about midway between the two extremes.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians {{possess a}} pancreas, liver and gall bladder. The liver is usually large with two lobes. Its size is {{determined}} by its function as a glycogen <b>and</b> <b>fat</b> storage unit, and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up. Adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen (in internal structures called fat bodies), under the skin and, in some salamanders, in the tail.|$|E

40|$|Vegetable oils <b>and</b> <b>fats</b> {{make up a}} {{significant}} part of the energy intake in typical European diets. However, their use as ingredients in a diverse range of different foods means that their consumption is often hidden, especially when oils <b>and</b> <b>fats</b> are used for cooking.

We have developed an innovative model to estimate the consumption of vegetable oils <b>and</b> <b>fats</b> by EU consumers using the EU consumption databases and elements of probabilistic modelling.

5|$|Cultured mysids {{are thought}} to provide an ideal food source for many marine organisms.

5|$|A Limousin/Jersey {{backcross}} {{study conducted}} in Australia and New Zealand {{to investigate the}} effects of the F94L myostatin variant concluded that the mutation had no significant effect on birth-weight and growth traits. Averaged over all backcross calves in the trial (total of 766), animals homozygous for the mutation had approximately 6% heavier carcases than animals without the mutation, 15% larger eye muscle (also known as rib eye) area, 13% heavier silverside weight, and 13% heavier total meat weight. Increased meat weight and size was accompanied by a 15% reduction in intra-muscular fat and 25% reduction in total fat weight. No other significant effects were observed. A second backcross study conducted in Japan of Limousin and Japanese Black breeds identified similar changes to meat <b>and</b> <b>fat</b> quantities in cattle homozygous for the F94L mutation.|$|E

5|$|Alkaloids {{are derived}} from various amino acids. Over 3000 known {{alkaloids}} exist, examples include nicotine, caffeine, morphine, cocaine, colchicine, ergolines, strychnine, and quinine. Alkaloids have pharmacological effects on humans and other animals. Some alkaloids can inhibit or activate enzymes, or alter carbohydrate <b>and</b> <b>fat</b> storage by inhibiting the formation phosphodiester bonds involved in their breakdown. Certain alkaloids bind to nucleic acids and can inhibit synthesis of proteins and affect DNA repair mechanisms. Alkaloids can also affect cell membrane and cytoskeletal structure causing the cells to weaken, collapse, or leak, and can affect nerve transmission. Although alkaloids act on a diversity of metabolic systems in humans and other animals, they almost uniformly invoke an aversively bitter taste.|$|E
