So his requirements to get to Paris are, like, beyond platinum editions; they're, like, beyond ultra-platinum editions; they're like diamond editions. So we love Snoop <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>wish</b> he had been here, but I think shooting him in L.A. will be good because we'll have more time, more control. He probably would have gotten really mobbed in the streets here anyway.|$|E

[...] Following the announcement, Evanston police continued to guard Northwestern's football field to prevent the burning of the wooden stands.

500|$|Other kitsune {{use their}} magic {{for the benefit}} of their {{companion}} or hosts as long as the human beings treat them with respect. As yōkai, however, kitsune do not share human morality, and a kitsune who has adopted a house in this manner may, for example, bring its host money or items that it has stolen from the neighbors. Accordingly, common households thought to harbor kitsune are treated with suspicion. Oddly, samurai families were often reputed to share similar arrangements with kitsune, but these foxes were considered zenko and the use of their magic a sign of prestige. Abandoned homes were common haunts for kitsune. One 12th-century story tells of a minister moving into an old mansion only to discover a family of foxes living there. They first try to scare him away, then claim that the house [...] "has been ours for many years, <b>and</b> ... <b>we</b> <b>wish</b> to register a vigorous protest." [...] The man refuses, and the foxes resign themselves to moving to an abandoned lot nearby.|$|E
500|$|Responding to Hayes' departure, Stone {{asserted}} that [...] "This is 100 percent {{having to do}} with his faith of Scientology... He has no problem—and he's cashed plenty of checks—with our show making fun of Christians." [...] According to Stone, neither he nor Trey Parker had [...] "heard a peep out of Isaac in any way until we did Scientology. He wants a different standard for religions other than his own, and to me, that is where intolerance and bigotry begin." [...] Stone commented that [...] "In 10 years and over 150 episodes of South Park, Isaac never had a problem with the show making fun of Christians, Muslims, Mormons and Jews. He got a sudden case of religious sensitivity when it was his religion featured on the show. To bring the civil rights struggle into this is just a non sequitur. Of course we will release Isaac from his contract <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>wish</b> him well." [...] According to a later commentary by Stone, prior to the episode's screening Hayes had asked the South Park creators to have Comedy Central pull the episode before it aired and not include it in the series DVD, which they refused.|$|E
