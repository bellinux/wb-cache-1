50|$|Hooper {{explains}} that scented water to bathe in {{can be made}} of dried herbs.

50|$|There {{are several}} methods of cooking a country ham {{including}} slicing and pan-frying, baking whole, <b>and</b> <b>simmering</b> <b>for</b> several hours (in several changes of water). Whole hams {{may need to}} be scrubbed and soaked for several hours before eating to remove the salt cure and mold. Even when soaked, they are still quite salty. For traditionalists, part of the appeal of country ham is this highly salty taste. Some eaters of country ham scrub, scrape, or pare off the outer crust of curatives, slice it, pan fry it, and eat it as is. Or they may fry the ham with the crust on. Some discard the crust; others consume it along with the meat. Traditionalists, when frying the ham, will typically only place it in a pan long enough to lightly brown it on both sides and to warm the meat. Frying times as short as thirty seconds per side are not uncommon.|$|R

5000|$|Baisao's {{method of}} {{preparing}} tea {{was referred to}} as sencha, or [...] "simmered tea". In this method, whole tea leaves would be tossed into a pot of boiling water <b>and</b> <b>simmered</b> <b>for</b> a short period of time. This style of tea differed from matcha, the most common tea in Japan at the time, which consists of tea leaves ground into a fine powder. The method of brewing tea by grinding it into a powder and whisking it with hot water was popular in China in the Song dynasty, during which Zen Buddhist monks first brought the practice to Japan. By contrast, the Obaku school of Zen specialized in brewing loose leaf green tea, a style that had gradually become popular in China during the Ming dynasty. Sencha partisans of the time opposed the rigid, elaborate formalism of the traditional chanoyu tea ceremony, which uses matcha. The comparative simplicity of adding tea leaves to water appealed to many Japanese monks and intellectuals (among them Baisao and much of his social circle) who admired the carefree attitude advocated by the ancient Chinese sages. Baisao himself saw tea as a path to spiritual enlightenment, a point he made repeatedly in his poetry.|$|R

5000|$|There are {{two common}} {{variations}} of beef noodle which {{differ in the}} way the broth is prepared. When soy sauce is added, the soup is called red roasted or braised beef noodles (紅燒牛肉麵). Braised beef noodles was reputedly invented by KMT's Sichuan Province recruits who fled from mainland China to Kaoshiung, Taiwan. Therefore, it is sometimes (misleadingly) referred to as [...] "Szechuan Beef Noodle Soup" [...] (四川牛肉麵). The red braised beef noodles is {{the most common type of}} beef noodle in Taiwan.

Chefs also let the stock <b>simmer</b> <b>for</b> long periods of time with bone marrow; some vendors can cook the beef stock for over 24 hours. This type of beef noodle tends to be spicy because doubanjiang and five-spice powder are sometimes added. However, the broth may also have a sweeter taste if the fat from the beef is simmered. There are several variations with the soy-based broth, such as spicy, tomato, garlic, and herbal medicine. The tomato variation (番茄牛肉麵) is popular in Taiwan and features chunks of tomatoes in a rich red-coloured soy-tomato broth. The herbal medicine variation is usually served without suancai as a topping and may be accompanied by a chili paste made from beef lard.|$|R

The extra food requirement strains still further the already depleted fertility of the soil. As incomes fall demand for cheap staples rises. More and more farmers are cultivating cassava in increasing quantities because it can grow even under harsh agronomic conditions. However, on its own cassava flour provides little or no protein; {{it needs to be}} enriched by the addition of some protein source. In Cameroon, trials conducted at the Rural Training Centre, Mfonta, have succeeded in creating a recipe integrating soyabean-flour into gari and make-banana, whilst still maintaining the original taste. To prepare the improved gari 10 kg of grated cassava is mixed with 1 to 1. 2 ka of fine soyabean flour. First the soyaflour is mixed with 2, 5 litres of water and a teaspoon of palm-oil, brought slowly to the boil <b>and</b> <b>simmered</b> <b>for</b> about 10 minutes (care should be taken to avoid burning).

25|$|It is {{possible}} to braise meats and vegetables in a pot {{on top of a}} grill.

There are two advantages to barbecue-braising; it allows browning of the meat directly on the grill before the braising. It also allows for glazing of meat with sauce and finishing it directly over the fire after the braising.
