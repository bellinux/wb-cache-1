40|$|Actor {{frameworks}} {{running on}} Java Virtual Machine (JVM) platform face two main challenges in utilizing multi-core architectures, i) efficiently mapping <b>actors</b> <b>to</b> JVM threads, and ii) scheduling JVM threads on multi-core. JVM-based actor frameworks allow fine tuning of <b>actors</b> <b>to</b> threads mapping, however scheduling of threads on multi-core {{is left to}} the OS scheduler. Hence, efficiently mapping <b>actors</b> <b>to</b> threads is critical for achieving good performance and scalability. In the existing JVM-based actor frameworks, programmers select default <b>actors</b> <b>to</b> threads mappings and iteratively fine tune the mappings until the desired performance is achieved. This process is tedious and time consuming when building large scale distributed applications. We propose a technique that automatically maps <b>actors</b> <b>to</b> JVM threads. Our technique {{is based on a}} set of heuristics with the goal of balancing actors computations across JVM threads and reducing communication overheads. We explain our technique {{in the context of the}} Panini programming language, which provides capsules as an actor-like abstraction for concurrency, but also explore its applicability to other approaches...|$|R
