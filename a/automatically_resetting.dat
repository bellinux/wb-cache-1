5000|$|Kohler {{continued}} {{to pursue his}} profession as a research engineer, as a designer of industrial electronic equipment, and as a consultant and lecturer. Kohler was granted many patents for various inventions {{in the course of}} his activities. Kohler's achievement with the greatest technological impact was patent 3243753 making possible the polyswitch, an <b>automatically</b> <b>resetting</b> circuit protection device which shuts off a circuit when a current overload is sensed but automatically resets when the surge is over, thus avoiding blown fuses and machine stoppages ...|$|E
50|$|Earlier DDC {{implementations}} used simple 8-bit data offset when {{communicating with}} the EDID memory in the monitor, limiting the storage size to 28 bytes = 256 bytes, but allowing the use of cheap 2-Kbit EEPROMs. In E-DDC, a special I²C addressing scheme was introduced, in which multiple 256-byte segments could be selected. To do this, a single 8-bit segment index is passed to the display via the I²C address 30h. (Because this access is always a write, the first I²C octet will always be 60h.). Data from the selected segment is then immediately read via the regular DDC2 address using a repeated I²C 'START' signal. However, VESA specification defines the segment index value range as 00h to 7Fh, so this only allows addressing 128 segments * 256 bytes = 32KB. The segment index register is volatile, defaulting to zero and <b>automatically</b> <b>resetting</b> to zero after each NACK or STOP. Therefore, it must be set every time access to data above the first 256-byte segment is performed. The auto-reset mechanism is to provide for backward compatibility to, for example, DDC2B hosts, otherwise they may be stuck at a segment other than 00h in some rare cases.|$|E
5000|$|On a rifle range, {{shooters}} typically fire at targets 100-300 yards (91-275 meters) {{or greater}} distance. Many rifle ranges feature mechanized steel targets that <b>automatically</b> <b>reset</b> upon being hit. Hunters in particular often use rifle ranges to calibrate or sight-in their rifles prior to hunting.|$|R
50|$|The device {{operates}} by shunting {{excess current}} when the induced voltage exceeds the avalanche breakdown potential. It is a clamping device, suppressing all overvoltages above its breakdown voltage. It <b>automatically</b> <b>resets</b> when the overvoltage goes away, but absorbs {{much more of}} the transient energy internally than a similarly rated crowbar device.|$|R
50|$|Electronic Dive Control Center - The game {{is played}} by {{pressing}} the buttons on the device, which {{is powered by a}} 9-volt battery. The device <b>automatically</b> <b>resets</b> {{at the beginning of each}} game, assigning treasure locations at random. It emits a variety of chip music sounds to signal events during game play.|$|R
40|$|As {{an energy}} carrier, {{electricity}} has no rival {{with regard to}} its environmental cleanliness, flexibility in interfacing with multiple production sources and end uses, and efficiency of delivery. In fact, the electric power grid was named ?the greatest engineering achievement of the 20 th century? by the National Academy of Engineering. This grid, a technological marvel ingeniously knitted together from local networks growing out from cities and rural centers, {{may be the biggest}} and most complex artificial system ever built. However, the growing demand for electricity will soon challenge the grid beyond its capability, compromising its reliability through voltage fluctuations that crash digital electronics, brownouts that disable industrial processes and harm electrical equipment, and power failures like the North American blackout in 2003 and subsequent blackouts in London, Scandinavia, and Italy in the same year. The North American blackout affected 50 million people and caused approximately $ 6 billion in economic damage over the four days of its duration. Superconductivity offers powerful new opportunities for restoring the reliability of the power grid and increasing its capacity and efficiency. Superconductors are capable of carrying current without loss, making the parts of the grid they replace dramatically more efficient. Superconducting wires carry up to five times the current carried by copper wires that have the same cross section, thereby providing ample capacity for future expansion while requiring no {{increase in the number of}} overhead access lines or underground conduits. Their use is especially attractive in urban areas, where replacing copper with superconductors in power-saturated underground conduits avoids expensive new underground construction. Superconducting transformers cut the volume, weight, and losses of conventional transformers by a factor of two and do not require the contaminating and flammable transformer oils that violate urban safety codes. Unlike traditional grid technology, superconducting fault current limiters are smart. They increase their resistance abruptly in response to overcurrents from faults in the system, thus limiting the overcurrents and protecting the grid from damage. They react fast in both triggering and <b>automatically</b> <b>resetting</b> after the overload is cleared, providing a new, self-healing feature that enhances grid reliability. Superconducting reactive power regulators further enhance reliability by instantaneously adjusting reactive power for maximum efficiency and stability in a compact and economic package that is easily sited in urban grids. Not only do superconducting motors and generators cut losses, weight, and volume by a factor of two, but they are also much more tolerant of voltage sag, frequency instabilities, and reactive power fluctuations than their conventional counterparts. The challenge facing the electricity grid to provide abundant, reliable power will soon grow to crisis proportions. Continuing urbanization remains the dominant historic demographic trend in the United States and in the world. By 2030, nearly 90 % of the U. S. population will reside in cities and suburbs, where increasingly strict permitting requirements preclude bringing in additional overhead access lines, underground cables are saturated, and growth in power demand is highest. The power grid has never faced a challenge so great or so critical to our future productivity, economic growth, and quality of life. Incremental advances in existing grid technology are not capable of solving the urban power bottleneck. Revolutionary new solutions are needed ? the kind that come only from superconductivity...|$|E

50|$|Over {{a four-hour}} period on April 27, 2011 an {{automated}} SQL Injection attack {{occurred on the}} DSLReports website. The attack was able to extract 8% of the site's username/password pairs, which amounted to approximately 8,000 of the 9,000 active accounts and 90,000 old or inactive accounts created during the site's 10-year history. Once the intrusion was detected, stopped {{and the extent of}} the compromised accounts had been assessed, passwords for those accounts were <b>automatically</b> <b>reset.</b>|$|R
50|$|Then SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. {{believes}} this instance of use was unnecessary, and that market price levels had increased so much since circuit breakers were implemented {{that the point}} based system triggered a halt for a decline that was not considered a crisis. Some, like Robert R. Glauber, suggested {{in the aftermath of}} the circuit breaker tripping that trigger points be increased, and <b>automatically</b> <b>reset</b> by formula on an annual basis.|$|R
50|$|Another {{difference}} from the Fighting Fantasy books {{is the way that}} the protagonist's health is represented. Instead of having a stamina attribute which decreases as the character is injured, there are four simple stages to measure health: healthy, wounded, seriously wounded and dead. These are <b>automatically</b> <b>reset</b> after a battle. While seriously wounded a combatant is only allowed to add the roll of one die to their Might instead of two to reflect their weakened state.|$|R

There are {{two levels of}} enabling: the local (0,2,4,6) and global (1,3,5,7) levels. The local enable bits are <b>automatically</b> <b>reset</b> by the processor at every task switch to avoid unwanted breakpoint conditions in the new task. The global enable bits are not reset by a task switch; therefore, {{they can be used}} for conditions that are global to all tasks.|$|R

50|$|The {{cartridge}} {{is inserted}} into the console cartridge slot. If the cartridge is removed while the power is on, and the Game Boy does not <b>automatically</b> <b>reset,</b> the game freezes; the Game Boy may exhibit unexpected behavior, such as rows of zeros appearing on the screen, the sound remaining at the same pitch as was emitted the instant the game was pulled out, saved data may be corrupted, and hardware may be damaged. This applies to most video game consoles that use cartridges.|$|R
50|$|The first fault {{indicators}} came {{onto the}} market from Horstmann (Germany) in 1946. The E.O. Schweitzer Manufacturing Company (now {{a division of}} Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, Inc.) introduced a product to the U.S.A in 1948. The first fault indicators were manual reset devices. Later fault indicators <b>automatically</b> <b>reset</b> on system restoration or after a set period of time. More recent fault indicators communicate their status (tripped or reset) via cell signal or radio to a central station, handheld device, or pole-mounted receiver.|$|R
5000|$|The RSA II adapter's network port, by Default, {{is set to}} [...] "Try DHCP Server.

50|$|The Type 051 Retina Reflex IV {{was made}} from 1964 to 1967. It has a {{characteristic}} little window {{in the front of}} its pentaprism housing, which displays the aperture in use in the viewfinder. A hot shoe replaced the accessory shoe of the Reflex III. The frame counter now <b>automatically</b> <b>resets</b> to 36 when the back is opened; the frame advance slider is used to set the counter for shorter rolls. The split-image rangefinder on the ground glass is now at a 45 degree angle.|$|R
5000|$|A {{thermal fuse}} is a cutoff {{which uses a}} {{one-time}} fusible link. Unlike a thermal switch which may <b>automatically</b> <b>reset</b> itself when the temperature drops, the thermal fuse is more like an electrical fuse: a single-use device that cannot be reset and must be replaced when it fails or is triggered. A thermal fuse is used when the overheating {{is a result of}} a rare occurrence, such as failure requiring repair (which would also replace the fuse) or replacement at the end of service life.|$|R
5000|$|The M2 was {{considered}} to be a more affordable, simplified version of the 1954 Leica M3. Notably, the frame counter of the M2 was composed of a disk plate beneath the film advance lever that had to be manually reset to zero after reloading. This system was close to that of the Leica III series, and unlike that of the M3, which is an independent frame counter, visible through a window in the top plate, that <b>automatically</b> <b>resets</b> to zero when the film take-up spool is removed.|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} in-game controls, more tricks are {{possible}} while the player {{is on an}} MX motorcycle, but none can be performed while the player is controlling a Trophy Truck or Dune Buggy. Similar {{to the risk of}} being thrown off an ATV or motorcycle during the game, Trophy Trucks and Dune Buggies are vulnerable to rollovers, after which the player's vehicle will be <b>automatically</b> <b>reset</b> back on its wheels, as it is when thrown off of an ATV or motorcycle. The game also offers tutorials on how to drive Trophy Trucks and Dune Buggies.|$|R
5000|$|The FIWC online {{qualification}} {{takes place}} on PlayStation and Xbox Networks, and can be accessed through {{the latest version of}} EA Sports FIFA on Xbox One and PS4. The qualification runs for 3 seasons using FUT (FIFA Ultimate Team) [...] Each season the players with the most points in each region (Europe, Americas and Rest of the World) move onto their respective regional qualifier where they then compete {{to make it to the}} next round of the tournament. Points are <b>automatically</b> <b>reset</b> before a new season begins so players can decide to play in any amount of seasons they may wish.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{objective}} of E-Type is to cover as much distance {{as possible in}} the given time limit over various stages, avoiding static obstacles such as roadworks, oil slicks, trees and postboxes. If the car hits such an object both the driver and his blonde female passenger are thrown upwards from their seats, with the car's wheels falling off on their landing. The car is then <b>automatically</b> <b>reset</b> and moved to the centre of the road for the player to restart. Additionally, other cars can also be seen driving along the roads and need to be avoided - collisions here also add damage the car.|$|R
5000|$|Two Israelis, Aaron Friedman and Yehonatan Tsirolnik, {{have created}} an online clock timer, that <b>automatically</b> <b>resets</b> when Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel occur. The time counter on their website uses {{information}} from the IDF Home Front Command system and counts time up from the last Palestinian rocket attack on Israel. It displays how long Israel has been rocket free and shows the summed up total numbers of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel. [...] "Israel has been under non stop rocket attacks for years (..)

50|$|The {{preliminary}} {{report from the}} Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) identified that problems started 90 seconds before the eventual failure. The first line to trip was a 66 kV line near Adelaide, and it was <b>automatically</b> <b>reset.</b> The first major fault was 47 seconds later when two phases of the 275 kV line between Brinkworth and Templers grounded. The Davenport-Belalie line tripped with one phase to ground, was <b>automatically</b> <b>reset,</b> but tripped again nine seconds later, so was isolated for manual inspection, with the fault estimated to be 42 km from Davenport. One second later (7 seconds before the state went dark), the Hallett Wind Farm reduced output by 123 MW. Four seconds later, a third 275 kV transmission line showed a fault, the Davenport - Mount Lock {{is on the other}} side of the same towers as Davenport-Belalie, and the fault was estimated to be 1 km further on. The damaged power lines caused 5-6 voltage glitches which stressed the ride-through capability of most of the wind farm capacity, causing 9 of them to shut down: Finally, all within one second, the Hornsdale Wind Farm reduced output by 86 MW, Snowtown Wind Farm reduced output by 106MW, the Heywood interconnector flow increased to over 850 MW and both of its circuits tripped out due to the overload. Supply was then lost to the entire South Australian region of the National Electricity Market, as the Torrens Island Power Station, Ladbroke Grove Power Station, Murraylink interconnector and all remaining wind farms tripped.|$|R

40|$|Password leaks {{have been}} {{frequently}} reported in recent years, with big companies like Sony, Amazon, LinkedIn, and Walmart falling victim to breaches involving {{the release of}} customer information. Even though passwords are usually stored in a salted hash, attackers still guess passwords because of insecure password choices and password reuse. However, the adverse effects of a password breach can be mitigated by changing users' passwords. We introduce a simple yet powerful algorithm to reset user account passwords automatically, while still allowing users to authenticate without any additional effort on their part. We implemented our algorithm as a Firefox add-on that <b>automatically</b> <b>resets</b> a user's password when they log in to their account, and stores the new password in the built-in Firefox password manager...|$|R
