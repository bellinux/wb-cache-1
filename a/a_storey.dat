5|$|The west façade of {{the castle}} has square towers {{flanking}} the central bay, with others at the south west and north west, all topped with octagonal, machicolated turrets. The north and south façades are relatively simple. The east façade has a central projection in the centre rising <b>a</b> <b>storey</b> above the parapet, to form a tower. The tower's south angle is splayed to accommodate the main staircase and only the corbels of its parapet survive. The screen closing off the east entrance has a three-bay cusped arcade {{on the ground floor}} and three ogee arches on the shafts above.|$|E
25|$|Baker Street Mill {{is said to}} {{have been}} built in 1765, {{although}} a date of 1762 is recorded in the mill. The earliest firm reference for the mill is 1796, this from a sale notice in 1808. It is likely that the mill was raised <b>a</b> <b>storey</b> between 1762 and 1814. The mill was working by wind until 1914. A steam mill was built near the mill towards the end of its working life, a new boiler being supplied in 1906.|$|E
25|$|After Buckingham {{retired in}} 1676, Lady Charlotte Fitzroy, Charles II's daughter, moved in {{when she married}} Edward Lee, 1st Earl of Lichfield. The Crown {{authorised}} extensive rebuilding that included adding <b>a</b> <b>storey,</b> giving it three main floors, an attic and basement. This structure can be seen today as the rear section of Number 10. (See Plan of the Premises Granted to the Earl and Countess of Lichfield in 1677) The likely reason that repair was required is that the house had settled in the swampy ground near the Thames, causing structural damage. Like Downing Street, it rested on a shallow foundation, a design error that caused problems until 1960 when the modern Number 10 was rebuilt on deep pilings.|$|E

25|$|She {{is said to}} {{have added}} <b>a</b> <b>storey</b> to the old house {{although}} there is no evidence from the exterior to support this. Many additions have been made over the years, the church was built in 1840, the novitiate in 1863 and six years later St Joseph's wing which contains the concert hall and refectory. St Anthony's wing was erected in 1896, St Francis Xavier's in 1903 and the Lisieux building in 1932 for the accommodation of visiting prelates to the Eucharistic Congress. In the 1920s, novice Agnes Bojaxhiu (later to become Mother Teresa) came to Loreto Abbey to learn English. This was the language the Sisters of Loreto used to teach school children in India.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the caves}} {{originally}} had wooden porches or fore-temples built {{out from the}} cliff, {{but most of these}} have decayed or been lost in other ways, with only five remaining, the two earliest of which are rare surviving examples of Song dynasty wooden architecture. The most prominent wooden building at the site, first built during the Tang dynasty, housed a large Buddha and was originally 4 storeys high, but it has been repaired at least 5 times and is no longer the original structure. <b>A</b> <b>storey</b> was added between 874-885, then repaired in the Guiyijun period, and two further storeys were added during a restoration in 1898. Two further restorations were carried out in the 20th century, and the building is now a 9-storey structure.|$|E

A pair of underdrift millstones {{is located on the}} upper floor of the roundhouse, these were driven via a portable steam engine in times of calm. The roundhouse was originally built as a single-storey structure, it and the mill being raised <b>a</b> <b>storey</b> at a later date.|$|E

2500|$|The store rooms, work rooms, {{servants}} {{quarters and}} ancillary rooms {{were located in}} the basement. With a floor to ceiling height approaching 3m it allowed the rooms that faced the street to be lit by natural light {{without the need for}} a lightwell, and so the face of the building could be kept close {{to the back of the}} footpath. The passageway to the north of the building led to a roofed courtyard which served as a coach house and also ramped down half <b>a</b> <b>storey</b> to the level of the basement. Stairs led down from the passageway to the basement on the Wilhelmstraße side of the building to enable easy access for servants and the necessary deliveries. The adjacent western wing of the building housed the stables, tack and fodder rooms. Along Wilhelmstraße, the coachmen's and servants quarters were lit by low windows at street level. In the basement, directly under the vestibule was the servants' hall. The kitchen and its associated accommodation such as the scullery, pantries and wine cellar occupied the largest area in basement. A dumbwaiter carried meals up to the buffet beside the ballroom on the ground floor. In addition to the wine cellar, the boiler for the hot water heating was favourably located for both goods deliveries and the entrance to the servant's quarters. The wing along the southern boundary was occupied by the laundry. The washhouse with its washing machine [...] is evidence for the advanced technical sophistication the building was designed with in 1868. The grotto in the remaining corner of the southern wing was a remnant of the original garden before the great ballroom was built over the garden.|$|E

6000|$|... 9. I {{could not}} go sleep last night till past two, and was waked before three by a noise of people endeavouring to break open my window. For a while I would not stir, {{thinking}} it might be my imagination; but hearing the noise continued, I rose {{and went to the}} window, and then it ceased. I went to bed again, and heard it repeated more violently; then I rose and called up the house, and got a candle: the rogues had lifted up the sash a yard; there are great sheds before my windows, although my lodgings be <b>a</b> <b>storey</b> high; and if they get upon the sheds they are almost even with my window. We observed their track, and panes of glass fresh broken. The watchmen told us to-day they saw them, but could not catch them. They attacked others in the neighbourhood about the same time, and actually robbed a house in Suffolk Street, which is the next street but one to us. It is said they are seamen discharged from service. I went up to call my man, and found his bed empty; it seems he often lies abroad. I challenged him this morning as one of the robbers. He is a sad dog; and the minute I come to Ireland I will discard him. I have this day got double iron bars to every window in my dining-room and bed-chamber; and I hide my purse in my thread stocking between the bed's head and the wainscot. Lewis and I dined with an old Scotch friend, who brought the Duke of Douglas(17) and three or four more Scots upon us.|$|E
60|$|When {{he left me}} I went to my room. After {{a little}} while, not hearing any sound, I came out and went up the stone stair to where I could look out towards the South. There was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse, {{inaccessible}} though it was to me, {{as compared with the}} narrow darkness of the courtyard. Looking out on this, I felt that I was indeed in prison, and I seemed to want a breath of fresh air, though it were of the night. I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me. It is destroying my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of all sorts of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for my terrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out over the beautiful expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as day. In the soft light the distant hills became melted, and the shadows in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness. The mere beauty seemed to cheer me. There was peace and comfort in every breath I drew. As I leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving <b>a</b> <b>storey</b> below me, and somewhat to my left, where I imagined, from the order of the rooms, that the windows of the Count's own room would look out. The window at which I stood was tall and deep, stone-mullioned, and though weatherworn, was still complete. But it was evidently many a day since the case had been there. I drew back behind the stonework, and looked carefully out.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was born}} in the kingdom of Fife, being, by some five years, the younger of two sons of Archibald Leslie, of Pitcullo, near St. Andrews, a cadet of the great House of Rothes. My mother was an Englishwoman of the Debatable Land, <b>a</b> <b>Storey</b> of Netherby, and of me, in our country speech, it used to be said that I was [...] "a mother's bairn." [...] For I had ever my {{greatest}} joy in her, whom I lost ere I was sixteen years of age, and she in me: not that she favoured me unduly, for she was very just, but that, within ourselves, we each knew who was nearest to her heart. She was, indeed, a saintly woman, yet of a merry wit, and she had great pleasure in reading of books, and in romances. Being always, when I might, in her company, I became a clerk insensibly, and without labour I could early read and write, wherefore my father was minded to bring me up for a churchman. For this cause, I was some deal despised by others of my age, and, yet more, because from my mother I had caught the Southron trick of the tongue. They called me [...] "English Norman," [...] and many a battle I have fought on that quarrel, for I am as true a Scot as any, and I hated the English (my own mother's people though they were) for taking and holding captive our King, James I. of worthy memory. My fancy, like that of most boys, was all for the wars, and full of dreams concerning knights and ladies, dragons and enchanters, about which the other lads were fain enough to hear me tell what I had read in romances, though they mocked at me for reading. Yet they oft came ill speed with their jests, for my brother had taught me to use my hands: and to hold a sword I was instructed by our smith, who had been prentice to Harry Gow, the Burn-the- Wind of Perth, and the best man at his weapon in broad Scotland. From him I got many a trick of fence that served my turn later.|$|E
