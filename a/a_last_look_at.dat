500|$|While the Forerunner {{ships are}} being activated, Anders escapes through a {{teleportation}} device and is rescued. Cutter decides {{to destroy the}} Forerunner fleet rather than allow the Covenant to use it. Anders formulates a plan to detonate the ship's faster-than-light drive in the planet's sun, as the explosion would cause a supernova. Before they can prepare the reactor, Forge and the Spartans are ambushed by the Arbiter and his Elites. The Spartans dispatch the aliens and Forge kills the Arbiter. The reactor is damaged during the fight, necessitating a manual detonation. Forge volunteers for the suicidal task, telling the Spartans {{that they will be}} needed in the coming fight. The Spirit of Fire escapes just as Forge overloads the reactor, destroying the Forerunner fleet. Without its faster-than-light drive, the Spirit of Fire is left drifting in space. The crew enters cryonic sleep for long-term storage as Cutter takes <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Forge's empty cryonic tube. If the game is completed on the [...] "Legendary" [...] difficulty mode, Serina wakes Cutter and tells him that [...] "something has happened".|$|E
500|$|Trott {{retained}} the captaincy when Andrew Stoddart returned to Australia with his English team in 1897–98. Stoddart's team got {{away to a}} good start when they won the First Test in Sydney by [...] nine wickets, K. S. Ranjitsinhji scoring 175runs. With Joe Darling, Trott devised a plan to curb Ranjitsinhji's run scoring. [...] An exponent of the leg glance, [...] "Ranji" [...] would take <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the field before he took guard. [...] Taking advantage of this fact, after he took strike, the Australians deliberately weakened the off side with two men placed about [...] away from him. [...] Bowling a leg side line, the Australians aimed for a catch from a shot played to that side. Darling said of the plan, [...] "As soon as he had his last look and the bowler was at the point of delivering the ball, we shifted positions by a few yards, sometimes one way, sometimes the other. [...] Occasionally, only one would move and sometimes none would move. [...] This eventually put him clean off his game." [...] The English captain Archie MacLaren agreed saying, [...] "Ranji is in a blue funk". Regardless of the tactics, Ranji made 457runs at an average of 50.77 for the Test series.|$|E
60|$|Haley {{whipped up}} the horse, and, with <b>a</b> <b>last</b> sad <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the old place, Tom was whirled {{away to a}} town called Washington.|$|R
60|$|This he left {{lying on}} his desk where it could easily be seen. He tucked the bundle under his arm, and, with <b>a</b> <b>last</b> {{farewell}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the room, stole out.|$|R
60|$|We {{filled the}} three {{stockings}} hung {{by the great}} fireplace. Then, with <b>a</b> <b>last</b> lingering <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{the brightness of the}} tree, she stood in the doorway and turned the electric switch.|$|R
2500|$|The stone sculptures, in {{the outer}} vaulted corridors, are {{considered}} unique in Bagan. 1500 stone images (mostly unclear due to wear and tear) are seen inside the temple. The special images carved from a single rock (average size is [...] high, [...] broad and [...] thick) are those that depict 80 episodes from Buddha's life. Also seen are forty episodes from the last life of the Lord Buddha, beginning with an image of Setaketu Deva to Prince Siddhartha peeping through the tapestry for <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> his consort Yasodhara and his newborn son Rahula, {{before he left the}} palace for the life of recluse in the forest.|$|E
60|$|He {{then walked}} away smartly, with <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the besieged tower.|$|E
60|$|With {{that horrible}} confession--without even <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her--he left the room.|$|E
6000|$|... [With a wink {{that gives}} way, to <b>a</b> <b>last</b> fascinated <b>look</b> <b>at</b> LADY [...] WILLIAM, he passes out. All gaze after them, except THE PRESS, [...] who is tragically {{consulting}} his spiflicated notes.] ...|$|R
6000|$|And perhaps, Richard," [...] he concluded, with <b>a</b> <b>last</b> {{lingering}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the old pile as {{he turned}} his horses, [...] "perhaps some day, I shall remember what you told us at Brooks's." ...|$|R
60|$|But it {{occurred}} to Sir Terence that in the gloom the advantage might lie slightly with himself, since the other's superior sword-play would perhaps be partly neutralised. He cast <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> round <b>at</b> the dark windows.|$|R
60|$|I {{told him}} yes. That I {{had come for}} <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the old place before I left.|$|E

60|$|Benjamin stole <b>a</b> <b>last</b> bewildered <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{the object}} in the chair; bowed to it, with the {{instinct}} of politeness which never failed him; and (still with {{the air of a}} man in a dream) withdrew into the next room.|$|R
60|$|Unvanquished philosopher!

60|$|And the younger, {{influenced}} more by {{a certain}} mysterious shake of the head than by the words, slacked his bow cheerfully; and with <b>a</b> <b>last</b> wide-eyed <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the little gray bird that twittered and swung so fearlessly near them, the two boys went on with their hunting.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy took <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{the rising}} sun, and {{followed}} him close without replying. The lads were soon {{beyond the reach of}} daylight.|$|E

6000|$|He {{answered}} nothing, and the {{one thing}} for her to do was to go; and she did it. But it was only for a moment that she could be altogether the Grizel of old.

60|$|A {{minute or}} so longer Captain West strolled up and down, leaning easily {{into the face of}} this new and abominable gale or resting his back against it, and then he went below, pausing for a moment, his hand on the knob of the chart-room door, to cast <b>a</b> <b>last</b> {{measuring}} <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the storm-white sea and wrath-sombre sky he had mastered.|$|R
60|$|VALENTINE. No more mud on your carpet, Miss Susan; no more coverlets {{rolled into}} balls. A good riddance. Miss Phoebe, <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the garden.|$|E

60|$|In {{less than}} twenty minutes we had packed our trunk, locked up the house, {{and were in}} the stage, and, as we drove away, we cast <b>a</b> <b>last</b> admiring <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Euphemia's sign, slowly {{swinging}} in the wind. I would much {{like to know if}} it is swinging there yet. I feel certain there has been no lack of custom.|$|R
60|$|Billy {{watched him}} {{in silence for}} a moment. The truth of Bridge's {{statement}} of fact was so apparent that Billy was forced to accept the plan. A moment later he transferred the bags of loot to Bridge's pony, swung into the saddle, and took <b>a</b> <b>last</b> backward <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the diminishing figure of the man swinging along in the direction of Cuivaca.|$|R
60|$|Master Harry dresses himself quickly.

60|$|Accordingly, {{as soon as}} {{it became}} dark Dias went to the wall with Bertie. José, after <b>a</b> <b>last</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the mules, wrapped himself in a blanket and lay down.|$|E

6000|$|There {{was never}} a leaf on bush or tree, [...] 240 The bare boughs rattled shudderingly; The river was dumb and could not speak, [...] For the weaver Winter its shroud had spun; A single crow on the {{tree-top}} bleak [...] From his shining feathers shed off the cold sun; Again it was morning, but shrunk and cold, As if her veins were sapless and old, And she rose up decrepitly For <b>a</b> <b>last</b> dim <b>look</b> <b>at</b> earth and sea.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'd {{better go}} and see," [...] said the father, who now {{began to have}} some inkling of an idea why the two ladies were so anxious to carry his son off to Courcy Castle at this exact time. And so Frank had packed up his best clothes, given <b>a</b> <b>last</b> fond <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the new black horse, {{repeated}} his last special injunctions to Peter, and had then made one of the stately cortège which proceeded through the county from Greshamsbury to Courcy Castle.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} the horses had {{recovered}} breath and bent to their collars again. Jude, throwing <b>a</b> <b>last</b> adoring <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the distant halo, turned and walked beside his remarkably well-informed friend, who had no objection to telling him as they moved on more yet of the city--its towers and halls and churches. The waggon turned into a cross-road, whereupon Jude thanked the carter warmly for his information, and said he only wished he could talk half as well about Christminster as he.|$|R
