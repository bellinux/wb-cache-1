25|$|Boeing has marketed the C-17 to many European nations {{including}} Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. The Royal Air Force (RAF) {{has established}} an aim of having interoperability and some weapons and capabilities commonality with the USAF. The 1998 Strategic Defence Review identified {{a requirement for}} a strategic airlifter. The Short-Term Strategic Airlift (STSA) competition commenced in September of that year, however tendering was canceled in August 1999 with some bids identified by ministers as too expensive, including the Boeing/BAe C-17 bid, and others unsuitable. The project continued, with the C-17 seen as the favorite. In the light of Airbus A400M delays, the UK Secretary of State for Defence, Geoff Hoon, announced in May 2000 that the RAF would lease four C-17s at an annual cost of £100 million from Boeing for an initial seven years with an optional two-year extension. The RAF had the option to buy or return the aircraft to Boeing. The UK committed to upgrading its C-17s {{in line with the}} USAF so that if they were returned, the USAF could adopt them. The lease agreement restricted the operational use of the C-17s, meaning that the RAF could not use them for para-drop, airdrop, rough field, low-level operations and <b>air</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> refuelling.|$|E

2500|$|In 1954, {{standing}} up a 'new Mark IV' fighter squadron, progressing from an initial operating capability, having received its complement of aircrew, {{to a full}} operational capability required a change to a Mark III flying and training model. [...] First, flying practices to confirm that pilot/airborne interceptor integration was retained from No.3 OTU training, and learning the changes in Airborne Interception (AI) and Ground-Controlled Interception (GCI) tactics. The 'Guns Only' Conventional Pursuit Interception (flying Mark IIIs) was replaced with the Lead Collision Course (LCC) Attack (with 2.75-in Folding-Fin Aerial Rockets). The second stage began with a full night flying program, now with lights out interceptions (with fewer visual clues) and 'Bumping Heads'. The third stage of training saw gunnery practice at an air-to-ground range, both the [...]50 calibre guns and Mighty Mouse rockets at ranges near Winchester, south of Ottawa or Lac St. Pierre, near Sorel, Quebec. <b>Air</b> <b>to</b> <b>Air</b> (Towed) gunnery was practised on a range 'over' Lake Ontario, near RCAF Station Trenton.|$|E

[...] Its mission was to provide armament acquisition support. [...] Its support responsibilities included Advanced Medium-Range <b>Air</b> <b>to</b> <b>Air</b> Missile (AMRAAM), Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), Communications and Information Technology (C), Foreign Military Sales (FMS), and weaponeering.

2500|$|The Evolution Series {{locomotives}} {{are visually}} {{similar to the}} AC4400CW, although small differences are evident. [...] The most noticeable difference is the radiator section {{at the rear of}} the locomotive is larger to accommodate the GEVO's <b>Air</b> <b>to</b> <b>air</b> intercoolers. As with the AC6000CW the radiators project beyond the end of the hood, though not to the same extent, as the Evolution Series protrudes only a few inches out. Also, unlike previous GE locomotives, the grilles under the radiator are at two different angles. The increase in radiator size is due to the necessity for greater cooling capacity in the locomotive in order to reduce emissions. [...] The other major difference between the Evolution Series and earlier models are the vents below the radiators, which are larger than those on previous GE locomotives. In addition, most, if not all, Evolution Series units have air conditioners mounted below the cab on the conductor's side.|$|E
