This belief was confirmed by <b>a</b> first <b>round</b> <b>of</b> studies, seemingly disconfirmed by <b>a</b> second <b>round</b> <b>of</b> studies, reconfirmed by <b>a</b> third <b>round</b> <b>of</b> studies, leading to current studies seemingly supporting both conclusions. At each round, the hypothesis was refined, first to the idea that not all early childhood programs have long-term effect, only high-quality ones.|$|R
