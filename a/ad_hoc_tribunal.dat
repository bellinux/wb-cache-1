25|$|In October 2000, Komnas HAM {{released}} {{another report}} indicating that 23 individuals, including Sutrisno and Moerdani, {{should be investigated}} for their involvement; it called for an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>tribunal</b> {{to look into the}} matter further. With President Abdurrahman Wahid calling for further investigation and the impending tribunal, several military officials made contracts of forgiveness (islah) with victims' families; although the islah did not contain admissions of guilt, it did provide for victims to receive a lump sum of Rp. 1.5-2 million (US$200–250). The first islah covered 86 families, as represented by Rambe, while the second covered Biki's family; by 1 March 2001 a number of islah had been made. As a result of the islah, several victims or their families, suggested to investigator M.A. Rachman that charges be dropped. However, investigation continued, wrapping up in July 2003.|$|E

2500|$|In 1920, {{the brother}} of a student who had {{recently}} committed suicide brought evidence of ongoing homosexual activity among the students to the College's Acting Dean Chester N. Greenough. After consulting with Lowell and under his authority, the Dean convened an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>tribunal</b> of administrators to investigate the charges. It conducted more than 30 interviews behind closed doors and took action against eight students, a recent graduate, and an assistant professor. They were expelled or had their association with the university severed. Lowell proved particularly opposed to readmission {{for those who had}} been expelled only for associating too closely with those more directly involved. He eventually relented in two of four cases. The affair went unreported until 2002, when Harvard President Lawrence Summers called the affair [...] "part of a past that we have rightly left behind." ...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} {{the role played}} by the judges in creating the procedural rules which govern the functioning of the <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>Tribunals.</b> Noting that the bench had been tasked with devising its own rules of procedure and evidence, it queries whether judicial lawmaking in this context at the Tribunals has proven effective on the whole. It highlights the lack of transparency regarding the process of amending the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, and the possibility that this lawmaking power may undermine judicial independence and conceptions of the separation of powers. In considering possible lessons to be learned, the chapter asks whether the <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>Tribunals</b> may themselves have contravened international human rights law, most notably in relation to the mechanism allowing for provisional release...|$|R

25|$|After the Nuremberg and Tokyo {{trials of}} 1945-1946, the next {{international}} tribunal with jurisdiction over {{crimes against humanity}} was not established for another five decades. In response to atrocities committed in the 1990s, multiple <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>tribunals</b> were established with jurisdiction over crimes against humanity. The statutes of the International Criminal Court, the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugolavia and for Rwanda each contain different definitions of crimes against humanity.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the role that command responsibility currently plays in the case law of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). The <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>tribunals</b> rely in principle on a broad concept of command responsibility which {{can be applied to}} all superiors, including political and civilian ones. However, in practice, accused persons have only rarely been successfully charged under this form of liability. Indeed, recent case law has gradually adopted a rigorous approach with respect to the legal requirements of command responsibility. This has made it more difficult to establish criminal liability of superiors who have not directly participated in the commission of international offences. The <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>tribunals</b> have expressed an explicit preference for forms of ‘direct’ liability where the accused can be convicted both under ‘direct’ and command responsibility. While the ICTY and ICTR have progressively interpreted other international legal concepts to deal effectively with collective crimes com- mitted by leaders of organized groups, they seem to have confined command responsibility to international crimes perpetrated in typical military-like contexts...|$|R
40|$|This article explores to {{what extent}} the <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>tribunals</b> have made use of the {{national}} law of the state where the crimes have allegedly been committed in their quest for elements of crimes, concepts of criminal responsibility, grounds for excluding criminal responsibility and guidelines for sentencing. At first sight, one would expect the legislation of the territorial state to feature only as an indication of 'general principles of law' or 'international customary law'. However, the investigation of case law reveals that the law of the territorial state holds a far more prominent place. In search for rationales, the author suggests that, initially, national legislation has been used to plug the legal gaps in international criminal law. However, more recently the <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>tribunals</b> have canvassed the national legislation of the territorial state, in order to find out whether this state would qualify to take over criminal proceedings against mid-level perpetrators. The author suggests that the International Criminal Court might follow suit, in order to give shape to its policy of 'positive complementarity'...|$|R

In April 2011, after initial reticence, Senegal agreed to the creation of an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>tribunal</b> in collaboration with the African Union, the Chadian state and with international funding.|$|E

The ICSID was designed so that it cannot be reviewed by domestic courts which in theory makes it more enforceable. However, state immunity to lawsuits and judgments poses a barrier to collection.|$|E

50|$|Trinidad and Tobago {{asked the}} General Assembly in December 1989 to re-open the talks for the {{establishment}} of an international criminal court and in 1994 presented a draft Statute. The General Assembly created an <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> committee for the International Criminal Court and, after hearing the conclusions, a Preparatory Committee that worked for two years (1996-1998) on the draft. Meanwhile, the United Nations created the <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>tribunals</b> for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and for Rwanda (ICTR) using statutes—and amendments due to issues raised during pre-trial or trial stages of the proceedings—that are quite similar to the Rome Statute.|$|R

Following the March 1976 military coup, the military junta attempted to depose all the Supreme Court magistrates.

First explored are challenges posed by politics – that is, the need to secure cooperation from states and from the U. N.

40|$|The first {{judgment}} of the International Criminal Court has confirmed that article 25 (3) of the Rome Statute adopts the theory of control of the act to distinguish between principals and accessories. On the contrary, since 2003, the <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> tribunals’ case law bases the notion of co-perpetration on the Joint Criminal Enterprise doctrine, using a subjective criterion approach. In this article we will first analyze the problems raised by that case law of the <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>tribunals,</b> and then, we will study the article of the Rome Statute which apparently most resembles the Joint Criminal Enterprise doctrine: article 25 (3) (d). The article concludes {{that none of the}} three categories of that doctrine is included in the said provision...|$|R

50|$|Although {{evidence}} of sexual atrocities such as mass rapes is acknowledged in the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal and Tokyo Tribunal, references to sexual violence {{in their respective}} charter are absent. Nonetheless, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia (ICTY), the hybrid Special Court for Sierra Leone and the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia consider sexual violence as a public tool of war rather than a private crime. Groundbreaking case law both by the <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>Tribunals</b> of ICTR and ICTY established unprecedented developments by classifying acts of rape and sexual violence as crimes of genocide and crimes against humanity.|$|R

It is no coincidence, therefore, that plea bargaining provisions were not included in the Statutes nor in the Rules of Procedure and Evidence (RPE) of these courts and that the ICTY/ICTR judges initially rejected negotiated outcomes as incompatible with the broad and unique mandate of the Tribunals...|$|R
