Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny become big fans of the game. Meanwhile, scientists at the Center for Disease Control determine that sex addiction is a disease reaching epidemic proportions. They decide to screen schoolchildren for the disease, and Kenny, Kyle, and Butters are diagnosed as sex addicts. Kenny is killed after attempting autoerotic asphyxiation while in a Batman suit, while Kyle and Butters are sent to attend <b>a</b> <b>therapy</b> session for sex addicts consisting of Michael Douglas, Michael Jordan, Ben Roethlisberger, David Duchovny, Charlie Sheen, David Letterman, Bill Clinton, Billy Bob Thornton, Kobe Bryant, Eliot Spitzer, and Tiger Woods.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea for}} the film {{originated}} during <b>a</b> <b>therapy</b> session Lars von Trier attended during treatments for his depression. A therapist had told von Trier that depressive people tend to act more calmly than others under heavy pressure, because they already expect bad things to happen. Von Trier then developed the story not primarily as a disaster film, and without any ambition to portray astrophysics realistically, but {{as a way to}} examine the human psyche during a disaster.|$|E
25|$|Behaviorism {{developed}} in the 1920s, and behavior modification as <b>a</b> <b>therapy</b> became popularized in the 1950s and 1960s. Notable contributors were Joseph Wolpe in South Africa, M.B. Shipiro and Hans Eysenck in Britain, and John B. Watson and B.F. Skinner in the United States. Behavioral therapy approaches relied on principles of operant conditioning, classical conditioning and social learning theory to bring about therapeutic change in observable symptoms. The approach became commonly used for phobias, {{as well as other}} disorders.|$|E
5000|$|Shaw and Chalmers argued {{early on}} that [...] "If the {{clinician}} knows, or has good reason to believe, that <b>a</b> new <b>therapy</b> (<b>A)</b> is better than another therapy (B), he cannot participate in a comparative trial of <b>Therapy</b> <b>A</b> versus <b>Therapy</b> B. Ethically, the clinician is obligated to give <b>Therapy</b> <b>A</b> to each new patient with a need {{for one of these}} therapies." [...] Researchers would thus face an ethical dilemma if they wanted to continue the study and collect more evidence, but had compelling evidence that one of the tested therapies was superior. They further stated that any results should be withheld from the researchers during the trial until completion to avoid this ethical dilemma and ensure the study’s completion.|$|R

Given that the PA catheter is a monitoring tool and not <b>a</b> <b>therapy</b> {{in and of}} itself this is not entirely surprising. Justification for its continued use rests on a large body of clinical experience, disadvantages of other cardiac output monitoring systems, its ability to accurately measure pulmonary artery pressure, and the potential to use the catheter as a direct conduit for drug administration into the pulmonary artery.|$|E

25|$|Treatment {{of sleep}} apnea via a {{continuous}} positive airway pressure (CPAP) device has shown dramatic improvement in apnea and nearly complete resolution of RMD symptoms. Behavioral interventions may alleviate some RMD symptoms and movements. In such <b>a</b> <b>therapy,</b> sufferers {{are asked to}} perform RMD-like motions during the day in a slow and methodic manner. In such, patients come short of full rhythmic movements that they experience in sleep. Such behavioral training {{has been shown to}} carry over into sleep, and the forcefulness of the RMD movements is reduced or eliminated. Hypnosis and sleep restriction have been used in some cases to good effect.|$|E

The album's track listing was designed to resemble <b>a</b> <b>therapy</b> session, splitting the album between up-tempo tracks and ballads, reflecting conflicting emotions. Early sessions at Washington farm studio Bear Creek were poor and led the band to discard most of the recordings. The band regrouped without drummer William Goldsmith in early 1997 to record a second time at Hollywood's Grandmaster Recordings, with Grohl sitting in on drums instead. Goldsmith was offended and disgruntled {{that most of his}} material was re-recorded and left the band shortly thereafter.|$|E

25|$|Beginning with Bartlett's {{doctoral}} dissertation, whose doctoral jury {{members were}} French philosopher Paul Ricoeur (dissertation director), Belgian mathematical logician Jean Ladrière, and Belgian philosopher Alphonse de Waehlens, Bartlett developed {{an approach to}} the study of philosophical problems by means of <b>a</b> <b>therapy</b> for concepts. The approach took the form of a self-validating phenomenological epistemology whose purpose is the identification and correction of many conceptually self-undermining errors that Bartlett classified as conceptual pathologies. He applied the resulting methodology to a number of traditionally understood epistemological problems, as well as to portions of everyday, conventional conceptual vocabulary, to show that many of these must be recognized to be self-referentially inconsistent. He characterized the resulting methodology as self-validating {{in the sense that it}} cannot not be accepted without self-referential inconsistency.|$|E
