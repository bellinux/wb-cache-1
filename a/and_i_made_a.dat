25|$|At {{three o'clock}} p.m. on Monday at St. George's Mortuary, Dr. Blackwell <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> post mortem examination. Rigor mortis was still {{thoroughly}} marked. There was mud {{on the left}} side of the face and it was matted in the head. The body was fairly nourished. Over both shoulders, especially the right, and under the collarbone and in front of the chest there was a bluish discoloration, which I have watched and have seen on two occasions since.|$|E
25|$|Hulda Stumpf lay {{across the}} bed with a {{mattress}} doubled over her face. I was the second person to enter the room after the tragedy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> careful examination of her poor body. She had been brutally treated but was not, as the story was circulated, {{the victim of a}} bungling attempt at circumcision. That finally she had been strangled was evident by the large black and blue patches on her throat and neck. She was safe on the other side, but had had a rough passage.|$|E
500|$|Real Madrid {{eventually}} secured Robben's {{services in}} August 2007. He told Chelsea's official club website, [...] "It {{was difficult to}} leave because I {{had a great time}} in my three years at Chelsea <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> lot of friends. There was no time to say goodbye because the deal was closed on the Wednesday at 10 o'clock in the evening and the following morning I had to fly.|$|E

500|$|As I was {{reporting}} to the Triton, I remember saying, [...] "This ship is an unusual one. We've {{got to do something}} special with it. What could it be?" [...] We talked about it a little bit, and nobody had any ideas. Finally, I got an idea. We'll do a stunt. We'll go around the world from North Pole to South Pole. That was my brainstorm. If {{you take a look at}} a map of the world, you'll see that's not a very easy way to go. [...] So we didn't do that. But I do remember thinking of it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> speech to the crew, advising them of my thinking—that we were going to put this ship on the map. Well, that died out. Suddenly ... a phone call came, asking me if I could be in Washington tomorrow.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2007, claimed psychic John Edward {{appeared}} on Headline Prime, hosted by Glenn Beck. When {{asked if he}} would take Randi's challenge, Edward responded, [...] "It's funny. I was on Larry King Live once, and they asked me the same question. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> joke , and I'll say the same thing here: Why would I allow myself to be tested by somebody who's got an adjective as a first name?" [...] Beck simply allowed Edward to continue, ignoring the challenge.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the film}} release in November, Akhil Rajendra Dwivedi, a script writer, sued Bhansali for Rs. 20million {{alleging that the}} {{director}} used his script without informing him. Dwivedi claimed that he had registered his script, {{very similar to that}} of Guzaarish, in 2005 and had even met Bhansali in 2008. He alleged that the director had loved the script and said that he would get back to Dwivedi in a few weeks time. Dwivedi claimed that Bhansali never reverted and was unreachable for Dwivedi. Salman Khan, a close associate of Sanjay Leela Bhansali, in an award ceremony Super Idols, for felicitating specially abled people, by television channel IBN-7, took potshots at Guzaarish, hinting at its poor box office collection and said that [...] "Recently a movie released, Guzaarish, oops sorry! <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> movie on HIV/ AIDS, not even a dog came to watch the movie." [...] Later in the same event, he said to one of the winner of the awards, [...] "I will give you the number of Sanjay Leela Bhansali, you write it down, he has made Black, Khamoshi, made many pictures and made heaps of money but may be it won't come out, but it should come out." [...] The comments came as a shocker to many, since Salman was one of Bhansali's favorites and the lead actor in his first movie [...] and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. Bhansali reacted saying that [...] "If such an old and trusted friend can be so insensitive I don't {{want anything to do with}} the entertainment industry".|$|E

"So I {{went up to}} Brest, where I thought I {{might find}} some sort of steamer which might suit me, and in that harbor I did find an English steamer, which had {{discharged}} her cargo and was expectin' to sail again pretty much in ballast and brandy, so far as I could make out. I went to this vessel <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> offer to her captain to charter her for an excursion of one week--that was all I wanted.|$|R
2500|$|Chrétien {{revealed}} {{himself to}} be a staunch [...] "hard federalist" [...] favoring a strong federal government {{at the expense of the}} provinces, much along the same lines as his predecessor Trudeau. However unlike Trudeau, Chrétien supported the Charlottetown Accord of August 1992, which proposed devolving federal powers to the provinces and once again recognized Quebec as a [...] "distinct society". At the urging of Pelletier, Chrétien met secretly with Trudeau at the Royal York Hotel in Toronto, where the two men argued about the meaning of [...] "distinct society" [...] for more than two hours. While the two did not resolve their differences, Trudeau promised to refrain from undermining Chrétien's authority in public. Trudeau denounced the Accord at the Maison Egg Roll in Montreal on October 1, 1992. Chrétien had major reservations about the Charlottetown accord, but as his opposition to Meech had done him much damage in Quebec, he was anxious not to be seen as an opponent of another set of constitutional amendments designed to secure Quebec's ratification of the 1982 constitution, especially as Charlottetown was very similar to the amendments that Chrétien had proposed to Meech Lake in 1990. Chrétien endorsed the Charlottetown accord on the rather negative grounds that the constitutional debate of the late 1980s-early 1990s were destroying Canada, saying it [...] "was bleeding the nation to death" [...] and that Charlottetown was the best way of ending that debate in order to move political debate back to the economic recession, which had begun in 1990. At a Liberal caucus meeting on September 8, 1992, Chrétien declared that [...] "if we had been the government we would not have made this deal", and that only reason to support Charlottetown was that to reject it would increase support for Quebec separatism. [...] The unity minister Joe Clark recalled that Chrétien did not champion the Charlottetown accord in the 1992 referendum with any great conviction or passion, stating: [...] "We were trying to bring everybody into the tent on it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> practice taking proposals to the other party, particularly Chrétien...I just didn't think he was following the issue...I don't know what it was...But it left me with was the belief that here was a guy for whom the substance of things doesn't matter much." [...] During the 1992 referendum, Chrétien kept a low profile, and delivered only a few speeches in favor of Charlottetown.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm not a {{very clever}} sort of chap, you see. I somehow didn't seem able to grasp the workings. After about a year, my uncle, getting a bit fed-up, hoofed me out and got me a mastership at a school, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> hash of that. He got me one or two other jobs, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> hash of those." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Let me {{help you}} to look for it," [...] I said. So Sylvie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> 'voyage of discovery' among all the flowers; {{but there was no}} Baby to be seen.|$|E

60|$|When the men {{had been}} placed in the two {{vehicles}} in which the police had come, the Chief <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> examination of the premises, and we found that the house had been entered by a kitchen window, in exactly the manner which the tall burglar had described. Outside of this window, close to the wall, we found a leathern bag, containing what the Chief declared to be an excellent assortment of burglars' tools. The officers and their prisoners now drove away, and we were left to a long morning nap, if we were so fortunate as to get it, and a late breakfast.|$|R
60|$|Early in July, {{my friend}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> {{discovery}} {{in the wood}} of a very alarming and unexpected kind. We found {{a man in the}} clearing, prostrated by a dangerous wound, and to all appearance dead.|$|E

60|$|But the {{question}} was, {{how to do}} this. Indeed, {{there was only one}} way, to hang over the bend and discover what lay below. We read each other's thought without the need of words, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> motion as though I would start.|$|E
