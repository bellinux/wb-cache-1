25|$|Rotary swaging {{is usually}} a cold working process, used to reduce the diameter, produce <b>a</b> <b>taper,</b> or add a point to a round workpiece. It can also impart {{internal}} shapes in hollow workpieces {{through the use of}} a mandrel (the shape must have a constant cross-section). Swaging a bearing into a housing means either flaring its groove's lips onto the chamfer of the housing, or flaring the housing's material over the edge of the bearing. The flaring is done with a pair of rolls that travel around the hole and are fed down into the part, deforming the metal in a controlled, predicted way. Grease is often used to lubricate this swaging process, which is also called roller swaging.|$|E
25|$|The femoral {{component}} is the component that fits in the femur (thigh bone). Bone is removed and the femur is shaped {{to accept the}} femoral stem with attached prosthetic femoral head (ball). There {{are two types of}} fixation: cemented and uncemented. Cemented stems use acrylic bone cement to form a mantle between the stem and to the bone. Uncemented stems use friction, shape and surface coatings to stimulate bone to remodel and bond to the implant. Stems are made of multiple materials (titanium, cobalt chromium, stainless steel, and polymer composites) and they can be monolithic or modular. Modular components consist of different head dimensions and/or modular neck orientations; these attach via <b>a</b> <b>taper</b> similar to a Morse taper. These options allow for variability in leg length, offset and version. Femoral heads are made of metal or ceramic material. Metal heads, made of cobalt chromium for hardness, are machined to size and then polished to reduce wear of the socket liner. Ceramic heads are more smooth than polished metal heads, have a lower coefficient of friction than a cobalt chrome head, and in theory will wear down the socket liner more slowly. As of early 2011, follow-up studies in patients have not demonstrated significant reductions in wear rates between the various types of femoral heads on the market. Ceramic implants are more brittle and may break after being implanted.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{coronation}} day, a service of benediction (เจริญพระพุทธมนต์) {{will take place}} in all three sections of the Phra Maha Montien group of buildings. Depending on the king, the benediction service could be longer and can last over three days. The king will preside over these ceremonies himself from inside the Phaisan Thaksin hall. With the king is a chapter of thirty monks, with another forty-five monks inside the Chakkraphat Phiman residence. The king begins the ceremony by the lighting of candles. From these candles <b>a</b> <b>taper</b> is lit and given to the Supreme Patriarch of Thailand, who will proceed to the Amarin Winitchai throne hall to light a special candle called the Candle of Victory (เทียนชัย). This candle will stay lit until the end of {{the coronation}} ceremony. A senior monk will then read out a proclamation signalling the start of the coronation ceremonies. The entire assemblage of monks will chant the Paritta Suttas and lay a protective thread around the buildings to ward off evil spirits. The service concludes with the monks leaving the palace. They will return for the coronation service the next day. Before the end of the day the king will also send offerings of flowers to the Hindu deities in the Brahman temple, to the sacred white royal nine-tiered umbrellas (five dotted around the various palaces), and to the images of the guardian spirits of the capital city at the city shrine.|$|E

25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split collet to hold both the inlet and exhaust valves under constant valve spring pressure which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the top of each valve stem, the outer side of the collet halves are <b>a</b> <b>taper</b> fit into the spring retainer (also known as a collar), this taper locks the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the valve stem also locks the collet halves in place to the valve stem. To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the valve springs by exerting force on the spring retainer which allows the collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the retainer, spring and valve can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the valve spring compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and collets slightly. A slight sharp tap on the backside of the valve spring compressor above the valve stem should free the retainer allowing the springs to be compressed whilst retrieving the split collet. On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the valve stem whilst releasing the compressor, then as the spring retainer rises it locks the tapered split collets in place.|$|E
500|$|This was {{the third}} design by Robert Urie for the LSWR. The outline was made during the First World War, and {{incorporated}} {{lessons learned from the}} operation of his H15 class, a design that was to provide the basis for future standardisation on the LSWR. To economise on maintenance, the S15 class had interchangeable components that could be used on a similar design, the N15 class passenger locomotive, which had the same overall appearance. Details such as the boiler, the two-cylinders and valve gear were standardised between the classes, although <b>a</b> <b>taper</b> boiler was used on the S15 and N15 classes, as opposed to the parallel boiler of the H15 class. The only other major difference was the smaller diameter of the driving wheels. [...] Smaller diameter wheels gave better traction, essential for a fast freight locomotive.|$|E

500|$|Neither the Tu-4 nor the Tupolev Tu-80 {{were true}} {{intercontinental}} strategic bombers as they both lacked the range {{to attack the}} United States from bases in the Soviet Union and return. The Tu-85 was designed to achieve the necessary range by use of more powerful and fuel-efficient engines, a redesigned wing to increase the lift/drag ratio {{and the addition of}} more fuel.

500|$|The six {{finally agreed}} that Capper {{had to be}} removed from the house after Michelle Capper told them her {{stepfather}} was going to report her to the police as a missing person. In the early hours of 14 December 1992, Capper was forced into the boot of a stolen white Fiat Panda car and driven 15 miles (25 km) to a narrow lane at Werneth Low near Romiley, on the outskirts of Stockport. In the car were McNeilly, the Powells and Dudson. McNeilly [...] "giggled" [...] as they made the journey. Capper was pushed down an embankment into a patch of brambles and then McNeilly poured petrol over her. Powell stated: [...] "Suzanne was still wobbly and fell over. Bernie [...] said 'Get up.'

2500|$|Kroehl {{applied for}} a patent around March 1854 for a flange forming machine. [...] It is {{described}} in Scientific American as an improvement in machinery for bending flanges on wrought iron beams. [...] There {{is a pair of}} horizontal, and a pair of vertical rollers; the former pair has one roller with a face of the full depth of the beam, and the other has its face the depth of the beam minus the thickness of the flanges. [...] The vertical rollers are both alike, and are of a width a little greater than the extreme width of the flanges. [...] They are arranged opposite the space between the horizontal ones, and work in close contact with the sides of the roller. [...] In order to give the flanges and their beams, <b>a</b> <b>taper</b> or an elliptic, or other curved form, the vertical rollers have flanges, whose faces bear on the edges of the flanges of the beam, and cause the said rollers to receive such a movement in the direction of their axes, and apply such a force I that direction as bends the flanges of the beam to the desired form. [...] Kroehl secured the patent as #12,133 on January 2, 1855.|$|E
2500|$|Dies for {{bottle neck}} cases usually are {{supplied}} in sets {{of at least}} two dies, though sometimes a third is added for crimping. This is an extra operation and is not needed unless a gun's magazine or action design requires crimped ammunition for safe operation, such as autoloading firearms, where the cycling of the action may push the bullet back in the case, resulting in poor accuracy and increased pressures. [...] Crimping is also sometimes recommended to achieve full velocity for bullets, through increasing pressures so as to make powders burn more efficiently, and for heavy recoiling loads, to prevent bullets from moving under recoil. [...] For FMJ bullets mounted in bottle neck cases, roll crimping is generally not ever used unless a cannelure is present on the bullet, to prevent causing bullet deformation when crimping. [...] Rimless, straight wall cases, on the other hand, require <b>a</b> <b>taper</b> crimp, because they headspace on the case mouth; roll crimping causes headspacing problems on these cartridges. Rimmed, belted, or bottleneck cartridges, however, generally can safely be roll crimped when needed. Three dies are normally supplied for straight walled cases, with an optional fourth die for crimping. Crimps for straight wall cases may be taper crimps, suitable for rimless cartridges used in autoloaders, or roll crimps, which are best for rimmed cartridges such as are used in revolvers.|$|E

40|$|A normal-incident flattop laser with <b>a</b> <b>tapered</b> end is {{proposed}} as an optical undulator {{to achieve a}} high-gain and high-brightness X-ray free electron laser (FEL). The synchronic interaction of an electron bunch with the normal incident laser is realized by tilting the laser pulse front. The intensity of the flattop laser is kept constant during the interaction time of the electron bunch and the laser along the focal plane of a cylindrical lens. Optical shaping to generate the desired flattop pulse with <b>a</b> <b>tapered</b> end from <b>an</b> original Gaussian pulse distribution is designed and simulated. The flattop laser with <b>a</b> <b>tapered</b> end can enhance the X-ray FEL beyond the exponential growth saturation power by one order to reach 1 Gigawatt as compared to that without <b>a</b> <b>tapered</b> end.
