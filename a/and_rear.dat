5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} the directional stability of a bike is wheelbase, the horizontal {{distance between the}} ground contact points of the front <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> wheels. For a given displacement of the front wheel, due to some disturbance, {{the angle of the}} resulting path from the original is inversely proportional to wheelbase. Also, the radius of curvature for a given steer angle and lean angle is proportional to the wheelbase. Finally, the wheelbase increases when the bike is leaned and steered. In the extreme, when the lean angle is 90°, and the bike is steered in the direction of that lean, the wheelbase is increased by the radius of the front <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> wheels.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the forward}} <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> {{bulkhead}} was the bomb bay, which was constructed with a double-frame to strengthen it for carrying the bomb load. The {{space between the}} bomb bay <b>and</b> <b>rear</b> bulkhead was used up by Funkgerät radio equipment and contained the dorsal and flexible casemate ventral gunner positions. The rear bulkhead contained a hatch which allowed access {{into the rest of}} the fuselage which was held together by a series of stringers. The wing was a two spar design. The fuselage was formed of stringers to which the fuselage skin was riveted. Internally the frames were fixed only to the stringers, which made for simpler construction at the cost of some rigidity.|$|E

50|$|The US Army Corps of Engineers {{constructed}} the hatchery in 1973 to mitigate impacts to salmon spawning <b>and</b> <b>rearing</b> areas {{blocked by the}} construction of the Lost Creek, Applegate, and Elk Creek Dams (the latter was never constructed). The Hatchery was named in honor of Cole M. Rivers, a biologist on the Rogue River for 20 years. The facility is used for adult collection, spawning, egg incubation <b>and</b> <b>rearing</b> of spring chinook, coho, summer steelhead, and winter steelhead, and egg incubation <b>and</b> <b>rearing</b> of fall chinook and rainbow trout.|$|R
