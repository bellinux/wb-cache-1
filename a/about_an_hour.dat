The jury interpreted this as a sign that Webster had premeditated the murder and convicted her after deliberating for <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> and a quarter.|$|E

5|$|<b>About</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> after {{striking}} Long Island, Gloria {{made its}} final landfall in western Connecticut near Westport, {{and proceeded to}} move through New England while weakening. The NHC estimated that Gloria became extratropical over Maine early by 0000 UTC on September 28. The storm continued to the northeast through Atlantic Canada passing south of Greenland on September 30. The extratropical circulation of Gloria was last noted on October 2, although the remnants later affected Europe.|$|E
5|$|Adults of {{most species}} of mole cricket can fly powerfully, if not with agility, but males do so infrequently. The females {{typically}} take wing soon after sunset, and {{are attracted to}} areas where males are calling, which they do for <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> after sunset. This may be in order to mate, {{or they may be}} influenced by the suitability of the habitat for egg-laying, as demonstrated by the number of males present and calling in the vicinity.|$|E

5|$|<b>About</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> after Saratoga {{launched}} her airstrike, the Japanese launched theirs {{once they}} located the American carriers. Shōkaku contributed 18 D3As and nine Zeros while Zuikaku launched nine D3As and six Zeros. Reconnaissance SBDs from Enterprise spotted the 1st Carrier Division {{shortly after the}} Japanese airstrike had taken off and five of Shōkakus Zeros stayed behind {{to deal with the}} Dauntlesses as they attacked Shōkaku. The Dauntlesses survived the attack by the Zeros, but their spot report was garbled and the enemy's location could not be understood. This incident prompted Nagumo to launch a follow-on airstrike with 27 D3As and nine Zeros.|$|E

5|$|<b>About</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> after {{fragment}} K entered Jupiter, observers recorded auroral emission {{near the}} impact region, {{as well as}} at the antipode of the impact site with respect to Jupiter's strong magnetic field. The cause of these emissions was difficult to establish due to a lack of knowledge of Jupiter's internal magnetic field and of the geometry of the impact sites. One possible explanation was that upwardly accelerating shock waves from the impact accelerated charged particles enough to cause auroral emission, a phenomenon more typically associated with fast-moving solar wind particles striking a planetary atmosphere near a magnetic pole.|$|E
5|$|Hearing {{the shots}} from the {{northern}} side of the river, Forbes uneasily moved towards the southern bank, intending to cross and help Wilson. However, Forbes's fears of an ambush proved to be well-founded; at an opportune moment, the Matabele in the scrub opened fire, catching the column in the open. The ambushers' shots were initially wild and inaccurate, but they soon began to focus their fire on the exposed Maxim guns and horses, forcing the troopers to retreat to cover. Five Company soldiers were injured. The resulting skirmish lasted <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> by which time the Shangani had been severely swollen by heavy rains upstream, causing it to flood.|$|E

After being persuaded by Joey Mercury and Lars Frederiksen that he could only help wrestlers underappreciated by WWE (like himself) if he stayed, Punk signed a new contract with WWE <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> before capturing the WWE Championship from Cena, while the pay-per-view event was ongoing.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} April 25, 2011, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with the working title Group Hug. In June 2011, stuntman Jeremy Fitzgerald injured his head while attempting a stunt involving a 30-foot fall from a building after {{getting hit by}} an arrow. A Marvel spokesperson later told TMZ.com that despite the injury, Fitzgerald recovered and continued working on set. The following month, secondary filming took place <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the Butler area. A chase sequence was also shot in Worthington, Pennsylvania at Creekside Mushroom Farms, the world's largest single-site mushroom farm, which provided 150 miles of abandoned limestone tunnels 300 feet below the ground for filming.|$|E
5|$|The Georgia Emergency Management Agency alerted local {{hospitals}} {{to prepare for}} up to 100 casualties. A doctor at nearby Memorial Health hospital described patients arriving at an emergency triage as varying in condition from suffering minor burns to their hands to having received 80-90% burns, with many in critical condition, and one with 95% burns. The victims' ages ranged from 18 to 50. Many victims were placed in artificial comas because they were on life support systems. Eight were transported by helicopter to the specialized Joseph M. Still Burn Center in Augusta, Georgia, <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> away. Five of those injured later died there while receiving treatment.|$|E

5|$|The {{sea otter}} is diurnal. It has {{a period of}} {{foraging}} and eating in the morning, starting <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> before sunrise, then rests or sleeps in mid-day. Foraging resumes {{for a few hours}} in the afternoon and subsides before sunset, and a third foraging period may occur around midnight. Females with pups appear to be more inclined to feed at night. Observations of the amount of time a sea otter must spend each day foraging range from 24 to 60%, apparently depending on the availability of food in the area.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{trend toward}} {{increasing}} half-lives for the heavier isotopes; thus the heaviest three known isotopes, 267Sg, 269Sg, and 271Sg, are also the longest-lived, having half-lives in minutes. Some other isotopes in this region are predicted to have comparable or even longer half-lives, with the longest-lived predicted isotope being 272Sg {{which is expected to}} have a half-life of <b>about</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> Additionally, 263Sg, 265Sg, 265mSg, as well as the predicted 268Sg have or should have half-lives measured in seconds. All the remaining isotopes have half-lives measured in milliseconds, {{with the exception of the}} shortest-lived isotope, 261mSg, with a half-life of only 92microseconds.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completion}} of a major overhaul at the New York Naval Shipyard, Wisconsin headed south for refresher training in the Caribbean Sea, later taking part in another Springboard exercise.
