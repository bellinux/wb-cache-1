50|$|Risk assessment: Every entity faces {{a variety}} of risks from {{external}} and internal sources that must be assessed.

40|$|Abstract: The current {{technical}} {{history of}} nonbiased <b>assessment</b> <b>is</b> highlighted. Definitions {{of fairness and}} experts' attempts to alleviate problems associated with bios in <b>assessment</b> <b>are</b> reviewed. Factors relating to nonbiased <b>assessment</b> <b>are</b> emphasized that normally do not receive sufficient attention. Decisions currently made {{as a result of}} the <b>assessment</b> process <b>are</b> reviewed and an examination made of how decisions based on inappropriate evaluation can negate the validity of the assessment process. Finally, the utility of many recent efforts to resolve the problems of bias in <b>assessment</b> <b>is</b> questioned and it is suggested that very basic systematic changes are needed before real progress can be mode in reducing bias in assessment...|$|R
25|$|Functional {{assessment}} of behavior provides hypotheses about {{the relationships between}} specific environmental events and behaviors. Decades of research have established that both desirable and undesirable behaviors are learned and maintained through interactions with the social and physical environment. Functional behavior <b>assessments</b> <b>are</b> used to identify controlling variables for challenging behaviors {{as the basis for}} intervention efforts designed to decrease the occurrence of these behaviors.|$|E
25|$|Bayesian {{decision}} theory {{can be applied}} to all four areas of the marketing mix. <b>Assessments</b> <b>are</b> made by a decision maker on the probabilities of events that determine the profitability of alternative actions where the outcomes are uncertain. <b>Assessments</b> <b>are</b> also made for the profit (utility) for each possible combination of action and event. The decision maker can decide how much research, if any, needs to be conducted in order to investigate the consequences associated with the courses of action under evaluation. This is done before a final decision is made, but {{it should be noted that}} in order to do this costs would be incurred, time used and may overall be unreliable. For each possible action, expected profit can be computed, that is a weighted mean of the possible profits, the weights being the probabilities. The decision maker can then choose the action for which the expected profit is the highest. The theorem provides a formal reconciliation between judgment expressed quantitatively in the prior distribution and the statistical evidence of the experiment.|$|E

25|$|Dietary {{exposure}} <b>assessments</b> <b>are</b> often completed using {{models to}} simulate exposure. Once dietary consumption data, chemical residue data and any additional supplemental {{information has been}} compiled, one can utilize the data to model the dietary exposure {{of the population of}} interest to the chemical of interest.

These models can be designed specifically for an intended application or there are standard models available {{that can be used for}} dietary exposure assessments. Two existing models are detailed in the following sections.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{area of expertise}} for many clinical psychologists is psychological assessment, and {{there are indications that}} as many as 91% of psychologists engage in this core clinical practice. Such evaluation is usually done in service to gaining insight into and forming hypotheses about psychological or behavioral problems.

Methods include formal testing measures, interviews, reviewing past records, clinical observation, and physical examination.|$|E

30|$|The {{concept of}} <b>assessment</b> <b>is</b> also {{recognized}} in the pre-school core curriculum (Ojala, 2005).

25|$|Cradle-to-gate is an {{assessment}} of a partial product life cycle from resource extraction (cradle) to the factory gate (i.e., before it is transported to the consumer). The use phase and disposal phase of the product are omitted in this case. Cradle-to-gate <b>assessments</b> <b>are</b> sometimes the basis for environmental product declarations (EPD) termed business-to-business EDPs. One of the significant uses of the cradle-to-gate approach compiles the life cycle inventory (LCI) using cradle-to-gate. This allows the LCA to collect all of the impacts leading up to resources being purchased by the facility. They can then add the steps involved in their transport to plant and manufacture process to more easily produce their own cradle-to-gate values for their products.|$|E
25|$|The EPA has {{established}} guidance {{for assessing the}} cumulative risk for multiroute exposures to pesticide groups determined to have a common mechanism of toxicity. The Agency has also published guidance on determining whether chemicals share a common mechanism of toxicity, i.e., whether they can be assessed as a common mechanism group. The risk calculation is based on dose addition, where individual pesticide exposure levels are scaled by their relative potency and then summed. Some key uncertainties in this approach include the possibility that relative potency changes with dose, {{and the potential for}} toxicological interactions (dose addition assumes no toxicological interactions). Another caution is that the resulting risk <b>assessments</b> <b>are</b> not complete environmental health evaluations of all chemical exposures, but only represent risks from those common mechanism pesticides.|$|E
