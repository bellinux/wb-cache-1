5000|$|Although the {{collectivism}} of Eastern cultures {{creates a}} strong support {{system for the}} group, it produces many stressors {{that can lead to}} depression and anxiety. [...] For example, the overwhelming focus on the group rather than the individual can result in feelings of a lost individual identity and sense of self. Identity issues such as these are historically linked with depression. Moreover, many more rules and social norms exist in collective cultures than in individual cultures to maintain the harmony of the group. This combined with the cohesiveness of the group can make social mistakes very public and result in feelings of shame and embarrassment by the individual at fault. Research indicates that these feelings are associated with social anxiety within collectivistic societies. <b>A</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>mistake</b> that affects <b>an</b> individual’s reputation or results in the loss of honor has more severe consequences because of the stress associated with maintaining that honor.|$|R

Following the narrative of Truth Serum, it represents the happy beginning of the relationship, when Lo was [...] "really in love" [...] and [...] " [...] think straight". [...] "Paradise" [...] is a jungle and drum and bass song with electronic elements; it talks about the moment when Lo realizes that she needs and relies on her partner.

Among the blood components, PCs {{are responsible for the}} highest rates of bacterial contamination as well as septic transfusion reactions. We assessed antimicrobial susceptibility profile, resistance to methicillin (MRCoNS), and resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins of group B (MLSB) of 16 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) isolates from an investigation in 691 PCs bags. We then compared conventional and automated phenotypic methods, disc diffusion test (DD) and VITEK(r) 2, respectively as well as phenotypic and genotypic methods (Polymerase Chain Reaction - PCR). All CoNS were susceptible to vancomycin. The disc diffusion test characterized 18. 75 % as MRCoNS and 37. 5 % with inducible resistance to MLSB (iMLSB), and with VITEK(r) 2, 6. 3 % and 31. 25 %, respectively. The mecA gene was detected in 18. 75 % and the erm gene in 31. 25 % of the isolates. In this study, we found equal percentage values between presence of the mecA gene by PCR and resistance to methicillin using cefoxitin by DD test, evidence of the erm gene by PCR, and iMLSB resistance by automation (VITEK(r) 2).
