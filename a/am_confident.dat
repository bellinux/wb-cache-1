500|$|Rachid Chouhal was {{the oldest}} athlete to {{represent}} Malta at the London Games {{at the age of}} 37. He had not participated in any previous Olympic Games.

Before the Games Choudal said [...] "When I want something, I go for it. I am not afraid. I <b>am</b> <b>confident</b> in my training and am careful not to get hurt. I know that the level of the athletes competing in the 100 metre sprint is very high. My aim is to do a personal best or season's best." [...] He was drawn in the fourth heat of the preliminary round on 4 August, finishing fourth out of eight runners, with a time of 10.83 seconds. Chouhal ranked ahead of Tilak Ram Tharu of Nepal (10.85 seconds) and Masoud Azizi from Afghanistan (11.19 seconds) but behind the Saint Vincent and the Grenandines' Courtney Williams (10.80 seconds) in a heat led by Gérard Kobéané of Burkina Faso (10.42 seconds).

500|$|Berridge {{defended the}} family, saying that Tahil's {{departure}} {{caused a lot}} of problems, however, she added, [...] "he Ferreiras have not been as successful as we had hoped. I think in retrospect we made a mistake in giving their entrance such a fanfare as a New Asian Family. Viewers traditionally {{take a long time to}} adapt to anyone new [...] so it was wrong to emphasise what was different about this family from the start. Even so, we had a terrific first story for them, which was to have culminated in a huge, action storyline to mark the exit of their father. However, the sudden removal of actor Dalip Tahil, for reasons beyond our control, meant that the story had to be abandoned quickly – and 40 scripts rewritten on the spot. The result was the transplant story, which I have to admit did go on for far too long, especially when our biggest story in this period had also to be abandoned because of the pregnancy of Kacey Ainsworth. The writers and production team did their very best under these circumstances but I would be the first to admit the end result was not our finest hour. I hope that viewers will not hold this against the Ferreira family and will be prepared to watch the next stage of their stories with an open mind. This is a very talented bunch of actors, who've had to put up with a lot of stick for problems which have not been of their making. Viewer response to their lighter material was very favourable and I <b>am</b> <b>confident</b> the Ferreiras will regain their popularity." [...] Lorraine Heggessey, controller of BBC One, said the show became overdependent on the kidney transplant storyline as there were several cast problems, such as illness, pregnancy, rehab and a car crash. Berridge quit as executive producer of EastEnders and was replaced by Kathleen Hutchison.|$|E
500|$|Pakistani {{reactions}} to the US apology were different. [...] "We appreciate Secretary Clinton's statement, and hope that bilateral ties can move to a better place from here. I <b>am</b> <b>confident</b> that both countries can agree on many critical issues, especially on bringing peace to the region," [...] Pakistan's ambassador to the US Sherry Rehman said in a statement. In general the decision to reopen the supply routes was met in Pakistan with a general sense of befuddlement and muted criticism that the Pakistani government had given up a much-trumpeted increase in transit fees for NATO trucks. Opposition politicians criticised the move and demanded more of an explanation from the Pakistani government and military. [...] "Now government should let the people know about the terms and conditions for reopening the NATO supply lines. What were the demands?" [...] said former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi. And Enver Baig, an opposition politician belonging to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz complained about Americans: [...] "They did not apologize. They said ‘sorry.’" [...] Some Pakistani vowed civil disobedience to stop the convoys. [...] "The decision to reopen NATO supplies is a big crime against the country, {{and we will not}} sit silently over this," [...] retired Lt. Gen. Hamid Gul, a leader of the Defense Council of Pakistan (a coalition of Islamic parties that includes pro-Taliban clerics and other foes of the NATO routes) and a former chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence agency, told the Pakistani cable channel Express News. [...] "We will come to roads and streets and protest against the decision and will also try to stop the supplies." [...] Pakistani Taliban announced that they will attack any NATO supply trucks travelling along the routes. Transporters who resume supplies will be [...] "considered a friend of the U.S." [...] and will face the consequences, a spokesman for the militant group said. Al Jazeera's Kamal Hyder said that both NATO and Pakistani forces had taken into account losses in the past. [...] "The losses, {{despite the fact that they}} have become a problem are nowhere near the levels that would cause alarm bells to ring" [...] the correspondent said. According to his analysis it would cause a problem if [...] "the Pakistani Taliban attack bridges or decide to take these people head on in the tribal areas" [...] connecting Pakistan to the southern Afghan province of Kandahar.|$|E
