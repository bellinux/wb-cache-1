5|$|Microsoft Xbox 360 {{gained an}} early lead {{in terms of}} market share, largely due to its {{established}} Xbox Live online gaming system, and its early launch date, which was one year before its rivals. Sales in North America and Europe have continued to be strong, even {{after the release of}} the Wii and PlayStation 3. Like its predecessor, the Xbox 360 received <b>a</b> <b>muted</b> reception in Japan, attributed to the lack of content aimed at Japanese gamers.|$|E
5|$|The main {{call of the}} American white ibis is a honking sound, {{transcribed}} as urnk, urnk, or hunk, hunk. The call is used in flight, courtship or when disturbed. Birds also utter <b>a</b> <b>muted</b> huu-huu-huu call while foraging, {{and make}} a squealing call in courtship. Young in the nest give a high-pitched zziu as a begging call.|$|E
5|$|Gregson-Williams' {{score is}} darker {{to follow suit}} with the film. Gregson-Williams wanted Caspian's theme to convey a vulnerability, which would sound more vibrant as he became more heroic. It {{originally}} used a 3/4 time signature, but the opening scene required a 4/4 and thus it was changed. To represent Miraz's cunning, the heroic theme from the first film was inverted. For Reepicheep, <b>a</b> <b>muted</b> trumpet was used to present his militaristic and organised character. Gregson-Williams considered arranging his theme for a small pennywhistle, but found that it sounded too cute and broke the tension of the night raid.|$|E
25|$|Bass tone (tono bajo): {{played with}} the full palm on the head. It {{produces}} <b>a</b> low <b>muted</b> sound.|$|R
5000|$|The album has {{received}} mixed reviews with Musik-Express claimed the album 'liberates oft-heard standards from the corset of arbitrariness' with Intro adding 'Only <b>an</b> <b>muted</b> jazz trumpet and a distant double bass enrich the charged silence which often ends in unexpected slowness'. [...] Williams asserted on The Afterword podcast that 'I don't mind the different reactions that the album has got {{because it makes}} me feel like I'm doing something right.' ...|$|R

5|$|The ad {{opens on}} a young man {{dribbling}} in place. The music starts with a simple ostinato C–G–B–C line played by <b>a</b> <b>muted</b> synth bass. At 0:05, a young man wags his tongue while dribbling. This is a signature move of Jordan's. At 0:09, a player drives to the basket with his tongue hanging out. He recreates a moment from the 1991 NBA Finals, game 2: Jordan scored a layup after switching hands in midair to avoid Sam Perkins of the Los Angeles Lakers.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Bauer {{was asked}} by the Åhlén & Åkerlund {{publishing}} house (now Bonnier Group) to illustrate their new series of books, Among Gnomes and Trolls. The books would be published annually, and contain stories by prominent Swedish authors. The majority of Bauer's pictures for the book were full-page watercolor illustrations in <b>a</b> <b>muted</b> color scheme; he also contributed with covers, vignettes and other smaller illustrations. Bauer's most significant creatures, the trolls, were rendered in shades of gray, green, and brown, the colors of the forests, as if these beings had grown from the landscape itself. Due to the limitiations of the technology available to his printers, the 1907–10 editions were produced in just two colors: black and yellow. Some of Bauer's original paintings for these prints were in full color.|$|E
5|$|Initially given a blue color scheme, the TIE fighter {{models for}} the first film were grey to better film against a bluescreen; TIE fighters in The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983) shifted back to being <b>a</b> <b>muted</b> blue. Sound {{designer}} Ben Burtt created the distinctive TIE fighter sound effect by combining an elephant call with a car driving on wet pavement. Combat scenes between TIE fighters and the Millennium Falcon and Rebel Alliance X-wing fighters in Star Wars {{were meant to be}} reminiscent of World War II dogfight footage; editors used World War II air combat clips as placeholders while Industrial Light & Magic completed the movie's special effects. Darth Vader's distinct TIE advanced X1 in Star Wars was designed to make it instantly recognizable, and the TIE interceptors developed for Jedi were designed to look fast, deadly, and frightening.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} Japanese {{version of}} the game had <b>a</b> more <b>muted</b> color scheme, while more colorful backgrounds were added in the international releases {{at the request of}} publishers.|$|R
5|$|The male's song {{is a rich}} musical warbling, often {{ending in}} a loud high-pitched crescendo, which is given in bursts of up to 30seconds. The song is {{repeated}} for about two-and-a-half minutes, with a short pause before each repetition. In some geographically isolated areas, such as islands, peninsulas and valleys in the Alps, a simplified fluting song occurs, named the Leiern (drawling) song by the German ornithologists who first described it. The song's introduction is like that of other blackcaps, but the final warbling part is a simple alternation between two notes, as in a great tit's call but more fluting. The main song is confusable {{with that of the}} garden warbler, but it is slightly higher pitched than in that species, more broken into discrete song segments, and less mellow. Both species have a quiet subsong, <b>a</b> <b>muted</b> version of the full song, which is even more difficult to separate. The blackcap occasionally mimics the song of other birds, the most frequently copied including the garden warbler and the common nightingale. The main call is a hard tac-tac, like stones knocking together, and other vocalisations include a squeaking sweet alarm, and a low-pitched trill similar to that of a garden warbler.|$|E
25|$|The {{publication}} in March 2004 of issue #300 {{was met with}} <b>a</b> <b>muted,</b> rather than celebratory, response from the comics industry. Though Sim reports the print run for #300 was doubled from that of recent issues, that would still only come to around 16,000 copies, {{a far cry from}} the series' high of 37,000 copies.|$|E
25|$|Dressed {{in black}} and set against <b>a</b> <b>muted</b> green background, the sisters are seen in a doorway. Bessie stands in front, her arms down and hands clasped in front of her. Clara stands {{directly}} behind, and wraps her left hand around Bessie's waist while resting her upraised right hand on the entryway's frame. The sisters are noble in comportment and remote in expression. The unusual positioning of their figures implies a complex and intimate relationship.|$|E
50|$|Two {{special edition}} CV8-R Monaros were released: the first, in a grey colour; the second, in <b>a</b> more <b>muted</b> red. Each had special edition wheels and other {{distinguishing}} features.|$|R

25|$|Marimba bars {{produce their}} fullest sound when struck just off center, while {{striking}} {{the bar in}} the center produces a more articulate tone. On chromatic marimbas, the accidentals (black keys) can also be played on {{the space between the}} front edge of the bar and its node (the place where the string goes through the bar) if necessary. Playing on the node produces a sonically weak tone, and the technique is only used when the player or composer is looking for <b>a</b> <b>muted</b> sound from the instrument.|$|E
25|$|This bond has {{alternating}} {{stretching and}} heading courses, with the headers centred over {{the midpoint of}} the stretchers, and perpends in each alternate course aligned. Queen closers appear as the second brick, and the penultimate brick in heading courses. <b>A</b> <b>muted</b> colour scheme for occasional headers is sometimes used in English bond to lend a subtle texture to the brickwork. Examples of such schemes include blue-grey headers among otherwise red bricks—seen in the south of England—and light brown headers in a dark brown wall, more often found in parts of the north of England.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} both {{feedback}} from the employer and self-efficacy (belief in one's capabilities to achieve a goal) within the employee must be present for goal-setting to be effective. However, because of the tunnel vision focus created by goal-setting theory, several studies have shown this motivational theory may not be applicable in all situations. In fact, in tasks that require creative on-the-spot improvising, goal-setting can even be counterproductive. Furthermore, because clear goal specificity is essential to a properly designed goal-setting task, multiple goals can create confusion for the employee and {{the end result is}} <b>a</b> <b>muted</b> overall drive. Despite its flaws, Goal-setting Theory is arguably the most dominant theory in the field of I–O psychology; over one thousand articles and reviews published in just over thirty years.|$|E
5000|$|Diphlebia lestoides is a large, solid-looking damselfly; {{the male}} is a blue to grey colour with black markings, while the female has <b>a</b> more <b>muted</b> colouring. It sits with its white marked wings spread out.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} backs {{the factory}} fence and {{is embedded in}} a meadow adorned with cherry trees. Claes Oldenburg's prominent sculpture Balancing Tools provides a colourful contrast, while Tadao Ando's nearby conference pavilion gives <b>a</b> more <b>muted</b> one.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, Jay Chou {{released}} his second directorial film, a musical drama titled The Rooftop. It generated <b>a</b> more <b>muted</b> response compared to his directorial debut, {{the box office}} receipts in mainland China, {{on the other hand}} were positive.|$|R
25|$|In {{his first}} week in Ireland Essex mounted a lavish pageant of English chivalry during the Garter Feast at Dublin on St George's Day, April 23. It was a pointed display of the values he felt were ignored at Elizabeth's Court. In London the Queen had chosen <b>a</b> <b>muted</b> {{version of the same}} ceremony, owing to the hardships of the war, and on hearing the reports from Dublin she granted the {{valuable}} mastership of wards to Cecil rather than the Earl. There was more humiliation for Essex when he rode north to Drogheda to inspect the famous 1,200 strong Flanders regiment, now commanded by Arthur Chichester. Essex charged the parading troops with his mounted staff, but they chose not to see the joke and stood firm, forcing him to pull his horse back as he was pricked in the backside with a pike.|$|E
25|$|Kenneth Callahan (1905–1986) was an American {{painter and}} muralist {{who served as}} a {{catalyst}} for Northwest artists in the mid-20th century through his own painting, his work as assistant director and curator at the Seattle Art Museum, and his writings about contemporary art. Born in Eastern Washington and largely self-taught as an artist, Callahan was committed to an art that went beyond the merely illustrative. He enrolled at the University of Washington in 1924 but did not stay long. He traveled widely, absorbing influences from the different countries and cultures he experienced. His talent was recognized early; his work was included in the first Whitney Biennial exhibition in 1933 and he went on to a distinguished painting career. Callahan is identified as one of the Northwest Mystics – along with Guy Anderson, Morris Graves, and Mark Tobey, who shared <b>a</b> <b>muted</b> palette and strong interest in Asian aesthetics.|$|E
25|$|This {{building}} {{was designed by}} Coltman and built in 1937 to house {{the headquarters of the}} Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited in Malaysia, and is a masterpiece of the Art Deco style. Located at the junction of Jalan Hang Kasturi and Leboh Pasar Besar (just behind the Central Market), it has the advantage of double frontage. The three-storey building follows the curve of the road. Unlike other Art Deco facades, the corner of the building is not accentuated due to the recessed entrance and the regularly spaced windows that flow across the facade. At one end is a tapering stepped pylon with a flagpole on top. <b>A</b> <b>muted</b> mosaic panel runs up the centre of the pylon. It included underground parking for bicycles. Internally, an interesting feature is an old elevator with brass and wood fittings and an oversized round window. The main OCBC Bank branch is now newly located at Jalan Tun Perak.|$|E
5000|$|Diphlebia nymphoides is a large, solid-looking damselfly; {{the adult}} male is a {{brilliant}} blue colour with a black and blue striped tail, while the female has <b>a</b> more <b>muted</b> colouring. It sits with its lightly tinted wings spread out.|$|R
50|$|The second {{movement}} {{shifts to}} a different expressive world. A simple ternary form with a cadenza-AB (cadenza) A, the B section represents an acoustic departure as the chromatic figurations in the left hand, originating in section <b>A,</b> are <b>muted.</b>|$|R
50|$|Kuhn's {{work was}} {{influential}} for rhetoricians, sociologists, and historians (and, in <b>a</b> more <b>muted</b> way, philosophers) {{for the development}} of a rhetorical perspective. His view on perception, concept acquisition and language suggest, according to Paul Hoyningen-Huene's analysis of Kuhn's philosophy, a cognitive perspective.|$|R
500|$|Fox Searchlight Pictures {{distributed}} Black Swan {{and gave}} the film a production budget of $10–12 million. Principal photography was achieved using Super 16 mm cameras and began in New York City {{toward the end of}} 2009. Part of filming took place at the Performing Arts Center at State University of New York at Purchase. Aronofsky filmed Black Swan with <b>a</b> <b>muted</b> palette and a grainy style, which he intended to be similar to The Wrestler. Aronofsky said ...|$|E
500|$|Mendes {{collaborated with}} costume {{designer}} Albert Wolsky, production designer Dennis Gassner, and cinematographer Conrad Hall {{to design the}} film's style. Wolsky designed costumes that were [...] "very controlled, with soft outlines and very soft silhouettes". Gassner built sets that could capture the cold look of the era. Mendes sought <b>a</b> <b>muted</b> palette for the film, having dark backgrounds and sets with dark, muted greens and grays. Mendes filmed Road to Perdition using the Super 35 format.|$|E
500|$|His piano music—not {{just that}} which is {{designated}} as symphonic—often strives to emulate the sounds of instruments other than the piano, as is evident from score markings such as [...] "quasi organo pieno" [...] (like a full organ), [...] "pizzicato" [...] and [...] "quasi tuba con sordino" [...] (like <b>a</b> <b>muted</b> tuba). In this respect, Alkan was a key source of inspiration; Sorabji admired his [...] "orchestral" [...] writing for the piano and was influenced by his Concerto for Solo Piano and his Symphony for Solo Piano.|$|E
50|$|Models in {{this line}} were the 'Heritage', 'Heritage-Deluxe', and later the 'Heritage III'. In each case, the basic design {{was the same as}} the Futura’s. Differences {{included}} keys that were flatter (similar to the Royal Quiet DeLuxe) and <b>a</b> more <b>muted</b> range of color availability.|$|R

5000|$|Reception of “The Easter People” was {{overwhelmed}} by the decision by Pope John Paul II {{at about the same}} time to make the first ever papal visit to Britain. Combined with the Pope’s own conservative policies, this ensured that “The Easter People” had only <b>a</b> very <b>muted</b> impact.|$|R
