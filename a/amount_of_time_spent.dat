5|$|Primarily a nocturnal grazer, the bohor reedbuck {{may also}} feed at daytime. A {{study showed that}} feeding peaked at dawn and late afternoon. In the night, two feeding peaks were {{observed}} once again: at dusk and midnight. They traverse {{a long way from}} their daytime refuges while grazing. Seasonal differences in the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> while grazing in a particular area is possibly related to the availability and quality of grasses there. The bohor reedbuck often grazes in association with other grazers such as hartebeest, topi, puku and kob. In Kenyan farmlands, the reedbuck may feed on growing wheat and cereals.|$|E
5|$|The FMCSA is a {{division}} of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), which is generally responsible for enforcement of FMCSA regulations. The driver of a CMV is required to keep a record of working hours using a log book, outlining the total number of hours spent driving and resting, as well as the time at which the change of duty status occurred. In lieu of a log book, a motor carrier may keep track of a driver's hours using Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs), which automatically record the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> driving the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|As older {{problems}} are solved, more complexities are being introduced, like adding additional parts to an engine. Interaction {{of these new}} parts, or niches, create emergent properties, like time-saving office devices (e.g. email, mobile computers, etc.) make communication more efficient but also expand the network of contacts and increase the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> on such duties. Homer-Dixon relates this to complexity theory explaining that as new niches are filled there is a synergistic burst of simplicity. However, this {{can also lead to}} less control or freedom as emergent properties are created, like a new government program leading to a sprawling bureaucracy. Information theory is touched upon relating the amount of information required to describe a system and the degree of that system's complexity. Chaos theory is used to describe how small changes can lead to widely varying results and path dependence.|$|E

5|$|Bliege Bird et al. {{observed}} turtle {{hunting and}} spear fishing patterns in a Meriam {{community in the}} Torres Strait of Australia, publishing their findings in 2001. Here, only some Meriam men were able to accumulate high caloric gains for the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> turtle hunting or spear fishing (reaching a threshold measured in kcal/h). Since a daily catch of fish is carried home by hand and turtles are frequently served at large feasts, {{members of the community}} know which men most reliably brought them turtle meat and fish. Thus, turtle hunting qualifies as a costly signal. Furthermore, turtle hunting and spear fishing are actually less productive (in kcal/h) than foraging for shellfish, where success depends only on the amount of time dedicated to searching, so shellfish foraging is a poor signal of skill or strength. This suggests that energetic gains are not the primary reason men take part in turtle hunting and spear fishing. A follow-up study found that successful Meriam hunters do experience greater social benefits and reproductive success than less skilled hunters.|$|E
5|$|According to {{director}} Hajime Tanigawa, its gameplay {{was based}} around prevalent South Korean online role-playing games for PC. Tanigawa joined when the title shifted {{to being an}} MMORPG, and he estimated development time in this form at ten months. At the beginning of development, the team decided to release a working form of the game within a year. This was managed by narrowing the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> on the early concept work, instead taking inspiration directly from other titles, including titles within the Megami Tensei series: Tanigawa said that without this, development might have lasted up to three years. When the closed beta began, many of the game's final functions {{had yet to be}} implemented. A free-to-play model was adopted as the team wanted to bring in the maximum number of players into the game. While making the game completely free and using in-game advertising as a means of earning money was an option, this had yet to become commercially viable in Japan at the time. In early 2007, CAVE partnered with Gung Ho Online Entertainment, a Japanese company experienced with online games who could co-manage the game with CAVE. According to Tanigawa, the partnership with Gung Ho Online opened up the possibility of expansion into Asian and Western markets.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the known}} {{associations}} between screen-based sedentary behaviors and childhood obesity, the mechanism behind the associations is still unclear. Given the increasing <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> children <b>spent</b> with computer, research regarding {{the effects of}} computer use on children 2 ̆ 7 s diet can have significant impact on public health. We examined the association between computer use among low-income, ethnically diverse 4 th to 5 th grade elementary school students and their diet behaviors. Secondary data obtained from the Quest to Lava Mountain Study (QTLM), from self-report questionnaires, as well as 24 -hour dietary recall were used. We {{examined the relationship between}} dietary pattern and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> children <b>spent</b> on computer, as well as the type of computer activities, while considering known and suspected confounders in these relationships. Results from multivariate logistic regression showed that the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> children <b>spent</b> on computer is inversely associated with fiber intake. Trends were observed for the relationship between computer activities and food consumption. Additional studies will need to be carried out to further explore this finding. Majority of the children did not adhere to the dietary guidelines for most nutrients and food groups, with particularly low intakes being observed for calcium, vitamin D, fiber and vegetables, regardless <b>of</b> the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> they <b>spent</b> on computer.

40|$|Abstract Background Electronic {{documentation}} handling {{may facilitate}} information flows {{in health care}} settings to support better coordination of care among Health Care Providers (HCPs), but evidence is limited. Methods that accurately depict changes to the workflows of HCPs are needed to assess whether {{the introduction of a}} Critical Care clinical Information System (CCIS) to two Intensive Care Units (ICUs) represents a positive step for patient care. To evaluate a previously described method <b>of</b> quantifying <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> and interruptions encountered by HCPs working in two ICUs. Methods Observers used PDAs running the Work Observation Method By Activity Timing (WOMBAT) software to record the tasks performed by HCPs in advance of the introduction of a Critical Care clinical Information System (CCIS) to quantify <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> on tasks and interruptions encountered by HCPs in ICUs. Results We report the percentages <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> on each task category, and the rates of interruptions observed for physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, and unit clerks. Compared with previously published data from Australian hospital wards, interdisciplinary information sharing and communication in ICUs explain higher proportions <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>spent</b> on professional communication and documentation by nurses and physicians, as well as more frequent interruptions which are often followed by professional communication tasks. Conclusions Critical care workloads include requirements for timely information sharing and communication and explain the differences we observed between the two datasets. The data presented here further validate the WOMBAT method, and support plans to compare workflows before and after the introduction of electronic documentation methods in ICUs. </p...|$|R
