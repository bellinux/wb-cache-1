Road Transport Informatics (RTI) services have specific requirements which are not met sufficiently by existing communication systems like RDS/TMC or GSM. Therefore, CEPT has assigned a one GHz band between 63 and 64 GHz {{for the development of}} a dedicated short-range communication system. Real-time constraints and specific functional requirements imply a reduced OSI architecture. In this paper we develop a lightweight architecture for short-range communication in RTI environments. We focus on the application layer concept, which will be the crucial design issue for RTI services. 1. INTRODUCTION Data communication will be a key technology for future road traffic concepts.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we model a toll-station {{terminal}} logon process of an electronic <b>fee</b> <b>collection</b> system {{as used in}} the German toll collection system. Currently, approximately 734, 000 vehicles participate in this electronic <b>fee</b> <b>collection</b> (EFC) system and up to nine million users are estimated to use a future Europe-wide solution. Thus, a clear view on traffic characteristics and performance of this large-scale, distributed telematics system are paramount for the overall architecture, parameterisation, and operation. Especially, reactions to downtime and recovery conditions must not result in an overload situation which could eventually lead to a total failure of the system. We describe the German toll collection system, detail the manual logon process, and, present a detailed system model. Then, we evaluate by simulation the process of delivering booking data records, which are stored in the terminals during a downtime of the central data centre, after system recovery. Finally, we compare different algorithms for sending data records during this phase regarding {{the time needed to}} deliver all queued records as well as regarding the load on the servers in the data centre.

50|$|The Irrigation Management Transfer Program (IMTP) started {{formally}} in {{the mid-1980s}} and continues until today. IMTP aims at decentralizing operation and maintenance, and <b>fee</b> <b>collection</b> responsibilities among others to the Juntas de Regantes (Water Users Irrigation Boards - WUB). To this date, 17 main WUBs have been formed and the operation of 11 systems has been formally transferred to them. WUBs have a total membership of about 30,000 users. According to the FAO, some of the achievements of IMTP includes: (i) reduced conflicts between the authority and water users, (ii) improved service, and (iii) higher <b>fee</b> <b>collection</b> (an increase from 20% of total charges, when managed by National Institute for Water Resources to almost 80% on their own). However, these results are far from ideal. For example, overall cost recovery continues to be low hence O&M costs still depend on government subsidies.|$|R

This diploma thesis in its theoretical part deals with electronic toll systems in general and shows how the system works in chosen countries of Europe. Special focus is on Czech toll system, its implementation and evaluation of its economic contributions year after year. From this point of view, the Czech system works fully. In practical part, the focus is on widening of the system functionality. At this moment, the on board units works only as a tool for collecting fees. However, thanks to combination of microwave and satellite system, the on board unit could become also a very intelligent tool for collecting of telematic data...|$|R

The findings indicate that farmers, who cultivate rice only, have the least capacity to pay the fee. However, other farmers, who cultivate rice and cash crops or only cash-crop, are able to pay the fee and 11 times higher than current ISF charged. The study also confirms that ISF paid farmers actually line closely to the total average ISF.
