500|$|A {{total of}} 121 bird {{species have been}} {{observed}} in the park, with twenty-six of them being considered of conservation priority. The area hosts fifteen raptor species and populations of bird species with limited distribution in Greece, such as the hazel grouse, Tengmalm's owl, wallcreeper and willow tit. The two bird communities that inhabit the subalpine and forest ecosystems are considered among the most complete in Greece: The first community includes species that nest and feed in the subalpine area, like the alpine chough, shore lark, western rock nuthatch and <b>alpine</b> <b>swift,</b> while the second comprises birds of prey like the griffon vulture, Egyptian vulture, peregrine falcon and common kestrel, that search for food in a wider zone.|$|E
500|$|Along with Ohiya, Pattipola and Ambewela, Horton Plains forms {{one of the}} Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in Sri Lanka. Together {{with the}} {{adjacent}} Peak Wilderness Sanctuary, Horton Plains contains 21 bird species which occur only on Sri Lanka. Four, Sri Lanka blue magpie, dull-blue flycatcher, Sri Lanka white-eye, and Sri Lanka wood pigeon, occur only in Horton plains, while other endemic species [...] include Sri Lanka spurfowl, Sri Lanka junglefowl, yellow-fronted barbet, orange-billed babbler, Sri Lanka bush warbler, and Sri Lanka whistling-thrush. Many birds migrate here in winter including swiftlets, and <b>alpine</b> <b>swift.</b> Crested serpent eagle, mountain hawk-eagle, black-winged kite, and peregrine falcon are among the birds of prey found in Horton Plains. Harriers are among the migratory raptors. This is a key wildlife area. All six highland endemic birds are found here, including dull-blue flycatcher, Sri Lanka white-eye, Sri Lanka wood pigeon, and Sri Lanka bush warbler. Yellow-eared bulbul and black-throated munia are widespread throughout the highlands.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alpine</b> <b>swifts</b> {{spend most}} of their lives in the air, living on the insects they catch in their beaks. They drink on the wing, but roost on {{vertical}} cliffs or walls. A study published in 2013 showed <b>Alpine</b> <b>swifts</b> can spend over six months flying without having to land. All vital physiological processes, including sleep, can be performed while on air.|$|R
50|$|<b>Alpine</b> <b>swifts</b> {{breed in}} {{mountains}} from southern Europe to the Himalaya. Like common swifts, they are strongly migratory, and winter much further south in southern Africa.|$|R

500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, <b>alpine</b> <b>swift,</b> red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|E

The assessment of geographical variation in the diet was complicated by the great variability among the individual supplies of prey. Prey size varied between 1. 3 and 29. 6 mm, differing significantly in the median prey size of the three populations (5. 12 - 8. 81 mm) according to the intraspecific variation in size of <b>alpine</b> <b>swifts.</b> In an interspecific comparison, prey size correlated positively with body size in seven species of swifts.

50|$|<b>Alpine</b> <b>swifts</b> {{are readily}} {{distinguished}} from the common swifts by their larger size and their white belly and throat. They are around twice as big as most other swifts in its range, about 20 to 23 cm in length, with a wingspan of 57 cm and a weight of around 100 g. They're largely dark brown in colour, with white patches underneath the beak and on the breast that are separated by a dark brown streak. Juveniles are similar to adults, but their feathers are pale edged.|$|R
50|$|<b>Alpine</b> <b>swifts</b> {{breed in}} {{mountains}} from southern Europe to the Himalaya. Like common swifts, they are strongly migratory, and winter much further south in southern Africa. They wander widely on migration, and are regularly seen {{in much of}} southern Europe and Asia. The species {{seems to have been}} much more widespread during the last ice age, with a large colony breeding, for example in the Late Pleistocene Cave No 16, Bulgaria, around 18,000-40,000 years ago. The same situation has been found for Komarowa Cave near Częstochowa, Poland during a period about 20,000-40,000 years ago.|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of the {{quantitative}} genetics {{of resistance to}} parasitism is key to appraise host evolutionary responses to parasite selection. Here, we studied effects of common origin (i. e. genetic and pre-hatching parental effects) and common rearing environment (i. e. post-hatching parental effects and other environment effects) on variance in ectoparasite load in nestling <b>Alpine</b> <b>swifts</b> (Apus melba). This colonial bird is intensely parasitized by blood sucking louse-flies that impair nestling development and survival. By cross-fostering half of the hatchlings between pairs of nests, we show strong significant effect of common rearing environment on variance (90. 7 % in 2002 and 90. 9 % in 2003) {{in the number of}} louse-flies per nestling and no significant effect of common origin on variance in the number of louse-flies per nestling. In contrast, significant effects of common origin were found for all the nestling morphological traits (i. e. body mass, wing length, tail length, fork length and sternum length) under investigation. Hence, our study suggests that genetic and pre-hatching parental effects play little role in the distribution of parasites among nestling <b>Alpine</b> <b>swifts,</b> and thus that nestlings have only limited scope for evolutionary responses against parasites. Our results highlight the need to take into consideration environmental factors, including the evolution of post-hatching parental effects such as nest sanitation, in our understanding of host-parasite relationships...|$|R

40|$|Despite accumulating {{evidence}} from {{in vitro studies}} that cellular senescence is linked to telomere dynamics, how this relates to whole-organism senescence and longevity is poorly understood and controversial. Using data on telomere length in red blood cells and long-term survival from wild <b>Alpine</b> <b>swifts</b> {{of a range of}} ages, we report that the telomere length and the rate of telomere loss are predictive of life expectancy, and that slow erosion of relatively long telomeres is associated with the highest survival probabilities. Importantly, because telomere dynamics, rather than chronological age, predict life expectancy, our study provides good evidence for a mechanistic link between telomere erosion and reduced organism longevity under natural conditions, chronological age itself possibly not becoming a significant predictor until very old ages beyond those in our sample...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method {{for the analysis}} of capture-recapture data. Previous methods have employed deterministic or partially stochastic models of the population under study; the new method not only provides a fully stochastic model, but it also allows death-rates to depend upon both current time and the health and age of the separate individuals. The numerical analysis associated with the method is, however, heavy, and can only be recommended when one wants to extract the maximum amount of information from data which have required much effort or time to collect. The method is illustrated by an estimation of the death-rate of <b>Alpine</b> <b>Swifts</b> (Apus melba) in the wild state. Some thirty years having been spent in collecting these data, it does not seem disproportionate to have spent several months in computing the results. The larger part of this calculation was done on ordinary desk calculators. Some unusual problems in maximum-likelihood estimation are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Aggregation of Crataerina melbae flies on {{breeding}} adult <b>alpine</b> <b>swifts</b> (Apus melba) was low {{when compared}} with other host-parasite systems and varied with sampling date, year, and sex of the flies. Generalized linear models were performed to ascertain which factors, extrinsic and/or intrinsic to the host, explained variability {{in the number of}} louse flies present on a single host, i. e., abundance. Overall abundance was unrelated to any host characteristic but varied slightly among years. Abundance of female flies varied among years, but also with date of sampling, the number of females increasing as the breeding season advanced. In contrast, abundance of males decreased as the season progressed, independently of host characteristics. Despite these different patterns, the number of flies of each sex on a given host was strongly intercorrelated. These results suggest that mate attraction may explain aggregation patterns in this louse fly species. Overall sex ratio of louse flies did not differ from unity. However, the proportion of males decreased during the breeding season, {{as a consequence of the}} opposite sex-related seasonal patterns in parasite abundance. Sex-ratio variability was not related to host characteristics or to infrapopulation sizes. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

50|$|Tachymarptis is a genus of bird in {{the swift}} family, Apodidae. It {{contains}} the <b>Alpine</b> <b>swift</b> (Tachymarptis melba) of Eurasia and Africa and the mottled swift (Tachymarptis aequatorialis) of Africa. They are large swifts with relatively broad wings, a large head, a medium-length forked tail and white in the underparts. They are often included in the genus Apus but they are larger than other members of that genus, their nestlings have a different foot structure and they host different species of feather lice. A recent study of mitochondrial and nuclear markers supports the separation of Tachymarptis and Apus. The name Tachymarptis comes from Greek takhus ("fast") and marptis ("seizer").|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} done in 2011 and 2012 was to {{identify}} the number of breeding bird species, to provide population estimates {{as well as to}} evaluate the conservational importance of Škocjan Caves Park for birds. Common bird species were surveyed using the territory mapping method. Rare species and nocturnally active species were surveyed using species-specific methods: observation, the playback method and the line transect method. 81 species were registered, 49 of which bred within the boundaries of the Park. The most abundant breeding species were Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla (260 - 320 breeding pairs), Robin Erithacus rubecula (250 - 310 breeding pairs), Blackbird Turdus merula (230 - 280 breeding pairs), Chaffinch Fringilla coelebs (230 - 280 breeding pairs) and Marsh Tit Poecile palustris (200 - 240 breeding pairs). Qualifying species for the Special Protected Area (SPA) Kras (SI 5000023) also bred within the Park: Peregrine Falcon Falco peregrinus, Nightjar Caprimulgus europaeus, Scops Owl Otus scops and Woodlark Lululla arborea. Eagle Owl Bubo bubo was also registered, but breeding attempts during the study period were unsuccessful due to the negative influence of several factors. One of the largest colonies of <b>Alpine</b> <b>Swifts</b> Apus melba, a rare and localized species in Slovenia, is also of conservation concern...|$|R
