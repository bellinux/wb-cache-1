They also accused him of ceding half the country to the communists. The communists had already captured more than half the country on the battlefield, and Diệm claimed he had no choice, but Diệm's campaign portrayed him as incompetent and unwilling to take the blame.|$|E

5|$|Carroll Baker (born May 28, 1931) is {{a retired}} American actress of film, stage, and television. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Baker's range of roles from naive ingénues to brash and {{flamboyant}} women established her as both a serious dramatic actress and a pin-up. After studying under Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio, Baker began performing on Broadway in 1954, where she was recruited by director Elia Kazan to play {{the lead in the}} film of Tennessee Williams's Baby Doll (1956). Her role in the film as <b>a</b> <b>sexually</b> repressed Southern bride earned her BAFTA and Academy Award nominations for Best Actress, as well as a Golden Globe award for Most Promising Newcomer that year.|$|E

5|$|Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine {{documented}} their {{encounters with}} the endangered animals on their conservation travels for the BBC programme Last Chance to See. The book by the same name, published in 1990, included pictures of a captive specimen, a male named Qi Qi (淇淇) that lived in the Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology dolphinarium from 1980 to July 14, 2002. Discovered by a fisherman in Dongting Lake, he became the sole resident of the Baiji Dolphinarium (白鱀豚水族馆) beside East Lake. <b>A</b> <b>sexually</b> mature female was captured in late 1995, but died after half a year in 1996 when the Shishou Tian-e-Zhou Baiji Semi-natural Reserve (石首半自然白鱀豚保护区), which had contained only finless porpoises since 1990, was flooded.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} of Batesian-Wallacian mimicry, {{the model is}} <b>a</b> <b>sexually</b> {{receptive}} female, which provides a strong attractive effect on males. Some spiders use chemical rather than visual means to ensnare prey. Female bolas spiders of the genus Mastophora lure male moth-flies (Diptera, true flies, but resembling moths) by producing analogues of the moth species' sex pheromones. Each species of spider appears to specialize in a particular species of prey in the family Psychodidae. Juveniles use their front pair of legs to capture prey, such as flies. Older spiders use a different strategy however, swinging a sticky ball known as a bolas suspended by a silk thread at moths. But both old and juvenile are able to lure prey via this olfactory signal; even young spiderlings {{have been shown to}} attract prey species.|$|E
5|$|Sarcoscypha dudleyi, {{commonly}} known as the crimson cup or the scarlet cup, is a species of fungus in the Sarcoscyphaceae family of the Pezizales order. In addition to its main distribution in the central to eastern United States, the fungus has also been recorded once in Bulgaria. It has been frequently confused with Sarcoscypha coccinea, but can be distinguished from this and other related species in Sarcoscypha by differences in microscopic characteristics, such as the presence and number of oil droplets in the spores. The species Molliardiomyces dudleyi is an imperfect form of the fungus that lacks <b>a</b> <b>sexually</b> reproductive stage in its life cycle.|$|E

5|$|Severe C. maculatus, infestations {{can affect}} 100% of the stored peas and cause up to 60% grain loss {{within a few}} months. The weevil {{generally}} enters the cowpea pod through holes pre-harvest and lays eggs on the dry seed. The larvae burrow {{their way into the}} seed, feeding on the endosperm. The weevil develops into <b>a</b> <b>sexually</b> mature adult within the seed. An individual bruchid will lay 20–40 eggs, and in optimal conditions each egg can develop into a reproductively active adult in 3 weeks. The most common methods of protection involve the use of insecticides, the main pesticides used being carbomates, synthetic pyrethoids and organophosphates.|$|E
5|$|The {{saprobic}} fungus {{grows on}} decaying sticks and branches in damp spots on forest floors, generally buried under leaf litter {{or in the}} soil. The cup-shaped fruit bodies are usually produced during the cooler months of winter and early spring. The brilliant red interior of the cups—from which both the common and scientific names are derived—contrasts with the lighter-colored exterior. The edibility of the fruit bodies is not clearly established, but its small size, tough texture and insubstantial fruitings would dissuade most people from collecting for the table. The fungus has been used medicinally by the Oneida Indians, and also as a colorful component of table decorations in England. Molliardiomyces eucoccinea is the name given to the imperfect form of the fungus that lacks <b>a</b> <b>sexually</b> reproductive stage in its life cycle.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving into}} Hollyoaks, Mercedes meets Russ Owen (Stuart Manning) and flirts with him, angering his girlfriend, Sophie Burton (Connie Powney). Mercedes {{develops}} feelings for Russ {{and they have}} sex. They begin a relationship after Sophie dies. Russ is diagnosed with <b>a</b> <b>sexually</b> transmitted infection and wrongly accuses Mercedes of having an affair. She is angry with Russ and sleeps with Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas). Mercedes discovers that her mother, Myra (Nicole Barber-Lane), {{is the cause of}} infection and Russ apologieses to Mercedes. Mercedes sleeps with Warren once again and feeling guilty, proposes marriage to Russ. He agrees, revealing that he was also going to propose. On the night before their wedding, Mercedes becomes intoxicated and has sex with Warren for a third time. On the same night, someone attempts to murder Clare Cunningham (Gemma Bissix) and Warren is arrested. Warren tries to prove his innocence as he was with Mercedes, but she denies it. At the wedding, Louise Summers (Roxanne McKee) interrupts the proceedings and confronts Mercedes. Mercedes' half-sister, Tina (Leah Hackett), lies and gives her an alibi. Mercedes and Russ then marry and Warren is charged with Clare's attempted murder. Mercedes agrees to be a witness at Warren's trial and explains their affair, with Russ listening on. Russ then ends their relationship.|$|E

HIV/AIDS incidences are 3-4 times higher since the growth of prison populations. Many prisons also lack a pre-screening process for incarcerated women. Another survey of 188 women showed {{that more than half}} reported a history of gynecological infection, particularly yeast infections. 57.9% of STD cases were found in non-white women. The male condom (74.1%), birth control pills (66.5%), withdrawal (38.9%), and the Depo-Provera injection (24.3%) were the most common methods of contraception.|$|R
