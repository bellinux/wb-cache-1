500|$|Madonna {{released}} {{more than}} eight remixes of the song in different formats. At the time, [...] "Secret" [...] was experiencing success on the US record charts, to keep the song current in dance clubs, Madonna requested remixes of the song from Junior Vasquez, who was a DJ at the Sound Factory nightclub in New York. According to him Madonna's representatives [...] "sent me a cassette of the song, just {{to get an idea}} what the song was... nd when it was 100 beats per minute I said, 'Oh god, what am I gonna do with this?'" [...] Vasquez and his team of engineers first experimented with the track by making remixes closer to the original version. Then he used only Madonna's vocals for the mixed versions, and re-wrote and composed the music as brand new. He was sure of doing house mixes of the track but had to [...] "speed-up" [...] Madonna's vocals. Recording engineer Dennis Mitchell explained, [...] "To do that we have to digitally manipulate her vocals, which is time compression... It just digitally goes in and snipes out tiny little digital slices of the actual sound <b>and</b> <b>squeezes</b> it together so that her tempo is a new tempo but her pitch stays the same." [...] According to Vasquez, Madonna was [...] "on top of everything" [...] including the house mixes {{as well as the other}} mixes created.|$|E

40|$|After {{beginning}} with a short historical review {{of the concept of}} displaced (coherent) <b>and</b> <b>squeezed</b> states, we discuss previous (often forgotten) work on displaced <b>and</b> <b>squeezed</b> number states. Next, we obtain the most general displaced <b>and</b> <b>squeezed</b> number states. We do this in both the functional and operator (Fock) formalisms, thereby demonstrating the necessary equivalence. We then obtain the time-dependent expectation values, uncertainties, wave-functions, and probability densities. In conclusion, there is a discussion on the possibility of experimentally observing these states. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{perform a}} {{detailed}} analysis of the behavior of coherent <b>and</b> <b>squeezed</b> states undergoing time evolution. We calculate time dependence of expectation values of position and momentum in coherent <b>and</b> <b>squeezed</b> states (which can be interpreted as quantum trajectories in coherent <b>and</b> <b>squeezed</b> states) <b>and</b> examine how coherence <b>and</b> <b>squeezing</b> is affected during time development, calculating time dependence of position and momentum uncertainty. We focus our investigations on two quantum systems. First we consider quantum linear system with Hamiltonian quadratic in $q$ and $p$ variables. As the second system we consider the simplest quantum nonlinear system with Hamiltonian quartic in $q$ and $p$ variables. We calculate the explicit formulas for the time development of expectation values and uncertainties of position and momentum in an initial coherent state. Comment: 13 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

60|$|My {{mother was}} very still and calm, hardly {{shedding}} a tear, but her whole demeanour {{was as if}} life were over for her, and {{she had nothing to}} do save to wait. She seemed to care very little for tendernesses or attentions on our part. No doubt she would have been more desolate without them, but we always had a baffled feeling, as though our affection were contrasted with her perfect union with her husband. Yet they had been a singularly undemonstrative couple; I never saw a kiss pass between them, except as greeting or farewell before or after a journey; and if my mother could not use the terms papa or your father, she always said, 'Mr. Winslow.' There was a large gathering at the funeral, including Mr. Fordyce, but he slept at Hillside, and we scarcely saw him--only for a few kind words <b>and</b> <b>squeezes</b> of the hand.

60|$|And now began {{a combat}} of wondrous ferocity and rare conditions. The combatants were unequally matched, {{for the man}} was huge and muscular, while the youth was undeveloped and slender, but what the latter lacked in brute force was counterbalanced {{by the weight of}} his armour, his {{youthful}} agility, and his indomitable pluck. By a deft movement of his legs he caused Bill to come down on his back, and fell upon him with all his weight plus that of the Crusader. Annoyed at this, and desperately anxious to escape before the house should be alarmed, Bill delivered a roundabout blow with his practised fist that ought to have driven in the skull of his opponent, but it only scarified the man's knuckles on the Crusader's helmet. He tried another on the ribs, but the folds of chain-mail rendered that abortive. Then the burglar essayed strangulation, but there again the folds of mail foiled him.

60|$|Another facetious anecdote, {{the last}} of those I had from a well- {{informed}} gentleman residing at Cairo, whose name (as many copies of this book {{that is to be}} will be in the circulating libraries there) I cannot, for obvious reasons, mention. The revenues of the country come into the august treasury through the means of farmers, to whom the districts are let out, and who are personally answerable for their quota of the taxation. This practice involves an intolerable deal of tyranny and extortion {{on the part of those}} engaged to levy the taxes, and creates a corresponding duplicity among the fellahs, who are not only wretchedly poor among themselves, but whose object is to appear still more poor, and guard their money from their rapacious overseers. Thus the Orient is much maligned; but everybody cheats there: that is a melancholy fact. The Pasha robs and cheats the merchants; knows that the overseer robs him, and bides his time, until he makes him disgorge by the application of the tremendous bastinado; the overseer robs <b>and</b> <b>squeezes</b> the labourer; and the poverty-stricken devil cheats and robs in return; and so the government moves in a happy cycle of roguery.|$|E

The validity of the semiclassical theory is examined in the squeezed vacuum state in the oscillatory phase of the inflaton. The semiclassical theory in the oscillatory phase of the non-classical inflaton holds only if the associated squeezing parameter is much less compared to unity. Quantum fluctuations of the inflaton is also examined in coherent <b>and</b> <b>squeezed</b> state formalisms. ...|$|R

60|$|Nine {{times out}} of ten a man's broad-mindedness is {{necessarily}} the narrowest thing about him. This is not particularly paradoxical; it is, {{when we come to}} think of it, quite inevitable. His vision of his own village may really be full of varieties; and even his vision of his own nation may have a rough resemblance to the reality. But his vision of the world is probably smaller than the world. His vision of the universe is certainly much smaller than the universe. Hence he is never so inadequate as when he is universal; he is never so limited as when he generalises. This is the fallacy in the many modern attempts at a creedless creed, at something variously described as essential Christianity or undenominational religion or a world faith to embrace all the faiths in the world. It is that every sectarian is more sectarian in his unsectarianism than he is in his sect. The emancipation of a Baptist is a very Baptist emancipation. The charity of a Buddhist is a very Buddhist charity, and very different from Christian charity. When a philosophy embraces everything it generally squeezes everything, <b>and</b> <b>squeezes</b> it out of shape; when it digests it necessarily assimilates. When a theosophist absorbs Christianity it is rather as a cannibal absorbs Christian missionaries. In this sense it is even possible for the larger thing to be swallowed by the smaller; and for men to move about not only in a Clapham sect but in a Clapham cosmos under Clapham moon and stars.|$|E

6000|$|The ridges, as {{was shown}} in the diagram (Plate 3) of the palm of the hand, run athwart the fingers in rudely {{parallel}} lines {{up to the last}} joint, and {{if it were not for}} the finger-nail, would apparently continue parallel up to the extreme finger-tip. But the presence of the nail disturbs their parallelism <b>and</b> <b>squeezes</b> them downwards on both sides of the finger. (See Fig. 8, ~2~.) Consequently, the ridges that run close to the tip are greatly arched, those that successively follow are gradually less arched until, in some cases, all signs of the arch disappear at about the level of the first joint (Fig. 8, ~1~). Usually, however, this gradual transition from an arch to a straight line fails to be carried out, causing a break in the orderly sequence, and a consequent interspace (Fig. 8, ~2~). The topmost boundary of the interspace is formed by the lowermost arch, and its lowermost boundary by the topmost straight ridge. But an equally large number of ducts exist within the interspace, as are to be found in adjacent areas of equal size, whose mouths require to be supported and connected. This is effected by the interpolation of an independent system of ridges arranged in loops (Fig. 8, ~3~; also Plate 5, Fig. 9, a, f), or in scrolls (Fig. 8, ~4~; also Fig. 9, g, h), and this interpolated system forms the [...] "pattern." [...] Now the existence of an interspace implies the divergence of two previously adjacent ridges (Fig. 8, ~2~), in order to embrace it. Just in front of the place where the divergence begins, and before the sweep of the pattern is reached, there are usually one or more very short cross-ridges. Their effect is to complete the enclosure of the minute triangular plot in question. Where there is a plot on both sides of the finger, the line that connects them (Fig. 8, ~4~) serves as a base line whereby the pattern may be oriented, and the position of any point roughly charted. Where there is a plot on only one side of the finger (Fig. 8, ~3~), the pattern has almost necessarily an axis, which serves for orientation, and the pattern can still be charted, though on a different principle, by dropping a perpendicular from the plot on to the axis, in the way there shown.|$|E
