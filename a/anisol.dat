40|$|Amorphous {{and long}} range ordered cubic and {{hexagonal}} silica impregnated with heteropolyacids was investigated as catalyst for nitration of <b>anisol</b> using HNO 3 as nitrating agent. The use of HNO 3 {{together with a}} solid acid catalyst is an environmentally attractive alternative to the conventional procedure that employs HNO 3 together with H 2 SO 4. The aqueous nitric acid was loaded in the pores of the mesoporous material and the HNO 3 filled particles were subsequently dispersed in <b>anisol.</b> The reaction {{took place at the}} interface between the two liquid phases, i. e., at the pore openings. It was shown that ordered mesoporous silica is more efficient than amorphous silica and that silica with cubic geometry is the most efficient. Two heteropolyacids of Keggin type, phosphotungstic acid and phosphomolybdic acid, were tested. One Wells–Dawson type of phosphotungstic acid was included as well as cesium exchanged heteropolyacid acids of Keggin type. The best yield was obtained with mesoporous cubic silica impregnated with cesium exchanged phosphotungstic acid. The amount of heteropolyacid used in the impregnation turned out to be critical. Above a certain loading the activity went down, probably due to clogging of the pores. The preferred catalyst could also be reused with retained activity...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{publication}} of papers on the electro-phoresis of serum proteins in filter paper strips by Cremer and Tiselius (1950), Durrum (1950), Turba and Enenkel (1950), and Flynn and de Mayo (1951), several {{attempts have been made}} to simplify the technique by the elimination of the tedious elution and subsequent estimation of the protein fractions. Grassmann, Hannig, and Knedel (1951) rendered the strip translucent with <b>anisol</b> ana it was then read in the special apparatus described by Knedel (1951). This is unobtainable in Britain and the method of construction results in a graph of small dimensions which is difficult to analyse. A much simpler apparatus was devised, which, while accurate, had the disadvantage that it was not permanent, bu...|$|E
40|$|The {{uncoupling}} {{activities of}} 14 binary mixtures of substituted phenols and of 4 binary mixtures of phenols and <b>anisols</b> were investigated at different pH values. Experiments were performed with time-resolved spectroscopy on membrane vesicles (chromatophores) of the photosynthetic bacteria Rhodobacter sphaeroides. Phenols {{are known to}} destroy the electrochemical proton gradient in energy-transducing membranes by a protonophoric mechanism. <b>Anisols</b> do not have protonophoric activity but disturb membrane structure and functioning as a nonspecific baseline toxicant. It was postulated in the literature that, for certain substituted phenols, {{the formation of a}} dimer between the phenoxide and the neutral phenol may contribute significantly to the overall protonophoric activity. In 13 of 14 mixtures of substituted phenols but in none of the mixtures of phenols with <b>anisols,</b> such a dimer appears to be formed between two different mixture partners. An extended shuttle mechanism of uncoupling, which includes a term for the contribution of such a mixed dimer, provided a good description of all experimental data. Opposite speciation favors interaction and ortho substituents abate interaction, which adds evidence for the dimer formation via a hydrogen bond between the phenol-OH and the phenoxide. These findings are significant not only regarding the mechanism of protonophoric action but also for the risk assessment process of chemical mixtures in the environment. When assessing the effect of mixtures, concentration addition is regarded as a reference concept to estimate effects of similarly acting compounds. The substituted phenols in this work act according to the same action mechanism of uncoupling. Nevertheless, the overall effect of four of the investigated mixtures, which exhibit stronger dimer formation as compared to the single compounds or for which the resulting dimer is intrinsically more active, exceeded the effect calculated according to concentration addition considerably. In future work, this synergistic effect observed in-vitro has to be validated in-vivo to deduce its implications for the risk assessment process...|$|R
40|$|For {{structured}} catalysts of biofuels {{transformation into}} syngas inexpensive and stable to sintering active components based upon Mg-doped γ-alumina with supported LaNi 0. 9 Ru 0. 1 O 3 perovskite or MnCr 2 O 4 spinel promoted by Ru + Ni were developed. Characterization {{of the surface}} features, reactivity, catalytic activity and routes of ethanol transformation on these catalysts demonstrated that suppression of support acidity, strong interaction of Ru-Ni alloy nanoparticles with manganese chromite layers on support and a high redox ability provide a high yield of syngas and stability to coking. The most promising active component (2 wt% Ni + 2 wt% Ru) /MnCr 2 O 4 / 10 wt% MgO − γ-Al 2 O 3 supported on microchannel heat-conducting CrAlO cermet plates demonstrated a high performance and stability to coking in the autothermal reforming of such reactive fuels as glycerol, <b>anisol</b> and turpentine oil...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Biocompatible and {{biodegradable}} synthetic {{materials have}} attracted considerable attention {{during the past}} two decades. In this work, a series of amphiphilic triblock copolymers containing D-galactopyranose were synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The macroinitiator was prepared by the esterification between poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether with a number-average molecular weight of 1200 g/mol (MeOPEO- 1200) and 2 -bromoisobutyryl bromide. The sugar-bearing monomer, 6 -O-methacryloyl- 1, 2; 3, 4 -di-O-isopropylidene-D-galactopy-ranose (MAIPG) was polymerized using PMDETA/CuBr as catalytic system and <b>anisol</b> as solvent. The chemical structure and composition of the resultant polymer MeOPEO-b-PMAIPG were verified by 1 H NMR. The molecular weights and their polydispersities were characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The results indicate that the polymerization follows the mechanism of ATRP. The amphiphilic copolymers can self-assembly to from micelles with PMAIPG as the core and PEO as the corona, which have potential applications as biomaterials or controlled release drug delivery systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{present state}} of the art in the field of FRIEDEL-CRAFTS-ACYLATIONS is {{characterized}} by the application of homogenous catalysts (at least stochiometric amounts) like AlCl_ 3 or FeCl_ 3. Problems arising from this application are corrosions, difficult product separations from the catalyst and the origin of acid waste water. Hence, the aim of this project was the development of suitable solid catalysts which overcome the problems ascribed above. Sulfated zirconia (SZ) was found to be an excellent solid Br. o/nsted-acid to be used especially in their aerogel or cryogel form. Thus with this catalyst system, in the benzoylation of <b>anisol</b> nearly 100 % conversion may be achieved. In this way it could be proved, that with SZ a solid Br. o/nsted-acid might be available which gives reasonable hope to substitute in a near future, at least for some reactions, the classical homogeneous catalysts and to overcome their problems in use.

40|$|The {{content and}} {{composition}} of active ingredients and essential oils in medicinal and aromatic plants have been studied for several decades. The volatile compounds in essential oils have been analysed routinely using gas chromatography (GC) since 1966, and with GC coupled to mass spectrometric detection (GC/MS) since 1978. The 13 rose varieties selected for chemical analysis varied for colour, shape and fragrance. The static headspace solid phase microextraction (sHS-SPME) technique recently developed for sample preparation and sample enrichment was used to study the volatile aromatic components. The main volatile compound of a sweet-smelling purple rose {{was found to be}} phenyl ethyl alcohol (33 - 52 %). The phenyl ethyl alcohol content of fragrant rose flowers with blackish-purple petals increased continuously from early summer to late autumn (from 17 to 70 %). The dominant aromatic components of the yellow, orange and pink rose flowers were hexanol, hexenyl acetate and benzyl alcohol. Phenyl ethyl alcohol and orcinol dimethyl ether were the main constituents of the fragrant pink and white rose varieties. Methyl vinyl <b>anisol</b> and orcinol dimethyl ether were dominant in rose flowers with beige petals. In summary, it can be concluded that the SPME-GC/MS method is suitable for the characterization of rose varieties and for the chemical analysis of aromatic volatile compounds...|$|E
40|$|In many insect species {{olfaction}} {{is a key}} sensory modality. However, {{examination of}} the chemical ecology of insects has focussed up to now on insects living above ground. Evidence for behavioral responses to chemical cues in the soil other than CO 2 is scarce and {{the role played by}} olfaction in the process of finding host roots below ground is not yet understood. The question of whether soil-dwelling beetle larvae can smell their host plant roots has been under debate, but proof is as yet lacking that olfactory perception of volatile compounds released by damaged host plants, as is known for insects living above ground, occurs. Here we show that soil-dwelling larvae of Melolontha hippocastani are well equipped for olfactory perception and respond electrophysiologically and behaviorally to volatiles released by damaged host-plant roots. An olfactory apparatus consisting of pore plates at the antennae and about 70 glomeruli as primary olfactory processing units indicates a highly developed olfactory system. Damage induced host plant volatiles released by oak roots such as eucalyptol and <b>anisol</b> are detected by larval antennae down to 5 ppbv in soil air and elicit directed movement of the larvae in natural soil towards the odor source. Our results demonstrate that plant-root volatiles are likely to be perceived by the larval olfactory system and to guide soil-dwelling white grubs through the dark below ground to their host plants. Thus, to find below-ground host plants cockchafer larvae employ mechanisms that are similar to those employed by the adult beetle...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{continuous}} interest and need of developing environmentally benign synthetic routes. Increased public awareness and more rigid environmental legislation have elevated the drive towards sustainable development and ecocompatible syntheses. This thesis demonstrates {{the use of}} concentrated aqueous dispersions of mesoporous materials {{as a mean to}} perform effective ecocompatible organic syntheses between incompatible reactants. Mesoporous materials are highly attractive for this purpose since they can be precisely designed, functionalised, reused and have an overall low toxicity. An additional attractive feature of solid catalysts, such as mesoporous materials is the easy workup associated with their use. The use of mesoporous materials allows synthesis in aqueous reaction systems. Aqueous reaction systems have several benefits, such as low toxicity, low cost and high safety compared to flammable, carcinogenic or even explosive solvents. Three different types of organic reactions have been studied: (1) oxidation; the conversion of cyclohexene into adipic acid (2) carbon-carbon coupling; Friedel-Crafts alkylation of sodium salicylate with 4 -tert-butylbenzyl chloride and (3) nitration of <b>anisol</b> with aqueous nitric acid. For the oxidation reaction tungsten oxide, either used as the sole oxide material or as a mixed oxide with silica turned out to be very efficient and gave an almost quantitative yield of adipic acid. The proposed and designed reaction system minimize the emissions of the greenhouse gas NOx compared to the traditional industrial process. For the Friedel-Crafts carbon-carbon coupling reaction alumina, either used as the sole oxide material or as a mixed oxide had a high catalytic ability and gave an almost complete conversion of the substrate, sodium salicylate. The reaction system eliminates the use of stoichiometric amounts of acid. For the nitration reaction it was shown that silica or silica impregnated with heteropolyacid, in particular cesium exchanged phosphotungstic acid, enables nitration under mild and controlled conditions. The suggested reaction route eliminates the use of mineral acids, thus avoiding the problems associated with the liquid acid waste...|$|E
