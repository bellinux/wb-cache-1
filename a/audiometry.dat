5|$|The ear drum {{may become}} {{perforated}} {{in the event}} of a large sound or explosion, when diving or flying (called barotrauma), or by objects inserted into the ear. Another common cause of injury is due to an infection such as otitis media. These may cause a discharge from the ear called otorrhea, and are often investigated by otoscopy and <b>audiometry.</b> Treatment may include watchful waiting, antibiotics and possibly surgery, if the injury is prolonged or the position of the ossicles is affected. Skull fractures that go through the part of the skull containing the ear structures (the temporal bone) can also cause damage to the middle ear. A cholesteatoma is a cyst of squamous skin cells that may develop from birth or secondary to other causes such as chronic ear infections. It may impair hearing or cause dizziness or vertigo, and is usually investigated by otoscopy and may require a CT scan. The treatment for cholesteatoma is surgery.|$|E
25|$|Tests of {{auditory}} system (hearing) function include {{pure tone}} <b>audiometry,</b> speech <b>audiometry,</b> acoustic reflex, electrocochleography (ECoG), otoacoustic emissions (OAE), and the auditory brainstem response test.|$|E
25|$|Tests of {{auditory}} system (hearing) function include pure-tone <b>audiometry,</b> speech <b>audiometry,</b> acoustic-reflex, electrocochleography (ECoG), otoacoustic emissions (OAE), {{and auditory}} brainstem response test (ABR; {{also known as}} BER, BSER, or BAER).|$|E
25|$|Functionality {{of hearing}} aid {{applications}} may involve a hearing test (in situ <b>audiometry)</b> too. However, {{the results of}} the test are used only to adjust the device for comfortable working with the application. The procedure of hearing testing in any way cannot claim to replace an <b>audiometry</b> test carried out by a medical specialist, so cannot be a basis for diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} to treat is usually made after {{a combination of}} physical exam and laboratory diagnosis, with additional testing including <b>audiometry,</b> tympanogram, temporal bone CT and MRI. Decongestants, glucocorticoids, and topical antibiotics are generally not effective as treatment for non-infectious, or serous, causes of mastoid effusion. In less severe cases or those without significant hearing impairment, the effusion can resolve spontaneously or with more conservative measures such as autoinflation. In more severe cases, tympanostomy tubes can be inserted, possibly with adjuvant adenoidectomy.|$|E
25|$|A {{hearing aid}} or deaf aid is an electroacoustic device which is {{designed}} to amplify sound for the wearer, usually with the aim of making speech more intelligible, and to correct impaired hearing as measured by <b>audiometry.</b> This type of assistive technology helps people with hearing loss participate more fully in their communities by allowing them to hear more clearly. They amplify any and all sound waves through use of a microphone, amplifier, and speaker. There is a wide variety of hearing aids available, including digital, in-the-ear, in-the-canal, behind-the-ear, and on-the-body aids.|$|E
25|$|In early March of that year, neuroscientists Ursula Bellugi and Edward Klima {{came from}} the Salk Institute for Biological Studies to {{administer}} their own series of brain exams on Genie. <b>Audiometry</b> tests confirmed that she had regular hearing in both ears, but {{on a series of}} dichotic listening tests Bellugi and Klima found that she identified language sounds with 100% accuracy in her left ear while correctly answering at only a chance level in her right ear. Such an extreme level of asymmetry on these tests had previously only been documented in patients with either split-brain or who had undergone a hemispherectomy as an adult. When they gave her monaural tests for both language and non-language sounds she answered with 100% accuracy in both ears, which was normal. On non-language dichotic listening tests she showed a slight preference for identifying non-language sounds in her left ear, which was typical for a right-handed person and helped rule out the possibility of her brain only being reversed in dominance for language.|$|E
25|$|Immediately upon Genie's {{admission}} to Children's Hospital Howard Hansen, {{who was the}} head of the hospital's psychiatry division and an early expert on child abuse, and David Rigler, a therapist and USC pediatrics and psychology professor who was the chief psychologist at the hospital, took direct control of her care. The following day they assigned physician James Kent, another early advocate for child abuse awareness, to be her primary therapist. Early tests placed her estimated mental age at approximately a 13-month-old level, within the range of development when the earliest phases of language acquisition begin. <b>Audiometry</b> tests confirmed Genie had regular hearing in both ears, doctors found no physical or mental deficiencies explaining her lack of speech, and her few existing medical records did not contain any definitive diagnoses. Based on a series of daytime observations and sleep studies that Jay Shurley, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Oklahoma and a specialist in extreme social isolation, conducted in the months after her admission, doctors definitively ruled out autism or any brain damage.|$|E
25|$|Congenital amusia, {{commonly}} known as tone deafness, refers to a musical disability that cannot be explained by prior brain lesion, hearing loss, cognitive defects, or lack of environmental stimulation, and it affects about 4% of the population. Individuals who suffer from congenital amusia seem to lack the musical predispositions with which most people are born. They are unable to recognize or hum familiar tunes {{even if they have}} normal <b>audiometry</b> and above-average intellectual and memory skills. Also, they do not show sensitivity to dissonant chords in a melodic context, which, as discussed earlier, is one of the musical predispositions exhibited by infants. The hallmark of congenital amusia is a deficit in fine-grained pitch discrimination, and this deficit is most apparent when congenital amusics are asked to pick out a wrong note in a given melody. If the distance between two successive pitches is small, congenital amusics are not able to detect a pitch change. As a result of this defect in pitch perception, a lifelong musical impairment may emerge due to a failure to internalize musical scales. A lack of fine-grained pitch discrimination makes it extremely difficult for amusics to enjoy and appreciate music, which consists largely of small pitch changes.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} ways of {{evaluating}} how well a hearing aid compensates for hearing loss. [...] One approach is <b>audiometry</b> which measures a subject's hearing levels in laboratory conditions. [...] The threshold of audibility for various sounds and intensities is measured {{in a variety of}} conditions. [...] Although audiometric tests may attempt to mimic real-world conditions, the patient's own every day experiences may differ. [...] An alternative approach is self-report assessment, where the patient reports their experience with the hearing aid.|$|E
2500|$|Natural mode is characterised by {{subjective}} {{effect of}} balance of different frequency sounds, regardless of level of distortion, {{appearing in the}} reproduction device. It is also regardless of personal user's ability to perceive specific sound frequencies (excluding obvious hearing loss). The natural effect is obtained due to special sound processing algorithm (i.e. [...] "formula of subjective equalisation of frequency-response function"). Its principle is to assess frequency response function (FRF) of mediaplayer or any other sound reproduction device, in accordance with audibility threshold in silence (subjective for each person), and to apply gain modifying factor. The factor is determined {{with the help of}} integrated function to test audibility threshold: the program generates tone signals (with divergent oscillations – from minimum volume 30–45Hz to maximum volume appr. 16kHz), and user assess their subjective audibility. The principle is similar to in situ <b>audiometry,</b> used in medicine to prescribe a hearing aid. However, the results of test may be used to a limited extent as far as FRF of sound devices depends on reproduction volume. It means correction coefficient should be determined several times – for various signal strengths, which is not a particular problem from a practical standpoint.|$|E
5000|$|Acoustic {{immittance}} <b>audiometry</b> - Immittance <b>audiometry</b> is {{an objective}} technique which evaluates middle ear function by three procedures: static immittance, tympanometry, and {{the measurement of}} acoustic reflex threshold sensitivity. Immittance <b>audiometry</b> is superior to pure tone <b>audiometry</b> in detecting middle ear pathology.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} {{other kinds of}} <b>audiometry</b> {{designed}} to test hearing acuity rather than sensitivity (speech <b>audiometry),</b> or to testauditory neural pathway transmission (evoked response <b>audiometry).</b>|$|E
50|$|Conditioned play <b>audiometry</b> (CPA) {{is a type}} of <b>audiometry</b> done in {{children}} around 2 years of age.|$|E
50|$|Behavioral {{observation}} <b>audiometry</b> (BOA) {{is a type}} of <b>audiometry</b> done {{in children}} of age less than 6 months.|$|E
5000|$|Speech <b>audiometry</b> is a {{diagnostic}} hearing test designed to test word or speech recognition. It {{has become a}} fundamental tool in hearing-loss assessment. In conjunction with pure-tone <b>audiometry,</b> it can aid in determining the degree and type of hearing loss. Speech <b>audiometry</b> also provides information regarding discomfort or tolerance to speech stimuli and information on word recognition abilities. In addition, information gained by speech <b>audiometry</b> can help determine proper gain and maximum output of hearing aids and other amplifying devices for patients with significant hearing losses and help assess how well they hear in noise. Speech <b>audiometry</b> also facilitates audiological rehabilitation management.|$|E
50|$|Tests of {{auditory}} system (hearing) function include {{pure tone}} <b>audiometry,</b> speech <b>audiometry,</b> acoustic reflex, electrocochleography (ECoG), otoacoustic emissions (OAE), and the auditory brainstem response test.|$|E
5000|$|Békésy <b>audiometry,</b> {{also called}} decay <b>audiometry</b> - <b>audiometry</b> {{in which the}} subject {{controls}} increases and decreases in intensity as {{the frequency of the}} stimulus is gradually changed so that the subject traces {{back and forth across the}} threshold of hearing over the frequency range of the test. The test is quick and reliable, so was frequently used in military and industrial contexts.|$|E
50|$|Tests of {{auditory}} system (hearing) function include pure-tone <b>audiometry,</b> speech <b>audiometry,</b> acoustic-reflex, electrocochleography (ECoG), otoacoustic emissions (OAE), {{and auditory}} brainstem response test (ABR; {{also known as}} BER, BSER, or BAER).|$|E
50|$|Identification of {{sensorineural hearing}} loss is usually made by {{performing}} a pure tone <b>audiometry</b> (an audiogram) in which bone conduction thresholds are measured. Tympanometry and speech <b>audiometry</b> may be helpful. Testing is performed by an audiologist.|$|E
50|$|There {{are cases}} where {{conventional}} PTA {{is not an}} appropriate or effective method of threshold testing. Procedural changes to the conventional test method may be necessary with populations {{who are unable to}} cooperate with the test in order to obtain hearing thresholds. Sound field <b>audiometry</b> may be more suitable when patients are unable to wear earphones, as the stimuli are usually presented by loudspeaker. A disadvantage of this method is that although thresholds can be obtained, results are not ear specific. In addition, response to pure tone stimuli may be limited, because in a sound field pure tones create standing waves, which alter sound intensity within the sound field. Therefore, {{it may be necessary to}} use other stimuli, such as warble tones in sound field testing. There are variations of conventional <b>audiometry</b> testing that are designed specifically for young children and infants, such as behavioral observation <b>audiometry,</b> visual reinforcement <b>audiometry</b> and play <b>audiometry.</b>|$|E
50|$|Conventional <b>audiometry</b> tests {{frequencies}} between 250 hertz (Hz) and 8 kHz, whereas {{high frequency}} <b>audiometry</b> {{tests in the}} region of 8 kHz-16 kHz. Some environmental factors, such as ototoxic medication and noise exposure, appear to be more detrimental to high frequency sensitivity than to that of mid or low frequencies. Therefore, high frequency <b>audiometry</b> is an effective method of monitoring losses that are suspected to have been caused by these factors. It is also effective in detecting the auditory sensitivity changes that occur with aging.|$|E
