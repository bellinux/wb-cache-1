When the RPF soldiers abandoned the Ugandan army and invaded Rwanda in 1990, Museveni did not explicitly support them, but according to Prunier it is likely that he had prior knowledge of the plan. Museveni also allowed the RPF safe passage through Ugandan territory to the Virunga mountains after their early defeats in the war, and revealed in a 1998 heads of state meeting that Uganda had helped the RPF materially during the Rwandan Civil War. Following the RPF victory, the two countries enjoyed a close political and trade relationship.|$|E

25|$|The {{black church}} in the United States {{developed}} out of the creolization of African spirituality and European-American Christianity; early members of the churches made certain stories their own.

25|$|Many of the Cylons {{also share}} a religion. It differs greatly from the humans' religion; it is monotheistic and shares many beliefs of Abrahamic monotheistic {{religions}} (God is omniscient, omnipotent, omnibenevolent, {{that he will}} one day deliver divine retribution and that he intervenes in the world). Much like Evangelical Christianity, the Cylon religion encourages <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> <b>relationship</b> with God. Despite being man-made, Cylons believe that they were created by God. The different Cylon models have varying degrees of faith; at least one, Cavil, does not subscribe to any religion. Some humans have come to follow the Cylon religion, mostly by way of Gaius Baltar, who himself grew {{to believe in the}} Cylon religion through the efforts of Caprica Six.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his career, Gallatin pursued an {{interest}} in Native American language and culture.

Gallatin's research resulted in two published works: A Table of Indian Languages of the United States (1826) and Synopsis of the Indian Tribes of North America (1836). His research led him to conclude that the natives of North and South America were linguistically and culturally related and that their common ancestors had migrated from Asia in prehistoric times.|$|E
