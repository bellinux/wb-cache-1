40|$|Concerns that (1) {{growth in}} {{developing}} countries could worsen the US terms of trade and (2) that increased US trade with developing countries will increase US wage inequality both implicitly reflect the assumption that goods produced in the United States <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> countries are close substitutes and that specialization is incomplete. In this paper we show on the contrary that there are distinctive patterns of international specialization <b>and</b> that <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> countries export fundamentally different products, especially those classified as high tech. Judged by export shares, the United States <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> countries specialize in quite different product categories that, for the most part, do not overlap. Moreover, even when exports are classified in the same category, there are large and systematic differences in unit values that suggest the products made by <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> countries are not very close substitutes—developed country products are far more sophisticated. This generalization is already recognized in the literature {{but it does not}} hold for all types of products. Export unit values of <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> countries of primary commodity–intensive products are typically quite similar. Unit values of standardized (low-tech) manufactured products exported by <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> countries are somewhat similar. By contrast, the medium- and high-tech manufactured exports of <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> <b>developing</b> countries differ greatly. This finding has important implications.
