5000|$|Kotlikoff's {{proposed}} {{reform of}} the financial system, discussed in Jimmy Stewart Is Dead, called Limited <b>Purpose</b> <b>Banking,</b> transforms <b>all</b> financial companies with limited liability, including incorporated banks, insurance companies, financial exchanges, and hedge funds, into pass-through mutual funds, which do not borrow to invest in risky assets, but, instead, allows the public to directly choose what risks it wishes to bear by purchasing more or less risky mutual funds. [...] According to Kotlikoff, Limited <b>Purpose</b> <b>Banking</b> keeps banks, insurance companies, hedge funds and other financial corporations from borrowing short and lending long, which leaves the public {{to pick up the}} pieces when things go south. Instead, Kotlikoff argues Limited <b>Purpose</b> <b>Banking</b> forces financial intermediaries to limit their activities to their sole legitimate purpose—financial inter-mediation. It would substitute the vast array of extant federal and state financial regulatory bodies with a single financial regulator called the Federal Financial Authority (FFA), which would have a narrow purpose namely to verify, disclosure, and oversee the independent rating and custody off all securities purchased and sold by mutual funds.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} to BLAST for comparing two banks of sequences is PLAST.

50|$|However, the Basel Committee {{recognizes that}} {{operational}} risk {{is a term}} that {{has a variety of}} meanings and therefore, for internal <b>purposes,</b> <b>banks</b> are permitted to adopt their own definitions of operational risk, provided that the minimum elements in the Committee's definition are included.|$|R
30|$|It {{is known}} that PVAc based {{adhesives}} may contain CN within the formulation (for instance UHU <b>All</b> <b>Purpose)</b> [36, 41]. When CN is present within a PVAc based formulation, this may compromise its ageing as determined by Down et al. [42], where the commercial product UHU <b>All</b> <b>Purpose,</b> initially performs well but later dramatically deteriorates in performance with ageing. A PVAc + CN formulation may have been applied to the vessels when additional repairs were made using UHU <b>All</b> <b>Purpose</b> before photographing artefacts for the virtual museum project in 1996. Alternatively, this formulation may have been applied at the relevant excavation site or when conserved, as UHU <b>All</b> <b>Purpose</b> {{is one of the}} longest used and most widely accessible adhesives across the globe [43].|$|R
