25|$|On 28 April 1689 Jollie took up {{the case}} of Richard Dugdale, the alleged ‘demoniack’ of Surey, near Clitheroe. He {{maintained}} that Dugdale's was ‘as real a possession <b>as</b> <b>any</b> <b>in</b> the gospels.’ With the aid of over twelve nonconforming divines, including Richard Frankland and Oliver Heywood, he tried exorcism by prayer and fasting. The young man's recovery was slow; the religious meetings began on 8 May 1689, and were not effective till 24 March 1690. In a tract of 1697 Jollie ascribed his cure to the prayers of the nonconformists. Zachary Taylor (died 1703), vicar of Ormskirk, son of an ejected minister of the same name, wrote two tracts (1697–9) to expose the ‘popery’ and ‘knavery’ of this business. John Carrington (died 1701), presbyterian minister at Lancaster, who had taken part in the exorcism, came forward in its defence; Frankland and Heywood were significantly silent.|$|E

[...] It operated as licensed premises from 1897 until 1981.|$|E

Shankly {{developed}} into [...] "as tough a half back <b>as</b> <b>any</b> <b>in</b> the Football League". The outstanding Northern Ireland international Peter Doherty recalled how Shankly dogged his footsteps in one match and kept muttering: [...] "Great wee team, North End, great wee team", subduing Doherty completely as Preston defeated Manchester City 3–1.|$|E
500|$|Burt had {{an unusual}} will, [...] "as bizarre but as finely-wrought <b>as</b> <b>any</b> <b>in</b> U.S. court annals". It {{contained}} a [...] "spite clause" [...] conceived by Burt to avenge a family feud. It specified to wait 21 {{years after his}} children and grandchildren were dead before {{the bulk of the}} fortune could go to any descendants, in effect alienating his children and grandchildren from the estate, beyond some small annuities. The conditions of the will were met in 2010 after the 1989 death of his last grandchild. In May 2011, twelve of Burt's descendants finally received the estate, worth about $100 million.|$|E
500|$|Miles did not {{normally}} introduce his literary friends to each other, but {{before his death}} he had been forced by circumstance to introduce Manning to the poet Stevie Smith. The two developed an immediate rapport and enjoyed exploring London's backstreets, with regular outings to museums, cinema, and visits to the Palmers Green home that Smith shared with an eccentric aunt. According to a mutual friend, Manning found in Smith's home [...] "an atmosphere of security and comfort which must have made her room in Oakley Street seem even chillier and more threadbare." [...] The novelist and critic Walter Allen met Manning in 1937 and observed {{that she had a}} [...] "devastating" [...] wit [...] "and was as formidable a young woman <b>as</b> <b>any</b> <b>in</b> London".

500|$|The show {{received}} a mixed reception from media publications. Some media outlets were {{more critical of}} the show. Television critic Lori Rackl of the Chicago Sun-Times criticized Crystal's performance saying that the emcee [...] "left his A game at home Sunday. Crystal's mediocre monologue was consistent with a mediocre 84th installment of Hollywood’s biggest awards ceremony. Columnist Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter quipped that [...] "Somewhere, against all odds, James Franco is buying drinks for everybody." [...] He {{went on to say}} that the previous year's critically panned telecast was eclipsed by Crystal's dull antics and that the show itself was [...] "poorly paced <b>as</b> <b>any</b> <b>in</b> recent memory." [...] Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times lamented, [...] "The whole night looked like an AARP pep rally." [...] She also noted that, [...] "For a town that prides itself on tinsel and titillation, the night was pretty tame." ...|$|E

500|$|Many of Bush's best-known {{works were}} written in the {{immediate}} postwar years. [...] Anthony Payne described the Three Concert Studies for Piano Trio (Op. 31) of 1947 as exceeding Britten in its inventiveness, [...] "a high-water mark in Bush's mature art". [...] The Violin Concerto (Op. 32, 1948) has been cited as [...] "a work as beautiful and refined <b>as</b> <b>any</b> <b>in</b> the genre since Walton's". Foreman considers the concerto, which uses twelve-tone themes, to be the epitome of Bush's thematic theory of composition, although Bush's contemporary, Edmund Rubbra, thought it too intellectual for general audiences. The Dorian Passacaglia and Fugue for timpani, percussion and strings, (Op. 52, 1959), involves eight variations in the Dorian mode, followed by eight in other modes culminating in a final quadruple fugue in six parts. Musical Opinions critic praised the composer's [...] "wonderful control and splendid craftsmanship" [...] in this piece, and predicted that it could become {{the most popular of}} all Bush's orchestral works.|$|E
500|$|The anime adaptations {{have also}} been very well-received and are better known in the Western world than the manga, with Anime News Network saying, [...] "Few anime series have mainstreamed it the way Dragon Ball Z has. To a certain {{generation}} of television consumers its characters are as well known <b>as</b> <b>any</b> <b>in</b> the animated realm, and for many {{it was the first}} step into the wilderness of anime fandom." [...] In 2000, satellite TV channel Animax together with Brutus, a men's lifestyle magazine, and Tsutaya, Japan's largest video rental chain, conducted a poll among 200,000 fans on the top anime series, with Dragon Ball coming in fourth. TV Asahi conducted two polls in 2005 on the Top 100 Anime, Dragon Ball came in second in the nationwide survey conducted with multiple age-groups and in third in the online poll.

C. Escher or a state-of-the-biz video game; the backwards splicing of Nolan's own Memento looks rudimentary by comparison." [...] The New York Post gave the film a four-star rating and Lou Lumenick wrote, [...] "DiCaprio, who has never been better as the tortured hero, draws you in with a love story that will appeal even to non-sci-fi fans." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film a full four stars and said that Inception [...] "is all about process, about fighting our way through enveloping sheets of reality and dream, reality within dreams, dreams without reality. It's a breathtaking juggling act." [...] Richard Roeper, also of the Sun-Times, gave Inception a perfect score of [...] "A+" [...] and called it [...] "one of the best movies of the [...] century." ...|$|E

500|$|From 2006 to 2007, Sheen starred as the {{television}} broadcaster David Frost in Frost/Nixon {{at both the}} Donmar Warehouse and Gielgud Theatre in London and at the Jacobs Theatre on Broadway. The play, written by Peter Morgan, directed by Michael Grandage and co-starring Frank Langella, was a critical and commercial success but Sheen initially accepted the role as a favour to his friends and [...] "never {{thought it was going}} anywhere". The Guardian said the actor [...] "exactly captures Frost's verbal tics and mannerisms while suggesting a nervousness behind the self-assurance". [...] "He's got the voice, the mannerisms, the blaze," [...] said the Financial Times, [...] "but, more than that, Sheen—as viscerally exciting an actor <b>as</b> <b>any</b> <b>in</b> Britain today—shows us the hunger of Frost's ambition [...]. and fox-like instinct for the hunt and the kill." [...] Sheen was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor and a Drama League Award for Distinguished Performance. Sheen next appeared in the 2007 film Music Within as a political activist with cerebral palsy. He spoke of having a [...] "responsibility" [...] to accurately portray the condition. Variety said his performance was [...] "remarkable.. utterly convincing", USA Today found him [...] "outstanding" [...] while the Los Angeles Times felt he was [...] "reminiscent of Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left Foot, bringing a vibrancy and wit to the role". Also that year, Sheen starred in the short film Airlock, or How To Say Goodbye in Space with Derek Jacobi and was invited to join the actors' branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences.|$|E
500|$|Man Ray photographed {{some of the}} {{mathematical}} models in the Institut Henri Poincaré in Paris, including Objet mathematique (Mathematical object). He noted that this represented Enneper surfaces with constant negative curvature, derived from the pseudo-sphere. This mathematical foundation was important to him, as it allowed him to deny that the object was [...] "abstract", instead claiming that it was as real as the urinal that Duchamp made into a work of art. Man Ray admitted that the object's [...] formula [...] "meant nothing to me, but the forms themselves were as varied and authentic <b>as</b> <b>any</b> <b>in</b> nature." [...] He used his photographs of {{the mathematical}} models as figures in his series he did on Shakespeare's plays, such as his 1934 painting Antony and Cleopatra. The art reporter Jonathan Keats, writing in ForbesLife, argues that Man Ray photographed [...] "the elliptic paraboloids and conic points in the same sensual light as his pictures of Kiki de Montparnasse", and [...] "ingeniously repurposes the cool calculations of mathematics to reveal the topology of desire". Twentieth century sculptors such as Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth and Naum Gabo took inspiration from mathematical models. Moore wrote of his 1938 Stringed Mother and Child: [...] "Undoubtedly the source of my stringed figures was the Science Museum... I {{was fascinated by the}} mathematical models I saw there... It wasn't the scientific study of these models but the ability to look through the strings as with a bird cage and to see one form within another which excited me." ...|$|E
