The sorption of <b>arsenite</b> <b>and</b> <b>arsenate</b> on metal oxides {{in the presence of}} various anionic ligands is closely linked to the mobility, bioavailability, and risk. It was reported that the sorption mechanisms <b>and</b> characteristics of <b>arsenite</b> <b>and</b> <b>arsenate</b> on Al-oxides were different from that on Fe-oxides. Previous work reports the sorption of <b>arsenite</b> <b>and</b> <b>arsenate</b> on Fe-oxides in the presence of ligands.

We tested the effect of organic ligands: oxalate, malate, tartrate, citrate; and inorganic ligands: sulfate, phosphate, selenate, selenite. Results show that amorphous Al-oxide has more sorption affinity for arsenate than arsenite. The inhibition of As sorption by ligands at pH 6 is higher for arsenite than arsenate. For arsenite, the As sorption inhibition decreases in the order phosphate, citrate, malate, selenite, oxalate, tartrate, sulfate, <b>and</b> selenate.

As species found in soil solution from a greenhouse experiment where rice was irrigated with arsenate contaminated water were <b>arsenite,</b> <b>arsenate,</b> dimethylarsinic acid, <b>and</b> monomethylarsonic acid. The short-term uptake kinetics for these four As species were determined in 7 -d-old excised rice roots. High-affinity uptake (0 – 0. 0532 mm) for <b>arsenite</b> <b>and</b> <b>arsenate</b> with eight rice varieties, covering two growing seasons, rice var. Boro (dry season) and rice var.

40|$|Arsenic {{pollution}} and its toxicity to aquatic organisms have attracted worldwide attention. The bioavailability and toxicity of arsenic are highly {{related to its}} speciation. The present study investigated the differences in bioaccumulation and oxidative stress responses in an aquatic organism, Daphnia magna, induced by 2 inorganic arsenic species (As(III) and As(V)). The bioaccumulation of arsenic, Na+/K+-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) content, total superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, total antioxidative capability, and malondialdehyde content in D. magna were determined after exposure to 500 mu g/L of <b>arsenite</b> <b>and</b> <b>arsenate</b> for 48 h. The {{results showed that the}} oxidative stress and antioxidative process in D. magna exposed to <b>arsenite</b> <b>and</b> <b>arsenate</b> could be divided into 3 phases, which were antioxidative response, oxidation inhibition, and antioxidative recovery. In addition, differences in bioaccumulation, Na+/K+-ATPase activity, and total SOD activity were also found in D. magna exposed to As(III) and As(V). These differences might have been the result of the high affinity of As(III) with sulfhydryl groups in enzymes and the structural similarity of As(V) to phosphate. Therefore, arsenate could be taken up by organisms through phosphate transporters, could substitute for phosphate in biochemical reactions, and could lead to a change in the bioaccumulation of arsenic and activity of enzymes.

40|$|Iron oxides and arsenic are {{prevalent}} in the environment. With the increase interest {{in the use of}} iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) for contaminant remediation and the high toxicity of arsenic, it is crucial that we evaluate the interactions between IONPs and arsenic. The goal was to understand the environmental behavior of IONPs in regards to their particle size, aggregation and stability, and to determine how this behavior influences IONPs-arsenic interactions. ^ A variety of dispersion techniques were investigated to disperse bare commercial IONPs. Vortex was able to disperse commercial hematite nanoparticles into unstable dispersions with particles in the micrometer size range while probe ultrasonication dispersed the particles into stable dispersions of nanometer size ranges for a prolonged period of time. Using probe ultrasonication and vortex to prepare IONPs suspensions of different particle sizes, the adsorption of <b>arsenite</b> <b>and</b> <b>arsenate</b> to bare hematite nanoparticles and hematite aggregates were investigated. To understand the difference in the adsorptive behavior, adsorption kinetics and isotherm parameters were determined. Both <b>arsenite</b> <b>and</b> <b>arsenate</b> were capable of adsorbing to hematite nanoparticles and hematite aggregates but the rate and capacity of adsorption is dependent upon the hematite particle size, the stability of the dispersion and the type of sorbed arsenic species. Once arsenic was adsorbed onto the hematite surface, both iron and arsenic can undergo redox transformation both microbially and photochemically and these processes can be intertwined. Arsenic speciation studies in the presence of hematite particles were performed and the effect of light on the redox process was preliminary quantified. The redox behavior of <b>arsenite</b> <b>and</b> <b>arsenate</b> were different depending on the hematite particle size, the stability of the suspension and the presence of environmental factors such as microbes and light. The results from this study are important and have significant environmental implications as arsenic mobility and bioavailability can be affected by its adsorption to hematite particles and by its surface mediated redox transformation. Moreover, this study furthers our understanding on how the particle size influences the interactions between IONPs and arsenic thereby clarifying the role of IONPs in the biogeochemical cycling of arsenic. ...|$|R

The maximum adsorption capacity of <b>arsenite</b> <b>and</b> <b>arsenate</b> was determined for coffee grounds (0. 66 and 0. 70 mg/g, respectively) and rice husk (0. 55 and 0. 66 mg/g, respectively). While desorption was observed for both coffee grounds and rice husk, the total amount of desorption accounted for less than 15 percent of the total retained mass. The results of this thesis work reveal that coffee can be used as an effective biosorbent when compared to rice husk; however, coconut substrate is less effective than rice husk at removing As (III) and As (V) ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Arsenic is {{a highly}} toxic {{metalloid}} in group 15 of periodic table. The information on environmental behaviour of arsenic, however, is still scarce. Contamination of soils and water with arsenic and antimony due to their widespread industrial application and mining activities has raised serious environmental concerns. Nearly all Arsenic-contaminated soils results from human activities and it has different environmental and sociological impacts. Various strategies and methods have been proposed for environmental management and remediation of contaminated soils. Among all methods, the phytoremediation is receiving more attention due to its cost effective and environmental friendly characteristics. In the case of arsenic contaminated soils, there are effective factors such as soil fertility, nutrients content and microorganisms function, which can improve the uptake of As by plants. Up to now, several studies have been evaluated the effects of symbiotic fungal association in plants on increasing nutrients and toxic elements uptake. Many of authors reported that the mycorrhizal symbiosis increases the uptake of toxic elements in root and shoot of plants and consequently improve the efficacy of phytostabilization and phytoextraction processes. There are conflicting results {{about the effect of}} arbuscular- mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on As uptake by various plants. Chen et al. (4) found that Glomus mosseae symbiosis with plant reduces As concentration and enhance phosphorus content in shoot and root of plant. Whilst Cozzolino et al. (7) reported that the AMF increases as concentration in shoot and root of cabbage. Phosphorus has important role on mycorrhizal symbiosis and also As uptake by plants. Therefore, current study was conducted to evaluated effect of Glomus intraradices and Glomus mosseae symbiosis with sunflower and also soil phosphorus concentration on uptake of arsenic from <b>arsenite</b> <b>and</b> <b>arsenate</b> contaminated soils. Materials and Methods:The soil sample (Typic Haplorthids) was collected, air dried and passed through 2 mm sieve and then were heated in 80 centigrade degree temperature for two times. A pot experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with factorial arrangement and three replications in greenhouse condition. The experimental factors included two species spices of inorganic As (50 mg kg- 1 of <b>Arsenite</b> <b>and</b> <b>Arsenate),</b> two levels of phosphorus (0 and 60 mg Kg- 1) and three spices of arbuscular mycorrhizae (control, Glomus intraradices and Glomus mosseae). Soil samples spiked with Na 2 HAsO 4. 7 H 2 O, NaAsO 2 (<b>Arsenite</b> <b>and</b> <b>Arsenate)</b> <b>and</b> Ca (H 2 PO 4) 2 (phosphorus) and incubated in greenhouse condition for 4 week. Sunflower seeds were planted and seedlings harvested after 60 day of sowing and then dry weight of sunflower, concentration of As and phosphorus in shoot and root of plant and root colonization percentage determined using standard methods. Results and Discussion:The results revealed that Glomus intraradices (GI) and Glomus mosseae (GM) symbiosis significantly (...|$|R
30|$|Consequently, the {{following}} study is designed to: (1) {{develop a new}} adsorbent from sugarcane carbon by modification with thioglycolic acid, (2) conduct batch operations to examine arsenic [As(III) and As(V)] adsorption using the new adsorbent, and (3) conduct column studies to investigate the <b>arsenite</b> <b>and</b> <b>arsenate</b> characteristics of thioglycolated SCC (TSCC) for higher concentrations of arsenic under an optimum pH condition of batch examination. An artificial neural network (ANN) model was applied upon batch experimental values to confirm the validity of TSCC as low-cost adsorbent for arsenic removal. The Thomas model was employed to evaluate the column adsorption performance. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and FTIR spectroscopy were employed to study surface morphology and functional groups.|$|R
40|$|Arsenic {{reduction}} {{in drinking water}} can include treatment by adsorption, switching to alternative water sources, or blending with water that has a lower arsenic concentration. Commercial sorbents MTM, Greensand and BIRM (Clack Corporation) were modified with zirconium and titanium after activation. The modifications were performed with titanium tetrachloride and zirconium tetrachloride. The modified sorbents were dried at different temperatures. The sorption of <b>arsenate</b> <b>and</b> <b>arsenite</b> dissolved in drinking water (200 μg L- 1) onto the sorbents were tested using a batch procedure. After removal of the sorbent, the concentration of arsenic was determined by HG-AAS. Zirconium-modified BIRM showed the best performance {{for the removal of}} both <b>arsenite</b> <b>and</b> <b>arsenate.</b> Modification of the greensand did not affect arsenic sorption ability. Zirconium-modified BIRM diminished the concentration of total As to below 5 μg L- 1...|$|R
