5|$|Diamonds {{have been}} treasured as gemstones since their use as {{religious}} icons in ancient India. Their usage in engraving tools also dates to early human history. The popularity of diamonds has risen since the 19th century {{because of increased}} supply, improved cutting <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> techniques, growth in the world economy, and innovative and successful advertising campaigns.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{industrial use}} of diamond is in cutting, drilling, grinding, <b>and</b> <b>polishing.</b> Most of these applications {{do not require}} large diamonds; in fact, most diamonds of gem-quality except for their small size can be used industrially. Diamonds are embedded in drill tips or saw blades, or ground into a powder for use in grinding <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> applications. Specialized applications include use in laboratories as containment for high pressure experiments (see diamond anvil cell), high-performance bearings, and limited use in specialized windows. With the continuing advances {{in the production of}} synthetic diamonds, new applications are becoming feasible. Garnering much excitement is the possible use of diamond as a semiconductor suitable for microchips, and because of its exceptional heat conductance property, as a heat sink in electronics.|$|E
5|$|Charcoal {{is used as}} {{a drawing}} {{material}} in artwork, barbecue grilling, iron smelting, and in many other applications. Wood, coal and oil are used as fuel for production of energy and heating. Gem quality diamond is used in jewelry, and industrial diamonds are used in drilling, cutting <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> tools for machining metals and stone. Plastics are made from fossil hydrocarbons, and carbon fiber, made by pyrolysis of synthetic polyester fibers is used to reinforce plastics to form advanced, lightweight composite materials.|$|E

5|$|Thin {{sectioning}} was {{an early}} procedure used to analyse fossilised material contained in coal balls. The process required cutting a coal ball with a diamond saw, then flattening <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> the thin section with an abrasive. It would be glued to a slide and placed under a petrographic microscope for examination. Although the process could be done with a machine, {{the large amount of}} time needed and the poor quality of samples produced by thin sectioning gave way to a more convenient method.|$|E
5|$|A concave line of {{abrasion}} <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> can {{be found}} on both one of the central kerb-stones on the western end of the monument and a kerb-stone on the south-east of the monument. These have been attributed to the sharpening of flint and other stone axe-blades on these sarsens. It is possible that these tools were sharpened for use in cutting and carving the timber levers and struts which would have been used in erecting the stones and constructing the tomb. Similar evidence for the sharpening of tools has been found at West Kennet Long Barrow, as well as later prehistoric monuments such as Stonehenge.|$|E
5|$|By the Han dynasty, the Chinese {{developed}} various {{uses for}} the waterwheel. An improvement of the simple lever-and- tilt hammer device operated by one's foot, the hydraulic-powered trip hammer used for pounding, , <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> grain was first mentioned in the Han dictionary Jijiupian of 40 BCE. It was also mentioned in the Regional Speech (Fangyan) dictionary written by Yang Xiong (53 BCE– 18 CE) in 15 BCE, the philosophical Xinlun 新論 written by Huan Tan (43 BCE– 28 CE) in 20 CE, the poetry of Ma Rong (79–166 CE), and the writings of Kong Rong (153–208 CE).|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} of the episode, originally scheduled for January 1990, was moved to December 1989 to accommodate the filming availability of Crosby and Whoopi Goldberg, who played Guinan. The task of writing <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> the new treatment in half the time fell upon writer Ronald D. Moore, who submitted his first draft on November 9. Moore's script removed the alien probe and made the alternate universe militaristic, with the Federation and the Klingons at war. Some characters, such as Troi, appeared only briefly {{at the beginning of}} the episode to allow more screen time for the guest characters. The beat sheet for the episode, which detailed characters and scenes, was distributed on November 27.|$|E
5|$|The {{waterwheel}} {{appeared in}} Chinese records during the Han. As mentioned by Huan Tan in about 20 AD, {{they were used}} to turn gears that lifted iron trip hammers, and were used in pounding, threshing <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> grain. However, there is no sufficient evidence for the watermill in China until about the 5th century. The Nanyang Commandery Administrator and mechanical engineer Du Shi (d.38 AD) created a waterwheel-powered reciprocator that worked the bellows for the smelting of iron. Waterwheels were also used to power chain pumps that lifted water to raised irrigation ditches. The chain pump was first mentioned in China by the philosopher Wang Chong in his 1st-century-AD Balanced Discourse.|$|E
5|$|By 2000, Gas Powered Games {{had begun}} {{to search for a}} {{publisher}} for the game. Taylor claims that multiple publishers were interested in the game, but he was convinced by Ed Fries to partner with the newly established Microsoft Game Studios. Although Microsoft's publishing wing was established in part to publish games for the newly announced Xbox console, Gas Powered Games and Microsoft did not strongly consider bringing the game to the console. Taylor believes that this was due {{to the size of the}} game itself, as well as the small market for role-playing games on consoles at the time. Dungeon Siege was initially planned for release in the third quarter of 2001, before being delayed to the following year, and Gas Powered Games spent the added time tuning <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> the game and expanding the game's items and multiplayer features. Dungeon Siege was released for Microsoft Windows on April 5, 2002, and for MacOS on May 2, 2003 by Destineer.|$|E

5|$|Once {{purchased}} by Sightholders (which is a trademark term {{referring to the}} companies that have a three-year supply contract with DTC), diamonds are cut and polished in preparation for sale as gemstones ('industrial' stones are regarded as a by-product of the gemstone market; they are used for abrasives). The cutting <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> of rough diamonds is a specialized skill that is concentrated in {{a limited number of}} locations worldwide. Traditional diamond cutting centers are Antwerp, Amsterdam, Johannesburg, New York City, and Tel Aviv. Recently, diamond cutting centers have been established in China, India, Thailand, Namibia and Botswana. Cutting centers with lower cost of labor, notably Surat in Gujarat, India, handle a larger number of smaller carat diamonds, while smaller quantities of larger or more valuable diamonds {{are more likely to be}} handled in Europe or North America. The recent expansion of this industry in India, employing low cost labor, has allowed smaller diamonds to be prepared as gems in greater quantities than was previously economically feasible.|$|E
5|$|Setting out {{to write}} {{something}} on an epic scale, Martin projected to write three books of 800 manuscript pages {{in the very early}} stages of the series. His original 1990s contract specified one-year deadlines for his previous literary works, but Martin only realized later that his new books were longer and hence required more writing time. In 2000, Martin planned to take 18 months to two years for each volume and projected the last of the planned six books to be released five or six years later. However, with the Ice and Fire series evolving into the biggest and most ambitious story he has ever attempted writing, he still has two more books to write as of 2016. Martin said he needed to be in his own office in Santa Fe, New Mexico to immerse himself in the fictional world and write. As of 2011, Martin was still typing his fiction on a DOS computer with WordStar 4.0 software. He begins each day at 10am with rewriting <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> the previous day's work, and may write all day or struggle to write anything. Excised material and previous old versions are saved to be possibly re-inserted at a later time.|$|E
5|$|At the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), Criterion Games' {{director}} of design Alex Ward {{was approached by}} Bruce McMillan, executive vice president at EA Worldwide Studios. McMillan wanted to reconcile EA's relationship with Criterion and partner with them on a game. Initially, Ward refused, citing their past experience {{of working with the}} publisher. However, EA persisted and suggested Criterion make Burnout 3 with them. Originally, the studio was waiting until the next generation of video game hardware launched before starting work on a third instalment. Criterion accepted the deal on the conditions that EA would not interfere with the game's development and that Criterion had the freedom to create the game they wanted. Development on Burnout 3 began immediately after the expo in June 2003, with a larger team of staff working on the game than its predecessors. By January 2004, Criterion had a build of the game ready to demonstrate to EA. The development team had drafted a number of subtitles for Burnout 3 including Fuel Injection, Crash and Burn, Seek and Destroy, Takedown along with some more ridiculous suggestions like See You in Hell. Internally, they felt that Takedown was not an appealing choice, however the outcome of EA's focus testing proved otherwise. Despite a rocky start in their relationship with EA, Criterion admitted to benefiting from the publisher's experience throughout the course of Burnout 3s development. By July 2004, development on the game was nearly complete with the remaining work confined to bug testing <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> the experience. On 28 July 2004, EA announced that they had acquired Criterion along with the Burnout intellectual property. McMillan stated that their strong expectations for Burnout 3 and ownership of the series were key reasons for buying Criterion.|$|E
