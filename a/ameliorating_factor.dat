The diverse local interpretations of the icon mirror the shift from exclusion to inclusion of disabled people in the human rights revolution witnessed {{since the end of}} WWII. The traditional icon displays a figure and a real life object. In so doing, the access icon unwittingly creates a cyborg (see Haraway 1991) : the wheelchair and its human user become one.

40|$|Background The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to explore the impact of a particular management style called practice leadership upon the experience of staff working in services for people with intellectual disability and challenging behaviour. Such staff have been shown to experience high stress and lack of job satisfaction. Support by the immediate manager may be an important <b>ameliorating</b> <b>factor.</b> However, style of manager support requires further exploration. Method A single point-in-time survey of staff in adult residential services within the South East of England collected data on practice leadership, stress, and positive work experiences. Results Practice leadership was positively associated with lower stress, greater positive work experiences for staff, and more strongly associated with “developmental” than “supportive” leadership. Effect sizes were small to medium. Conclusions Staff experience of working in challenging environments may be improved by style of front-line leadership. However, further conceptualisation and research of staff experience and practice leadership is required...|$|E

40|$|Information {{concerning}} the frequency, severity, character, location, duration, diurnal pattern of headache and ancillary symptoms were obtained in 25 patients with autonomic failure and 44 control subjects. Precipitating and <b>ameliorating</b> <b>factors</b> were identified. Autonomic failure patients had more {{head and neck}} discomfort than controls. Their discomfort was {{much more likely to}} localize in the occiput, nape of the neck and shoulder, compared with controls. There was a greater tendency for the discomfort to occur in the morning and after meals. It was sometimes less than 5 min in duration and was often associated with dimming, blurring, or tunnelling of vision. It was provoked by upright posture and relieved by lying down. Patients with severe autonomic failure and orthostatic hypotension often present with a posture-dependent headache or neck pain. Because the relationship of these symptoms to posture is often not recognized, the fact that these findings may signal an underlying autonomic disorder is underappreciated, and the opportunity to consider this aetiology for the headache may be missed...|$|R

40|$|Adipose tissue {{inflammation}} {{is believed}} to play {{a pivotal role in}} the development obesity-related morbidities such as insulin resistance. However, it is not known how this (low-grade) inflammatory state develops. It has been proposed that the leakage of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), originating from the gut microbiota, through the gut epithelium could drive initiation of inflammation. To get a better understanding of which proteins and intracellular pathways are affected by LPS in adipocytes, we performed SILAC proteomic analysis and identified proteins that were altered in expression. Furthermore, we tested the anti-inflammatory compound resveratrol. A total of 927 proteins were quantified by the SILAC method and of these 57 - and 64 were significantly up- and downregulated by LPS, respectively. Bioinformatic analysis (GO analysis) revealed that the upregulated proteins were especially involved in the pathways of respiratory electron transport chain and inflammation. The downregulated proteins were especially involved in protein glycosylation. One of the latter proteins, GALNT 2, has previously been described to regulate the expression of liver lipases such as ANGPTL 3 and apoC-III affecting lipid metabolism. Furthermore, LPS treatment reduced the protein levels of the insulin sensitizing adipokine, adiponectin, and proteins participating in the final steps of triglyceride- and cholesterol synthesis. Generally, resveratrol opposed the effect induced by LPS and, as such, functioning as an <b>ameliorating</b> <b>factor</b> in disease state. Using an unbiased proteomic approach, we present novel insight of how the proteome is altered in adipocytes in response to LPS as seen in obesity. We suggest that LPS partly exerts its detrimental effects by altering glycosylation processes of the cell, which is starting to emerge as important posttranscriptional regulators of protein expression. Furthermore, resveratrol could be a prime candidate in ameliorating dysfunctioning adipose tissue induced by inflammatory stimulation...|$|E

We investigated if a quantitative trait locus on chromosome 6 q 23 {{was significantly associated with}} HbF and F cell levels in individuals of African descent. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a 24 -kb intergenic region, 33 -kb upstream of the HBS 1 L gene and 80 -kb upstream of the MYB gene, were typed in 177 healthy Afro-Caribbean subjects (AC) of approximately 7 % European admixture, 631 Afro-Germans (AG, a group of African and German descendants located in rural Jamaica with about 20 % European admixture), 87 West African and Afro-Caribbean individuals with sickle cell anaemia (HbSS), as well as 75 Northern Europeans, which served as a contrasting population. Association with a tag SNP for the locus was detected in all four groups (AC, P= 0. 005, AG, P= 0. 002, HbSS patients, P= 0 = 019, Europeans, P= 1. 5 x 10 ^- 7). The association signal varied across the interval in the African-descended groups, while it is more uniform in Europeans. The 6 q QTL for HbF traits is present in populations of African origin and is also acting in sickle cell anaemia patients.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. Coenzyme Q 10 (Q 10) {{acts as an}} {{important}} in vivo anti-oxidant and has been widely advocated to be a beneficial dietary adjuvant because elevated concentrations of Q 10 should effect a higher energy production and anti-oxidant capacity, leading to lower DNA damage and cell death. It remains controversial however, whether oral administration of Q 10 can significantly enhance its tissue levels and/or can modulate the level of oxidative stress (DNA damage) in vivo. We investigated whether oral administration of coenzyme Q 10 (Q 10) in mice could increase the levels of its reduced form, Q 10 H 2, in blood and in tissue (brain, liver and heart) and determined the relationship between Q 10 H 2 concentrations in the blood and various tissues. These concentrations were correlated with cell DNA damage found in blood and in brain, liver and heart tissue. We also investigated if oral administration of Q 10 could attenuate the neurotoxicity of 1 - methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 64 etrahydropyridine (MPTP) in old mice, using damage to cell DNA as the parameter. In this study a method for assessing chemically and environmentally induced cell DNA damage was developed, using the single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay and compared these results with coenzyme Q concentrations in various tissue samples obtained by using a validated HPLC analysis with electrochemical detection. Four groups of one-year-old C 57 BL/ 6 mice received a standard diet or a diet supplemented with Q 10 (200 mg/kg/day) for six weeks. After four weeks, one group that had received the standard diet and one group that had received the Q 10 supplemented diet were treated additionally with one dosage of MPTP (40 mg/kg). The {{results showed that the}} Q 10 H 2 as well as the Q 9 H 2 concentrations were elevated in the plasma, brain, heart and liver of those groups receiving Q 10 and Q 10 + MPTP. This observation, as well as the phenomenon that the Q 9 H 2 levels were higher than the Q 10 H 2 levels in the controls indicated that Q 9 is the predominant Q homologue in mice and that oral intake of Q 10 increased the levels of both Q 9 H 2 and Q 10 H 2 in tissue and blood. The heart, brain and liver cells exhibited significantly higher DNA damage in the groups treated with MPTP. The group receiving MPTP plus Q 10 displayed less DNA damage than the MPTP group indicating that Q 10 most likely act as an <b>ameliorating</b> <b>factor</b> for MPTP neurotoxicity. The blood samples before and after treatment in contrast, showed very little difference in DNA damage. This might be {{explained by the fact that}} blood cells regenerate much faster than other tissue. Our findings indicate that levels of Q 10 and Q 9 can be increased in tissue by long-term supplementation with Q 10 and that Q 10 could attenuate/prevent DNA damage in various cells. This suggests that Q 10 may be useful in disorders where there is impaired activity of complex I, which might lead to DNA damage of the cell, such as Parkinson's disease. Master...|$|E
40|$|Degeneration of the lumbar {{intervertebral}} disc, {{a condition}} widely {{implicated in the}} cause of low back pain among adult humans, is typically characterised by progressive biochemical and structural changes to the extracellular matrix. Comprehensive descriptions of the structural and functional inter-relationships within the extracellular matrix are therefore critical to understanding the degenerative process and developing effective treatments. In the anulus fibrosus, this matrix has a complex, hierarchical architecture comprised of collagens, proteoglycans, and elastic fibres. Elastic fibres are critical constituents of dynamic biological structures that functionally require elasticity and resilience. Studies to date of elastic fibre network structure in the anulus fibrosus have been qualitative and limited in scope. Additionally, there is poor understanding of the structural and functional associations between elastic fibres and other matrix constituents such as collagen, and, critically, there have been no studies directly examining the nature and magnitude of the contribution made by elastic fibres to anulus fibrosus mechanical behaviour. In this thesis, multiple experimental studies are described that specifically examine each of these areas. Novel imaging techniques were developed and combined with histochemistry and light microscopy to facilitate the visualisation of elastic fibres at a level of detail not previously achieved. Examination of elastic fibre network structure revealed architectural differences between the intralamellar and interlamellar regions, suggesting that elastic fibres perform functional roles at distinct levels of the anulus fibrosus structural hierarchy. The density of elastic fibres within lamellae was found to be significantly higher in the lamellae of the posterolateral region of the anulus than the anterolateral, and significantly higher in the outer regions than the inner, suggesting it may be commensurate with the magnitude of the tensile strains experienced by each region of the disc in bending and torsion. The nature of the structure-function associations between elastic fibres and collagen was then examined with respect to the reported structural mechanisms of collagen matrix tensile deformation. Histological assessment of collagen crimp morphology in specimens from which elastic fibres had been enzymatically removed revealed no observable differences when compared with controls, suggesting that any contribution made by elastic fibres to maintaining crimp is minimal. Elastic fibres in anulus fibrosus specimens subjected to radial tensile deformations exhibited complex patterns of re-arrangement, suggesting that they maintain cross-collagen fibre connectivity. Elastic fibres were also observed to maintain physical connections between consecutive lamellae undergoing relative separation. Finally, the nature and magnitude of the contribution made by elastic fibres to anulus fibrosus mechanical properties at the tissue level was investigated using a combination of biochemically verified enzymatic treatments and biomechanical tests. Targeted degradation of elastic fibres resulted in a significant reduction in both the initial modulus and the ultimate modulus, and {{a significant increase in the}} extensibility, of radially oriented anulus fibrosus specimens. Separate treatments and mechanical tests were used to account for any changes attributable to non-specific degradation of glycosaminoglycans. These results suggest that elastic fibres enhance the mechanical integrity of the anulus fibrosus extracellular matrix in the direction perpendicular to the plane containing the collagen fibres. In summary, the results of the studies presented in this thesis provide important new insights into the structure and function of the anulus fibrosus elastic fibre network, and highlight its potential importance as a contributing or <b>ameliorating</b> <b>factor</b> in the progression of the structural and mechanical changes associated with intervertebral disc degeneration. Additionally, these results establish an improved framework for the development of more accurate analytical and finite element models to describe disc behaviour. Thesis (Ph. D.)

This paper reports on the science teaching self-efficacy {{in a group of}} teachers at a state primary school. The research was conducted in two stages using firstly the Science Teaching Efficacy Beliefs Instrument (STEBI-A) to identify cases, and secondly, a semistructured interview coupled with classroom observations. Thirty seven teaching staff were surveyed with the STEBI-A instrument. The five highest and five lowest scoring teachers on the personal science teaching self-efficacy subscale of the STEBI-A were interviewed.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{anthropogenic}} climate change on terrestrial organisms is often predicted to increase with latitude, in parallel with the rate of warming. Yet the biological impact of rising temperatures also depends on the physiological sensitivity of organisms to temperature change. We integrate empirical fitness curves describing the thermal tolerance of terrestrial insects {{from around the world}} with the projected geographic distribution of climate change for the next century to estimate the direct impact of warming on insect fitness across latitude. The results show that warming in the tropics, although relatively small in magnitude, is likely to have the most deleterious consequences because tropical insects are relatively sensitive to temperature change and are currently living very close to their optimal temperature. In contrast, species at higher latitudes have broader thermal tolerance and are living in climates that are currently cooler than their physiological optima, so that warming may even enhance their fitness. Available thermal tolerance data for several vertebrate taxa exhibit similar patterns, suggesting that these results are general for terrestrial ectotherms. Our analyses imply that, in the absence of <b>ameliorating</b> <b>factors</b> such as migration and adaptation, the greatest extinction risks from global warming may be in the tropics, where biological diversity is also greatest...|$|R
40|$|An {{earlier age}} at onset of {{schizophrenia}} in men {{as opposed to}} women, has been widely reported, but hitherto, insufficient account has been taken of parameters that might confound this finding. Furthermore, few explanatory models have accounted for the differences in shape of the age-at-onset distributions in males and females with schizophrenia. A catchment area sample of 477 first contact cases with schizophrenia or related disorders was ascertained through a case register. Differences in age at onset distributions {{between males and females}} were determined, and adjustment made for potential confounding factors. The most powerful predictors of early illness-onset were poor premorbid occupational functioning, single marital status, and male sex. The earlier onset in males was robust to controlling for other parameters. The shape of the onset distribution also differed between the sexes: SKUMIX analysis revealed a two-peak distribution for males, and a three-peak distribution for females. The mean age at onset for schizophrenia is earlier in males, and the onset distribution differs between the sexes. Psychosocial variables cannot explain these findings. Possible explanations for these gender differences include males and females being differentially susceptible to subtypes of illness With different mean ages at onset; precipitating and/or <b>ameliorating</b> <b>factors</b> operating at different stages of life in males and females; and/or an X-linked susceptibility locus that determines the age at onset. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Improvements in the survival rate of critically ill patients in the ED are directly related to the advancement of early recognition and treatment. Frequent episodes of overcrowding and prolonged waiting times force EDs to operate beyond their capacity and threaten to impact upon patient care. The objectives of this review are as follows: (a) to establish overcrowding as a threat to patient outcomes, person-centered care, and public safety in the ED; (b) to describe scenarios in which point-of-care testing (POCT) has been found to <b>ameliorate</b> <b>factors</b> thought to contribute to overcrowding; and (c) to discuss how POCT can be used directly, and indirectly, to expedite patient care and improve outcomes. Various studies have shown that overcrowding in the ED has profound effects on operational efficiency and patient care.

In certain scenarios, POCT has been found {{to increase the number of}} patients discharged in a timely manner, expedite triage of urgent but non-emergency patients, and decrease delays to treatment initiation.

The objective of this research is to investigate thermal and visual comfort and perception in tree shaded area in open urban spaces and to compare the performance of areas shaded by different types of tree coverage, including an open area without vegetation, located in a hot and dry climate.

40|$|Background  Minimally {{disruptive}} medicine (MDM) {{is proposed}} {{as a method}} for more appropriately managing people with multiple chronic disease. Much clinical management is currently single disease focussed, with people with multimorbidity being managed according to multiple single disease guidelines. Current initiatives to improve care include education about individual conditions and creating an environment where multiple guidelines might be simultaneously supported. The patientcentred medical home (PCMH) {{is an example of}} the latter. However, educational programmes and PCMH may increase the burden on patients. Problem  The cumulative workload for patients in managing the impact of multiple disease-specific guidelines is only relatively recently recognised. There is an intellectual vacuum as to how best to manage multimorbidity and how informatics might support implementing MDM. There is currently no alternative to multiple singlecondition- specific guidelines and a lack of certainty, should the treatment burden need to be reduced, as to which guideline might be ‘dropped’. Action  The best information about multimorbidity is recorded in primary care computerised medical record (CMR) systems and in an increasing number of integrated care organisations. CMR systems have the potential to flag individuals who might be in greatest need. However, CMR systems may also provide insights into whether there are <b>ameliorating</b> <b>factors</b> that might make it easier for them to be resilient to the burden of care. Data from such CMR systems might be used to develop the evidence base about how to better manage multimorbidity.

However, substantial investment in research-driven CMR development is needed if we are to achieve this. </p...|$|R

Objectives: To evaluate the perceptions and beliefs of Saudi youth on acne. Materials And Methods: Three hundred twenty-nine male students (aged 13 - 22 years) from 6 secondary schools in the Eastern Saudi Arabia completed a self-reported questionnaire on knowledge, causation, exacerbating and relieving factors of acne. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 15. 0. Results of subjects with acne, {{a family history of}} acne, and parents′ educational levels were compared. Differences between the analyzed groups were assessed by a Chi-square test; p ≤ 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Over half (58. 9 %) of the participants considered acne a transient condition not requiring therapy. Only 13. 1 % knew that the proper treatment of acne could take a long time, even several years. Over half (52 %) thought acne can be treated from the first or after few visits to the doctor. Popular sources of information were television/radio (47. 7 %), friends (45. 6 %), and the internet (38 %). Only 23. 4 % indicated school as a source of knowledge.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{growing body}} of {{research}} evidence from countries around the world indicates that economic recession is associated with increases in suicide, particularly in males of working age. AIMS: To explore contributory and <b>ameliorating</b> <b>factors</b> associated with economic recession and suicide and thereby stimulate further research in this area and encourage policy makers to consider how best to reduce the impact of recession on mental health and suicidal behaviour. METHOD: We conducted a selective review of the worldwide literature focusing on possible risk factors, mechanisms and preventative strategies for suicidal behaviour linked to economic recession. RESULTS: A model of how recession might affect suicide rates is presented. A major and often prolonged effect of recession is on unemployment and job insecurity. Other important effects include those exerted by financial loss, bankruptcy and home repossession. It is proposed these factors may lead directly or indirectly to mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and binge drinking and then to suicidal behaviour. Countries with active labour market programmes and sustained welfare spending during recessions have less marked increases in suicide rates than those that cut spending on welfare and job-search initiatives for the unemployed. Other measures likely to help include targeted interventions for unemployed people, membership of social organisations and responsible media reporting. Good primary care and mental health services are needed to cope with increased demand in times of economic recession but some governments have in fact reduced healthcare spending as an austerity measure. CONCLUSION: The research evidence linking recession, unemployment and suicide is substantial, but the evidence for the other mechanisms we have investigated is much more tentative. We describe the limitations of the existing body of research as well as make suggestions for future research into the effects of economic recession on suicidal behaviour...|$|R

The government and central bank authorities acknowledge the situation and have taken some steps toward reform. The most {{serious threat to the}} banking system lies in the accumulation of non-performing loans (NPLs) [...] many of them policybased loans extended by state-owned banks to money-losing state-owned companies with little expectation that they would be completely repaid. China has been taking measures to keep the problem from worsening and has created four asset management companies to dispose of NPLs that still have value. Since the Chinese economic reforms began in 1978, Chinese authorities have made significant progress in modernising their banking system, although they {{still have a long way}} to go. However, there are several <b>ameliorating</b> <b>factors</b> that still keep its financial and foreign exchange system viable. China's continued high rate of growth and high savings rate have funneled deposits into the banking system, while a $ 20 - 30 billion annual trade surplus together with an inflow of foreign direct investment at about $ 40 billion per year have resulted in an accumulation of foreign exchange reserves exceeding $ 200 billion. China does not carry an unusually heavy debt burden, either domestic or international, although its short-term borrowing in foreign currencies has been increasing. China does not currently face a serious risk of either a domestic or international liquidity crisis [...] unless, of course, a severe and prolonged world recession occurs that adversely affects Chinese exports as well as the inflow of foreign direct investment. ...|$|R
50|$|In a {{criminal}} matter, a priest may encourage the penitent {{to surrender to}} authorities. In certain very rare cases (according to a priest of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Peoria), if the priest truly feels the person is not contrite (sorry for the sin, either {{out of respect for}} God, or more properly, out of sorrow for sin), there are no <b>ameliorating</b> <b>factors</b> (such as age or maturity or addiction) and the priest has evidence of this by the penitent's words, manners, or behaviors, and especially if the sin is very severe and fully deliberate (mortal sin - especially a mortal sin that is punishable by a censure), is very scandalous - such as if the person is a senior public official or a cleric, and the sinning is chronic with no indication whatsoever of positive change or at least the intent to change, the priest may refuse to hear, or to continue to hear, the person's confession. With that being said, however, the Holy See and the Bishops of the world have stressed that that is not to be a norm for these situations, is generally to be discouraged if possible, and should be reserved strictly for rare, very serious, and scandalous cases. Even then, confessional secrecy still holds - whatever is said once the encounter begins (by the person going to the confessional area, taking a seat, and closing any door, and the priest saying a greeting and making the sign of the Cross, or the priest praying with and granting absolution to the person before they leave) is still protected from being ever revealed. However, those situations are the extent of the leverage the priest wields. He may not directly or indirectly disclose the matter to civil authorities himself.|$|R
40|$|We {{recognize}} that the collective intelligence of communities is largely untapped by traditional public participation (P 2) methods, which may result in less-than-ideal transit plans that neglect the needs of diverse constituencies. Mediated approaches may <b>ameliorate</b> contextual <b>factors</b> which inhibit participation in traditional methods, and, specifically, Web-based participatory activities would cast a wider net in the community, harnessing more and more diverse input. This paper discusses a P 2 model utilizing “crowdsourcing, ” which is a Web-based, distributed problem solving model already in use {{by a number of}} online businesses, a model which promises to be such an alternative P 2 method for public transit planning. This paper draws from a Federal Transit Administration (FTA) pilot project focused on the application of crowdsourcing to bus stop design at the neighborhood scale. We introduce the concept of crowdsourcing and then discuss the components of transit stop design. This is followed by preliminary results from Next Stop Design, our first case study in transit stop design...|$|R
40|$|Background Thalassemia is a {{monogenic}} disease, yet the clini- cal manifestations (phenotype) are variable {{although they}} have the same genotype. The clear-cut correlation between genotype and phenotype in β-thalassaemia/HbE patients remains unex- plained. There are several factors that {{play a role in the}} severity of the clinical manifestations, i. e. two alpha-gene deletion, homozy- gote Xmn 1 polymorphism +/+, -+-++, ++-++ haplotype, and hemo- globin Constant Spring. Objective To understand the clinical diversity of patients with HbE/ α thalassemia and to determine whether it is possible to predict phenotypic severity from genetic factors. Methods A descriptive study on clinical presentations and hema- tological data of beta-HbE thalassemia patients. DNA analysis was performed to detect β-thalassemia mutations and the <b>ameliorating</b> <b>factors</b> (alpha-globin genes deletions and Xmn 1 restriction site poly- morphism at position – 158 upstream of the G γ-globin gene) which were already known. Results Thirty patients with HbE/β thalassemia (4 to 29 years old) were recruited. IVS 1 -nt 5 (G>C) severe β + mutation was detected in 20 patients. Eighteen of 20 patients with positive IVS 1 -nt 5 mu- tation group were heterozygous for Xmn 1 restriction site polymor- phism and none of the patients was co-inherited with two á-globin gene deletion. Almost all patients (19 / 20) with positive IVS 1 -nt 5 mutation group required regular transfusions, yet the mean age at first blood transfusion was older in negative IVS 1 -nt 5 mutation group than that of positive IVS 1 -nt 5 mutation group (5. 7 vs 4 years). Mean hemoglobin before initial transfusion was higher in negative IVS 1 - nt 5 mutation group than that of positive IVS 1 -nt 5 mutation group (5. 88 vs 5. 39 g/dl). The mean total transfusion per year was lower in the negative IVS 1 -nt 5 mutation group than that of positive IVS 1 - nt 5 mutation group (190. 6 vs 215. 1 ml/year). Conclusions Beta-HbE thalassemia patients with identical beta thalassemia mutation (IVS 1 -nt 5) show remarkable clinical diver- sity. Neither two alpha-gene deletion, nor the Xmn 1 - G γ polymor- phism can explain the phenotypic variation. Other ameliorating determinants or genetic modifications responsible for the variable clinical severity remain to be explored...|$|R

40|$|Defying all {{rational}} expectations, {{the longest}} {{expansion in the}} U. S. economy in the 1990 s has failed to reduce the gender earnings gap. Empirical results based on Current Population Survey (CPS) show that the gender earnings gap widened from 1994 to 2001. The pattern of gender earnings gap described {{by the results of}} a decomposition analysis, overall and across three broadly defined occupation categories, is extremely consistent, indicating that women were adversely affected in comparison with men during the economic expansion in the 1990 s. Although slight, this undeniable failure was not only present in women 2 ̆ 7 s relatively weaker economic position as a whole, but it also crossed all occupational boundaries, extending its reach to the workers with blue-collar occupations. The result of a slightly widened gender earnings gap casts doubt on expectation of narrowing of the gap developed over the past several decades. In light of this new finding, future labor policy should focus on changing labor market structure to <b>ameliorate</b> the <b>factors</b> that fail to treat females and males equally to narrow the gender earnings gap...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of smoking on risk factors {{associated}} with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and determine the efficacy of antioxidant-rich berries in <b>ameliorating</b> these risk <b>factors</b> in postmenopausal smokers. Menopause and cigarette smoking have been identified as major risk factors for CVD due to a decrease in antioxidant protection, increase in inflammation and oxidative stress, and adverse changes in serum lipids. Antioxidants, specifically flavonoid compounds found in blackberries and blueberries, have been shown to prevent low-density lipoprotein cholesterol oxidation and thus prevent downstream inflammation and oxidative stress. Healthy, postmenopausal nonsmokers (n= 14) and smokers (n= 31) were recruited to participate in the three-month study and smokers were randomly assigned to one of three groups: smoker control (n= 12), smoker + 45 g/day freeze-dried blackberries (n= 6), or smoker + 45 g/day freeze-dried blueberries (n= 13). Body mass index, blood pressure, hemoglobin A 1 c, serum lipid profiles, glucose, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were assessed at baseline and the end of the study. A food frequency questionnaire was administered to assess dietary intake. A two-sample t-test was performed on nonsmokers (n= 14) and smokers (n= 31) at baseline to assess the effects of smoking on CVD risk factors in postmenopausal women and are reported as means ± SD. Following treatment, data were analyzed as percent change by group using a randomized, one factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed up with a protected least significant differences (LSD) test. This study showed that smokers had significantly higher serum triglycerides and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol than nonsmokers; 130 ± 11 mg/dL vs. 87 ± 7 mg/dL (p= 0. 0010) and 58 ± 3 mg/dL vs. 66 ± 3 mg/dL (p= 0. 0384), respectively. There were no significant effects of blackberry or blueberry treatment for three months in <b>ameliorating</b> risk <b>factors</b> associated with CVD in postmenopausal smokers. The effects of berries on CVD risk factors needs to be elucidated in a larger sample size...|$|R
40|$|During an {{outbreak}} of pertussis in the Cardiff area in 1974, 229 children with the disease were studied to assess the effect of immunisation upon its natural history and severity. The typical clinical features of pertussis, such as paroxysmal cough, whooping, vomiting, cyanosis, and irregular breathing, were less prevalent in both the immunised and the older children. Immunisation is the main factor in protecting against complications such as fits; and, together with older age, it protects against hospitalisation. Nevertheless, pertussis today {{can be just as}} severe as it was 40 years ago, and the vaccine remains the major <b>factor</b> <b>ameliorating</b> its natural history. The immunisation programme needs more active support by all child health workers...|$|R
40|$|Scholarship on the {{structural}} prevention of genocide and mass atrocities is, {{for the most}} part, saturated with identifying the ‘root causes’ of deadly violence. Conversely, the causes of peace and the processes that de-escalate tensions – in effect, “what goes right” – remain comparatively under researched. In his book The Structural Prevention of Mass Atrocities, Stephen McLoughlin contends that positioning prevention simply on identifying and <b>ameliorating</b> risk <b>factors</b> erroneously assumes a linear inevitability between cause and outcome, and thus “fails to explain why some at-risk countries experience mass atrocities, yet others do not” (3). McLoughlin convincingly advocates an analytical framework, which broadens structural prevention to include local and national conditions that mitigate risk by fostering resilience and stability. He then applies this framework to the cases of Botswana, Zambia, Tanzania and (an internal, relatively autonomous area within Tanzania), Zanzibar. By introducing a model that navigates the complex relationship between risk and resilience, McLoughlin complements the chorus of scholars asking “why?” mass atrocities occur, by asking “why not?” This book gently reminds readers that there are invaluable lessons to be learnt from peaceful non-events as much as from international tragedies...|$|R
40|$|Background. Studies have {{consistently}} {{found evidence of}} an association between unemployment and all-cause mortality. The association appears to follow a gradient, with more or longer unemployment spells associated with higher mortality rates than fewer or shorter (or no) unemployment spells. The association persists after simultaneously adjusting for potential confounders measured at baseline. Studies {{have found that the}} local unemployment rate modifies the relationship, with two of four studies finding that the mortality rate for the unemployed group was higher in areas or periods with low unemployment rates. Methods. I examined the relationship between unemployment and mortality in 2868 male household heads followed for up to 25 years and 2676 male household heads followed for up to 16 years as part of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. I used annual measures of unemployment as time-varying variables in Cox regression analyses and controlled for annual measures of potential confounders. I looked for an overall association, for a gradient in the association, and for variation in the association according to the local unemployment rate and the time period. Results. Men who were unemployed one or more times on the days of the annual survey had a higher hazard of death while in the labour force than men who were working on the days of the survey (hazard ratio 3. 23 [1. 61 - 6. 48]) and had a higher hazard of death while in the labour force or retirement than men who were working or retired (hazard ratio 3. 47 [1. 41 - 8. 56]). Men who experienced longer unemployment spells died earlier while in the labour force or retirement than those who experienced shorter (or no) unemployment spells (hazard ratio 1. 03 [1. 00 - 1. 05] for a one week change in the duration of unemployment). No clear relationship emerged between the number of unemployment spells and mortality. Men who were unemployed {{on the day of the}} survey and lived in an area with a low local unemployment rate tended to die earlier while in the labour force than men who were working on the day of the survey or who lived in an area with a high unemployment rate or both (hazard ratio 3. 50 [0. 78 - 15. 67]). Discussion. Unemployment spells and their duration increase the hazard of dying. These associations persisted after adjusting for annual measures of potential confounders. The study provides suggestive support for targeting assistance at unemployed men in areas with low unemployment rates. Future research should explore the behavioural and biological mechanisms through which unemployment could affect mortality and examine possible <b>ameliorating</b> <b>factors.</b> unemployment, mortality, longitudinal studies, proportional hazards models, socioeconomic status...|$|R
