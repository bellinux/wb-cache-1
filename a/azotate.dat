40|$|Results of {{experimental}} tests {{carried on a}} multistage step sludge recirculation activated sludge plant are presented. The main objective of this experimentation regards the characterization of the plant configuration that presents the maximum removal rate for carbonaceous and <b>azotate</b> substrate. The removal efficiency and the kinetics constants, {{as a function of}} the sludge recirculation flow in each stage, were also determined...|$|E
40|$|The dinuclear gold(I) dicationic complex [m-dpppAu 2 (pzH) 2] 2 +. 2 ClO 4 - {{prepared}} reacting [m-dpppAu 2] 2 +. 2 ClO 4 - (dppp = 1, 3 -bis(diphenylphosphi propane) {{with the}} <b>azotate</b> neutral heterocycle 3, 5 -dimethylpyrazole (pzH), as ancillary ligand, in THF. The X-ray crystal structure is reported: monoclinic, space group C 2 /c, a= 22. 598 (3), b= 11. 626 (1), c= 18. 539 (2), =̱ 116. 37 (1) V= 4364 (1) 3, z= 4. The structure consists in centrosymmetric dinuclear units, where the gold atoms show approximately linear coordination with P-Au-N of 177. 97 (2) Ṫhe gold(I) centres assume an anti conformation with a torsion angle Au-P-P-Au of 89. 2 (2) Ṅo intra or inter-molecular gold-gold interactions occurr.

40|$|The {{management}} and fertilization systems {{are particularly important}} owing to their influence both on tree behavior and soil properties as well. To highlight this influence of soil management systems (between tree rows and along the row) as well as N fertilization on some chemical components in soil, some investigations have been initiated since 1990 in a plum orchard established in 1984. The studies were performed on tipic planosol located on a flat land from the 3 rd terrace of Doamnei river. The following experimental scheme was organized: A Factor – Soil sampling depth, with the graduations: a 1 = 0 - 10 cm; a 2 = 10 - 20 cm; B Factor = Soil management system, with the graduations: b 1 = clean cultivation management of 1 cm wide stripe, along the tree row; b 2 = the same management of another stripe like in b 1 by mulching resulted from the grass mowing; C Factor = N rate, with the graduations: c 1 = N 0; c 2 = N 150; c 3 = N 100; c 4 = N 150; c 5 = N 200. The experiment was arranged in the field following the subdivided blocks method with the systematic design of A, B factors in 4 replications. The nitrogen was annually applied as ammonium <b>azotate.</b> P and K fertilization was evenly done over the whole acreage every 2 - 3 years. In 2011, after 22 years of B, C experimental factors involvement, pH values and P, K contents were registered. On an average, for the 3 soil management systems and 5 N fertilization levels on 0 - 10 cm versus 10 - 20 cm depth, pH value was significantly lower by 2. 3 % and P, K contents very significantly higher by 96 % and 30. 6 % respectively. The soil management by mulching versus the other 2 management systems lead to a significant increase of P content by 48 - 78 % and of K content by 42 - 62 %. An increase of N rate versus to No treatment brought about a general decrease of pH values and certainly of P and K content. The data reported in this paper can be utilized for the selection of an adequate management system and of optimum N rates which {{are going to be}} applied in the plum orchards located on soil types with close properties to the experimental soil...|$|E
