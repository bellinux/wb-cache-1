The invention includes an outer annular housing, a center element, {{and at least}} one intermediate annular element. The outer annular housing includes an inlet end attachable to an inlet pipe and an outlet end attachable to an outlet pipe.

It {{is available from}} [URL] Doi: 10. 1016 /j. euromechflu. 2003. 08. 004 Metadata only entryWe consider the local convective and absolute instabilities of the boundary layer on a rotating sphere located in a uniform <b>axial</b> <b>flow,</b> extending our previous work, which considered still outer fluid. <b>Axial</b> <b>flow</b> is seen to stabilise the convective instabilities, and our predicted onset of the spiral vortices is in good agreement with existing experimental data. The vortex angle is found to increase at each latitude with increased <b>axial</b> <b>flow,</b> as does the number of vortices. Results are presented that indicate that the latitude at which “slow” vortices first replace stationary vortices is slightly increased with <b>axial</b> <b>flow.</b> The results of our absolute instability analysis show that <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> delays the onset of absolute instability at each latitude, and the maximum absolute growth rates are found to reduce with increased <b>axial</b> <b>flow.</b> The onset of absolute instability {{is found to be}} much more sensitive to <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> than is the onset of convective instabilities...|$|R

40|$|The {{elliptic}} {{instability of}} a Batchelor vortex {{subject to a}} stationary strain field is considered by theoretical and numerical means in the regime of large Reynolds number and small <b>axial</b> <b>flow.</b> In the theory, the elliptic instability {{is described as a}} resonant coupling of two quasi-neutral normal modes (Kelvin modes) of the Batchelor vortex of azimuthal wavenumbers m and m + 2 with the underlying strain field. The growth rate associated with these resonances is computed for different values of the azimuthal wavenumbers as the <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> parameter is varied. We demonstrate that the resonant Kelvin modes m= 1 and m=− 1 which are the most unstable in the absence of <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> become damped as the <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> is increased. This is shown to be due to the appearance of a critical layer which damps one of the resonant Kelvin modes. However, the elliptic instability does not disappear. Other combinations of Kelvin modes m=− 2 and m= 0, then m=− 3 and m=− 1 are shown to become progressively unstable for increasing <b>axial</b> <b>flow.</b> A complete instability diagram is obtained {{as a function of the}} <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> parameter for several values of the strain rate and Reynolds number...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Taylor-Couette {{problem is}} a {{fundamental}} model in bifurcation theory and hydrodynamic stability. The inner cylinder rotation generates a flow pattern known by a transition to turbulence through a sequence of successive hydrodynamic instabilities. The effect of an imposed <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> on the instabilities evolution is studied. An experimental device was designed to study this effect. It consists of two concentric cylinders with the inner one rotating and the outer one fixed, and a pressure driven <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> can be superimposed in the annulus. In addition, various motion of the inner cylinder can also be imposed (oscillation, gradual or abrupt disturbance). The objectives are to investigate {{the effect of the}} superposition of an <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> on the stability of the flow and its influence on the vortex behavior and hence on the wall shear stress. The resulting structure of the flow then depends on the initial flow regime, due to the rotation of the inner cylinder and the velocity of the <b>axial</b> <b>flow.</b> Consequently, two dimensionless parameters are defined to characterize the flows: the Taylor number and the Reynolds number of the <b>axial</b> <b>flow.</b> Experimental PIV measurements are devoted to characterize the Taylor-Couette flow dynamics with imposed <b>axial</b> <b>flow</b> and then synchronized with electrochemical measurements to study the vortex-wall interaction...|$|R
