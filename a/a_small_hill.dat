5|$|As part of Oslo's bid to {{host the}} FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011, it was {{necessary}} to build a normal hill, as Holmenkollbakken only consists of a large hill. Several proposals were made, including converting Holmenkollbakken to a normal hill and building a large hill in Rødkleiva, or building a new hill in Holmenkollen and building <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hill</b> in Rødkleiva. Alternatively, a new small hill could be built at the location of the demolished Midtstubakken, next to Holmenkollbakken. City Councilor for Culture Anette Wiig Bryn (Progress Party) supported building a large hill in Rødkleiva and reducing Holmenkollbakken to <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hill.</b>|$|E
5|$|The present visitor centre, {{which opened}} in June 2007, is on <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hill</b> {{overlooking}} the reserve. It contains a café and shop, and is open daily. The reserve and hides are open at all times, with free access to NWT members, although non-members must buy a permit.|$|E
5|$|Østhorn has two platforms, {{each with}} a wooden shed. The sheds are {{designed}} by Arne Henriksen in a minimalist and standardised style with constructions of wood and steel. Østhorn serves the residential areas Korsvoll and Nordberg. The station {{is located at the}} bottom of <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hill</b> named Havnabakken, where local residents toboggan at winter's time.|$|E
50|$|To {{the west}} of Dytynets, there is <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>hill,</b> Dytynka, that is located between old neighborhoods of Dehtyari (Tarboilers), Honchari (Potters), and Kozhumyaki (Tanners).|$|R

50|$|As {{you leave}} the station, you climb up the 15 foot (4.572 m) lift hill. When you reach {{the top of the}} hill, you do a left {{downward}} bank turn, which takes your picture {{in the middle of the}} element. You climb up <b>a</b> <b>small</b> camelback <b>hill,</b> then <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>hill,</b> with <b>a</b> downward left helix, following a series of airtime bumps.|$|R
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>small</b> <b>hill</b> {{known as}} Bukit Puteri {{can be found}} nearby to Pasar Payang. The hill is about 200 metres high, located near the banks of Terengganu River. Because of its {{strategic}} location, it {{was used as a}} fortification by the sultans of the state. Old artefacts, a graveyard, and monuments can be found on top of the hill. During the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, a century-old brass bell known as genta will be rung to signify that it is time for iftar, or the end of the fasting on that day.|$|E
5|$|Bus. M-28 {{started at}} the top of <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hill</b> at an {{intersection}} with M-28 southwest of Newberry. The highway ran due north from the intersection along Engadine Road, running downhill towards Teaspoon Creek. Just south of the Tahquamenon River, Bus. M-28 turned east into the community of Dollarville. There the trunkline followed Dollarville Road and Engadine Road to the western city limits of Newberry.|$|E
5|$|During the engagement, 12 militiamen {{were killed}} by Band warriors while making a stand on <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hill.</b> The {{remainder}} of the militia fled back to Dixon's Ferry. Citizens erected a monument in 1901 in Stillman Valley, Illinois commemorating the battle. A 2006 article corroborates that militia volunteer Abraham Lincoln {{was present at the}} battleground's burials; sources agree about little else. Investigation continues in the early 21st century about facts of the skirmish.|$|E
5000|$|The {{name means}} [...] "Royal Hill". Slovak chlm, Czech chlum, Polish chełm {{are derived from}} a Proto-Slavic chъlmъ - a <b>hill,</b> chlmec - <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>hill,</b> <b>an</b> {{elevated}} location.|$|R
50|$|It rises {{south of}} Malnes. It can be climbed from Malnes {{starting}} about 500 m north of Tussen (elevation 198 m), <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>hill</b> directly above Norwegian County Road 915.|$|R
50|$|The castle hill saw human {{settlement}} and fortification efforts {{even before the}} construction of the medieval castle. Recovered evidence from earlier archaeological research on the hill top and its perimeter revealed the existence of <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>hill</b> fort of local Slavic tribes during the early Middle Ages.|$|R
5|$|On 2 September 1918 on {{the west}} bank of the River Jordan, Palestine, when his {{squadron}} was charging a strong enemy position, Ressaidar Badlu Singh realised that heavy casualties were being inflicted from <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hill</b> occupied by machine-guns and 200 infantry. Without any hesitation he collected six other ranks and with entire disregard of danger he charged and captured the position. He was mortally wounded on the very top of the hill when capturing one of the machine-guns single handed, but all the guns and infantry had surrendered to him before he died.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{are visible}} in stalls. Behind {{them is a}} {{crumbling}} wall with three low Romanesque windows. Four shepherds in contemporary 15th-century clothing are chatting amiably, leaning against the wall, looking into the shed. Two are positioned {{to the left and}} two to the right; in each pair one is dressed in red and an other in blue. Behind the shed is <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hill</b> where two shepherds herd sheep along a pathway, and beyond is a Netherlandish town with two domed structures in its center, symbolizing Jerusalem and Christ's Passion. The large domed building is based on the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem, a replica of which the Adornes family built in Bruges in 1427, called the Jerusalem chapel. A flock of geese is visible high in the sky through the roof's trusses.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, on the {{northern}} flank, the 10th Division was much more successful. Instead of waiting for orders from General Żeligowski, the commanding officer of the 10th Division, Lieutenant Colonel Wiktor Thommée, started a push along the southern bank of the Bugonarew. The 28th and 29th Kaniów Rifles Infantry Regiments managed to reach the village of Mokre, on <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hill</b> overlooking Radzymin and the Białystok-Warsaw road, directly behind the Russian lines. The Russians tried to push the Poles back from that position, but ultimately failed. Their assault on the village of Wiktorów also ended in failure. Soon the Polish positions in Mokre were secured, and further reinforced with {{the remainder of the}} 1st Battalion, 28th Regiment.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Garretson, set out of Guánica {{with his}} men towards Yauco with the {{intention}} of capturing the Yauco rail terminus that ran between that town and the City of Ponce, the largest city in the southern region of the island. Garretson and his men arrived in the darkness of night and was informed by his scouts of the possibility of a hostile situation at the Hacienda Desideria. He ordered the Illinois company and two companies (companies L and M) of the 6th Massachusetts to occupy <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hill</b> on his right that overlooked the hacienda.|$|E
5|$|The chapel, {{which is}} on <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hill</b> to the north east of the castle, was rebuilt in stone in the early 15th century. It was {{modified}} from the late 15th to late 16th century, when a Perpendicular Gothic, five-light east window and transepts were added. Bucks' engraving of 1728, shows a short nave and a large six-light west window, and that the chapel was disused by this time, as it had no roof. The west façade of the chapel was later demolished and the chancel arch was built up {{to form a new}} one with a Gibbs surround. A bell-turret was added c.1805. On the north and south sides of the chapel are two transeptal, semi-octagonal bays.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also a}} woodland, {{a former}} Forestry Commission plantation, planted around 1960 in the {{north-eastern}} corner of the park on <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hill,</b> which contains a circular folly tower, of three storeys, in the centre. The tower, built from red sandstone, is believed to date to the late 18th century. The northern side is considerably more eroded by the weather than the southern side. The tower is marginally wider at the base and has no internal floor structure, but contains holes for floor joists and stair treads. There are four windows on the ground floors and narrower windows higher up.|$|E

50|$|A large modern {{sports arena}} for basketball, volleyball, boxing, wrestling, judo and more was opened on 8 March 2008. Its cost is {{estimated}} to 16 mln lev. There is also a skiing centre in Samokov for Cross Country skiing, <b>a</b> <b>small</b> alpine <b>hill</b> and <b>a</b> snowboard park. Bulgaria's only ski jumping hill Chernia kos is located in Samokov. It's <b>a</b> fairly <b>small</b> <b>hill,</b> K-40 metres where you can jump down to 45 metres. The hill is very old {{and needs to be}} renovated.|$|R
50|$|The ride starts by {{climbing}} to {{a height of}} 75 feet. After <b>a</b> <b>small</b> drop and <b>a</b> curve, riders are taken down a steep 68 foot drop and <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>hill.</b> They then experience two corkscrew inversions, {{the highlight of the}} ride. The coaster ends in several high-speed turns and helices, followed by a long brake run and a curve into the station. Most riders experience pain due to the shape of the restraints and the corkscrew inversions.|$|R
5|$|Amésqueta left Mopán {{three days}} after Díaz and {{followed}} Díaz’s trail to the lakeshore. He arrived at the lake over a week later with 36 men. As they scouted along the south shore near Nojpetén they were shadowed by about 30 Itza canoes and more Itzas approached by land but kept a safe distance. Amésqueta was extremely suspicious of the small canoes being offered by the Itza to transport his party across to Nojpetén; as nightfall approached Amésqueta retreated from the lakeshore and his men took up positions on <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hill</b> nearby. In {{the early hours of}} the morning he ordered a retreat by moonlight. At San Pedro Martír he received news of an Itza embassy to Mérida in December 1695, and an apparent formal surrender of the Itza to Spanish authority. Unable to reconcile the news with the loss of his men, and with appalling conditions in San Pedro Mártir, Amésqueta abandoned his unfinished fort and retreated to Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|Amésqueta was {{extremely}} {{suspicious of the}} small canoes being supplied, knowing that the Itza had 30-man canoes; he was also aware that tricking enemies into small canoes was a favoured tactic among the lowland Maya to separate and kill Spanish intruders. He suspected that AjK'ixaw had betrayed them {{and that this was}} precisely what had happened to Díaz and his men. As nightfall approached, low on rations, in a vulnerable location and with no sign of Díaz and his men, Amésqueta retreated from the lakeshore and his men took up positions on <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hill</b> nearby. In {{the early hours of the}} morning he ordered a retreat by moonlight, using just a few torches. They arrived back at Chakal on 25 March and from there retreated to San Pedro Mártir on 9 April, beset by worsening conditions, a hurricane, sickness and rumours of enemies. The battered expedition set up a base camp nine leagues (approximately 23.4miles or 37.7km) north of Mopan.|$|E
5|$|In {{the town}} of West Bloomfield, US20 and NY5 go unnamed as they proceed eastward. Roughly one mile from the county line in the hamlet of West Bloomfield, US20 and NY5 meet the {{southern}} terminus of NY65. Exiting the hamlet, US20 and NY5 head through another area dominated by open land, intersecting Elton Road before passing seamlessly into East Bloomfield. A {{mile and a half}} from the town line, US20 and NY5 intersect NY64, a road running northwest–southeast from the Monroe County line south to US20 and NY5. NY64, whose right-of-way ends at US20 and NY5 at the foot of <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hill,</b> joins the two routes eastward on a triple overlap, entering the village of Bloomfield and intersecting the southern terminus of NY444 south of the portion of Bloomfield once known as Holcomb. Near the junction with NY444, US20, NY5 and NY64 take on a due east alignment, absorbing the routing used by Gauss Road west of this point.|$|E
50|$|Before 1973, Stabæk IF {{operated}} <b>a</b> <b>small</b> {{ski jumping}} <b>hill</b> named Gjønnesbakken. It was {{located on the}} <b>small</b> <b>hill</b> Gjønnesåsen northwest of the farm.|$|R
50|$|The Word dubeibat in Arabic is a plural of Dubeiba, {{which is}} a {{diminutive}} of Dabba, meaning a hummock or <b>a</b> flat <b>small</b> <b>hill.</b> Thus Dubaybat means the small hummocks.|$|R

5|$|Lützow {{was posted}} {{missing in action}} {{following}} combat on 24 April 1945 while attempting to intercept an attack by United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Martin B-26 Marauder medium bombers near Donauwörth. According to Stockert, an examination of U.S. records by Mr. Hirst indicates that Lützow's Me262 crashed near Schrobenhausen. The USAAF flew three attacks against the oil terminals at Schrobenhausen, south of Neuburg an der Donau, that day. On their second mission, 22 B-26 bombers escorted by 16 Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighter aircraft, were just beginning their bomb run at 3:25pm, when they came under attack by four Me262s. Two P-47s came diving down from their top cover position {{to fend off the}} attacking jets. In this account, one Me262 pilot noticed {{that he was about to}} come under attack and attempted to dive away. Unable to recover from this dive, the American pilots observed the Me262 crashing into <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hill.</b> This Me262 may have been piloted by Lützow.|$|E
5|$|The assault {{began at}} {{daylight}} on 27 March; the 8th Squadron {{moved across the}} plain to Kusr, where their progress was stopped by heavy Turkish small arms fire. The squadron formed a defensive line, while the 1st Squadron moved past them {{on the right and}} captured <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hill.</b> Turkish artillery and machine-gun fire grew heavier all day, and another attempt by the 8th Squadron to move forward at 16:00 also failed. At 19:25 the Turks counter-attacked the 1st Squadron, but were forced to retire. That night patrols were sent to reconnoitre the Turkish positions, so they could be more easily attacked the next day. At dawn on 28 March the entire division tried another attack. The 1st Squadron managed to capture a small trench, but without their artillery support they were unable to move any further forward in the face of heavy Turkish machine-gun fire. All that day and night they managed to hold onto what they had won, waiting for reinforcement to continue the attack.|$|E
5|$|The privateers {{arrived at}} Old Panama City on 27 January 1671; they camped {{overnight}} before attacking the following day. They were opposed by approximately 1,200 Spanish infantry and 400 cavalry; most were inexperienced. Morgan sent a 300-strong party of men down a ravine {{that led to}} the foot of <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>hill</b> on the Spanish right flank. As they disappeared from view, the Spanish front line thought the privateers were retreating, and the left wing broke rank and chased, followed by the remainder of the defending infantry. They were met with well-organised firing from Morgan's main force of troops. When the party came into view {{at the end of the}} ravine, they were charged by the Spanish cavalry, but organised fire destroyed the cavalry and the party attacked the flank of the main Spanish force. In an effort to disorganise Morgan's forces, the governor of Panama released two herds of oxen and bulls onto the battlefield; scared by the noise of the gunfire, they turned and stampeded over their keepers and some of the remaining Spanish troops. The battle was a rout: the Spanish lost between 400 and 500 men, against 15 privateers killed.|$|E
50|$|In 2001 {{the first}} ski jumping hill in Eschbach was built. It was only <b>a</b> <b>small</b> K-20 <b>hill,</b> {{and it was}} torn down {{after three years of}} use.|$|R
50|$|The place-name {{elements}} 'Knowe' and 'Knol' {{are derived}} from the Old English 'Cnoll' meaning <b>a</b> <b>small</b> rounded <b>hill,</b> hillock or mound, sometimes associated with tales of the fairies.|$|R
