5|$|Another key {{elements}} to Durkheim's theory {{of knowledge is}} his concept of représentations collectives (collective representations), which is outlined in The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life. Représentations collectives are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or any number of material items that {{can serve as a}} symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, représentations collectives are created through intense social interaction and <b>are</b> <b>products</b> <b>of</b> collective activity. As such these representations have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual (since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole), and yet simultaneously within each individual of the society (by virtue of that individual's participation within society).|$|E
5|$|Incest and {{intersex}} {{is another}} theme in Middlesex. Eugenides examines the passionate feelings that siblings living in seclusion experience for each other. Milton and Tessie, second cousins, are conceived {{during the same}} night, hinting to the incest of Desdemona and Lefty. Desdemona and Lefty's incestuous relationship is a transgression of a powerful taboo, indicating that someone will suffer for their wrongs; in a way, Cal's intersex condition symbolizes this Greek hubris. In another incestuous relationship, Milton makes love to Tessie using a clarinet which he lovingly rubs against her; their incestuous relationship enables them to contribute mutated genes to their child Cal. Cal's mother interferes with fate by attempting to make her second child a daughter. Cal believes this interference {{was a factor in}} his being a hermaphrodite. Conversely, Cal's relationship with his brother, ChapterEleven, is indicative of the possible dissimilarities that <b>are</b> <b>products</b> <b>of</b> the biosocial.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the process}} that forms drumlins is not fully understood, their shape implies that they <b>are</b> <b>products</b> <b>of</b> the plastic {{deformation}} zone of ancient glaciers. It is believed that many drumlins were formed when glaciers advanced over and altered the deposits of earlier glaciers.|$|E
25|$|The {{refinery}} HDS feedstocks (naphtha, kerosene, diesel oil, {{and heavier}} oils) contain {{a wide range}} of organic sulfur compounds, including thiols, thiophenes, organic sulfides and disulfides, and many others. These organic sulfur compounds <b>are</b> <b>products</b> <b>of</b> the degradation of sulfur containing biological components, present during the natural formation of the fossil fuel, petroleum crude oil.|$|E

25|$|The {{remaining}} 13% of the population, {{known as}} allophones, are native speakers {{of more than}} 30 different languages. With the exception of Aboriginal peoples in Quebec (the Inuit, Huron,Mohawks, Iroquois, Abenaki, Montagnais, Cree, Innu, Ojibway etc.), the majority <b>are</b> <b>products</b> <b>of</b> recent immigration and often come to adopt either English or French as home languages.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{linguistics}} is not {{in accord}} with the tendency of the 19th century scholars to regard modern Greek dialects as the direct descendants of the dialects of ancient Greek. According to the latest findings of scholarship, modern Greek dialects <b>are</b> <b>products</b> <b>of</b> the dialect differentiation of Koine Greek, and, with the exception of Tsakonian, they have no correlation with the ancient dialects.|$|E
25|$|As the {{commutator}} subgroup {{is generated by}} commutators, a perfect group may contain elements that <b>are</b> <b>products</b> <b>of</b> commutators but not themselves commutators. Øystein Ore proved in 1951 that the alternating groups on five or more elements contained only commutators, and made the conjecture that this was so for all the finite non-abelian simple groups. Ore's conjecture was finally proven in 2008. The proof relies on the classification theorem.|$|E

25|$|One {{can perform}} two {{standard}} operations with numbers: add and multiply. Prime numbers are “atoms” {{with respect to}} multiplication: all positive non-zero numbers <b>are</b> <b>products</b> <b>of</b> them. Various famous problems in mathematics ask very difficult questions about relations between prime numbers and the second operation of addition. These problems include the abc conjecture which in concentrated form expresses certain generic fundamental features of problems of the so called Diophantine geometry.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} of cancer has undergone evolutionary changes as {{understanding of the}} underlying biological processes has increased. Tumor removal surgeries have been documented in ancient Egypt, hormone therapy and radiation therapy were developed in the late 19th Century. Chemotherapy, immunotherapy and newer targeted therapies <b>are</b> <b>products</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century. As new information about the biology of cancer emerges, treatments will be developed and modified to increase effectiveness, precision, survivability, and quality of life.|$|E
25|$|The deep {{canyons and}} sharp peaks of today's North Cascades scene <b>are</b> <b>products</b> <b>of</b> {{profound}} erosion. Running water has etched out {{the grain of}} the range, landslides have softened the abrupt edges, homegrown glaciers have scoured the peaks and high valleys and, during the Ice Age, the Cordilleran Ice Sheet overrode almost all the range and rearranged courses of streams. Erosion has written and still writes its own history in the mountains, but it has also revealed the complex mosaic of the bedrock.|$|E

25|$|Today's {{commercial}} {{variety of}} the common mushroom originally was a light brown color. In 1926, a Pennsylvania mushroom farmer found a clump of common mushrooms with white caps in his mushroom bed. As with the reception of white bread, it {{was seen as a}} more attractive food item and became very popular. Similar to the commercial development history of the navel orange and Red Delicious apple, cultures were grown from the mutant individuals, and most of the cream-colored store mushrooms marketed today <b>are</b> <b>products</b> <b>of</b> this 1926 chance natural mutation.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} atomic orbitals {{are those}} that are calculated for systems with a single electron, such as the hydrogen atom. An atom of any other element ionized down to a single electron is very similar to hydrogen, and the orbitals take the same form. In the Schrödinger equation for this system of one negative and one positive particle, the atomic orbitals are the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian operator for the energy. They can be obtained analytically, meaning that the resulting orbitals <b>are</b> <b>products</b> <b>of</b> a polynomial series, and exponential and trigonometric functions. (see hydrogen atom).|$|E
25|$|Among the b-bit numbers, {{the most}} {{difficult}} to factor in practice using existing algorithms are those that <b>are</b> <b>products</b> <b>of</b> two primes of similar size. For this reason, these are the integers used in cryptographic applications. The largest such semiprime yet factored was RSA-768, a 768-bit number with 232 decimal digits, on December 12, 2009. This factorization was a collaboration of several research institutions, spanning two years and taking the equivalent of almost 2000 years of computing on a single-core 2.2nbsp&GHz AMD Opteron. Like all recent factorization records, this factorization was completed with a highly optimized implementation of the general number field sieve run on hundreds of machines.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the oldest}} and most highly {{deformed}} ultramafic rocks which underwent laterization are found in the complex Precambrian shields in Brazil and Australia. Smaller highly deformed Alpine-type intrusives have formed laterite profiles in Guatemala, Colombia, Central Europe, India and Burma. Large thrust sheets of Mesozoic to Tertiary 251- to 65-million-year-old island arcs and continental collision zones underwent laterization in New Caledonia, Cuba, Indonesia and the Philippines. Laterites reflect past weathering conditions; laterites which are found in present-day non-tropical areas <b>are</b> <b>products</b> <b>of</b> former geological epochs, when that area was near the equator. Present-day laterite occurring outside the humid tropics are considered to be indicators of climatic change, continental drift or a combination of both.|$|E
25|$|Postmodernism {{describes}} a broad movement that {{developed in the}} mid- to late 20th century across philosophy, the arts, architecture and criticism which marked a departure from modernism. While encompassing {{a broad range of}} ideas, postmodernism is typically defined by an attitude of skepticism, irony or rejection toward grand narratives, ideologies and various tenets of universalism, including objective notions of reason, human nature, social progress, moral universalism, absolute truth, and objective reality. Instead, it asserts to varying degrees that claims to knowledge and truth <b>are</b> <b>products</b> <b>of</b> social, historical or political discourses or interpretations, and are therefore contextual or socially constructed. Accordingly, postmodern thought is broadly characterized by tendencies to epistemological and moral relativism, pluralism, irreverence and self-referentiality.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary {{psychology}} (or {{more specifically}} evolutionary psychopathology or psychiatry) {{has also been}} proposed as an overall theory, positing that many mental disorders involve the dysfunctional operation of mental modules adapted to ancestral physical or social environments but not necessarily to modern ones. Other theories suggest that mental illness could have evolutionary advantages for the species, including in enhancing creativity. Some related behavioral abnormalities {{have been found in}} non-human great apes. Evolutionary psychology applies Darwinian principles to human behavior by saying that human minds <b>are</b> <b>products</b> <b>of</b> natural selection and have specific functions. Humans strive to carry on their genetic legacy through their offspring. This theory identifies the environment as having a great effect on a person's mental development.|$|E
