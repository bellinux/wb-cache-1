Section III(C) (3) of the General Preamble further explains that <b>contingency</b> <b>measures</b> should consist of other available control measures, beyond those necessary to meet the core moderate area control requirement to implement reasonably available control measures (RACM) [see Section 172 (a) (1) (c) of the Act] and, therefore, beyond those reasonably required to expeditiously attain the standards (see 57 FR 13543). Section 172 (c) (9) of the Act specifies that <b>contingency</b> <b>measures</b> shall “take effect … without further action by the State, or the [EPA] Administrator. ” EPA has interpreted this latter requirement [in the General Preamble (at 57 FR 13512) ] to mean that no further rulemaking activities by the state or EPA would be needed to implement the <b>contingency</b> <b>measures.</b> In general, EPA expects all actions, needed to affect full implementation of the <b>contingency</b> <b>measures,</b> to occur within 60 days after EPA notifies the state of its failure to timely attain the NAAQS or make RFP. EPA recognizes that certain actions, such as notification of sources, modification of permits, etc., may be needed before some measures could be implemented. However, states must show that their <b>contingency</b> <b>measures</b> can be implemented with minimal further administrative action on their part and with no additional rulemaking actions such as public hearings or legislative review...|$|R

With positron emission tomography we measured regional cerebral blood flow in nine subjects performing a control task and two delayed matching to sample tasks, in which the subjects were matching colours and patterns to a reference picture. The second of the two delayed matching tasks had a more complex instruction than the first, with <b>additional</b> <b>contingencies</b> of how to alternate between the matching of colours and patterns.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out in Ruwa to assess the town’s water {{allocation}} capacity and drought <b>contingency</b> <b>measures.</b> Structured questionnaires and interviews were used to collect data from 60 residents and selected key respondents. The results showed that Ruwa dormitory town did not have an independent water supply system and was linked to the City of Harare water supply system. Water storage facilities at Ruwa consisted of one, 2, 000 m 3 reinforced concrete ground reservoir and the other, 1800 m 3 braithwaithe tank on a 12 m high stand. Some 16. 6 % of the residents (n= 60) had unprotected illegal wells dug on their stands to supplement water during needy times. Ruwa Local Board had a total of five boreholes to supplement the piped water system within the town. Water supply rate by the Board has been increasing from 8, 671 cubic metres in 1987 to a peak of 797, 216 cubic metres in 1998. Drought <b>contingency</b> <b>measures</b> in the town included sinking of shallow wells, pressure reduction, restriction of use of hosepipes and water rationing. The Board had {{to increase the number of}} boreholes and install an independent water supply as drought <b>contingency</b> <b>measures.</b> It is recommended that the council should employ qualified personnel in the works department, who should put in place water consumption monitoring measures and improve on communication with residence in order to reduce confrontations...|$|R

40|$|An 8 · 2 m diameter, 37 · 5 m deep shaft {{has been}} {{successfully}} constructed from within {{the basement of a}} new development, Moorhouse, near Moorgate in the City of London. Programme constraints led to the shaft being constructed after completion of the foundations, basements and most of the superstructure for the development. At its closest point the shaft is less than 2 m from the large-diameter piles that support Moorhouse, and the presence of these foundations placed tight constraints on acceptable ground movements associated with construction of the shaft. The depth of the shaft is such that it penetrates through stiff London Clay and is founded {{at the bottom of the}} Lambeth Group. The paper describes the <b>contingency</b> <b>measures</b> to deal with potentially difficult ground conditions, including the water-bearing layers of the Lambeth Group. The construction processes included a complex temporary works dewatering system around the shaft, with the option to carry out additional dewatering from within the shaft during excavation. Provision was also made for radial grouting to ‘restress’ the ground, to prevent long-term settlement of the Moorhouse piles, should the need arise.
