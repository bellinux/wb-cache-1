40|$|International {{shipping}} {{is a vital}} channel {{linking the}} world economy, particularly {{from the perspective of}} international commodity trade. The recently proposed carbon regulation in international shipping will not only affect the competitiveness of shipping lines, but will also have implications for the global economy. This paper adopts an energy-environmental version of the Global Trade Analysis Project referred to as GTAP-E to analyze the quantitative effects of <b>a</b> maritime <b>carbon</b> <b>tax</b> on the global economy by placing a special focus on containerizable commodities given their significant role in international trade. The major advantage of the GTAP-E model is that it can capture the effects of asymmetric changes in freight costs on different routes caused by the maritime <b>carbon</b> <b>tax.</b> Based on our numerical results, imposing <b>a</b> maritime <b>carbon</b> <b>tax</b> on international container shipping will not lead to a significant economic impact unless the tax level is high. China will suffer the greatest real GDP loss among all countries. Under a high level of global maritime <b>carbon</b> <b>tax</b> ($ 90 /tCO 2), the real GDP loss to China will be around 0. 02 %. The negative economic impacts on the European countries will be greater if <b>a</b> maritime <b>carbon</b> <b>tax</b> is imposed only on the European container exporting/importing routes, compared to the situation where <b>a</b> global maritime <b>carbon</b> <b>tax</b> is imposed on container shipping. Finally, the imposition of <b>a</b> maritime <b>carbon</b> <b>tax</b> will discourage distant container trade on the routes (origin-destination) "China-USA", "Rest of Asia-USA", and "South America-China"...|$|R

25|$|A {{large number}} of papers in the {{economics}} literature suggest that carbon taxes should be preferred to carbon trading (Carbon Trust, 2009). Counter-arguments to this are usually based on the possible preference that politicians may have for emissions trading compared with taxes (Bashmakov et al.., 2001). One of these is that emission permits can be freely distributed to polluting industries, rather than the revenues going to the government. In comparison, industries may successfully lobby to exempt themselves from <b>a</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>tax.</b> It is therefore argued that with emissions trading, polluters {{have an incentive to}} cut emissions, but if they are exempted from <b>a</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>tax,</b> they have no incentive to cut emissions (Smith, 2008, pp.56–57). On the other hand, freely distributing emission permits could potentially lead to corrupt behaviour (World Bank, 2010, p.268).|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Accountancy)) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management, School of Accountancy, 2014. At the 2009 Copenhagen climate-change talks South Africa {{proposed}} {{a reduction in}} greenhouse gas emissions by 34 % in 2020 and 42 % in 2025. This report is intended to research and conclude upon whether South Africa can practically implement <b>a</b> <b>carbon</b> emissions <b>tax</b> {{in order to reduce}} the amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emitted, as well as on whether the introduction of <b>a</b> <b>carbon</b> emissions <b>tax</b> would be an appropriate way in which to address the climate change problem and South Africa’s contribution thereto. The research undertaken is necessary as South Africa is a relatively large emitter of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases thereby contributing to the global problem of climate change which is caused by these emissions and if South Africa wants to honour its proposed reduction, a measure is needed in order to ensure South Africa reduces its harmful greenhouse gas emissions, of which the levying of <b>a</b> <b>carbon</b> emissions <b>tax</b> is researched as such a measure. The research, a detailed literature that identified potential areas of concern or negative impact on the economy and the identified ‘issues’ were when used in a correspondence survey to test the perception of professionals with a knowledge of the proposed <b>carbon</b> <b>tax.</b> The conclusion reached was that <b>a</b> <b>carbon</b> emissions <b>tax</b> cannot be successfully implemented at this time due to the prevailing economic conditions in South Africa as well as the potential resulting negative effects on the country’s low-income population and on South Africa’s international competitiveness. It is recommended that the possibility of implementing <b>a</b> <b>carbon</b> emissions <b>tax</b> should be re-evaluated at a future stage once the country’s economy is more developed...|$|R

25|$|Following two {{and half}} decades of {{economic}} reform and amidst booming trade with Asia, Australia—in stark contrast to most other Western nations—avoided recession following the 2008 collapse of financial markets. Following the 2010 election, the Gillard Government entered an alliance with the Australian Greens and was destabilized by breaking an election promise not to introduce <b>a</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>tax,</b> by leadership rivalry and by lacking the numbers to push some controversial legislation through the Parliament. Nevertheless, the cross-bench alliance continued to operate and though facing declining poll support and firm opposition from the Liberal-National Coalition, in October the government successfully passed its Clean Energy Bill 2011 aimed to restructure the Australian economy {{in order to reduce}} greenhouse gas emissions associated with global warming by increasing costs to industry for carbon emissions. <b>A</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>tax</b> was introduced in Australia on 1 July 2012.

30|$|This article {{compared}} the static {{efficiency of the}} consumption/emission allocation of three alternative emission control measures (proportional <b>carbon</b> <b>tax</b> (unilateral or universal) and emission trading)f. <b>A</b> unilateral <b>carbon</b> <b>tax,</b> akin to <b>a</b> symmetric Nash equilibrium of the worldwide consumption/emission game, is less efficient than bilateral carbon emission trading. Although <b>a</b> universal proportional <b>carbon</b> <b>tax,</b> into which the entire negative externalities of the emissions of a country are woven, achieves the Pareto efficient allocation, realizing such an ideal tax system at this time appears very difficult. That is because the tax rate would become extremely high, {{much higher than the}} incumbent tax rate or price of emission right. As such, gradualism seems inevitable. The transition from bilateral to multilateral emission trading is desirable. Thus, <b>a</b> universal proportional <b>carbon</b> <b>tax</b> should be considered as the ultimate solution, and an enabling political arena is needed to gradually establish the system.|$|R

40|$|<b>A</b> rapidly rising <b>carbon</b> <b>tax</b> {{leads to}} faster {{extraction}} {{of fossil fuels}} and accelerates global warming. We analyze how general equilibrium effects operating through the international capital market affect this Green Paradox. In a two-region, two-period world with identical homothetic preferences and without investment, the global interest rate falls and the Green Paradox weakens. With investment or a relatively more impatient oil-importing region, the Green Paradox may be strengthened because the future oil demand function shifts downward or because the interest rate rises. If the oil-importing region is very much more patient than the oil-exporting region, the Green Paradox may be reversed but in our calibrated model the effects are tiny. With exploration and endogenous initial oil reserves, <b>a</b> future <b>carbon</b> <b>tax</b> lowers cumulative oil extraction in partial equilibrium.
