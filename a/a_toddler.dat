30|$|The {{notion that}} <b>a</b> <b>toddler’s</b> play {{activity}} is configured subjectively in an affective relationship {{within a particular}} cultural, social and historical situational context, is widely understood (Elkonin 1978; Bozhovich 2009; Gonzalez-Rey 2009; van Oers 2010; Kravtsov and Kravtsova 2010). In addition, current research shows that participation in symbolic play activity is wholly embedded in <b>a</b> <b>toddler’s</b> daily life (Hedegaard 2008; Fleer 2010, 2014; Li et al. 2017). This {{is consistent with the}} context of the example to be discussed, where, embedded in a short walk with toddler Luci, symbolic play activity was videoed by researcher on a moblie phone. The transitory moment that was video captured, holds affective actions configured subjectively by toddler Luci. These actions reflect the cultural and historical elements that offer research insight into the broader context of <b>a</b> <b>toddler’s</b> symbolic play activity.|$|R
40|$|Under {{ordinary}} circumstances <b>a</b> <b>toddler's</b> {{fracture of}} the lower extremity is diagnosed by clinical evaluation and history. Often the initial conventional radiograph is unrevealing, but the fracture is diagnosed and treated based on appropriate clinical and laboratory findings. In rare instances, a patient with <b>an</b> unsuspected <b>toddler's</b> fracture may present with an atypical history, unusual physical findings, or laboratory values suggesting {{the presence of an}} inflammatory process. Skeletal scintigraphy in this small group of patients has been valuable in defining a spiral fracture of the midshaft of the tibia connected with <b>a</b> <b>toddler's</b> fracture.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>toddler</b> who is {{securely}} {{attached to his}} or her parent (or other familiar caregiver) will explore freely while the caregiver is present, typically engages with strangers, is often visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and is generally happy to see the caregiver return. The extent of exploration and of distress are affected, however, by the child's temperamental make-up and by situational factors as well as by attachment status. A child's attachment is largely influenced by their primary caregiver's sensitivity to their needs. Parents who consistently (or almost always) respond to their child's needs will create {{securely attached}} children. Such children are certain that their parents will be responsive to their needs and communications.|$|E

The participants in this study were 40 (female) caregivers who work with infants aged 6 months to 4 years old in private daycare. The findings indicate that experiencing a virtual world that reflects the real world of children improves, to some point, the caregiver’s awareness to the emotional experiences that the toddler undergoes in her/his first days in a kindergarten or daycare...|$|R
5|$|Andrew Dudley was one {{of three}} sons of Edmund Dudley, a {{councillor}} of King Henry VII, and his second wife Elizabeth Grey, daughter of Edward Grey, 4th Viscount Lisle. When he was <b>a</b> <b>toddler,</b> his father was executed by the young Henry VIII as a scapegoat for the former king's financial policies. His eldest brother was John Dudley, later Duke of Northumberland, who sought to advance him in the king's service. Andrew Dudley served in the household of Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, and as an officer of the exchequer in the 1540s. Answering a complaint against exchequer activities in October 1540, Norfolk told the Privy Council that the only two people he had ever found jobs for were Andrew Dudley and Edward Belingeham.|$|E
5|$|The term {{attachment}} {{disorder is}} used to describe emotional and behavioral problems of young children, and also applied to school-age children, teenagers and adults. The specific difficulties implied depend on {{the age of the}} individual being assessed, and a child's attachment-related behaviors may be very different with one familiar adult than with another, suggesting that the disorder is within the relationship and interactions of the two people rather than an aspect of one or the other personality. No list of symptoms can legitimately be presented but generally the term attachment disorder refers to the absence or distortion of age appropriate social behaviors with adults. For example, in <b>a</b> <b>toddler,</b> attachment-disordered behavior could include a failure to stay near familiar adults in a strange environment or to be comforted by contact with a familiar person, whereas in a six-year-old attachment-disordered behavior might involve excessive friendliness and inappropriate approaches to strangers.|$|E
5|$|Born in England, Brooks {{emigrated to}} Australia as <b>a</b> <b>toddler</b> and started {{swimming}} lessons after nearly drowning in a childhood accident. After initially being {{known for his}} lack of technique, Brooks quickly rose through the youth ranks. Brooks made his debut at the Australian Championships in 1976, {{but it was not}} until 1979 that he medalled at national level and made his debut for Australia at a FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation) Swimming World Cup meet. In 1980, he gained prominence by breaking the Australian record in the 100m freestyle and being invited to a national team camp. There he had his first clash with officialdom, walking out after accusing the officials of neglecting him. He then qualified for the Australian team for the 1980 Moscow Olympics, defying political pressure to boycott the Games in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Arriving in Moscow, Brooks' experience in the 100m freestyle was an unpleasant one, suffering an asthma attack and missing the final. The peak of his swimming career came in the 4100m medley relay, when he caught and passed the Soviet Union's Sergey Kopliakov during the anchor leg to seal a narrow victory for Australia. This victory remains the only time that the United States did not win the event at Olympic level.|$|E

5|$|Frank Arthur Worsley {{was born}} on 22 February 1872 in Akaroa, New Zealand, one of three {{children}} of a farmer, Henry Worsley, and his wife Georgiana. His grandfather, Henry Francis Worsley (1806–1876), had migrated from Rugby in England aboard the Cornwall to Lyttelton, where he arrived with his large family in December 1851. The family lived in Grehan Valley, high up above Akaroa. Worsley's mother died while he was <b>a</b> <b>toddler.</b> He was sent to school in Akaroa but when his father moved his family to take up work clearing bush from land at Peraki, he was homeschooled for a time. From age 10, he helped with clearing land for sheep pasture and growing cocksfoot. When Frank was 11, his older brother, Harry, left to join the New Zealand Shipping Company as an apprentice and {{at about the same}} time, his father moved his family, which was now just Frank and his 13-year-old sister, to Christchurch. Frank attended Fendalton School and marked his final year of schooling by being made head boy.|$|E
5|$|John Herschel Glenn Jr. {{was born}} on July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, Ohio, the son of John Herschel Glenn Sr., who worked for a {{plumbing}} firm, and Clara Teresa , a teacher. His parents had married shortly before his father, {{a member of the}} American Expeditionary Force, left for the Western Front during World War I. The family moved to New Concord, Ohio, soon after his birth, and his father started his own plumbing company, the Glenn Plumbing Company. He was only <b>a</b> <b>toddler</b> when he met Anna Margaret (Annie) Castor, who would later become his wife. The two {{would not be able to}} recall a time when they did not know each other. He took his first flight in an airplane with his father when he was eight years old. He became fascinated by flight, and built model airplanes from balsa wood kits. Along with his adopted sister Jean, he attended New Concord Elementary School. He washed cars and sold rhubarb to earn money to buy a bicycle, after which he took a job delivering The Columbus Dispatch newspaper. He was a member of the Ohio Rangers, an organisation similar to the Cub Scouts; Annie was a girl scout. His boyhood home in New Concord has been restored as a historic house museum and education center.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{contrasting}} views {{regarding the}} marital status of Tulsidas. According to the Mula Gosain Charita {{and some other}} works, Tulsidas was married to Ratnavali on the thirteenth day of the bright half of the Jyeshta month (May–June) in Vikram 1583 (1526 CE). Ratnavali {{was the daughter of}} Dinbandhu Pathak, a Brahmin of the Bharadwaja Gotra, who belonged to Mahewa village of Kaushambi district. They had a son named Tarak who died as <b>a</b> <b>toddler.</b> Once when Tulsidas had gone to a Hanuman temple, Ratnavali went to her father's home with her brother. When Tulsidas came to know this, he swam across the Yamuna river in the night to meet his wife. Ratnavali chided Tulsidas for this, and remarked that if Tulsidas was even half as devoted to God as he was to her body of flesh and blood, he would have been redeemed. Tulsidas left her instantly and left for the holy city of Prayag. Here, he renounced the Grihastha (householder's life) stage and became a Sadhu (Hindu ascetic).|$|E

30|$|Toddlers orient {{themselves}} to their immediate world, over the passing rhythm of days and nights. Their immediate world, often contained in a transitory moment, may be overlooked. It is in cultural - historical research, that ethical considerations of historic values, emotions, and familial social settings, are provided in finer detail, in order to acknowledge those influences on learning. Toddlers generally make meaningful personal connections as they become increasingly familiar with the complex reality of what is present, both in and around them. Educators, peers, family, and toddlers’ interactive experiences, may also involve strong and diverse feelings connected to their surrounding reality. This can include perceived smells, sounds, sights, spaces, and materials. These richly complex elements present in daily interactions, form the toddler’s “phenomena of reality” as noted by Bozhovich (2009, p. 2). Such phenomena may be considered fertile ground for growth of <b>a</b> <b>toddler’s</b> abstract thinking, because they draw upon the toddler’s foundational historical experiences and personal awareness. The growth of symbolic activity in <b>a</b> playful <b>toddler,</b> can therefore be more fully understood, when investigated {{in the light of}} its historical development. Historical development is the basis of the research process that gives thought to the reconstruction of a very young child’s mental function and how the toddler actually moves towards … “using a sign as a means for organizing behaviour” (Vygotsky 2004, p. 39). As such, an historical study of <b>a</b> <b>toddler’s</b> learning does require accounting for the dynamic movement that may be hidden in transitory moments of <b>a</b> <b>toddler’s</b> rapid and responsive actions (Vygotsky 1997). Researchers Quinones et al. (2017, p. 176), visually identify and theorise transitory moments in their research data on infants and toddlers as “moments of affective action”. In this article, the transitory moments of toddler initiated activity are identified from the toddler’s perspective, and understood as being afffective and temporal in nature.|$|R

5|$|The more {{positive}} emotions and behavior that a 12- to 24-month-old toddler displays when coping with separation from a parent, the better s/he is 3.5 years later at using cooling strategies {{in order to}} delay gratification. This suggests that the emotional skills and processes required for coping with social and interpersonal frustrations {{are similar to those}} utilized for coping with the aggravation of goal-directed delay of gratification. Maternal attachment also influences the development of a child's ability to delay gratification. An interaction has been found between a mother's level of control and how close a child stays to the mother while exploring the environment. Children who have controlling mothers and explore their environment at a far distance from her are able to employ more cooling strategies and delay rewards longer. Similarly, children who stay close to a non-controlling mothers also use more cool strategies and demonstrate longer delays. This suggests that some children of controlling mothers have better learned how to distract themselves from or effectively avoid intrusive stimuli, although additional effects on their emotional competency are speculated but unknown. A greater capacity to delay gratification by using effective attentional strategies is also seen in preschoolers whose mothers had been responsive and supportive during particularly stressful times of self-regulation when the child was <b>a</b> <b>toddler,</b> indicating that maternal responsiveness during highly demanding times is crucial for the development of self-regulation, self-control and emotional competency.|$|E
