40|$|A laser {{spectrometer}} for automated monthly {{measurements of}} methane (CH 4) mixing ratios aboard the CARIBIC passenger aircraft is presented. The instrument {{is based on}} a commercial Fast Greenhouse Gas Analyser (FGGA, Los Gatos Res.), which was adapted to meet the requirements imposed by unattended airborne operation. It was characterised in the laboratory with respect to instrument stability, precision, cross sensitivity to H 2 O, and accuracy. For airborne operation, a calibration strategy is described that utilises CH 4 measurements obtained from flask samples taken during the same flights. The precision of airborne measurements is 2 ppb for 10 s averages. The accuracy at aircraft cruising altitude is 3. 85 ppb. During <b>aircraft</b> <b>ascent</b> and descent, where no flask samples were obtained, instrumental drifts can be less accurately determined and the uncertainty is estimated to be 12. 4 ppb. A linear humidity bias correction was applied to the CH 4 measurements, which was most important in the lower troposphere. On average, the correction bias was around 6. 5 ppb at an altitude of 2 km, and negligible at cruising flight level. Observations from 103 long-distance flights are presented that span {{a large part of the}} northern hemispheric upper troposphere and lowermost stratosphere (UT/LMS), with occasional crossing of the tropics on flights to southern Africa. These accurate data mark the largest UT/LMS in-situ CH 4 dataset worldwide.

Results of 9 <b>aircraft</b> <b>ascents</b> over Europe from 1978 - 1980 are reported. It is shown that the meteorological conditions at the tropopause level have an important influence on the observed SO 2 mixing ratio. The weak vertical SO 2 gradients in the upper troposphere suggest only a small flux of tropospheric SO 2 into the stratosphere. Furthermore, increasing SO 2 mixing ratios within the first kilometers of the stratosphere give strong support to a stratospheric SO 2 source due to the oxidation of organic sulfur compounds (COS, CS 2).

40|$|Typical damage modes {{in light}} {{honeycomb}} sandwich structures include face sheet/core disbonding and core fracture, {{both of which}} can {{pose a threat to}} the structural integrity of a component. These damage modes are of particular interest to aviation certification authorities since several in-service occurrences, such as rudder structural failure and other control surface malfunctions, have been attributed to face sheet/core disbonding. Extensive studies have shown that face sheet/core disbonding and core fracture can lead to damage propagation caused by internal pressure changes in the core. The increasing use of composite sandwich construction in aircraft applications makes it vitally important to understand the effect of ground-air-ground (GAG) cycles and conditions such as maneuver and gust loads on face sheet/core disbonding. The objective {{of the present study was}} to use a fracture mechanics based approach developed earlier to evaluate the loading at the disbond front caused by ground-air-ground pressurization and in-plane loading. A honeycomb sandwich panel containing a circular disbond at one face sheet/core interface was modeled with three-dimensional (3 D) solid finite elements. The disbond was modeled as a discrete discontinuity and the strain energy release rate along the disbond front was computed using the Virtual Crack Closure Technique (VCCT). Special attention was paid to the pressure-deformation coupling which can decrease the pressure load within the disbonded sandwich section significantly when the structure is highly deformed. The commercial finite element analysis software, Abaqus/Standard, was used for the analyses. The recursive pressure-deformation coupling problem was solved by representing the entrapped air in the honeycomb cells as filled cavities in Abaqus/Standard. The results show that disbond size, face sheet thickness and core thickness are important parameters that determine crack tip loading at the disbond front. Further, the pressure-deformation coupling was found to have an important load decreasing effect [6]. In this paper, a detailed problem description is provided first. Second, the analysis methodology is presented. The fracture mechanics approach used is described and the specifics of the finite element model, including the fluid-filled cavities, are introduced. Third, the initial model verification and validation are discussed. Fourth, the findings from a closely related earlier study [6] are summarized. These findings provided the basis for the current investigation. Fifth, an <b>aircraft</b> <b>ascent</b> scenario from 0 to 12192 m (0 to 40000 ft) is considered and the resulting crack tip loading at the disbond front is determined. In-plane loading to simulate maneuvers and gust conditions are also considered. Sixth, the results are shown for a curved panel, which was used to simulate potential fuselage applications.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} gridded climatology {{of carbon}} monoxide (CO) has been developed by trajectory mapping of global MOZAIC-IAGOS in situ measurements from commercial aircraft data. CO measurements made during <b>aircraft</b> <b>ascent</b> and descent, comprising nearly 41   200 profiles at 148 airports worldwide from December  2001 to December  2012, are used. Forward and backward trajectories are calculated from meteorological reanalysis data in order to map the CO measurements to other locations and so {{to fill in the}} spatial domain. This domain-filling technique employs 15   800   000 calculated trajectories to map otherwise sparse MOZAIC-IAGOS data into a quasi-global field. The resulting trajectory-mapped CO data set is archived monthly from 2001 to 2012 on a grid of 5 ° longitude [*]×[*]  5 ° latitude [*]×[*]  1  km altitude, from the surface to 14  km altitude. The mapping product has been carefully evaluated, firstly by comparing maps constructed using only forward trajectories and using only backward trajectories. The two methods show similar global CO distribution patterns. The magnitude of their differences is most commonly 10  % or less and found to be less than 30  % for almost all cases. Secondly, the method has been validated by comparing profiles for individual airports with those produced by the mapping method when data from that site are excluded. While there are larger differences below 2  km, the two methods agree very well between 2 and 10  km with the magnitude of biases within 20  %. Finally, the mapping product is compared with global MOZAIC-IAGOS cruise-level data, which {{were not included in the}} trajectory-mapped data set, and with independent data from the NOAA aircraft flask sampling program. The trajectory-mapped MOZAIC-IAGOS CO values show generally good agreement with both independent data sets. Maps are also compared with version 6 data from the Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere (MOPITT) satellite instrument. Both data sets clearly show major regional CO sources such as biomass burning in Central and southern Africa and anthropogenic emissions in eastern China. While the maps show similar features and patterns, and relative biases are small in the lowermost troposphere, we find differences of [*]∼[*]  20  % in CO volume mixing ratios between 500 and 300  hPa. These upper-tropospheric biases are not related to the mapping procedure, as almost identical differences are found with the original in situ MOZAIC-IAGOS data. The total CO trajectory-mapped MOZAIC-IAGOS column is also higher than the MOPITT CO total column by 12 – 16  %. The data set shows the seasonal CO cycle over different latitude bands and altitude ranges as well as long-term trends over different latitude bands. We observe a decline in CO over the northern hemispheric extratropics and the tropics consistent with that reported by previous studies using other data sources.

50|$|Very {{little was}} known about the upper {{atmosphere}} {{in the years immediately}} following the World War. The lapse rate in the troposphere was well known from balloon and <b>aircraft</b> <b>ascents.</b> The stratosphere had been discovered by Teisserenc de Bort in 1899, and the tropopause located at an altitude of 10 or 12 km. It was thought that each atmospheric constituent was then distributed independently according to its molecular weight, so that eventually, above about 100 km, the lighter gases, hydrogen and helium, would predominate. This was the basis for von der Borne's explanation of the return of sound to the ground. This explanation was attacked on the ground that the very low atmospheric pressure at high levels would remove most of the energy from the sound wave. Erwin Schrödinger showed that this was not the case, since the amplitude of motion would increase to maintain the energy of the wave, although there would be absorption, as predicted by Rayleigh. However, the altitude required was much too high to transmit sound without excessive attenuation, and so there was still a difficulty.|$|R

Almost continuously activated since mid- 2001, the CHAllenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) GPS RO experiment provides up to 200 vertical atmospheric profiles per day. In this paper, we intercompare CHAMP RO humidity results and analyses from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) with coinciding Measurement of OZone and water vapor by AIrbus in-service airCraft (MOZAIC) data collected during <b>aircraft</b> <b>ascents</b> and descents.

On the other hand, the standard deviation between MOZAIC and CHAMP humidity is slightly higher than that between MOZAIC and ECMWF through the entire altitude range. Apart from the water vapor validation (ascent and descent data), we also compare MOZAIC cruise data at an altitude of typically 10 - 11 km with CHAMP refractivity and temperature results (dry retrieval), and corresponding ECMWF analysis data.

In this work we developed a fast-response detector of ethylene based on laser photo-acoustic spectroscopy (LPAS) and used it onboard the NOAA WP- 3 D aircraft to measure ethylene in industrial plumes around Houston in the summer of 2006. The new LPAS instrument was evaluated by comparison with measurement results from a whole air sampler (WAS), and the two measurements agreed within the combined measurement uncertainties. Emission fluxes of ethylene were estimated (1) by integrating the measured ethylene concentration across the width of industrial plumes, (2) by multiplying the concentration with the orthogonal wind speed measured from the aircraft, and (3) by assuming that the emissions are homogeneously distributed across the height of the boundary layer as estimated using <b>aircraft</b> <b>ascents</b> and descents. The estimated ethylene fluxes were compared with the results of simultaneous Solar Occultation Flux (SOF) measurements inside a mobile laboratory, and the agreement was within a factor of 2. Previous work had indicated that current inventories underestimate alkene emissions in Houston by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude. These findings were confirmed both by the aircraft and SOF measurements. The measured mixing ratios of ethylene were compared between the results from 2006 and an earlier mission in 2000.

In general, aerosol extinction values calculated from AATS- 6 AOD measurements acquired during aircraft profiles up to 5 km ASL reproduce the vertical structure measured by coincident aircraft in-situ measurements of total aerosol number and surface area concentration. Calculations show that the spectral dependence of AOD was small (mean Angstrom wavelength exponents of approximately 0. 20) within three atmospheric layers defined as the total column beneath {{the top of each}} aircraft profile, the region beneath the trade wind inversion, and the region within the Saharan Air Layer (SAL) above the trade inversion. This spectral behavior is consistent with attenuation of incoming solar radiation by large dust particles or by dust plus sea salt. Values of CWV calculated from profile measurements by AATS- 6 at 941. 9 nm and from aircraft in-situ measurements by a chilled mirror dewpoint hygrometer agree to within approximately 4 % (0. 13 g/sq cm). AATS- 6 AOD values measured on the ground at Roosevelt Roads Naval Air Station and during low altitude aircraft runs over the adjacent Cabras Island aerosol/radiation ground site agree to within 0. 004 to 0. 030 with coincident data obtained with an AERONET Sun/sky Cimel radiometer located at Cabras Island. For the same observation times, AERONET retrievals of CWV exceed AATS- 6 values by a mean of 0. 74 g/sq cm (approximately 21 %) for the 2. 9 - 3. 9 g/sq cm measured by AATS- 6. Comparison of AATS- 6 aerosol extinction values obtained during four <b>aircraft</b> <b>ascents</b> over Cabras Island with corresponding values calculated from coincident aerosol backscatter measurements by a ground-based micro-pulse lidar (MPL-Net) located at Cabras yields a similar vertical structure above the trade inversion. Finally, AATS- 6 AOD values measured during low altitude aircraft traverses over the ocean are compared with corresponding AOD values retrieved over water from upwelling radiance measurements by the MODIS, TOMS, and GOES- 8 Imager satellite sensors, with mixed results.

40|$|The Puerto Rico Dust Experiment (PRIDE) was {{conducted}} during June/July of 2000 {{to study the}} properties of Saharan dust aerosols transported across the Atlantic Ocean to the Caribbean Islands. During PRIDE, the NASA Ames Research Center six-channel (380 - 1020 nm) airborne autotracking sunphotometer (AATS- 6) was operated aboard a Piper Navajo airplane alongside a suite of in situ aerosol instruments. The in situ aerosol instrumentation relevant to this paper included a Forward Scattering Spectrometer Probe (FSSP- 100) and a Passive Cavity Aerosol Spectrometer Probe (PCASP), covering the radius range of approx. 0. 05 to 10 microns. The simultaneous and collocated measurement of multi-spectral aerosol optical depth and in situ particle size distribution data permits a variety of closure studies. For example, vertical profiles of aerosol optical depth obtained during local <b>aircraft</b> <b>ascents</b> and descents can be differentiated with respect to altitude and compared to extinction profiles calculated using the in situ particle size distribution data (and reasonable estimates of the aerosol index of refraction). Additionally, aerosol extinction (optical depth) spectra can be inverted to retrieve estimates of the particle size distributions, which can be compared directly to the in situ size distributions. In this paper we will report on such closure studies using data from a select number of vertical profiles at Cabras Island, Puerto Rico, including measurements in distinct Saharan Dust Layers. Preliminary results show good agreement to within 30 % between mid-visible aerosol extinction derived from the AATS- 6 optical depth profiles and extinction profiles forward calculated using 60 s-average in situ particle size distributions and standard Saharan dust aerosol refractive indices published in the literature. In agreement with tendencies observed in previous studies, our initial results show an underestimate of aerosol extinction calculated based on the in situ size distributions relative to the extinction obtained from the sunphotometer measurements. However, a more extensive analysis of all available AATS- 6 and in situ size distribution data is necessary to ascertain whether the preliminary results regarding the degree of extinction closure {{is representative of the}} entire range of dust conditions encountered in PRIDE. Finally, we will compare the spectral extinction measurements obtained in PRIDE to similar data obtained in Saharan dust layers encountered above the Canary Islands during ACE- 2 (Aerosol Characterization Experiment) in July 1997.

40|$|The Puerto Rico Dust Experiment (PRIDE) was {{conducted}} during summer 2000 {{to study the}} radiative, microphysical and transport properties of Saharan dust in the Caribbean region. During PRIDE, NASA Ames Research Center's six-channel airborne autotracking sunphotometer (AATS- 6) was operated aboard a Piper Navajo airplane based at Roosevelt Roads Naval Station on the northeast coast of Puerto Rico. AATS- 6 measurements were taken during 21 science flights {{off the coast of}} Puerto Rico in the western Caribbean. Data were acquired within and above the Marine Boundary Layer (MBL) and the Saharan Aerosol Layer (SAL) up to 5. 5 km altitude tinder a wide range of dust loadings. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) spectra and columnar water vapor (CWV) values have been calculated from the AATS- 6 measurements by using sunphotometer calibration data obtained at Mauna Loa Observatory (3 A kin ASL) before (May) and after (October) PRIDE. Mid-visible AOD values measured near the surface during PRIDE ranged from 0. 07 on the cleanest day to 0. 55 on the most turbid day. Values measured above the MBL were as high as 0. 35; values above the SAL were as low as 0. 01. The fraction of total column AOD due to Saharan dust cannot be determined precisely from AATS- 6 AOD data alone due to the uncertainty in the extent of vertical mixing of the dust down through the MBL. However, analyses of ground-based and airborne in-situ aerosol sampling measurements and ground-based aerosol lidar backscatter data should yield accurate characterization of the vertical mixing that will enable calculation of the Saharan dust AOD component from the sunphotometer data. Examples will be presented showing measured AATS- 6 AOD spectra, calculated aerosol extinction and water vapor density vertical profiles, and aerosol size distributions retrieved by inversion of the AOD spectra.

Yet, in the absence of controlled studies, the link between land usage and bird strikes is largely anecdotal. In seeking a connection between bird strikes and land use, the records of reported bird strikes from the years 1990 - 2001 were examined for 28 airports in down-state Illinois. For each airport it was noted whether land use within 6 miles of the airports included large bodies of water or wetlands, wildlife sanctuaries, golf courses, landfills, shopping venues with food concessions, or croplands. Because most bird strikes reportedly occur in the course of <b>aircraft</b> takeoffs and <b>ascent</b> or <b>aircraft</b> descent and landing, aircraft operations (defined as takeoffs or landings) are taken to represent opportunities for bird strikes such as might be linked to surrounding land uses. This allows the creation of a comparative statistic for the number of aircraft operations per reported bird strike. Because bird strike reports are voluntary, no attempt is made to formulate a predictive statistic. However, it is noted that the largely rural down-state Illinois airports report bird strikes (as a function of aircraft operations) far less frequently than is indicated by a comparative national statistic.

40|$|The in situ cloud lidar is {{designed}} to measure cloud volumes of millions of cubic meters to overcome the sampling limitations of traditional cloud probes in inhomogeneous clouds. This technique sends laser pulses horizontally from an aircraft inside an optically thick cloud and measures the time series of the multiply scattered light with wide field-of-view detectors viewing upward and downward. The extinction in liquid clouds averaged over tens to hundreds of meters and the distance to cloud boundaries can be retrieved from the signal measured by a single-wavelength in situ lidar. This paper describes the design and operation of an in situ cloud lidar. A laser in the aircraft cabin outputs 532 -nm wavelength pulses at 10 Hz, which are sent through beam-expanding optics for eye safety. The upward- and downward-viewing detectors use photo-multiplier tubes and operate with either daytime (3 ° half angle; 0. 37 -nm solar-blocking filter) or nighttime (30 °) optics. Example daytime lidar signals in dense cloud have a dynamic range of 1000 after solar background subtraction. Results from a nighttime flight in marine stratus are analyzed in detail. The variations in the lidar signals with aircraft travel are much smoother for the longer photon travel times, indicating that the later times sample volumes hundreds of meters in size. Extinction retrievals for 25 -m-radius volumes have high correlation (R 2 0. 84) with Forward Scattering Spectrometer Probe (FSSP) -derived extinction, while the correlation is relatively low (R 2 0. 40) for 200 -m volumes due to cloud inhomogeneity. Lidar retrievals of cloud-base and-top height from inside the cloud are consistent with cloud boundaries obtained from <b>aircraft</b> penetrations on <b>ascents</b> and descents. 1...|$|R
