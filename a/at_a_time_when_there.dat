The next year, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> were only eight fossas in the world's zoos, the Duisburg Zoo in Germany acquired one; this zoo later started a successful breeding program, and most zoo fossas now descend from the Duisburg population. Research on the Duisburg fossas has provided much data about their biology.|$|E

In the site's early years, it received {{only a small amount}} of fan-submitted material, which has ballooned since and made constant site maintenance a challenge.

5|$|In {{temperate}} areas, {{the male}} owl moults rather {{later in the}} year than the female, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> is an abundance of food, the female has recommenced hunting and the demands of the chicks are lessening. Unmated males without family responsibilities often start losing feathers earlier in the year. The moult follows a similar prolonged pattern to that of the female and the first sign that the male is moulting is often when a tail feather has been dropped at the roost. A consequence of moulting is the loss of thermal insulation. This is of little importance in the tropics and barn owls here usually moult a complete complement of flight feathers annually. The hot-climate moult may still take place over a long period but is usually concentrated at a particular time of year outside the breeding season.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, the club's home {{moved from}} the Antônio Carlos to the newer and larger Estádio Independência. The season saw another Campeonato Mineiro triumph and the club's first European tour, in which it played ten games in five countries. The {{excursion}} happened <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> were neither regular national competitions in Brazil nor continental ones in South America, and followed soon after the traumatic Maracanazo. The tour and Atlético's results, many of which achieved under adverse weather conditions and snow, were seen by national sports media as a historic achievement for Brazilian football itself. The team, captained by Zé do Monte, was dubbed the Campeões do Gelo ("Ice Champions"), a title that is remembered in the club's official anthem. The club's success in the state competition continued in the 1950s, a decade that saw the rise of forward Ubaldo and five consecutive Campeonato Mineiro victories from 1952 to 1956. After another state league title in 1958, Atlético {{took part in the}} inaugural edition of the Taça Brasil in the following year, reaching the third round. The tournament, the country's first annual nationwide competition, was a cup contested between state league champions, originally created by the CBD to select Brazil's entrants in the newly formed Copa Libertadores.|$|E

25|$|The Oslo Tramway was {{established}} as a horsecar network in 1875 by Kristiania Sporveisselskab (1875). In 1887 it rejected a proposal for L.

They sent an application that year to the municipality, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> were no other electric tramways in operation in Europe.
