This time, Raonic upset Federer in {{straight}} sets, winning his eighth career title. Asked to talk about Raonic after the match, Federer observed: [...] "or <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>guy</b> he moves well ... He's improved his fitness the last few years.

500|$|Garcia {{returned}} to the Indians in 1949. A newspaper article predicted that Garcia might fill big needs in the Cleveland bullpen. Garcia saw action as a starter and as a relief pitcher that year, starting 20 of his 41 regular season appearances. He finished his rookie season with a 14–5 record, a league-leading 2.36 ERA, 94 strikeouts and five shutouts. Fellow pitcher Bob Feller said, [...] "From the beginning, Mike was a sneaky quick pitcher. For <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>guy,</b> he was certainly mobile." [...] One year removed from his rookie season, expectations from Indians General Manager Hank Greenberg and pitching coach Mel Harder were for Garcia to become a key piece of the Indians' rotation. [...] "Garcia has all the potentialities of a really great pitcher. I see no reason he should not reach greatness this season", Greenberg said. Garcia finished the 1950 season 11–11.|$|E

When Quark Industries failed to produce an actual robot with artificial intelligence, the solution was to use a human pilot. As Hunter puts it, the <b>Big</b> <b>Guy</b> {{was nothing more than}} <b>a</b> fancy tank. <b>Big</b> <b>Guy</b> is able to fly, possesses great strength and is armed with a variety of integrated weaponry, including the signature fold-out guns in the elbow housings.

500|$|In 1932, Chuck Kocsis (the first golfer {{inducted}} into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor), enrolled at the university. When a promised alumni pledge to pay his expenses fell through, Trueblood agreed to make a loan (at five percent interest) so Kocsis could pay his tuition. The Wolverines with Kocsis won the NCAA championship twice. Kocsis recalled that the team often traveled to tournaments in Trueblood's car. [...] "Professor Trueblood had a seven-passenger Buick," [...] Kocsis said. [...] "He designated me as the chauffeur. So {{if we had a}} golf match, we'd all get into the car and go to Chicago, or go to Ohio, wherever we were going to play." [...] Another teammate recalled the trips in Trueblood's car: [...] "It wasn't a very big Buick, as I recall. [...] We rode with six guys. Chuck used to do most of the driving. I remember that trip down to Washington (for the 1935 national championship at Congressional, which Michigan won). We started in the morning and drove all the way down there. Professor Trueblood was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>guy,</b> too." [...] Trueblood took the team on a side trip to Mount Vernon, where one of the players accidentally bumped the shifter into gear and hit the accelerator as he exited Trueblood's car. The car lurched forward; the open door hit something and was torn off its hinges.|$|E

2500|$|Carl Streator is {{the protagonist}} of Lullaby. Over {{the course of the}} novel, a few {{important}} aspects of his character are revealed that play a part in his narration style and his character. Firstly, he imparts to us at the beginning of Chapter 2 that he is a journalist. Because the novel is set up as a frame story, the majority of Lullaby is written as a retelling by Streator himself. [...] This is apparent throughout the novel as he describes the people and events around him. He will often recount a person’s appearance in terms of 'the details': [...] "The details of Nash are, he’s <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>guy</b> in a white uniform.

(Society of Automotive Engineers) convention (February, 1964 in Cobo Hall in Detroit, Michigan) and everybody was steamed up about it! But the thing that killed the Tarpon was the fact that we didn't have a V-8 for it at that time.... Roy Abernethy didn't like little cars. Never did. He liked big cars, because he was <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>guy</b> -- hell of a nice guy. And he felt that this car was too small, so he said, [...] "Well, heck, Teague, why don't you just put it on the Rambler Classic wheel-base?

It also includes a baby singing to him some of the chorus, and a pair of lesbian twins in his car's backseat. The car is a Saab 95.

A Camarasaurus (described in the series as Brontosaurus) whom the Porters {{sometimes}} call <b>Big</b> <b>Guy</b> also appears frequently, mostly browsing on the vegetation, either at big lakes or at the Porters' treehouse. He is thought by some fans to be Dopey, the infant Sauropod from the original series, all grown up.

[...] When {{he was ready to}} enter high school, Ichiro was selected by a school with a prestigious baseball program, Nagoya's Aikodai Meiden (...) High School. Ichiro was primarily used as a pitcher instead of as an outfielder, owing to his exceptionally strong arm. His cumulative high school batting average was [...]505, with 19 home runs. He built strength and stamina by hurling car tires and hitting Wiffle balls with a heavy shovel, among other regimens. These exercises helped develop his wrists and hips, adding power and endurance to his thin frame.

Similar sentiments regarding stature, while not aimed at Watson specifically, had been expressed by other rugby pundits. Italy coach and former Springbok coach Nick Mallett has been a supporter of Watson. When asked in 2008 why in his opinion the Springboks won the 2007 World Cup, Mallett told an audience that the reason the Springboks won was because Schalk Burger is the smallest player in the Springboks' forward pack. Schalk Burger is 1,93m tall, while Watson is 1,84m. And in March 2008 SA Rugby Magazine quoted newly appointed Springbok coach Peter de Villiers as saying: “A small talented guy will always be better than <b>a</b> <b>big</b> untalented <b>guy,</b> and <b>a</b> <b>big</b> talented <b>guy</b> {{is better than a}} small talented guy.
