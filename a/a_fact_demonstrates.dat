The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze the beliefs and attitudes of tobacco producers, within the theoretical framework of sustainable development and issues involving the productive relationship between men and nature. The results are built from the perspective of quality of life of human beings, including not only economic and sociocultural aspects as well as environmental (Dias, 2009). Data collection was performed by a qualitative method, combining in-depth interviews and commented survey application. The results point to a discussion about the rural development model in the family farm in southern Brazil. Most of the families visited said that tobacco is planted by the lack of viable alternatives, showing a contradictory relationship with this activity. Analyzing the economic point of view, the cultivation of tobacco is the best option, however, if we consider the perspective of sustainability, there are problems in social and environmental terms, <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by the stories of health difficulties for farmers due to pesticide application...|$|R

Solutions to the {{equations}} of motion of the low-energy, effective field theory emerging out of compactified heterotic string theory are constructed by making use of the well known duality symmetries.

30|$|Surprisingly though, {{business}} owners do not typically show either survival-dominated or development-dominated consumption patterns. Even though we controlled for other variables (e.g. fixed assets of household’s productivity per capita) in the model, why is development-oriented consumption among {{business owners}} so low, <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by the insignificant effect of household income per capita on development-oriented consumption? Given that {{these individuals are}} supposed to be the wealthiest among the population, this seems surprising. The initial assumption was that business owners, who employ others for labour, are at the top of society in terms of income, should be more likely to pursue developmental-oriented consumption and thus show a high level of developmental-oriented MPC. However, the results indicate the opposite. Two possible explanations are as follows: on the one hand, a portion of this their development-oriented consumption is included in the purchase cost of their private businesses or companies, that is, it is common for business owners to buy their household’s electronic appliances, cars, and real estate (which aims to improve their living standard) under the name of their business or company. 19 Similarly, expenditures on overseas travel, education, entertainment, communication, and transportation of the business owners and their family members could also be included in regular business-operating expenses. For some small family businesses, it is common for family expenses to be mixed in with operating expenses. Thus, the insignificance of this MPC does not necessarily indicate a conservative consumption style among this social class.|$|R

The natural world as a fascinating feature of towns and cities has a much longer history (e. g. Fitter 1945), and has also played a strong part in local biological conservation in some countries over the late 20 th Century (Goode 2014 ​).

40|$|A {{surface model}} was {{developed}} for diamondlike-carbon film deposition, and was connected in a self-consistent way with a one-dimensional plasma chemistry and physics model for a CH 4 radio-frequency (rf) discharge. The surface model considers the adsorption of multiple species (CH 3, CH 2, and H), and solves for the surface coverage of each species. Comparison is also done with a one-adsorbed-species model. Deposition is assumed to take place via direct ion incorporation, and ion-induced stitching of adsorbed neutrals; film removal takes place via etching and sputtering. The effects of ion flux/energy and surface temperature are examined in detail: At high ion energies direct ion incorporation dominates, in spite of competition with sputtering; at intermediate energies stitching prevails, while for lower ion energies etching can become largest. Mass balances are written at the surface - gas interface, permitting {{the determination of the}} effective sticking coefficients of the reacting neutrals. The sticking coefficients calculated from the surface model are fed back into the gas-phase chemistry model to recalculate the neutral densities. The process is repeated until a self-consistent solution is obtained. It is shown that the effective sticking coefficient of a neutral changes drastically from a low value for the plasma-off (or low ion energy) state, to a high value for the plasma-on and high ion energy state, resulting in higher consumption at the surface. The results show that it is imperative for meaningful results to solve surface and gas-phase chemistry models in a self-consistent way, <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by successful comparison with experimental data for the deposition rate and the gas-phase densities. © 1996 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

Such scaling behavior would result from the intermolecular potential having the form of an inverse power law (IPL), suggesting that an IPL is a good approximation for certain relaxation properties over the relevant range of intermolecular distances. However, the derivation of the scaling property of an IPL liquid is based on reduced quantities, for example, the reduced relaxation time equal to T^ 1 / 2 V^- 1 / 3 times the actual relaxation time. The difference between scaling using reduced rather than unreduced units is negligible in the supercooled regime; however, at higher temperature the difference can be substantial, accounting for the purported breakdown of the scaling and giving rise to different values of the scaling exponent.

In some cases, the extent of dietary overlap can {{be as high as}} 68.8%. Lions typically ignore spotted hyenas, unless they are on a kill or are being harassed by them. There exists a common misconception that hyenas steal kills from lions, but most often it is the other way around. Lions will readily steal the kills of spotted hyenas; in the Ngorongoro Crater, it is common for lions to subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas. Lions are quick to follow the calls of hyenas feeding, <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> <b>demonstrated</b> by field experiments, during which lions repeatedly approached whenever the tape-recorded calls of hyenas feeding were played. When confronted on a kill by lions, spotted hyenas will either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30–100 metres until the lions have finished eating. In some cases, spotted hyenas are bold enough to feed alongside lions, and may occasionally force lions off a kill. This mostly occurs during the nighttime, when hyenas are bolder. Spotted hyenas usually prevail against groups of lionesses unaccompanied by males if they outnumber them 4:1. In some instances they were seen to have taken on and routed two pride males while outnumbering them 5:1. The two species may act aggressively toward one another even when there is no food at stake. Lions may charge at hyenas and maul them for no apparent reason; one male lion was filmed killing two hyenas on separate occasions without eating them, and lion predation can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in Etosha. Spotted hyenas have adapted to this pressure by frequently mobbing lions which enter their territories. Experiments on captive spotted hyenas revealed that specimens with no prior experience with lions act indifferently to the sight of them, but will react fearfully to the scent.|$|R

The second utopia lies in the idea of universality of the regime, in establishing that human rights are recognized for all persons without exception, regardless of their nationality, citizenship or migratory condition. Finally, the third utopia is identified with the State’s activity of incorporating an ample catalogue of human rights within its laws, including at the constitutional level, {{while at the same time}} enacting restrictive and discriminatory legislation, with the understanding that it is thus possible to discourage, restrict, or transform mass phenomena such as migration, the causes of which are highly varied and extralegal in character, <b>a</b> <b>fact</b> that <b>demonstrates</b> the paradox of conceiving of human beings as being fixed in nature...|$|R

Even if some Chinese Catholics were considered to have accepted as their belief the correctness of the approval of abortion and artificial contraception that {{has been attributed to}} the CPCA, their position could be compared with that of certain Catholics in other countries who expressly adopt that approval as their personal belief. In, for instance, inviting bishops appointed under CPCA rules to attend as Catholics in full communion with Rome an assembly of the Synod of Bishops, the Holy See indicated that it does not consider that the Church in mainland China (as distinct from the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association) approves of abortion and artificial contraception. [...] "The Holy See has continued to consider the episcopal ordinations in China fully valid." [...] The clergy whom they ordain therefore conserve valid Holy Orders, and the other sacraments that require a priest as minister (in particular the Eucharist) are also considered valid. <b>As</b> these <b>facts</b> <b>demonstrate,</b> the CPCA and the [...] "underground" [...] Catholic Church in China have significant overlap.|$|R
