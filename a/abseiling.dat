5|$|The Mendips {{are home}} {{to a wide range}} of outdoor sports and leisure activities, {{including}} hunting, caving, climbing, and <b>abseiling.</b> The rich variety of fauna and flora also makes it attractive for hillwalking and those interested in natural history.|$|E
5|$|The {{association}} {{also began}} to change in its focus, with a renewed emphasis on outdoor adventure and it now offers over 200 fun and adventurous activities for Scouts, from <b>abseiling</b> and archery while also offering {{a wider range of}} development opportunities, from coding to music and drama. In 2004 the association appointed television presenter Peter Duncan as its Chief Scout, who was succeeded by adventurer Bear Grylls in July 2009. The first UK Chief Commissioner, Wayne Bulpitt was appointed on the same day, with a particular remit to support volunteers, grow and develop the association.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, Mark {{returns to}} Erinsborough. He tells Kate that Holland has died, {{so he was}} able to leave witness protection. Mark {{explains}} that his death had to be faked after Holland put out a hit on him. After learning that Kate had been asking about him, he believed that she wanted to see him again. Mark explains that he has been living in the Blue Mountains and working as an <b>abseiling</b> instructor. Mark and Kate spend time together, which makes her boyfriend, Mason, jealous. Mark also catches up with Lucas and Kyle. He tries to persuade Kate that her future is with him and they kiss. But when Mason learns Mark has a girlfriend in Sydney, he tells Kate, resulting in a fight between himself and Mark. Mark tells Kate {{that he was going to}} propose to his girlfriend, but wanted to see where things stood between them first. Kate chooses Mason and Mark leaves. Months later, Mason runs into Mark in Lysterfield, where he asks for his help as Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) has been injured <b>abseiling.</b> Mark accompanies the group to the hospital, where he runs into Kate. Mark decides to stay in Erinsborough and is offered a job at Fitzgerald Motors by Danni Ferguson (Laura McIntosh). He also moves into Number 24.|$|E
50|$|The South African <b>Abseil</b> or South African Double Roped Classical <b>Abseil</b> is {{a modern}} {{variation}} of the non-mechanical classical <b>abseil</b> method used by mountaineers and rock climbers to quickly descend steep terrain by sliding down a rope wrapped around their body to create controlled friction.|$|R

5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Portia have hunting tactics as {{versatile}} and adaptable as a lion's. All members of Portia have instinctive tactics for their most common prey, but can improvise {{by trial and error}} against unfamiliar prey or in unfamiliar situations, and then remember the new approach. They can also make detours to find the best attack angle against dangerous prey, even when the best detour takes a Portia out of visual contact with the prey, and sometimes the planned route leads to <b>abseiling</b> down a silk thread and biting the prey from behind. Such detours may take up to an hour, and a Portia usually picks the best route even if it needs to walk past an incorrect route. If a Portia makes a mistake while hunting another spider, it may itself be killed.|$|E
5|$|The two SAS teams on-scene, Red Team and Blue Team, {{were ordered}} to begin their {{simultaneous}} assaults, under the codename Operation Nimrod, at 19:23. One group of four men from Red Team abseiled from the roof down {{the rear of the}} building, while another four-man team lowered a stun grenade through the skylight. The detonation of the stun grenade was supposed to coincide with the <b>abseiling</b> teams detonating explosives to gain entry to the building through the second-floor windows. Their descent had not gone according to plan and the staff sergeant leading the abseilers became entangled in his rope. While trying to assist him, one of the other soldiers had accidentally smashed a window with his foot. The noise of the breaking window alerted Oan, who was on the first floor communicating with the police negotiators, and he went to investigate. The soldiers were unable to use explosives for fear of injuring their stranded staff sergeant, but managed to smash their way into the embassy.|$|E

25|$|The {{origin of}} the <b>abseil</b> is {{attributed}} to Jean Charlet-Straton, a Chamonix guide who lived from 1840–1925. Charlet originally devised the technique of the <b>abseil</b> method of roping down during a failed solo attempt of Petit Dru in 1876. After many attempts, some of them solo, he managed to reach {{the summit of the}} Petit Dru in 1879 in the company of two other Chamonix guides, Prosper Payot and Frédéric Folliguet, whom he hired. During that ascent, Charlet perfected the <b>abseil.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2009, {{more than}} 150 {{members of the}} Derby Mountain Rescue Team <b>abseiled</b> down the tower for charity.

50|$|Beat the Mole: The {{eight players}} {{were faced with}} a 16-storeyhigh silo which they were to <b>abseil,</b> facing down. Whether the players chose to do the task or not was {{completely}} their choice, {{but there was a}} twist: the actual assignment was for the Mole to bet on whether they would actually <b>abseil</b> or not. Each player was extracted from the group separately by Shura, and each were asked questions of varying topics ranging from the fashion trends of the players to the Australian economy, whilst the Mole (whose identity still remained a secret) was given a secret assignment to bet on whether the genuine players, including the Mole himself or herself, would <b>abseil</b> down the silo or not. If he or she incorrectly predicted whether the players would <b>abseil</b> down the silo, the team would win $2,000 towards the pot, however, if he or she correctly predicted that they would do the challenge, then $2,000 would be lost from the pot. Hillal was the only player to even <b>abseil</b> down the silo, whilst the other seven refused to attempt the task, with Nick, Aisha and Kerrie refusing to even climb up the silo. Seven of the eight predictions were correct, with only Sam refusing to <b>abseil</b> when it was thought that he would, therefore losing $12,000 from the pot.|$|R
25|$|<b>Abseiling</b> can be dangerous, and {{presents}} risks, especially to unsupervised or inexperienced abseilers. According to German mountaineer Pit Schubert, about 25% of climbing deaths occur during <b>abseiling,</b> most commonly due to failing anchors. Another frequent cause of accidents is <b>abseiling</b> beyond {{the end of}} the rope. Backing up the rope set-up with a friction knot (autoblock, Kleimheist, or prusik) such that the slipping of the rope is stopped even if the climber lets go of the control rope provides a measure of safety with regard to the control of the rate of descent.|$|E

25|$|Ropes: Climbers often simply {{use their}} {{climbing}} ropes for <b>abseiling.</b> For many other applications, low-stretch rope (typically ~2% stretch when under the load {{of a typical}} bodyweight) called static rope is used to reduce bouncing and to allow easier ascending of the rope.|$|E
