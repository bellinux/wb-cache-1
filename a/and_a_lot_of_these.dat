40|$|Abstract. The novel {{connection}} between Raynaud disease and fish oils was uncovered from two disjointed biomedical literature sets by Swanson in 1986. Since then, {{there have been}} many approaches to uncover novel connections by mining the biomedical literature. One of the popular approaches is to adapt the Association Rule (AR) method to automatically identify implicit novel connections between concept A and concept C from two disjointed sets of documents through intermediate B concept. Since A and C concepts do not occur together in the same data set, the mining goal is to find novel connection among A and C concepts in the disjoint data sets. It first applies association rule to the two disjointed biomedical literature sets separately to generate two rule sets (A�B, B�C), and then applies transitive law to get the novel connections A�C. However, this approach generates a huge number of possible connections among the millions of biomedical concepts <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> hypothetical connections are spurious, useless and/or biologically meaningless. Thus it is essential to develop new approach to generate highly likely novel and biologically relevant connections among the biomedical concepts. This paper presents a Biomedical Semantic-based Association Rule System (Bio-SARS) that significantly reduce spurious/useless/biologically irrelevant connections through semantic filtering. Compared to other approaches such as LSI and traditional association rule-based approach, our approach generates much fewer rules <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> rules represent relevant connections among biological concepts. ...|$|E

This study explored methods of improving concrete practices so as to obtain better qualities structures. The research replicated some of the common concrete practices adopted by the construction industry in Nigeria to obtain the compressive strength of normal concrete. Two types of Portland cement brand, Type A and Type and three aggregate sizes (12. 5 mm, 19 mm and 30 mm) together with a mixed-size aggregate were utilized for the research. The concrete produced were tested for compressive strength and compared with test results from sites in Lagos Nigeria. The results showed how cement brands and aggregate sizes influence the compressive strength of normal concrete. The results also proved that the common poor quality concrete verified in Nigeria are not properly prepared...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This study explores {{how well}} {{teachers}} think they succeed in their mission to include {{children with special}} needs into their ordinary groups of children. Interviews were carried out with five teachers in practice of the public school (year 2, 3, 5 and 6). The teachers were asked what support they have got from the schools manager, initially and ongoing, (information, necessary education, supportive expertise personnel, assistant teacher to the child and schoolmaterial.) The teachers were also asked how inclusion is arranged by three indicators of participation: physically, socially (interaction) and didactically -in educational situations of reading and writing. One finding of the study was that inclusion is difficult to arrange if  parents of included children demand secrecy of the diagnosis their child has. Three cases reveal severe problems of acceptance for the included child by the peers. In the other two cases the groups show great understanding and allowance. Furthermore, in the first mentioned groups the child was forced to be physically excluded from the peers and the group. All teachers were questioning if an included school form is the best for the child. There are few signs of progress due to inclusion <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> children’s problems depend on low cognitive ability. Peers don´t have much response from their included friends.   All teachers lack time, education and support for their mission to include a dysfunctional pupil.

40|$|Abstract: The {{patenting}} of the Friction Stir Welding (FSW) {{process in}} 1991 {{opened up a}} process that was known within a relatively small circle of researchers to the entire research community. As a ground-breaking process {{in the field of}} joining, FSW offered a chance for the types of joining that had been fraught with lots of difficulties using the prevalent traditional means of joining. Dissimilar metal joining had been plagued with more challenges compared to similar metal joining due to issues related to differences in thermal expansion and conductivity, wettability, melting properties, microstructural properties and other material properties. Fusion welding of some dissimilar materials such as Aluminium and titanium; Aluminium and Steel had been nearly impossible; the few welds that were successful resulted in defects (like wormhole, lack of penetration, porosity, cracks) and welding imperfections. Hence, the advent of FSW, a solid state welding technique, provided {{a way out of the}} many difficulties that arise in the joining of dissimilar metals. Aluminium and copper are also two of such dissimilar metals whose material properties make them useful for a wide range of applications. However, due to the wide differences in their material properties, both metals had been difficult to join using the fusion welding technology. Recently, lots of successes have been achieved in the joining of both dissimilar metals using FSW <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> are recorded in the open literature. Nonetheless, most of the successes recorded in the FSW of aluminium and copper have been in the butt weld configuration.

Digital distribution giant Steam releases on average 10 new games every day <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> games go by unnoticed and unbought. Consumers must often make compromises when {{deciding what to}} buy. Mistakes are often made and impulse buying can often take hold. To solve this problem, IronSight aims to not only help put the massive amounts of releases of games into a consumer’s perspective but also to help the consumer decide on what’s best for them. The app will list all major and minor releases to the user, allowing the user to search and filter {{what they want to}} buy. These titles can then be added to a personal list where updates and notifications will be sent to the user. Through this personal list of titles, a suggested list will be generated with other games related to what the user is interested in. The data from other users may also add to this suggested list. The main list is supported by an online database where all titles will be stored. The personal users list is stored on a local database on the device which will be managed by Firebase. Suggested titles are generated by randomising the titles in the main list and generating a separate list of diverse titles based on genre. This is to encourage the user to broaden their horizons with regard to games they may not have previously considered. Notifications of game releases are sent to the user by using the Firebase console to schedule notifications to users about the release of games. Meet ups are also supported as a feature that enables users to contact other users with the intent of joining them in playing any game that has been added to their own personal list.
