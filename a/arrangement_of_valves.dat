25|$|The engine {{has much}} in common with modern ones. It has two cylinders, a carburetor, a {{familiar}} <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>valves</b> and cams. However, unlike modern engines, and unlike the earlier 1807 François Isaac de Rivaz engine, the explosion did not directly provide power. Instead, the explosion expelled air from the cylinder through a one-way valve. The cylinder was cooled by a water jacket and water injected into the combustion chamber after it fired. The cooling gasses caused a vacuum and atmospheric pressure drove the piston. Morey did mention trying direct action, and elaborated on it in other descriptions. However, his method was more complicated and possibly less efficient because it used more of the engine’s stroke to draw in fuel.|$|E
6000|$|When he left Julia Brabazon in the garden, Harry Clavering {{did not go}} at once home to the rectory, but sauntered out {{all alone}} into the park, {{intending}} to indulge in reminiscences of his past romance. It was all over, that idea of having Julia Brabazon for his love; and now he had to ask himself whether he intended to be made permanently miserable by her wordly falseness, or whether he would borrow something of her wordly wisdom, and agree with himself {{to look back on}} what was past as a pleasurable excitement in his boyhood. Of course we all know that really permanent misery was in truth out of the question. Nature had not made him physically or mentally so poor a creature as to be incapable of a cure. But on this occasion he decided on permanent misery. There was about his heart--about his actual anatomical heart, with its internal <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> <b>valves</b> and blood-vessels--a heavy dragging feeling that almost amounted to corporeal pain, and which he described to himself as agony. Why should this rich, debauched, disreputable lord have the power of taking the cup from his lip, the one morsel of bread which he coveted from his mouth, his one ingot of treasure out of his coffer? Fight him! No, he knew he could not fight Lord Ongar. The world was against such an arrangement. And in truth Harry Clavering had so much contempt for Lord Ongar, that he had no wish to fight so poor a creature. The man had had delirium tremens, and was a worn-out miserable object. So at least Harry Clavering was only too ready to believe. He did not care much for Lord Ongar in the matter. His anger was against her; that she should have deserted him for a miserable creature, who had nothing to back him but wealth and rank! ...|$|E

50|$|The {{class were}} {{fitted with a}} steam chest and slide valves located beneath the cylinders. The valves were driven by Stephenson valve gear. This {{inverted}} <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> slide <b>valves</b> and steam chest, originally introduced by William Stroudley of the LSBCR, allowed the valves to drop away from the cylinder's steam port faces when the regulator was closed, thus reducing wear. Because the steam chest was below the cylinders, and not between them, the latter could have an increased diameter. The centre line of the cylinders was inclined at an angle of 6° to the centre line <b>of</b> the <b>valves,</b> each centre line being aligned with the driving centre. This arrangement allowed the valve rods to be driven directly from the expansion link. First used on the Armstrong and 3031 Classes, this <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> cylinders, <b>valves</b> and valve gear was subsequently used on all GWR outside framed 4-4-0s, with the slide valves being eventually replaced by piston valves.|$|R

5000|$|In a fixed matrix regenerator, {{a single}} fluid stream has cyclical, {{reversible}} flow; {{it is said}} to flow [...] "counter-current". This regenerator may be part of a valveless system, such as a Stirling engine. In another configuration, the fluid is ducted through valves to different matrices in alternate operating periods resulting in outlet temperatures that vary with time. For example a blast furnace may have several [...] "stoves" [...] or [...] "checkers" [...] full of refractory fire brick. The hot gas from the furnace is ducted through the brickwork for some interval, say one hour, until the brick reaches a high temperature.

50|$|By early 1922 {{management}} decided {{things could}} not be left alone and in April of that year No.s 957 and 958 were rebuilt to the strange <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> Walschaerts <b>valve</b> gears for the outside cylinders and Stephenson link motion for the inside one.

50|$|From early 1947, engines {{were built}} {{with the top}} feed on the front ring of the boiler (from no. 4998), and Nos 44658-767 had a longer {{wheelbase}} (27 ft 6in rather than 27 ft 2in, with {{the change in the}} coupled wheelbase from 7 ft + 8 ft to 7 ft + 8 ft 3in); this was necessary in order to accommodate the Timken roller-bearing housings without fouling the ashpan. In 1948, George Ivatt introduced more modifications to bearings and valve gear; other experimental Ivatt features included the use of steel rather than copper fireboxes on certain engines, and the fitting of double blastpipes & chimneys in some instances. 44738-57 were built with Caprotti valve gear.

40|$|In {{the article}} the authors present {{advanced}} constructions of prestressed reinforced concrete flat ceiling, where high-strength ropes in elastic shell {{are used as}} stressed reinforcement. The novelty of the solution lays in diagonal <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> hard <b>valves</b> and use <b>of</b> high-strength ropes in a flexible shell of "Monostrand" type. This type of prestress, in our opinion, is the most acceptable from technical point of view for selective reinforcement of separate tense rods or cables.

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{mortality}} following {{repair of}} atrioventricular septal defects has fallen {{dramatically in the}} last 4 decades, but reoperation for late regurgitation across the left atrioventricular valve has remained disconcertingly stagnant. Seeking potential structural causes, we compared the morphology of the surgically created septal leaflet <b>of</b> the left <b>valve</b> following repair <b>of</b> atrioventricular septal defects to the aortic leaflet of the normal mitral valve. MethodsWe compared the mitral <b>valves</b> <b>of</b> 92 normal hearts to the left ventricular components of the bridging leaflets of hearts with atrioventricular septal defect with common atrioventricular junction, determining {{the shape of the}} leaflets and the <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> the subvalvar apparatus. ResultsThe aortic leaflet <b>of</b> the mitral <b>valve</b> is triangular compared with its rectangular septal counterpart after repair of atrioventricular septal defect. The cordal arrangement in the mitral valve is well organized, compared with the deficient cordal <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> the abnormal <b>valve.</b> A greater proportion of cords in the mitral valve divide to 3 generations (55. 5 % compared with 8. 7 %; P <. 001), and a higher percentage of cords remain undivided in atrioventricular septal defects (60. 8 % compared with 25 %; P <. 001). ConclusionsNot only is the annular component in the left atrioventricular valve abnormal, but the subvalvar apparatus is characterized by deficiency and disarray. Furthermore, the axis of cordal insertion may potentiate to separation over the long term of the leaflets joined surgically.

Morphological changes which are happed within <b>valves</b> <b>of</b> the heart at time of cardiac diseases the modern medicine considers on the clinical, instrumental, histological, cytological and ultramicroscopical levels. The cardiac surgeons that make the heart valve replacement using the tissue engineering have the great interest in front <b>of</b> the heart <b>valves.</b> The achievements <b>of</b> the modern medicine are impossible without the fundamental morphological investigations. Objective. To study the morphological features of the cusps <b>of</b> human heart <b>valves</b> on the light and ultramicroscopic levels. Methods. We have reviewed the structure of cusps <b>of</b> 48 heart <b>valves</b> <b>of</b> adults. It was used a light and electron microscopy which enabled us to study the morphology of cusps of atria-ventricular and ventriculo-vascular heart valves. Results. The data indicate that cusps <b>of</b> heart <b>valves</b> are stratified. Layers of cusps are made {{of different types of}} fibrous connective tissues. The spongy layer is made of loose connective tissue, the fibrous layer – dense regular connective tissue, ventricular layer – dense irregular connective tissue. The <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> these layers in the cusps <b>of</b> atria-ventricular heart <b>valves</b> (in the direction from atrium toward ventricle) is: spongy, fibrous and ventricular. The <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> these layers in the cusps <b>of</b> ventricular-vascular heart <b>valves</b> (in the direction from side that is faced to the wall of blood vessel toward the ventricle) is: fibrous, spongy, ventricular. Conclusion. The position of data layers within cusp <b>of</b> atria-ventricular <b>valves</b> differs from position of data layers within ventriculo-vascular <b>valves.</b> These changes <b>of</b> tissue localization correlate to haemodynamic conditions during heart cycle.

40|$|AbstractThe {{important}} role of the cytoskeleton in the morphogenesis of siliceous frustule components, which are synthesized within the diatom cells, has been revealed due to experiments with microtubule inhibitors. It {{has been shown that}} colchicine entering the diatom cell inhibits polymerization of tubulin, the main protein of microtubules, thereby disrupting the normal processes of biogenic silica deposition and daughter valve morphogenesis. In this study, experiments with a synchronized culture of the pennate diatom Synedra acus have been performed to determine the timing and duration of the formation <b>of</b> various <b>valve</b> components and analyze the effect of colchicine at a subtoxic concentration on the structure <b>of</b> daughter <b>valves</b> at different stages of their morphogenesis. Electron microscopic analysis has revealed several types of micro- and nanoscale anomalies in daughter valve morphology, with their frequency varying depending on the time of colchicine treatment. Laser scanning microscopy of preparations vitally stained with Tubulin Tracker Green has shown that polymerized tubulin at early stages <b>of</b> <b>valve</b> morphogenesis is localized along the periphery <b>of</b> the developing <b>valve.</b> This is evidence for an {{important role}} of microtubules in the horizontal growth <b>of</b> the <b>valve</b> at the stage when its general structural pattern is established, including its shape and <b>arrangement</b> <b>of</b> basic micro- and nanostructures.
