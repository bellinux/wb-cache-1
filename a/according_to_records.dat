5|$|The Steynings {{family owned}} Holnicote until the direct male line became extinct {{with the death}} of Charles Staynings (1622–1700). His wife, Susanna (died 1685), was a {{daughter}} of Sir Nicholas Martyn of Oxton and Steynings's heir was their nephew, William Martyn. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>records</b> of the Heralds' Visitations of Devon and research by the Victorian historian J. L. Vivian, this William Martyn lived in Oxton in the parish of Kenton, Devon; he was Susanna Martyn's great-nephew and died in 1710, aged 30. He sold the estate to William Blackford, a Master in Chancery. Blackford then bought the manors of Bossington and Avill, the latter from Anthony Stocker and his wife, Sarah; this estate extended from the ridge of Grabbist nearly to the sea-shore and also included land in the parishes of Dunster, Carhampton, Crowcombe, Stogumber, Timberscombe and St. Decumans. He married Elizabeth, a daughter of John Dyke of Pixton, and died in 1728. His son, William, succeeded him and married Henrietta Collet (died 1727), a daughter and co-heiress of Joseph Collet of Hertford Castle in Hertfordshire. However, he died only three years after his father. Their only daughter and heiress, Henrietta Blackford, inherited the estate as an infant, but died aged 7 in 1733. The estates were divisible upon a great-aunt, Elizabeth Dyke (died 1737), and a second cousin, Elizabeth, a daughter of Thomas Dyke of Tetton and Mary, a daughter of Elizabeth Dyke (died 1737). Later in 1733, Elizabeth Dyke (died 1737) conveyed her share in the estate to her only surviving son, Edward Dyke (died 1746) who in turn conveyed his portion to his niece in 1744, making her the sole owner of the entire estate.|$|E

Unlike previous buildings built on the site, the museum had to replicate rather than relocate this one {{due to the fact}} that fewer buildings are being demolished compared to the 1970s, and in any case it was deemed unlikely one could be found to fit the curved shape of the plot. The studio is named after a real business run by John Reed Edis and his daughter Daisy. Mr Edis, originally at 27 Sherburn Road, Durham, in 1895, then 52 Saddler Street from 1897.

The government introduced two such bills; the second, sent down from the House of Lords on 5 April 1593, was protested down by Fuller as [...] "dangerous to good subjects", because it made [...] "schisms to be equal with seditions and treasons, which is against the equity of the former law". <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>records,</b> [...] "upon a motion of Mr Fuller’s, the whole committee assented to the striking out of the title and the whole preamble.

However, the IUCN Red List notes that while sightings of the false potto at 820 to 940m (2690 to 3080ft) on Mount Kupe had been reported, surveys had failed to confirm its occurrence there, though pottos, some with long tails, had been found. The false potto is not listed separately from the potto in the Red List, because the evidence that it is a distinct species is considered insufficient.|$|E

500|$|In August 2007, an {{investigation}} by The Wall Street Journal revealed potential campaign finance irregularities involving Hsu, {{in his role as}} a [...] "bundler", and his long-time associates, the Paw family of Daly City, California.

These donations closely coordinated with those of Hsu in terms of timing, amounts and donees. In addition, the donations appeared to be much larger than would be expected given the Paw's modest income. <b>According</b> <b>to</b> <b>records</b> obtained for the investigation, the Paws own a gift shop and live in a [...] house that they recently refinanced for $270,000.
