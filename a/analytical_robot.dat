40|$|Abstract—The {{control of}} tendon-driven robots using tech-niques from {{traditional}} robotics remains a very challenging task {{that has been}} so far only successfully achieved for small-scale setups comprising exclusively revolute joints [1, 2]. Hence, we propose a fundamentally different approach. Instead of deriving an <b>analytical</b> <b>robot</b> model using either the Newton-Euler or Lagrangian formulation we suggest to employ physics-based simulation engines to simulate the peculiar dynamics of this emerging class of robots {{and to use the}} simulated robot model as an internal model for robot control [3]. In this paper, we present the reverse-engineered derivation of a detailed physics-based model of an anthropomimetic robot implemented on CALIPER [4], a simulation framework developed within the EU-funded project ECCEROBOT [5]. The model com-prises an accurate model of the skeleton derived from laser scan data, as well as of artificial ligaments and muscles. The individual sub-models are validated separately against measurements and the successful integration of all sub-models is demonstrated by executing a limb movement which requires the parallel control of multiple muscles.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Analytical</b> {{models for}} <b>robot</b> {{dynamics}} often per-form suboptimally in practice, due to various non-linearities {{and the difficulty}} of accurately estimating the dynamic pa-rameters. Machine learning techniques are less sensitive to these problems and therefore an interesting alternative for modeling robot dynamics. We propose a learning method that combines a least squares algorithm with a non-linear feature mapping and an efficient update rule. Using data from five different robots, we show that the method can accurately model manipulator dynamics, either when trained in batch or incrementally. Furthermore, the update time and memory usage of the method are bounded, therefore allowing use in real-time control loops. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A {{globally}} convergent {{visual feedback}} control scheme is proposed for dynamical planar robot arms subject to uncertain camera, <b>robot,</b> <b>analytical</b> Jacobian and dynamic friction parameters. When complex friction arises, visual servoing suffers {{to drive the}} robot to the desired trajectories, in particular in slow motion and velocity reversals, which are typical motion regime in visual servoing due to the vision system properties. Moreover, dynamic friction is usually neglected in motion control {{and it is not}} the exception in visual servoing literature. In order to prove the theory described in this paper, the real-time OS, Linux-RTAI, is used to obtain experimental results of this controller on a direct-drive robot manipulator. Results suggest its excelent performance...|$|R
40|$|Robot frame {{compliance}} {{has a large}} {{negative effect}} on the global accuracy of the system when large external forces/torques are exerted. This phenomenon is particularly problematic in applications where the robot is required to achieve ultrahigh (micron level) accuracy under very large external loads, e. g., in biomechanical testing and high precision machining. To ensure the positioning accuracy of the robot in these applications, the authors proposed a novel Stewart platform-based manipulator with decoupled sensor–actuator locations. The unique mechanism has the sensor locations fully decoupled from the actuator locations for the purpose of passively compensating for the load frame compliance, as a result improving the effective stiffness of the manipulator in six degrees of freedom (6 DOF). In this paper, the stiffness of the proposed manipulator is quantified via a simplified method, which combines both an <b>analytical</b> model (<b>robot</b> kinematics error model) and a numerical model [finite element analysis (FEA) model] in the analysis. This method can be used to design systems with specific stiffness requirements. In the control aspect, the noncollocated positions of the sensors and actuators lead to a suboptimal control structure, which is addressed in the paper using a simple Jacobian-based decoupling method under both kinematics- and dynamics-based control. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed manipulator configuration has an effective stiffness that is increased by a factor of greater than 15 compared to a general design. Experimental results show that the Jacobian-based decoupling method effectively increases the dynamic tracking performance of the manipulator by 25 % on average over a conventional method.
