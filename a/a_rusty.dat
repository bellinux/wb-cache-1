5|$|The {{hero and}} heroine split {{up to find}} the Mana Sword. After the hero passes trials to prove himself worthy of the sword, which first appears as <b>a</b> <b>rusty</b> blade, the two join forces to storm the Mana Tree and defeat Julius.

The heroine agrees, and the two protagonists part ways.|$|E
5|$|The sexes {{are similar}} {{although}} the female has, on average, a greyer head. Young birds resembles the non-breeding adult, but are browner and more streaked above with prominent streaking on the underparts. A. s. coutellii {{is smaller than}} the nominate subspecies and {{the white of the}} outer tail feathers has a hint of grey. It is paler and more heavily streaked above, and in summer plumage the underparts' colour covers a larger area and has <b>a</b> <b>rusty</b> tint. A. s. blakistoni is large, pale and less strongly streaked.|$|E
5|$|Before {{what was}} the second largest crowd to witness a game at the Glass Bowl, Toledo {{defeated}} the Bowling Green Falcons 19–13 to win the Peace Pipe. After <b>a</b> <b>Rusty</b> Hanna field goal gave the Rockets an early 3–0 lead, a pair of Erik White touchdown passes gave the Falcons a 13–3 halftime lead. However, the Toledo defense shutout the Bowling Green offense in the second half, and the Rockets came back to win 19–13. Points were scored in the third on a seven-yard touchdown run by Kevin Meger and a one-yard Troy Parker touchdown run. Hanna added a field goal in the fourth. The victory improved Toledo's all-time record against Bowling Green to 22–29–4.|$|E

5|$|Formerly {{a member}} of Hygrophoropsis, Aphroditeola olida is also similar in {{appearance}} to H.aurantiaca but can be distinguished from the false chanterelle by its smaller, pinkish fruit bodies and candy-like odour. It also has smaller spores. Chrysomphalina chrysophylla has a yellowish brown cap and unforked yellow gills. Cortinarius hesleri, an eastern North American species that associates with oaks, has <b>a</b> <b>rusty</b> brown spore print and a cortina in young specimens. The poisonous jack-o'-lantern mushrooms (genus Omphalotus) comprise another group of lookalikes; however, they have straight, non-forked true gills. The European wood-rotting species Haasiella splendidissima, sometimes confused with H.aurantiaca, is most readily distinguished from the latter by its pink spore print and gills that do not fork.|$|E

Several days after the knife was given to Fred Murray, the man's brother allegedly scrapped his Volvo. Family members of the man who turned in the knife claimed he had made up the story in order to obtain reward money in the investigation, and that he had a history of drug use.|$|E
5|$|The adult's plumage is white, {{with black}} flight {{feathers}} in the wings. Wild birds usually appear soiled with <b>a</b> <b>rusty</b> or brown shade {{to the white}} plumage, derived from mud or iron-rich soil. Captive specimens without access to soil have clean white plumage. It has been suggested as a case of cosmetic colouration. The bill is slender and long, and {{the tip of the}} upper mandible is hooked. The nostril is an elongated horizontal slit. The neck feathers are long and form a hackle. The wings are pointed, with the third primary being the longest; the tail is wedge shaped. The legs are pink in adults and grey in juveniles. The claws are long and straight, and the third and fourth toes are slightly webbed at the base.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins as}} three {{boys from the}} small Potos village disobey their Elder's {{instructions}} and trespass into a local waterfall, where a treasure {{is said to be}} kept. One of the boys stumbles and falls into the lake, where he finds <b>a</b> <b>rusty</b> sword embedded in a stone. Guided by a disembodied voice, he pulls the sword free, inadvertently unleashing monsters in the surrounding countryside of the village. The villagers interpret the sword's removal as a bad omen and banish the boy from Potos forever. A traveling knight named Jema recognizes the blade as the legendary Mana Sword and encourages the hero to re-energize it by visiting the eight Mana Temples.|$|E
5|$|Variety subreticulatus, like variety boralis, has a {{generally}} darker coloration than the two-colored bolete, but varies {{much more than}} either. When fresh the coloration of the cap varies from a rose red, red, rose pink, dark red, and purple red. With age it changes to a cinnamon red or <b>a</b> <b>rusty</b> rose color, with yellowing toward the margin. The pore surface {{is similar to that}} of the main speciesyellow when fresh and with age changing to a dull ochre yellow; the bruising coloration is blue but is much lighter and sometimes not appearing to stain when bruised at all. The spore print is olive brown. The distribution of variety subreticulatus is very similar to the distribution of the two-colored bolete in North America, and appears north to eastern Canada and south to Florida, and west to Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|Realizing he is {{powerless}} to defeat Julius, the Hero learns from Cibba about a powerful sword called Excalibur. Cibba helps him find the Excalibur {{only to find}} <b>a</b> <b>rusty</b> Sword instead. He explains that the rusty sword is the Excalibur and would reveal its true strength to whoever it finds worthy. The Hero then raises Dime Tower to reach the Mana Sanctuary and meets a robot known as Marcie. After reaching the top, the tower begins to collapse and Marcie sacrifices himself by throwing the Hero across. After obtaining and passing the sword's trials, the Hero confronts and defeats Julius {{at the cost of}} the Mana Tree's life. The Heroine's mother reveals she is the current Mana Tree and before dying, asks the Heroine to succeed her position. The Heroine agrees and bids farewell to the Hero as she becomes the next Mana Tree and the Hero her guardian.|$|E

Though the Padres would pull back even at 3–3, chasing Dan Petry in the fourth inning in the process, the Tigers retook the lead on <b>a</b> <b>Rusty</b> Kuntz sacrifice fly (actually a pop-out to retreating second baseman Alan Wiggins that the speedy Gibson was able to score on), and doubled it on a solo homer by Parrish.|$|E

The {{highlight of the}} match for England was the first ever test wicket for debutant Angus Fraser who finally captured the wicket of Steve Waugh (undismissed {{in the first two}} tests) giving him a series average of 393.00. The rain ruined Australia's party and a dour Edgbaston test ended in an inevitable draw.|$|E

25|$|The Bills intercepted Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino twice, {{recovered}} three fumbles, forced four sacks, {{and held}} Miami to just 33 rushing yards.

Thurman Thomas, who had been knocked out of the game in both of the Bills prior two playoff contests, rushed for 96 yards and caught five passes for 70, while Kenneth Davis added 61 rushing yards and four receptions for 52.|$|E
25|$|The disease, {{which affects}} about 1/30,000 infants of both genders, may become {{clinically}} evident {{at any time}} from infancy through early adulthood.

Initial symptoms include hepatic, neurologic, or psychiatric disorders and, rarely, renal, skeletal, or endocrine symptomatology. The disease progresses with deepening jaundice {{and the development of}} encephalopathy, severe clotting abnormalities, occasionally associated with intravascular coagulation, and terminal renal insufficiency. A peculiar type of tremor in the upper extremities, slowness of movement, and changes in temperament become apparent.
