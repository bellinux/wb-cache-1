5000|$|The modern {{fish fry}} {{tradition}} is strong in Wisconsin, {{where hundreds of}} eateries hold fish fries on Fridays, and sometimes on Wednesdays. The Friday night fish fry is a popular-year round tradition in Wisconsin among people of all religious backgrounds. Fish fries there are offered at many non-chain restaurants, taverns that serve food, some chain restaurants, and at Roman Catholic churches as fundraisers. A typical Wisconsin fish fry consists of beer batter fried cod, perch, bluegill, walleye, or in areas along the Mississippi River, catfish. The meal usually comes with tartar sauce, french fries or German-style potato pancakes, coleslaw, and rye bread, though baked beans are not uncommon. The tradition in Wisconsin began because Wisconsin was settled heavily by Catholics of German, Polish, and other backgrounds whose religion forbade eating meat on Fridays. The number of lakes in the state meant that eating fish became a popular alternative. [...] Scandinavian settlements in northern and eastern Wisconsin favored the fish boil, a variant on the fish fry, which involves heating potatoes, white fish, <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large cauldron.|$|E

It is necessary that one component has the concentration value and the other the flux value fixed at the boundaries. A simple example is worked out in detail.

40|$|Includes bibliography. Eutectic Freeze Crystallization (EFC) is a {{separation}} technique which involves simultaneous crystallization {{of water and}} solute under eutectic conditions. It {{can be applied to}} treatment of various industrial aqueous streams containing dissolved organic and inorganic contaminants, such as reverse osmosis (RO) retentate brine streams. Since antiscalants are dosed in RO feed streams, these become concentrated in the retentate brine stream and could have an undesirable effect on crystallization kinetics of both ice and salt in EFC. In this study, the impact of a phosphonate antiscalant on the kinetic processes of nucleation and growth in EFC was investigated. Firstly, the effect of an antiscalant on the thermodynamic phase equilibria of a binary Na 2 SO 4 aqueous solution was experimentally determined. The effect of the antiscalant on the nucleation and growth rates of both ice <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> continuous EFC process was then established for concentrations of 200, 350 and 500 mg/L of antiscalant.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the use of peach pomace in total mixed ration (TMR) silages and clarify the differences in aerobic stability between TMR and TMR silages caused by lactic acid bacteria (LAB).

The results indicated that the TMR silages with peach pomace were well fermented, with low pH and high lactic acid concentrations. The aerobic stability of TMR silages were significantly higher than that of TMR. Compared with TMR silages with alfalfa hay, TMR silage with Leymus chinensis hay was much more prone to deterioration. Although the dominant LAB were not identical in TMR, the same dominant species, Lactobacillus buchneri and Pediococcus acidilactici, were found in both types of TMR silages after 56 d of ensiling, and they may play an important role in the aerobic stability of TMR silages...|$|E
40|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} a {{promising}} {{source of energy}} in the context of sustainable development. Therefore, very low enthalpy geothermal systems (open or closed) are increasingly considered for heating or cooling houses and offices using groundwater energy. However, prior to the development of such systems, a feasibility study and an impact study of the system on groundwater ressources are required. Thereliability of such studies is highly dependent {{on the quality of the}} estimation of heat transfer parameters. This highlights the necessity of estimating properly such parameters. The objective of this study is to combine the use of heat and salt tracers to estimate simultaneously heat transfer and solute transport parameters in an alluvial aquifer. Additionally, coupling heat and salt tracing experiments is particularly useful for comparing heat transfer and solute transport processes occurring in the subsurface. An experimental field site, located near Liege (Belgium), is equipped with 21 piezometers drilled in the alluvial deposits of the Meuse River. These alluvial deposits are composed of a loess layer (3 m) overlying a sand and gravel layer which constitutes the alluvial aquifer (7 m). The coupled tracing experiment consists in injecting simultaneously heated water <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> piezometer and monitoring the evolution of groundwater temperature and salt concentration in a series of control panels set perpendicularly to groundwater flow. This coupled tracing experiment is then simulated using a numerical model. The estimation of heat transfer and solute transport parameters is obtained by calibrating this numerical model using inversion tools. The present study proposes a methodology coupling heat and salt tracing experiment for estimating heat transfer parameters at the field scale. Furthermore, this coupled tracing experiment shows that the comportment of heat and solute in the subsurface presents key differences...|$|E

40|$|In the {{irrigated}} western U. S. {{disposal of}} drainage water {{has become a}} significant economic and environmental liability. Development of irrigation water management practices that reduce drainage water volumes is essential. One strategy combines restricted drainage outflow (by plugging the drains) with deficit irrigation to maximize shallow groundwater consumption by crops, thus reducing drainage that needs disposal. This approach is not without potential pitfalls; upward movement of groundwater in response to crop water uptake may increase salt and sodium concentrations in the root zone. The purposes for this study were: to observe changes in the spatial and temporal distributions of SAR (sodium adsorption ratio) <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> field managed to minimize drainage discharge; to determine if in situ drainage reduction strategy affects SAR distribution in the soil profile; and to identify soil or management factors that can help explain field wide variability. We measured SAR, soil salinity (EC 1 : 1) and soil texture over 3 years in a 60 -ha irrigated field {{on the west side}} of the San Joaquin Valley, California. At the time we started our measurements, the field was beginning to be managed according to a shallow groundwater/drainage reduction strategy. Soil salinity and SAR were found to be highly correlated in the field. The observed spatial and temporal variability in SAR was largely a product of soil textural variations within the field and their associated variations in apparent leaching fraction. During the 3 -year study period, the percentage of the field in which the lower profile (90 - 180 cm) depth averaged SAR was above 10, increased from 20 to 40 %. Since salinity was increasing concomitantly with SAR, and because the soil contained gypsum, sodium hazard was not expected to become a limiting factor for long term shallow groundwater management by drain control. It is anticipated that the technology will be viable for future seasons. Drainage control Shallow groundwater management Sodium...|$|E
40|$|Free {{convection}} {{between two}} interconnected reservoirs, due to density differences maintained by heat and salt {{transfer to the}} reservoirs, is shown to occur sometimes in two different stable regimes, and may possibly be analogous to certain features of the oseanic circulation. The density of sea-water is modified while at the surface by two distinct processes: heating and cooling, which change the temperature, and precipitation and evaporation, which change the salinity. In many important oceanic regions these two density modifying processes work contrarily to one another. For exam le, the water in and above the main thermoc P,,. e in all subtropical oceans is able to float {{on top of the}} denser deep water (we neglect here all consideration of the “salt-fountain” effect) because its density is depressed through surface heating- but the excessive evaporation in these same latitudes is able to increase the salinity of the surface waters {{to such an extent that}} in general their density contrast with deep waters is only one half of what it would be on the basis of temperature alone. In some large semienclosed seas (e. g. Mediterranean and Red Seas) subject to similar surface heating and evaporation, the salinity can have a predominant influence on the density field. By qualitative comparison of these cases we form an impression that the heat transfer mechanism has a more rapid effect on the density of a newly arriving parcel of water, but that in the long run, given sufficient time, evaporation can reverse the thermal influence. We do not know enough about the details of oceanic circulation to pursue these questions in their full complexity in nature but we can explore their implications in simple idealized systems. That is all we propose to do here. First, let us consider a very simple system: a vessel of water stirred so as to maintain uniform tem erature T and salinity S. (fig. I). The walls o P the vessel are made of a porous substance which permits transfer of heat <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> simple linear fashion: dT-=c(T- T) dt d...|$|E
40|$|Three New Zealand marine species, hoki (Macruronus novaezealandiae), kahawai (Arripis trutta) and {{trevally}} (Pseudocaranx dentex) {{were used}} to develop model fermented fish sausage. The formulation comprised fish mince, carbohydrate, minced garlic <b>and</b> <b>salt</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> mass ratio of 1 (fish) : 0. 15 : 0. 05 : 0. 03, respectively. The carbohydrate source was cooked rice or glucose. (Endogenous lactic acid bacteria (LAB) failed to ferment rice). Folate was also added to the mixture as a factor. The mixtures were extruded into 50 mL plastic syringes, where the needle end of the barrel had been excised by lathe. The lubricated barrel was overfilled to 60 mL, capped {{with a layer of}} ParafilmTM and aluminium foil, sealed tightly by rubber band and incubated at 30 °C. Over time the piston was progressively advanced to yield samples for microbiological, physical, and chemical analysis. Over 96 hours an increase in the LAB count was observed with a concomitant decrease in pH. After fermentation was complete, the samples contained around 8. 77 log cfu LAB g- 1 with the pH range from 4. 38 to 5. 08. The microbiological and pH behaviour of each species varied between preparations. Hardness, adhesiveness, springiness and cohesiveness of the treatments increased with fermentation, except for hoki. The treatments showed different colour characteristics with fermentation. The light reflectance (L* values) of the trevally and kahawai treatments increased, while the a* (redness) and b* (yellowness) values decreased. Hoki exhibited smaller colour changes except for yellowness, which increased markedly. Proteolysis, measured colorimetrically by soluble peptide bonds, was greatest for trevally. Lipid oxidation, measured by the thiobarbituric acid method, was least for hoki, notably the species with the lowest fat content. Biogenic amines, which are a general quality indicator of fermented products, increased during fermentation. The trevally treatment generated the highest concentration of amines, but these values were lower than those reported for fermented fish sausage in Southeast Asia. Notably there were no important difference between folate treatments and those without folate. The results point to commercial opportunities and further research with New Zealand marine species, especially trevally. To improve the product quality and to show geographical exclusivity, further research could be done by using starter culture, and a New Zealand staple carbohydrate source such as kumara and potato, and spices and herbs which are commonly used in New Zealand, such as rosemary, thyme and sage or specific to New Zealand, such as horopito. In addition, sensory studies should also be performed before the products could be tested in the market...|$|E
