5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{transcriptional}} regulation of EFS, but several transcriptional regulators for EFS have been proposed based on consensus binding sites in its promoter region for ATF (Activating transcription factor), NF-κβ, NF-κβ1, GATA-3, C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha), glucocorticoid receptors α and β, and p53. Expression of isoforms 1 and 2 has been detected in multiple tissues, with maximal expression in the placenta, and the embryonal central nervous system, heart, testes and lungs. Although its expression has been reported as lower in thymus and lymphocytes, functional studies of EFS to date have best defined it <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> immune system function. One screen for implantation-related genes regulated by progesterone found that EFS was downregulated by 17β-estradiol and progesterone in explants of late proliferative phase endometrium.|$|E

25|$|It may be {{important}} to note that the Karaite and Rabbanite communities may have been theologically at odds, but often maintained good social and economic relations during the 10–13th centuries in Egypt, Palestine and Syria.

He was utterly orthodox in opposing divorce, contraception, abortion, the ordination of women and any idea of dropping clerical celibacy.|$|E
25|$|The company's {{activities}} were {{crucial for the}} development of the Chemiefaserkombinat Schwarza to a modern industrial park for industries of all kind. 1995, Peter Henkel founded a second company named EPC Technology GmbH. Today, both the EPC Engineering Consulting GmbH and the EPC Technology GmbH, as well as other companies, are subsidiaries of the EPC Holding GmbH, doing business as EPC Group. Ten years after its foundation, the EPC Group and all of its subsidiaries had about 150 employees. In the following years, exports continuously increased, especially to the Arab world, Asia and Russia. For example, the EPC Group built a plant for plastic granulates in Saudi Arabia, which is one of the largest revamp projects in the world. Similar facilities for the production of Polycarbonate have been built in China, with a capacity of more than 100,000 tons per year. These projects were recognized <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> both the company and the whole industry. In 2009, the EPC Group acquired the CRYOTEC Anlagenbau GmbH, a cryogenic plant construction company in Wurzen, Saxony, with roots going back to the year 1879. Today, the HI Bauprojekt GmbH and RMN Ingenieure GmbH are also part of the EPC Group.|$|E

25|$|In {{the lower}} and middle {{parts of the}} slopes old and non-fertilised meadows with fruit trees offer a blaze of colour of {{different}} flowers. With their high trunks the fruit groves provide the optimal habitat for a diversity of small animals, birds, and plants. The wryneck {{is one of the}} typical inhabitants of these meadows, because they avoid bleak areas and dense forests. Just <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> the small animals, birds, and plants are the various hedges and shrubs, which can be found everywhere on and around Hesselberg. In our farmed landscape hedges have the largest variety of microhabitats. In addition to the groves there is a herb layer—rich in species—a sunny herb fringe, coarse woody debris, and possibly special biotopes, such as the piles of stones. Because of the transition from water-permeable to impermeable rock layers several spring horizons have emerged, explaining the richness of the springs. On Hesselberg there are several deep wells, but most springs appear in the form of flat swamps. The special flora and fauna of the wells is not immediately obvious, because most of the organisms are microscopic. Sundew is a very rare plant found in these wetlands.|$|E

500|$|The Domesday Survey of 1086 {{does not}} {{directly}} mention Ashton, perhaps because only a partial survey of the area had been taken. However, {{it is thought that}} St Michael's Church, mentioned in the Domesday entry for the ancient parish of Manchester, was in Ashton (also spelt Asheton, Asshton and Assheton). The town itself was first mentioned in the 12thcentury when the manor was part of the barony of Manchester. By the late 12thcentury, a family who adopted the name Assheton held the manor on behalf of the Gresleys, barons of Manchester. Ashton Old Hall was a manor house, the administrative centre of the manor, and the seat of the de Ashton or de Assheton family. With three wings, the hall was [...] "one of the finest great houses in the North West" [...] of the 14thcentury. It has been recognised <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> being one of the few great houses in south-east Lancashire and possibly one of the few halls influenced by French design in the country. The town was granted a Royal Charter in 1414, which allowed it to hold a fair twice a year, and a market on every Monday, making the settlement a market town.|$|E

500|$|Cleveland Indians {{owner and}} team {{president}} Bill Veeck proposed integrating baseball in 1942, {{which had been}} informally segregated {{since the turn of}} the century, but this was rejected by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Veeck had begun the process of finding a young, talented player from the Negro leagues, and told a reporter in Cleveland that he would integrate the Indians' roster if he could find a black player with the necessary talent level who could withstand the taunts and pressure of being the first black athlete in the AL. The reporter suggested Doby, of whom Veeck had seen at the Great Lakes Naval Training School. Doby's name was also mentioned when Veeck talked with reporters who covered the Negro leagues. Indians scout Bill Killefer rated Doby favorably and perhaps just <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> Veeck, reported Doby's off-field behavior was not a concern. The Dodgers rated Doby their top young Negro league prospect. But unlike the Brooklyn Dodgers' Branch Rickey, who signed Robinson one full season before bringing him to the National League, Veeck used a different strategy, letting Doby remain with the Eagles instead of bringing him through the Indians' farm system. He told the Pittsburgh Courier, [...] "One afternoon when the team trots out on the field, a Negro player will be out there with it." ...|$|E
