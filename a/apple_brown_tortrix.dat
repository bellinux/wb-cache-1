40|$|Abstract. A {{characteristic}} wavelength {{for measuring}} flesh <b>browning</b> of <b>apple</b> was put forward based on FT-NIR spectroscopy. Cluster analysis algorithm based on Euclidean distance {{was applied to}} selection of representative samples. The multivariable analysis concluding PLS and MLR were applied to build the regression models and seek the characteristic wavelengths of <b>apple</b> flesh <b>browning.</b> The loading weights from PLS model found the sensitive flesh browning wavelengths. The significance of these wavelengths was by ANOVA, and seven wavelengths (1132, 1411, 1429, 1494, 1580, 1879, and 2151 nm) were selected with statistical significance at 95 % confidence level. These wavelengths were strongly related with <b>apple</b> flesh <b>browning</b> by MLR models evaluated with high prediction correlation (r= 0. 937). These suggest the model of <b>apple</b> flesh <b>browning</b> was reliable with good predict ability and can meet the requirement to quick determination of flesh <b>browning</b> of <b>apples...</b>|$|R

50|$|During the preparation, {{apples are}} cored for apple sauces {{but not for}} apple butter, {{allowing}} it to have a much stronger apple taste. The two also differ in cooking time; apple sauce just needs to be cooked until the apples are soft enough to be pureed, while apple butter needs to be cooked until the <b>apples</b> <b>brown,</b> break down and thicken. As {{a result of its}} long cooking time, apple butter is a much darker, caramel <b>brown</b> color, while <b>apple</b> sauce is usually a lighter golden color. Apple sauce has a more liquid consistency while apple butter is thicker and is more spreadable.|$|R

40|$|New Zealand’s major fruit {{industries}} are dependent upon producing high-quality crops for export {{with a very}} low incidence of pest damage. Light <b>brown</b> <b>apple</b> moth was an economi-cally important pest within the fruit sector in the 1960 s through the 1980 s, and it developed resistance to broad-spectrum insecticides. The increase in its pest status focused research on biological control, and existing native natural enemies were augmented with new introductions from Australia in the late 1960 s. By the early 1990 s, this effort resulted in substantially reduced leafroller populations and fruit damage. The implementation of integrated pest management (IPM) programs in the New Zealand fruit sector in the mid-to late 1990 s practically eliminated the use of broad-spectrum organo-phosphate insecticides, further en-hancing natural control. Today light <b>brown</b> <b>apple</b> moth is successfully managed in IPM and organic pro-grams {{through a combination of}} bio-logical control and threshold-based applications of selective insecticides. The recent discovery of light <b>brown</b> <b>apple</b> moth, a leafroller, in Califor-nia may affect the management of fruit crops, and because it is a quarantine pest in some markets, the discovery has already had implications for do-mestic and export trade in produce and nursery stock. In New Zealand, light <b>brown</b> <b>apple</b> moth, Epiphyas postvittana (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), was first reported in 1891 (Hudson 1928). It be-came a major pest, primarily of pome fruit (apples and pears) and berry fruit, and a minor pest of grapes, citrus, stone fruit and kiwi fruit. The number of acres planted to pome and berry fruit — the crops most affected by light <b>brown</b> <b>apple</b> moth — is similar in New Zealand and California (table 1). New Zealand went through a phase from the 1960 s to 1980 s when light <b>brown</b> <b>apple</b> moth caused major fruit damage; in apple crops this averaged from 8 % to 26 % and as high as 48 % (Collyer and van Geldermalsen 1975). Control programs were based on fre-quent applications of broad-spectrum insecticides. This led to the develop-ment of resistance to organochlorines in the early 1960 s (Collyer and va...|$|R
