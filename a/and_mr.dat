5|$|Mansfield {{attempted}} to defuse public concern by staging the London {{opening of the}} comedy Prince Karl as a charity performance, despite Stoker's warning that critics would view it {{as an attempt to}} obtain favorable publicity for the production.

Despite widespread publicity due to the murders and Mansfield's disputes with Bandmann, attendance was mediocre, and the production was losing money. On December 1, Mansfield's tenancy at the Lyceum ended. He left London, taking his company on a tour of England.
