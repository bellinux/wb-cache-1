5|$|The western jackdaw {{is one of}} a {{very small}} number of birds that it is legal to use as a decoy or to trap in a cage in the United Kingdom. The other pest species that can be {{controlled}} by trapping are the crow, jay, magpie and rook. An <b>authorised</b> <b>person</b> must comply with the requirements of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and does not need to show that the birds were a nuisance before trapping them. As of 2003 the western jackdaw was listed as a potential species for targeted hunting in the European Union Birds Directive, and hunting has been encouraged by German hunting associations. Permission to shoot western jackdaws in spring and summer exists in Cyprus as they are thought (incorrectly) to prey on gamebirds.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{the damage}} they do, there have been {{attempts}} to control the numbers of both native and introduced populations of common starlings. Within the natural breeding range, this may be affected by legislation. For example, in Spain, this is a species hunted commercially as a food item, and has a close season, whereas in France, it is classed as a pest, and the season in which it may be killed covers {{the greater part of}} the year. In Great Britain Starlings are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which makes it [...] "illegal to intentionally kill, injure or take a starling, or to take, damage or destroy an active nest or its contents". The Wildlife Order in Northern Ireland allows, with a general licence, [...] "an <b>authorised</b> <b>person</b> to control starlings to prevent serious damage to agriculture or preserve public health and safety". This species is migratory, so birds involved in control measures may have come from a wide area and breeding populations may not be greatly affected. In Europe, the varying legislation and mobile populations mean that control attempts may have limited long-term results. Non-lethal techniques such as scaring with visual or auditory devices have only a temporary effect in any case.|$|E

2500|$|Number {{plates were}} {{initially}} {{made by the}} motor vehicle's original supplier, and replacement plates meeting standards could be made by anybody. Some people had street address numbers made up to motor-vehicle standards for their houses. From 2001 plates sold in England and Wales had to be provided by a supplier on the DVLA's Register of Number Plate Suppliers (RNPS) as specified in British Standard BSAU145d. The supplier needs {{to confirm that the}} customer is the registered keeper or other <b>authorised</b> <b>person</b> and verify their identity. The name and postcode of the supplier must be shown {{at the bottom of the}} plate. Number plates in the UK are usually flat and made of plastic; embossed aluminium plates are available from some suppliers. [...] These rules are generally described as onerous, particularly to company car drivers who do not hold any of the required paperwork themselves (such items usually being stored by a fleet manager or lease hire company).|$|E
