A heat sink is a passive component that cools semiconductor and optoelectronic devices by dissipating heat into the surrounding <b>air.</b> <b>Heat</b> sinks have temperatures higher than their surrounding environments so that heat can be transferred into the air by convection, radiation, and conduction.|$|E

They can also be suitable for liquid cooling applications. Copper is specified in supply and return manifolds and in tube coils.|$|E

The paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} the investigation the aim of which was to find new easily to accessible materials which are possible to be used as absorbers in <b>air</b> <b>heating</b> sun collectors. Different size seed boxes made of polypropylene were used as such materials and each box value efficiency in <b>air</b> <b>heating</b> was defined. The experimental results of the sun following collector by air movement 0. 9 m·s- 1, show that in <b>air</b> <b>heating</b> cylindrical type boxes absorber with the size R= 2. 5 cm and H= 7 cm (7 boxes in line) is more effective, which is warming up air on average by 1. 6 ˚C on 100 W·m- 2 at the collector size 0. 1 x 0. 5 x 1. 0 m it is <b>air</b> <b>heating</b> level by 1000 W·m- 2 is reaching 16 ˚C.

The <b>air</b> <b>heating</b> level is dependent on the box size it is out of the available absorbent surface.

25|$|What {{is often}} {{confusing}} about the Celsius measurement {{is that it}} follows an interval system but not a ratio system; that it follows a relative scale not an absolute scale. This is put simply by illustrating that while 10°C and 20°C have the same interval difference as 20°C and 30°C the temperature 20°C is not twice the <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> energy as 10°C. As this example shows, degrees Celsius is a useful interval measurement but does not possess the characteristics of ratio measures like weight or distance.|$|E

Items such as a stove, dish washer, clothes dryer, hot water and incandescent lighting all add heat to the home. Low power or insulated versions of these devices give off less heat for the {{air conditioning}} to remove. The air conditioning system can also improve in efficiency by using a heat sink that is cooler than the standard <b>air</b> <b>heat</b> exchanger such as geothermal or water.|$|E

2500|$|Thermal contact {{resistance}} occurs {{due to the}} voids created by surface roughness effects, defects and misalignment of the interface. The voids present in the interface are filled with <b>air.</b> <b>Heat</b> transfer is therefore due to conduction across the actual contact area and to conduction (or natural convection) and radiation across the gaps. If the contact area is small, {{as it is for}} rough surfaces, the major contribution to the resistance is made by the gaps.
