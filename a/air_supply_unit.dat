40|$|Most launch {{vehicles}} and satellites in the US inventory rely upon {{the use of}} hypergolic rocket propellants, {{many of which are}} toxic to humans. These fuels and oxidizers, such as hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide have threshold limit values as low as 0. 01 PPM. It is essential to provide space workers handling these agents whole body protection as they are universally hazardous not only to the respiratory system, but the skin as well. This paper describes a new method for powering a whole body protective garment to assure the safety of ground servicing crews. A new technology has been developed through the small business innovative research program at the Kennedy Space Center. Currently, liquid air is used in the environmental control unit (ECU) that powers the propellant handlers suit (PHE). However, liquid air exhibits problems with attitude dependence, oxygen enrichment, and difficulty with reliable quantity measurement. The new technology employs the storage of the <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> as a supercritical gas. This method of air storage overcomes all of three problems above while maintaining high density storage at relatively low vessel pressures (< 7000 kPa or approximately 1000 psi). A one hour prototype ECU was developed and tested to prove the feasibility of this concept. This was upgraded by the design of a larger supercritical dewar capable of holding 7 Kg of <b>air,</b> a <b>supply</b> which provides a 2 hour duration to the PHE. A third version is being developed to test the feasibility of replacing existing air cooling methodology with a liquid cooled garment for relief of heat stress in this warm Florida environment. Testing of the first one hour prototype yielded data comparable to the liquid air powered predecessor, but enjoyed advantages of attitude independence and oxygen level stability. Thermal data revealed heat stress relief at least as good as liquid <b>air</b> <b>supplied</b> <b>units.</b> The application of supercritical air technology to this whole body protective ensemble marked an advancement in the state-of-the-art in personal protective equipment. Not only was long duration environmental control provided, but it was done without a high pressure vessel. The unit met human performance needs for attitude independence, oxygen stability and relief of heat stress. This supercritical air (and oxygen) technology is suggested for microgravity applications in life support such as the Extravehicular Mobility Unit. c 2001. Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Traditional {{heat pump}} systems <b>supply</b> {{conditioned}} <b>air</b> to space at certain temperatures such as, in summer, about 16 °C. When the supply-air temperature drops too low, most occupants {{tend to feel}} uncomfortable. On the other hand, {{a certain amount of}} dehumidification has to be carried out and sometimes, the velocity of supply-air has to be high which in turn creates a draught. This paper introduces a new <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> method to reduce fan power consumption as well as to improve thermal comfort of occupants. Using this method, colder fresh air at 13 °C is generated by air handling units and pumped to the ceiling <b>supplies.</b> As <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> temperature is lower, less air flow rate is required to meet the latent load. The reduced air flow rate decreases the fan power consumption. The <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> <b>units</b> mounted on the ceiling are specially designed so that space air flows upwards to inside due to negative pressure created by the <b>supply</b> <b>unit</b> and mixed with the 13 °C cold air. The mixed air consists of roughly 60 % return air and 40 % fresh air at 13 °C. Due to the mixing process, the <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> temperature is around 19 °C and <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> velocity is around 0. 7 m/s. Both the supply temperature and velocity are more thermally-favored compared to those from traditional units. A commercially-available computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool was used to evaluate the operative temperature as well as air velocity distribution inside an office-setting equipped with induced-air <b>supply</b> <b>unit</b> for both heating and cooling cases. Since the air velocity may change due to various latent loads, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) technique was applied to study the thermal comfort conditions when air velocity changes between 0. 1 m/s to 1 m/s. The POD method uses a sophisticated interpolation method based on a set of CFD snapshots which are generated once beforehand. The method can reduce the computation time from hours for CFD to seconds when predicting temperature and velocity fields at different <b>supply</b> <b>air</b> velocities. The model outputs are compared with field measured data for model validation. The simulation results show that the induced-air <b>supply</b> <b>unit</b> creates a good thermal comfort conditions for the occupants in terms of predicted mean vote (PMV).

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} {{for heating}} and ventilation of buildings {{is still in}} 2011 considered far too high, {{but there are many}} ways to save energy and construct lowenergy buildings that have not been fully utilised. This doctoral thesis has focused onone of these - low temperature heating systems. Particular attention has been given tothe ventilation radiator adapted for exhaust-ventilated buildings because of itspotential as a low energy consuming, easily-operated, environmentally-friendlysystem that might also ensure occupant health and well-being. Investigations were based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations andanalytical calculations, with laboratory experiments used for validation. Main conclusions: Low and very low temperature heating systems, such as floor heating, in general createan indoor climate with low air speeds and low temperature differences in the room, whichis beneficial for thermal comfort. A typical disadvantage, however, was found to beweakness in counteracting cold down-flow from ventilation <b>air</b> <b>supply</b> <b>units</b> in exhaustventilatedbuildings. with ventilation radiators, unlike most other low temperature systems, it was found thatthe risk of cold draught could be reduced while still maintaining a high ventilation rateeven in cold northern European winters. ventilation radiators were found to be more thermally efficient than traditional radiators. design of ventilation radiators could be further modified for improved thermal efficiency. at an outdoor temperature of - 15 °C the most efficient models were able to give doublethe heat output of traditional radiators. Also, by substituting the most efficient ventilationradiators for traditional radiators operating at 55 °C supply water temperature, it wasfound that supply water temperature could be reduced to 35 °C while heat outputremained the same and comfort criteria were met. lowering the supply water temperature by 20 °C (as described above) could givecombined energy savings for heating and ventilation of 14 - 30 % in a system utilising aheat pump. supply water temperatures as low as 35 °C could increase potential for utilising lowtemperature heat sources such as sun-, ground-, water- or waste-heat. This would beparticularly relevant to new-built “green” energy-efficient buildings, but severaladvantages may apply to retrofit applications as well. Successful application of ventilation radiators requires understanding of relevant buildingfactors, and the appropriate number, positioning and size of radiators for best effect. Evaluation studies must be made at the level of the building as a whole, not just for theheating-ventilation system. This work demonstrated that increased use of well-designed ventilation radiatorarrangements can help to meet regulations issued in 2008 by the Swedish Departmentof Housing (Boverket BBR 16) and goals set in the Energy Performance of BuildingsDirective (EPBD) in the same year.
