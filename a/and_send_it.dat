5|$|Despite ineffectual {{long-range}} gunfire {{towards the}} British ship by {{the remainder of}} the Spanish squadron, the isolated Santa Dorotea was rapidly forced to surrender, O'Neil eventually turning the other three frigates back towards Cartagena. Unopposed, Dixon was able to consolidate his prize <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>it</b> to St Vincent's fleet off Cadiz, where it was subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy. Lion remained in the Mediterranean during the year, later participating in the blockades of Malta and Alexandria. The Spanish, their seaports carefully guarded by Royal Navy squadrons, launched no further expeditions into the Mediterranean during the year.|$|E

By July, {{he was able to}} complete the poem and in October the poem was edited and ready for publication. John Rickman served as Southey's agent in selling the book. Although finished, Southey continued to work on fixing the end of the poem until January 1801 after receiving suggestions from his friends. After Portugal went to war with France and Spain, Southey left the country and he returned to England in June 1801. The poem was published in 1801 by Longman with 1,000 copies, but only sold half by 1804. A revised edition was published in 1809.|$|E
5|$|On 9 December 1940 the Western Desert Force {{under the}} command of Major General Richard O'Connor {{attacked}} the Italian position at Sidi Barrani. The position was captured, 38,000 Italian soldiers were taken prisoner, and the remainder of the Italian force was driven back. The Western Desert Force pursued the Italians into Libya, and the 7th Armoured Division established itself to the west of Bardia, cutting off land communications between the strong Italian garrison there and Tobruk. On 11 December, Wavell decided to withdraw the 4th Indian Division <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>it</b> to the Sudan to participate in the East African Campaign. Major General Iven Mackay's 6th Australian Division was brought forward from Egypt to replace it. Mackay assumed command of the area on 21 December 1940.|$|E

5|$|After {{the train}} departs from the station, it {{immediately}} begins {{to climb the}} vertical (90 degree) lift hill. Upon reaching {{the top of the}} lift, the train turns 45 degrees backwards putting the train and its riders in an upside down position. Then, as the train exits the lift, it goes through a heartline roll before going down the only drop in the layout of the roller coaster. The train speeds through the station going back up the lift. Once it loses momentum the train then returns down passing through the station again. It then proceeds back up the drop and partially into the heartline roll before once again losing momentum and returning to the ground. After passing the station for the third time, the train is stopped {{near the top of the}} lift hill. It is then lowered back down to the station where the next riders board the train. The XT 150 has the option of sending riders around a second cycle at the operator's discretion. When the train stops on the lift hill at the end of the ride, instead of lowering slowly back to the station, the chain will raise the car up <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>it</b> through the ride again.|$|E
5|$|In Game 6 of the 2011 World Series, {{with the}} Texas Rangers leading the game 7–5, and leading the series by 3 games to 2, Freese came to bat {{in the bottom}} of the ninth with two out and two men on base. With a count of one ball and two strikes, Freese hit a two-run triple off Neftalí Feliz just out of the reach of Nelson Cruz to tie the game <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>it</b> to extra innings. In the 11th inning, again with two strikes, Freese hit a game-winning lead-off, walk-off, solo home-run to deep center field (420feet), to send the World Series to its first Game 7 since 2002. Freese joined Jim Edmonds, the man he was traded for, as the only players in Cardinals history to hit an extra-inning walk-off home run in the postseason. He joined Aaron Boone (2003), David Ortiz (2004) and Hall of Famers Carlton Fisk (1975) and Kirby Puckett (1991) as the only players to hit an extra-inning walk-off home run when their team was facing postseason elimination.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half, defense {{continued}} to dominate as Tech built a lead. The Hokies scored the only points {{of a third}} quarter as running back Lee Suggs ran {{into the end zone}} from one yard out, allowing Tech to take a 17–10 lead into the fourth quarter. The Falcons didn't give up easily, however. Air Force kicker Joey Ashcroft cut into the Tech lead with a 21-yard field goal. Tech matched the score later in the quarter to restore the one-touchdown lead. As time ran down, Air Force had one final chance to tie the game <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>it</b> into overtime. Beginning at its own 18-yard line with 4:11 left to play, the Falcons drove deep into Tech territory. With seven seconds remaining, Air Force quarterback Chance Harridge tried to scramble into the end zone, but was stopped before the goal line by Tech cornerback Ronyell Whitaker. The defensive stop preserved the 20–13 Hokie victory, and Tech quarterback Bryan Randall was named the game's most valuable player.|$|E

5|$|The Phillies {{ended the}} month with a five-game series, {{continuing}} into June, against the New York Mets. Although Buchanan's second major-league {{start in the}} series opener was a quality start, the Phillies offense managed one run for a 4–1 loss. The last two games of May went 14 innings apiece, with the Phillies winning the first and losing the second. In the first game A. J. Burnett threw seven innings and allowed five runs, after which six relievers threw a combined seven scoreless innings. Ruiz had four hits and Brown had four RBIs; Reid Brignac hit a walk-off RBI single to left field in the 14th inning, scoring Byrd for a 6–5 win. The next night, after the Phillies fell behind 4–0, Howard hit a seventh-inning three-run home run; {{in the bottom of}} the ninth, Brown hit an RBI single to tie the game <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>it</b> into extra innings.
