5|$|Diaby {{was born}} in the 10th {{arrondissement}} of Paris, but was raised in the Parisian commune of Aubervilliers. He began his football career playing for hometown club CM Aubervilliers. In 1998, he joined Red Star Paris. A year later, Diaby was selected to attend the Clairefontaine academy. He spent four years at the academy while simultaneously training with Red Star. A year before departing Clairefontaine, Diaby moved to professional club Paris Saint-Germain. Following an <b>administrative</b> <b>error</b> by club officials which made Diaby a free agent, he joined the academy of Auxerre. He spent two years in the club's youth academy before making his professional debut in the 2004–05 season. Diaby also played in the UEFA Cup with the club. After spending the Autumn portion of the 2005–06 season with Auxerre, in January 2006, Diaby signed with English club Arsenal on a long-term contract for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut with the club that same month and scored his first goal three months later against Aston Villa.|$|E

5|$|In August 1914, at the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Hitler was living in Munich and voluntarily enlisted in the Bavarian Army. According to a 1924 report by the Bavarian authorities, allowing Hitler to serve was almost certainly an <b>administrative</b> <b>error,</b> since as an Austrian citizen, {{he should have been}} returned to Austria. Posted to the Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16 (1st Company of the List Regiment), he served as a dispatch runner on the Western Front in France and Belgium, spending nearly half his time at the regimental headquarters in Fournes-en-Weppes, well behind the front lines. He was present at the First Battle of Ypres, the Battle of the Somme, the Battle of Arras, and the Battle of Passchendaele, and was wounded at the Somme. He was decorated for bravery, receiving the Iron Cross, Second Class, in 1914. On a recommendation by Lieutenant Hugo Gutmann, Hitler's Jewish superior, he received the Iron Cross, First Class on 4 August 1918, a decoration rarely awarded to one of Hitler's Gefreiter rank. He received the Black Wound Badge on 18 May 1918.|$|E

50|$|Host-based zoning {{is usually}} {{referred}} to as persistent binding or LUN, and is perhaps the least implemented form of zoning. Because it requires the host configuration to be correct {{in order to avoid}} zoning conflicts, this form of zoning creates a greater opportunity for <b>administrative</b> <b>errors</b> and conflicting access to targets. Moreover zoning interfaces vary among different host operating systems and HBA's — increasing the possibility for <b>administrative</b> <b>errors.</b> If a host is not configured with the zoning software, it can access all devices in the fabric and create an even higher probability of data corruption. Host-based zoning is often used when clusters are implemented to control the mapping of devices to specific target IDs. However, it should never be the only form of zoning. Augmenting host-based zoning with storage- and fabric-based zoning is the only acceptable method to reliably control device access and data security.|$|R

2500|$|Rasmussen was {{the center}} of {{controversy}} while wearing the yellow jersey in the 2007 Tour de France, when it was announced that he had been suspended from the Danish national cycling team at UCI World Championships and Olympic Games following missed doping controls. Rasmussen failed to report his whereabouts for a three-week training session in Mexico and was unavailable for testing during that period; for that he received a recorded warning from the UCI. Counting these missed tests together, the Danish cycling union decided to ban Rasmussen. Rasmussen said: [...] "I do admit that I've committed an <b>administrative</b> <b>error.</b> I was informed of this at the Danish championship {{two and a half weeks}} ago, so it's no news... It might be a surprise that it comes out right now." [...] The timing of the announcement led to speculation by Patrice Clerc, then chief of the Amaury Sport Organisation, which organises the Tour de France, that the UCI had leaked the news in the middle of the Tour to damage it, as part of a dispute between the two organisations over the running of the UCI ProTour. This was rejected by the UCI president Pat McQuaid, who said the timing was the choice of the Danish cycling union.|$|E

Methods: All the prescriptions filled during an hour on three consecutive days were taken aside to be analyzed later. Time spent in the correction of the met <b>administrative</b> <b>errors</b> was measured. Results: 64 % of all of the analyzed prescriptions contained at least one error. More errors were found in hand-written prescriptions (86 %) than in computer-produced prescriptions (33 %). The most common error was the one related to the prescription date (100 % of all the erroneous prescriptions). According to these data, we can estimate that to correct these errors 15. 25 working hours per month are needed...|$|R
