They travel {{along the shore}} during foraging trips, and the individuals that occupy the same bay may change daily. Some individual dolphins do not <b>always</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a bay to rest; however, in Hawaii, dolphins do seem {{to return to the}} same site each trip.|$|E
500|$|While {{investigating}} the VIN from an axle {{of the truck}} used in the explosion and {{the remnants of the}} license plate, federal agents were able to link the truck to a specific Ryder rental agency in Junction City, Kansas. Using a sketch created with the assistance of Eldon Elliot, owner of the agency, the agents were able to implicate McVeigh in the bombing. McVeigh was also identified by Lea McGown of the Dreamland Motel, who remembered him parking a large yellow Ryder truck in the lot; McVeigh had signed in under his real name at the motel, using an address that matched the one on his forged license and the charge sheet at the Perry Police Station. Before signing his real name at the motel, McVeigh had used false names for his transactions. However, McGown noted, [...] "People are so used to signing their own name that when they go to sign a phony name, they almost <b>always</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> write, and then look up for a moment as if to remember the new name they want to use. That's what [...] did, and when he looked up I started talking to him, and it threw him." ...|$|E

2500|$|There are {{two classes}} of CTCs.

For the latter, we can <b>always</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the universal covering space, and reestablish causality. For the former, such a procedure is not possible. [...] No closed timelike curve is contractible to a point by a timelike homotopy among timelike curves, as that point would not be causally well behaved.|$|E

2500|$|The {{simplest}} {{situation in}} which we can determine convergence is when the spectral sequences degenerates. [...] We say that the spectral sequences degenerates at sheet r if, for any s ≥ r, the differential ds is zero. [...] This implies that Er ≅ [...] E'r+1 ≅ E'r+2 ≅ ... In particular, it implies that Er is isomorphic to E∞. [...] This is what happened in our first, trivial example of an unfiltered chain complex: The spectral sequence degenerated at the first sheet. [...] In general, if a doubly graded spectral sequence is zero outside of a horizontal or vertical strip, the spectral sequence will degenerate, because later differentials will <b>always</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> or from an object not in the strip.|$|E
2500|$|An ant-based {{computer}} simulation using only six interaction rules {{has also been}} used to evaluate aircraft boarding behaviour. Airlines have also used ant-based routing in assigning aircraft arrivals to airport gates. An airline system developed by Douglas A. Lawson uses swarm theory, or swarm intelligence—the idea that a colony of ants works better than one alone. Each pilot acts like an ant searching for the best airport gate. [...] "The pilot learns from his experience what's the best for him, {{and it turns out}} that that's the best solution for the airline," [...] Lawson explains. As a result, the [...] "colony" [...] of pilots <b>always</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> gates they can arrive and depart quickly. The program can even alert a pilot of plane back-ups before they happen. [...] "We can anticipate that it's going to happen, so we'll have a gate available," [...] says Lawson.|$|E
2500|$|Norton {{was given}} the motivational book Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill, which, as he states in his autobiography, Going the Distance, changed his life. Shortly before he died, Norton stated [...] "Think and Grow Rich changed my life dramatically. I was going to fight Muhammad Ali. I was a green fighter, but yet I won, all through reading this book." [...] Upon reading Think and Grow Rich, he went on a 14-fight winning streak, {{including}} the shocking victory noted above over Muhammad Ali in 1973 to win the North American Boxing Federation heavyweight champion title. To quote Norton from his autobiography noted above, [...] "These words (from Napoleon Hill's Think and Grow Rich) were the final inspiration in my victory over Ali: Life's battles don't <b>always</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the stronger or faster man, {{but sooner or later}} the man who wins is the man who thinks he can." [...] Norton also took a complete course by Napoleon Hill on gaining wealth and peace of mind. [...] "It can be related to anybody, to be the best in a career, to think positive", said Norton.|$|E

2500|$|AllMusic editor Matt Collar {{stated that}} Goulding [...] "dresses up her {{powerful}} lark {{of a voice}} with a delicately laced veil of digital effects." [...] He continued, [...] "An ambitious work by an artist intent on developing her total sound, Halcyon finds Goulding poised {{at the edge of}} artistic and career possibilities." [...] In a review for Rolling Stone, Will Hermes expressed, [...] "If the songwriting doesn't quite measure up to U.K. art-pop divas like Kate Bush, the hooks <b>always</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> town, and her voice—Dolly Parton-dazzling in the upper register—mates gorgeously with electronics". PopMatters' Geoff Nelson concluded, [...] "On Halcyon Goulding amplifies her music genealogy, both who she is and who she's been, in what is an often successful attempt to transition to iconic stardom [...] The outcome is a bit flawed and a very loud version of her biggest and smallest self." [...] USA Todays Jerry Shriver viewed that on Halcyon, Goulding [...] "presents an edgier, more aggressive showcase for her swooping, stratosphere-piercing vibrato", while noting that [...] "er tone, balanced between girlish and womanly, is appealing, as is her clear intent to be an Artist. One wishes, however, she'd frolic in the heather now and then for contrast." [...] Despite calling the album a [...] "well-crafted, stylish piece of work", Andy Gill of The Independent felt that [...] "it's hard to love songs that try to hide." [...] The Guardians Rebecca Nicholson opined that the album [...] "isn't nearly as wet as its predecessor", but added that [...] "the main flaw of Halcyon is that it occasionally feels a bit too much—and that's something Goulding, perennially painted as the timid type, may not be so sad about." [...] Hayley Avron of the NME critiqued, [...] "Mainly, Halcyon sees Goulding's quirky-as-usual vocals lazily spliced into factory-standard chart dance. On 'Joy' and 'I Know You Care' her artistry is briefly allowed to breathe, away from the desperate bombast of the suffocating backing tracks." ...|$|E
