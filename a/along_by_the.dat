5|$|After the windmill, {{wind power}} {{applications}} in other devices and even vehicles {{were found in}} China. There was the 'sailing carriage' that appeared by at least the Ming dynasty in the 16th century (although {{it could have been}} known beforehand). European travelers to China in the late 16th century were surprised to find large single-wheel passenger and cargo wheelbarrows not only pulled by mule or horse, but also mounted with ship-like masts and sails to help push them <b>along</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> wind.|$|E
5|$|Unlike birds, {{many small}} insects are swept <b>along</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{prevailing}} winds {{although many of}} the larger insects are known to make migrations. Aphids are known to be transported long distances by low-level jet streams. As such, fine line patterns associated with converging winds within weather radar imagery, like the WSR-88D radar network, often represent large groups of insects.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{theories}} prevailing at the time, light traveling through a moving medium would be dragged <b>along</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> medium, {{so that the}} measured speed of the light would be a simple sum of its speed through the medium plus {{the speed of the}} medium. Fizeau indeed detected a dragging effect, but the magnitude of the effect that he observed was far lower than expected. His results seemingly supported the partial aether-drag hypothesis of Fresnel, a situation that was disconcerting to most physicists. Over half a century passed before a satisfactory explanation of Fizeau's unexpected measurement was developed with the advent of Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity. Einstein later pointed out the importance of the experiment for special relativity, in which it corresponds to the relativistic velocity-addition formula when restricted to small velocities.|$|E

5|$|For cargo transport, the Byzantines usually commandeered {{ordinary}} merchantmen as transport ships (phortēgoi) or supply ships (skeuophora). These {{appear to}} have been mostly sailing vessels, rather than oared. The Byzantines and Arabs also employed horse-transports (hippagōga), which were either sailing ships or galleys, the latter certainly modified to accommodate the horses. Given that the chelandia appear originally to have been oared horse-transports, this would imply differences in construction between the chelandion and the dromōn proper, terms which otherwise are often used indiscriminately in literary sources. While the dromōn was developed exclusively as a war galley, the chelandion would have had to have a special compartment amidships to accommodate a row of horses, increasing its beam and hold depth. In addition, Byzantine sources refer to the sandalos or sandalion (σάνδαλος, σανδάλιον), which was a boat carried <b>along</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bigger ships. The kind described in the De Ceremoniis had a single mast, four oars and a rudder.|$|E
5|$|The {{goldcrest}} takes a {{wide variety}} of prey, especially spiders, caterpillars, bugs, springtails and flies. Larger prey such as oak bush crickets and tortrix moths may sometimes be taken. Flying insects are taken in hovering flight but not normally pursued; there is a record of a goldcrest attacking a large dragonfly in flight, only to be dragged <b>along</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> insect before releasing it unharmed. Goldcrests will occasionally feed on the ground among leaf-litter with tits. Non-animal food is rare, although goldcrests have been seen drinking sap from broken birch twigs together with tits and nuthatches.|$|E
5|$|On 14 August 2007, Steve Cotterill, {{manager of}} fellow Championship club Burnley, {{made an offer}} of £200,000 for Carlisle, who signed a three-year {{contract}} at Turf Moor two days later. Helped <b>along</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> club captain Steven Caldwell, Carlisle settled in well at Burnley. Two days after signing, he made his debut for his new club in the 2–0 defeat away to Scunthorpe United. Carlisle scored his first goal for Burnley on 22 September 2007, netting a stoppage time minute equaliser with an overhead kick in the 2–2 draw with Bristol City at Ashton Gate. On 28 September 2007, the day before a Championship match, {{he was involved in}} a serious car crash after spinning and crashing into a ditch causing his car to be written off. Steve Cotterill praised Carlisle's character for playing the next day in the 1–1 draw with Crystal Palace. He and Caldwell formed a solid defensive partnership and played most matches of the season together. Carlisle was named in the official Team of the Week for his performance in Burnley's 3–1 away win at Charlton Athletic. His partnership with Caldwell was broken {{towards the end of the}} campaign as Carlisle was given suspensions after being sent off twice in his last four matches of the season, first in the 1–2 loss to Preston and then in the last match of the season, a 0–5 defeat at Crystal Palace. Carlisle ended the 2007–08 season with two goals in 35 appearances.|$|E

25|$|Controversy {{surrounding}} {{the discovery of}} the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) was intense after American researcher Robert Gallo and French scientist Luc Montagnier both claimed to have discovered it.

25|$|A {{wind speed}} {{gradient}} of 4 (m/s)/km can produce refraction equal to a typical {{temperature lapse rate}} of 7.5°C/km. Higher values of wind gradient will refract sound downward toward the surface in the downwind direction, eliminating the acoustic shadow on the downwind side. This will increase the audibility of sounds downwind.

25|$|Specific trap {{sites for}} heavy mineral sand placer {{deposits}} are in beaches on the leeward side of headlands, as this forms a low-energy zone which traps sediments carried <b>along</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> longshore drift.
