By assuming the responsibilities of fiction editor and reviewing <b>almost</b> <b>nothing</b> but novels, she used her editorial position at Joseph Johnson's Analytical Review to educate herself regarding novelistic techniques. She even visited Bedlam Hospital in February 1797 to research insane asylums.|$|E
5|$|<b>Almost</b> <b>nothing</b> {{is known}} about the {{childhood}} of Marco Polo until he was fifteen years old, excepting that he probably spent part of his childhood in Venice. Meanwhile, Marco Polo's mother died, and an aunt and uncle raised him. He received a good education, learning mercantile subjects including foreign currency, appraising, and the handling of cargo ships; he learned little or no Latin. His father later married Floradise Polo (née Trevisan).|$|E
5|$|<b>Almost</b> <b>nothing</b> {{is left of}} the Bastille except some {{remains of}} its stone {{foundation}} that were relocated to the side of Boulevard Henri IV. Historians were critical of the Bastille in the early 19th century, and believe the fortress to have been a relatively well-administered institution, but deeply implicated in the system of French policing and political control during the 18th century.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Saint Padarn (or Paternus to use his Latin name), and <b>almost</b> <b>nothing</b> {{with any degree of}} certainty; the {{earliest}} literary reference to him is by Rhygyfarch in about 1097. However, it is possible to construct a general outline of his life from the little that we do have.|$|E
5|$|After closure, {{the line}} was largely forgotten. Because it had been built on private land without an Act of Parliament, few records of it prior to the Oxford {{extension}} schemes exist in official archives. At {{least some of the}} rails remained in place in 1940, as records exist of their removal during the building of RAF Westcott. Other than the station buildings at Westcott and Quainton Road <b>almost</b> <b>nothing</b> survives of the tramway, although much of the route can still be traced by a double line of hedges. The former trackbed between Quainton Road and Waddesdon Road is now a public footpath known as the Tramway Walk.|$|E
5|$|<b>Almost</b> <b>nothing</b> {{is known}} about the natural history of the Borneo shark. It is {{viviparous}} like other requiem sharks; the females bear litters of six pups, which are provisioned through gestation by a placental connection. The International Union for Conservation of Nature last assessed this species as Endangered, at which time it had not been seen since 1937. While an extant population has since been found, the Borneo shark continues to merit conservation concern given its highly limited range within heavily fished waters.|$|E

5|$|At about 8:30am {{the wooden}} {{construction}} of {{the main part of}} the building also burned through and collapsed. Despite the fact that there were still people in the building and more people were lying around the building severely injured, the fire fighters decided to withdraw. The fire department proceeded to extinguish the smoking debris, and at 9:30am the fire was declared under control. The building's collapse left a gaping hole; of the hotel, the furniture store and the book store, <b>almost</b> <b>nothing</b> remained.|$|E
5|$|Caligula had {{two large}} ships {{constructed}} for himself (which were {{recovered from the}} bottom of Lake Nemi around 1930). The ships were among the largest vessels in the ancient world. The smaller ship was designed as a temple dedicated to Diana. The larger ship was essentially an elaborate floating palace with marble floors and plumbing. Thirteen years after being raised, the ships were burned during an attack in the Second World War, and <b>almost</b> <b>nothing</b> remains of their hulls, though many archaeological treasures remain intact in the museum at Lake Nemi and in the Museo Nazionale Romano (Palazzo Massimo) at Rome.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} aspects of the Roman world, chariot racing {{continued}} in the Byzantine Empire, although the Byzantines did not keep as many records and statistics as the Romans did. In place of the detailed inscriptions of Roman racing statistics, several short epigrams in verse were composed celebrating some of the more famous Byzantine Charioteers. The six charioteers about whom these laudatory verses were written were Anastasius, Julianus of Tyre, Faustinus, his son, Constantinus, Uranius, and Porphyrius. Although Anastasius's single epigram reveals <b>almost</b> <b>nothing</b> about him, Porphyrius is much better known, having thirty-four known poems dedicated to him.|$|E

5|$|Pseudoryzomys simplex, {{also known}} as the Brazilian false rice rat or false oryzomys, is a species of rodent in the family Cricetidae from south-central South America. It is found in lowland palm savanna and thorn scrub habitats. It is a {{medium-sized}} species, weighing about , with gray–brown fur, long and narrow hindfeet, and a tail that is about as long as the head and body. The IUCN has assessed its conservation status as being of least concern, although <b>almost</b> <b>nothing</b> is known of its diet or reproduction.|$|E
5|$|Station to Station is {{the tenth}} studio album by English {{musician}} David Bowie, released by RCA Records in 1976. Commonly {{regarded as one}} of his most significant works, Station to Station was the vehicle for his performance persona, the Thin White Duke. The album was recorded after he completed shooting Nicolas Roeg's The Man Who Fell to Earth, and the cover artwork featured a still from the movie. During the sessions Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs, especially cocaine, and later claimed that he recalled <b>almost</b> <b>nothing</b> of the production.|$|E
5|$|Adult and {{juvenile}} finetooth sharks form large schools. This energetic, fast-moving predator feeds mainly on small bony fishes, often entering the surf zone {{during the day}} to hunt. The most important prey of this species in the northwestern Atlantic is the Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), with sharks of all ages off northwestern Florida eat <b>almost</b> <b>nothing</b> else. The menhaden are swallowed whole after the head has been removed. Other known prey species include spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus), mullet (Mugil spp.), shrimp, and in one case a juvenile Atlantic sharpnose shark (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae), {{which may have been}} scavenged from the bycatch discard of a shrimp trawler. The finetooth shark may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Parasites documented from this species include the tapeworm Triloculatum geeceearelensis, and unidentified species in the genera Anthobothrium, Paraorygmatobothrium, and Phoreiobothrium.|$|E

50|$|After {{he married}} Cornelia Boschman in 1658, {{the number of}} works {{produced}} by him declined <b>almost</b> to <b>nothing.</b> This may have been because his wife was a very religious woman and a not very big patron of the arts. It could also be that he became more active in the church under his wife's guidance. He was also active as deacon and elder of the Reformed Church.|$|R

Huddled up in my towel, I sat motionless, shrunken for a while <b>almost</b> to <b>nothing</b> in the dense sense of shame that had swept over me. Then suddenly I flung myself on my knees, and prayed--though what about and to whom I cannot say. After which I went back and bathed myself again.|$|R
5|$|<b>Almost</b> <b>nothing</b> {{is known}} about Raynald's life while he was kept in jail for fifteen years. He shared his prison with Joscelin III of Courtenay, who had been {{captured}} {{a couple of months}} before. In Raynald's absence, Constance wanted to rule alone, but BaldwinIII of Jerusalem made Patriarch Aimery regent for her fifteen-year-old son (Raynald's stepson), Bohemond III of Antioch. Constance died around 1163, shortly after her son reached the age of majority. Her death deprived Raynald of his claim to Antioch. However, he had become an important personality, with prominent family connections. His stepdaughter, Maria of Antioch, married ManuelI Komnenos in 1161. Raynald's own daughter, Agnes, became the wife of Béla III of Hungary.|$|E
5|$|<b>Almost</b> <b>nothing</b> {{is known}} about the {{behaviour}} of Newton's parakeet, but it is probable that it was similar to that of other members of its genus. Leguat mentioned that the parrots of the island ate the nuts of the bois d'olive tree (Cassine orientalis). Tafforet also stated that the parrots ate the seeds of the bois de buis shrub (Fernelia buxifolia), which is endangered today, but was common all over Rodrigues and nearby islets during his visit. Newton's parakeet may have fed on leaves as the related echo parakeet does. The fact that it survived long after Rodrigues had been heavily deforested shows that its ecology was less vulnerable than that of, for example, the Rodrigues parrot.|$|E
5|$|<b>Almost</b> <b>nothing</b> is {{recorded}} {{of the first}} twenty years of Egbert's reign, apart from campaigns against the Cornish in the 810s. The historian Richard Abels argues that {{the silence of the}} Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was probably intentional, concealing Egbert's purge of Beorhtric's magnates and suppression of rival royal lines. Relations between Mercian kings and their Kentish subjects were distant. Kentish ealdormen did not attend the court of King Coenwulf, who quarrelled with Archbishop Wulfred of Canterbury (805–832) over the control of Kentish monasteries; Coenwulf's primary concern seems to have been {{to gain access to the}} wealth of Kent. His successors Ceolwulf I (821–23) and Beornwulf (823–26) restored relations with Archbishop Wulfred, and Beornwulf appointed a sub-king of Kent, Baldred.|$|E

2500|$|From 1960 to 1980, {{trade in}} the docks {{declined}} to <b>almost</b> [...] <b>nothing.</b> There were two main reasons. First, {{the development of the}} shipping container made this type of relatively small dock inefficient, and the dock-owners were slow to embrace change. Second, the manufacturing exports which had maintained the trade through the docks dwindled and moved away from the local area. In 1980 the docks were closed and the Government took control of the land.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is often}} {{believed}} that Jourgensen and Barker were close bandmates {{and the latter}} played a huge creative role in the band. Jourgensen rebuffed these claims saying that their relationship was more like an arranged marriage and [...] "acrimonious." [...] He {{said that they were}} never friends but business partners. Since leaving Ministry, Barker has distanced himself from Jourgensen and the two <b>almost</b> have <b>nothing</b> good to say about their relationship in the band.|$|R
5|$|Along with Bork, {{the other}} most {{contentious}} Supreme Court nomination in United States {{history has been}} the one for Clarence Thomas. When the Thomas hearings began in September 1991, Kennedy pressed Thomas on his unwillingness to express an opinion about Roe v. Wade, but the nomination appeared headed for success. But when the sexual harassment charges by Anita Hill broke the following month, and the nomination battle dominated public discourse, Kennedy was hamstrung by his past reputation and the ongoing developments in the William Kennedy Smith case. He said <b>almost</b> <b>nothing</b> until {{the third day of}} the Thomas–Hill hearings, and when he did it was criticized by Hill supporters for being too little, too late.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the caps}} and the stems contain the psychoactive compounds, {{although}} the caps consistently contain more. The spores of these mushrooms {{do not contain}} psilocybin or psilocin. The total potency varies greatly between species and even between specimens of a species collected or grown from the same strain. Because most psilocybin biosynthesis occurs early {{in the formation of}} fruit bodies or sclerotia, younger, smaller mushrooms tend to have a higher concentration of the drug than larger, mature mushrooms. In general, the psilocybin content of mushrooms is quite variable (ranging from <b>almost</b> <b>nothing</b> to 1.5% of the dry weight) and depends on species, strain, growth and drying conditions, and mushroom size. Cultivated mushrooms have less variability in psilocybin content than wild mushrooms. The drug is more stable in dried than fresh mushrooms; dried mushrooms retain their potency for months or even years, while mushrooms stored fresh for four weeks contain only traces of the original psilocybin.|$|E
5|$|During the reigns of HenryIV (1399–1413) and his {{successor}} HenryV (1413–1422), Rochester Castle was in the guardianship of William, Earl of Arundel and his brother Richard. The castle was given to HenryV's widow, Catherine of Valois, in 1423 {{as part of her}} dower to support her financially. She died in 1437, at which point the castle came under the custodianship of the clerk of the King's works. Despite this, there are no records of building work during the 15thcentury and <b>almost</b> <b>nothing</b> is known about Rochester Castle between then and {{the second half of the}} 16thcentury. The decline of the castle's military significance is marked by the leasing of the surrounding ditch, beginning in 1564 at the latest. Between 1599 and 1601 stone from Rochester Castle was reused to build nearby Upnor Castle, an artillery fort.|$|E
