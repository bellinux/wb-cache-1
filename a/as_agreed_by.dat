5|$|The Greek forces were, <b>as</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>by</b> the Allied congress, {{under the}} overall command of Spartan royalty {{in the person}} of Pausanias, who was the regent for Leonidas' young son, Pleistarchus, his cousin. Diodorus tells us that the Athenian {{contingent}} was under the command of Aristides; it is probable that the other contingents also had their leaders. Herodotus tells us in several places that the Greeks held council during the prelude to the battle, implying that decisions were consensual and that Pausanias did not have the authority to issue direct orders to the other contingents. This style of leadership contributed to the way events unfolded during the battle itself. For instance, in the period immediately before the battle, Pausanias was unable to order the Athenians to join up with his forces, and thus the Greeks fought the battle completely separated from each other.|$|E

Northern Prussia remained part of the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991, and since then has been an exclave of the Russian Federation.|$|E

Officially, <b>as</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>by</b> the informal Economic and Finance Ministers Council of Verona in April 1996, {{and despite the fact}} that a number of countries have a different design for each coin, the distinctive national side for the circulation coins is the obverse and the common European side (which includes the coin value) is the reverse. This rule does not apply to the collector coins as they don't have a common side.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>by</b> all 11 conferences, {{the results}} of the 2004-07 regular seasons were {{evaluated}} to determine which conferences earned automatic qualification for the BCS games that concluded 2008-11 seasons. Three criteria were used: Rank of the highest-ranked team, rank of all conference teams, and number of teams in the top 25. The six conferences which met that standard were the AQ conferences. The 2008-11 seasons were used to determine if another conference achieved automatic qualification, or a conference that had AQ status lost it, for the BCS games that concluded the 2012 and 2013 seasons.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>by</b> the Allies at the Yalta conference Germans {{were used}} as forced labor {{as part of the}} reparations to be extracted. By 1947 it is {{estimated}} that 400,000 Germans (both civilians and POWs) were being used as forced labor by the U.S., France, the UK, and the Soviet Union. German prisoners were for example forced to clear minefields in France and the Low Countries. By December 1945 it was estimated by French authorities that 2,000 German prisoners were being killed or injured each month in accidents. In Norway the last available casualty record, from 29 August 1945, shows that by that time a total of 275 German soldiers died while clearing mines, while 392 had been injured. Death rates for the German civilians doing forced labor in the Soviet Union ranged between 19% and 39%, depending on category.|$|E

25|$|Following the war, Berihah ("escape"), an {{organization}} of former partisans and ghetto fighters was primarily responsible for smuggling Jews from Eastern Europe through Poland. In 1946 Poland was the only Eastern Bloc country to allow free Jewish Aliyah to Mandate Palestine without visas or exit permits. By contrast, Stalin forcibly brought Soviet Jews back to USSR, <b>as</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>by</b> the Allies during the Yalta Conference. The refugees {{were sent to the}} Italian ports from which they traveled to Mandatory Palestine. More than 4,500 survivors left the French port of Sète aboard President Warfield (renamed Exodus). The British turned them back to France from Haifa, and forced them ashore in Hamburg. Despite British efforts to curb the illegal immigration, during the 14 years of its operation, 110,000 Jews immigrated to Palestine. In 1945 reports of the Holocaust with its 6 million Jewish killed, caused many Jews in Palestine to turn openly against the British Mandate, and illegal immigration escalated rapidly as many Holocaust survivors joined the Aliyah.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the show}} went on air, Osbourne bet Bruce and Utsler $50,000 that Insane Clown Posse's next album {{would not even}} sell 200,000 copies—a bet that Bruce accepted. On air Osbourne {{informed}} Bruce and Utsler that Coal Chamber filed a lawsuit for breach of contract. Osbourne stated that her group was to receive $12,500 per show for a scheduled two-month package tour. Bruce reiterated that Coal Chamber's music did not appeal to Insane Clown Posse fans, and that ticket refunds decreased after Coal Chamber {{had been removed from}} the tour. Osbourne then made public the bet with Bruce about Insane Clown Posse's next album, also stating that the duo would be subsequently dropped from their distributor. In Osbourne's words, [...] "You're dead. Your career is over." [...] Bruce predicted that the group's next album would sell at least 500,000 copies; however, the bet officially stood at 200,000 copies <b>as</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>by</b> both Bruce and Osbourne backstage.|$|E
2500|$|The Troubles {{were brought}} to an uneasy end by a peace process which {{included}} the declaration of ceasefires by most paramilitary organisations and the complete decommissioning of their weapons, the reform of the police, and the corresponding withdrawal of army troops from the streets and from sensitive border areas such as South Armagh and Fermanagh, <b>as</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>by</b> the signatories to the Belfast Agreement (commonly known as the [...] "Good Friday Agreement"). This reiterated the long-held British position, which {{had never before been}} fully acknowledged by successive Irish governments, that Northern Ireland will remain within the United Kingdom until a majority of voters in Northern Ireland decides otherwise. The Constitution of Ireland was amended in 1999 to remove a claim of the [...] "Irish nation" [...] to sovereignty over the entire island (in Article 2), a claim qualified by an acknowledgement that Ireland could only exercise legal control over the territory formerly known as the Irish Free State.|$|E

2500|$|<b>As</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>by</b> the Allies in Yalta, the Soviet Union {{incorporated}} the lands in eastern Poland (Kresy, {{east of the}} Curzon Line), previously occupied and annexed in 1939 (see Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union). Deferring to Stalin's territorial schemes, the Allies compensated Poland with the German territories east of the Oder–Neisse line, parts of [...] Pomerania, Silesia and East Prussia (in Polish communist government's propaganda {{referred to as the}} Recovered Territories). The deal was practically, but in principle not permanently, finalized at the Potsdam Conference (17 July to 2 August 1945). The entire country was shifted to the west and resembled the territory of Medieval early Piast Poland. Per the Potsdam agreement, several million Germans were expelled and forced to relocate their families to the new Germany. A large proportion of them had already fled not waiting for the Potsdam decrees. Davies wrote that the resettlement of Germans was not merely an act of wartime revenge, but a result of decades old Allied policy. The Russians as well as the British saw the German East Prussia as a product of German militarism, the [...] "root of Europe's miseries", and the Allies therefore intended to eradicate it.|$|E
2500|$|Writers such as Nikolay Afanásiev and Alexander Schmemann {{have written}} that the phrase [...] "presiding in agape", used of the Church of Rome {{in the letter}} that Ignatius of Antioch {{addressed}} {{to it in the}} early 2nd century, contains a definition of that Church's universal primacy; but the Roman Catholic writer Klaus Schatz warns that {{it would be wrong to}} read, as statements of the developed Roman Catholic teaching on papal primacy, this letter and the even earlier First Epistle of Clement (the name of Clement was added only later), in which the Church of Rome intervenes in matters of the Church of Corinth, admonishing it in authoritative tones, even speaking in the name of God. It was only later that the expression of Ignatius of Antioch could be interpreted as meaning, <b>as</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>by</b> representatives of both the Roman Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox Churches, that [...] "Rome, as the Church that 'presides in love' according to the phrase of St Ignatius of Antioch (To the Romans, Prologue), occupied the first place in the taxis, and that the bishop of Rome was therefore the protos among the patriarchs".|$|E
2500|$|With so many Canadians {{serving in}} RAF squadrons, Edwards was {{concerned}} that Article XV was not being implemented <b>as</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>by</b> the signatories to the BCATP. Moreover, {{the large number of}} Canadians embedded in RAF squadrons obfuscated the RCAF's contribution to the air war and Canada was not being justly recognized for its contribution. Edwards met with his RAF counterparts to revitalize Article XV, a process that became known as [...] "Canadianization", where Canadians would form distinct RCAF squadrons, which would fight as Canadian units under Canadian command. This plan received harsh criticism from the highest ranks of the RAF; his assertiveness made him unpopular around the Air Ministry. Conflicting direction from Ottawa urging him to press for [...] "Canadianization" [...] but not to antagonize the Air Ministry took a toll on his health. Eighteen RCAF fighter squadrons, organized into six Canadian wings, formed the largest Commonwealth contingent in the RAF's Second Tactical Air Force. Similarly, 15 bomber squadrons in No. 6 Group RCAF in RAF Bomber Command earned recognition of Canada's major role in carrying the fight to the enemy in the night skies over Nazi occupied Europe. In the same vein, six RCAF anti-submarine and anti-shipping squadrons provided yeoman service in RAF Coastal Command. By the end of the Second World War, RCAF BCATP establishments and squadrons in Europe constituted the fourth largest Allied air force.|$|E
