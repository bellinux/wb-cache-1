Thus, they anticipated the later work of Claude Shannon, who showed how the theoretical information rate of a channel {{is related to the}} noise of the channel.|$|E
5|$|Jerry {{knows what}} the {{situation}} is. I think he's done very well for us, considering we plucked him out of non-league football at Yeovil. But he is aware that I {{have been looking for}} a right-back and I will continue looking for one. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. When I put him in the first team, he never lets me down. I value Jerry's professionalism and for as long as I remain manager of Birmingham, there will <b>always</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> place for him here.|$|E

The fight starts and {{it is obvious that}} Homer cannot {{withstand}} Tatum's barrage and is in danger of being knocked out. Homer decides to fight back, but misses completely. As Tatum readies himself to deliver the final blow, Moe flies in using the Fan Man's paramotor and carries Homer away. Outside the arena, Marge thanks Moe for saving Homer and Tatum shows respect for the love Moe showed for Homer. Sweet declares that Moe will <b>always</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> loser, but still gives him a check for $100,000. Moe starts up the paramotor and flies off into the night.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{stated purpose}} of GRCs was {{to guarantee a}} minimum representation of minorities in Parliament and ensure that there would <b>always</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> multiracial Parliament instead of one {{made up of a}} single race. Speaking in Parliament during the debate on whether GRCs should be introduced, First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Goh Chok Tong said he had first discussed the necessity of ensuring the multiracial nature of Parliament with Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in July 1982. Then, Lee had expressed concern about the voting patterns of younger Singaporeans, who appeared to be apathetic to the need of having a racially balanced slate of candidates. He was also worried about more Singaporeans voting along racial lines, which would lead to a lack of minority representation in Parliament.|$|E

25|$|A rigid {{motion of}} the {{framework}} is a motion such that, at each point in time, the framework is congruent to its original configuration. Rigid motions include translations and rotations of Euclidean space; the gradients of rigid motions form a linear space having the translations and rotations as bases, of dimension , which must <b>always</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> subspace of the nullspace of the rigidity matrix.|$|E

25|$|Ricoeur also {{invoked the}} notion of distanciation when {{interpreting}} and understanding others. For Ricoeur, distanciation is two-fold: a) humans always interpret from a distanced position via their physical and experiential proximity to the experiences being discussed (i.e., they were not always there when it happened), and b) there will <b>always</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> distance between their experiences and their interpreted truths and meaning of those experiences. While imagination enables hermeneutic therapists to understand their clients and empathize with their experiences, there will <b>always</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> distance between what the therapist imagines and the actual embodied experience of the client. Ironically, it is this concept of distanciation that invokes the therapist's responsibility to make the attempt, to get as close as is possible, because without breaching that surface, truth and meaning are limited in their co-creation. Hermeneutic counseling theory states that a therapist and a client cannot work together to co-create meaning without empathically envisioning and understanding one another.|$|E

The Brahma Kumaris believe that modern civilization is unsustainable and that economic and environmental pressures will ultimately boil over into civil and global conflict, coupled with natural calamities. They believe that there will <b>always</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> human population on Earth and that cataclysmic events form part of a natural and cathartic cyclic process.|$|E
25|$|An ADS {{generally}} has blue, green or white as its background colour {{to indicate the}} status of road (motorway, primary or non-primary) on which it is placed. Except on the main carriageway of a motorway, coloured panels are used to indicate routes from the junction being signed that have a different status. A DS should <b>always</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> single colour indicating {{the status of the}} road to be joined, although there are a few rare exceptions to this rule.|$|E
25|$|With the {{transition}} from English law, which had common law crimes, to the new legal system under the U.S. Constitution, which prohibited ex post facto laws at both {{the federal and state}} level, the question was raised whether there could be common law crimes in the United States. It was settled in the case of United States v. Hudson , which decided that federal courts had no jurisdiction to define new common law crimes, and that there must <b>always</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> (constitutional) statute defining the offense and the penalty for it.|$|E

25|$|Auditory hallucinations, {{particularly}} {{experiences of}} hearing voices, {{are the most}} common and often prominent feature of psychosis. Hallucinated voices may talk about, or to, the person, and may involve several speakers with distinct personalities. Auditory hallucinations tend to be particularly distressing when they are derogatory, commanding or preoccupying. However, the experience of hearing voices need not <b>always</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> negative one. One research study has shown that the majority of people who hear voices are not in need of psychiatric help. The Hearing Voices Movement has subsequently been created to support voice hearers, regardless of whether they are considered to have a mental disorder or not.|$|E
25|$|Jean-Baptiste Say was a French {{economist}} who introduced Smith's economic theories into France and whose commentaries on Smith were read in both France and Britain. Say challenged Smith's labour theory of value, believing that prices {{were determined by}} utility and also emphasised the critical role of the entrepreneur in the economy. However, neither of those observations became accepted by British economists at the time. His most important contribution to economic thinking was Say's law, which was interpreted by classical economists {{that there could be}} no overproduction in a market and that there would <b>always</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> balance between supply and demand. This general belief influenced government policies until the 1930s. Following this law, since the economic cycle was seen as self-correcting, government did not intervene during periods of economic hardship because it was seen as futile.|$|E
25|$|The {{juxtaposition}} {{of the various}} types of geosynthetics just described with the primary function that the material is called upon to serve allows for the creation of an organizational matrix for geosynthetics; see table below. In essence, this matrix is the “scorecard” for understanding the entire geosynthetic field and its design related methodology. In the table the primary function that each geosynthetic can be called upon to serve is seen. Note that these are primary functions and in many cases (if not most) cases there are secondary functions, and perhaps tertiary ones as well. For example, a geotextile placed on soft soil will usually be designed {{on the basis of its}} reinforcement capability, but separation and filtration might certainly be secondary and tertiary considerations. As another example, a geomembrane is obviously used for its containment capability, but separation will <b>always</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> secondary function.|$|E
