40|$|This article prospectively {{explores the}} effects of {{collective}} team work engagement and organizational constraints <b>during</b> military <b>deployment</b> on individual-level psychological outcomes afterwards. Participants were 971 Dutch peacekeepers within 93 teams who were deployed {{between the end of}} 2008 and beginning of 2010, for an average of 4 months, in the International Security Assistance Force. Surveys were administered 2 months into deployment and 6 months afterwards. Multi-level regression analyses demonstrated that team work engagement <b>during</b> <b>deployment</b> moderated the relation between organizational constraints and post-deployment fatigue symptoms. Team members reported less fatigue symptoms after deployment if they were part of highly engaged teams <b>during</b> <b>deployment,</b> particularly when concerns about organizational constraints <b>during</b> <b>deployment</b> were high. In contrast, low team work engagement was related to more fatigue symptoms, particularly when concerns about organizational constraints were high. Contrary to expectations, no effects for team work engagement or organizational constraints were found for post-traumatic growth. The present study highlights that investing in team work engagement is important for those working in highly demanding jobs. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

30|$|Although contextualization and recontextualization {{share many}} {{similarities}} {{in that they}} help adapt services to running in the cloud, they do however differ in one fundamental way.

40|$|Abstract. In many machine {{learning}} applications {{the quality of}} features <b>during</b> <b>deployment</b> is worse than during training, as more effort and care is usually invested {{for the purpose of}} training a good model. In this paper, we consider the situation when this degradation (or noise) depends on a context whose value can be known <b>during</b> <b>deployment.</b> In this case, we can anticipate how a model will behave <b>during</b> <b>deployment</b> for different noise contexts. We introduce context plots for this, with the error on the y-axis and the level of noise on the x-axis. From these plots we can determine the dominance regions for a set of models and discard those models that are not optimal for any noise context. We perform some experiments on several classification and regression problems that show that the dominance regions can be well identified, leading to better decisions than those if the best model (without noise) is used...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} {{positive and negative}} consequences of peacekeeping operations, help-seeking behaviour among peacekeepers, PTSD prevalence rates and factors associated with PTSD symptoms. A sample of 3, 481 peacekeeping soldiers who participated in various peacekeeping operations was investigated on average 6 years following their deployment. The prevalence of PTSD was 5. 6 % overall, with 8. 0 % among peacekeepers of the former Yugoslavia and 3. 7 % among peacekeepers who went to Cambodia. Twelve percent received professional help <b>during</b> <b>deployment.</b> The majority reported positive consequences of the deployment as well (e. g., a broadening of their horizon [82 %], increased self-confidence [52 %]). The following variables {{were significantly associated with}} current PTSD symptoms: lower level of education, being single, more traumatic situations <b>during</b> <b>deployment,</b> feeling more powerless and threatened, the idea that the mission had become meaningless, having had no control over the situation, and the use of professional help <b>during</b> <b>deployment.</b> (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the importance of 2 resilience resources for service members’ {{ability to deal with}} threat <b>during</b> <b>deployment.</b> Military self-efficacy and family support were measured before deployment and related to work engagement and burnout levels of service members <b>during</b> <b>deployment.</b> We hypothesized that in high threat situations, low self-efficacy would lead to unfavorable outcomes, whereas in low threat situations, high self-efficacy could have negative consequences. In addition, we hypothesized that family support would compensate for both effects. The results showed these expected 3 -way interactions. We found that strong self-efficacy helped service members deal with exposure to threatening situations <b>during</b> <b>deployment,</b> leading to more work engagement and less burnout. However, having strong self-efficacy without being exposed to threat <b>during</b> <b>deployment</b> reduced service members’ work engagement and increased burnout. In addition, we found that the presence of family support compensated for these effects. Service members with low self-efficacy benefitted from family support when threat exposure was high, whereas service members with high self-efficacy benefitted from family support when threat exposure was low. As such, family support seemed to act as a compensatory mechanism for the potential negative effects of self-efficacy. This underlines the importance of studying the interplay between resources that help service members deal with deployment experiences. Practical implications relate to supporting service members’ resilience through enhancing multiple resources...|$|R

However, little research has examined the combined effects of Army spouses’ opinions and perceptions regarding their {{sense of community and}} support resources available <b>during</b> multiple <b>deployments.</b> This quantitative study, based on the family stress theory, recorded the opinions of 174 Army Spouses using the Army Spouses’ Perception Survey and the Sense of Community Index 2.

The criterion variable was Army spouses ’perception of support resources <b>during</b> multiple <b>deployments.</b> Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple hierarchical regressions. Analysis revealed a significant relationship between individual variables on the military and civilian sense of community index and the domain support resources applicable to assist <b>during</b> multiple <b>deployments</b> on a spouses’ perception of available support resources. The influence of Army spouses’ opinions significantly impacted how available resources were perceived and used <b>during</b> multiple <b>deployments.</b> These findings will provide empirical evidence to military and civilian leaders on Army spouses’ experiences of support resources.
