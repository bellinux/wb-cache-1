5|$|In {{the third}} book, Saving Shiloh, Marty's parents persuade Marty {{that people who}} have wronged <b>are</b> <b>worthy</b> of forgiveness. In the midst of several robberies and a murder, the {{community}} hastily faults Judd. Willing to grant Judd a second chance, Marty attempts to help him. Meanwhile, Marty and his family must face the intricacies of life such as death, hostility, and sibling rivalry.|$|E
5|$|Many young enforcers need to {{establish}} their role early in their career to avoid losing their jobs. Due to the farm systems that most professional hockey leagues use, enforcers who {{get a chance to}} play at the level above their current one (for example, an AHL player getting a chance to play in an NHL game) need to show other players, coaches, and fans that they <b>are</b> <b>worthy</b> of the enforcer role on the team. Players and coaches enjoy being with enforcers who fight for their teams, not for themselves.|$|E
5|$|To further {{understand}} {{the mysteries of}} the Foretellers and the future, the player, Chirithy, and Skuld re-enter the Foretellers' tower where they are caught by a Foreteller. They are also told that Ephemer is a traitor to his union and that he has disappeared. The player then challenges the Foreteller to a duel, assuming Ephemer has been captured, but is easily defeated. The Foreteller reveals that she is in fact Master Ava, and that the player's quest was a test of their character to see if they <b>are</b> <b>worthy</b> of leaving this world before the Great War between light and darkness. Keyblade wielders that can resist the darkness and fight for what they believe in, like their friends, <b>are</b> <b>worthy</b> of becoming elite Keyblade warriors known as Dandelions and going on to the Realm of Light and avoiding the coming universal war. All who stay will become a part of that war and must face an uncertain future. Skuld accepts the offer, but the player's character is uncertain if they should join Ephemer, who has gone on to the Realm of Light, or stay and fight to save the future. Later, they encounter two Keyblade warriors accusing each other of stealing Lux from their unions, and the player is forced to fight Master Aced, who defeats them. Ira arrives to stop the fighting. Aced claims that he is collecting more Keyblade warriors to prepare for the upcoming war before leaving. Ira informs the player, Skuld, and Chirithy that the war cannot be avoided and {{that there will be no}} victor. The only Foreteller who may have a solution is Gula so the trio go to look for him.|$|E

5|$|In the First Phase, the Cadet {{is saved}} from a Behemoth attack by Ace, who brings {{them to the}} safety of Akademeia. There they are {{introduced}} to everyday life and sent out on a mission against the Behemoth. Then war is declared against Milites after its aggressive actions against Rubrum and Lorica, and the Cadet learns of Class Zero. Concordia forms an alliance with Milites, severely hampering Rubrum's efforts. Rubrum then musters their forces, including their powerful magical warriors, and conquer all three Crystal States. In the final chapter, Rubrum's victory over the other Crystal States causes the arrival of Tempus Finis, and Miyu is made into a l'Cie and renamed Judge Myuria: her mission is to test the Cadet to see if they <b>are</b> <b>worthy</b> of becoming the Agito. The Cadet is victorious, but it is judged the Agito has not appeared and Tempus Finis consumes the world, resetting it for a new cycle of history.|$|E
5|$|Saint Augustine {{offered a}} version of divine command theory that began by casting ethics as {{the pursuit of the}} supreme good, which {{delivers}} human happiness. He argued that to achieve this happiness, humans must love objects that <b>are</b> <b>worthy</b> of human love in the correct manner; this requires humans to love God, which then allows them to correctly love that which is worthy of being loved. Augustine's ethics proposed that the act of loving God enables humans to properly orient their loves, leading to human happiness and fulfilment. Augustine supported Plato's view that a well-ordered soul is a desirable consequence of morality. However, unlike Plato, he believed that achieving a well-ordered soul had a higher purpose: living in accordance with God's commands. His view of morality was thus heteronomous, as he believed in deference to a higher authority (God), rather than acting autonomously.|$|E
5|$|The {{task of the}} order's {{advisory}} council is to evaluate the nominations of potential inductees, decide if the candidates <b>are</b> <b>worthy</b> enough to be accepted into the order, and make recommendations to the governor general, who appoints the new members. The council is chaired by the Chief Justice of Canada, and includes the Clerk of the Queen's Privy Council, the Deputy Minister of Canadian Heritage, the Chair of the Canada Council for the Arts, the President of the Royal Society of Canada, the Chair of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada, and {{five members of the}} order who sit on the council for a three-year period. If a nomination involves a non-Canadian citizen, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs is invited by the Advisory Council to offer evaluation. Decisions of the council and new appointments to and dismissals from the Order of Canada are announced through the Canada Gazette.|$|E

25|$|That {{the time}} for the {{cleansing}} of the sanctuary, synchronizing with the time of the proclamation of the third message, is a time of investigative judgment, first with reference to the dead, and at the close of probation with reference to the living, to determine who of the myriads now sleeping in the dust of the earth <b>are</b> <b>worthy</b> of a part in the first resurrection, and who of its living multitudes <b>are</b> <b>worthy</b> of translation—points which must be determined before the Lord appears.|$|E
25|$|That {{the time}} of the {{cleansing}} of the sanctuary, synchronizing with the period of the proclamation of the message of Revelation 14, is a time of investigative judgment, first, with reference to the dead, and second, with reference to the living.

60|$|For this {{is really}} to believe in God.

25|$|A direct free kick can {{be awarded}} to the {{opposing}} team if a player succeeds or attempts to kick or trip an opponent, jumps, charges or pushes an opponent, or strikes or attempts to strike an opponent. Holding, touching or spitting at an opponent are offenses that <b>are</b> <b>worthy</b> of a direct free kick, as are sliding in to play the ball while an opponent is playing it or carrying, striking or throwing the ball (except the goalkeeper). These are all accumulated fouls. The direct free kick is taken where the infringement occurred, unless it is {{awarded to the}} defending team in their penalty area, {{in which case the}} free kick may be taken from anywhere inside the penalty area. A penalty kick is awarded if a player commits one of the fouls that <b>are</b> <b>worthy</b> of a direct free kick inside their own penalty area. The position of the ball does not matter {{as long as it is}} in play but for a penalty kick, the ball must be on the outer line, perpendicular to the center of the net.|$|E
25|$|Following in the Pauline tradition, in the 5th century Augustine of Hippo viewed Christ as the {{mediator}} of the New Covenant between God and man {{and as the}} conqueror over sin. He viewed Christ as the cause and reason for the reconciliation of man with God {{after the fall of}} Adam, and he saw in Christ the path to Christian salvation. Augustine believed that salvation is available to those who <b>are</b> <b>worthy</b> of it, through faith in Christ.|$|E
25|$|Four {{important}} effects <b>are</b> <b>worthy</b> of brief mention. First, flood mitigation schemes, {{intended to}} protect infrastructure built on floodplains, have had the unintended consequence of reducing aquifer recharge associated with natural flooding. Second, prolonged depletion of groundwater in extensive aquifers can result in land subsidence, with associated infrastructure damage – as well as, third, saline intrusion. Fourth, draining acid sulphate soils, often found in low-lying coastal plains, can result in acidification and pollution of formerly freshwater and estuarine streams.|$|E

25|$|The Saginaw city {{government}} can only legally tear down blighted properties that are publicly owned, {{a number that}} stands above 400. The federal grant provides funds to demolish nearly 950 structures. After the grant's approval, Saginaw city officials announced a program to purchase unwanted, abandoned structures from property owners, which would be then {{added to the list}} of homes to tear down. Officials estimate that there are nearly 1,200 privately owned homes within the city limits that <b>are</b> <b>worthy</b> of demolition.|$|E
25|$|The {{philosophy}} of healthcare {{is the study}} of the ethics, processes, and people which constitute the maintenance of health for human beings. (Although veterinary concerns <b>are</b> <b>worthy</b> to note, the body of thought regarding their methodologies and practices is not addressed in this article.) For the most part, however, the {{philosophy of}} healthcare is best approached as an indelible component of human social structures. That is, the societal institution of healthcare {{can be seen as a}} necessary phenomenon of human civilization whereby an individual continually seeks to improve, mend, and alter the overall nature and quality of their life. This perennial concern is especially prominent in modern political liberalism, wherein health has been understood as the foundational good necessary for public life.|$|E
25|$|Haneef's legal {{advisers}} {{have challenged}} the Government {{to release the}} full record of the second police interview since they believe the public is entitled to judge for themselves whether the explanations given by Haneef in relation to these conversations <b>are</b> <b>worthy</b> of suspicion. His legal advisers have {{also pointed out that}} the material referred to by the Minister was available to the magistrate when she made her bail decision on 16 July and to the Director of Public Prosecutions when he decided to drop charges on 27 July. The Minister claims that these prior tests of the material are not relevant to his decision since, by the terms of the Act, he is not required to prove his suspicions beyond reasonable doubt. The Act also specifically exempts the Minister from the requirement to ensure his decisions comply with the principles of natural justice.|$|E
