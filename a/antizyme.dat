50|$|<b>Antizyme</b> RNA frameshifting {{stimulation}} {{element is}} a structural element which {{is found in}} <b>antizyme</b> mRNA and is known to promote frameshifting. <b>Antizyme</b> genes have two partially overlapping open reading frames, the second, which encodes the functional (<b>antizyme)</b> protein requires +1 translational frameshifting. This frameshift is stimulated by a pseudoknot present 3' of the frameshift site in the <b>antizyme</b> mRNA. The frameshifting efficiency {{is dependent on the}} concentration of polyamines in the cell, when the polyamine concentration is high frameshifting is more likely to occur which leads to an increase in the quantity of functional <b>antizyme</b> produced. The functional <b>antizyme</b> acts to reduce ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity which leads to a drop in polyamines present in the cell. Therefore, this family {{can be thought of as}} a biosensor for intracellular free polyamines that functions via a negative feedback loop.|$|E

Nevertheless, regulatory mechanisms explaining polyamine biosynthetic genes displaying dysregulated expression in suicide completers, including ornithine decarboxylase <b>antizymes</b> 1 and 2 (OAZ 1 and OAZ 2), S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AMD 1), and arginase 2 (ARG 2), have yet to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated methylation patterns in the promoter region of OAZ 1, OAZ 2, AMD 1, and ARG 2 in Brodmann area 44 from a group of 33 suicide completers and 31 non-suicide controls. We found significant site-specific differences in methylation in the promoter of ARG 2 and AMD 1 that were also significantly negatively correlated with gene expression.

40|$|Polyamines {{are known}} to play {{important}} roles in the proliferation and differentiation of many types of cells. Although considerable amounts of polyamines are synthesized and stored in the testes, their roles remain unknown. Ornithine decarboxylase <b>antizymes</b> (OAZs) control the intracellular concentration of polyamines in a feedback manner. OAZ 1 and OAZ 2 are expressed ubiquitously, whereas OAZ-t/OAZ 3 is expressed specifically in germline cells during spermiogenesis. OAZ-t reportedly binds to ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and inactivates ODC activity. In a prior study, polyamines were capable of inducing a frameshift at the frameshift sequence of OAZ-t mRNA, resulting in the translation of OAZ-t. To investigate the physiological role of OAZ-t, we generated OAZ-t-disrupted mutant mice. Homozygous OAZ-t mutant males were infertile, although the polyamine concentrations of epididymides and testes were normal in these mice, and females were fertile. Sperm were successfully recovered from the epididymides of the mutant mice, but the heads and tails of the sperm cells were easily separated in culture medium during incubation. Results indicated that OAZ-t {{is essential for the}} formation of a rigid junction between the head and tail during spermatogenesis. The detached tails and heads were alive, and most of the headless tails showed straight forward movement. Although the tailless sperm failed to acrosome-react, the heads were capable of fertilizing eggs via intracytoplasmic sperm injection.

40|$|Abstract Background Clock family genes encode {{transcription}} {{factors that}} regulate clock-controlled genes and thus regulate many physiological mechanisms/processes in a circadian fashion. Clock 1 duplicates and copies of Clock 3 and NPAS 2 -like genes were partially characterized (genomic sequencing) and mapped using family-based indels/SNPs in rainbow trout (RT) (Oncorhynchus mykiss), Arctic charr (AC) (Salvelinus alpinus), and Atlantic salmon (AS) (Salmo salar) mapping panels. Results Clock 1 duplicates mapped to linkage groups RT- 8 /- 24, AC- 16 /- 13 and AS- 2 /- 18. Clock 3 /NPAS 2 -like genes mapped to RT- 9 /- 20, AC- 20 /- 43, and AS- 5. Most of these linkage group regions containing the Clock gene duplicates {{were derived from}} the most recent 4 R whole genome duplication event specific to the salmonids. These linkage groups contain quantitative trait loci (QTL) for life history and growth traits (i. e., reproduction and cell cycling). Comparative synteny analyses with other model teleost species reveal {{a high degree of}} conservation for genes in these chromosomal regions suggesting that functionally related or co-regulated genes are clustered in syntenic blocks. For example, anti-müllerian hormone (amh), regulating sexual maturation, and ornithine decarboxylase <b>antizymes</b> (oaz 1 and oaz 2), regulating cell cycling, are contained within these syntenic blocks. Conclusions Synteny analyses indicate that regions homologous to major life-history QTL regions in salmonids contain many candidate genes that are likely to influence reproduction and cell cycling. The order of these genes is highly conserved across the vertebrate species examined, and as such, these genes may make up a functional cluster of genes that are likely co-regulated. CLOCK, as a transcription factor, is found within this block and therefore has the potential to cis-regulate the processes influenced by these genes. Additionally, clock-controlled genes (CCGs) are located in other life-history QTL regions within salmonids suggesting that at least in part, trans-regulation of these QTL regions may also occur via Clock expression. </p...|$|R

40|$|ODC (ornithine decarboxylase) is the {{rate-limiting enzyme}} in {{polyamine}} biosynthesis. Polyamines {{are essential for}} cellular growth and differentiation but enhanced ODC activity is associated with cell transformation. Post-translationally, ODC is negatively regulated through members of the <b>antizyme</b> family.

Besides the ubiquitously expressed antizymes 1 and 2, there is the tissue-specific <b>antizyme</b> 3 and an yet uncharacterized <b>antizyme</b> 4. <b>Antizyme</b> 1 {{has been shown to}} be negatively regulated through the AZI (<b>antizyme</b> inhibitor) that binds <b>antizyme</b> 1 with higher affinity compared with ODC. In the present study, we show by yeast two- and three-hybrid protein–protein interaction studies that AZI interacts with all members of the <b>antizyme</b> family and is capable of disrupting the interaction between each <b>antizyme</b> and ODC. In a yeast-based ODC complementation assay, we show that human ODC is able to complement fully the function of the yeast homologue of ODC.

In summary, we conclude that human AZI is capable of acting as a general inhibitor for all members of the <b>antizyme</b> family and that the previously not yet characterized <b>antizyme</b> 4 is capable of binding ODC and inhibiting its enzymic activity similar to the other members of the <b>antizyme</b> family...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This review {{considers}} {{the role of}} bacterial <b>antizyme</b> in the regulation of polyamine biosynthesis and gives new perspectives on the involvement of <b>antizyme</b> in other significant cellular mechanisms. <b>Antizyme</b> is a protein molecule induced by the end product of the enzymic reaction that it inhibits, in a non-competitive manner. The bacterial ornithine decarboxylase is regulated by nucleotides, phosphorylation and <b>antizyme.</b> The inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase by <b>antizyme</b> can be relieved to different degrees by DNA or {{by a variety of}} synthetic nucleic acid polymers, attributed to a specific interaction between nucleic acid and <b>antizyme.</b> Recently, this interplay between bacterial <b>antizyme</b> and nucleic acid was determined by discerning an additional function to <b>antizyme</b> that proved to be the atoC gene product, encoding the response regulator of the bacterial two-component system AtoS-AtoC. The gene located just upstream of atoC encodes the sensor kinase, named AtoS, that modulates AtoC activity. AtoC regulates expression of atoDAEB operon which is involved in short-chain fatty acid metabolism. <b>Antizyme</b> is thus referred to as AtoC, functioning both as a post-translational and transcriptional regulator. Also, the AtoS-AtoC signal transduction system in E. coli has a positive regulatory role on poly-(R) - 3 -hydroxybutyrate biosynthesis. The properties and gene structural similarities of antizymes from different organisms were compared. It was revealed that conserved domains are present mostly in the C-domain of all antizymes.

40|$|Abstract Background Ornithine decarboxylase antizymes are {{proteins}} which negatively regulate cellular polyamine levels via their affects on polyamine synthesis {{and cellular}} uptake. In virtually all organisms from yeast to mammals, antizymes are encoded by two partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). A + 1 frameshift between frames {{is required for}} the synthesis of <b>antizyme.</b> Ribosomes change translation phase {{at the end of the}} first ORF in response to stimulatory signals embedded in mRNA. Since standard sequence analysis pipelines are currently unable to recognise sites of programmed ribosomal frameshifting, proper detection of full length <b>antizyme</b> coding sequences (CDS) requires conscientious manual evaluation by a human expert. The rapid growth of sequence information demands less laborious and more cost efficient solutions for this problem. This manuscript describes a rapid and accurate computer tool for <b>antizyme</b> CDS detection that requires minimal human involvement. Results We have developed a computer tool, OAF (ODC <b>antizyme</b> finder) for identifying <b>antizyme</b> encoding sequences in spliced or intronless nucleic acid sequenes. OAF utilizes a combination of profile hidden Markov models (HMM) built separately for the products of each open reading frame constituting the entire <b>antizyme</b> coding sequence. Profile HMMs are based on a set of 218 manually assembled <b>antizyme</b> sequences. To distinguish between <b>antizyme</b> paralogs and orthologs from major phyla, <b>antizyme</b> sequences were clustered into twelve groups and specific combinations of profile HMMs were designed for each group. OAF has been tested on the current version of dbEST, where it identified over six thousand Expressed Sequence Tags (EST) sequences encoding <b>antizyme</b> proteins (over two thousand <b>antizyme</b> CDS in these ESTs are non redundant). Conclusion OAF performs well on raw EST sequences and mRNA sequences derived from genomic annotations. OAF will be used for the future updates of the RECODE database.

The components of the polyamine feedback regulation system have been examined in an attempt to understand these unusual responses. Southern-blot analysis revealed an amplification (approx. 10 -fold) in ODC DNA sequence without any concomitant increase in <b>antizyme.</b> Moreover, the amplified ODC sequence contains a single base substitution that results in the conversion of Cys- 441 into Trp. This modification has previously been shown to cause ODC stability in HMOA cells. Although <b>antizyme</b> activity has not been noted in DH 23 b cells, Western-blot analysis revealed the accumulation of <b>antizyme</b> protein to > 50 times that induced in parental HTC cells.

40|$|The {{induction}} of <b>antizyme</b> by spermidine and {{the resulting}} enhancement of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) degradation have been well studied; however, {{little is known about}} the mechanism whereby elevated spermidine levels decrease synthesis of the polyamine biosynthetic enzyme. To evaluate the relative contribution of inhibited synthesis, as distinct from enhanced degradation of ODC, spermidine levels were manipulated in a variant cell line that overproduces a stable form of ODC. Spermidine did not selectively inhibit ODC synthesis in these variant cells, supporting the concept that spermidine diminishes ODC synthesis in normal cells owing to enhanced degradation of the protein in the presence of elevated <b>antizyme</b> levels. This model was further investigated in vitro by use of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, which catalyses simultaneous ODC mRNA translation and antizyme-stimulated degradation of ODC protein. <b>Antizyme</b> strongly repressed the incorporation of labelled amino acids into normal rat ODC.

As shown here, the yeast <b>antizyme</b> gene and several newly identified <b>antizyme</b> genes from different nematodes also require a ribosomal frameshift event for their expression. Twelve nucleotides around the frameshift site are identical between S. pombe and the mammalian counterparts. The core element for this frameshifting {{is likely to have}} been present in the last common ancestor of yeast, nematodes and mammals...|$|E
40|$|Previously, a Drosophila melanogaster {{sequence}} {{with high}} homology to the sequence for mammalian <b>antizyme</b> (ornithine decarboxylase <b>antizyme)</b> was reported. The present {{study shows that}} homology of this coding sequence to its mammalian <b>antizyme</b> counterpart also extends to a 5 ′ open reading frame (ORF) which encodes the amino-terminal part of <b>antizyme</b> and overlaps the + 1 frame (ORF 2) that encodes the carboxy-terminal three-quarters of the protein. Ribosomes shift frame from the 5 ′ ORF to ORF 2 with an efficiency regulated by polyamines. At least in mammals, {{this is part of}} an autoregulatory circuit. The shift site and 23 of 25 of the flanking nucleotides which are likely important for efficient frameshifting are identical to their mammalian homologs. In the reverse orientation, within one of the introns of the Drosophila <b>antizyme</b> gene, the gene for snRNP Sm D 3 is located. Previously, it was shown that two closely linked P-element transposon insertions caused the gutfeeling phenotype of embryonic lethality and aberrant neuronal and muscle cell differentiation. The present work shows that defects in either snRNP Sm D 3 or <b>antizyme,</b> or both, are likely causes of the phenotype...|$|E
40|$|Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) {{degradation}} in {{a freshly}} prepared reticulocyte lysate was examined. Immunodepletion of proteasomes from the reticulocyte lysate resulted in almost complete loss of ODC degradation. In {{contrast with the}} previously reported degradation in extracts of hepatoma tissue-culture (HTC) and Chinese-hamster ovary (CHO) cells or that by the purified 26 S proteasome, efficient degradation of ODC was observed in the lysate without exogenous <b>antizyme,</b> an ODC protein inhibitor induced by polyamines, owing {{to the presence of}} a significant amount of <b>antizyme</b> in the lysate. The degradation of ODC in the lysate was strongly suppressed on inactivation of <b>antizyme</b> in the lysate with <b>antizyme</b> inhibitor, a protein which binds to the <b>antizyme</b> and releases ODC from the ODC-antizyme complex. Thus the main pathway for ODC degradation in a reticulocyte lysate was essentially the same as that characterized previously in extracts of HTC and CHO cells, namely an ATP- and antizyme-dependent 26 S proteasome-catalysed pathway that is presumed to be responsible for ODC degradation in whole cells...|$|E
40|$|Exposure of {{ornithine}} decarboxylase (ODC; L-ornithine carboxy-lyase, EC 4. 1. 1. 17) -overproducing mouse FM 3 A cells to micromolar levels of spermine or spermidine caused abnormal accumulation and toxicity of polyamines. This was apparently {{due to the}} inefficiency of negative feedback control of polyamine transport by polyamines in ODC-overproducing cells. Since <b>antizyme</b> is the only protein thus far recognized that can interact with ODC, depletion of free <b>antizyme</b> was regarded {{as the reason for}} the abnormal accumulation of polyamines. Accordingly, ODC-overproducing cells were transfected with pMAMneoZ 1 possessing rat <b>antizyme</b> cDNA under the control of a glucocorticoid-inducible promoter. In the transfected cells, the addition of dexamethasone caused an increase in the amount of <b>antizyme</b> with an apparent molecular mass of 27 kDa, a decrease in the amount of ODC, a decrease in the polyamine transport activity, and the recovery of growth inhibition or cell death. The results indicate that <b>antizyme</b> can regulate not only the amount of ODC but also the activity of polyamine transport...|$|E
