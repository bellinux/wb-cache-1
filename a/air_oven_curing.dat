40|$|Abstract- The {{potential}} use of Steel Fiber Reinforced Concrete (SFRC) is {{to improve}} the structural strength and reduce steel reinforcements requirements. Here blast furnace slag (GGBS) {{has been used as a}} supplementary material along with the cement. It helps in increasing the durability and strength of the concrete. This study mainly deals with the compressive strength of high strength concrete reinforced with metallic (steel) fibres based upon different curing methods like normal curing, steam curing and hot <b>air</b> <b>oven</b> <b>curing.</b> Addition of HRWR ¶ super plasticizer as it allows the reduction of the water to cement ratio as well as production of high performance concrete. The study mainly emphasis upon the best combination of aggregates, steel fibres and also best curing methods. The investigation results suggests that the mix SF 13 having CA 40 % & Mortar 60 % with the addition of 60 mm steel fibre by 60 % and 35 mm steel fibre by 40 % has shown the maximum value in different curing methods...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{researches}} on Ultra High Strength Concrete (UHSC) {{revealed that}} it has high compressive strength and high tensile strength. It also has large ductility to develop even after cracking in cooperation with fibers. The possibility of achieving high strength, durability, and improved ductility {{with the use of}} UHSC encourages researchers and engineers to use this modern material in many construction applications. In this paper, several possibilities are examined for reducing the cement dosage of UHSC because the high amount of cement content not only affects the production costs, but also has negative effects on the environment. In this study, mechanical properties (compressive strength and split tensile strength) of UHSC produced with Class-F Fly Ash (FA) and Rice Husk Ash (RHA) were investigated under different curing conditions (normal and hot <b>air</b> <b>oven</b> <b>curing).</b> Test results showed that UHSC containing mineral admixtures have satisfactory mechanical performance. Between the replacement of FA and RHA, RHA at 20 % replacement of cement gave higher compressive and split tensile strength than the other. The results indicate that RHA and FA can be suitable for use as a supplementary cementitious material to produce UHSC. The total cement replacement percentage by this blend can go up to 20 %...|$|E

Their high {{strength to weight}} ratio has made them {{an integral part of}} numerous engineering applications. In this study biodegradable matrix is combined with areca frond fibres for developing composites for low strength structural applications. Areca frond fibres were extracted and treated with sodium bicarbonate to improve the surface characteristics. Hand lay-up and compression moulding techniques were used to fabricate composites having unidirectional fibre orientation. The specimens prepared were exposed to varied environments, namely, sunlight, OTG oven, steam <b>oven,</b> and hot <b>air</b> <b>oven,</b> for <b>curing</b> and the results were analyzed to best suit the implicated requirements. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the changes in surface characteristics of the frond fibres after treatment.

A comprehensive evaluation on the post-crack toughness properties was assessed using four-point bend test. Test results exhibited that a geopolymer concrete of maximum compressive strength of 56. 6 [*]MPa can be achieved with steam curing. Experimental observations also demonstrated that the steel fibre inclusions in geopolymer concrete provided adequate improvement on post-crack toughness properties and showed higher composite performance with increased volume fraction of steel fibres...|$|R
30|$|All {{rheological}} {{measurements were}} {{performed in a}} stress-controlled Physica Rheolab MC 1. It is a rotational rheometer based on the Searle principle. It features a DC motor drive and optical encoder which provides excellent speed regulation, dynamic range, and transient response. These features provide superior performance in comparison with rheometers using gear-driven (indirect) or stepper motor drives. It enables precise measurements of fluid viscosity over the widest range of conditions available today. This machine is not equipped with a high pressure cell, and measurement at high temperature is not allowed. Hence, the gel had to be <b>cured</b> in hot <b>air</b> <b>oven.</b> The <b>cured</b> samples were transferred to the rheometer, and tests were conducted at 30 °C. If these experiments were done at higher temperature, the viscosity of the polymer gel may have increased. Viscosity measurement tests were performed at different shear rates ranging from 1 to 1, 200 s− 1 using cone-and-plate geometry with a logarithmically increasing scale. Gelled samples {{were placed on the}} lower plate, and the upper spindle was brought slowly to the 0.2 -mm gap. The reasons why a cone-and-plate sensor configuration was chosen as a test geometry are (1) cleaning is very easy after each measurement, (2) the cone and plate can be easily covered with tissue paper, and (3) there is a relatively smaller gap error due to a larger gap size between the cone and plate (0.2 [*]mm in this experiment) compared to a cone-and-plate sensor (50 -mm diameter, 1 ° angle).|$|R

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} alkali-activated fly ash (AAFA) {{manufactured}} with thermal <b>oven</b> <b>curing</b> and pulsed microwave curing methods. Fly ash activated by 8 M NaOH solution at a liquid to solid ratio of 0. 3 was <b>cured</b> by thermal <b>oven</b> at 85 °C and domestic microwave oven, respectively. Apart from compressive strength test, the temperature profiles of AAFA samples were captured by thermal camera.

The {{results showed that}} with much shorter curing duration, the compressive strength of AAFA samples under microwave curing was comparable to those samples under thermal <b>oven</b> <b>curing.</b> The XRD results demonstrated that different reaction products were generated from thermal <b>oven</b> <b>curing</b> (hydroxysodalite) and microwave curing (chabazite-Na) respectively.

By utilizing L 9 Taguchi array, 9 series of experiments were conducted on the prepared specimens. The alkali activating was done by a mixture of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium silicate (Na 2 SiO 3) solutions.

A range of prepreg carbon fibre epoxy layups {{were subjected to}} a 10 m/s impact with 4 kJ of energy.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} fresh {{properties}} and compressive strength of high calcium alkali-activated fly ash (AAFA) mortar. Two different sources of class C fly ash, with different chemical compositions {{were used to}} prepare alkali-activated mortar mixtures. Four different sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide (SS/SH) ratios of 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5, and 2. 5 were used as alkaline activators with a constant sodium hydroxide concentration of 10  M. Two curing regimes were also applied, <b>oven</b> <b>curing</b> at 70  °C for 24  h, and ambient curing at 23  ±  2  °C. The rest time, i. e., the time between casting the mortar cubes and starting the <b>oven</b> <b>curing</b> was 2  h. The results revealed that the setting time, and workability of mortar decreased with increasing the alkali to fly ash ratio, and decreasing the water to fly ash ratio. The optimum sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide ratio was 1. 0, which showed the highest compressive strength and setting time. An increase of sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide ratio to 2. 5 led to {{a significant reduction in}} the setting time, and workability of mortar.

This paper {{provides}} a {{report about the}} results of an investigation carried out to understand the effect of Microwave Incinerated Rice Husk Ash (MIRHA) on the mechanical properties of fly ash geopolymer concrete to access the concrete performance development.

40|$|Alkali-activated fly ash (AAFA) {{has been}} {{identified}} as a low-carbon alternative to Portland cement (PC). However, conventional thermal <b>oven</b> <b>curing,</b> typically at 85 oC, is commonly required to firstly initiate and then accelerate the chemical reaction, which may result in more energy consumption, offsetting the environmental benefits which could be obtained from AAFA.

A microwave curing regime based on a control strategy using temperature feedback data was developed and evaluated in the manufacture of AAFA. The temperature profile within the AAFA sample produced under microwave curing was obtained by using an embedded optical fibre temperature sensor, which was thus used to adjust the microwave power in real-time in order to achieve a desired internal temperature.
