500|$|Desolate North {{received}} mixed reviews. The album garnered positive {{reviews from}} a number of ezines, with comparisons to founders of the genre, such as Disembowelment. AllMusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia, however, felt that Desolate North compared negatively with the efforts of more prominent bands, concluding that [...] "Celestiial could be <b>a</b> <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> worse, but they could be much better, too." [...] Scott Seward of Decibel Magazine felt that the music compared well to similar bands, said that Anderson [...] "makes beautiful sounds out of the darkness that others would rather run from".|$|E

This was a decision that Yager thought would hurt the game. Davis described the project as a [...] "waste of money" [...] and a [...] "low-quality Call of Duty clone". The president of Darkside Game Studios, Hugh Falk, responded by calling Davis' opinion [...] "outlying". He added that Darkside participated in the project {{towards the end of}} the game's development cycle and that they had to revamp the entire multiplayer system within tight deadlines. Davis later claimed that his comments were not directed at Darkside Game Studios, and that he is satisfied with their final product after a long and troubled development cycle.|$|E

Landy remembered 15 Big Ones as [...] "the only major success" [...] the Beach Boys had in recent years; [...] "Brian and I did that together. Right after that, I {{had to leave}} the situation. ... I was {{interested}} in making Brian a whole human being; they [...] were interested in getting another album done in time for 1977."
