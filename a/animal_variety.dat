6000|$|But the {{situation}} can be stated another way. There came a time, roughly somewhere about 1880, {{when the two}} great positive enthusiasms of Western Europe had for the time exhausted each other--Christianity and the French Revolution. About that time {{there used to be}} a sad and not unsympathetic jest going about to the effect that Queen Victoria might very well live longer than the Prince of Wales. Somewhat in the same way, though the republican impulse was hardly a hundred years old and the religious impulse nearly two thousand, yet as far as England was concerned, the old wave and the new seemed to be spent at the same time. On the one hand Darwin, especially through the strong journalistic genius of Huxley, had won a very wide spread though an exceedingly vague victory. I do not mean that Darwin's own doctrine was vague; his was merely one particular hypothesis about how <b>animal</b> <b>variety</b> might have arisen; and that particular hypothesis, though it will always be interesting, is now very much the reverse of secure. But it is only in the strictly scientific world and among strictly scientific men that Darwin's detailed suggestion has largely broken down. The general public impression that he had entirely proved his case (whatever it was) was early arrived at, and still remains. It was and is hazily associated with the negation of religion. But (and this is the important point) it was also associated with the negation of democracy. The same Mid-Victorian muddle-headedness that made people think that [...] "evolution" [...] meant that we need not admit the supremacy of God, also made them think that [...] "survival" [...] meant that we must admit the supremacy of men. Huxley had no hand in spreading these fallacies; he was a fair fighter; and he told his own followers, who spoke thus, most emphatically not to play the fool. He said most strongly that his or any theory of evolution left the old philosophical arguments for a creator, right or wrong, exactly where they were before. He also said most emphatically that any one who used the argument of Nature against the ideal of justice or an equal law, was as senseless as a gardener who should fight on the side of the ill weeds merely because they grew apace. I wish, indeed, that in such a rude summary as this, I had space to do justice to Huxley as a literary man and a moralist. He had a live taste and talent for the English tongue, which he devoted to the task of keeping Victorian rationalism rational. He did not succeed. As so often happens when a rather unhealthy doubt is in the atmosphere, the strongest words of their great captain could not keep the growing crowds of agnostics back from the most hopeless and inhuman extremes of destructive thought. Nonsense not yet quite dead about the folly of allowing the unfit to survive began to be more and more wildly whispered. Such helpless specimens of [...] "advanced thought" [...] are, of course, quite as inconsistent with Darwinism as they are with democracy or with any other intelligent proposition ever offered. But these unintelligent propositions were offered; and the ultimate result was this rather important one: that the harshness of Utilitarianism began to turn into downright tyranny. That beautiful faith in human nature and in freedom which had made delicate the dry air of John Stuart Mill; that robust, romantic sense of justice which had redeemed even the injustices of Macaulay--all that seemed slowly and sadly to be drying up. Under the shock of Darwinism all that was good in the Victorian rationalism shook and dissolved like dust. All that was bad in it abode and clung like clay. The magnificent emancipation evaporated; the mean calculation remained. One could still calculate in clear statistical tables, how many men lived, how many men died. One must not ask how they lived; for that is politics. One must not ask how they died; for that is religion. And religion and politics were ruled out of all the Later Victorian debating clubs; even including the debating club at Westminster. What third thing they were discussing, which was neither religion nor politics, I do not know. I have tried the experiment of reading solidly through a vast number of their records and reviews and discussions; and still I do not know. The only third thing I can think of to balance religion and politics is art; and no one well acquainted with the debates at St. Stephen's will imagine that the art of extreme eloquence was the cause of the confusion. None will maintain that our political masters are removed from us by an infinite artistic superiority in the choice of words. The politicians know nothing of politics, which is their own affair: they know nothing of religion, which is certainly not their affair: it may legitimately be said that they have to do with nothing; they have reached that low and last level where a man knows as little about his own claim, as he does about his enemies'. In any case there can be no doubt about the effect of this particular situation on the problem of ethics and science. The duty of dragging truth out by the tail or the hind leg or any other corner one can possibly get hold of, a perfectly sound duty in itself, had somehow come into collision with the older and larger duty of knowing something about the organism and ends of a creature; or, in the everyday phrase, being able to make head or tail of it. This paradox pursued and tormented the Victorians. They could not or would not see that humanity repels or welcomes the railway-train, simply according to what people come by it. They could not see that one welcomes or smashes the telephone, according to what words one hears in it. They really seem to have felt that the train could be a substitute for its own passengers; or the telephone a substitute for its own voice.|$|E

40|$|Patent law has during time {{evolved from}} {{industrial}} inventions to also include intellectual inventions. Patentability has as well changed with time. For technology to be patentable {{it must be}} considered to be a technical solution to a problem, and today genetic inventions are considered to be such a technical solution. From the beginning plants and animals were not considered as inventions; however, technology progress urged modifications of existing legislation to meet development progress within technology. European as well as international harmonization have been carried out in this field to ensure uniformity. The exclusion from patentability for plant and <b>animal</b> <b>varieties</b> can be found in several sources of law; this study focuses on the exclusions in Article 4 of Directive 98 / 44 /EC on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions, as well as in Article 53 b of the European Patent Convention. After two specific cases from the European Patent Office the scope of the exclusion from patentability for plant and <b>animal</b> <b>varieties</b> was questioned. The two cases ONCO-mouse and Plant Genetic Systems had different outcomes, patent was granted in one case and not in the other; and that raised confusion as to the definition of plant and <b>animal</b> <b>varieties,</b> as both cases concerned genetic modification. Although there is no clear definition of plant and <b>animal</b> <b>varieties,</b> case law provides guidance to a certain extent, the reasoning in the case law also gives guidance as to where the judiciary is heading in its interpretation. There is more legislation concerning plant varieties, and the definition of this term might {{be considered to be}} clearer. The general opinion seems to be that what is said about plant varieties should be applied mutatis mutandis to <b>animal</b> <b>varieties,</b> and vice versa, however this may be questionable in some cases. The lack of a clear definition of the terms plant and <b>animal</b> <b>varieties</b> might result in a lack of legal certainty in this field, as demonstrated by the questioning of the two contradicting cases mentioned above. Rapid developments in the field of biotechnology imply that the patentability of plants and animals will be assessed on other grounds in the future. As biotechnology is an expanding area, the acceptance of new controversial inventions may occur on a more regular basis. Time will tell if this is the case...|$|R

50|$|Before {{the refuge}} was established, over 140 mi of roads were {{constructed}} {{to provide access}} to the timber. These roads disrupted the swamp's natural hydrology, as the ditches which were dug to provide soil for the road beds drained water from the swamp. The roads also blocked the flow of water across the swamp's surface, flooding some areas of the swamp with stagnant water. The logging operations removed natural stands of bald cypress and Atlantic white cypress that were replaced by other forest types, particularly red maple. A drier swamp and the suppression of wildfires, which once cleared the land for seed germination, created ecological conditions that were less favorable to the survival of cypress stands. As a result, plant and <b>animal</b> <b>variety</b> decreased.|$|E

40|$|Inspite of Etythrina species exhibit morphologic {{attributes}} for {{adaptation to}} pollination by nectarivorous birds {{mentioned in the}} literature, E. speciosa is pollinated by lots of bees (Apinae and Meliponinae) which show a great urban occurrence. Systems of E. speciosa floral reproduction, fenology, diversity, frequency and constancy of insects visiting at different hours and flowering periods were studied. E. speciosa is Biocompatible, but xenogamy is the predominant system of reproduction. A large diversity of insects visiting the inflorescences was observed, with predominance of bees. The bee species showed a higher frequency: Apis mellifera Linnaeus, 1758 (45, 0 %), Trigona spinipes (Fabricius, 1793) (28, 6 %), Trigona hyalinata (Lepeletier, 1836) (12, 2 %) and the ant Zacryptoceruspusillus Klug, 1824 (2, 8 %). Constant but not frequent were the bees (Apidae) Plebeia droryana (Friese, 1900), Friesella schrottkyi (Friese, 1900), Nannotrigona testaceicornis (Lepeletier, 1836), Tetragonisca angustula (Latreille, 1811), the wasps (Vespidae) Polybia paulista Ihering, 1896, Protopolybia exigua (de Saussure, 1854), Agelaia pallipes (Olivier. 1791), the ant (Formicidae) Pseudomyrmex sp. and the beetle (Chrysomelidae) Diabrotica speciosa (Germar, 1824). E. speciosa flowers were visited by hummingbirds (Trochilidae) : Eupetomena macroura (Gmelin, 1788), Clorostilbon aureoventris (d'Orbigny & Lafresnaye, 1838) and Amazilia sp. The birds Passer domeslicus (Linnaeus, 1758) (Ploceidae) and Coereba flaveola (Linnaeus, 1758) (Emberizidac), also are present. The frequency and insect distribution were influenced by ambiental factors. Temperature, light, time, barometric pressure, relative humidity and wind velocity were significantly correlated with insect numbers. There is a visit sequence, by floral resource disponibility during the day, conditioned by transport ability, insect numbers and colony necessity, which begins by A. mellifera followed by meliponid bees. These bees make the pollination when they collect the pollen. There is a great <b>animal</b> <b>variety</b> which are sustained by flowers. It is suggested that E. speciosa is one important food source for urban fauna in winter, and so it should be utilized more frequently in streets, parks and gardens arborization...|$|E
