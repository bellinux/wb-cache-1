40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the shear bond {{strength}} and Adhesive Remnant Index of four different veneering ceramic materials to metal brackets. Additionally, it should be examined whether it is possible to overcome the etching method using hydrofluoric acid which is noxious. Instead of this treatment, <b>air</b> particle <b>abrasion</b> with 25 µm aluminium trioxide, silane coupling application and etching with 37. 0 per cent orthophosphoric acid as pre-treatment procedures of the veneering ceramics before bonding was investigated. Two surface conditioning methods of four ceramic materials before bonding brackets were examined: in group 1 an <b>air</b> particle <b>abrasion</b> with 25 µm aluminium trioxide (4 seconds at a pressure of 2. 5 bars) and subsequently a silane coupling agent (Espe Sil, 3 M Unitek, Monrovia, USA) was applicated on one side of each ceramic specimen (10 per group). In group 2 one side of each sample (10 per group) was etched with 37. 0 per cent orthophosphoric acid for two minutes and was followed by a silane application (Espe Sil, 3 M Unitek, Monrovia, USA). After this procedure the self-ligating metal brackets SmartClip (3 M Unitek, Monrovia, USA) brackets were bonded to the ceramic blocks and a thermocycling process started (5 °C - 55 °C, 6000 cycles). Then, shear bond strength and Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI) were measured. To determine statistical differences Oneway-ANOVA and Tukey Post-hoc test were performed. The level of significance was set at α = 0. 05. On the basis of the results of the current study, it could be concluded that sandblasting with 25 µm aluminium trioxide and the use of orthophosphoric acid (37. 0 per cent) seem to prepare the surface of the ceramic restoration sufficiently before bracket bonding. The found level of shear bond strength values seem be sufficient for bracket bonding.

40|$|AbstractPurposeEvaluating {{the effect}} of various fiber {{reinforced}} composite (FRC) post surface treatments on its tensile bond strength to root canal dentin. Materials and methodForty extracted human maxillary central incisors were selected. The coronal portion of each tooth was sectioned 15  mm coronally from the root apex. All root canals were instrumented, obturated and the post spaces were prepared to a depth 10 mm. The specimens were classified into four groups according to the surface treatment. Group 1 :- surface treatment with plasma (argon plasma), Group 2 :- surface treatment with <b>air</b> born- particle <b>abrasion,</b> Group 3 :- surface treatment with <b>air</b> born -particle <b>abrasion</b> and silane, Group 4 :- control group without any surface treatment. Two randomly selected posts from each group were examined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Self adhesive cement was used for cementation of all posts. Specimens were subjected to thermal cycling {{for a total of}} 5, 000  cycles between 5  °C and 55  °C, with a 30 -second dwell time, 20  sec transfer time at each temperature. The tensile bond strength test was performed using a universal testing machine at a cross-head speed 0. 5  mm/min until failure occurred. Posts were examined under stereomicroscope to detect the mode of failure. The data were collected, tabulated and statistically analyzed. ResultsThe tensile bond strength of the luting agent to the post was significantly affected by surface treatment (P <  0. 05).

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{abrasive}} wear of polymers is important both {{in the preparation of}} polymers prior to joining and in the techniques used to expose surfaces and interfaces for examination by a variety of analytical methods. In this investigation by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the influence of the atmosphere on the chemical damage to polypropylene during the process of abrasion was examined, looking in particular for evidence of surface oxidation. The extent to which particles of abrasive, alumina in the present case, are introduced into the polymer was also examined. In this case a comparison of dry and lubricated polishing was made. The latter was found to be the more damaging, with damage increasing in relation to the solubility parameter of the solvent (lubricant). The work has shown that the simple cutting of the surface by an uncontaminated knife is the cleanest method for the exposure of the internal surfaces of the polymer. No advantage is gained by shaving the surface in argon or vacuum over that produced by shaving in <b>air.</b> Dry <b>abrasion</b> using alumina is effective in removing pre-existing contamination, but significant quantities of alumina are introduced into the surface.

Silane was applied to all roughened surfaces. Metal brackets were bonded with light cure composite, then stored in distilled water for 1 week and thermocycled (× 500 at 5 – 55 °C for 30 seconds). The ceramic surfaces were examined with a stereomicroscope at a magnifi cation of × 10 to determine the amount of composite resin remaining using the adhesive remnant index.

This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} three different surface conditioning methods on the bond strength of a Bis-GMA based luting cement to six commercial dental ceramics. Methods. Six disc shaped ceramic specimens (glass ceramics, glass infiltrated alumina, glass infiltrated zirconium dioxide reinforced alumina) were used for each test group yielding a total number of 216 specimens. The specimens in each group {{were randomly assigned to}} one of the each following treatment conditions: (1) hydrofluoric acid etching, (2) airborne particle abrasion, (3) tribochemical silica coating. The resin composite luting cement was bonded to the conditioned and silanized ceramics using polyethylene molds. All specimens were tested at dry and thermocycled (6. 000, 5 – 55 8 C, 30 s) conditions. The shear bond strength of luting cement to ceramics was measured in a universal testing machine (1 mm/min). Results. In dry conditions, acid etched glass ceramics exhibited significantly higher results (26. 4 – 29. 4 MPa) than those of glass infiltrated alumina ceramics (5. 3 – 18. 1 MPa) or zirconium dioxide (8. 1 MPa) (ANOVA, P, 0 : 001). Silica coating with silanization increased the bond strength significantly for high-alumina ceramics (8. 5 – 21. 8 MPa) and glass infiltrated zirconium dioxide ceramic (17. 4 MPa) compared to that of airborne particle abrasion (ANOVA, P, 0 : 001). Thermocycling decreased the bond strengths significantly after all of the conditioning methods tested. Significance.

Reported advantages of <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> include reduced noise, vibration and sensitivity. <b>Air</b> <b>abrasion</b> cavity preparations have more rounded internal contours than those prepared with straight burs. This may increase the longevity of placed restorations because it reduces the incidence of fractures and a consequence of decreased internal stresses. However, <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> cannot be used for all patients, i. e. in cases involving severe dust allergy, asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, recent extraction or other oral surgery, open wounds, advanced periodontal disease, recent placement of orthodontic appliances and oral abrasions, or subgingival caries removal. Many of these conditions increase the risk of air embolism in the oral soft tissues. Dust control is a challenge, and it necessitates the use of rubber dam, high-volume evacuation, protective masks and safety eyewear for both the patient and the therapist.

40|$|Background and aims. Anterior {{esthetic}} restoration {{is challenging}} in pediatric dentistry, due to limited durability and poor retention of the restoration. This study assessed {{the effect of}} <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> on tensile failure load of composite class III restorations using different preparation techniques. Materials and methods. 100 extracted human anterior primary teeth were divided, based on the preparation methods, into four groups each consisting of 25 subjects : conventional (A), labial surface bevel (B), conventional + <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> (C), and labial surface bevel + <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> (D). After restoring cavities, tensile failure load of samples was measured in Newton by Universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 1 mm per minute. The data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and Mann Whitney U tests using SPSS software. Results. There were {{statistically significant differences between}} groups A and C (P = 0. 003), groups A and B (P < 0. 001), groups A and D (P < 0. 001), groups B and C (P = 0. 028), groups B and D (P = 0. 027), and also groups C and D (P < 0. 001). Group D demonstrated the highest mean tensile failure load. Conclusion. Labial surface bevel treated by <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> showed significantly more retention of composite restoration...|$|E
30|$|This study {{presented}} a factorial design, with the factor moment of treatment at two levels (before or after sintering) and surface treatment at four levels (subgroups): C (control; no surface treatment), AO (aluminum oxide <b>air</b> <b>abrasion),</b> GB (glass beads <b>air</b> <b>abrasion),</b> and HA (etching with a hydrofluoric acid solution). Sixty-four zirconia pre-sintered slabs {{were randomly assigned}} into these eight experimental subgroups (n[*]=[*] 8). The quantitative response variables were shear bond strength testing and analyses of zirconia surface roughness measured by confocal laser microscopy. The qualitative response variable was the analyses of zirconia surface morphology.|$|E

Micro <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> was discovered in 1940 in USA. Sandman’s unique patented whirl system and special hand pieces secure a unique precision and working condition of the aluminium oxide powder.

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>abrasion</b> as a caries removal {{technique}} is less aggressive than conventional techniques and is compatible {{for use with}} adhesive restorative materials. Alumina, while being currently the most common abrasive used for cutting, has controversial health and safety issues and no remineralisation properties. The alternative, a bioactive glass, 45 S 5, {{has the advantage of}} promoting hard tissue remineralisation. However, 45 S 5 is slow as a cutting abrasive and lacks fluoride in its formulation. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the cutting efficacy of dentine using a customised fluoride-containing bioactive glass Na 0 SR (38 – 80 [*]μm) versus the conventional alumina abrasive (29 [*]μm) in an <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> set-up. Fluoride was incorporated into Na 0 SR to enhance its remineralisation properties while strontium was included to increase its radiopacity. Powder outflow rate was recorded prior to the cutting tests. Principal <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> cutting tests were carried out on pristine ivory dentine. The abrasion depths were quantified and compared using X-ray microtomography. Na 0 SR was found to create deeper cavities than alumina (p< 0. 05) despite its lower powder outflow rate and predictably reduced hardness. The sharper edges of the Na 0 SR glass particles might improve the cutting efficiency. In conclusion, Na 0 SR was more efficacious than alumina for <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> cutting of dentine...|$|E

The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the microtensile bond strength of one-step self-etch adhesive to human dentin surface modified with <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> and sonic technique and to assess the morphological characteristics of the pretreated dentin surface. The occlusal enamel was removed to obtain a flat dentin surface for thirty-six humanmolar teeth. The teeth were randomly divided into three experimental groups (n = 12 per group), according to the pretreatment of the dentin: (1) control group, (2) <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> group, and (3) sonic preparation group. Microtensile bond strength test was performed on a universal testing machine. Two specimens from each experimental group were subjected to SEM examination. There was {{no statistically significant difference}} in bond strength between the three experimental groups (P> 0. 05). Mean microtensile bond strength (MPa) values were 35. 3 ± 12. 8 for control group, 35. 8 ± 13. 5 for <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> group, and 37. 7 ± 12. 0 for sonic preparation group. The use of <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> and sonic preparation with one-step self-etch adhesive does not appear to enhance or impair microtensile bond strength in dentin. 1...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess microleakage in {{conservative}} class V cavities prepared with aluminum-oxide <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> or turbine and restored with self-etching or etch-and-rinse adhesive systems. Materials and Methods: Forty premolars {{were randomly assigned}} to 4 groups (I and II: air abrasion; III and IV: turbine) and class V cavities were prepared on the buccal surfaces. Conditioning approaches were: groups I/III - 37 % phosphoric acid; groups II/IV - self-priming etchant (Tyrian-SPE). Cavities were restored with One Step Plus/Filtek Z 250. After finishing, specimens were thermocycled, immersed in 50 % silver nitrate, and serially sectioned. Microleakage at the occlusal and cervical interfaces was measured in mm and calculated by a software. Data were subjected to ANOVA and Tukey's test (&# 945;= 0. 05). RESULTS: Marginal seal provided by <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> was similar to high-speed handpiece, except for group I. There was SIGNIFICANT difference between enamel and dentin/cementum margins for to group I and II: <b>air</b> <b>abrasion.</b> The etch-and-rinse adhesive system promoted a better marginal seal. At enamel and dentin/cementum margins, the highest microleakage values were found in cavities treated with the self-etching adhesive system. At dentin/cementum margins, high-speed handpiece preparations associated with etch-and-rinse system provided the least dye penetration. CONCLUSION: Marginal seal of cavities prepared with aluminum-oxide <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> was different from that of conventionally prepared cavities, and the etch-and-rinse system promoted higher marginal seal at both enamel and dentin margins.

40|$|The {{success of}} pit and fissure {{sealants}} {{is directly related}} to their retention. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess and compare the retention of pit and fissure sealants placed using acid etch alone and a combination of <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> and acid etch techniques. 50 subjects aged 6 - 8 years were included in the study. Primary second molars and permanent first molars were sealed in all four quadrants using split mouth design. The right maxillary and mandibular molars (Group A) were treated by acid etching alone while the left maxillary and mandibular molars (Group B) were pretreated with <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> followed by acid etching before application of pit and fissure sealant. Retention of sealants was checked using Simonsen’s criteria of sealant retention after three and six months of sealant application. There was no significant difference in retention of sealants in Group A and Group B (p 0. 05). Maxillary molars showed superior retention compared to mandibular molars, which was statistically significant at both three and six months (p< 0. 05). Combining <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> pretreatment with subsequent acid etching did not result in statistically significant difference in sealant retention compared to acid etching alone in both primary and permanent molars after 3 and 6 months follow up. An additional <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> pretreatment step can be avoided in pediatric patients when placing sealants and the procedure can be completed faster with better behavior management using acid etching alone...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the effect of the macro and micro-mechanical surface {{treatment}} in the strength of indirect composite resin repairs. Specimens of composite resin submitted to asecondary polymerization were done in halter form for thecontrol group and in hemi-halter form for the other experimental groups. The specimens were storage for 30 days in artificial saliva before being submitted to a repair procedure. The macro-mechanical treatment was realized with a spherical diamond bur, and the micro-mechanical realized with an <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> system for ten seconds. After treatment, the surface was etched with phosphoric acid 37 %, and the adhesive system was used without photoactivation before the application of the repair material. After tensile strength test it was observed that repairs were weaker than control group,but it was statistically significant with the group treated with macro-mechanical retentions. Comparing the surfaces treatments, the group treated by <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> presented statistically superior tensile strength values. Based on the results it is possible to conclude that the <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> provided best strength values in indirect composite resin repairs...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} different surface conditioning methods on the tensile bond strength (TBS) and integrity of the amalgam-resin composite interface, using commercially available restoration repair systems. Methods: One hundred and sixty Gamma 2 amalgam specimens were stored in artificial saliva for 2 weeks and then {{randomly assigned to one}} of the following conditioning groups (n = 20 /group) : Group 1 : <b>air</b> <b>abrasion,</b> alloy primer and 'Panavia 21 ', Group 2 : <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> and 'Amalgambond Plus', Group 3 : <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> and 'All-Bond 3 ', Group 4 : diamond bur, alloy primer and 'Panavia 21 ', Group 5 : diamond bur and 'Amalgambond Plus', Group 6 : diamond bur and 'All-Bond 3 ', Group 7 : silica coating technique, and Group 8 : non-conditioned amalgam surfaces (control group). Subsequently, resin composite material was added to the substrate surfaces and the amalgam-resin composite specimens were subjected to TBS testing. Representative samples from the test groups were subjected to scanning electron microscopy and surface profilometry. The data was analysed statistically with one-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey's tests (alpha = 0. 05). Results: The mean TBS of amalgam-resin composite ranged between 1. 34 and 5. 13 MPa and varied with the degree of amalgam surface roughness and the type of conditioning technique employed. Significantly highest TBS values (5. 13 +/- 0. 96 MPa) were obtained in Group 1 (p = 0. 013). Conclusion: Under the tested conditions, significantly greater tensile bond strength of resin composite to amalgam was achieved when the substrate surface was conditioned by <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> followed by the application of the Panavia 21 adhesive system. Clinical significance: Effecting a repair of an amalgam restoration with resin composite via the use of <b>air</b> <b>abrasion</b> and application of Panavia 21 would seem to enhance the integrity of the amalgam-resin composite interface. Clinical trials involving the implementation of this technique are indicated to determine the usefulness of this technique...|$|E
