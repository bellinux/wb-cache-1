In total 20 834 ha of Norway spruce natural regenerations were listed in year 2002 and 26 016 ha in year 2012 (increase by 24. 9 %).

50|$|Naturally {{regenerated}} {{trees in}} an understorey prior to harvesting constitute {{a classic case}} of good news and bad news. Understorey white spruce is of particular importance in mixedwoods dominated by aspen, as in the B15, B18a, and B19a Sections of Manitoba, and elsewhere. Until {{the latter part of the}} last century, white spruce understorey was mostly viewed as money in the bank on a long-term, low interest deposit, with final yield to be realized after slow natural succession, but the resource became increasingly threatened with the intensification of harvesting of aspen. White spruce plantations on mixedwood sites proved expensive, risky, and generally unsuccessful. This prompted efforts to see what might be done about growing aspen and white spruce on the same landbase by protecting existing white spruce <b>advance</b> <b>growth,</b> leaving a range of viable crop trees during the first cut, then harvesting both hardwoods and spruce in the final cut. Information about the understorey component is critical to spruce management planning. The ability of then current harvesting technology and crews employed to provide adequate protection for white spruce understories was questioned by Brace and Bella. Specialized equipment and training, perhaps with financial incentives, may be needed to develop procedures that would confer the degree of protection needed for the system to be feasible. Effective understorey management planning requires more than improved mixedwood inventory.|$|E
40|$|Upland {{tropical}} rainforest on Pohnpei island, Federated States of Micronesia, {{declined from}} 42 % of land area in 1975 to 15 % in 1995, largely through conversion to sakau (Piper methysticum G. Forst.) cultivation. As {{part of a}} research programme aimed at restoring degraded forest, I hypothesised that forest succession is retarded in abandoned sakau plots because of a loss of <b>advance</b> <b>growth</b> after forest clearance and weeding. This would exclude <b>advance</b> <b>growth</b> from playing {{a major role in}} regeneration and prevent species relying upon <b>advance</b> <b>growth</b> from establishing in sakau plots. I compared regeneration in abandoned sakau plots with regeneration following tree-fall disturbance in intact forest. All available tree and shrub species were sampled for composition, density, height, and health. The area covered by ferns, grasses and lianas by species was scored. Light and litter were measured in the smallest sample units for analyses independent of plot types. Samples were remeasured over 15 months to track the growth and survival of the initial cohort and newly recruited seedlings. Small single-tree falls brought only subtle changes to the forest; light varied more in gaps without necessarily producing significant shifts in mean responses. Recruitment of the pioneer canopy tree Campnosperma brevipetiolata Volkens and understorey tree Aglaia ponapensis Kaneh. was significantly greater in gaps than in mature forest. With the exception of C. brevipetiolata, both the initial and newly recruited mature and gap populations were dominated by heavy-seeded species. Height growth was greater in gaps. In contrast to the forest, sakau plots were characterised by: open canopies; shallow litter depth; wide coverage of ferns, grasses and lianas; and few trees and shrubs, predominantly light-seeded small-tree and shrub species. In 15 months, seedlings and saplings grew rapidly, litter depth and fern cover increased and grass cover decreased markedly. At a broad disturbance scale (quadrat data from all plot types combined), light was correlated with species responses such as seedling abundance and height growth; however, light was not very influential at the narrower scale of small-gap dynamics. Larger and older seedlings survived longer, but new recruits initially grew faster. Results suggested that tree species that are better adapted for survival in Pohnpei's mature- and gap-phase forest, typically those with relatively heavy seeds, established from <b>advance</b> <b>growth</b> and/or seed rain. The prevalence of <b>advance</b> <b>growth</b> in Pohnpei's upland forest meant that mature-forest species were self-perpetuating into the gap phase. In contrast, species composition and abundance in sakau-plot regeneration reflected a greater reliance upon propagule input from the soil seed bank and seed rain. In abandoned sakau plots, the breakdown of <b>advance</b> <b>growth,</b> combined with a seed rain deficient in heavy-seeded species (Winthrop, 1998) and competition from ferns and grasses, excluded from establishment many species normally common in Pohnpei's forest, thereby impairing forest recovery.

There were the initial stages of fir and spruce natural regeneration present on the plot. The permanent research plot (PRP) was established in 1999. The regeneration felling was marked and subsequently performed in the same year. This stand was affected by wind storm in November 2004. The stand condition was evaluated in 2005. The total area secured by natural regeneration was 0. 17 ha. The rest of the plot (0. 08 ha), in form of scattered spots, showed no signs of natural regeneration. The analysis in 2010 confirmed that whole stand area including PRP was secured by natural regeneration of climax tree species (fir, spruce) and pioneer tree species (birch, goat willow). The height growth dynamics analysis of selected plots showed the same rate of height growth of both climax tree species in the <b>advance</b> <b>growth</b> stage.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to evaluate different methods of improving seed production, seed germination, seedling survival and seedling growth when using natural regeneration with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seed trees and shelterwoods. Two experiments and a survey study were used to evaluate effects of (i) shelterwood density and seedling height at release on survival, damage and height growth of <b>advance</b> <b>growth</b> seedlings of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.), (ii) release cutting on seed production, seed quality and needle nutrient contents in seed trees, (iii) weather and seed tree size on seed production, (iv) correlation between needle nutrient contents and seed production and seed weight, and (v) scarification in relation to seed fall. For all <b>advance</b> <b>growth</b> seedling sizes, growth was highest at shelterwood densities of 80 - 160 stems ha⁻¹, whereas the optimum density for survival was about 160 stems ha⁻¹. Height, top-shoot length and top-shoot diameter in seedlings the year before release cutting showed significant positive correlations with both survival and height growth. A majority of the small seedlings (< 20 cm) wilted the spring after overstorey release cutting, probably as a combined effect of drought in the humus and “light shock”. The only identified damaging agent causing significant mortality was pine weevil (Hylobius abietis L.). Cone and seed production were about five times higher in seed trees that had been released for 4 - 5 years, compared to control trees in the unreleased forest. Seed trees released for {{less than three years}} had about the same level of cone production as the controls. After release, the number of cones increased more in {{the lower part of the}} tree crowns than in the uppermost two metres. The concentration of nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus in needles and mean needle dry weight was significantly higher in released trees compared to unreleased control trees. N, P and K concentrations in needles were significantly positively correlated to numbers of conelets as well as to mean 1000 -seed weight. In 1996, there were about eight times more cones than in 1995, probably because summer temperatures were higher in 1994 than in 1993, the years when the respective flower buds were initiated. Trees with a diameter at breast height of 400 mm produced twice as many cones as trees with a diameter of 300 mm. By timing soil scarification in relation to a rich seed fall twice as many seedlings were established compared to scarification immediately after release cutting. Unscarified plots showed poorest result according number of seedlings, and number of plots without seedlings (0 -plots). Height growth was significantly improved by scarification...|$|E
