This is the mechanism behind some insect pesticides, such as <b>Azadirachtin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Synthetic {{chemicals}} such as diethyltoluamide (often called DEET) {{dissolved in}} an oily carrier are sometimes used. Also {{there are various}} organic, botanical repellents such as citronella oil and neem oil. Typically various types of synthetic pyrethroids such as deltamethrin, cypermethrin, and permethrin are formulated in an oil or watery suspension suitable for application direct to the skin of animals at risk. This is usually done with a pour-on applicator along the back line of the host from where the insecticide spreads downwards through the hair coat. In addition, to protect against flies such as Stomoxys and Glossina species that feed on legs and belly the insecticide can be sprayed selectively to those regions. Also cattle can be treated using self-applicators such as back-rubbers made of large bundles of fiber impregnated with the insecticide, or in automatic walk-through sprayers. The same types of insecticides are also formulated into the plastic sheet of ear-tags for protecting cattle against Musca and similar flies feeding around the head of cattle. Insect growth regulators (juvenile hormones, chitin synthesis inhibitors, etc.) are available. For example, the insect growth regulator cyromazine is effective for the prevention or treatment of infestations with blowfly larvae. Botanical extracts such as <b>azadirachtin</b> from the neem tree can be formulated as repellents and insecticides, with the potential advantage of more rapid degradation to harmless forms in the environment, lower toxicity and potentially lower cost.|$|E
500|$|Insecticides {{with active}} {{ingredients}} such as <b>azadirachtin,</b> imidacloprid, [...] emamectin benzoate, and dinotefuran are currently used {{since they are}} systemic (i.e., incorporated into the tree) and remain effective for one to three years depending on the product. Insecticides are typically only considered a viable option in urban areas with high value trees near an infestation. Ash trees are primarily treated by direct injection into the tree or soil drench. Some insecticides cannot be applied by homeowners and must be applied by licensed applicators. Initially, tree injections do not compromise tree health, but over many years drilling and chemical wounds can compromise the tree's health. Damage from emerald ash borer can continue to increase over time even with insecticide applications. Insecticide treatments are not feasible for large forested areas outside of urban areas.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} known since the late 17th century that plants contain [...] {{chemicals}} which are avoided by insects. These chemicals {{have been used by}} man as early insecticides; in 1690 nicotine was extracted from tobacco and used as a contact insecticide. In 1773, insect infested plants were treated with nicotine fumigation by heating tobacco and blowing the smoke over the plants. The flowers of Chrysanthemum species contain pyrethrin which is a potent insecticide. In later years, the applications of plant resistance became an important area of research in agriculture and plant breeding, particularly because they can serve as a safe and low-cost alternative to the use of pesticides. The important role of secondary plant substances in plant defense was described in the late 1950s by Vincent Dethier and G.S. Fraenkel. The use of botanical pesticides is widespread and notable examples include <b>Azadirachtin</b> from the neem (Azadirachta indica), d-Limonene from Citrus species, Rotenone from Derris, Capsaicin from chili pepper and Pyrethrum.|$|E

The <b>azadirachtin</b> content of neem oil varies from 300ppm to over 2500ppm {{depending}} on the extraction technology {{and quality of the}} neem seeds crushed. Nimbin is another triterpenoid which has been credited with some of neem oil's properties as an antiseptic, , antipyretic and antihistamine.

50|$|Fungicidal agents such as <b>azadirachtin</b> and phytoallexin {{have been}} used against some {{muscardine}} pathogens. Silkworm breeders dust their cages with slaked lime to discourage fungal growth. In India a dust of chaff soaked in formalin {{is applied to the}} larvae.|$|E
50|$|<b>Azadirachtin,</b> a {{chemical}} compound {{belonging to the}} limonoid group, is a secondary metabolite present in neem seeds. It is a highly oxidized tetranortriterpenoid which boasts a plethora of oxygen-bearing functional groups, including an enol ether, acetal, hemiacetal, tetra-substituted epoxide {{and a variety of}} carboxylic esters.|$|E
50|$|Limonoids are phytochemicals, {{abundant}} in citrus fruit {{and other plants}} of the families Rutaceae and Meliaceae. Currently, limonoids are under investigation for possible effects in humans, although no proof of effect exists to date. Certain limonoids are insecticides such as <b>azadirachtin</b> from the neem tree.|$|E
5000|$|This {{compound}} {{is found}} in the seeds (0.2 to 0.8 percent by weight) of the neem tree, Azadirachta indica (hence the prefix aza does not imply an aza compound, but refers to the scientific species name). Many more compounds, related to <b>azadirachtin,</b> are present in the seeds {{as well as in the}} leaves and the bark of the neem tree which also show strong biological activities among various pest insects [...] Effects of these preparations on beneficial arthropods are generally considered to be minimal. Some laboratory and field studies have found neem extracts to be compatible with biological control. Because pure neem oil contains other insecticidal and fungicidal compounds in addition to <b>azadirachtin,</b> it is generally mixed at a rate of 1 ounce per gallon (7.8 ml/l) of water when used as a pesticide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Azadirachtin</b> has {{a complex}} {{molecular}} structure; it presents both secondary and tertiary hydroxyl groups and a tetrahydrofuran ether in its molecular structure, alongside 16 stereogenic centres, 7 {{of which are}} tetrasubstituted. These characteristics explain the great difficulty encountered when trying to prepare this compound from simple precursors, using methods of synthetic organic chemistry.|$|E
50|$|<b>Azadirachtin</b> {{is formed}} via an {{elaborate}} biosynthetic pathway, but {{is believed that}} the steroid tirucallol is the precursor to the neem triterpenoid secondary metabolites. Tirucallol is formed from two units of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to form a C30 triterpene, but then loses three methyl groups to become a C27 steroid. Tirucallol undergoes an allylic isomerization to form butyrospermol, which is then oxidized. The oxidized butyrospermol subsequently rearranges via a Wagner-Meerwein 1,2-methyl shift to form apotirucallol.|$|E
5000|$|Both {{conventional}} and organic fungicides {{are available and}} {{could be used to}} limit spread and yield losses during the spring, early summer and fall on crops and susceptible neighboring plants. Each of the 17 specific races of the white rust pathogen affects different plants so monitoring is essential as much as possible to limit overuse and cost of fungicide treatments. Common OMRI fungicides include sulphur, copper oxide, rosemary oil, and <b>azadirachtin</b> products. [...] Common conventional fungicides include mefenoxam and fosetyl-aluminum products.|$|E
50|$|A {{more direct}} way of {{treating}} {{some types of}} mite are antiparasitic drugs that act systemically through the internal circulation of the animal rather than topically on the skin. The avermectin drugs such as ivermectin are used as acaricides against deeply feeding mites such as Sarcoptes and Demodex species. The drugs are delivered orally or parenterally. They can also be effective against surface-feeders such as Psoroptes species. Botanical pesticides derived directly from plants such as the neem tree (source of <b>azadirachtin</b> active ingredient) are an alternative to commercial chemical pesticides.|$|E
50|$|Apotirucallol {{becomes a}} tetranortriterpenoid when the four {{terminal}} carbons {{from the side}} chain are cleaved off. The remaining carbons on the side chain cyclize to form a furan ring and the molecule is oxidized further to form azadirone and azadiradione. The third ring is then opened and oxidized to form the C-seco-limonoids such as nimbin, nimbidinin and salannin, which has been esterified with a molecule of tiglic acid, which is derived from L-isoleucine. It is currently proposed that the target molecule is arrived at by biosynthetically converting azadirone into salanin, which is then heavily oxidized and cyclized to reach <b>azadirachtin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mites infesting {{their hosts}} at the outer {{surface of the}} skin are removed by {{treatment}} with topically applied acaricides (chemicals to kill mites and ticks applied to the skin). Numerous commercial formulations are available, representing several different chemical groups. Examples are: synthetic pyrethroids such as flumethrin; formamidines such as amitraz; and phenylpyrazoles such as fipronil. Botanical acaricides are represented by <b>azadirachtin,</b> an extract of the neem tree. Aqueous suspensions of fungi naturally pathogenic to mites, such as Metarhizium anisopliae, are another potential alternative to chemical acaricides. Good potential for vaccination of sheep to control Psoroptes ovis infestation has been demonstrated.|$|E
50|$|The {{treatments}} {{are carried out}} by spraying the olive trees with insecticides (dimethoate, deltamethrin, and phosmet). Dimethoate is commonly used for its effectiveness and relatively low cost. It may be preferable because it would leave few residues in olive oil, since it is water-soluble and would pass through the amurca. In the near future, legislative authorization for the withdrawal of use of dimethoate is to be implemented. Among the products with low impact, <b>azadirachtin</b> is a natural repellent extracted from {{the fruits of the}} neem tree. However, its effectiveness against the olive fruit fly has not yet been sufficiently tested. Among the organic insecticide literature, rotenone is also mentioned, but the use of this active ingredient, not readily available, must be authorized by established competent bodies after demonstrating the need for it.|$|E

5000|$|Fruits are {{poisonous}} {{to humans}} if eaten in quantity. However, {{like those of}} the yew tree, these toxins are not harmful to birds, who gorge themselves on the fruit, eventually reaching a [...] "drunken" [...] state. The birds that are able to eat the fruit spread the seeds in their droppings. The toxins are neurotoxins and unidentified resins, found mainly in the fruits. The first symptoms of poisoning appear a few hours after ingestion. They may include loss of appetite, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, bloody faeces, stomach pain, pulmonary congestion, cardiac arrest, rigidity, lack of coordination and general weakness. Death may take place after about 24 hours. Like in relatives, tetranortriterpenoids constitute an important toxic principle. These are chemically related to <b>azadirachtin,</b> the primary insecticidal compound in the commercially important neem oil. These compounds are probably related to the wood and seed's resistance to pest infestation, and maybe to the unattractiveness of the flowers to animals.|$|E
