5|$|On 6 April 1967, Vulcan B.2 XL385 burnt out on {{the runway}} at RAF Scampton at the {{beginning}} of its take-off run. The aircraft was carrying a Blue Steel <b>missile</b> <b>training</b> <b>round.</b> All the crew, including an Air Training Corps cadet, escaped unhurt.

50|$|The Mark 13 is {{equipped}} {{to fire the}} RIM-66 Standard, RGM-84 Harpoon, and RIM-24 Tartar missiles for anti-air and anti-ship defense, and is capable of firing the Standard {{at a rate of}} one every eight seconds. Its 40-round magazine consists of two concentric rings of vertically stored missiles, 24 in the outer ring and 16 in the inner. Total capacity was reduced by 1 due to a requirement to carry a Guided <b>Missile</b> <b>Training</b> <b>Round</b> (GMTR) in order to test system functionality. In case of a fire, the system {{is equipped}} with magazine sprinkling, CO2 suppression and booster suppression. It is also equipped with a dud jettison function to eject a round overboard if it fails to fire.|$|R
