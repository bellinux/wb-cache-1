500|$|A second survey {{carried out}} by the king's commissioners, Thomas Legh and Richard Leyton, {{provided}} for the final suppression on charges of a lack of quality of religious life. Prior James Cockerell of Guisborough was forced to resign and was replaced by Robert Pursglove, who was loyal to the king. The priory's dissolution was not welcomed by locals, who derived economic benefit from its presence – in 1536, around 500 families depended on it for their livelihood. The strength of feeling was recorded in a letter from Lord Conyers and Sir John Bulmer to Thomas Cromwell: [...] "On Sunday, 11th July , at Gysburn in Yorkshire, when the parish priest was declaring the articles [...] directed by the King to the Archbishop of York, one John Atkeynson alias Brotton came violently and took book forth of the priest's hands, <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> in pieces." [...] Popular discontent sparked the Pilgrimage of Grace, in which Prior Cockerell was implicated. When the revolt failed, he was hanged at Tyburn with the Prior of Bridlington, the Abbot of Jervaulx and the former Abbot of Fountains.|$|E
500|$|When Craddock {{received}} the preliminary war warning on 27 July, he ordered Essex {{to join her}} sister [...] in Bermuda, which she reached three days later. The ship was ordered to patrol the area north and northwest to protect British shipping and destroy any German commerce raiders. As the Germans appeared to be concentrating their efforts in the Caribbean, Craddock ordered Essex south to reinforce his forces there in early September. On 7 September, she captured the tender, , for the armed merchant cruiser , en route from Halifax to Jamaica. The ship continued to patrol the sealanes from the Caribbean Sea to Canadian waters {{until the end of}} February 1915, when she escorted a troop convoy from Halifax to Queenstown, Ireland. Essex then sailed to Barrow-in-Furness where she began a refit that lasted until 29 April. Now assigned to the 7th Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet, she spent the next several weeks in Avonmouth or Scapa Flow before being transferred to Cruiser Force I and began patrolling the area between the Azores, Madeira, Cape Verde and Gibraltar on 8 June. Rear-Admiral Archibald Moore, commander of the 9th Cruiser Squadron, hoisted his flag aboard the ship on 4 September <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> down on the 29th. Essex began a brief refit at Gibraltar on 1 October that lasted until the 26th and then resumed patrolling the Central Atlantic. She captured a German merchantman, , on 3 May 1916 in the Canary Islands. The ship resumed patrolling until her arrival in Devonport on 17 August; Essex was paid off days later.|$|E

On one occasion, when Crawford asked Hughes what she could do for him, he grabbed her head <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> towards his crotch. Other allegations were made by two other women who worked with Hughes.|$|E

[...] In the ensuing struggle, Son was shot in the foot and had {{to let go of the}} attacker. While other RCMP officers converged on Zehaf-Bibeau, Son limped out of the building and calmly told a CBC reporter outside, [...] "I will survive." [...] Just inside the Centre Block, Zehaf-Bibeau exchanged gunfire with security personnel and was wounded.|$|E
2500|$|In the two CBC Television mini-series about Pierre Trudeau, Trudeau and Trudeau II: Maverick in the Making, Douglas {{is portrayed}} by Eric Peterson. In the {{biography}} mini-series, , which aired on 12 and 13 March 2006, also on CBC, Douglas was played by Michael Therriault. The movie was widely derided by critics as being historically inaccurate. Particularly, the movie's portrayal of James Gardiner, premier of Saskatchewan {{from the late}} 1920s to mid-1930s, was objected to by political historians and the Gardiner family itself. In response, the CBC consulted a [...] "third party historian" [...] to review the film <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> from future broadcasts, including halting all home and educational sales. Prairie Giant was shown in Asia on the Hallmark Channel on 11 and 12 June 2007.|$|E
2500|$|He {{employed}} the McKenzie Brothers, from Station Terrace Dutton Park, {{for a price}} of 600 pounds. [...] The removal, in March 1934, {{became part of the}} folk law in the McKenzie family business. [...] It was recalled as the most difficult job they ever did – down and across the Enoggera Creek bed, roads terrible, hill steep, and house too large. [...] It took one month and two days to move it. [...] "It was fascinating to watch...they lowered the house, in one piece, on to large timber slides, dragged the house to the creek bank and then slid <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> across the creek on substantial hardwood bearers. It was hard tough work and required a lot of muscle. Once across the creek the contractor raised the house on to a large wooden wheeled jinker." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{first use}} of {{electrification}} on a main line was on a four-mile stretch of the Baltimore Belt Line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B) in 1895 connecting the main portion of the B to the new line to New York through [...] a series of tunnels {{around the edges of}} Baltimore's downtown. Parallel tracks on the Pennsylvania Railroad had shown that coal smoke from steam locomotives would be a major operating issue and a public nuisance. Three Bo+Bo units were initially used, {{at the south end of}} the electrified section; they coupled onto the locomotive and train <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> through the tunnels. Railroad entrances to New York City required similar tunnels and the smoke problems were more acute there. A collision in the Park Avenue tunnel in 1902 led the New York State legislature to outlaw the use of smoke-generating locomotives south of the Harlem River after 1 July 1908. In response, electric locomotives began operation in 1904 on the New York Central Railroad. In the 1930s, the Pennsylvania Railroad, which had introduced electric locomotives because of the NYC regulation, electrified its entire territory east of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1870s {{she began}} {{an affair with}} the Mexican lawyer and {{entrepreneur}} Julián Montiel y Duarte, which caused a scandal in Mexico City. The city's social elite boycotted her performances and hired hecklers to harass her during performances. Her reputation recovered following her performance in Linda di Chamounix, but she kept her vow never to sing in Mexico City again. In 1883, with her reputation (and economic situation) again in decline, she began a tour of northern Mexico with her troupe of Italian opera singers. The tour began in Guaymas and proceeded to La Paz, Baja California Sur. It was in La Paz that she sang {{for the last time}} on stage [...] the title role in Maria di Rohan [...] with the performance taking place in a theatre improvised from a disused sand pit. On 22 August, the troupe arrived in the port city of Mazatlán, where they were to perform Il trovatore and Aida. The city of Mazatlán prepared an elaborate welcome for her. Her boat docked at a pier decorated with garlands of flowers, and she was greeted by a band playing the Mexican National Anthem. When her carriage arrived, her admirers unhitched the horses <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>it</b> themselves to the Hotel Iturbide, where she once again saluted the crowds from her balcony. However, within a few days, she and 76 of the troupe's 80 members were to die in the yellow fever epidemic that swept the city shortly after their arrival.|$|E
