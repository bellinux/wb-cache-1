Due to Hibiki's low magical experience, Misaki worries about Hibiki succeeding {{as a member of the}} staff. Like Hibiki, Misaki cannot perform magic, though she still has a vast knowledge of magic at her disposal.

She had been saved by Asuma and hopes to be of use to him.|$|E
5|$|Sharaf {{writes that}} Reich's {{personality}} changed after {{his experience in}} Oslo. He became socially isolated and kept his distance even from old friends and his ex-wife.

Walter and Peter, along with Massive Dynamic staff, debate how to disable the machine, but Peter realizes that he himself is the only option.

25|$|In , we {{have two}} examples: Yomiel, the {{original}} bad guy, who was <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>that</b> was neither alive nor dead, as his body constantly regenerated because {{of the power of}} a meteorite that entered his back and lodged in his heart; and Sissel which becomes a more literal example after going 10 years in the past to save his master Yomiel from such fate, but in turn the meteorite lodged inside the black cat himself, allowing him to be both dead and alive.|$|E

25|$|Dearborn's {{account of}} General Putnam's conduct {{was based upon}} his {{personal}} memories of the battle at Bunker Hill, some 43 years previous, whereas the younger Putnam, though not present at the battle, consulted and collected depositions from past veterans of the battle.

25|$|Randolph was {{admired by}} the {{community}} and his supporters for his fiery character and was known as <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>that</b> was passionate about education and equality for all. He applied rousing electioneering methods, which he also enjoyed as a hobby. Randolph appealed directly to yeomen, using entertaining and enlightening oratory, sociability, and community of interest, particularly in agriculture. This resulted in an enduring voter attachment to him regardless of his personal deficiencies. His defense of limited government appeals to modern and contemporary conservatives, most notably Russell Kirk (1918–1994).|$|E
25|$|Zemfira asks Aleko if {{he misses}} {{the splendor of}} his homeland, but he {{responds}} that his only desire is to spend his life with her in voluntary exile. (ll.174–176).

(ll.181–216). This {{is thought to be}} a reference to the Roman poet Ovid, who was banished to Tomis in 8AD.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He don't know,' {{replied the}} Captain, putting {{his hand on}} Walter's shoulder. 'I do. It came of helping <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>that's</b> dead now, and that's cost my friend Gills many a hundred pound already. More {{particulars}} in private, if agreeable.' ...|$|R
60|$|Though, I must confess, {{the more}} knowing the wicked is, {{or the more}} light and {{goodness}} such a one sins against, the greater will his judgment be; these shall have greater damnation: it shall be more tolerable at the judgment for Sodom than for them (Luke 10:12, 20:47). There is <b>a</b> wicked <b>man</b> <b>that</b> goes blinded, and <b>a</b> wicked <b>man</b> <b>that</b> goes with his eyes open to hell; there is <b>a</b> wicked <b>man</b> <b>that</b> cannot see, and <b>a</b> wicked <b>man</b> <b>that</b> will not see the danger he is in; but hell-fire will open both their eyes (Luke 16:23). There are that are wicked, and cover all with a cloak of religion, and there are that proclaim their profaneness; but they will meet both in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone; 'The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God' (Psa 9:17).|$|R

25|$|Peter grew to be {{extremely}} tall as an adult, especially for the time period. Standing at 6ft 8in (203cm) in height, the Russian tsar was literally {{head and shoulders above}} his contemporaries both in Russia and throughout Europe. Peter, however, lacked the overall proportional heft and bulk generally found in <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>that</b> size. Both his hands and feet were small, and his shoulders were narrow for his height; likewise, his head was small for his tall body. Added to this were Peter's noticeable facial tics, and he may have suffered from petit mal, a form of epilepsy.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1987 Dennis Condrey left Jim Crockett Promotions, {{abandoning the}} Midnight Express {{when they were}} {{scheduled}} to appear at an event in Los Angeles as he changed his plane ticket to go elsewhere in order {{to drop out of}} sight. Manager Jim Cornette brought in <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>that</b> Bobby Eaton was familiar with, having feuded with him extensively in Memphis – Stan Lane. When Lane joined Eaton to form the new Midnight Express it put the final nail in the coffin of the Fabulous Ones, ending their 5-year run. Keirn, meanwhile, would run a wrestling school in Florida, which he trained future superstars like Mike Awesome, Dennis Knight, Diamond Dallas Page, and Dustin Rhodes, to name a few.|$|E
