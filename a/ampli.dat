Because the gate currents are small, the circuit exhibits a high-pass characteristic with a cuto frequency less than 1 Hz.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new password authentication and key agreement protocol, AMP, {{based on the}} <b>ampli</b> ed password idea. The intrinsic problems with password authentication are the password itself has low entropy and the password le {{is very hard to}} protect. We presentthe <b>ampli</b> ed password proof and the <b>ampli</b> ed password le for solving these problems. A party commits the high entropy information and <b>ampli</b> es her password with that information in the amplifed password proof. She never shows any information except that she knows it. Our <b>ampli</b> ed password proof idea is very similar to the zero-knowledge proof in that sense. We adds one more idea � the <b>ampli</b> ed password le for password le protection. Aserver stores the <b>ampli</b> ed veri ers in the <b>ampli</b> ed password le that is secure against a server le compromise and a dictionary attack. AMP mainly provides the password-veri er based authentication and the Di e-Hellman based key agreement, securely and e ciently. AMP is easy to generalize in any other cyclic groups. In spite of those plentiful properties, AMP is actually the most e cient protocol among the related protocols due to the simultaneous multiple exponentiation method. Several variants such as AMPi,AMPn,AMPn+, AMP +,AMP++, and AMPc are also proposed. Among them, AMPn is actually the basic protocol of this paper that describes the <b>ampli</b> ed password proof idea while AMP is the most complete protocol that adds the <b>ampli</b> ed password le. AMPi simply removes the <b>ampli</b> ed password le from AMP. Intheend,wegive a comparison to the related protocols in terms of e ciency.

40|$|Purpose. <b>Ampli</b> ® cation {{of genetic}} {{sequences}} on chromosome 12 q 13 is frequently found in soft tissue tumours. However, for the M DM 2 gene, over-expression of the MDM 2 protein {{has not always}} been shown to accompany gene <b>ampli</b> ® cation, raising the possibility that <b>ampli</b> ® cation of genetic sequences targets alternative genes on chromosome 12 q 13 for over-expression. To investigate this discrepancy, we have examined 129 soft tissue tumours for <b>ampli</b> ® cation of the MDM 2 gene using Southern analysis, and 39 of these tumours were also examined by immunohistochemical staining for MDM 2 over-expression. Results. Gene <b>ampli</b> ® cation was identi ® ed in 14 / 114 (12. 3 %) of the malignant tumours, but was not identi ® ed in any of the benign tumours; 21 / 39 (54 %) of the malignant tumours also demonstrated MDM 2 over-expression. Within this group the MDM 2 gene was over-expressed in every tumour in which the gene <b>ampli</b> ® cation was found, and over-expression in the absence of gene <b>ampli</b> ® cation was also found in an additional 10 tumours. D iscussion. These data demonstrate a clear correlation between the presence of M DM 2 <b>ampli</b> ® cation and MDM 2 over-expression, and provide persuasive evidence therefore that the <b>ampli</b> ® cation of genetic sequences on chromosome 12 q 13 in soft tissue sarcomas targets the M DM 2 gene for over-expression.

Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) [1] fabricated {{in a standard}} microelectronic technology provide an attractive solution for these demanding applications. The signal-to-noise ratio of MAPS can be increased by using in-pixel <b>ampli</b> ers.

The charge collection ef ciency and total capacitance at the <b>ampli</b> er input is in uenced by the size of charge collecting diode. Therefore, in order to achieve better MAPS performances, both the geometry of the charge collecting diode and the <b>ampli</b> er design have to be considered in the optimization process. In this work different <b>ampli</b> er designs and geometries of the charge collecting diode are proposed.

40|$|Thesis (MSc) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2013. This work is {{a thesis}} {{regarding}} the energy scaling of end-pumped Ho:YLF amplifiers. The work includes: {{a brief review of}} laser physics and models, the development of a suitable three dimensional time resolved numerical model, a parametric study of double pass <b>ampli</b> ers simulated using the model, comparison between the simulation and the experimental results of a double pass <b>ampli</b> er system, and simulation of a high energy single pass <b>ampli</b> er. A three dimensional time resolved numerical model of an end-pumped <b>ampli</b> er was developed. A rate equation model was used to simulate the absorption and emission of light, energy transfer upconversion, and spontaneous emission within the gain medium. In the traveling wave approximation the propagation of light through the gain medium was modelled {{with the use of a}} split step method that included di raction and gain. A parametric study was performed to nd the design parameters for an end-pumped two pass ampli- er. Limited optimisation of several <b>ampli</b> er parameters was performed. The study focused on the optimisation of the energy per pulse through changes to the following parameters: crystal length, laser beam size, pump beam sizes, and pump wavelength. The nal design speci cations for an experimental system were for a 100 mm long 0. 5 % (atm.) doped Ho:YLF gain medium, pump and seed beams with spot sizes with e ective beam sizes of 1 mm and 0. 95 mm respectively and a pump wavelength of 1892 nm. The simulation predicted pulse energies above 480 mJ when seeded by a 55 mJ pulse at repetition rates of 50 Hz. The experimentally realised system with similar design parameters produced the highest reported energy, 330 mJ, from an end-pumped Ho:YLF <b>ampli</b> er. Comparison between the simulation and the experimental results showed signi cant deviation. The deviation was explained by the e ect of parameters not included previously in the simulation. These parameters were the power of the continuous component of the seed beam, and the energy transfer upconversion rate. Limitations and delity of the numerical model with respect to the experimental system are discussed, notably the model of the highly divergent pump beam was simplistic. Preliminary simulation results of a high energy single pass <b>ampli</b> er predict that energy scaling in Ho:YLF follows linearly with respect to pump power and that in the ideal case, multi-Joule operation is possible at 50 Hz with optical to optical e ciencies of 19 %...|$|E

It was mainly focussed on the design, layout and building of the analog microwave subsystems but also some programming skills were necessary to generate the required input signal. By means of two synchronized direct digital synthesizers, two linearly frequency sweeping signals (chirps) at low-frequency band (base band) are generated and two mixers upconvert these signals to a high-frequency band around a carrier at 5. 3 GHz.

Most existing algorithms for primer selection are concerned with computing a primer pair for each DNA sequence. In generalizing the arbitrarily primed PCR, etc., to the case that all DNA sequences of target objects are already known, like about 6000 ORFs of yeast, we may design a small set of primers so that all the targets are PCR <b>ampli</b> ed and resolved electrophoretically in a series of experiments. This is quite useful because deceasing the number of primers greatly reduces the cost of experiments. Pearson et al. [7, 8] consider nding a minimum set of primers covering all given DNA sequences, but their method does not meet necessary biological conditions such as primer <b>ampli</b> cation and electrophoresis resolution. In this paper, based on the modeling and computational complexity analysis by Doi [2], we propose algorithms for this primer selection problem. These algorithms do not necessarily minimize the number of primers, but, since basic versions of these problems are shown to be computationally intractable, especially even for approximability with the length resolution condition, this is inevitable. In the algorithms, the <b>ampli</b> cation condition by a primer pair and the length resolution condition by electrophoresis are incorporated. These algorithms are based on the theoretically well-founded greedy algorithm for the set cover in computer science. Preliminary computational results are presented to show the validity of this approach. The number of computed primers is much less than a half of the number of targets, and hence is less than one forth of the number needed in the multiplex PCR. ...|$|E
40|$|Much recent {{research}} has sought to explain the cyclical amplitude of unemployment uctuations in the US. This paper shows that <b>ampli</b> 8 ̆ 5 cation of the cyclical variation of unemployment {{can be obtained from}} adding two very simple features to an otherwise standard model of the aggregate labor market, namely downward sloped short run la-bor demand and endogenous job destruction. This generalized model is able to match more closely the cyclicality of both job 8 ̆ 5 nding and employment to unemployment ows observed in US data. Contrary to standard models, the model can generate ampli-cation while maintaining realistic surplus to employment relationships. In addition, we uncover a novel source of <b>ampli</b> 8 ̆ 5 cation of cyclical shocks that is generated by the interaction of countercyclical unemployment inows and job creation. We are especially grateful to Gary Solon and Matthew Shapiro for their comments, support, and encour-agement, and to anonymous reviewers at the National Science Foundation for very constructive comments.

40|$|Transition in laminar {{separation}} bubbles (LSB) is investigated by {{direct numerical simulation}} (DNS). A 2 D Tollmien-Schlichting (TS) wave is forced upstream of the LSB. Its amplitude saturates in the re-attachment region. Additional pulse-like 3 D modes are excited in the LSB with very low ('linear`) amplitude. They start to grow in time. Recently, {{it was observed that}} a mechanism of secondary, temporal <b>ampli</b> cation exists if the Reynolds number is su ciently high [2]. It is shown, that a 3 D instability of 2 D high-shear layers close to the wall, which are present periodically in the LSB supports this mechanism. The temporal growth nally results in non-linear 3 D amplitudes and the 3 D modes saturate. Strong non-linear interactions take place. However, there are signi cant similarities compared to the state of linear 3 D amplitudes. It is concluded, that the mechanism of temporal secondary <b>ampli</b> cation is likely to have major impact on the onset of transition and on the self-sustaining character of the 3 D modes in the re-attachment region at su ciently high Reynolds numbers...|$|E
40|$|Our thesis work {{is based}} on {{revealing}} minor informative variations in a video which are hard to perceive, that can be further exaggerated to extract hidden variations of color and motions in a video. In our thesis we apply di erent techniques of a video decomposition like Laplacian, Steerable and Gaussian pyramids to observe the improvement in performance of the videos. We start with a standard input video to decompose it in di erent spatial pool of frequencies, the temporal ltering process {{is applied to the}} frames to extract hidden signals. The resultant signals from the temporal processing are then <b>ampli</b> ed by a given factor to reveal hidden information in the videos. These <b>ampli</b> ed signals are added back to the original signals and then a pyramid is collapsed to generate an output video. Performance of Gaussian and Steerable pyramids for video decomposition is evaluated over Eulerian motion magni cation. The output videos from all pyramids decomposition is computationally analyzed and compared with each other through SSIM and PSNR graphs. The video processing time is used to compare decomposition methods. It is observed that Eulerian motion magni cation with Steerable pyramid decomposition has potential of revealing hidden motions more than Laplacian and Gaussian pyramids, precisely in monitoring and diagnostic applications. Steerable pyramid decomposition method performs better than the other methods when input video is noisy. A standard video has been taken as input and magni ed to amplify the small motion in it which was invisible to human eye. This method processes pixels at speci c positions in a video where it has got low frequencies and <b>ampli</b> es them to see small changes in video work improvements in Eulerian motion magni cation and color <b>ampli</b> cation by using Gaussian and Steerable pyramids for video decomposition were investigated. To observe small changes in a video and to extract subtle changes Steerable and Gaussian pyramids were used. The effects on di erent videos with di erent formats and noise environments when subjected to this system were observed. Proposed model was found to be better in performance then contemporary Eulerian magni cation using Laplacian pyramid in some cases. Magni cation using Steerable pyramid showed better results than Laplacian, as seen from PSNR, SSIM graphs and comparison. 926 /B Peoples colony # 1 Faisalabad,Pakistan Phone Number # + 92 - 300 - 660163...|$|E
