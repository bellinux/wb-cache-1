Participants did rate shared information other group members mentioned <b>as</b> more <b>important</b> than unshared information others mentioned.

A comparison of minority and majority members in minority-containing groups found that minority members were more open to information than majority members...|$|R

5|$|A {{group or}} {{family is a}} {{vertical}} column in the periodic table. Groups usually have more significant periodic trends than periods and blocks, explained below. Modern quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure explain group trends by proposing that elements within the same group generally have the same electron configurations in their valence shell. Consequently, elements in the same group {{tend to have a}} shared chemistry and exhibit a clear trend in properties with increasing atomic number. However, {{in some parts of the}} periodic table, such as the d-block and the f-block, horizontal similarities can be <b>as</b> <b>important</b> as, or more pronounced than, vertical similarities.|$|E

5|$|As in an oratorio, {{the written}} text in a choral symphony can be <b>as</b> <b>important</b> as the music, and the chorus and soloists can {{participate}} equally with the {{instruments in the}} exposition and development of musical ideas. The text can also help determine whether the composer follows symphonic form strictly, {{as in the case}} of Rachmaninoff, Britten and Shostakovich, or whether they expand symphonic form, {{as in the case of}} Berlioz, Mahler and Havergal Brian. Sometimes the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures, as with Szymanowski, Schnittke and, again, Havergal Brian. The composer can also choose to treat the text fluidly, in a manner more like music than narrative. Such was the case with Vaughan Williams, Mahler and Philip Glass.|$|E
5|$|Associate Justice Stephen Breyer wrote a dissenting opinion, {{with whom}} Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg joined. Breyer {{disagreed}} with the majority's holding that fair-minded jurists could disagree on whether Alvarado was in custody, holding that the facts compelled the single conclusion that Alvarado was in custody. Breyer held that the actions the police did not do, such as arrest Alvarado or threaten him, were not <b>as</b> <b>important</b> as what the police did do. Specifically, the police had Alvarado's parents bring him to the police station, brought Alvarado to an interrogation room, kept his parents out, and questioned him for two hours.|$|E
