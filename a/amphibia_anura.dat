40|$|Background: The {{influence}} of Pleistocene climatic fluctuations on intraspecific diversification in the Qinling–Daba Mountains of East Asia remains poorly investigated. We tested hypotheses concerning refugia {{during the last}} glacial maximum (LGM) in this region by examining the phylogeography of the swelled vent frog (Feirana quadranus; Dicroglossidae, <b>Anura,</b> <b>Amphibia).</b> Methodology/Principal Findings: We obtained complete mitochondrial ND 2 gene sequences of 224 individuals from 34 populations of Feirana quadranus for phylogeographic analyses. Additionally, we obtained nuclear tyrosinase gene sequences of 68 F. quadranus, one F. kangxianensis and three F. taihangnica samples to test for mitochondrial introgression among them. Phylogenetic analyses based on all genes revealed no introgression among them. Phylogenetic analyses based on ND 2 datasets revealed that F. quadranus was comprised of six lineages which were separated by deep valleys; the sole exception is that the Main Qinling and Micang–Western Qinling lineages overlap in distribution. Analyses of population structure indicated restricted gene flow among lineages. Coalescent simulations and divergence dating indicated that the basal diversification within F. quadranus {{may be associated with}} the dramatic uplifts of the Tibetan Plateau during the Pliocene. Coalescent simulations indicated that Wuling, Daba, and Western Qinling–Micang–Longmen Mountains were refugia for F. quadranus during the LGM.

40|$|Spatial {{patterns}} in biodiversity variation at a regional scale are rarely {{taken into account}} when a natural reserve is to be established, despite many available methods for determining them. In this paper, we used dimensions of occurrence of 105 species of <b>Anura</b> (<b>Amphibia)</b> in the cerrado region of central Brazil to create a regional system of potential areas that preserves all regional diversity, using three different algorithms to establish reserve networks: "greedy", rarity, and simulated annealing algorithms. These generated networks based on complementarity with 10, 12, and 8 regions, respectively, widely distributed in the biome, and encompassing various Brazilian states. Although {{the purpose of these}} algorithms is to find a small number of regions for which all species are represented at least once, the results showed that 67. 6 %, 76. 2 %, and 69. 5 % of the species were represented in two or more regions in the three networks. Simulated annealing produced the smallest network, but it left out three species (one endemic). On the other hand, while the greedy algorithm produce a smaller solution, the rarity-based algorithm ensured that more species were represented more than once, which can be advantageous because it takes into consideration the high levels of habitat loss in the cerrado. Although usually coarse, these macro-scale approaches can provide overall guidelines for conservation and are useful in determining the focus for more local and effective conservation efforts, which is especially important when dealing with a taxonomic group such as anurans, for which quick and drastic population declines have been reported throughout the world...|$|R
40|$|Investigations {{dealing with}} the {{problems}} on {{the early stages of}} development of the heart of the toad, have left very little for further study except the question of the origin of the angioblast. However {{on the development of the}} heart of the giant salamander, there are on record only a few experiments which are, as yet, far from satisfaction. Consequently Prof. Shikinami gave me the problem on the first appearance and the further developmental stages of the heart primordia in the amphibia, especially on the difference between these two species of the <b>amphibia</b> (urodela and <b>anura).</b> From many embryos, thirteen giant salamanders and twelve toads were selected and used for this study. A large majority of them were fixed in Zenker's fluid, and stained with borax carmine. After the subsequent treatments in the usual manner, these specimens were embedded in paraffin, trimmed and cut in transverse serial sections with a thickness of ten microns. A number of models were prepared according to Born-Peter's method of wax-plate reconstruction. From the results of these experiments, the following summary and conclusions may be made: 1) The heart primordia in the amphibia is formed from the bilateral primordia which are derived from the cardiogenic plate. 2) In the giant salamander, the pericardial cavity and the angioblast first appear in an embryo with 12 - 13 somites, and the ventral and the dorsal mesocardium are first formed in 17 and 20 somites stages respectively. The ventral mesocardium is more defined than that of the toad. The bending of the heart is first indicated in an embryo with 22 - 23 somites and the blood-corpuscles first appear in the heart in the 28 - 29 somite stage. 3) In the toad, the pericardial cavity first appears in an embryo with 8 somites and it is earlier than the first appearance of the angioblast, since the latter is first distinguishable in the 5 - 6 somite stage. The formation and the rupture of the ventral and the dorsal mesocardium are indicated a little earlier than in the giant salamander. The time of the first appearance of the blood-corpuscles in the heart and the bending of the heart, is also somewhat earlier than the latter...|$|R

40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} DNA of {{the rice}} frog, Fejervarya limnocharis (<b>Amphibia,</b> <b>Anura),</b> was obtained using long-and-accurate {{polymerase chain reaction}} (LA-PCR) combining with subcloning method. The complete nucleotide sequence (17, 717 bp) of mitochondrial genome was determined subsequently. This mitochondrial genome is characterized by four distinctive features: the translocation of ND 5 gene, a cluster of rearranged tRNA genes (tRNA(Thr), tRNA(Pro), tRNA(Leu) ((CUN))) a tandem duplication of tRNA(Mer) gene, and eight large 89 -bp tandem repeats in the control region, as well as three short noncoding regions containing two repeated motifs existing in the gene cluster of ND 5 /tRNA(Thr) /tRNA(Pro) /tRNA(Leu) /tRNA(Phe). The tandem duplication of gene regions followed by deletions of supernumerary genes can be invoked to explain the shuffling of tRNAM(Met) and a cluster of tRNA and ND 5 genes, as observed in this study. Both ND 5 gene translocation and tandem duplication of tRNA(Met) were first observed in the vertebrate mitochondrial genomes. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} two {{new species}} of treefrogs of the Boophis goudoti species group mainly based on analyses of mor-phology and molecular genetics. Boophis popi sp. n. {{is characterized by a}} red iris and distinctly elevated reticulations on the dorsum. It is distributed in submontane rainforest between 1000 – 1500 m above sea level. Boophis fayi sp. n. is unique among the species in the B. goudoti group by exhibiting a green outer iris in life and males lacking a distinct supratympanic fold. It occurs in lowland rainforests of northeastern Madagascar. Both species differ by substantial genetic differentiation in the 16 S mRNA gene fragment from known members in the species group:> 8 % and> 6 % pairwise divergence, respec-tively, whereas the minimum pairwise divergence between the two new species is 5. 3 %.

Institute of Anatomy, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague Abstract Aortic arches development {{in the course of}} Pelobates fuscus metamorphosis Larval development of Spade-foot Toad Pelobates fuscus (<b>Amphibia,</b> <b>Anura)</b> is modified compared to tetrapod ancestors. However, it is still possible from its metamorphosis to reconstruct changes, which have occurred during the transition of vertebrates onto the dry land. Transformations of aortic arches during the metamorphosis have been studied by the corrosion casting of the vascular systém with Mercox. Corrosion casts were subsequently studied with a scanning electron microscope. Aim {{of this study is to}} compare development of aortic arches of Pelobates fuscus with other anuran species and contribute to the findings about the transformation of the aortic arches during the transition of the vertebrates onto the dry land. Aortic arches, which in larval period supply the gills, are considerably transformed due to the reduction of the gills and transition on the breathing of atmospheric oxygen. Aortic arches are in Pelobates suddenly transformed after a long period of gradual preparation and reduction of gill blood [...] ...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{variants}} of the sacral-urostyle area structure in common platanna is considered, {{which gives the}} new information on the origine of the compound sacrum. It originated from the association of diapophyses in the common sacral wing. This variant is not reproduced in the individual variability of the forms pos-sessing the cylindrical sacrum process. The features of the sacrum variability in common platanna in com-parison with the true frogs indicate to the essential distinctions in the morphogenesis of these two kinds of simple sacrum. Key words: <b>Amphibia,</b> <b>Anura,</b> sacral structure, variations, compound sacrum. The Anura’s sacrum manifests multiple {{variants of}} the normal structure. Its individual variability is rather high, though it is different in different species.

During spermatogenesis AcP activity is manifested in heterophagous lysosomes of Sertoli cells. This phagocytic function appears to be hormone-independent. We examined the expression pattern of AcP during the reproductive period of four species belonging to different vertebrate groups: Tilapia rendalli (Teleostei, Cichlidae), Dendropsophus minutus (<b>Amphibia,</b> <b>Anura),</b> Meriones unguiculatus (Mammalia, Rodentia), and Oryctolagus cuniculus (Mammalia, Lagomorpha). To demonstrate AcP activity, cryosections were processed for enzyme histochemistry by a modification of the method of Gömöri. AcP activity was similar in the testes of these four species. Testes of T. rendalli, D. minutus and M. unguiculatus showed an intense reaction in the Sertoli cell region. AcP activity was detected in the testes of D. minutus and O. cuniculus in seminiferous epithelium regions, where cells are found in more advanced stages of development. The seminiferous epithelium of all four species exhibited AcP activity, mainly in the cytoplasm of either Sertoli cells or germ cells. These findings reinforce the importance of AcP activity during the spermatogenesis process in vertebrates. © FUNPEC-RP...|$|E

This is the first electron microscopic study of this species. Cepedea longa possesses a developed fibrillar skeletal system, composed of longitudinal fibrillar bands and transversal fibrils as well as numerous thin microfibrils dispersed in the endoplasm, which may {{play an important role}} in morphogenesis and offer some resilience to deformations of the cell. Longitudinal microfibrils are polarizing elements of kineties, bordering the somatic kineties on the left side and possibly responsible for kinetosome alignment. Two types of vesicles exist in the somatic cortex: globular endocytotic vesicles and flattened exocytotic vesicles. As to the nuclei of C. longa, a thick microfibrillar layer was observed to attach to the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear envelope. This fact suggests no necessary connection between the presence of this microfibrillar layer and the number of nuclei. In addition, some unknown tightly-packed microtubular structures in the nucleoplasm were observed for the first time in opalinids; neither their nature nor physiological significance is known.

Some coefficients were also estimated: diameters ratio (df/ds), cross-sectional index (ik), principal moments of inertia ratio (Imax/Imin.). Coefficients of variation of linear dimensions (11. 9 - 20. 0 %) anrelative bone mass (22 - 35 %) were established. Moments of inertia of various bones are more variable (CV = 41. 67 - 56. 35 %) in relation to radii of inertia (CV = 9. 68 - 14. 67 %). Shaft’s cross-sectional shape is invariable in all cases.

40|$|The {{organogenesis}} and {{differentiation of}} striated tail musculature in Xenopus laevis (<b>Amphibia,</b> <b>Anura)</b> are an effective experimental model {{for studies on}} muscular dystrophy pathogenesis induced by oxidative stress [1]. Stage 37 / 38 embryo histopathological diagnosis reveals myoblasts with defects in contractile apparatus mainly localized at cell extremities and, in stage 47 larvae, myocyte myofibrils are separated from sarcolemma and showily shrinking. Stage 37 / 38 embryo electron microscopic analysis shows great myofibril disorder at cell extremities and a delay in intersomitic junction membrane differentiation. These alterations are most evident in stage 47 larva myocytes [2 - 4]. In many muscular dystrophies, the principal defect {{is the loss of}} a mechanical link between the contractile apparatus and the extracellular matrix which somehow leads to muscle fragility, contraction-induced damage and cell necrosis [5]. Confocal microscopy allows to analyze the link among myofibril actin, the sub-sarcolemmal protein dystrophin, the intermediate filament desmin and the sarcolemma dystrophin glycoprotein complex. Actin stained with phalloidin-TRITC labelled confirms the shrinking of myofibril extremities.

40|$|The {{study of}} the meiotic {{chromosomes}} of the <b>amphibia</b> <b>Anura</b> offers various findings that we consider to be useful from a taxonomic point of view. In {{the case of the}} male line, the techniques for the {{study of the}} meiotic chromosomes are relatively simple. Since meiosis takes place en-tirely in the testicle, the chromosomes may be studied on slices of that organ, prepared with the normal his tological techniques (d. 5; 6), or on squashes of fragments of the testicle itself. With this latter method, which is more used today on account of its simplicity and the better results that normally ensue from it for these studies, good non-permanent preparations may be obtained in a few minutes by covering fragments of the testicle, immediately after its removal, with acetic orcein or acetic carmine (for] 0 - 20 minutes) and crushing them between two glass slides. In order to obtain permanent preparations, the testicle is fixed for one hour in a mixture of ethyl alcohol (3 parts) and acetic acid (1 part); it is then softened in a 450 / 0 acetic acid/water solution for a fcw hours and the smal...|$|E

This analysis, combined with previous phylogenetic studies, serves {{as a framework for}} future work in rhacophorid systematics. The monophyly of Rhacophonts is strongly confirmed except for the species R hainanus, which is the sister taxon to A. odontotarsus. The non-monophyly of the newly designated genus Aquixalus by Delorme et al. [Delorme, M., Dubois, A., Grosjean, S., Ohler, A., 2005. Une nouvelle classification generique et subgenerique de la tribu des Philautini (<b>Amphibia,</b> <b>Anura,</b> Ranidae, Rhacophorinae). Bull. Mens. Soc. Linn. Lyon 74, 165 - 171] is further confirmed. Aquixalus (Aquixalus) forms a well-supported monophyletic group within Kurixalus, whereas, Aquixalus (Gracixalus) is more closely related to species of Rhacophorus, Polypedates, and Chiromantis. Philautus as currently understood, does not form a monophyletic group. Philautus (Kirtixalus) is the sister group to the clade comprising Kurixalus and Aquixalus (Aquixalus), and more remotely related to Philautus (Philautus). Chiromantis romeri does not cluster with species of Chiromantis, and forms a basal clade to all rhacophorids save Buergenia. We propose some taxonomic changes that reflect these findings, but further revision should await more detailed studies, which include combined morphological and molecular analyses, with greater species sampling.

The vertebrate fossils reported here come from the main fossiliferous level which includes terrestrial, freshwater and marine taxa: vertebrates, Mammalia (both tribosphenic and nontribosphenic therians), Theropoda (Coelurosauria and Sauropoda), Crocodylia, Squamata (Serpentes), Chelonia, <b>Amphibia</b> (<b>Anura,</b> Gymnophiona, Caudata) and fish (Dipnoi, Teleostei, Actinopteri, Cladistia, Chondrostei); invertebrates (Gastropoda, Bryozoa) and plants (charophytes). Amongst these taxa are the earliest records of some fish, Amphibia and tribosphenic Mammalia in South America and/or in the world. The fish concerned are: Polypteriformes (Latinopollia suarezi), Siluriformes of the family Andinichthyidae (Andinichthys) and two new families, Osteoglossiformes of the subfamily Heterotidinae (Osteoglossidae), Perciformes of the family Latidae, Dipnoi of the family Lepidosirenidae (Lepidosiren cf. paradoxa). The Amphibia concerned are: indeterminate Gymnophiona, Noterpetontidae (Noterpeton bolivianum). Pajcha Pata is the only known locality in South America with both non-tribosphenic and tribosphenic therian mammals. The depositional environment was probably estuarian or lagoonal as indicated by a mixed continental, freshwater, and marine fauna. Comparison of this: local fauna with faunas of the same age at localities: belonging to the same proximal part of the El Molino basin on one hand, and with others belonging to the distal part on the other hand, shows that the two continental areas seem to have their own endemic freshwater fish fauna (except the Characidae and the Lepisosteidae, known in all levels of Bolivia). However, these two areas have the same marine taxa. This implies some influence of the sea in the whole basin. Calculated temperatures of the marine waters rangefrom 13 to 17 degrees for a latitute of about 22 degreesS, implying a southern Pacific upwelling. The El Molino Basin could have been also connected with the open sea through present-day Argentina and not only Venezuela as thought until now...|$|E
