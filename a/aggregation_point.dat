40|$|Abstract — The data {{aggregation}} and in-network processing approaches is {{to combine the}} data arriving from different sources (sensor nodes) at certain <b>aggregation</b> <b>points</b> (or simply aggregators) in route, eliminate redundancies by performing simple processing at the <b>aggregation</b> <b>points,</b> and minimize {{the total amount of}} data transmission before forwarding data to the external base station (BS). Removing redundancies results in transmitting fewer numbers of bits, and hence reduces energy consumption and increases the sensor nodes lifetimes...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{challenge in}} the design of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is to maximize their lifetime. Data aggregation has emerged as a basic approach in WSNs {{in order to reduce the}} number of transmissions of sensor nodes, hence minimizing the overall power consumption in the network. Data aggregation is affected by several factors, such as the placement of <b>aggregation</b> <b>points,</b> the <b>aggregation</b> function, and the density of sensors in the network. The determination of an optimal selection of <b>aggregation</b> <b>points</b> is thus extremely important. We present exact and approximate algorithms to find the minimum number of <b>aggregation</b> <b>points</b> in order to maximize the network lifetime. Our results clearly indicate that the routing tree built by SDRINA provides the best aggregation quality when compared to existing algorithms. The obtained results show that our proposed solution outperforms in different performance metrics and in different scenarios required by WSNs. We also study the tradeoffs between energy savings and the potential delay involved in the data aggregation process...|$|R

This includes both the backhaul network to the nearest <b>aggregation</b> <b>point,</b> and any other parts of the network needed to connect the <b>aggregation</b> <b>point</b> to the nearest point of presence on the operator's core network.

40|$|A {{primary goal}} {{in the design of}} {{wireless}} sensor networks is lifetime maximization, constrained by the energy capacity of batteries. One well known method to reduce energy consumption in such networks is message aggregation. This method reduces the number of messages transmitted in the network, thus extending its lifetime. In order to be effective, aggregation requires messages to be delayed in their path throughout the network. This technique, therefore, must define where and for how long a message should be delayed. This paper shows how <b>aggregation</b> <b>points</b> and corresponding <b>aggregation</b> delays can be determined so that the overall energy efficiency of the system is improved. An algorithm is presented which allows the efficient computation of <b>aggregation</b> <b>points</b> and delays. The benefits of the algorithm is verified through simulation experiments...|$|R

5000|$|In such networks, radio {{communication}} is used {{both for the}} Wi-Fi service and for the [...] "backhaul" [...] or pathway to the Internet. This means that the nodes only need a wire for power (hence the habit of installing them on power and light utility poles).

Nodes then relay traffic, somewhat like a bucket brigade, from the laptop to the aggregation node. This limits {{the way in which the}} network can be grown incrementally: coverage starts near the <b>aggregation</b> <b>point</b> and, as the mesh grows, new coverage can only grow out from the edge of the mesh. If a new, isolated area is to be covered, then a new <b>aggregation</b> <b>point</b> must be constructed.

40|$|Abstract — Sensor network {{protocols}} must minimize energy due {{to their}} resource-constrained nature. Large amounts of redundant data are produced by the sensors in such networks, however sending unnecessary data wastes energy. One common technique used {{to reduce the amount}} of data in sensor is data aggregation. Therefore, we consider the impact and cost of data aggregation in sensor networks to achieve energy efficient operation. We propose a new notion of energy efficiency that can be used to decide where <b>aggregation</b> <b>points</b> in the network should be placed. The main factor affecting energy efficiency is the location of the data <b>aggregation</b> <b>points.</b> The optimal choice of these points is determined by the aggregation efficiency, which determines the amount of data reduction. We present our aggregation tree algorithm “Oceanus ” that produces energyefficient aggregation trees by taking into account the aggregation efficiency.

50|$|Due {{to severe}} {{cracks in the}} tower of the church, in 1993 it was {{necessary}} to start the restoration of the building. On that occasion the foundations of the church were inspected.

Work started in 1999 and lasted until 2002 and foreseen the excavation of the total surface of the church and its restoration. A European project was launched that aimed at the complete study of the building and at the reconstruction of its original 10th-century appearance by following a rigid scientifically supervised procedure.

50|$|Later, a third son of Go-Daigo's, Prince Morinaga, was {{appointed}} seii taishogun {{together with his}} brother Norinaga, a move that immediately aroused Ashikaga Takauji's hostility. Takauji believed the military class {{had the right to}} rule and considered himself not a usurper but, since the Ashikaga descended from a branch of the Minamoto clan, rather a restorer of Minamoto power. When the Hōjō garrison at Rokuhara was destroyed in 1333, he immediately stepped in and installed there his office (bugyōsho). It kept order in the city and in general took over the original's function. Extending its authority to controlling travel along highways, issuing passports and exercising rights previously belonging to the shogunate's deputies (the Rokuhara Tandai), Takauji showed he believed that samurai political power must continue. His setting himself apart {{as a representative of the}} military made him an <b>aggregation</b> <b>point</b> for the warriors' discontent.

5000|$|From Thomas Becket's canonization in 1173, {{until the}} {{dissolution}} of the monasteries in 1538, his shrine at Canterbury became the most important in the country, indeed [...] "after Rome...the chief shrine in Christendom", and it drew pilgrims from far and wide. Winchester, apart from being an ecclesiastical centre in its own right (the shrine of St Swithin), was an important regional focus and an <b>aggregation</b> <b>point</b> for travellers arriving through the seaports on the south coast. [...] Indeed, this was the route taken by Henry II on his pilgrimage of atonement for the death of Bishop Thomas from France To Canterbury in July 1174. Travellers from Winchester to Canterbury naturally used the ancient way, as it was the direct route, and research by local historians has provided much by way of detail—sometimes embellished—of the pilgrims' journeys. The numbers making their way to Canterbury by this route were not recorded, but the estimate by the Kentish historian William Coles Finch that it carried more than 100,000 pilgrims a year is surely an exaggeration. [...] A separate (and more reliably attested) route to Canterbury from London was by way of Watling Street, as followed by the storytellers in The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—To {{benefit from}} data {{aggregation}} in large scale sensor networks, an <b>aggregation</b> <b>point,</b> i. e. {{the place where}} data are aggregated, must be close to sources. In event triggered sensor networks, this {{can be achieved by}} dynamically constructing a tree connecting the sources rooted at a nearby node. However, this incurs high control and maintenance overhead. With static trees, the distance (∆) between sources and the <b>aggregation</b> <b>point</b> can be as high as O(n) [1] where n is the number of nodes in the network. This diminishes the benefit of data aggregation, thereby limiting the scalability of static trees. In this paper we propose AFT, a structure with multi-level overlapping clusters. Packet forwarding decisions on AFT are made on the fly when packets are being forwarded and it bounds the distance between the <b>aggregation</b> <b>point</b> and sources by O(δ) irrespective of network size, where δ is the diameter of the event. This guarantees that packets can be aggregated near sources without the overhead of constructing a dyanmic structure and therefore is scalable. We prove that in the worst case, AFT guarantees aggregation at a node that is at most 2 (1 + √ 13) δ away from the sources. I...|$|E
