40|$|An {{extracellular}} poly (β-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) depolymerase was purified from a Penicillium sp. DS 9701 - 09 a by centrifugation, ultrafiltration, precipitation and {{gel filtration}} chromatography. The specific {{activity of the}} purified enzyme was 37. 9 -folds {{higher than that of}} the culture supernatant and the recovery yield was 11. 8 %. The PHB deploymerase molecular mass was 44. 8 kDa from analysis of both Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Matrix-assisted laser desorption-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer. The isoelectric point of 6. 7 for the enzyme was determined by a two-dimensional electrophoresis. The optimum enzyme activity was observed at a temperature of 50 °C and pH 5. 0. The apparent K m of the enzyme was found to be 1. 35 mg/mL. The PHB depolymerase consisted of 16 kinds of normal amino acids. The secondary structure of the enzyme was determined by CD spectrum. α-helix and β-turn were found to be 66 % and 34 % for the enzyme without <b>ammonium</b> <b>sulphite.</b> Chemical inhibition on the PHB depolymerase activity was examined and EDTA was found to have a significantly inhibitory effect.

40|$|The {{exchangeable}} cations and anionic pollutants of Okpoka-Woji River {{serving as}} a sink for effluents of industries located in the vicinity within the Trans-Amadi industrial area were carried out. Sediment samples were collected from six sampling stations located along the channel {{for the assessment of}} exchangeable cations namely calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium and nitrite, nitrate, ammonia, <b>ammonium,</b> sulphate, <b>sulphite</b> and phosphate. The mean values for the exchangeable cations namely calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium ranged from 387. 56 to 1775. 78 mg/kg; 2093. 67 to 4517. 38 mg/kg; 134. 27 to 1393. 49 mg/kg and 1140. 87 to 8293 mg/kg respectively. The mean values for nitrate, nitrite, ammonia and ammonium varied from 49. 44 to 98. 97 mg/kg, 45. 94 to 73. 44 mg/kg, 13. 55 to 27. 30 mg/kg and 14. 33 to 28. 87 mg/kg respectively. Sulphate, sulphite and phosphate mean values ranged from 1492. 17 to 9389. 58 mg/kg, 1243. 47 to 7062. 25 mg/kg and 3. 13 to 8. 01 mg/kg respectively. The work showed that the river is polluted by theses parameters from the activities of industries operating in the area...|$|R
5000|$|The {{material}} {{fed into}} the digester must be small enough to allow the pulping liquor to penetrate the pieces completely. In the case of wood, the logs are chipped and the chips screened so that what is fed to the digester is a uniform size. The oversize chips are rechipped or used as fuel, sawdust is burned. The screened chips or cut plant material (bamboo, kenaf, etc.) goes to the digester where it is mixed an aqueous solution of the pulping chemicals, then heated with steam. In the kraft process the pulping chemicals are sodium hydroxide and sodium sulphide and the solution is known as white liquor. In the sulfite process the pulping chemical {{is a mixture of}} metal (sodium, magnesium, potassium or calcium) or <b>ammonium</b> sulfite or <b>sulphite.</b> After several hours in the digester, the chips or cut plant material breaks down into a thick porridge-like consistency and is [...] "blown" [...] or squeezed from the outlet of the digester through an airlock. The sudden change in pressure results in a rapid expansion of the fibres, separating the fibres even more. The resulting fibre suspension in water solution is called [...] "brown stock".|$|R
