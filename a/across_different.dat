5|$|Calhoun's basic {{concern for}} {{protecting}} the diversity of minority interests is expressed in his chief contribution to political science—the idea of a concurrent majority <b>across</b> <b>different</b> groups as distinguished from a numerical majority.

5|$|Growth {{rates of}} pterosaurs once they hatched varied <b>across</b> <b>different</b> groups. In more primitive, long-tailed pterosaurs ("rhamphorhynchoids"), such as Rhamphorhynchus, the average growth rate {{during the first}} year of life was 130% to 173%, {{slightly}} faster than the growth rate of alligators. Growth in these species slowed after sexual maturity, and it would have taken more than three years for Rhamphorhynchus to attain maximum size. In contrast, the more advanced, large pterodactyloid pterosaurs, such as Pteranodon, grew to adult size within the first year of life. Additionally, pterodactyloids had determinate growth, meaning that the animals reached a fixed maximum adult size and stopped growing.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Air Combat Command {{requested}} {{the testing of}} a 600-gallon external fuel tank which would extend the A-10's loitering time by 45–60 minutes; flight testing of such a tank had been conducted in 1997, but did not involve combat evaluation. Over 30 flight tests were conducted by the 40th Flight Test Squadron to gather data on the aircraft's handling characteristics and performance <b>across</b> <b>different</b> load configurations. It was reported that the tank slightly reduced stability in the yaw axis, {{but there was no}} decrease in aircraft tracking performance.|$|E

The reviewer also praised Viralheat for its user interface and easy cross-posting <b>across</b> <b>different</b> social networks, but said its reporting and analytics were limited. For example, only three date-ranges could be selected when generating a report.|$|E

5|$|The {{underlying}} {{concept of}} ecosystem {{can be traced}} back to 1864 in the published work of George Perkins Marsh ("Man and Nature"). Within an ecosystem, organisms are linked to the physical and biological components of their environment to which they are adapted. Ecosystems are complex adaptive systems where the interaction of life processes form self-organizing patterns <b>across</b> <b>different</b> scales of time and space. Ecosystems are broadly categorized as terrestrial, freshwater, atmospheric, or marine. Differences stem from the nature of the unique physical environments that shapes the biodiversity within each. A more recent addition to ecosystem ecology are technoecosystems, which are affected by or primarily the result of human activity.|$|E

5|$|Different {{authors have}} {{variously}} reported the birth length at between , and the maturation length at between , with females usually maturing at a slightly larger size than males. This range of sizes may reflect life history differences in crossback stingarees <b>across</b> <b>different</b> parts of its range. Both sexes mature at around {{six years of}} age, and can live to at least 11 years. The crossback stingaree may hybridize naturally with the closely related yellowback stingaree off southern New South Wales, where the distributions of the two species overlap and apparent hybrid offspring with intermediate color patterns have been found. If true, this would represent {{one of the few}} known cases of hybridization among cartilaginous fishes.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest VII is {{best known}} for its huge size. Without {{completing}} the game's side quests, a single game of Dragon Quest VII can take a hundred hours or more. In terms of gameplay, not much has changed from previous installments; battles are still fought in a turn-based mode from a first person perspective. Although non-battle sequences are rendered in 3D, battles themselves are still portrayed two dimensionally. The ability to talk with the party characters in and outside of battles was added to this game. They offer advice about battle strategies and plot points, or simply comment on how they feel at a given moment. There are four ways and means of locomotion: feet, boat, magic carpet, and skystone. Each of these can move <b>across</b> <b>different</b> terrain.|$|E

5|$|God of War is a third-person single player action-adventure {{video game}} with hack and slash elements, viewed from a fixed camera perspective. The player {{controls}} the character Kratos in combo-based combat, platforming, and puzzle game elements, and battles foes who primarily stem from Greek mythology, including undead soldiers, harpies, minotaurs, Medusa and her Gorgons, cyclopes, wraiths, Sirens, satyrs, centaurs, cerberuses, and boss opponents—the Hydra {{and a giant}} minotaur known as Pandora's Guardian. Platforming elements require the player to climb walls and ladders, jump across chasms, swing on ropes, and balance across beams to proceed through sections of the game. Some puzzles are simple, such as moving a box so that the player can {{use it as a}} jumping-off point to access a pathway unreachable with normal jumping, but others are more complex, such as finding several items <b>across</b> <b>different</b> areas of the game to unlock one door.|$|E
