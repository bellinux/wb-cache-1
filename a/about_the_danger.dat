5|$|A {{few minutes}} later at 11:00, The Great Artiste dropped {{instruments}} attached to three parachutes. These instruments also contained an unsigned letter to Professor Ryokichi Sagane, a physicist at the University of Tokyo who studied with three of the scientists responsible for the atomic bomb at the University of California, Berkeley, urging him to tell the public <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> involved with these weapons of mass destruction. The messages were found by military authorities but not turned over to Sagane until a month later.

5|$|One mine-awareness {{campaign}} involving {{billboard advertising}} attracted {{criticism from the}} Ministry of Tourism and the Croatian National Tourist Board (CNTB) because the signs were placed in tourist areas, far from any mine-suspected areas. The Ministry of Tourism and the CNTB welcomed the effort's humanitarian aspect, but considered the signs a potential source of unwarranted negative reaction from tourists. Tourist guidebooks of Croatia include warnings <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> posed by mines in the country, and provide general information about their location.|$|E

5|$|By November the Sixth Army had {{occupied}} most of Stalingrad, pushing the defending Red Army {{to the banks}} of the Volga River. By this stage, there were indications of an impending Soviet offensive which would target Wehrmacht forces around the city, including increased Soviet activity opposite the Sixth Army's flanks, and information gained through the interrogation of Soviet prisoners. However, the German command was intent upon finalizing its capture of Stalingrad. In fact, head of Army General Staff General Franz Halder had been dismissed in September after his efforts to warn <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> which was developing along the over-extended flanks of the Sixth Army and the Fourth Panzer Army. As early as September the Soviet Stavka (high command) began planning a series of counteroffensives to encompass the destruction of German forces in the south, fighting in Stalingrad and in the Caucasus, and against Army Group Center. Ultimately, command of Soviet efforts to relieve Stalingrad was put under the leadership of General Aleksandr Vasilevsky.|$|E
5|$|The {{relief efforts}} were {{hindered}} by {{the composition of}} the mud, which made it nearly impossible to move through without becoming stuck. By the time relief workers reached Armero twelve hours after the eruption, many of the victims with serious injuries were dead. The relief workers were horrified by the landscape of fallen trees, disfigured human bodies, and piles of debris from entire houses. This was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster of the 20th century, surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée, and is the fourth-deadliest volcanic event recorded since 1500 AD. The event was a foreseeable catastrophe exacerbated by the populace's unawareness of the volcano's destructive history; geologists and other experts had warned authorities and media outlets <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> over the weeks and {{days leading up to the}} eruption. Hazard maps for the vicinity were prepared, but poorly distributed. On the day of the eruption, several evacuation attempts were made, but a severe storm restricted communications. Many victims stayed in their houses as they had been instructed, believing that the eruption had ended. The noise from the storm may have prevented many from hearing the sounds from Ruiz until it was too late.|$|E
5|$|Jardine {{threatened}} to withdraw his {{team from the}} Fourth and Fifth Tests unless the Australian Board retracted the accusation of unsporting behaviour. The MCC responded angrily to the accusations of unsporting conduct, played down the Australian claims <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> of Bodyline and {{threatened to}} call off the tour. The series had become a major diplomatic incident by this stage, and many people saw Bodyline as damaging to an international relationship that needed to remain strong. The public in both England and Australia reacted with outrage towards the other nation. Alexander Hore-Ruthven, the Governor of South Australia, who was in England at the time, expressed his concern to J. H. Thomas, the British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs that this would cause {{a significant impact on}} trade between the nations. The standoff was settled only when Australian Prime Minister Joseph Lyons met members of the Australian Board and outlined to them the severe economic hardships that could be caused in Australia if the British public boycotted Australian trade. Given this understanding, the Board withdrew the allegation of unsportsmanlike behaviour two days before the fourth Test, thus saving the tour. However, correspondence continued for almost a year. Fingleton was dropped after scoring a pair in the third Test, and England won the final two matches to win the series 4–1.|$|E

25|$|The arsenal caused massive local protests, and the {{municipal}} council made a declaration where it supported the concerns raised <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> of an explosion. The protests were not taken consideration to, following {{a report from}} another division of the military that stated {{that the risk of}} an explosion was close to zero. Construction started in May 1961. The hangar that was built at Torp was used by Horten Flyfabrikk from 1956 to 1965. It had up to 270 employees and had previously been based at Jarlsberg. Marinens Hovedverft performed maintenance of a single aircraft in 1967, but terminated operations at Torp afterwards.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{has launched a}} two-phase plan to eliminate FGM, originally by 2008. According to the local human rights organisations fighting FGM, the educational phase (workshops, videos, and theatre) continues in cities, and FGM reportedly has decreased substantially among children of educated parents. In many instances, FGM practitioners have agreed to stop the practice in exchange for other income-generating activity. The National Committee Against Violence Towards Women linked all the NGOs combating FGM, and high-profile work by Former Teachers' Union leader Fatoumata Sire Diakite, president of the Association for the Progress and Defense of Women (APDF) have led efforts to educate rural women and community leaders <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> FGM poses.|$|E

25|$|While {{navigating}} the Elbe about eight miles above Brunsbuttel {{she was given}} permission to proceed until Cuxhaven {{at the mouth of}} the North Sea. There was no pilot ship available to take her through the minefield at Cuxhaven so she attempted to proceed on her own along the usual channel. Tugboat men of the harbour tried to warn San Wilfridos master <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> by shouting. The master then tried to evade the mines by attempting to go full speed astern. However, at approximately four p.m., a strong ebb tide carried San Wilfrido into the mines. Three explosions followed and crippled the ship making it the first British naval loss of the war. A German tug took the crew away and made them prisoners.|$|E
25|$|According to the Stairs Expedition's doctor Joseph Moloney {{and third}} officer Christian de Bonchamps, with {{negotiations}} at stalemate, Msiri reacted to an ultimatum and to Stairs flying the CFS flag without his consent, by departing {{in the night}} to a fortified village at Munema {{on the outskirts of}} Bunkeya. The next day, 20 December 1891, Stairs sent his second-in-command, Belgian Lieutenant Omer Bodson with de Bonchamps and 100 askaris to arrest Msiri. Despite de Bonchamps' concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger,</b> Bodson went into Munema with a dozen men and confronted Msiri in front of about 300 of his warriors. Msiri said nothing but in anger started to draw the sword which had been a gift from Stairs. Bodson drew his revolver and shot Msiri three times, killing him. A fight erupted, and Bodson was shot and mortally wounded by one of Msiri's men, dying later.|$|E
25|$|The {{night before}} he was {{scheduled}} to leave Shanghai in June 1931, Xiang Zhongfa, who was one of Zhou's most senior agents, decided {{to spend the night in}} a hotel with his mistress, ignoring Zhou's warnings <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger.</b> In the morning, a KMT informant who had been trailing Xiang spotted him as he was leaving the hotel. Xiang was immediately arrested and imprisoned within the French Concession. Zhou attempted to prevent Xiang's expected extradition to KMT-controlled China by having his agents bribe the chief of police in the French Concession, but the KMT authorities appealed directly to the authorities of the French Concession, ensuring that the chief of police could not intervene. Zhou's hopes that Xiang would be transferred to Nanjing, giving him an opportunity to kidnap Xiang, also came to naught. The French agreed to transfer Xiang to the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, under the command of General Xiong Shihui, who subjected Xiang to relentless torture and interrogation. Once he became convinced that Xiang had given his torturers all the information that they requested, Chiang Kai-shek ordered Xiang to be executed.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} days of the {{epidemic}} Haseltine recognized a two-fold problem in public perception. Many, both within and outside of the scientific/medical community, did not believe the epidemic would ever pose a serious threat to populations. Others believed that AIDS patients posed an immediate threat of infection and must avoided. To address this issue Haseltine help to create and guide several different groups. One of the most successful groups was the American Foundation of AIDS Research. Haseltine became the first chairman of the scientific advisory board of AMFAR. The mission was twofold, to make start up grants available for those wishing to begin work on HIV/AIDS and to de-stigmatize HIV/AIDS. Many of today's leaders of HIV/AIDS received their first support from AMFAR. The second goal was to provide a body of scientific and medical experts willing to speak out <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> and magnitude of the epidemic and to provide a credible reference for those worried about causal transmission- in others words a group a qualified experts to speak about the real dangers of the disease and to counter unjustified fears. AmFAR continues in this role today.|$|E
25|$|The Cabinet Minister Jan Christiaan Smuts and the Cabinet Secretary Maurice Hankey, whom Lloyd George had {{contemplated}} appointing to Kiggell's job, {{were sent}} on a five-day mission to France {{coinciding with the}} Lovat Fraser article. On the first evening they met Haig at GHQ and assured him that Lloyd George {{had no wish to}} replace him, although they had in fact been tasked by the Prime Minister on 18 January “to find out who are the rising men” amongst the British generals. Hankey wrote that “the atmosphere of complaisant optimism that formerly pervaded GHQ” was now “conspicuous by its absence”, that general opinion was that the US Army would not be ready for a major offensive before 1920, and that there was open talk, in which Haig participated, of a compromise peace, Haig being worried <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> of France or Italy collapsing and believing that Britain had already gained more from the war than other powers and risked being left exhausted compared to the USA. Hankey also recorded that officers had been angered by the Lovat Fraser article. Over the next few days Hankey and Smuts took discreet soundings among the Army Commanders to see whether any of them were willing to replace Haig - none of them were. The only possibility seemed to be Claud Jacob, GOC II Corps. Hankey formed the opinion that nobody important amongst the British generals thought a major German attack likely.|$|E
25|$|Mazzocchi {{became a}} {{national}} staffer in 1965. That year, long-time OCAW president O.A. Knight retired. Secretary-Treasurer Alvin F. Grospiron ran for president, and Mazzocchi strongly backed his candidacy. The election was a bitter one. Knight had allowed the Central Intelligence Agency to use the union as a cover for covert operations, and had accepted {{large sums of money}} from the agency. Because of his support for Gospiron, Mazzocchi was appointed OCAW's Citizenship-Legislative Director in 1965. He used his position to push strongly for health and safety language in union contracts, as well as for state and federal legislation on the issue. In 1969 and 1970, he organized a series of public meetings in which OCAW and other union members testified about the chemicals they were handling and the health problems they were having. Scientists also testified at these public hearings <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>danger</b> of these chemicals. The public meetings gained widespread press attention. Mazzocchi also used the hearings to help educate workers on the legislative process, and trained them to act as lobbyists for federal health and safety legislation. The media attention and pressure from union members provided critical support for congressional attempts to pass comprehensive occupational health and safety legislation. In December 1970, Congress enacted and President Richard Nixon signed the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA). Nixon specifically cited Mazzocchi's leadership and grassroots organizing efforts as key in winning passage of the Act.|$|E
