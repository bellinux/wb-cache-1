The number of boycotts of Jewish business throughout the 1930s showed the <b>anti-Semitic</b> <b>feeling</b> within the German population. The fact that Jews were now second class citizens, <b>anti-Semitic</b> <b>feeling</b> was allowed to spread and citizens could discriminate against Jews without {{the fear of the}} judicial system, as racism had been made legal. Grunberger argues that many in Germany wanted to see social change and the idea of ‘folk community’ was popular at the time. Anti-Semitism and much of the stereotypes used for Jews was already present in much of Germany before the Nazis came to power[...]|$|R

50|$|As in most Western societies, {{a certain}} amount of <b>anti-Semitic</b> <b>feeling</b> has been present in New Zealand for quite some time. This feeling was not {{particularly}} strong, however, as evidenced by the fact that Julius Vogel, a practising Jew, was able to become Premier in 1873. Vogel did, however, suffer jibes about his faith, and political cartoonists frequently employed various Jewish stereotypes against him. The fact that he served as Treasurer was particularly played upon, with stereotypes of Jewish bankers and moneylenders being brought out. However, none of this anti-Semitism was conducted in an organised fashion, being simply the views of individuals rather than any sort of political movement.|$|R

40|$|The term “anti-Semitism” {{is in fact}} a misnomer, {{since it}} implies {{antipathy}} towards all people of Semitic origin. Not all conflicts between Jews and non-Jews should be seen as due to anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism is still very alive today and needs to be constantly monitored and exposed. However, ancient anti-Semitism should not be studied through the lenses of our modern perceptions. Anti-Jewish trends seem to have originally developed in the Diaspora, more specifically in Egypt. In the period up to 150 B. C. an anti-Semitic attitude still manifested itself very sporadically. In the following period it increased considerably and gradually and became more internationalized. Evidence of <b>anti-Semitic</b> <b>feelings</b> and attitudes is found in Egypt, Babylonia, Palestine, Syria, Asia Minor and Rome...|$|R

5000|$|Breen {{was deeply}} worried that Jewish filmmakers {{would try to}} use Nazi mistreatment of Jews during the 1930s {{as a vehicle for}} propaganda.

[...] Breen claimed that plans to make such pictures were being coordinated through the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League, which he claimed was [...] "conducted and financed almost entirely by Jews". As a result of Breen's anti-Semitic and anticommunist views, the censorship board pressured Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to drop plans to film Sinclair Lewis's anti-fascist novel, It Can't Happen Here.|$|R

The Stora and Valensi families moved to Paris in the late 1860s when there was growing <b>anti-Semitic</b> <b>feeling</b> in their native Algeria. Clémentine married Nathan Stora in Paris in 1868. He was an antiques dealer who specialised in goods from North Africa and had a shop at 24 Boulevard des Italiens named Au Pacha which later moved to the fashionable boulevard Hausmann. The tourist trade with French Algeria created a strong market for Algerian and North African themed material in France and the business claimed to be suppliers to the Government General of Algeria.|$|R
25|$|Joel's brother Woolf Joel {{was murdered}} in Johannesburg in 1898, {{probably}} by a blackmailing con-man named Karl Frederic Moritz Kurtze going under the pseudonym of Ludwig von Veltheim. Although {{there was plenty of}} evidence that Veltheim had been threatening Woolf Joel, the defense was that Veltheim had not been properly compensated for planning a kidnap scheme against the Boer leader Paul Krueger. That, the all Boer jury, and the mixture of anti-British and <b>anti-Semitic</b> <b>feelings</b> towards the deceased enabled Veltheim to avoid conviction. Freed, he was immediately deported from the Boer territories. For the next decade, Veltheim was following a series of con-games in Europe, but in 1907, he turned up in London, and started making threatening demands against Joel, who reported him to Scotland Yard, and the police arrested Veltheim. There was a trial for extortion, and Veltheim used the same defense he had previously used in Johannesburg, but the British jury was unconvinced and found him guilty. He was sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment.|$|R
50|$|Particularly valued items {{included}} the helmet, sword, and seal of Charles VIII, {{as well as}} a book containing portraits of the ladies whose favors he had enjoyed during the invasion. During Francesco's absence from Mantua, Daniele da Norsa, a Jewish banker, had purchased a house in the city's San Simone quarter and replaced the image of the Virgin Mary which decorated its façade with his own coat of arms. The regent, Sigismondo Gonzaga, ordered him to restore the depiction. Although Daniele agreed to do so, the populace, inflamed <b>by</b> <b>anti-semitic</b> <b>feeling,</b> destroyed his house.When Francesco returned, he forced Daniele to fund a chapel and a devotional painting. The painting was to be executed by the Mantuan court painter, Mantegna, and was inaugurated in 1496 on the anniversary of the duke's victory at Fornovo. The work was placed in the church of Santa Maria della Vittoria, which had been constructed over the ruins of Daniele da Norsa's house.|$|R
50|$|The theory {{regarding}} {{the suicide of}} Barnato has also been tied to sinister later events. One of his heirs, Woolf Joel {{was shot and killed}} in his business offices in Johannesburg by a con-man named Karl Frederick Kurtze who went away with the name of Ludwig von Veltheim in 1898. In the trial for murder, von Veltheim hinted that {{he was supposed to be}} orchestrating a plot to kidnap Paul Kruger, President of the Transvaal Boer Republic, that Barnato and Joel were backing. The murder stemmed from blackmail against Joel, but von Veltheim claimed he was only seeking his promised payment. As a result, von Veltheim was able to get an acquittal from a Boer Jury (possibly due to anti-British and <b>anti-Semitic</b> <b>feelings</b> towards the deceased). It was suggested by Brian Roberts, in his book The Diamond Magnates, that Barnato may have been approached by von Veltheim too, and unsettled by his physical threats and the possibility of exposure.|$|R
50|$|The {{final section}} of this book says that the strong German youth join the Hitler youth to stand {{together}} as one nation. On the other hand, the Jews are told to go away. A picture of grumpy looking Jews walking under {{a sign that says}} ‘one-way road. Hurry. Hurry. The Jews are our misfortune’ and in the text the phrase ‘what a disgusting picture’ is used to show the <b>anti-Semitic</b> <b>feeling.</b> This shows that this book is teaching children that the quicker Germany gets rid of the Jews the better a country it will be. The Nazi Party and Hitler himself put great emphasis on training the Aryans for the Future. Hitler wanted the German youth to be taught the greatness of the Third Reich and how to be a citizen of Germany. This was shown in his speech at the Nuremberg rally in1935, to the Hitler youth, when he says that the Hitler Youth has made Germany more ‘sturdy and disciplined’.|$|R
5000|$|The {{question}} of whether or not Marlowe's work is anti-Semitic is multi-faceted. Some of the conversation around anti-Semitism in The Jew of Malta focuses on authorial intent, the {{question of}} whether or not Marlowe intended to promote anti-Semitism in his work, while other critics focus on how the work is perceived, either by its audience at the time or by modern audiences. Stephen Greenblatt, offering a Marxist critique of The Jew of Malta, believes that Marlowe intended to utilize readily available <b>anti-Semitic</b> <b>feelings</b> in his audience in a way that made the Jews [...] "incidental" [...] to the social critique he offered. That is, he wished to use anti-Semitism as a rhetorical tool rather than advocating for it. In this, Greenblatt says, Marlowe failed, instead producing a work that is, because of its failure to [...] "discredit" [...] the sentiments it toys with, a propagator of anti-Semitism. Such rhetorical attempts, he says, [...] "underestimated the irrationality... fixation...and persistence of anti-Semitisim".|$|R

5000|$|Many {{observers}} {{have said that}} Peretz's charge of anti-Semitism {{on the part of}} Marius—who castigated figures such as Martin Luther for their anti-Semitic writings in his scholarly work—was false.

University of Tennessee historian Milton Klein, whose European relatives were murdered during the Holocaust in Hungary, said that he and Marius had often argued about the Israel-Palestine issue during their 26 years of friendship, but Marius had never said a single thing that indicated any <b>anti-Semitic</b> <b>feelings.</b> In Gore: A Political Life, ABC News correspondent Bob Zelnick wrote that Marius had no history of anti-Semitism and that [...] "most Gore's staff felt that Marius had been wronged and that the vice president had acted to keep Peretz happy rather than to protect his office." ...|$|R
5000|$|The trial soon {{focussed}} on the plagiarism and forgery of {{the notorious}} Protocols of the Elders of Zion.

The alleged link between Freemasonry and Jews was also a point of interest and masonic witnesses were cited. The plaintiffs nominated these witnesses and paid a considerable amount to the Court to make the appearance of those important eyewitnesses possible, among them also Chaim Weizmann, the future first president of the state of Israel. The only witness nominated by the defendants was Alfred Zander, Zurich, who wrote some articles on the Protocols of the Elders of Zion in the newspaper [...] "Der eiserne Besen" [...] (Rod of Iron) of the National Front.|$|R

50|$|Despite being a minor party, the NIP {{registered}} {{one of the}} few {{occurrences of}} a far-right party securing electoral office in Britain before the 1990s. In 1974, Michael Coney, a local sub-post office manager, stood as NIP candidate for the South Tottenham ward of Haringey London Borough Council and as part of his campaign he appealed to the area's Jewish population not to vote on religious lines due to the Labour Party candidate, Aaron Weichselbaum, being Jewish. Leaders in the local Jewish community interpreted this as an attempt by Coney to whip up <b>anti-Semitic</b> <b>feelings</b> against Weichselbaum and, whilst another Labour candidate was elected in what was a safe seat, Weichselbaum was defeated by Coney. Coney was independent by the 1978 elections (the NIP having been wound up in the interim) and later served the Conservative Party but his example of building a strong local base in a single area, which included a 20.3% vote share in the 1973 Greater London Council election, was later lauded by elements within the British National Party who supported Nick Griffin against John Tyndall due to their support for a similar localist strategy.|$|R

Płońsk was remarkably free of it ... Nevertheless, and I think this very significant, it was Płońsk that sent the highest proportion of Jews to Eretz Israel from any town in Poland of comparable size. We emigrated not for negative reasons of escape but for the positive purpose of rebuilding a homeland ... Life in Płońsk was peaceful enough. There were three main communities: Russians, Jews and Poles. ... The number of Jews and Poles in the city were roughly equal, about five thousand each. The Jews, however, formed a compact, centralized group occupying the innermost districts whilst the Poles were more scattered, living in outlying areas and shading off into the peasantry. Consequently, when a gang of Jewish boys met a Polish gang the latter would almost inevitably represent a single suburb and thus be poorer in fighting potential than the Jews who even if their numbers were initially fewer could quickly call on reinforcements from the entire quarter. Far from being afraid of them, they were rather afraid of us. In general, however, relations were amicable, though distant." ...|$|R

50|$|The Hilsner Affair {{became a}} focal point of {{controversy}} in Czech history in 1899 and 1900, and this affair ultimately led to Masaryk’s creation of the Czech Realist Party. Leopold Hilsner, a Jewish vagrant, was accused of murdering Anežka Hrůzová, a Czech Catholic girl, {{even though there was}} little substantial evidence proving his guilt. Much of the nationalist press began to portray the murder as a ritual killing in order to create <b>anti-Semitic</b> <b>feeling</b> throughout the country. Masaryk believed he should defend Hilsner so that he could demonstrate his own personal beliefs. His defense led Emperor Francis Joseph to change Hilsner’s sentence from execution to lifelong imprisonment. After Masaryk led to the lessening of Hilsner’s sentence, many Czech nationalists denounced Masaryk’s choice to defend Hilsner and his belief that ethics applied to both nationalism and personal behavior. Masaryk became more critical on both the Young Czechs and the Old Czechs which led to his break from them. Masaryk collaborated with Karel Kramář and a few others in creating the Czech Realist Party which relatively soon after its creation merged with members of the Radical Progressive Party. The party became known as the Radical Progressive Party in 1905 but its members were still viewed as realists.|$|R
