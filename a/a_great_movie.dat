5|$|The film {{is based}} on the real life of Ron Woodroof, a patient of HIV and AIDS, who {{was the subject of a}} lengthy 1992 article in The Dallas Morning News written by {{journalist}} and author Bill Minutaglio. A month before Woodroof died in September 1992, screenwriter Craig Borten was told about the story by his friend, so he went and interviewed him to create the screenplay; Borten recorded many hours of interviews with Woodroof and had access to his personal journals. Borten wrote a script for what he believed would make <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>movie</b> and attempted to attract interest in making the film in mid 1996, with Dennis Hopper attached to direct. Columbia Pictures was set to buy the script but the film was unable to secure financial backing.|$|E
500|$|Scott Meslow of The Atlantic stated while Titanic {{initially}} {{seems to}} need no defense, given its success, {{it is considered}} a film [...] "for 15-year-old girls" [...] by its main detractors. He argued that dismissing Titanic as fodder for 15-year-old girls fails to consider the film's accomplishment: [...] "that [...] grandiose, 3+ hour historical romantic drama is a film for everyone—including teenage boys." [...] Meslow stated that despite the film being ranked high by males {{under the age of}} 18, matching the ratings for teenage boy-targeted films like Iron Man, it is common for boys and men to deny liking Titanic. He acknowledged his own rejection of the film as a child while secretly loving it. [...] "It's this collection of elements—the history, the romance, the action—that made (and continues to make) Titanic an irresistible proposition for audiences of all ages across the globe," [...] he stated. [...] "Titanic has flaws, but for all its legacy, it's better than its middlebrow reputation would have you believe. It's <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>movie</b> for 15-year-old girls, but that doesn't mean it's not <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>movie</b> for everyone else too." ...|$|E

The consensus reads: [...] "One {{of the most influential}} of all teen films, American Graffiti is a funny, nostalgic, and bittersweet look at a group of recent high school grads' last days of innocence." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film a full four stars and praised it for being [...] "not only <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>movie</b> but a brilliant work of historical fiction; no sociological treatise could duplicate the movie's success in remembering exactly how it was to be alive at that cultural instant".|$|E

Screenwriter Michael Goldenberg {{described}} his task to cut down the novel as searching for [...] "the best equivalent way to tell the story. My job was to stay true {{to the spirit of}} the book, rather than to the letter". Goldenberg said that Rowling told him, the producers, and Yates that [...] "she just wanted to see <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>movie,</b> and gave [...] permission to take whatever liberties [...] felt [...] needed to take to translate the book into a movie she would love". Cutting down the book to meet the time frame of the film, Goldenberg explained, became [...] "clearer when [...] figured out that the organising principle of the screenplay was to narrate Harry's emotional journey". He and Yates [...] "looked for every opportunity to get everything [...] could in there. And where [...] couldn't, to sort of pay homage to it, to have it somewhere in the background or to feel like it could be taking place off-screen".|$|E

5000|$|John Ajvide Lindqvist, {{author of}} Let the Right One In, who also wrote the {{screenplay}} {{for the original}} Swedish film, was pleased with Let Me In. He said: I might just be the luckiest writer alive. To have not only one, but two excellent versions of my debut novel done for the screen feels unreal. Let the Right One In is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> Swedish <b>movie.</b> Let Me In is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> American <b>movie.</b> There are notable similarities {{and the spirit of}} Tomas Alfredson is present. But Let Me In puts the emotional pressure in different places and stands firmly on its own legs. Like the Swedish movie it made me cry, but not at the same points. Let Me In is a dark and violent love story, a beautiful piece of cinema and a respectful rendering of my novel for which I am grateful. Again.|$|R

500|$|Reviews for the Saturn and PlayStation ports {{were mostly}} {{positive}} although some were mixed. Sam Hickman from the Sega Saturn Magazine {{commented that the}} game manages to be extremely creepy and terrifying despite having almost no bloodshed. He predicted that the game would be outclassed by Resident Evil (still in development {{at the time of}} the review), but concluded that D was the best horror game presently on the market. Four reviewers at Electronic Gaming Monthly commented that the Saturn version had reduced the load times seen in the 3DO version to almost nothing. They highly praised the storyline and intelligently designed puzzles, and described it as [...] "scary enough to make you an insomniac." [...] GamePro staff gave positive reviews for both the Saturn and PlayStation versions, recommending it to those looking for a horror experience. Maximum staff likewise gave positive reviews to both versions, saying that D is similar to Myst (1993) and Mansion of Hidden Souls (1993) but ultimately better due to its more enticing story. They also praised the FMV graphics and cinematic presentation, but criticized it for its lack of longevity. The reviewers felt its short length, addictive gameplay, and lack of overly challenging puzzles ensured that the player will be finished with it very quickly. A Next Generation reviewer gave the same praises for the scary storyline and graphics, and also said the puzzles [...] "are just challenging enough to satisfy and yet not so difficult as to impede your progress for very long." [...] However, he felt the slow character movement and lack of longevity kept the game from being truly exceptional. Staff at Game Informer were more critical in their review of the Saturn version. They found the gameplay tedious but did praise the graphics and the storytelling, concluding the [...] "story would make <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>movie</b> or book, but not a game." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing in Time, Richard Schickel said, [...] "I'm {{not going}} to argue that Valkyrie is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>movie.</b> But in its way it is a {{thoughtful}} and entertaining one, especially {{in comparison with the}} pomp and pretentiousness of most of the competition this holiday season." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe described the film: [...] "It's a smooth, compelling, almost suspenseful ... and slightly hollow Hollywood period piece—a World War II action-drama in which an intriguing (but not electrifying) star performance is buttressed by stellar support." [...] Burr analyzed Cruise's performance: [...] "... his Claus von Stauffenberg is an honorable conception that's ultimately too thin to fully rise up from the pages of history. This story deserves to be told, but for reasons best known to himself, the star has latched onto a strictly Nietzschean interpretation that he rides into the ground." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today thought of Cruise as [...] "unconvincing and stiff as the disenchanted" [...] von Stauffenberg. She felt that the film started slowly and that [...] "even during scenes of intense action, the visually slick production is only minimally engrossing". She concluded of the film's overall pace, [...] "The action becomes more engrossing during the film's second half, but one expects more depth and nuance, given its pedigree." [...] Anthony Lane of The New Yorker wrote, [...] " [...] carries the movie, although, once you dig beneath the uniform, there isn’t much for him to get a handle on; the fascination with Stauffenberg resides in what he did, not in who he was." [...] Lane thought that there was [...] "too much" [...] character acting of the British veteran actors and felt of the casting of Nighy, Stamp, and Wilkinson, [...] "These men are meant to be battle-toughened Nazi officers, but what we get is an array of discreetly amusing studies in mild neurosis." ...|$|E
500|$|The Haunting {{opened to}} mixed reception, the {{consensus}} generally being {{that it was}} a stylish film but had major flaws in the plot and lacked excitement. Variety called the acting effective, Davis Boulton's cinematography extraordinarily dexterous and visually exciting, and Elliott Scott's production design of the [...] "monstrous" [...] house most decidedly the star of the film. However, the unnamed reviewer felt Gidding's screenplay had [...] "major shortcomings" [...] in that the plot was incomprehensible at points, and the motivation for the characters was poor. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times cited The Haunting as [...] "one of the most highly regarded haunted house films ever produced" [...] but surmised that [...] "there is really no point to it". Writing in The Atlantic magazine, critic Pauline Kael called the film [...] "moderately elegant and literate and expensive", but criticised Russ Tamblyn for being [...] "feeble [...] cowardly-comic". She considered the film to be superior to Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, also released in 1963, yet didn't consider it to be a great film. Kael said of it, [...] "It wasn't <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>movie</b> but I certainly wouldn't have thought that it could offend anyone. Yet part of the audience at The Haunting wasn't merely bored, it was hostile—as if the movie, by assuming interests they didn't have, made them feel resentful or inferior. I've never felt this in an audience toward crude, bad movies… But the few scattered people at The Haunting were restless and talkative, the couple sitting near me arguing—the man threatening to leave, the woman assuring him that something would happen. In their terms, they were cheated: nothing happened. And, of course, they missed what was happening all along, perhaps because of nervous impatience or a primitive notion that the real things are physical." ...|$|E

5000|$|Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "Playful, absurd and endearingly inventive, this unstoppably amusing feature reminds us why Britain's Aardman Animations is {{a mainstay of}} the current cartooning golden age." [...] Peter Keough of The Boston Globe gave the film {{three and a half}} stars out of four, saying [...] "Like <b>a</b> <b>great</b> silent <b>movie,</b> it creates its pathos and comedy out of the concrete objects being animated, building elaborate gags involving everyday items transformed into Rube Goldberg devices." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{computer}} animation {{used throughout the}} film was more complex than anything DreamWorks had done before. When the head of production handed the script to VFX Supervisor Markus Manninen, she reportedly laughed and wished him [...] "good luck". [...] "When we started talking," [...] said Manninen, [...] "the movie was still a high concept. But for everyone that looked at it, it screamed complexity. We launched off saying, how can you make this movie tangible? How can you find smart ways to bring this world to life {{in a way that}} makes it <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>movie</b> and not feel like the complexity becomes the driver of the story, but the story and the emotion being the driver?" [...] In preparation, the animators took a six-hour kung fu class.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the period}} of filming, Murray {{was in the midst}} of marital {{problems}} and several crew reported his attitude as erratic. Murray had wanted to make the film less of a comedy as to make it more contemplative, against Ramis' own direction to keep it as a comedy. Rather than to handle Murray's constant phone calls, Ramis had Murray work with Rubin in New York City directly to adjust the script to satisfy Murray's requests. Actor Stephen Tobolowsky described the script changes: [...] "When I got the part, it was still kind of a mediocre Bill Murray movie," [...] he said. [...] "You know, Bill Murray, with no consequences, in comic situations ... It wasn’t until we got into the shooting that everything turned on its head. And it became not only a good movie, not only <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>movie,</b> but a classic." ...|$|E

With his snowy white hair and moustache to match, Hanks conveys a man confident in his abilities, yet humble in his actions, which could also be said of Eastwood as a director." [...] IGN reviewer Simon Thompson awarded 9/10, writing: [...] "Sully is a beautifully balanced, classily nuanced and hugely engaging film that avoids all the clichéd pitfalls it could have slipped into. Tom Hanks gives {{one of the best}} performances of his career and Clint Eastwood's direction is beautiful and rich. It's not just <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>movie,</b> Sully {{is one of the best}} pieces of cinema that a major Hollywood studio has released this year."

Joseph Savitski from Beyond Hollywood.com gave the film a {{negative}} review, stating, [...] "Garuda had potential to be <b>a</b> <b>great</b> monster <b>movie.</b> Most of the film’s faults {{can be attributed to}} oftentimes sloppy direction and editing by the writer/director, whose own script barely makes any sense. This is too bad, because “Garuda” has decent special effects, as well as an appealing female lead in Sara Legge. Unfortunately, like most monster movies, “Garuda” ends up treading formula instead of creating new ones, resulting in a film that doesn’t stand out from the crowd".|$|R

It is overwhelming, spellbinding; at first dreamlike, and then hallucinatory." [...] Roger Ebert has added it to his list of The Great Movies, and in a 2002 Sight & Sound poll of critics and filmmakers on the best films ever made, Ebert listed it in his top ten. In the same poll, critic Nigel Andrews and director Santosh Sivan also placed it in their top ten list. In 1999, Rolling Stone included the film on the magazine's [...] "100 Maverick Movies of the Last 100 Years" [...] list. Aguirre was included in Time Magazines [...] "All Time 100 Best Films", compiled by Richard Schickel and Richard Corliss. Entertainment Weekly named it the 46th greatest cult film ever made.

2500|$|Reviews in the {{conservative}} press were more mixed. American economist Mark Skousen praised the film, writing in Human Events, [...] "The script is true to the philosophy of Ayn Rand's novel." [...] The Weekly Standard senior editor Fred Barnes noted that the film [...] "gets Rand's point across forcefully without too much pounding", that it is [...] "fast-paced" [...] {{when compared with the}} original novel's 1200-page length, and that it is [...] "at least as relevant today as it was when the novel was published in 1957." [...] Jack Hunter, contributing editor to The American Conservative, wrote, [...] "If you ask the average film critic about the new movie adaptation of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged they will tell you it is a horrible movie. If you ask the average conservative or libertarian they will tell you it is <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>movie.</b> Objectively, it is a mediocre movie at best. Subjectively, {{it is one of the}} best mediocre movies you'll ever see." [...] In the National Post, Peter Foster credited the movie for the daunting job of fidelity to the novel, wryly suggested a plot rewrite along the lines of comparable current events, and concluded, [...] "if it sinks without trace, its backers should at least be proud that they lost their own money." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pete Vonder Haar of the Film Threat {{gave the}} film a mixed review, stating: [...] "It's a {{reasonably}} entertaining actioner, and Zwick doesn't {{shy away from}} depicting violence or the horrors of war, but as a social statement it falls a little short.

[...] Marc Savlov of the Austin Chronicle also gave the film a mixed review, he stated: [...] "While the film never quite reaches the emotional peaks it so obviously seeks to scale, Zwick's film is still potent enough to save you three months salary." [...] Nathan Lee of the Village Voice, like Vonder Haar and Savlov, also gave the film a mixed review, stating that [...] "De Beers can relax; the only indignation stirred up by Blood Diamond won't be among those who worry about where their jewelry came from, but with audiences incensed by facile politics and bad storytelling." [...] Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club gave the film [...] "C", he stated: [...] "Much like Zwick's Glory and The Last Samurai, Blood Diamond strives to be an [...] "important" [...] film while stopping well short of being genuinely provocative and artistically chancy." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film a negative review, stating that [...] "director Edward Zwick tried to make <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>movie,</b> but somewhere in the process he forgot {{to make a good}} one." ...|$|E
