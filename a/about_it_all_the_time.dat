500|$|After Hershiser reached 49 {{consecutive}} innings {{because of}} what some sources describe as an umpire's favorable interference ruling on a double play, the sports media compared him to Drysdale, who had a similar incident occur during his streak. The Houston Chronicle noted that both beneficial calls were in Dodgers–Giants games. However, the press also noted that Hershiser needed another complete game shutout to tie Drysdale and pass Johnson on the all-time consecutive scoreless innings list. In addition to covering the record pursuit, some sportswriters perceived that Hershiser had taken a commanding lead in the Cy Young Award race. Despite the official ruling by MLB statistician Seymour Siwoff that only full innings of starting pitchers count toward the record, some of the press continued {{to refer to the}} record as [...] innings. The pennant race also continued to draw attention as the Dodgers closed in on the NL West division title. An Associated Press article noted that it was Hershiser's eighth consecutive complete game and fifteenth of the season and Hershiser's fifth consecutive complete game shutout. As Hershiser's last remaining start approached, the media mentioned that he needed one more complete game shutout to tie the all-time record. When the total reached 49, Hershiser first began to feel that the record was within reach. Not only were his teammates too superstitious {{to talk to him about}} the streak, Dodgers announcer Drysdale also avoided the subject when talking to Hershiser for fear of jinxing him. Hershiser was not superstitious about the record, saying, [...] "I'm pretty loosey-goosey about it... I talk <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> I'm not superstitious." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anthony Kiedis {{was asked}} in a December 2016 {{interview}} if he ever plans to retire {{and he said that}} he expects to be writing music until the day he dies. [...] "We might always be writing music, writing songs...I can't imagine that going away. I want to write a song today, tomorrow. That's quite a satisfying thing to do. I think <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> there's so many things that I want to sing, melodies, and lyrics. So, if you have people you want to work with for a lifetime, there's no reason you can't write songs until the day you die." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{unlikely}} romance was scripted into Mel's narrative {{when she}} began dating her boss Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). The pairing {{has been described as}} one of [...] "the most unbelievable soap couples", but Outwaite defended it in 1999, saying [...] "I know I've fancied some not particularly attractive men in my time, but I don't think Ian is actually ugly. He has a vulnerable side and that's what is attractive. When he is being all hot-headed and gets above himself then I personally don't like Ian. But when he is being vulnerable I can see the attraction. People talk to me <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> I have taxi drivers telling me I could do much better than Ian. The other day someone shouted that I should go back with [...] Steve Owen. It's incredible, they'd rather [...] went out with [...] a murderer than with [...] a hard-working father raising three children." [...] Their relationship was the focus of the storyline that aired to mark the Millennium celebrations, when Ian emotionally blackmailed Mel into marrying him by claiming that his daughter was dying of cancer; storylines {{in the latter part of}} 1999 focused on the build-up to a joint Millennium wedding on New Year's Eve 1999 with Barry (Shaun Williamson) and Natalie Evans (Lucy Speed). The wedding went as planned; however, Mel and Ian's marriage ended hours later as the clock struck midnight to signify the beginning of the New Year after Mel discovered Ian's lie. The Millennium Eve episodes drew in 20.89 million viewers – the biggest soap audience since the character Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon) was killed off in EastEnders precisely one year earlier (New Year's Eve 1998). An EastEnders spokeswoman commented: [...] "This is a remarkable endorsement of the power of EastEnders that over 20 million viewers chose to see the Millennium celebrations in Albert Square." [...] The episodes were also broadcast on screens in London's Trafalgar Square, a typical “haunt for New Year's Eve revelers”.|$|E

6000|$|Constellations {{have always}} been {{troublesome}} things to name. If you give {{one of them a}} fanciful name, it will always refuse to live up to it; it will always persist in not resembling the thing it has been named for. Ultimately, to satisfy the public, the fanciful name has to be discarded for a common-sense one, a manifestly descriptive one. The Great Bear remained the Great Bear--and unrecognizable as such--for thousands of years; and people complained <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> and quite properly; but as soon as it became the property of the United States, Congress changed it to the Big Dipper, and now every body is satisfied, and there is no more talk about riots. I would not change the Southern Cross to the Southern Coffin, I would change it to the Southern Kite; for up there in the general emptiness is the proper home of a kite, but not for coffins and crosses and dippers. In a little while, now--I cannot tell exactly how long it will be--the globe will belong to the English-speaking race; and of course the skies also. Then the constellations will be re-organized, and polished up, and re-named--the most of them [...] "Victoria," [...] I reckon, but this one will sail thereafter as the Southern Kite, or go out of business. Several towns and things, here and there, have been named for Her Majesty already.|$|E
