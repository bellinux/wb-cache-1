40|$|At present {{more than}} 90 per {{cent of the}} world's alumina is {{produced}} by the Bayer process, a simple technology providing high purity final product. A part from some exceptional local conditions, bauxite is processed almost solely by this technology. As a benefication process, alumina production releases the aluminum oxide content of bauxite from other accompanying oxides thus providing alumina suitable for electrolysis in a cryolite melt. The basic theory of the Bayer process was elaborated by K. J. Bayer and described in his patents in 1887 and 1892. The first patent refers {{to the aid of}} seed crystals of aluminum hydroxide or of carbonic acid, that is, to the precipitation and carbonation processes. The second patent formulates the concept that the aluminum oxide content of bauxites can be dissolved in sodium hydroxide solutions, with the formulation of sodium aluminate, a process called digestion nowadays. The most important operations of the Bayer technology are bauxite preparation, crushing, grinding, digestion, red mud separation, thickening, washing, filtration, precipitation, calcination and evaporation.

The use of ethanol (molar ratio of 3 : 1 of ethanol:triglycerides) instead of methanol was evaluated in all processes. An alkali-based process resulted in rapid conversion of the triglycerides in the coconut oil to esters with an 80 % conversion in 5 - 10 min. However pre-treatment with 0. 7 % H 2 SO 4 v/v at 50 oC for 3 h was required before alkali addition to avoid saponification of the free fatty acids. By comparison, a longer reaction time (50 h) was required for the acid process which also resulted in a lower conversion (67 % at 50 oC). The use of an acid overcomes {{the limitations of the}} <b>alkali</b> <b>process</b> of saponification when high FFA content oils are used, and gave a higher conversion 70 % at 75 oC after 300 min. By comparison use of an enzymatic (lipase) catalyst (1 % w/v) at 50 oC resulted in a conversion of 80 % in 50 h. The enzyme based process under similar conditions was significantly improved by the use of high frequency sonication which reduced the reaction time to 3 h and achieved a 92 % conversion of triglycerides to esters. To further improve the economics of the enzyme process, an initial study showed that the enzyme catalyst was able to be recycled with only a 20 % decrease in conversion. The use of the glycerol by-product from the enzyme process as a carbon source for yeast growth resulted in improved kinetics to that for yeast growth on pure glycerol indicating that no inhibitory by-products were produced during the enzyme process.

Enzymes have several advantages over chemical catalysts such as mild reaction conditions,high specificity,and renewability. The production of biodiesel using a biocatalyst eliminates the disadvantages of the <b>alkali</b> <b>process</b> by producing a product of very high purity.

In this study, a novel combined pretreatment with white-rot fungus and alkali at near room-temperature for saccharification of corn stalks was investigated {{to speed up the}} biological process. Biological pretreatment with Irpex lacteus or Echinodontium taxodii can improve enzymatic hydrolysis of corn stalk greatly, but the process requires a long time (60 days) to achieve a satisfactory sugar yield. The combination processes with the fungi were compared with the sole pretreatments. The results showed that the time of the biological process could be shortened to 15 days when the bio-treatment with I. lacteus was combined with alkali pretreatment. The efficiency of alkali pretreatment can be also enhanced significantly by biological treatment. 271. 1 mg/g of final glucose yield was obtained for the combination pretreatment, which was an improvement of 50. 4 % and 28. 3 % in comparison with the sole alkali pretreatment at the same and optimum reaction time, respectively. In conclusion, the combination of biological pretreatment with <b>alkali</b> <b>processes</b> not only speeded up the biological process, but also improved the sugar yield in comparison to the sole pretreatment and is favorable for the development of biological pretreatment...|$|R
40|$|Fish heads {{contain a}} good amount of protein which can be {{extracted}} and used as a functional ingredient in fish products. Like other muscle proteins, fish head protein is composed of the myofibrillar proteins of myosin, actin, tropomyosin and others. Under favourable conditions these proteins, mostly myosin, form a gel network, which is important for a product texture. Hoki and barracouta are abundant in New Zealand. Hoki has great commercial value, but barracouta has a limited use as a fish product due its undesirable dark muscle and bony structure. Both fish muscles are consumed fresh or processed, but the heads are converted to fertiliser. There is no technology currently available which can extract the protein from fish heads for use in a consumer product. It was not possible to make surimi from the fish heads as surimi is mainly produced from fresh white fish muscle. An alternative was to extract the protein from fish heads by a pH shifting process. After a review of literature in order to study the protein extraction process by the pH shifting method, a series of initial trials were carried out with hoki head mince. On the basis of the initial trials, further improvements were made in the process in order to increase the protein yield. It was found that the usual pH shifting process extracted only a small proportion of the protein from the fish heads. To increase the yield the process was modified by introducing a high temperature extraction at 80 ° C for one hour step. Once a desirable amount of protein was recovered the same processes were used to extract protein from barracouta. The extracted protein was dried and stored for further experiments. Gels were prepared from the dried protein powder and the properties of the gels were evaluated by texture profile analysis and cooking loss. It was found that the <b>alkali</b> <b>process</b> resulted in a significantly higher yield and the extracted protein gave stronger gels with a decreased cooking loss compared to the acid process and control hoki fillet protein powders. The extracted protein can be added to other fish mince in order to make consumer products and a complete sensory study {{needs to be done in}} order to investigate the consumer acceptability.
