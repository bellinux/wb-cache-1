25|$|Keaton is a 1964 {{graduate}} of Santa Ana High School in Santa Ana, California. During her time there, she participated in singing and acting clubs at school, and starred as Blanche DuBois {{in a school}} production of A Streetcar Named Desire. After graduation, she attended Santa Ana College, and later Orange Coast College as an acting student, but dropped out after a year to pursue an entertainment career in Manhattan. Upon joining the Actors' Equity Association, she changed her surname to Keaton, her mother's maiden name, as there was already an actress registered {{under the name of}} Diane Hall. For a brief time, she also moonlighted at nightclubs with a singing act. She would later revisit her nightclub act in Annie Hall (1977) and <b>And</b> <b>So</b> <b>It</b> <b>Goes</b> (2014), and a cameo in Radio Days (1987).|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Fight the Fight" [...] {{from the}} show was {{recorded}} and released by Michael Ball {{as part of his}} Both Sides Now album in February 2013. The same track was later released as a digital download in December 2013, sung by Robert Lonsdale. In July 2013, Rice allowed Clare Teal to record another song {{from the show}}, [...] "Another Language", for release on her album <b>And</b> <b>So</b> <b>It</b> <b>Goes.</b> In February 2014, Rice announced that a cast album would be recorded, prior to the show's West End closure. The original London cast recording was released as a digital download on 3 July 2014, with the physical release following on 4 August.|$|E

500|$|Kurt Vonnegut has {{inspired}} numerous posthumous tributes and works. In 2008, the Kurt Vonnegut Society was established, and in November 2010, the Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library was opened in Vonnegut's hometown of Indianapolis. The Library of America published {{a compendium of}} Vonnegut's compositions between 1963 and 1973 the following April, and another compendium of his earlier works in 2012. Late 2011 saw the release of two Vonnegut biographies, Gregory Sumner's Unstuck in Time and Charles J. Shields's <b>And</b> <b>So</b> <b>It</b> <b>Goes.</b> Shields's biography of Vonnegut created some controversy. According to The Guardian, the book portrays Vonnegut as distant, cruel and nasty. [...] "Cruel, nasty and scary are the adjectives commonly used to describe him by the friends, colleagues, and relatives Shields quotes", said The Daily Beasts Wendy Smith. [...] "Towards the end he was very feeble, very depressed and almost morose", said Jerome Klinkowitz of the University of Northern Iowa, who has examined Vonnegut in depth.|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, Keaton {{starred in}} <b>And</b> <b>So</b> <b>It</b> <b>Goes</b> and 5 Flights Up. In Rob Reiner's romantic dramedy <b>And</b> <b>So</b> <b>It</b> <b>Goes,</b> Keaton portrayed a widowed lounge singer, who finds autumnal {{love with a}} bad boy, played by Michael Douglas. The film {{received}} largely negative reviews from critics, who felt that [...] "And So It Goes aims for comedy, but with two talented actors stuck in a half-hearted effort from a once-mighty filmmaker, it ends in unintentional tragedy." [...] Keaton co-starred with Morgan Freeman in Richard Loncraine's comedy film 5 Flights Up. Based on the novel Heroic Measures by Jill Ciment, they play a long-married couple who have an eventful weekend after {{they are forced to}} contemplate selling their beloved Brooklyn apartment. Shot in New York, the film premiered, under its former name Ruth & Alex, at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. The same year, Keaton became the first woman to receive the Golden Lion Award from the Zurich Film Festival.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with China Central Television (CCTV) on 12 June 2005, Lee stressed {{the need to have}} a continuous renewal of talent in the country's leadership, saying:"In a different world we need to find a niche for ourselves, little corners where in spite of our small size we can perform a role which will be useful to the world. To do that, you will need people at the top, decision-makers who have got foresight, good minds, who are open to ideas, who can seize opportunities like we did... My job really was to find my successors. I found them, they are there; their job is to find their successors. So there must be this continuous renewal of talented, dedicated, honest, able people who will do things not for themselves but for their people and for their country. If they can do that, they will carry on for another one generation <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> on. The moment that breaks, it's gone." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> until May 12, 2008 â€” when Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents {{conducted}} {{a raid on}} AgriProcessors, arresting almost 400 undocumented workers.|$|R
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> on till on {{the steps}} was seen in full light among the boys, Uncle Reginald, ready to lift every one out with a kiss.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes,</b> {{little family}} {{differences}} {{for the most}} part, which, if left unsettled would result finally in greater factional strife, and the eventual dismemberment of the tribe.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, when we {{blow the}} bellows, we press {{the two sides}} together, and that presses the wind out. It can't {{go out of the}} hole whence it came in, because the clapper stops it up, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> out the long nose, right into the fire, and makes the fire burn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{there they}} go--orf! And {{we never see}} them again! <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> on! So it goes on! We don't know nobody and we shan't know anybody! And you won't put {{yourself}} out not a little bit, or take the trouble to find out anything 'ow {{it ought to be}} done." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>AND</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> {{on for a}} fortnight; till a big {{wind blew}} {{off the top of}} the tree, and opened up the hole and let in the rain.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>went,</b> until Frederick wondered, {{when he came}} to die, {{if there}} was one man in the county, much less in the {{adjoining}} county, who would come to him at his bedside.|$|R

6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> on. I {{will not}} {{continue}} the stanza, {{because it contains}} the worst rhyme that Thackeray ever permitted himself to use. The Chronicle of the Drum has not the finish which he achieved afterwards, but {{it is full of}} national feeling, and carries on its purpose to the end with an admirable persistency; ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{the band}} strike up again, and the {{whirling}} dance renews its vortex; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> on, from hour to hour, till {{two or three}} in the morning. Not that we staid till then; we saw all we wanted to see, and left by eleven. But it is a scene perfectly unearthly, or rather perfectly Parisian, and just as earthly as possible; yet a scene where earthliness is worked up into a style of sublimation the most exquisite conceivable.|$|E
6000|$|... 'True,' cried Jem, who, {{having taken}} no {{previous}} notice of her, had at first on her speaking bent his brows {{on her as}} if to extend to her the storm he was inflicting on poor, defenceless Lord Ormersfield, 'he is thought soft because of his easy way; but {{come to the point}} where harm displays itself, you can't move him a step farther--though he hangs back in such a quiet, careless fashion, that it seems as if he was only tired of the whole concern, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> down again as changeableness.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Was {{there ever}} {{such a man}} since Odin trod the earth?" [...] <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> on, till the serving-women laughed {{at the old man}} in love and the wit of her that mocked him.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> on. By {{three o'clock}} {{we found it}} was no use, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> we got up and played cribbage and smoked pipes till sunrise. It was my week to cook. I always hated cooking--now, I abhorred it.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> always <b>and</b> forever. The cowboys {{could not}} help that. It was born in them, born of the {{atmosphere}} and spirit of the singular life they lived. Nevertheless Pan loved them, and they were good to him.|$|R
60|$|Poor little tender heart! <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> on hoping and beating, {{and longing}} and trusting. You {{see it is}} {{not much of a}} life to describe. There is not much of what you call {{incident}} in it. Only one feeling all day--when will he come? only one thought to sleep and wake upon. I believe George was playing billiards with Captain Cannon in Swallow Street at the time when Amelia was asking Captain Dobbin about him; for George was a jolly sociable fellow, and excellent in all games of skill.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> {{plunging}} through {{court and}} corridor; billowing uncontrollable, firing from windows--on itself: in hot frenzy of triumph, {{of grief and}} vengeance for its slain. The poor Invalides will fare ill; one Swiss, running off in his white smock, is driven back, with a death-thrust. Let all prisoners be marched to the Townhall, to be judged!--Alas, already one poor Invalide has his right hand slashed off him; his maimed body dragged to the Place de Greve, and hanged there. This same right hand, it is said, turned back de Launay from the Powder-Magazine, and saved Paris.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I didn't {{really put}} {{him out of the}} world with my own paws; but I led him into a trap where Mr. Man found him later, and if that isn't the same as killing him I'd like to know what it is? Mrs. Bunny is forever wanting carrots; if her head aches, there's nothing to be done but get young carrots, when they're in season, I mean. If she gets nervous about Sonny Bunny, then the only thing to {{straighten}} her out is a bunch of carrots, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> on all the time, till I'm actually worn down to skin and bones ministering to her whims.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>went,</b> {{fifteen seconds}} <b>and</b> thirty days to each hobo. The machine of justice was {{grinding}} smoothly. Most likely, considering how early {{it was in}} the morning, his Honor had not yet had his breakfast and was in a hurry.|$|R
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> on <b>and</b> on {{that summer}} afternoon, in the deserted room meant for such other things, {{where the two}} Frenchmen were too sympathetic, and the old {{official}} too drowsy, to come. Then it all narrowed to one fierce, insistent question: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> continued, only {{growing more}} intense in blue and sunlight, all day. After breakfast, I {{came in from}} the well under {{strawberry}} bed, to say I {{had never seen anything like}} <b>it,</b> <b>so</b> pure or intense, in Italy; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> glowing on, cloudless, with soft north wind, all day.|$|R
60|$|But {{it is not}} for us {{to settle}} such {{disputes}} of scholars. Meanwhile their evidence is derived from their private interpretations of old proper names, and they differ among themselves as to whether, in such interpretations, they should or should not be governed strictly by phonetic laws. Then what Mr. Max Muller calls 'the usual bickerings' begin among scholars (i. 416). And Mr. Max Muller connects Ouranos with Vedic Varuna, while Wackernagel prefers to derive it from [Greek], urine, and this from [Greek]=Sk. Varshayami, to rain (ii. 416, 417), <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> on for years with a glorious uncertainty. If Mr. Max Muller's equations are scientifically correct, the scholars who accept them not must all be unscientific. Or else, this is not science at all.|$|E
60|$|What {{is to be}} {{done about}} this we don't know. What would you do about it? Would you let the {{squirrels}} live in your house or not? When our good people come down of a cold winter morning, and see the squirrels dancing and frisking down the trees, and chasing each other so merrily over the garden chair between them, or sitting with their tails saucily over their backs, they look so jolly and jaunty and pretty that they almost forgive them for disturbing their night's rest, and think that they will not do anything to drive them out of the garret to-day. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> on; but how long the squirrels will rent the cottage in this fashion, I'm sure I dare not undertake to say.|$|E
6000|$|My chief, you do but echo back my thoughts: This {{competition}} {{is the death}} of trade. 'Tis plain (unless we wish to go to work) Some other business we must early find. What shall it be? The field of usefulness Is yearly narrowing with the advance Of wealth and population on this coast. There's little left that any man can do Without some other fellow stepping in And doing it as well. If one essay To pick a pocket he is sure to feel (With what disgust I need not say to you) Another hand inserted in the same. You crack a crib at dead of night, and lo! As you explore the dining-room for plate You find, in session there, a graceless band Stuffing their coats with spoons, their skins with wine. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes.</b> Why even undertake To salt a mine {{and you will find}} it rich With noble specimens placed there before! ...|$|E
60|$|As he spoke, Hall of Lithdale came, {{and with}} him Koll the Half-witted, <b>and</b> others. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> on till all the men whom Eric and Skallagrim had slain, or who had died because of them, or at their side, were {{gathered}} in deep ranks before them.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, sir, I {{was always}} hoping that I could turn them right again, {{so as you}} wouldn't need to be troubled at all. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>went</b> {{from bad to worse}} until we find {{ourselves}} here.

6000|$|... "To be sure, greenie! Why not? Precious fun it was {{in those}} times.
