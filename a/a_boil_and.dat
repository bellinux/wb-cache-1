25|$|Variations on {{the flavor}} are gained by adding root {{vegetables}} such as parsnip, potato, sweet potato and celery root, herbs such as parsley, dill, other vegetables such as zucchini, whole garlic cloves or tomatoes and black pepper. The soup {{should be brought}} slowly to <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> <b>and</b> then simmered in a covered pot on a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. A clearer broth is achieved by skimming the drops of fat {{off the top of}} the soup as it is cooking, first bringing the chicken to boil from a pot of cold water and discarding the water before continuing, or straining it through a strainer or cheesecloth. Saffron or turmeric are sometimes added as a yellow colorant. Then, the chicken can be shredded by hand and stored in the refrigerator until ready for use in the soup.|$|E
500|$|Raw {{ground beef}} is crumbled in water and/or stock, tomato paste and {{seasonings}} are added, and {{the mixture is}} brought to <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> <b>and</b> then simmered for several hours to form a thin meat sauce. Many recipes call for an overnight chill in the refrigerator to allow for easy skimming of fat and to allow flavors to develop, then reheating to serve. Typical proportions are 2 pounds of ground beef to [...] 4 cups of water and 6 oz tomato paste to make 8 servings.|$|E

50|$|In the 7th century, Jainism {{was one of}} {{the major}} {{religions}} in South India.

After this, the king became a Shaivite, and several of his subjects converted to Shaivism during his rule.
