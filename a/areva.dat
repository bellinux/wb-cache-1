Tyson Gay soundly defeated him with a run of 9.84 to Bolt's 9.97 seconds, and the Jamaican reflected that he had slacked off in training early in the season while Gay had been better prepared and in a better condition. This marked Bolt's first loss to Gay in the 100 m, which coincidentally occurred in the same stadium where Powell had beaten Bolt for the first time two years earlier.|$|E

25|$|On 22 June, the MNJ {{launched}} {{a raid on}} the outskirts of Arlit, capturing five people, including four European employees of the <b>Areva</b> uranium mining company. They were released to the Red Cross in Agadez on the 25th.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{violence}} in the Aïr Massif, <b>Areva</b> NC and the Nigerien government were, by late 2008, unhindered in their exploitation of the Arlit uranium mines and in the transport of uranium by highway to ports in Benin. At the beginning of 2009, Niger and the French state mining company agreed on a deal to build the Imouraren mine near Arlit. At a projected output of five thousand tonnes of ore a year, it would be largest uranium mine in the world by 2012, as the SOMAIR and COMINAK mines were to be phased out. The deal would make Niger the second largest uranium producer in the world, and included plans to construct a civil nuclear power station for Niger. While <b>Areva</b> officials earlier in the year admitted that the security situation made it impossible to prospect at night, and that the fighting had frightened off prospecting for new sites, the operations of the mines were, by December, unaffected by the Tuareg rebellion. Despite the awarding of nearly 100 prospecting contracts to firms other than <b>Areva</b> in 2007, the high-profile Chinese and Canadian projects were not yet formalised as of 2009.|$|E

40|$|In {{the early}} 80 s, several new {{synthetic}} materials {{have come to}} be used in the treatment of canvas paintings, among them Plextol D 360, Plexisol P 550 and <b>Beva</b> 371. Today, many conservators find the information about the long term sustainability of these binding mediums to be incomplete. Evaluation of synthetic materials is mostly done through clinical research, sometimes artificial aging is simulated. The correlation between artificial and natural aging is however not established, useful information can therefore be gained through evaluations of actual conservation treatments. The intention of this study is to find out more about how the mentioned products perform over time in normal museum conditions. 104 Objects treated 10 - 35 years ago were examined non-invasively, in order to determine their current state. In most cases these binding mediums perform well. Since the chemical stability of acrylates – judging from the previous research – is proven to be good, and reasonably good in the case of <b>Beva</b> 371, it is the mechanic properties that are likely to fail over time. No correlation between the time passed and long term sustainability could be found. Sustainability seems to be highly dependent on the original properties of the object. Also important, in order to perform a sustainable conservation, is the method applied during the treatment. This study is also a survey of 16 painting conservators view on these binding mediums and methods. Here it can be concluded that these products are all in use, although 9 out of 16 wouldn’t use Plexisol P 550. Most painting conservators prefer protein glues for consolidation, but use these synthetics as alternatives for moisture-sensitive objects. Lining on Plextol D 360 is by several conservators seen as a reversible treatment. Minimum intervention and preventive conservation is seen as the most important principle in structural conservation of canvas paintings. According to this study, structural conservation with <b>Beva</b> 371 is more common today, compared to 10 - 35 years ago...|$|R

40|$|The {{results from}} the {{randomized}} phase II BELOB trial provided evidence for a potential benefit of bevacizumab (<b>beva),</b> a humanized monoclonal antibody against circulating VEGF-A, when added to CCNU chemotherapy in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM). In this study, we performed gene expression profiling (DASL and RNA-seq) of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor material from participants of the BELOB trial to identify patients with recurrent GBM who benefitted most from beva+CCNU treatment. We demonstrate that tumors assigned to the IGS- 18 or "classical" subtype and treated with beva+CCNU showed a significant benefit in progression-free survival and a trend toward benefit in overall survival, whereas other subtypes did not exhibit such benefit. In particular, expression of FMO 4 and OSBPL 3 was associated with treatment response. Importantly, the improved outcome in the beva+CCNU treatment arm was not explained by an uneven distribution of prognostically favorable subtypes as all molecular glioma subtypes were evenly distributed along the different study arms. The RNA-seq analysis also highlighted genetic alterations, including mutations, gene fusions, and copy number changes, within this well-defined cohort of tumors that may serve as useful predictive or prognostic biomarkers of patient outcome. Further validation of the identified molecular markers may enable the future stratification of recurrent GBM patients into appropriate treatment regimens. (C) 2016 AACR...|$|R

40|$|The mPEBev is an anticancer regimen which {{combines}} a chemotherapy doublet, based on cisplatin and oral etoposide (mPE), with bevacizumab (mPEBev), a mAb targeting the vasculo-endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In previous studies, this regimen showed powerful anti-angiogenetic effects and significant antitumor activity in metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) patients. We also recorded the best benefit in patients exhibiting low-systemic inflammatory profile at baseline. On these bases, {{we hypothesized that}} mPEBev antitumor activity could be partially related to bevacizumab-associated immunological effects. For this reason, we performed an immunological monitoring in 59 out of 120 stage IIIb-IV NSCLC patients enrolled in the <b>BEVA</b> 2007 phase II trial, who received fractioned cisplatin (30 [*]mg/sqm days 1 - 3 q 21) and oral etoposide (50 [*]mg, days 1 - 15 q 21) (mPE doublet) ±bevacizumab. In this group of patients, 12 received the mPE doublet alone and 47 the doublet in combination with bevacizumab (5 [*]mg/kg on the day 3 q 21; mPEBev regimen). Blood cell counts, serum analysis, multiplex cytokine assay and immunocytofluorimetric analysis, performed on baseline and post-treatment on blood samples from these patients, revealed that bevacizumab addition to the doublet decreased levels of pro-angiogenic (VEGF, Angiostatin- 1 and Follistatin) and inflammatory cytokines (interferon (IFN) γ, IL 4 and IL 17), improved in vivo and in vitro cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) response and promoted dendritic cell activation.
