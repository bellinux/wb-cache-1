5|$|Routine {{blood tests}} show {{features}} of acute inflammation (raised {{white blood cell}} count and elevated C-reactive protein level), and usually abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). In most cases the LFTs will be consistent with obstruction: raised bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. In the early stages, however, pressure on the liver cells may be the main feature and the tests will resemble those in hepatitis, with elevations in <b>alanine</b> <b>transaminase</b> and aspartate transaminase.|$|E
5|$|The {{toxic dose}} of {{paracetamol}} is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4grams. Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10grams or 200mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, {{have a reasonable}} likelihood of causing toxicity. Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24hours exceed these levels. Following a normal dose of 1gram of paracetamol {{four times a day}} for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in <b>alanine</b> <b>transaminase</b> in their liver to typically about three times the normal value. It is unlikely that this dose would lead to liver failure. Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days. In adults, a dose of 6grams a day over the preceding 48hours could potentially lead to toxicity, while in children acute doses above 200mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity. Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.|$|E

Most have slightly abnormal liver function tests such as a raised aspartate transaminase, <b>alanine</b> <b>transaminase</b> and bilirubin level. If the liver damage is significant, albumin may be decreased due to an inability of damaged liver cells to produce this protein; likewise, the prothrombin time (a test of coagulation) may be prolonged as the liver is unable to produce proteins known as clotting factors. Alkaline phosphatase levels are relatively low in those with Wilson's-related acute liver failure.

Freeze-dried strawberry powder (FSP) is effective in controlling metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk factors. The present investigation was designed to evaluate the effect of FSP on alloxan-induced diabetes in rats. MethodsDiabetes was induced in male Wistar albino rats by intraperitoneal injection of alloxan monohydrate (150  mg/kg bw), and treatment with FSP (700  mg/day for 45 days) was started 48  h after alloxan injection. Blood glucose, insulin, C-peptide, haemoglobin, renal function markers (urea, uric acid and creatinine) and enzyme markers (aspartate and <b>alanine</b> <b>transaminases</b> and alkaline phosphatase) were assayed with suitable methods. ResultsAnimals given alloxan had significant body weight loss, poor glucose tolerance and increased blood glucose with concomitant decreases in insulin, C-peptide and haemoglobin values, and significant (p <  0. 05) changes in the levels of renal function markers and enzyme activities. Oral administration of FSP for 45 days significantly (p <  0. 05) reverted the body weight loss, hyperglycaemia, biochemical parameters, enzyme activities and insulin levels to near normal levels.

Oral administration of CuLBS (30 and 60 mg/Kg) for two weeks dose-dependently flattened gastric mucosa, significantly increased gastric mucus and total acidity, compared with control group (P < 0. 01). Serum levels of liver enzymes aspartate (AST) and <b>alanine</b> <b>transaminases</b> (ALT), pro-inflammatory (IL- 6 and TNF-α) and anti-inflammatory (IL- 10) cytokines in the rats exposed to ethanol induced ulceration have been altered.
