5|$|In {{the center}} of the community, NY75 intersects Langford Road, {{designated}} as NY249 west of the junction and County Route39 (CR39) east of NY75. Past NY249, the route exits Langford <b>and</b> <b>heads</b> across another stretch of fields and farms toward the Eden town line. NY75 breaks from its due north routing just south of it, taking on a more westerly heading to avoid a valley surrounding the south branch of Eighteenmile Creek. It ultimately enters the valley, however, winding its way northward down the depression's southwestern side to reach the creek floor. From here, NY75 follows the base of the valley to the northwest for , serving a handful of homes situated along the forested creekside.

5|$|After {{one block}} of Main Street, NY32 and NY212 turn onto Market Street, then east onto Ulster Avenue after another block. As it crosses the {{railroad}} tracks and leaves the village, the road widens and becomes a commercial highway just before reaching a Thruway exit. This, the fourth time NY32 has crossed the Thruway, {{is the first time}} it does so at an exit. Beyond the overpass, the concurrency ends when NY32 turns <b>and</b> <b>heads</b> north once again. A tight nearby on-ramp provides access to the southbound Thruway. NY32 does not enter the Catskills but provides access to them along this stretch.|$|E

The road narrows back to four lanes at this interchange, and I-70 forms a concurrency with I-76 on the turnpike. After New Stanton, the road winds southeast to the exit for PA31/PA711 in Donegal. Continuing east past Donegal, the turnpike crosses Laurel Hill into Somerset County.|$|E
5|$|After this intersection, Old Baltimore Pike {{continues}} past suburban neighborhoods, {{gaining a}} center left-turn lane and intersecting Salem Church Road. Farther east, the highway reaches a junction with DE 273 in a wooded area. At this point, the road narrows to two lanes again <b>and</b> <b>heads</b> {{into the community}} of Christiana. Here, the highway intersects DE 7, where it turns north and follows that route through residential areas. The road comes to an interchange with DE 1 {{to the west of}} the Christiana Mall, where DE 7 continues north along with DE 1 and Old Baltimore Pike reaches a dead end.|$|E
