40|$|For broiler chickens, a major {{mortality}} cause on {{the entire}} exploitation period {{is represented by the}} collibacilar infections, which need a correct and efficient treatment. The mortality in 94 broiler chickens was studied, between three and thirty days of age, from four avian farms from Satu-Mare county, isolating and identifying 32 Escherichia coli strains in pure culture. The testing of sensitivity to antibiotics of the isolated germs was made through the difusimethric method, revealing a decreased efficiency to Oxitetracyclin, <b>Amoxicyllin</b> and Erithromycin, while in the case of <b>Amoxicyllin</b> + Clavulanic acid, Florfenicol and Gentamycin a good sensitivity was observed...|$|E
40|$|Pharyngotonsillitis (FT) {{and acute}} otitis media (OMA) {{are among the most}} {{frequent}} infectious diseases of the childhood and exact a heavy toll on the Italian national health service (INHS), families and society as a whole. In case of established or suspected bacterial origin, current treatment guidelines for FT recommend 5 - 10 days of oral antibiotics, chosen among available penicillins, cephalosporins, or macrolides. More controversial appears the systematical use of an antibiotic for OMAs, but prevalent expert opinion suggests use of the same agents. In this paper, an economical appraisal of five of the most prescribed oral antibiotics for these indications in Italy (cefaclor, <b>amoxicyllin,</b> amoxicyllin/clavulanate, clarithromycin and azithromycin) is provided. The evaluation was conducted through {{the development and implementation of}} two distinct models, constructed to reflect national treatment patterns of these infections. Clinical and economical data were obtained from several sources: literature review, including published meta-analyses, consultation of an expert panel and, most importantly, from the results of a specific questionnaire-based survey completed by 136 pediatricians, based throughout Italy. The models were run to conduct both cost-effectiveness and cost-minimization analyses, that consistently indicated cefaclor and <b>amoxicyllin</b> to be substantially equivalent in terms of total costs to the INHS and the Italian society, but significantly more convenient than amoxicyllin/clavulanate, claritrhomycin or azithromycin. Extensive probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of this conclusion...|$|E
40|$|Helicobacter pylori {{infection}} may {{be associated}} with duodenal ulcer (DU) and accompanied by enhanced gastrin release but the mechanism of this H pylori related hypergastrinaemia in DU patients is unclear. Cholecystokinin (CCK) has been implicated in the feedback control of gastrin release and gastric acid secretion in healthy subjects. This study therefore investigated if CCK participates in the impairment of postprandial gastrin release and gastric secretion in six DU patients. Tests were undertaken with and without elimination of endogenous CCK by loxiglumide, a selective CCK-A receptors antagonist, before and after eradication of H pylori with triple therapy (omeprazole, <b>amoxicyllin,</b> bismuth). In H pylori positive DU patients, the post-prandial decline in pH (with median pH 3. 5) was accompanied by a pronounced increment in plasma gastrin but the administration of loxiglumide did not affect significantly this postprandial rise in plasma gastrin and gastric pH profile. After eradication of H pylori, the plasma gastrin concentration was reduced while the median postprandial pH was significantly increased (median pH 4. 3). The administration of loxiglumide resulted in significantly greater increase in postprandial plasma gastrin and greater decrease in pH (median pH 3. 1) in these patients. This study shows that (a) infection with H pylori is accompanied by an enhanced gastrin release and gastric acidity in DU patients, (b) the failure of loxiglumide to affect plasma gastrin or gastric acid secretion in H pylori infected DU patients could be attributed, at least in part, to the failure of endogenous CCK to control gastrin release and gastric secretion by releasing somatostatin, and (c) the test with loxiglumide may be useful in the identification of patients with impaired feedback control of gastrin release and gastric secretion resulting from infection with H pylori...|$|E
