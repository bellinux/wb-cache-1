It is observed that the excitation of Al-salicylate which is normally observed around 330 nm gets shifted to 350 nm when doped with either of La or Y. The emission of Al-salicylate also changes and the main band is observed around 450 nm instead of 430 nm. The lower band gets shifted to lower side and is observed around 360 nm instead of 400 nm. This study will be useful in developing organic phosphors for various applications. Keywords- Photoluminescence, Organic Phosphors, salicylate comple...|$|E
