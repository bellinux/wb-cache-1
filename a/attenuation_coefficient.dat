5|$|Lead's high density, atomic number, and {{formability}} {{form the}} basis for use of lead as a barrier that absorbs sound, vibration, and radiation. Lead has no natural resonance frequencies; as a result, sheet-lead is used as a sound deadening layer in the walls, floors, and ceilings of sound studios. Organ pipes are often made from a lead alloy, mixed with various amounts of tin to control the tone of each pipe. Lead is an established shielding material from radiation in nuclear science and in X-ray rooms due to its denseness and high <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient.</b> Molten lead {{has been used as a}} coolant for lead-cooled fast reactors.|$|E
5|$|In {{transparent}} materials, the {{refractive index}} generally {{is greater than}} 1, meaning that the phase velocity is less than c. In other materials, {{it is possible for}} the refractive index to become smaller than 1 for some frequencies; in some exotic materials it is even possible for the index of refraction to become negative. The requirement that causality is not violated implies that the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant of any material, corresponding respectively to the index of refraction and to the <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficient,</b> are linked by the Kramers–Kronig relations. In practical terms, this means that in a material with refractive index less than 1, the absorption of the wave is so quick that no signal can be sent faster than c.|$|E

30|$|Our study {{demonstrated}} that the lateral variation of <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> estimated by the proposed method can identify sharp lateral discontinuities such as lithological boundaries and fracture zones. Estimating <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> separately from positive- and negative-offset data is effective in identifying lithological boundaries. We also {{demonstrated that}} <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> are more sensitive to localized fractures than phase velocities, although both <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> and phase velocities are sensitive to lithological boundaries. Therefore, simultaneous interpretation of lateral variation of <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> and that of phase velocities has a potential to distinguish lithological boundaries from the localized lateral discontinuities (fractures associated with faults). This ability would be valuable in applications such as fluid injection studies, where it may allow localized fractures to be detected using conventional seismic data.|$|R
40|$|The {{depth-averaged}} <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> {{are calculated}} from the echo pattern measurements from internal ice. The <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> around the S∅r Rondane Mountains, Antarctica were mapped from the 179 MHz airborne radio-echo sounder, which made observations during 1986. The map shows a tendency of decreasing attenuation as the surface altitude of the ice sheet increases. This result is interpreted by using the relationship between <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> and ice temperature. In addition, a cosine relationship was found between <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> and {{the angle of the}} radar polarization from the topographic contour. The dynamic range of the variety of the <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> is 1. 2 dB/ 100 m. If the ice flow is perpendicular to the topographic contour, the ice flow direction will be derived from the polarimetric radar observation...|$|R
30|$|To {{characterize}} subsurface heterogeneities, we {{proposed a}} method for estimating spatial variation in <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> of surface waves from multichannel–multishot data. Like the CMPCC analysis proposed by Hayashi and Suzuki (2004), this method retains high lateral resolution while estimating <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> at each CMP. In this method, multishot data can be easily combined because source amplitude of each shot is canceled out in estimating the local <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients.</b>|$|R

30|$|In the {{presence}} of sharp discontinuities (e.g., faults), scattered surface waves can be observed (e.g., Xia et al. 2007; Hyslop and Stewart 2013; Strobbia et al. 2014; Bergamo and Socco 2014; Hyslop and Stewart 2015). In such laterally heterogeneous media, estimated values of α not only reflect <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> related to quality factors but also include the effect of scattering (e.g., reflection) due to lateral heterogeneity. To detect lateral discontinuities, Bergamo and Socco (2014) utilized lateral variation of <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> related to scattered surface waves. They estimated two <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> at each local point (i.e., CMP in this study) from positive- and negative-offset data (e.g., Fig.  1 c). Their results demonstrated that a distinct difference between the lateral variation of <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> from positive- and negative-offset data is a good indication of the locations of a sharp lateral discontinuity. To effectively characterize lateral heterogeneities, we also focus on spatial variation of local <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> related to scattering and separately estimate <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> at each CMP from positive- and negative-offset data.|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} contact lens samples depends {{strongly}} on their free volume fractions. It {{is expected that}} the free volume fraction of the test samples will also impact their <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> for soft x rays. Samples with larger free volume fractions should have lower linear <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Linear <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> for Cd- 109 /Ag- 109 x rays have been measured in five contact lens samples.

30|$|Surface wave {{analysis}} generally neglects amplitude information, instead using phase {{information to}} delineate near-surface S-wave velocity structures. To effectively characterize subsurface heterogeneities from amplitude information, we propose {{a method of}} estimating lateral variation of <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> of surface waves from multichannel–multishot (multifold) seismic data. We extend {{the concept of the}} common midpoint cross-correlation method, used for phase velocity estimation, to the analysis of <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Our numerical experiments demonstrated that when used together, <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> and phase velocities could characterize a lithological boundary as well as fracture zone. We applied the proposed method to multifold seismic reflection data acquired in Shikoku Island, Japan. We clearly observed abrupt changes in lateral variation of estimated <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> around fault locations associated with a lithological boundary and with well-developed fractures, whereas phase velocity results could detect only the lithological boundary. Our study demonstrated that simultaneous interpretation of <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> and phase velocities has the potential to distinguish localized fractures from lithological boundaries.|$|R

30|$|Thus, our {{numerical}} experiments {{clearly demonstrated}} differences between phase velocities and <b>attenuation</b> <b>coefficients</b> in their sensitivity to heterogeneities (whether lithological boundaries or fractures).
