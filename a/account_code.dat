The research method used in this study is qualitative and descriptive case studies. Qualitative methods are research methods that explain the circumstances of a phenomenon or event by using the description of the sentence. Based on survey results revealed that the company has not applied the accounting system of accountability, this can be seen from the organizational structure which does not list the <b>account</b> <b>code</b> for each part of the organization, preparing a budget that is less in accordance with the rules of preparation of the budget in the form of statements of responsibility, and there is no cost grouping. This resulted in the company is difficult to know if it happened in a part of cost efficiency. To implement responsibility accounting system, a company must establish the center - the center is clearly accountable by giving the code - code of responsibility center. In a responsibility accounting system based on central budget - accountability and cost centers separated into controllable expenses and uncontrollable costs, as well as its reporting system. Thus the leadership would be easier to evaluate the performance of responsibility center managers.

The algorithm finds a task assignment, a schedule, and data and code memory placement in memory. Infeasible solutions caused by memory fragmentation are avoided.

Moreover, memory-aware algorithm is able to find task assignment and schedule when time minimization algorithm fails.

The need for school-level financial reporting accelerated during the 1990 s as public-school stakeholders continually expressed concern over the manner in which school districts allocated resources. District-level fiscal data were insufficient in addressing such issues as equity, adequacy, and student achievement. School-level fiscal reporting provides educational decision makers with a clearer view of a school's operation and resource allocation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop school-level financial guidelines for Illinois public school districts by analyzing fiscal reporting documents from states currently collecting school-level data. The qualitative research method was used for this study. Through document analysis design, the study identified current reporting practices from states collecting school-level fiscal data. The study explored the implementation of school-level reporting in Illinois by examining current data collection methods, the need to collect additional data, and whether increased district resources would be necessary to collect and maintain the data. Also, the benefits of school-level fiscal reporting for Illinois public school stakeholders were discussed. The study revealed that 15 states currently require school-level fiscal reporting. Key elements of school-site reporting included the need to redesign the <b>account</b> <b>code</b> structure and collect specific staff and student nonfiscal data. A clear focus on how the data are to be used would determine the type of fiscal information to be collected and encourage acceptance of the new reporting model by school-district personnel. School-level fiscal reporting gives public-school officials and policymakers more and better information to use when evaluating instructional programs and services for students. This study recommends that Illinois public school districts collect fiscal data at the school site for the purpose of reporting costs associated with the instruction of students. System-wide expenses are to remain as district-level costs and reported as such. As a result of this study, a new <b>account</b> <b>code</b> structure for school-level fiscal reporting in Illinois was developed...|$|E
