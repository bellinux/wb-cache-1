[...] In another interview with Billboard, Womack said, [...] "When a song really connects with so many people, it's because they felt something when they heard it.

40|$|Collections are artefacts—constructions {{that come}} into being when objects are {{physically}} or conceptually brought together. As artefacts, collections have properties,among the most obvious of which <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> they contain and their proportions. Rarely, however, do these properties reflect in a representative way {{what it would have}} been possible to collect. A collection consequently both reflects the situation from which it was derived, andpresents a distorted image of that situation. The latter, however, can be highly informative, if only we can determine its character. Since most collections represent samples from unknown universes, this is no easy feat—it requires that we give a presence to the non-present so that what was collected can be compared to what could have been collected to establish the nature of the biases in a collection. Although often difficult, there are nevertheless several ways in which this can be attempted, including through linguistic comparisons. Such an exercise provides the basis for reflecting on a number of matters, theoretical and practical, relating to collections and their creation. These include the very notion of a ‘collection’, differences in kinds of collections, the processes by which an assemblage of items becomes a ‘collection’, and collections as mental constructs, as mentally conceived categories made manifest...|$|E
40|$|As {{programming}} educators {{we need to}} find a way {{to engage}} our students. The students we see today have been called the Nintendo Generation. Such students are continually exposed to fast-paced sound, graphics, animation and games. It can be argued that these <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that Nintendo Generation students want to develop when learning Computer Science. As a result, computer programming educators have started to use games to engage and motivate students who are learning programming. However, there are difficulties in teaching novices to program using games. In many cases, it is too complicated for novices to begin programming with the extensive packages, libraries, and available OO languages when they are required to develop games. Moreover, the games development seem trivial to the Nintendo generation if we do not include AI. Unfortunately, AI algorithm development is not appropriate for novices who are still trying to grasp the simple syntax and semantics of programming. This paper reports on research that attempts to explore how educators can motivate students to learn programming by using simple game scenarios. The revised Bloom’s taxonomy is employed as a framework to aid in the creation teaching resources that utilise game scenarios as exemplars, exercises and assessments. Finally, some recommendations are made on how the teaching of programming might be improved through a game approach to teaching and learning. Key words: games, novice programmers, Bloom’...|$|E
40|$|There {{exists a}} broad {{inclination}} {{among those who}} theorize about mental representation {{to assume that the}} meanings of linguistic units, like words, are going to be identical to, and work exactly like, mental representations, such as concepts. This has the effect of many theorists applying facts that seem to have been discovered about the meanings of linguistic units to mental representations. This is especially so for causal theories of content, which will be the primary exemplars here. It is the contention of this essay that this approach is mistaken. The influence of thinking about language and mental representation in this way has resulted in the adoption of certain positions by a broad swathe of theorists to the effect that the content of a concept is identical to the property in the world that the concept represents, and that because of this a concept only applies to an object in the world or it does not. The consequences of such commitments are what appear to be insoluble problems that arise when trying to account for, or explain, misrepresentation in cognitive systems. This essay presents the position that in order to actually account for misrepresentation, conceptual content must be understood as being very much like measurements, in that the application of a content to an object in the world is akin to measuring said object, and that conceptual content ought be understood as being graded {{in the same way that}} measurements are. On this view, then, concepts <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that can be applied more, or less, accurately to particular objects in the world, and so are not identical to whatever it is that they represent...|$|E
