40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to provide a critical overview of available instruments to assess impairments in patients with rheumatic disorders, and to recommend reliable and valid instruments for use in allied health care and rehabilitation medicine. A com-puter-aided literature search (1982 – 2004) in several da-tabases was performed to identify studies focusing on the clinimetric properties of instruments designed to assess impairments in function in patients with rheu-matic disorders. Data on intra-rater reliability, inter-rater reliability and construct validity were extracted in a standardized way. Explicit criteria were applied for reliability and validity. Results: The search identified a total of 49 instruments to assess impairments in func-tions in patients with rheumatic disorders; 19 met the criteria for reliability, 22 met the criteria for validity, and 11 out of the 49 appeared to meet the criteria for both reliability and validity. In summary, evidence of both reliability and validity was only found for 11 out of 49 instruments for the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>impairments</b> in pa-tients with rheumatic disorders. Only a limited number of the identified instruments for the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>impairments</b> is both reliable and valid.

40|$|Background: The {{consideration}} <b>of</b> <b>impairment</b> plays {{a crucial}} role in detecting significant mental health problems in children whose symptoms do not meet diagnostic criteria. The <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>impairment</b> may be particularly relevant when only short screening instruments are applied in epidemiological surveys. Furthermore, differences between childrens’ and parents’ perceptions <b>of</b> present <b>impairment</b> and impairing symptoms are of interest with respect to treatment-seeking behaviour. Objectives: The objectives were to assess parent- and self-reported impairment due to mental health problems in a representative sample of children and adolescents; to describe the characteristics of highly impaired children with normal symptom scores; and to investigate the associations between symptoms in different problem areas and impairment. Methods: The mental health module of the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (the BELLA study) examined mental health in a representative sub-sample of 2, 863 families with children aged 7 – 17. Self-reported and parent-reported symptoms of mental health problems and associated impairment were identified by the extended version of the strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) in children 11 years and older. Results: Considerable levels of distress and functional impairment were found with 14. 1 % of the boys and 9. 9 % of the girls being severely impaired according to the parental reports. However, self-reported data shows a reversed gender-difference as well as lower levels <b>of</b> severe <b>impairment</b> (6. 1 % in boys; 10. 0 % in girls). Six percent of the sampled children suffer from pronounced impairment due to mental health problems but were not detected by screening for overall symptoms. Childrens’ and parents’ reports differed in regard to the association between reported symptom scores and associated impairment with children reporting higher impairment due to emotional problems. Conclusions: The <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>impairment</b> caused by mental health problems provides important information beyond the knowledge of symptoms and helps to identify an otherwise undetected high risk group. In the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>impairment,</b> gender-specific issues have to be taken into account.

Results suggest that the role of different moral evaluation criteria changes by age. During adolescence a greater integration of the moral criteria emerged. Moreover, adolescents also prioritized the evaluation of moral rule (forbidding to harm others) violations as non-acceptable when the perpetrator harms an innocent victim by applying a direct personal force.

The battery of tests {{was not intended to}} be cognitively oriented, by providing evidence of the cognitive impairments underpinning verbal pragmatic deficits; on the contrary, it permits the detection of the presence/absence of impairments in processing the main pragmatic features of verbal communication traditionally associated with right hemisphere lesions. Thus, apart from being a clinical tool for diagnosing pragmatic impairments of verbal communication, the BaLED represents a useful initial battery of tests for clinical assessment and for selecting specific populations of neurological patients suitable for investigation in further experimental studies...|$|E
40|$|Stroke is a {{significant}} cause of long-term disability world-wide. The post-stroke disabilities are due to loss of locomotion, activity of daily living, cognition and communication skills. Rehabilitation {{is an integral part}} of medical management and continues longitudinally through acute care, post-acute care and community reintegration. The objectives of stroke rehabilitation are to maximize the functional independence, minimize the disabilities, reintegrate back into the home and community and improve the self-esteem of patient. A comprehensive stroke rehabilitation service should provide early <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>impairments</b> and disabilities, management and prevention of complications and well-organized rehabilitation program in both in-patient and out-patient settings. A multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary team approach is necessary to reduce the post-stroke disabilities. It has many members, including physicians, physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech and language pathologists, orthotist, psychotherapists, social workers, vocational rehabilitation therapists, rehabilitation nurse, patients, families and other caregivers. Physicians caring for patients with stroke during rehabilitation must be aware of potential medical complications, as well as a number of special problems that may complicate recovery, including cognitive deficits, aphasia, dysphagia, urinary incontinence, shoulder pain, spasticity, falls and depression. Involvement of patient and caregivers in the rehabilitation process is essential. This article outlines the salient features of the early comprehensive rehabilitation after stroke...|$|E

40|$|Background. Objective <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>impairments</b> after stroke {{is vital}} for {{evidence-based}} therapy and progress monitoring. Objective. This study determines the utility of outcome measures obtained from an instrumented wrist rig for future rehabilitation trials. The tests undertaken were evaluated in terms of sensitivity to detect differences between normal and impaired participants, test-retest repeatability (repeatability coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]), and interrater agreement (Bland and Altman limits of agreement). Methods. Twelve participants with chronic poststroke hemiparesis (mean 5. 6 years); and 12 unimpaired volunteers performed a series of tasks in the rig. The hemiparetic arm (impaired group) and dominant arm (unimpaired group) were tested in 3 sessions {{on the same day}} by 2 assessors. Signals were analyzed to derive a tracking index (motor control), stretch index (spasticity), flexor modulation index (FMI) (muscle activation), force angle index (FAI) (stiffness), range of movement, and isometric force. Results and Conclusions. The means of all tests differed between impaired and unimpaired participants except for range of movement into flexion, the FAI, and the FMI. Repeatability coefficients for each test are presented as benchmark values for use in future trials in which the wrist rig tests may be used to detect change. Test-retest reliability was excellent in the impaired group (ICC = 0. 88 - 0. 98) and poor to excellent in the unimpaired group (ICC = 0. 06 - 0. 89). The Bland-Altman ranges showed no bias between assessors, and that the interassessor variability was similar to that between repeats by the same assessor for most tests...|$|E

Proper diagnosis and identification of affected structures should be obtained through history and objective assessment. From this information, an individualized evidence-based intervention plan can be developed to enable recovery while decreasing the risk of reinjury. An appropriate evaluation is needed not only to determine the correct diagnosis but also to allow for grading and determining the prognosis of the injury in those with an acute lateral ankle sprain. Examination should include an <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>impairments</b> as well as a measure of activity and participation. Evidence-based interventions for those with an acute lateral ankle sprain should include weight bearing with bracing, manual therapy, progressive therapeutic exercises, and cryotherapy. For those with chronic ankle instability (CAI), interventions should include manual therapy and a comprehensive rehabilitation program. It is essential to understand the normal clinical course for athletes who sustain a lateral ankle sprain as well as risk factors for an acute injury and CAI. Risk factors for both an acute lateral ankle sprain and CAI include not using an external support and not participating in an appropriate exercise program. Incorporating the latest evidence-based rehabilitation techniques provides the best course of treatment for athletes with an acute ankle sprain or CAI.

40|$|Two {{field trial}} {{approaches}} {{were conducted to}} show different aspects of Risk Assessment and to derive conclusions for monitoring of biodiversity in arable landscapes. The first study {{was part of a}} research project concerning Risk Assessment of genetically modified maize. The second study was complementary to a research project to evaluate the impact of pesticides in arable landscapes. Study 1 : Effects of cultivation of genetically modified Bt maize on epigeic arthropods (Araneae; Carabidae). A field study was conducted in Germany to determine the possible effects of transgenic maize cultivation on nontarget epigeic predator organisms. During the growing period of 2001 - 2003, the activity abundances of spiders and carabid beetles were recorded with pitfall traps and box traps and compared in three treatments: (1) Bt-maize (Mon 810) expressing the Cry 1 ab protein from Bacillus thuringiensis (Berliner), (2) an isogenic variety, and (3) the isogenic variety treated with insecticide. The results were evaluated using statistical and descriptive methods to address and appraise possible effects of treatments. Significantly different activity abundances in Bt plots compared with isogenic control plots were observed both for spiders and carabid beetles during 2001. However, in 2002 and 2003, no changes in community structure were detectable in any of the treatments. The change in the first year may have been caused by the influence of a massive cornborer infestation and accompanying large changes in microclimatic factors. Therefore the effect can not be classified as a detrimental effect of Bt-maize on non-target arthropods. Independent from this result, a clear shift in community structure could be found {{as a result of the}} exclusive cultivation of maize over the study period. Study 2 : Classification of beetle mite coenoses (Acari, Oribatida) in grassy field margins of the habitat type ruderalised tall oat grass meadow´Complementary to an ecological serial investigation the Oribatid-community in the habitat “ruderalised Arrhenatheretum” was surveyed. Three different arable areas in Germany (1) Jülicher Börde (2) Leipziger Tieflandsbucht and (3) Mainfranken were selected. The aim was to link and combine the coenoses of oribatid mites synecologically with those of plants and other arthropod groups (Araneae, Carabidae) and to typify joint biocoenose/site units. 67 oribatid mite species with different positions in the community could be identified. As a result of the synoptical qualitative ecological evaluation with all taxa 17 biocoenose/site units could be classified. For the classification of the units 27 differential groups and nine fundamental groups were used. Therefrom 18 groups of species contained oribatid mites. The typified biocoenoses were significantly correlated with edaphic parameters i. e. soil typ, nutrition content, moisture as the dominant factors. Other determining factors were differences in climate and modality of land use. The results of the qualitative evaluation could be supported with multivariate statistical analyses. The distribution of oribatid mites within the gradient of environmental parameters was similar to those of Carabids and Aranees. A significantly different annidation to those of epigeic predators could not be found. According to the legal regulation, the ecological requirements for monitoring communities in arable landscapes were described. The requirements were derived from the results of the conducted studies. With the two different approaches - ecological serial investigation and plot design - were generated two different sets of data. The advantages and disadvantages of these qualitative different data types for Risk Assessment were evaluated. The good ecological status should be used as a reference to assess detrimental changes of biodiversity. The definition of this status for the different arable land-types is one of the key issues for further development of monitoring for Risk Assessment. Furthermore the utmost importance of combination of retrospective and prospective Risk Assessment is shown. The challenge is to discover detrimental effects within the natural variance of species and communities in the field. Against this background, it was discussed which methods and endpoints of coenoses in arable landscapes are suitable to demonstrate the relevance of detrimental effects on coenoses best. The definition of good ecological status provide a reference for the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>impairments</b> in arable biotopes suitable for all different fields of Risk Assessment. It was proposed to harmonise the approaches for the different topics, i. e. introduction and monitoring of GMOs and pesticides, Environmental impact assessment, etc. The possibility to percept relevant effects is of utmost importance and should be the central point in Risk Assessment...|$|E

However, modern low-cost motion capture technology allows for the development <b>of</b> automated quantitative <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> motor <b>impairment.</b> Such outcome measures are crucial for advancing post-stroke treatment methods. We sought to develop an automated method of measuring the quality of movement in clinically-relevant terms from low-cost motion capture. Unconstrained movements of upper extremity were performed by people with chronic hemiparesis and recorded by standard and low-cost motion capture systems. Quantitative scores derived from motion capture were compared to qualitative clinical scores produced by trained human raters. A strong linear relationship was found between qualitative scores and quantitative scores derived from both standard and low-cost motion capture. Performance of the automated scoring algorithm was matched by averaged qualitative scores of three human raters. We conclude that low-cost motion capture combined with an automated scoring algorithm is a feasible method to assess objectively upper-arm impairment post stroke. The application of this technology may not only reduce the cost <b>of</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> post-stroke movement <b>impairment,</b> but also promote the acceptance <b>of</b> objective <b>impairment</b> measures into routine medical practice...|$|R

40|$|Since 1974, the Glasgow Coma Scale has {{provided}} a practical method for bedside <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>impairment</b> <b>of</b> conscious level, the clinical hallmark of acute brain injury. The scale {{was designed to be}} easy to use in clinical practice in general and specialist units and to replace previous ill-defined and inconsistent methods. 40 years later, the Glasgow Coma Scale has {{become an integral part of}} clinical practice and research worldwide. Findings using the scale have shown strong associations with those obtained by use of other early indices of severity and outcome. However, predictive statements should only be made in combination with other variables in a multivariate model. Individual patients are best described by the three components of the coma scale; whereas the derived total coma score should be used to characterise groups. Adherence to this principle and enhancement of the reliable practical use of the scale through continuing education of health professionals, standardisation across different settings, and consensus on methods to address confounders will maintain its role in clinical practice and research in the future...|$|R
