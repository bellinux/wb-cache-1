40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{designed}} {{to determine the effects of}} hearing loss, aviation headset type, flight workload complexity, and communication signal quality on pilots ’ performance in an army rotary-wing flight simulator. Background: To maintain flight status, army aviators who do not meet current <b>audiometric</b> <b>standards</b> require a hearing loss waiver, which is based on speech intelligibility in quiet conditions. Because hearing loss characteristics of hearing-impaired aviators can vary greatly, and because performance is likely also influenced by degree of flight workload and communication demand, it was expected that performance among hearing-impaired aviators would also vary. Method: Participants were 20 army helicopter pilots. Pilots flew three flights in a full motion-based helicopter simulator, with a different headset configuration and varying flight workload levels and communication signal quality characterizing each flight. Objective flight performance parameters of heading, altitude, and airspeed deviation and air traffic control command read-backs were measured. Results: Statistically significant results suggest that high levels of flight workload, especially in combination with poor communications signal quality, lead to deficits in flight performance and speech intelligibility. Conclusion: These results support a conclusion that factors other than hearing thresholds and speech intelligibility in quiet should be considered when evaluating helicopter pilots ’ flight safety. The results also support a recommendation that hearing-impaired pilots use assistive communication technology and not fly with strictly passive headsets. Application: The combined effects of flight environment with individual hearing levels should be considered when making recommendations concerning continued aviation flight status and those concerning communications headsets used in high-noise cockpits...|$|E
40|$|To {{effectively}} implement {{an occupational}} hearing conservation program, employers must know {{the amount of}} attenuation (noise reduction) provided by the hearing protective devices used by their employees. Currently standardized test methods, performed under laboratory conditions, cannot be easily implemented in industrial settings, and previously proposed field methods have depended upon the use of special headphones which are not typically available in the workplace.

40|$|Theoretical {{considerations}} and experimental evidence suggest that otoacoustic emission parameters {{may be used}} to reveal early cochlear damage, even before it can be diagnosed by <b>standard</b> <b>audiometric</b> techniques. In this work, the statistical distributions of a set of otoacoustic emission parameters chosen as candidates for the early detection of cochlear damage (global and band reproducibility, response level, signal-to-noise ratio, spectral latency, and long-lasting otoacoustic emission presence) were analyzed in a population of 138 ears. These cars have been divided, according to a <b>standard</b> <b>audiometric</b> test, in three classes: (1) ears of nonexposed bilaterally normal subjects, (2) normal cars of subjects with unilateral noise-induced high-frequency hearing loss, and (3) their hearing impaired ears. For all analyzed parameters, a statistically significant difference was found between classes 1 and 2. This difference largely exceeds the difference observed between classes 2 and 3. This fact suggests that the noise exposure, which was responsible for the unilateral hearing loss. also caused subclinical damage in the contralateral, audiometrically normal, car. This is a clear indication that otoacoustic emission techniques may be able to early detect subclinical damages. (C) 2002 Acoustical Society of America...|$|R
40|$|Recent work {{suggests}} that hair cells {{are not the}} most vulnerable elements in the inner ear; rather, it is the synapses between hair cells and cochlear nerve terminals that degenerate first in the aging or noise-exposed ear. This primary neural degeneration does not affect hearing thresholds, but likely contributes to problems understanding speech in difficult listening environments, and may be important in the generation of tinnitus and/or hyperacusis. To look for signs of cochlear synaptopathy in humans, we recruited college students and divided them into low-risk and high-risk groups based on self-report of noise exposure and use of hearing protection. Cochlear function was assessed by otoacoustic emissions and click-evoked electrocochleography; hearing was assessed by behavioral audiometry and word recognition with or without noise or time compression and reverberation. Both groups had normal thresholds at <b>standard</b> <b>audiometric</b> frequencies, however, the high-risk group showed significant threshold elevation at high frequencies (10 - 16 kHz), consistent with early stages of noise damage. Electrocochleography showed {{a significant difference in}} the ratio between the waveform peaks generated by hair cells (Summating Potential; SP) vs. cochlear neurons (Action Potential; AP), i. e. the SP/AP ratio, consistent with selective neural loss. The high-risk group also showed significantly poorer performance on word recognition in noise or with time compression and reverberation, and reported heightened reactions to sound consistent with hyperacusis. These results suggest that the SP/AP ratio may be useful in the diagnosis of "hidden hearing loss" and that, as suggested by animal models, the noise-induced loss of cochlear nerve synapses leads to deficits in hearing abilities in difficult listening situations, despite the presence of normal thresholds at <b>standard</b> <b>audiometric</b> frequencies...|$|R

40|$|The {{prevailing}} otolaryngologic {{approach to}} treatment of age-related hearing loss (ARHL), presbycusis, emphasizes compensation of peripheral functional deficits (i. e., hearing aids and cochlear implants).

Aging affects both the peripheral and central auditory systems, and disorders of executive function become more prevalent with advancing age.

Thus, to facilitate optimal functional capacity in our geriatric patients, a more comprehensive management strategy of ARHL is needed.

40|$|Introduction: Otoacoustic {{emissions}} are low density sounds produced from intact cochlea measureable {{in the presence}} of an intact conduction structure. The goal {{of this study was to}} assess the surgical success rate after stapes surgery by <b>standard</b> <b>audiometric</b> tests, Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emission (DPOAE) and Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission (TEOAE) as methods of evaluation of postoperative hearing. Methods: A descriptive-analytic study was conducted on 50 patients with otosclerosis at Yazd Shaheed Sadoughi Medical University from March 2004 till October 2007. TEOAE, DPOAE and other behavioral audiometric tests were performed before, three months and six months after surgery on patients and results were compared. Results: The air-bone gap threshold decreased significantly in audiogram of patients after surgery. Prior to surgery, TEOAE and DPOAE responses were not recordable in any of the patients, but after surgery, they were recordable in only two patients. Conclusion: Although conductive hearing loss improved significantly in patients who underwent successful stapes surgery, OAE tests were recordable in an insignificant number of patients. Therefore, this is not an optimal method for evaluating the surgical success rate...|$|R

40|$|Hearing loss {{is common}} in school-age {{individuals}} with Williams syndrome (WS) and extensive in adults. Prior studies with relatively small sample sizes suggest that hearing loss in WS has an early onset and may be progressive, yet the auditory phenotype and {{the scope of the}} hearing loss have not been adequately characterized. We used <b>standard</b> <b>audiometric</b> tools: Otoscopy, tympanometry, air-conduction (bone conduction when available) behavioral testing, and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) to measure hearing sensitivity and outer hair cell function. We tested 81 individuals with WS aged 5. 33 to 59. 50 years. 63 % of the school-age and 92 % of the adult participants had mild to moderately-severe hearing loss. The hearing loss in at least 50 % was sensorineural. DPOAE testing corroborated behavioral results. Strikingly, 12 of 14 participants with hearing within normal limits bilaterally had 4000 -Hz DPOAE input/output (DPOAE IO) functions indicative of outer hair cell damage and impaired cochlear compression. Our results indicate that hearing loss is very common in WS.

40|$|Obscure {{auditory}} dysfunction (OAD) is {{a disorder}} characterized by patient report of excessive amounts of difficulty understanding {{speech in the}} presence of background noise, despite relatively normal hearing sensitivity. It has been hypothesized that OAD {{may be the result of}} mild cochlear dysfunction, central auditory processing deficits, and/or psychological disorders. To evaluate auditory processing aspects of this disorder, speech recognition was measured in complex listening conditions for 10 normal-hearing persons with self-reported problems understanding speech in noisy environments. Ten normal-hearing listeners without reported difficulty hearing speech in noise served as controls. Each participant completed a <b>standard</b> <b>audiometric</b> evaluation, the QuickSIN test (standard clinical test of speech recognition in noise), and experimental speech recognition measures in simulated background environments, which included a range and combination of competitor stimuli presented in monaural and binaural conditions. The results show that the OAD participants had poorer overall speech recognition abilities in noise than did control participants for the experimental speech recognition tasks. The pattern of performance deficits suggests that the speech-understanding problems of these OAD participants are not attributable to abnormally poor binaural hearing or to a reduction in masking release. Further, performance deficits exhibited by listeners with OAD were not identified by a standard clinical speech-in-noise measure...|$|R
40|$|The {{masking effect}} of a piano composition, played at {{different}} speeds and in different octaves, on speech-perception thresholds was investigated in 15 normal-hearing and 14 moderately-hearing-impaired subjects. Running speech (just follow conversation, JFC) testing and use of hearing aids increased the everyday validity of the findings. A comparison was made with <b>standard</b> <b>audiometric</b> noises [International Collegium of Rehabilitative Audiology (ICRA) noise and speech spectrum-filtered noise (SPN) ]. All masking sounds, music or noise, were presented at the same equivalent sound level (50 dBA). The results showed a significant effect of piano performance speed and octave (P<. 01). Low octave and fast tempo had the largest effect; and high octave and slow tempo, the smallest. Music had a lower masking effect than did ICRA noise with two or six speakers at normal vocal effort (P<. 01) and SPN (P<. 05). Subjects with hearing loss had higher masked thresholds than the normal-hearing subjects (P<. 01), but there were smaller differences between masking conditions (P<. 01). It is pointed out that music offers an interesting opportunity for studying masking under realistic conditions, where spectral and temporal features can be varied independently. The results have implications for composing music with vocal parts, designing acoustic environments and creating a balance between speech perception and privacy in social settings...|$|R

The filters of the impaired group were significantly wider than those of controls at all probe levels owing to an unusual broadening of the upper slope of the filter. In addition, absolute thresholds were statistically indistinguishable between the groups at the <b>standard</b> <b>audiometric</b> frequencies, but were elevated in the impaired listeners at higher frequencies. These results strengthen the idea that this population has a variety of hearing deficits that go undetected by standard audiometry...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: We {{investigated}} {{the accuracy of}} a web-based protocol for tinnitus frequency matching {{compared to that of}} tinnitus pitch matching performed by an audiologist using an audiometer in an anechoic chamber. Methods: Twenty subjects underwent tinnitus frequency-matching in a random order using an audiometer in an anechoic chamber and using web-based software with a multiple-choice protocol in octave or half-octave steps from 250 Hz to 12, 000 Hz and a slider in 25 -Hz steps from 20 to 20, 000 Hz. Octave challenge testing was performed. The participants were asked to indicate which protocol resulted in the closest match to their tinnitus frequency. Results: The median tinnitus frequency was 6, 000 Hz (range, 2, 000 to 12, 000 Hz) with use of the audiometer and self-directed multiple-choice protocol. With the slider, the median frequency was 5, 925 Hz (range, 1, 850 to 16, 000 Hz). The patients with a tinnitus frequency higher than 12, 000 Hz experienced a greater level of satisfaction when using the computer- based slider system. Five patients experienced octave confusion with self-directed multiple-choice tinnitus matching that was corrected accurately after the octave challenge step. Conclusions: A web-based protocol for tinnitus frequency matching is as accurate as a <b>standard</b> <b>audiometric</b> protocol. An octave challenge test might be necessary for patient-directed tinnitus frequency matching. © 2012 Annals Publishing Company. All rights reserved...|$|R

The population-based Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study was designed to measure the prevalence of hearing loss in adults aged 48 - 92 years, residing in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. Hearing thresholds were measured with standardized protocols using pure-tone air- and bone-conduction audiometry in sound-treated booths. The examination also included an otoscopic evaluation, screening tympanogram, and a questionnaire on hearing-related medical history, noise exposure, other potential risk factors, and self-perceived hearing handicap. Of the 4, 541 eligible people, 3, 753 (82. 6 %) participated in the hearing study (1993 - 1995). The average age of participants was 65. 8 years, and 57. 7 % were women. The prevalence of hearing loss was 45. 9 %. The odds of hearing loss increased with age (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 88 for 5 years, 95 % confidence interval (Cl) 1. 80 - 1. 97) and were greater for men than women (OR = 4. 42, 95 % Cl 3. 73 - 5. 24).

40|$|OBJECTIVE : This report {{presents}} {{data from}} four studies to examine standard bone-conduction reference equivalent threshold force levels (RETFL), especially at 4 kHz where anomalous air-bone gaps are common. DESIGN : Data were mined from studies that obtained air- and bone-conduction thresholds from normal-hearing and {{sensorineural hearing loss}} (SNHL) participants, using commercial audiometers and <b>standard</b> <b>audiometric</b> transducers. STUDY SAMPLE : There were 249 normal-hearing and 188 SNHL participants. RESULTS : (1) Normal-hearing participants had small air-bone gaps at 0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 kHz (- 1. 7 to 0. 3 dB) and larger air-bone gaps at 4 kHz (10. 6 dB). (2) SNHL participants had small air-bone gaps at 0. 5, 1. 0, and 2. 0 kHz (- 0. 7 to 1. 7 dB) and a larger air-bone gap at 4 kHz (14. 1 dB). (3) The 4 -kHz air-bone gap grew with air-conduction threshold from 10. 1 dB when the air-conduction threshold was 5 - 10 dB HL to 21. 1 dB when the air-conduction threshold was greater than 60 dB. (4) With the 4 -kHz RETFL corrected by the average SNHL air-bone gap, the relationship between RETFL and frequency is linear with a slope of - 12 dB per octave.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Myotonic {{dystrophy}} type 1 (DM 1) is an autosomal-dominant inherited disorder clinically {{characterized by}} variable systemic manifestations. Among clinical {{features of the}} disease, 'precocious presbyacusis' has been previously reported. The underlying mechanism of this auditory impairment remains still poorly understood. Hearing is an active process located in the cochlea, where the outer hair cells (OHCs) {{play an important role}} in sound perception through a 'contractile' like movement resembling skeletal muscle fibers dynamics. OHCs status has not yet been investigated in DM 1 patients. OHCs integrity can be assessed by measuring transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE), a non-invasive, repeatable, and objective quantitative tool. METHODS: We recruited 25 patients with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of DM 1, and 28 age-matched control subjects. All of them underwent a routine audiological evaluation and TEOAE recordings. RESULTS: We detected a high prevalence of sensorineural high-frequency hearing loss (HFHL) in DM 1 patients, significantly different if compared to control subjects. Interestingly, the accurate analysis of DM 1 recorded data showed a marked impairment of TEOAE both in HFHL+ and unexpectedly in HFHL- group. Cochlear dysfunction was restricted to frequencies above 2000 Hz in the HFHL- group, but it extended to 1000 Hz in HFHL+ DM 1 patients. CONCLUSIONS:   Our study indicates that cochlear impairment in DM 1 is present, even in patients without evidence of hearing loss at a <b>standard</b> <b>audiometric</b> analysis. Hence, in the current clinical practice, an assessment of cochlear function by TEOAE recording may be useful in DM 1 patients to identify precocious signs of cochlear dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of normal hearing {{were examined in}} the laboratory for seven species of Old World monkeys. Operant conditioning procedures, coupled with <b>standard</b> <b>audiometric</b> testing methods, {{were used to assess}} thresholds of hearing, frequency range of hearing, and differential sensitivity to auditory intensity and frequency. To produce tonal stimulation, an animal was trained to touch and maintain manual contact with a contact-sensitive key and to report hearing the tone by lifting his hand from the key; this response was followed by food reinforcement. When the reporting response occurred without the auditory signal, the animal was punished by a short suspension from the experiment. Additional contingencies were added to ensure stable and reliable responding, and threshold and differential acuity determinations were then made. Threshold was defined as the stimulus value responded to correctly 50 % of the time. The frequency range of hearing of all the cercopithecoids tested extended from 60 to 40, 000 Hz, an octave above the upper bound of 20, 000 Hz for man but well below the 60 – 70, 000 Hz limit for some prosimians. Absolute sensitivity for tonal stimulation in the most sensitive frequency range (1 – 8 kHz) was about 2 × 10 − 4 microbars, comparable to that of other primates tested, including man. Thus, the Old World monkey appears only slightly less sensitive than man to small changes in intensity and frequency of acoustic stimulation. At 1000 Hz at 60 dB above the threshold of audibility, his limit of resolution is about 5 Hz for frequency and 2 dB for intensity...|$|R
40|$|The {{auditory}} {{biology and}} acoustic behavior of Arctic seals are incompletely understood, {{in large part}} due to the significant challenges of studying ice-living seals in natural habitats. Consequently, many questions regarding their perception of acoustic cues in the marine environment, {{and the ways in which}} increasing anthropogenic noise may influence their ability to detect biologically relevant sounds, remain unanswered. This dissertation describes a series of behavioral studies conducted in the laboratory to characterize the auditory capabilities of trained spotted (Phoca largha, Pallas 1811) and ringed seals (Pusa hispida, Schreber 1775) in quiet conditions, in the presence of controlled noise, and in real-world listening scenarios. The first two chapters comprise a set of three <b>standard</b> <b>audiometric</b> studies for each species, including aerial audiograms, underwater audiograms, and critical ratio measurements in both media. The results presented in Chapter 1 are the first hearing data available for spotted seals, and provide insight into the acoustic ecology of this minimally studied species. The results presented in Chapter 2 are the most comprehensive hearing data available thus far for ringed seals, and offer an updated perspective on the auditory capabilities of this species relative to historical data. Chapter 3 builds upon these standard examinations of hearing to investigate auditory performance in more complex acoustic environments—specifically, habitats altered by seismic noise from geophysical exploration. Taken together, these experiments provide fundamental knowledge about the sensory biology of spotted and ringed seals, which can be applied to management decisions for these species in an increasingly human-influenced Arctic environment...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) {{infection}} {{is the leading}} cause of congenital nongenetic sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and a major cause of prelingual SNHL that is not present at birth. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of dried blood samples on the Guthrie card has been proposed as a sensitive and specific method to screen for congenital CMV infection. Methods: Prospectively, consecutive infants who failed universal neonatal hearing screening and children referred for a non-congenital SNHL (NCHL) were included and underwent a <b>standard</b> <b>audiometric</b> and etiologic work-up. DNA was extracted from dried blood spots on neonatal Guthrie cards and amplified by real-time PCR. Data were available for 96 cases. Results: Mean age of the universal neonatal hearing screening group was 3. 8 +/- 2. 4 months (n = 41). Auditory brain stem response thresholds were 72. 9 +/- 20. 2 dB nHL. A CMV-positive PCR was obtained in 4 babies. One test was considered false-positive. This resulted in a 7. 3 % prevalence of congenital CMV infections. Mean age of the NCHL group was 4. 9 +/- 3. 2 years (n = 55). Hearing loss was moderate in 37, severe in 5, and profound in 13 children. A CMV-positive PCR was obtained in 4 children (7. 3 %). Other causes of SNHL were excluded in the PCR positive cases of both study groups. Conclusion: We advocate PCR for CMV DNA detection on Guthrie cards in the etiologic work-up of childhood SNHL and recommend serologic confirmation to exclude false-positive PCR results. 7. 3 % of SNHL in babies with congenital hearing loss and children with NCHL could be attributed with this technique to congenital CMV infection...|$|R

Presbyacusis {{refers to the}} physiological age-related changes of the peripheral and central auditory system leading to hearing impairment and difficulty understanding spoken language. In contrast to epidemiological data of other continents, the prevalence of age-related hearing loss (ARHL) in Europe is not well defined, {{due in part to}} the use of different classification systems. We performed a systematic literature review with the aim of gaining a picture of the prevalence of ARHL in Europe. The review included only population and epidemiological studies in English since 1970 with samples in European countries with subjects aged 60  years and above. Nineteen studies met our selection criteria and additional five studies reported self-reported hearing impairment. When these data were crudely averaged and interpolated, roughly 30 % of men and 20 % of women in Europe were found to have a hearing loss of 30  dB HL or more by age 70  years, and 55 % of men and 45 % of women by age 80  years. Apparent problems in comparing the available data were the heterogeneity of measures and cut-offs for grades of hearing impairment. Our systematic review of epidemiological data revealed more information gaps than information that would allow gaining a meaningful picture of prevalence of ARHL. The need for standardized procedures when collecting and reporting epidemiological data on hearing loss has become evident. Development of hearing loss over time in conjunction with the increase in life expectancy is a major factor determining strategies of detection and correction of ARHL. Thus, we recommend using the WHO classification of hearing loss strictly and including <b>standard</b> <b>audiometric</b> measures in population-based health surveys...|$|R

This is a publisher’s version of {{an article published in}} Australian Journal of Audiology 1996. This version is reproduced with permission from the publisher, Australian Academic Press. [URL] improvements in multichannel cochlear implants have led to improved speech perception for people with profound hearing impairments. Given this improvement, {{it has been suggested that}} some people with severe hearing impairments would be more successful with a cochlear implant than a hearing aid. Unfortunately little research exists to support the suitability of cochlear implants for these individuals. In order to determine this, a detailed investigation of the aided performance of people with severe hearing losses is being conducted at The University of Melbourne (School of Audiology). Severe hearing loss was defined as a pure tone average of greater than 60 dBHL, but no worse that 100 dBSPL in the better ear. At present, 15 participants have taken part in this study and their results will be discussed. Each participant took part in a <b>standard</b> <b>audiometric</b> assessment which included an audiogram, AB words, tympanometry with acoustic reflexes and an ABR. Each participant’s hearing aids were assessed to make sure that they were optimally aided. Following the hearing aid evaluation the participants took part in a series of traditional speech perception tests which included 24 consonant recognition, 11 vowel recognition, CNC words, CUNY sentences, and the Connected Speech Test (CSTv 2). Other tests of speech perception were conducted which looked at the effects of different types of background noise, amounts of reverberation, rates of speech and amount of available context. The aim of this was to better simulate “real-life” listening conditions. Consequently, a range of results for both traditional assessments of speech perception and simulated listening conditions will be presented and compared. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Background: There are no {{data on the}} {{prevalence}} of occupational noise-induced hearing loss in drivers using <b>standard</b> <b>audiometric</b> testing. The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate {{the prevalence}} and risk factors of occupational noise-induced hearing loss in drivers. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on a random sample of 4300 long-distance drivers age ≥ 20 years taken out of a total of 10, 000 estimated professionals in the city of Isfahan, Iran, from February 2006 through March 2007. The drivers were interviewed and underwent clinical and laboratory examinations including measurement of blood pressure, anthropometric data, and pure-tone audiometry in a sound-treated booths. The mean (SD) age of the participants was 40. 8 (11. 0) years with a mean (SD) duration of professional driving of 14. 7 (9. 6) years. Results: The prevalence of bilateral noise-induced hearing loss was 18. 1 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) 17. 0 ~ 19. 3]. The prevalence rates were higher in the left ear only 6. 5 % (95 % CI: 5. 8 ~ 7. 3) than the right ear only 3. 0 % (95 % CI: 2. 5 ~ 3. 9). Using a stepwise binary logistic regression model for the right and left ear only and for both ears separately, age was a significant independent predictor of bilateral noise-induced hearing loss and for the left or right ear only. When bilateral noise-induced hearing loss was entered in the model, fasting blood glucose was a significant predictor of noise-induced hearing loss. Blood pressure, cholesterol, triglyceride, body mass index, and marital status had no significant independent association with noise-induced hearing loss when other covariates were considered. Conclusion: These findings indicate that noise-induced hearing loss among the long-distance drivers appears to be similar to the world's population endures noise-induced hearing loss caused by occupational exposure to noise, with higher prevalence in the left ear only...|$|R
40|$|Hyperacusis is a {{frequent}} auditory disorder where sounds of normal volume are perceived as too loud or even painfully loud. There is {{a high degree of}} co-morbidity between hyperacusis and tinnitus, most hyperacusis patients also have tinnitus, but only about 30 - 40 % of tinnitus patients also show symptoms of hyperacusis. In order to elucidate the mechanisms of hyperacusis, detailed measurements of loudness discomfort levels (LDLs) across the hearing range would be desirable. However, previous studies have only reported LDLs for a restricted frequency range, e. g. from 0. 5 to 4 kHz, or from 1 to 8 kHz. We have measured audiograms and LDLs in 381 patients with a primary complaint of hyperacusis for the full <b>standard</b> <b>audiometric</b> frequency range from 0. 125 to 8 kHz. On average, patients had mild high-frequency hearing loss, but {{more than a third of}} the tested ears had normal hearing thresholds, i. e. ≤ 20 dB HL. LDLs were found to be significantly decreased compared to a normal-hearing reference group, with average values around 85 dB HL across the frequency range. However, receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that LDL measurements are neither sensitive nor specific enough to serve as a single test for hyperacusis. There was a moderate positive correlation between hearing thresholds and LDLs (r = 0. 36), i. e. LDLs tended to be higher at frequencies where hearing loss was present, suggesting that hyperacusis is unlikely to be caused by hearing threshold increase, in contrast to tinnitus for which hearing loss is a main trigger. Moreover, our finding that LDLs are decreased across the full range of audiometric frequencies, regardless of the pattern or degree of hearing loss, indicates that hyperacusis might be due to a generalized increase in auditory gain. Tinnitus on the other hand is thought to be caused by neuroplastic changes in a restricted frequency range, suggesting that tinnitus and hyperacusis might not share a common mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of several compression parameters on speech intelligibility in stationary and fluctuating speech-shaped noise was systematically investigated. The experiment {{was designed to}} investigate possible interaction effects between compression parameters on the speech reception threshold (SRT) in noise. Experimental conditions included all combinations of compression ratio (CR= 1 / 2, 2 / 2, 2 / 3, 3 / 3 for low/high frequencies), attack and release times (Ta/Tr= 4 / 4, 4 / 40, 40 / 40, 4 / 400, and 40 / 400 ms), and number of channels (NC= 1, 2, and 6). Twenty subjects with moderate sensorineural hearing loss {{took part in the}} extensive experiment. For stationary noise the results indicate that most compression settings yielded lower scores than those obtained with linear amplification. Single-channel compression resulted in the worst speech intelligibility whereas the results for two-channel and six-channel compression were roughly equal to each other. A compression ratio of 3 / 3 (CRlow/CRhigh) gave worse speech intelligibility than lower compression ratios. The combination of largest time constants (Ta/Tr = 40 / 400 ms) gave best results. For stationary noise two significant interaction effects were found: NC* T and NC*CR* T. Overall, the best result was obtained for two-channel compression CP(2, 2 / 3, 40 / 40) (_SRT =- 0. 7 dB). For six-channel compression the best speech intelligibility was achieved with CP(6, 2 / 2 + 2 / 3, 40 / 400) (_SRT =- 0. 4 dB) and the best result with single-channel compression was equal to that with linear amplification. For fluctuating noise, the results showed that compression had only a small influence on speech intelligibility. Although multi-channel compression is known to reduce spectral and temporal contrasts, its effect on speech intelligibility in fluctuating noise was limited. For fluctuating noise, only one significant result was obtained: overall, six-channel compression led to significantly worse speech intelligibility than compression with NC= 1 or 2. No significant interaction effects were found. For fluctuating noise, the detrimental effects of compression were smaller than for stationary noise and the variance in the SRT results was larger. This suggests that stationary noise is more suited than fluctuating noise for measuring the effect of compression on speech intelligibility. Analyses for the data of individual subjects showed that for our subjects the effect of compression was rather small with respect to the within subject variability. Additionally the measurement error was larger for subjects with worse speech intelligibility in noise. The effect of compression was not significantly related to <b>standard</b> <b>audiometric</b> characteristics such as hearing threshold or dynamic range. However, for stationary noise, a significant correlation was found between the effect of compression and the SRT for linear amplification for the lowest two compression ratios (CR= 1 / 2 and CR= 2 / 2) only. Moreover, for this noise type, the best results obtained with compression improved significantly for subjects with a worse SRT. These correlations tentatively suggest that speech in stationary noise might be more useful for determining a possible benefit of compression than pure-tone audiometric threshold or dynamic range. In contrast, most current fitting rationales are threshold based...|$|R
