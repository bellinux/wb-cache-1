5|$|In most temples, {{the focus}} was the cult image: a statue of the temple god which that god's ba was {{believed}} to inhabit while interacting with humans. The sanctuary in these temples contained either a naos, a cabinet-like shrine that housed the divine image, or a model barque containing the image within its cabin, which was used to carry the image during festival processions. In some cases the sanctuary may have housed several cult statues. To emphasize the sanctuary's sacred nature, it was kept in total darkness. Whereas in earlier times the sanctuary lay <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>back</b> of the building, in the Late and Ptolemaic periods it became a freestanding building inside the temple, further insulated {{from the outside world}} by the surrounding corridors and rooms.|$|E
25|$|Transduction is {{the process}} through which energy from {{environmental}} stimuli is converted to neural activity for the brain to understand and process. The back of the eye contains three different cell layers: photoreceptor layer, bipolar cell layer and ganglion cell layer. The photoreceptor layer is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>back</b> and contains rod photoreceptors and cone photoreceptors. Cones are responsible for color perception. There are three different cones: red, green and blue. Rods, {{are responsible for the}} perception of objects in low light. Photoreceptors contain within them a special chemical called a photopigment, which are embedded in the membrane of the lamellae; a single human rod contains approximately 10 million of them. The photopigment molecules consist of two parts: an opsin (a protein) and retinal (a lipid). There are 3 specific photopigments (each with their own color) that respond to specific wavelengths of light. When the appropriate wavelength of light hits the photoreceptor, its photopigment splits into two, which sends a message to the bipolar cell layer, which in turn sends a message to the ganglion cells, which then send the information through the optic nerve to the brain. If the appropriate photopigment is not in the proper photoreceptor (for example, a green photopigment inside a red cone), a condition called color vision deficiency will occur.|$|E

Formerly the Damrong Sawad Ananwong Hall and the Niphatpong Thawornwichit Hall. The two halls were also built by King Rama V as a banqueting hall to host foreign guests and dignitaries. By the reign of King Rama IX the building was so run down that the king ordered it to be demolished. Construction of a new hall began in 1996, but was interrupted by the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Construction was eventually resumed on 1 April 2004. The new throne hall was built on a raised platform and is composed of several inter-connected buildings forming two internal courtyards. These rooms function as a new banqueting hall and is use for important state functions. On the 13 June 2006 the hall welcomed the royal representatives of 25 monarchies worldwide for the celebration of King Rama IX's 60th Anniversary on the Throne. This included 12 ruling monarchs, 8 royal consorts and 7 crown princes.|$|E
500|$|As Misson points out, {{the seating}} was divided by class, and tickets were priced accordingly. Box seats, {{used by the}} nobility and wealthy gentry, cost 5 shillings; the benches in the pit where some gentry sat, but also critics and scholars, cost 3 shillings; tradesmen and {{professionals}} occupied the first gallery with seats costing 2 shillings, while servants and other [...] "ordinary people", as Misson refers to them, occupied the 1 shilling seats of the upper gallery. Seats were not numbered and were offered on a [...] "first come, first served" [...] basis, leading {{many members of the}} gentry to send servants to reserve seats well ahead of performances. The stage was [...] wide and [...] deep with a raked floor from the footlights to the backdrop. The angle of the rake rose one inch for every [...] of horizontal stage. The stage floor included grooves for wings and flats in addition to trap doors in the floor. The proscenium arch covered the stage equipment above the stage that included a pair of girondels – large wheels holding many candles used to counteract the light from the footlights. Towards {{the latter part of the}} 18th century, doors were placed on either side of the stage, and a series of small spikes traced the edge of the stage apron to prevent audiences from climbing onto the stage. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>back</b> of the stage, a wide door opened to reveal Drury Lane.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a novel idea of {{embedding}} a watermark {{pattern in}} BT. 656 raw digital video stream is proposed and implemented in Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) hardware for real time authentication. Earlier many watermarking algorithms are proposed for video authentication both in compressed {{as well as}} in uncompressed domain. A watermark is introduced in <b>the</b> stream either <b>at</b> source, channel or <b>at</b> <b>the</b> receiver. Most of methods targets embedding the watermark in the compressed domain before being transmitted over <b>the</b> channel or <b>at</b> <b>the</b> play <b>back,</b> <b>very</b> few techniques concentrates on the raw video data <b>at</b> <b>the</b> source. In this proposed work, we embed <b>the</b> watermark pattern <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> beginning stage of digital video production i. e., at BT. 656 video interface. A 64 -bit length device DNA or user defined payload is embedded as an invisible watermark. Optionally visible logo is used as a visible watermark. Embedding of watermark bits is done in Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) domain for its robustness against various attacks. Only the luminance component of the BT. 656 video stream is watermarked. An experimental result shows that the proposed method is operating in real time while maintaining the good perceptual visual quality measured in terms of PSNR...|$|R
50|$|Zawlbûk {{was always}} located <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{centre of the}} village, in close {{proximity}} to the chief’s residence. Since its basic purpose was to house all the bachelors of the village, it was dominantly the largest house. The size did vary from village to village {{depending on the size of}} the community. It was constructed though social work using timbers and thatch from the nearby forest. The timber forming the central pole is specially large to support most of the structure, and is called tlung. From this were extended a sloping roof and floor with support structures. The floor and walls were made of cracked bamboo, and the roof entirely of thatch. It had no special entrance as the entire front was open. However, the front had a small platform or verandah with a bamboo wall hanging from the roof up to about 5 ft, making the entrance quite low. Usually to the right of this area was reserved for the stockpile of firewood. The space around this verandah was called awkpaka, which was delimited by one (or two) massive log of wood, at about 2 ft high, spanning the whole breadth of the entrance. This was known as bawhbel (or pawmpual to the sountherners) and was an off-limit to the rest of the population, women, children, married men, and even the royalty and the council. The interior was simply a spacious empty room practically without any furniture, other than a fireplace <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> centre. <b>The</b> <b>back</b> wall was made into a small platform known as dawvan about 6 ft wide and 1 ft high from the floor. The entire floor served as a wrestling (which was pretty much the nightly activity) arena and the sleeping area. Just above was the bahzar which could be opened towards the outside as a big window.|$|R

2500|$|In stage 5, Pinotti and Sivtsov both {{finished}} with the first large group on the road, over the numerous unpaved or 'white' roads into Orvieto. Their group afforded solo stage winner Pieter Weening sufficient time that he took the next pink jersey, but the two HTC-Highroad men remained extremely well-placed in second and third overall, just two seconds back. Pinotti {{had a bad day}} on Etna in stage 9, finishing five minutes back of stage winner, new race leader, and eventual Giro champion Alberto Contador, and between three and four minutes behind the race's other top riders. The result dropped him to 25th overall, but Sivtsov remained in second place, the only rider within a minute of Contador. This difficult mountain stage nearly brought Cavendish's Giro to an end as well, as his group, which also contained Raboň, Rasmussen, and Renshaw, finished just 30 seconds inside the minimum survival time based on the stage winner's time. Rival sprinter Francisco Ventoso from [...] claimed that Cavendish should have been disqualified anyway, saying that the Manxman had illegally used the race caravan for slipstreams on his ascent of Etna. Stage 10 after the rest day {{was one of the few}} seemingly straightforward sprint stages in this Giro. When former race leader David Millar attacked out of the peloton just outside the [...] to go marker, HTC-Highroad was the team to chase him down. While they did successfully bring him back, this left their vaunted leadout train disorganized. Only Cavendish, Sivtsov, and Pinotti {{finished with}} the front group. Nonetheless, Cavendish was able to surge past Petacchi, who had been left for an early sprint by his leadout man Danilo Hondo, to claim his first victory of the race. He took the opportunity after the stage to address Ventoso's remarks, claiming that because of his star status he is always led by race officials and photographers, even when <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>back</b> of the race. Cavendish added another win in stage 12, the last flat stage before a crushingly difficult final week and a half. He was very nearly caught in the sprint by 's Davide Appollonio, but he edged out the young Italian for a second stage victory. Cavendish, and several other sprinters, left the Giro the next day.|$|E

In the three months of the summer it only freezes every other day and every night, and then the snow begins to weep off on the southerly slopes, and a few ground-willows put out their woolly buds, a tiny stonecrop or so makes believe to blossom, beaches of fine gravel and rounded stones run down to the open sea, and polished boulders and streaked rocks lift up above the granulated snow. But all that is gone in a few weeks, and the wild winter locks down again on the land; while at sea the ice tears up and down the offing, jamming and ramming, and splitting and hitting, and pounding and grounding, till it all freezes together, ten feet thick, from the land outward to deep water.|$|E
