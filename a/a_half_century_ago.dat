25|$|A re-evaluation of the {{traditional}} picture of decay and dissolution Post-Roman Britain has occurred, with sub-Roman Britain being thought rather more {{a part of the}} Late Antique world of western Europe than was customary <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>century</b> <b>ago.</b> As part of this re-evaluation some suggest that sub-Roman Britain, in its entirety, retained a significant political, economic and military momentum across the fifth century and even the bulk of the sixth. This in large part stems from attempts to develop visions of British success against the incoming Anglo-Saxons, as suggested by the Chronicles which were written in the ninth and mid-tenth century. However, recent scholarship has contested the extent to which either can be credited with any level of historicity regarding the decades around AD 500.|$|E

2500|$|He {{describes}} it, {{near the}} Big Falls, about one {{hundred yards from}} the top of the mountain at Loup Creek, [...] "When I first saw it, fifty-eight years ago, it was in a much better state of preservation than it now is. At that time a large portion of it was standing fully six or seven feet high, and was well built. Its thickness was about two feet at the base, and slightly tapered towards the top. There were a number of gates, or openings, in the wall, that are quite perceptible even at this time. They were, however, very plainly perceivable <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>century</b> <b>ago.</b> From the number of stones promiscuously scattered in the vicinity of the wall, my impression is that it was originally greater than seven or even eight feet in height." [...] This wall was nearly three and a half miles long. Some have surmised it was nearly 10 miles long in total, having short branching elements also connected. Parts of these walls were damaged during the 20th century.|$|E

2500|$|More than <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>century</b> <b>ago,</b> Mario Bauzá {{developed}} arranging in-clave {{to a high}} art. Another {{name for}} clave is guide-pattern, and that is certainly how Bauzá related to it. Bauzá taught Tito Puente, and Puente's arrangers in turn, learned from him. The techniques were passed down {{from one generation to}} the next. It's worth noting that many of the highly educated, new generation of Cuban musicians reject the idea of 3-2/2-3 clave. Both the clave genius Dafnis Prieto, and Alain Pérez, an important innovator in timba and Cuban jazz, reject the concept. Many of the younger musicians even reject the fundamental concept of [...] "clave rules." [...] Pérez states: [...] "I just don't treat the clave as a study or a profound analysis conceived around where it overlaps and where it comes in. I didn't learn it in that way" [...] (2002: web). New York-based Bobby Sanabria laments the pervasiveness of this attitude in Cuba: [...] "The lack of clave consciousness in Cuba is starting to be felt more and more where the rhythmic equilibrium established by the clave direction is being sacrificed due to lack of knowledge in how to work with it from an arranging standpoint by young arrangers especially in the timba movement" [...] (2010: 251). Perhaps Juan Formell, founder of Los Van Van, summed up this contemporary Cuban clave attitude best when he said: [...] "We Cubans like to think we have clave license [...] [...] [...] and we don't feel obsessed about the clave as many others do" [...] (1999: 16). There is currently a [...] "clave schism" [...] between these two schools of thought.|$|E
