5|$|Detailed {{analysis}} of the Voyager 2 images revealed <b>azimuthal</b> variations in {{the brightness of the}} λ ring. The variations appear to be periodic, resembling a standing wave. The origin of this fine structure in the λ ring remains a mystery.|$|E
5|$|The {{configuration}} of the magnetodisk's field is maintained by the <b>azimuthal</b> ring current (not an analog of Earth's ring current), which flows with rotation through the equatorial plasma sheet. The Lorentz force resulting from the interaction of this current with the planetary magnetic field creates a centripetal force, which keeps the co-rotating plasma from escaping the planet. The total ring current in the equatorial current sheet is estimated at 90–160million amperes.|$|E
5|$|The γ ring is narrow, {{optically}} {{dense and}} slightly eccentric. Its orbital inclination is almost zero. The {{width of the}} ring varies in the range 3.6–4.7km, although equivalent optical depth is constant at 3.3km. The normal optical depth of the γ ring is 0.7–0.9. During a ring plane-crossing event in 2007 the γ ring disappeared, which means it is geometrically thin like the ε ring and devoid of dust. The width and normal optical depth of the γ ring show significant <b>azimuthal</b> variations. The mechanism of confinement of such a narrow ring is not known, {{but it has been}} noticed that the sharp inner edge of the γ ring is in a 6:5 resonance with Ophelia.|$|E
5|$|The δ ring is {{circular}} {{and slightly}} inclined. It shows significant unexplained <b>azimuthal</b> variations in normal optical depth and width. One {{possible explanation is}} that the ring has an <b>azimuthal</b> wave-like structure, excited by a small moonlet just inside it. The sharp outer edge of the δ ring is in 23:22 resonance with Cordelia. The δ ring consists of two components: a narrow optically dense component and a broad inward shoulder with low optical depth. The width of the narrow component is 4.1–6.1km and the equivalent depth is about 2.2km, which corresponds to a normal optical depth of about 0.3–0.6. The ring's broad component is about 10–12km wide and its equivalent depth is close to 0.3km, indicating a low normal optical depth of 3×10−2. This is known only from occultation data because Voyager 2's imaging experiment failed to resolve the δ ring. When observed in forward-scattering geometry by Voyager 2, the δ ring appeared relatively bright, which is compatible with the presence of dust in its broad component. The broad component is geometrically thicker than the narrow component. This is supported by the observations of a ring plane-crossing event in 2007, when the δ ring remained visible, which is consistent with the behavior of a simultaneously geometrically thick and optically thin ring.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of several processes—diffusion and {{interchange}} instability being the main escape mechanisms—the plasma slowly leaks away from Jupiter. As the plasma moves further from the planet, the radial currents flowing within it gradually increase its velocity, maintaining co-rotation. These radial currents are also {{the source of the}} magnetic field's <b>azimuthal</b> component, which as a result bends back against the rotation. The particle number density of the plasma decreases from around 2,000cm−3 in the Io torus to about 0.2cm−3 at a distance of 35RJ. In the middle magnetosphere, at distances greater than 20RJ from Jupiter, co-rotation gradually breaks down and the plasma begins to rotate more slowly than the planet. Eventually at the distances greater than 40RJ (in the outer magnetosphere) this plasma escapes the magnetic field completely and leaves the magnetosphere through the magnetotail. As cold, dense plasma moves outward, it is replaced by hot, low-density plasma (temperature 20keV (200millionK) or higher) moving from the outer magnetosphere. This plasma, adiabatically heated as it approaches Jupiter, forms the radiation belts in Jupiter's inner magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{chiral nematic}} phase {{exhibits}} chirality (handedness). This phase {{is often called}} the cholesteric phase because it was first observed for cholesterol derivatives. Only chiral molecules (i.e., those that have no internal planes of symmetry) can give rise to such a phase. This phase exhibits a twisting of the molecules perpendicular to the director, with the molecular axis parallel to the director. The finite twist angle between adjacent molecules is due to their asymmetric packing, which results in longer-range chiral order. In the smectic C* phase (an asterisk denotes a chiral phase), the molecules have positional ordering in a layered structure (as in the other smectic phases), with the molecules tilted by a finite angle {{with respect to the}} layer normal. The chirality induces a finite <b>azimuthal</b> twist from one layer to the next, producing a spiral twisting of the molecular axis along the layer normal.|$|E
5|$|The {{main reason}} for the {{predicted}} differences between unbinilium and the other alkaline earth metals is the spin–orbit (SO) interaction—the mutual interaction between the electrons' motion and spin. The SO interaction is especially strong for the superheavy elements because their electrons move faster—at velocities comparable to the speed of light—than those in lighter atoms. In unbinilium atoms, it lowers the 7p and 8s electron energy levels, stabilizing the corresponding electrons, {{but two of the}} 7p electron energy levels are more stabilized than the other four. The effect is called subshell splitting, as it splits the 7p subshell into more-stabilized and the less-stabilized parts. Computational chemists understand the split as a change of the second (<b>azimuthal)</b> quantum number l from 1 to 1/2 and 3/2 for the more-stabilized and less-stabilized parts of the 7p subshell, respectively. Thus, the outer 8s electrons of unbinilium are stabilized and become harder to remove than expected, while the 7p3/2 electrons are correspondingly destabilized, perhaps allowing them to participate in chemical reactions. This stabilization of the outermost s-orbital (already significant in radium) is the key factor affecting unbinilium's chemistry, and causes all the trends for atomic and molecular properties of alkaline earth metals to reverse direction after barium.|$|E
5|$|The η ring has zero orbital {{eccentricity}} and inclination. Like the δ ring, {{it consists of}} two components: a narrow optically dense component and a broad outward shoulder with low optical depth. The width of the narrow component is 1.9–2.7km and the equivalent depth is about 0.42km, which corresponds to the normal optical depth of about 0.16–0.25. The broad component is about 40km wide and its equivalent depth is close to 0.85km, indicating a low normal optical depth of 2×10−2. It was resolved in Voyager 2 images. In forward-scattered light, the η ring looked bright, which indicated {{the presence of a}} considerable amount of dust in this ring, probably in the broad component. The broad component is much thicker (geometrically) than the narrow one. This conclusion is supported by the observations of a ring plane-crossing event in 2007, when the η ring demonstrated increased brightness, becoming the second brightest feature in the ring system. This is consistent with the behavior of a geometrically thick but simultaneously optically thin ring. Like the majority of other rings, the η ring shows significant <b>azimuthal</b> variations in the normal optical depth and width. The narrow component even vanishes in some places.|$|E
25|$|The Swiss {{mathematician}} Johann Lambert invented several hemispheric map projections. In 1772 {{he created}} the Lambert conformal conic and Lambert <b>azimuthal</b> equal-area projections.|$|E
25|$|The {{popularity}} of using stereographic projections to map panoramas over other <b>azimuthal</b> projections {{is attributed to}} the shape preservation that results from the conformality of the projection.|$|E
25|$|He {{introduced}} the 2nd quantum number (<b>azimuthal</b> quantum number) and the 4th quantum number (spin quantum number). He also {{introduced the}} fine-structure constant and pioneered X-ray wave theory.|$|E
25|$|Photograph {{registration}} involves aligning {{the photographs}} with the hemispherical coordinate system used for analysis, {{in terms of}} translation (centering), size (coincidence of photograph edges and horizon in coordinate system), and rotation (<b>azimuthal</b> alignment with respect to compass directions).|$|E
25|$|Firstly, the {{electrons}} are arranged into {{a sequence of}} groups in order of increasing principal quantum number n, and for equal n in order of increasing <b>azimuthal</b> quantum number l, except that s- and p- orbitals are kept together.|$|E
25|$|Logarithmic <b>azimuthal</b> is {{constructed}} {{so that each}} point's distance {{from the center of}} the map is the logarithm of its distance from the tangent point on the Earth. r(d) = cln); locations closer than at a distance equal to the constant d0 are not shown.|$|E
25|$|Scale is {{constant}} along all straight lines radiating {{from a particular}} geographic location. This is the defining characteristic of an equidistant projection such as the <b>Azimuthal</b> equidistant projection. There are also projections (Maurer's Two-point equidistant projection, Close) where true distances from two points are preserved.|$|E
25|$|The Huygens Gap {{is located}} at the inner edge of the Cassini Division. It {{contains}} the dense, eccentric Huygens Ringlet in the middle. This ringlet exhibits irregular <b>azimuthal</b> variations of geometrical width and optical depth, which may be caused by the nearby 2:1 resonance with Mimas and the influence of the eccentric outer edge of the B-ring. There is an additional narrow ringlet just outside the Huygens Ringlet.|$|E
25|$|Largely {{owing to}} the {{presence}} of residual aberrations, the effectiveness of SMO varies across slit position. At each slit position, there are different aberrations and different <b>azimuthal</b> angles of incidence leading to different shadowing. Consequently, there could be uncorrected variations across slit for aberration-sensitive features, which may not be obviously seen with regular line-space patterns. This would necessitate the use of different source-mask combinations at each slit position, i.e., multiple mask exposures per layer.|$|E
25|$|This {{star has}} about 108% of the Sun's mass {{and is about}} the same radius as the Sun. It may be {{slightly}} younger than the Sun with an estimated age of 4.1 billion years. the abundance of elements other than hydrogen or helium, what astronomers term the star's metallicity, is 41% higher than in the Sun. The projected rotational velocity of the star is 4.4km s−1, which gives the minimum <b>azimuthal</b> velocity along the star's equator.|$|E
25|$|<b>Azimuthal</b> {{projections}} {{have the}} property that directions from a central point are preserved and therefore great circles through the central point {{are represented by}} straight lines on the map. These projections also have radial symmetry in the scales and hence in the distortions: map distances from the central point are computed by a function r(d) of the true distance d, independent of the angle; correspondingly, circles with the central point as center are mapped into circles which have as center the central point on the map.|$|E
25|$|A {{fundamental}} projection classification {{is based}} on the type of projection surface onto which the globe is conceptually projected. The projections are described in terms of placing a gigantic surface in contact with the earth, followed by an implied scaling operation. These surfaces are cylindrical (e.g. Mercator), conic (e.g. Albers), or <b>azimuthal</b> or plane (e.g. stereographic). Many mathematical projections, however, do not neatly fit into any of these three conceptual projection methods. Hence other peer categories have been described in the literature, such as pseudoconic, pseudocylindrical, pseudoazimuthal, retroazimuthal, and polyconic.|$|E
25|$|The map is a portolan chart, {{as shown}} by the four compass roses (two large and two small) from which lines of bearing radiate. Some {{analyses}} assert that the map is an <b>azimuthal</b> equidistant projection centered on Cairo, but a 1998 analysis by Steven Dutch of the University of Wisconsin Green Bay shows a better fit with a point near the intersection of the present-day prime meridian and the equator. There are extensive notes in Ottoman Turkish {{around the edges of the}} map, as well as some interior detail which is mostly inaccurate and fanciful.|$|E
25|$|These orientations {{of lines}} and planes at various scales can be plotted using {{the methods of}} the Visualization of lines and planes section above. As in crystallography, planes are {{typically}} plotted by their poles. Unlike crystallography, the southern hemisphere is used instead of the northern one (because the geological features in question lie below the Earth's surface). In this context the stereographic projection {{is often referred to}} as the equal-angle lower-hemisphere projection. The equal-area lower-hemisphere projection defined by the Lambert <b>azimuthal</b> equal-area projection is also used, especially when the plot is to be subjected to subsequent statistical analysis such as density contouring.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} spherical coordinate systems following other conventions are used outside mathematics. In a geographical coordinate system positions are measured in latitude, longitude and height or altitude. There are a {{number of different}} celestial coordinate systems based on different fundamental planes and with different terms for the various coordinates. The spherical coordinate systems used in mathematics normally use radians rather than degrees and measure the <b>azimuthal</b> angle counterclockwise from the -axis to the -axis rather than clockwise from north (0°) to east (+90°) like the horizontal coordinate system. The polar angle is often replaced by the elevation angle measured from the reference plane. Elevation angle of zero is at the horizon.|$|E
25|$|Birkeland {{currents}} {{are also}} one of a class of plasma phenomena called a z-pinch, so named because the <b>azimuthal</b> magnetic fields produced by the current pinches the current into a filamentary cable. This can also twist, producing a helical pinch that spirals like a twisted or braided rope, and this most closely corresponds to a Birkeland current. Pairs of parallel Birkeland currents will also interact due to Ampère's force law: parallel Birkeland currents moving {{in the same direction}} will attract each other with an electromagnetic force inversely proportional to their distance apart whilst parallel Birkeland currents moving in opposite directions will repel each other. There is also a short-range circular component to the force between two Birkeland currents that is opposite to the longer-range parallel forces.|$|E
25|$|A Russian scientist, Valentin Smirnov, {{then had}} the idea of {{replacing}} the tube (called “liner”) with a wire array, to fight the <b>azimuthal</b> flow of the current, and therefore fight the MHD instability. The Angara V facility of the Kurchatov Institute had been built for the same reason: to help simulate and design {{the second stage of}} hydrogen bombs and test the effect of high power x-rays on nuclear missiles' warheads. The space inside the wire array was filled with polystyrene, which helps homogenize the X-ray flux. Any country developing thermonuclear weapons has its own Z machine, but those not using water lines had long rising pulses (for example 800ns in the Sphinx, the French machine at Gramat). In the UK, the Magpie machine was situated at the Imperial College under control of Malcolm Haines.|$|E
25|$|Numerous faint lineaments {{are visible}} within the quadrangle, {{especially}} in the area between the Tolstoj Basin and the large crater Zeami to the northeast. Many of these lineaments may be faint secondary-crater chains or gouges; others may represent traces of an ancestral structural pattern that partly controlled the excavation of the craters and basin. The lineaments may have been enhanced or preserved by the gentle upwarping of this region of Tolstoj ejecta discussed above. The largest lineament, which marks the northwest limit of recognizable Tolstoj ejecta, is a subdued scarp some 450km long. Rejuvenation of earlier faults or fractures by subsequent impacts probably occurred {{throughout the history of}} the planet. Thus, except for the lobate compressional scarps, it is difficult to separate internally produced structures from those of the complex impact history of Mercury. The <b>azimuthal</b> trends of all lineaments mapped within the quadrangle are, however, dominantly northwest (315°) and northeast (35°–40°). A minor, almost north-south trend is also observed. This situation is reminiscent of the so-called lunar grid on the Moon, which is generally ascribed to planetwide internal causes.|$|E

500|$|Another {{effect is}} the spin–orbit interaction, {{particularly}} the spin–orbit splitting, which in application to dubnium splits the 6d subshell—the <b>azimuthal</b> quantum number ℓ for a dshell is 2—into two subshells, with {{four of the}} ten orbitals having their ℓ lowered to 3/2 and six raised to 5/2. While all ten energy levels are actually raised (lowered in absolute values), making them less stable energetically, four of them are more stable than the other six.

500|$|As {{currently}} understood, {{the ring}} system of Uranus comprises thirteen distinct rings. In order of increasing {{distance from the}} planet they are: 1986U2R/ζ, 6, 5, 4, α, β, η, γ, δ, λ, ε, ν, μ rings. They {{can be divided into}} three groups: nine narrow main rings (6, 5, 4, α, β, η, γ, δ, ε), two dusty rings (1986U2R/ζ, λ) and two outer rings (ν, μ). The rings of Uranus [...] consist mainly of macroscopic particles and [...] little dust, although dust is known to be present in 1986U2R/ζ, η, δ, λ, ν and μ rings. In addition to these well-known rings, there may be numerous optically thin dust bands and faint rings between them. These faint rings and dust bands may exist only temporarily or consist of a number of separate arcs, which are sometimes detected during occultations. Some of them became visible during a series of ring plane-crossing events in 2007. A number of dust bands between the rings were observed in forward-scattering geometry by Voyager 2. [...] All rings of Uranus show <b>azimuthal</b> brightness variations.|$|E
500|$|Calculations have {{confirmed}} {{the accuracy of}} this simple extrapolation, although experimental verification of this is currently impossible as the half-lives of the known tennessine isotopes are too short. Significant differences between tennessine and the previous halogens are likely to arise, largely due to spin–orbit interaction— the mutual interaction between the motion and spin of electrons. The spin–orbit interaction is especially strong for the superheavy elements because their electrons move faster— at velocities comparable to the speed of light— than those in lighter atoms. In tennessine atoms, this lowers the 7s and the 7p electron energy levels, stabilizing the corresponding electrons, although two of the 7p electron energy levels are more stabilized than the other four. The stabilization of the 7s electrons is called the inert pair effect; the effect that separates the 7p subshell into the more-stabilized and the less-stabilized parts is called subshell splitting. Computational chemists understand the split as a change of the second (<b>azimuthal)</b> quantum number l from 1 to 1/2 and 3/2 for the more-stabilized and less-stabilized parts of the 7p subshell, respectively.
