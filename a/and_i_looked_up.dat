We could not quite get into the beach because of the {{obstacles}} that the Germans had placed under water and also had proximity bombs that would blow up ships. They were having trouble getting the vessels in, so they could not get to the beach, but they got into relatively shallow water. And the door went down on the landing craft, and the captain stood up and said, everyone ashore, and he was cut down by gunfire. And the first lieutenant stood up and said, everyone ashore, and he was cut down by gunfire. And then that left me, Second Lieutenant Gerald Heaney, in charge, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> and said, {{we are not going}} out that door; everybody over the side." [...] Unfortunately, the landing craft had stopped in water {{over the heads of the}} soldiers, most of whom were burdened down by packs and equipment. [...] Only by cutting loose their equipment and then swimming to shore could most of them avoid drowning.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the series}} Medical Center ended, Everett became {{frustrated}} when no movie roles were forthcoming and television roles were not working out. A long-time social drinker, he began drinking heavily. He was consuming {{a quart of}} vodka a day {{by the time he}} quit drinking in 1986. [...] "I was a functional alcoholic." [...] Shelby noted his alcohol-related mood swings and has said, [...] "finally I confronted him. I came into the bedroom with a big pot of coffee one morning and said 'we have a major problem to deal with here.'" [...] A month later, Everett caught sight of himself on a video and did not like what he saw. [...] " [...] 'Finally,' I said, 'I am really in trouble'. I stepped outside <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> and said, 'Father, you take it. I can't handle it anymore.'" [...] The next day, he told his daughters (who were living at home at the time), [...] "I am addicted to alcohol, and I am not going away to detox. I am going to do it here so that you can see what happens to someone if you let a substance take control of you." [...] He attended his first Alcoholics Anonymous meeting the next day and claimed he never drank again, attributing his discipline to his Christian faith and his self-pride.|$|E
60|$|The {{door opened}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> anxiously. The words of {{introduction}} {{which had been}} trembling upon my lips were unuttered. I stood as helpless and dumbfounded as a ploughboy, with my eyes fixed upon my mother.|$|E
6000|$|Dor. Why {{could he}} not find more of us? Pray, sister, [...] Let you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down one day, [...] To find some little ones for us to play with.|$|R

60|$|In my {{excitement}} I had {{not been}} taking notice of other things, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to see {{the lord of the}} harem charging down upon me. Again I fled to the boat, hotly pursued; but this time Maud made no suggestion of turning back.|$|E
60|$|The passage {{was soon}} {{accomplished}} {{by means of}} rafts, and many thousands of Russians having already preceded us we experienced no opposition. It was daylight when we rode into a village on the Bulgarian shore, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> sleepily at the cottages as we passed.|$|E
60|$|I {{had been}} too busy to pay much {{attention}} to the narrative or to notice a rattle of wheels, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> only when a wagon was drawn up beside the slough. A smooth-shaven man, with something familiar about his face, sat on the driving-seat smiling down at me.|$|E
60|$|WISE MAN [in a low, solemn voice]. Just now, {{before you}} came in, some one came to the door, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>I</b> saw an angel {{standing}} there.|$|R
6000|$|I {{turned away}} my head, hesitating, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> again <b>I</b> {{saw that her}} {{beautiful}} eyes were full of tears. Naturally that settled the matter, so I only said, ...|$|R
6000|$|She caressed my hand, {{but did not}} speak; <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> her worn {{face had}} dropped on the pillow, {{and her eyes were}} closed. [...] "I am tired--tired," [...] she murmured. [...] "Stay with me a little longer, but leave me if I sleep." ...|$|R
60|$|He made no answer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to {{discover}} him glancing {{over his shoulder}} through the great glass window into the other room. I stood up very quickly, {{and there in the}} further apartment were Guy and Mary, standing side by side. Our eyes met, and she came forward towards the window impulsively, and paused, with that unpitying pane between us....|$|E
60|$|I {{looked over}} the paper, for I really {{did not know what}} he meant, but he took it from me and pointed out a {{paragraph}} about children being decoyed away at Hampstead. It did not convey much to me, until I reached a passage where it described small puncture wounds on their throats. An idea struck me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "What letter, Lucy? My dear girl, what letter?" [...] asked a known {{voice in}} my ear. Could I believe that ear? No: <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up.</b> Could I trust my eyes? Had I {{recognised}} the tone? Did I now look {{on the face of}} the writer of that very letter? Was this gentleman near me in this dim garret, John Graham--Dr. Bretton himself? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You do {{not think}} it now,' he said; <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> into his clear eyes I was ashamed of myself, and could only murmur, what could I think when I saw him sitting there aiding in their cruel manoeuvres, --all for your own sake, too? ...|$|R
60|$|We {{were walking}} {{on the edge of}} the dried moat, <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> there, sure enough, was the little yellow face toned towards us in the angle of one of the windows. Seeing that I was {{watching}} him, he rose and waved his hand merrily.|$|R
6000|$|... "Confound it!" [...] I said, [...] "any {{one could}} be a mountaineer on the moon;" [...] and so set myself in earnest to the climbing.

60|$|Mr. Manners aroused me by a touch, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> quickly. So {{quickly that}} I {{surprised}} the {{trace of a}} smile about his weak mouth. Were I to die to-morrow, I would swear to this on the Evangels. Nor was it the smile which compels itself upon the weak in serious moments. Nay, there was in it something malicious. And Mr. Manners could not even act.|$|E
60|$|As I {{mounted the}} steps to the portico of the Grand Union with my head down, and lost in a {{calculation}} of these chances, I heard my name gaily called, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to see young Kendricks, formerly of our staff on Every Other Week, and still a frequent contributor, and a great favourite of my wife's and my own. My heart gave a great joyful bound at sight of him.|$|E

6000|$|... "One {{of these}} days," [...] said Jimmy plaintively, [...] "I shall be {{sitting by the}} {{roadside}} with my dinner-pail, and you will come by in your limousine, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall <b>look</b> <b>up</b> at you and say 'You hounded me into this!'

6000|$|... "It {{cursed the}} Prince, and King, {{and all of}} them," [...] said John with a shudder; [...] "it looked black <b>and</b> deadly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> crossed myself, <b>and</b> said the Blessed Name, and no doubt it writhed itself and went off in {{brimstone}} <b>and</b> smoke, for <b>I</b> shut my eyes, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> again it was gone!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Presently {{my brother}} shouted <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> {{to see him}} pulling on a fish. There was a big splash {{in the water and}} then I saw his line running out.

And he reached the framework all right! ...|$|E

If you do so I think you will get along very well. This is partly selfish advice, for I greatly desire the {{opportunity}} to treat your father hospitably. He was my friend when I was a girl, you remember, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to him with very great admiration." ...|$|E
60|$|Not {{long ago}} I {{was back in}} the Old University--how well I {{remember}} pointing it out as the jail to a stranger, who had asked me to show him round. I was in one of the library ante-rooms, when some one knocked, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> to see Campbell Fraser framed in the doorway. I had not looked on that venerable figure for half a dozen years. I had forgotten all my metaphysics. Yet it all came back with a rush. I was on my feet, wondering if I existed strictly so called.|$|E

60|$|She paused {{as if for}} an answer. I {{had none}} for her. I raised my arms, then let them fall again, and bowed my head. I heard the gentle rustle of her robe, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to see her {{staggering}} towards the door, her {{arms in front of}} her like one who is blind. She reached it, pulled it open, and from the threshold gave me one last ineffable look of her great eyes, heavy now with tears. Then the door closed again, and I was alone.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I was of {{the same}} opinion, of course, and I went at it immediately. I looked at the gloves pretty narrowly, {{and it was my}} opinion that they had been cleaned. There was a smell of sulphur and rosin about 'em, you know, which cleaned gloves usually have, more or less. I took 'em over to a friend of mine at Kennington, who was in that line, and I put it to him. [...] "What do you say now? Have these gloves been cleaned?" [...] "These gloves have been cleaned," [...] says he. [...] "Have you any idea who cleaned them?" [...] says I. [...] "Not at all," [...] says he; [...] "I've a very {{distinct}} idea who DIDN'T clean 'em, and that's myself. But I'll tell you what, Wield, there ain't above eight or nine reg'lar glove-cleaners in London," [...] - there were not, at that time, it seems - [...] "and I think I can give you their addresses, and you may find out, by that means, who did clean 'em."

6000|$|... 'Next {{moment it}} struck me that I had said an awful thing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> to see the results. When I spoke, Sorais' face was hidden in her hands, and as my words reached her she slowly raised it, and I shrank back dismayed. It was ashy white, and her eyes were flaming. She rose to her feet and seemed to be choking, but the awful thing was that she was so quiet about it all. Once she looked at a side table, on which lay a dagger, and from it to me, as though she thought of killing me; but she did not take it up. At last she spoke one word, and one only -- ...|$|E
6000|$|To this wise speech I {{received}} no answer; <b>and,</b> when <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> my pupil was smiling to herself a much-meaning, though not very gay smile; {{it seemed to}} say, [...] "He talks of he knows not what:" [...] it said this so plainly, that I determined to request information on the point concerning which my ignorance seemed to be thus tacitly affirmed.|$|R
5000|$|I {{was doing}} a film in New Zealand, on my own, in winter. I really needed a book.

Sports writer Murray Olderman wrote: [...] "The New York Giants have football's greatest ground threat, and Roosevelt Brown, an ultra-fast 245-pounder, {{is an integral part of}} it." [...] Gifford, the NFL's Most Valuable Player in 1956, later said: [...] "I wouldn't be in the Hall of Fame if it weren't for him[...] [...] [...] The longest run of my career was on a pitchout against Washington.
