40|$|Functions Virtualisation (NFV) and Software Driven Networks (SDN) {{aggregate}} resources {{across multiple}} domains. This puts requirements on understanding the overall alarm status across these domains and dependencies between them. Current practice of low-quality alarm documentation and confusion around fundamental concepts like alarm states, alarm-types {{and the underlying}} protocols like syslog and SNMP traps {{makes it hard to}} create one unified <b>alarm</b> <b>interface</b> as part of the SDN API. If alarm interfaces for the various components were expressed in a more formal manner including dependencies and propagation between the alarms the NFV/SDN interface could automatically present an integrated alarm API as well as a synthesized alarm state across the virtualized functions. We present a novel approach to alarm interfaces by providing a formal alarm model together with a domain-specific language that allows us to specify both the alarm models and the constraints placed on the alarm models in a consistent manner. This means that we can verify the consistency of an alarm interfaces and automatically generate interfaces, multi-domain correlation and aggregated states. Godkänd; 2014; 20140110 (stewal...|$|E
40|$|Network service {{providers}} {{are struggling to}} reduce cost {{while at the same}} time improving customer satisfaction. This thesis addresses three relevant underlying challenges to achievieng these goals: - managing an overwhelming flow of low-quality alarms - understanding the structure and quality of the delivered services - automation of service configurationAll of the these add to an operator's operational costs since manual work is required in order to understand the alarm and service status as well as for configuring new services. We propose solutions based on domain-specific languages, data-mining and self-learning. We look at how domain-models can be used to capture explicit knowledge for alarms and services. In addition, we apply data-mining and self-learning techniques to understand the alarm semantics. The alarm solution is validated with a quantitative analysis based on real alarm documentation and an alarm database from a large mobile service provider. A qualitative analysis of the service management solutions is given based on prototypes and input from {{service providers}}. We present an approach to alarm interfaces by providing a formal alarm model together with a domain-specic language, BASS. This means that we can verify the consistency of an <b>alarm</b> <b>interface</b> and automatically generate artifacts such as alarm correlation rules or alarm documentation based directly on the model. From a baseline without any correlation, our alarm domain-model based on vendor documentation could automatically find the root-cause alarms in 40 % of the cases. In the process of producing an alarm model from pre-existing alarm documentation for a commercial product, we found over 150 semantic warnings. We also propose a domain specific language called SALmon, which allows for efficient representation of service models, along with a computational engine for calculation of service status. Furthermore, this thesis illustrates how we can achieve automatic service configuration based on YANG, the domain-specific language standardized in the IETF. Prototypes show that the service domain-models can capture the semantics of service models, and automatically render parts of the service management solution. It is not always possible to capture expert knowledge in models. Therefore, we propose a data-mining and self-learning solution that learns alarm priorities from the decisions taken by the network administrators. The solution assigns the same severity as a human expert in 50 % of the cases compared to 17 % for the original alarm severity.

40|$|Alarm {{management}} {{has been around}} for decades in telecom solutions. We have seen various efforts to define standardised <b>alarm</b> <b>interfaces.</b> The research community has focused on various alarm correlation strategies. Still, after years of effort in industry and research alike, network administrators are flooded with alarms; alarms are suffering from poor information quality; and the costs of alarm integration have not decreased. In this paper, we explore the concept of 'alarm'. We define 'alarm' and alarm-type concepts by investigating the different definitions currently in use in standards and research efforts. Based on statistical alarm data from a mobile operator we argue that operational and capital expenditures would decrease if alarm sources would apply to our alarm model.

40|$|Chair of Advisory Committee: Dr. Udo W. Pooch A new {{methodology}} {{has been}} developed for adaptive, automated intrusion response (IR) focusing {{on the role of}} software agents in providing that response. The majority of intriKion response systems (IRSs) react to attacks by generating reports or alarms. Tins introduces a window of vulnerabihty between when an intn^ion is detected and when action is taken to defend agaimt the attack. This window of vulnerability has been reduced through an agent-b^ed system that adaptively responds to intrusions. Multiple IDSs monitor a computer system and generate intrasion <b>alarms.</b> <b>Interface</b> agents maintain a model of each IDS {{based on the number of}} false positives/negatives previously generated. It iKes tiiis model to generate an attack confidence metric and passes this metric along with the intrusion alarm to the Master Analysis agent. The M^ter Analysis agent classifies whether the incident is a continuation of an existing mcident or is a new attack. If it is a new attack, the Master Analysis agent creates a new Analysis agent to develop a response plan to the new attack.

40|$|The lack of {{visibility}} near {{earthmoving equipment}} resulted in six fatalities in U. S. surface mining operations during 2003. These accidents {{were the result}} of either a piece of equipment striking another vehicle or worker, or the equipment traveling over the edge of an embankment. Figure 1 {{is an example of a}} recent accident that resulted in serious injuries to one worker and fatal injuries to two others when a van parked in front of a haul truck. Two fatalities occurred in separate incidents when front-end loaders struck workers. Another two workers were killed when their equipment backed over the edge of a highwall or dump point [1]. There is clearly a need to provide better information to equipment operators regarding their surroundings. [] Researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Spokane Research Laboratory, are working to reduce these accidents by developing systems that sense obstacles and changes in terrain near the equipment and provide this information to the operator. Many off-the-shelf proximity warning systems that were developed for automobiles, light trucks, and recreational vehicles were evaluated on off-highway dump trucks [2]. Many limitations were found with existing systems, including frequent false alarms, limited detection range, a lack of specific information on an obstacle (e. g., location, identity), difficulties in finding suitable mounting locations, and an inability to withstand the environment. These limitations have necessitated the development of new systems designed specifically for large, off-highway, earthmoving equipment. New off-the-shelf systems available for mining equipment include radar and tag-based detection systems. Prototype systems now being developed include a proximity warning system based on the Global Positioning System (GPS) and a computer-assisted stereovision system. Development of these new systems was accomplished by working with manufacturers to modify existing systems to meet the needs of surface mining and through cooperative research with organizations to develop completely new solutions. A typical proximity warning system consists of a sensor or antenna mounted on the equipment that detects the presence of obstacles and an <b>alarm</b> <b>interface</b> in the cab of the equipment. Some systems, as described in more detail below, also require that other vehicles and personnel on the ground be outfitted with electronic tags that transmit an I m here signal back to the system (e. g., radio signal detection systems or GPS). Many types of proximity warning systems are on the market, but they are not all discussed in this paper. APPROACH In past work, engineers at NIOSH evaluated several off-the-shelf proximity warning technologies in order to verify their effectiveness on off-highway dump trucks [2]. Dump trucks were chosen because of the number and severity of accidents involving this type of equipment and because extensive blind areas around these trucks are typical. This experience allowed engineers to limit the number of systems chosen for long-term tests at mine sites to those systems showin...|$|E
40|$|Although {{seemingly}} {{simple and}} easy to design for, the moment of waking up and deciding on how long to snooze poses interesting design challenges. While traditional <b>alarm</b> clock <b>interfaces</b> feature large buttons or dropdown menus to communicate (fixed) snooze time, embodied interaction with the entire alarm clock can help to express how much snooze time is desired in a more nuanced way. This paper presents the design of Tumble Clock, a buttonless 2 ̆ 2 balance-object 2 ̆ 2 that exposes its entire surface as interaction area, allowing for snoozing its alarm simply by tilting and releasing or pushing the entire artefact. The Tumble Clock's interaction possibilities and the appreciation of this tangible approach to interaction with time have been evaluated in a user study. Our study indicates that, when enriched with feedback on action, the Tumble Clock's balance behavior can successfully facilitate in tangibly communicating variable intangible information such as snooze time...|$|R

The development of cellular communication is largely depending on the improvement and stability of Base Transceiver Station (BTS) room. So for the purpose of the development of cellular communication a large numbered BTS rooms are installed throughout the world. To ensure proper support from BTS rooms there must be a security system to avoid any unnecessary vulnerability. Therefore multiple alarm system is designed to secure the BTS rooms from any undesired circumstances.

40|$|Abstract. Network {{intrusion}} detection has been generally dealt with using sophisticated software and statistical analysis, although sometimes {{it has to}} be done by administrators, either by detecting the intruders in real time or by revising network logs, making this a tedious and timeconsuming task. To support this, {{intrusion detection}} analysis has been carried out using visual, auditory or tactile sensory information in computer interfaces. However, little is known about how to best integrate the sensory channels for analyzing intrusion detection alarms. In the past, we proposed a set of ideas outlining the benefits of enhancing intrusion detection <b>alarms</b> with multimodal <b>interfaces.</b> In this paper, we present a simplified sound-assisted attack mitigation system enhanced with auditory channels. Results indicate that the resulting intrusion detection system effectively generates distinctive sounds upon a series of simple attack scenarios consisting of denial-of-service and port scanning...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- In this paper, {{we propose}} a unitary tool for {{modeling}} {{and analysis of}} discrete event systems monitoring. Uncertain knowledge of such tasks asks specific reasoning and adapted fuzzy logic modeling and analysis methods. In this context, we propose a new fuzzy Petri net called Fuzzy Reasoning Petri Net: the FRPN. The modeling consists {{in a set of}} two collaborative FRPN. The first is used for the fault dynamic state of the system by temporal spectrum of the marking. A monitoring fuzzy Petri (MFPN) net represents the fault tree. The second model, RFPN (recovery fuzzy Petri net), corresponds to recovering activities. The two models form a dynamic loop for production system monitoring and recovery. Production system is supposed to be modelized using various type of Petri nets, with the assumption that the primary fault symptoms are known. These symptoms are considered in the monitoring FRPN and evolve in relation with all other derived faults of the system.

40|$|Abstract A novel solar humid-air-collector {{system for}} {{combined}} water treatment, space-cooling and ¿heating {{has been designed}} in an EU framework- 5 financed project called Watergy. The design consists of a construction of two prototypes for applications in architecture and greenhouse horticulture: a South European variant (for arid climate and emphasis on agricultural use) and a Central-/North European variant (for temperate climate and emphasis on integral building design). The core {{is the development of}} a collector system, following the principle of a closed, two phase thermo siphon. It achieves combined evaporation and ¿condensation, efficient heat transfer to a central heat exchanger as well as increased heat conduction from (humid) air to water. Main improvements are cost reduction in space heating and -cooling of buildings and greenhouses. Furthermore, viability increases by additional integration of greenhouse irrigation water recycling, desalination and building grey-water recycling. Sensors and actuators, connected to low-level controllers, activate a model-based control system to manage these processes.

It is based on Java and Eclipse on the Control System Studio (CSS) platform, using a relational database (RDB) to store the configuration and to log actions. It employs the Java Message Service (JMS) for communication between the modular pieces of the toolkit, which include an Alarm Server to maintain the current alarm state, an arbitrary number of <b>Alarm</b> Client user <b>interfaces</b> (GUI), and tools to annunciate alarms or log alarm related actions. Web reports allow us to monitor the alarm system performance and spot deficiencies in the alarm configuration. The Alarm Client GUI not only gives the end users various ways to view alarms in tree and table format, but also makes it easy to access guidance information, related operator displays and other CSS tools. It also allows the alarm configuration to be modified online from the GUI. Coupled with a good "alarm philosophy " on how to provide useful alarms, we can finally improve the configuration to achieve an effective alarm system...|$|R

40|$|Denial of Service (DoS) attacks do {{not attempt}} to break into {{computer}} systems but aim to the disruption of the normal system operation through overloading network and / or system resources [1]. Their complexity and magnitude is rapidly increasing and their distributed version (DDoS attacks) is becoming a nuisance to modern IT infrastructure and a very challenging detection problem [2]. Various detection solutions are proposed and many intrusion detection tools attempt to identify DDoS attacks mostly through anomaly detection, i. e. identification of deviations from normal operation patterns. We present an anomaly detection solution that relies on network flow data exported from CISCO Netflow-enabled [3] devices; this work is inspired by and augments the algorithm and set of metrics initially proposed in [4]. The proposed detection algorithm monitors flow data from all interfaces of border routing equipment and calculates specific metrics that are compared against adaptive thresholds that characterize the “normal ” network utilization. Metrics are calculated for each pair of input-output interfaces using “number of packets ” and “number of flows ” counters and their mean values. The detection algorithm generates <b>alarms</b> for specific <b>interface</b> pairs based on a boolean expression combining the metrics and the respective threshold values that adapt to changing traffic patterns. The algorithm reports interface pairs and suspected destination IP addresses affected by the detected DoS/DDoS attack; both IPv 4 and IPv 6 addresses are identified.

40|$|International audienceOver {{the last}} few decades, Condition Monitoring (CM) {{techniques}} have been strongly developed in terms of measurement devices, data processing and management capabilities. These developments have encouraged industries like nuclear, oil & gas, automotive and chemical to apply Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM) for increasing system availability, reducing maintenance costs, minimizing unscheduled shutdowns and increasing safety. CBM resorts to Fault Detection (FD) system, which delivers information on the health state of the monitored component through an <b>alarm</b> system <b>interface.</b> On {{the basis of the}} received information, the operator decides if it is necessary to perform a maintenance action or if it is possible to postpone it. In this context, one of the objectives of the European Union Project INNovation through Human Factors in risk analysis and management (INNHF, www. innhf. eu) is the development of an integrated framework of CBM modelling and Decision Making taking into account uncertainties in both the FD system and the decision making. The work here presented focuses on the first aspect of the analysis of the uncertainties that are originated in the fault detection phase. The fault detection system is considered to be based on i) an empirical model (typically called signal reconstruction model) that estimates (reconstructs) the values of measurable signals such as temperature, pressure and flow rate, in normal conditions, and on ii) statistical method to analyze the difference between the measured and reconstructed values: the presence of an abnormal condition is concluded, when the difference between the measured and reconstructed values is (statistically) significant and, then, an alarm signal is triggered. A signal reconstruction model has typically to deal with the following sources of uncertainty: 1) sensor measurement errors; 2) model uncertainties due to incorrect parameter settings or simplifying hypothesis and assumptions; 3) intrinsic stochasticity of the physical processes occurring in the plant. All these uncertainties can reduce the accuracy of the conclusions drawn from FD, and may lead the operator to perform wrong actions. In this work, a novel approach for the quantification of the effects of uncertainty on the signal reconstruction is proposed; the model considered for the reconstruction of the signals in normal condition is the Auto-Associative Kernel Regression (AAKR) model. The approach, then, relies on the estimate of the prediction intervals of the signal reconstructions with a predefined confidence level. The approach is based on the definition of a scale factor and on the use of order statistics. The proposed method has been tested using an artificial case study and will be validated using real data containing signals measured during normal operation of an healthy plant component...|$|R
