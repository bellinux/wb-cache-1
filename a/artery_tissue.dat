40|$|The {{vasoactive}} {{effects of}} bradykinin (BK) are mediated by different subtypes of kinin receptors, {{of which the}} expression varies among different tissues. In rat tail <b>artery</b> <b>tissues,</b> BK elicited a concentration-dependent vasoconstriction (EC 50, 25. 9 ± 2. 4 [*]nM; Emax, 0. 39 ± 0. 01 [*]g; n= 16). This effect of BK was endothelium independent and indomethacin insensitive. The BK-induced contraction of tail <b>artery</b> <b>tissues,</b> however, depended on both membrane potential-sensitive extracellular Ca 2 + entry and thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular Ca 2 + release. Kinin B 1 receptor antagonist or agonist {{did not affect the}} basal tension or the BK-induced contraction of tail <b>artery</b> <b>tissues</b> in the absence or presence of endothelium (P> 0. 05). In contrast, the BK-induced vasoconstriction was inhibited by kinin B 2 receptor antagonists. Pretreatment of vascular tissues with Hoe 140 (1 [*]nM) significantly changed EC 50 of the BK-induced vasoconstriction from 25. 5 ± 7. 4 [*]nM to 82. 6 ± 16. 8 [*]nM (n= 8, P< 0. 01) and Emax from 0. 43 ± 0. 03 [*]g to 0. 16 ± 0. 01 [*]g (n= 8, P< 0. 01). In the tail <b>artery</b> <b>tissues</b> from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, the BK-elicited vasoconstriction was significantly reduced (EC 50, 67. 8 ± 11 [*]nM; Emax, 0. 19 ± 0. 01 [*]g) compared to their counterparts from normal rats. The decreased vasoconstrictive effects of BK on diabetic arteries were endothelium independent and indomethacin insensitive. Our study demonstrated that the contraction of rat tail arteries induced by BK was mediated by B 2 receptors located on vascular smooth muscles.

40|$|Background: Kawasaki Disease (KD) {{can cause}} {{potentially}} life-threatening coronary arteritis in young children, {{and has a}} likely infectious etiology. Transcriptome profiling is a powerful approach to investigate gene expression in diseased tissues. RNA sequencing of KD coronary arteries could elucidate the etiology and the host response, {{with the potential to}} improve KD diagnosis and/or treatment. Methods: Deep RNA sequencing was performed on KD (n = 8) and childhood control (n = 7) coronary <b>artery</b> <b>tissues,</b> revealing 1074 differentially expressed mRNAs. Non-human RNA sequences were subjected to a microbial discovery bioinformatics platform, and microbial sequences were analyzed by Metastats for association with KD. Results: T lymphocyte activation, antigen presentation, immunoglobulin production, and type I interferon response were significantly upregulated in KD arteritis, while the tumor necrosis factor α pathway was not differentially expressed. Transcripts from known infectious agents were not specifically associated with KD coronary arteritis. Conclusions: The immune transcriptional profile in KD coronary <b>artery</b> <b>tissues</b> has features of an antiviral immune response such as activated cytotoxic T lymphocyte and type I interferon-induced gene upregulation. These results provide new insights into the pathogenesis of KD arteritis that can guide selection of new immunomodulatory therapies for high-risk KD patients, and provide direction for future etiologic studies...|$|R

40|$|Background and Purpose—The {{pathogenesis}} of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) remains elusive. Most {{studies have}} focused on individual genes, or a few interrelated genes or products, at a time in human IA. However, a broad view of pathologic mechanisms has not been investigated by identifying pathogenic genes and their interaction in networks. Our study aimed to analyze global gene expression patterns in the IA wall. Methods—To our knowledge, our group was the first to perform Illumina microarray analysis on human IA via comparison of aneurysm wall and superficial temporal <b>artery</b> <b>tissues</b> from 6 consecutive patients. We adopted stringent statistical criteria to the individual genes; genes with a false discovery rate 0. 01 and 2 -fold change were selected as differentially expressed. To identify the overrepresented biologic pathways with the differentially expressed genes, we performed hypergeometric testing of the genes selected by relaxed criteria of P 0. 01 and fold change 1. 5. Results—There are 326 distinct differentially expressed genes between IA and superficial temporal <b>artery</b> <b>tissues</b> (2 -fold change) with a false discovery rate 0. 01. Analysis of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways revealed the most impacted functional pathways: focal adhesion, extracellular matrix receptor interaction, and cell communication. Analysis of the Gene Ontology also supported the involvement of another 2 potentially important pathways: inflammatory response and apoptosis.

40|$|Drug-eluting stents {{have been}} used widely to prevent {{restenosis}} of arteries following percutaneous balloon angioplasty. Mathematical modelling {{plays an important role}} in optimising the design of these stents to maximise their efficiency. When designing a drug-eluting stent system, we expect to have a sufficient amount of drug being released into the artery wall for a sufficient period to prevent restenosis. In this paper, a simple model is considered to provide an elementary description of drug release into <b>artery</b> <b>tissue</b> from an implanted stent. From the model, we identified a parameter regime to optimise the system when preparing the polymer coating. The model provides some useful order of magnitude estimates for the key quantities of interest. From the model, we can identify the time scales over which the drug traverses the artery wall and empties from the polymer coating, as well as obtain approximate formulae for the total amount of drug in the <b>artery</b> <b>tissue</b> and the fraction of drug that has released from the polymer.

To test this hypothesis we develop a model for large deformation response of active, incompressible, nonlinear elastic and transversely isotropic living soft tissue (such as cardiac or <b>arteries</b> <b>tissues)</b> in which we include a coupling effect between the connective tissue and the muscular fibers. Then, a three-dimensional finite element formulation including this internal pseudo-active kinematic constraint is derived. Analytical and finite element solutions {{are in a very}} good agreement.

40|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) induced a concentration-dependent {{relaxation of}} isolated rat tail <b>artery</b> <b>tissues</b> which were precontracted with phenylephrine or U- 46619. This vasorelaxing effect of CO was {{independent of the}} presence of the intact endothelium. The CO-induced vasorelaxation was partially inhibited by the blockade of either the cyclicGMP pathway or big-conductance calcium-activated K (KCa) channels. When both the cyclicGMP pathway and KCa channels were blocked, the CO-induced vasorelaxation was completely abolished. Incubation of vascular tissues with hemin, in order to enhance the endogenous production of CO, suppressed the phenylephrine-induced vasocontraction in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The hemin-induced suppression of the vascular contractile response to phenylephrine was abolished after the vascular tissues were co-incubated with either oxyhaemoglobin or zinc protoporphyrin-IX, suggesting an induced endogenous generation of CO from vascular tissues. The effect of hemin incubation on vascular contractility did not involve the endogenous generation of nitric oxide. Our results suggest that CO may activate both a cyclicGMP signalling pathway and KCa channels in the same vascular tissues, and that the endogenously generated CO may significantly affect the vascular contractile responses...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Due to {{the limited}} number of {{experimental}} studies that mechanically characterise human atherosclerotic plaque tissue from the femoral arteries, a recent trend has emerged in current literature whereby one set of material data based on aortic plaque tissue is employed to numerically represent diseased femoral <b>artery</b> <b>tissue.</b> This study aims to generate novel vessel-appropriate material models for femoral plaque tissue and assess the influence of using material models based on experimental data generated from aortic plaque testing to represent diseased femoral arterial tissue. Methods Novel material models based on experimental data generated from testing of atherosclerotic femoral <b>artery</b> <b>tissue</b> are developed and a computational analysis of the revascularisation of a quarter model idealised diseased femoral artery from a 90 % diameter stenosis to a 10 % diameter stenosis is performed using these novel material models. The simulation is also performed using material models based on experimental data obtained from aortic plaque testing in order to examine the effect of employing vessel appropriate material models versus those currently employed in literature to represent femoral plaque tissue. Results Simulations that employ material models based on atherosclerotic aortic tissue exhibit much higher maximum principal stresses within the plaque than simulations that employ material models based on atherosclerotic femoral tissue. Specifically, employing a material model based on calcified aortic tissue, instead of one based on heavily calcified femoral tissue, to represent diseased femoral arterial vessels results in a 487 fold increase in maximum principal stress within the plaque at a depth of 0. 8 mm from the lumen. Conclusions Large differences are induced on numerical results as a consequence of employing material models based on aortic plaque, in place of material models based on femoral plaque, to represent a diseased femoral vessel. Due to these large discrepancies, future studies should seek to employ vessel-appropriate material models to simulate the response of diseased femoral tissue in order to obtain the most accurate numerical results...|$|E

40|$|Six point {{concentration-response}} curves {{were established}} for the contractile effect of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) on helically-cut strips of human chorionic plate <b>arteries.</b> <b>Tissues</b> were then allocated to one of four treatment groups: a control group and 3 groups exposed to the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine at 10 (- 9), 10 (- 7) or 10 (- 5) M.

The contractile response to the lower doses of PGE 2 was replaced by a small relaxation in 63 % of the treated tissues. It is suggested that in these tissues PGE 2 exerts its constrictor effect via the receptor-operated channels and that nitrendipine is blocking this effect. Similar experiments performed with PGE 1 showed great variability in the initial response. Nitrendipine 10 (- 5) M failed to exert any detectable effect on this response. Pregnancy-induced hypertension is associated with vasoconstriction in both the maternal and placental circulations.

Many {{studies have demonstrated that}} some glycoprotein isoforms could serve as biomarkers for several major diseases, such as cancers and vascular diseases, among others. Capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) is a well-established technique to separate glycoprotein isoforms, however, it suffers from limited sensitivity when UV-Vis detection is used. On the other hand, with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection, derivatization reaction to render the proteins fluorescent can destroy the resolution of the isoforms.

40|$|Background. Hypercholesterolemia is {{characterized}} by a coronary vasoconstrictive response to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine. This abnormality may be due to reduced synthesis of endothelium-derived relaxing factor and/or enhanced synthesis and release of an endothelium-derived contracting factor. Endothelin is an endothelium-derived vasoconstrictor and mitogenic peptide that is present in normal plasma, and its circulating concentrations are elevated in disease states that are characterized by abnormal endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine. The current studies were designed to test the hypotheses that experimental hypercholesterolemia results in elevation of plasma and tissue endothelin immunoreactivity and that the abnormal acetylcholine-evoked coronary vasoconstric-tion in the hypercholesterolemic animals is associated with further elevation of plasma endothelin. Methods and Results. Plasma concentrations and molecular forms of endothelin immunoreactivity were determined following 2 % cholesterol diet for 4 months in pigs and during intracoronary acetylcholine administration. Second, we assessed the presence of endothelin in the coronary vascular wall by using immunohistochemistry.

Immunostaining of human coronary <b>artery</b> <b>tissue</b> sections demonstrated immunoreactive SP-D protein in smooth muscle cells (SMC) and endothelial cells. SP-D was also detected in isolated human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMC) by PCR and immunoblot analysis. Treatment of HCASMC with endotoxin (LPS) stimulated the release of IL- 8, a pro-inflammatory cytokine. This release was inhibited> 70 % by recombinant SP-D. Overexpression of SP-D by adenoviral-mediated gene transfer in HCASMC inhibited both LPSand TNFα-induced IL- 8 release. Overexpression of SP-D also enhanced uptake of Chlamydia pneumoniae elementary bodies into HCASMC while attenuating IL- 8 production induced by bacterial exposure. Both LPS and TNFα increased SP-D mRNA levels by 5 - to 8 -fold in HCASMC, suggesting that inflammatory mediators up-regulate expression of SP-D.
