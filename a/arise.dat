5|$|<b>Arise</b> is {{the fourth}} studio album by Brazilian heavy metal band Sepultura, {{released}} in 1991 by Roadrunner Records. Upon its release, the album received top reviews from heavy metal magazines such as Rock Hard, Kerrang! and Metal Forces. <b>Arise</b> is considered Sepultura's finest hour among longtime fans. While the music on <b>Arise</b> was mostly in the same death/thrash style as their previous album, Beneath the Remains, {{it was clear that}} the Sepultura sound was acquiring an experimental edge.|$|E

5|$|Difficulties <b>arise</b> in {{tracing the}} history of design {{management}}. Even though design management as an expression is first mentioned in literature in 1964, earlier contributions created {{the context in which}} the expression could <b>arise.</b> Throughout its history, design management was influenced by a number of different disciplines: architecture, industrial design, management, software development, engineering; and movements such as system theory, design methodologies. It cannot be attributed directly to either design nor to management.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Arisen</b> {{arrives at}} the Tainted Mountain to fight Grigori, and is {{presented}} with a choice, to sacrifice the kidnapped love interest, or to face the dragon. The <b>Arisen</b> fights the dragon, and stabs it in the heart. The <b>Arisen</b> recovers their heart, {{and goes back to}} Cassardis with his/her beloved. After a few days of peace, the <b>Arisen</b> treks back to Gran Soren. Along the way, several details are revealed. The sky has been blotted out and replaced with greenish gray clouds that rain ash, and all normal monsters have been replaced with much stronger versions. After the <b>Arisen</b> reaches Gran Soren, it is revealed that half of it has collapsed, leaving a gaping hole. The <b>Arisen</b> goes to meet the duke, and is surprised to see that the duke has turned into a frail old man. It is revealed that the duke made a deal with Grigori to make himself immortal, but without Grigori, the deal is now forfeited. The duke attacks, blaming the <b>Arisen</b> for his condition, but he is swiftly beaten. Guards arrive, and the duke accuses the <b>Arisen</b> of placing a curse on him and of making a deal with Grigori. The <b>Arisen</b> is then hunted by the guards. The <b>Arisen</b> is chased to the hole in the town, where creatures begin to fly out of the hole, with one bumping the <b>Arisen</b> into the hole.|$|R

5|$|The latent karma becomes {{active and}} bears fruit when the {{supportive}} conditions <b>arise.</b> A {{great part of}} attracted karma bears its consequences with minor fleeting effects, as generally most of our activities are influenced by mild negative emotions. However, those actions that are influenced by intense negative emotions cause an equally strong karmic attachment which usually does not bear fruit immediately. It takes on an inactive state and waits for the supportive conditions—like proper time, place, and environment—to <b>arise</b> for it to manifest and produce effects. If the supportive conditions do not <b>arise,</b> the respective karmas will manifest {{at the end of}} maximum period for which it can remain bound to the soul. These supportive conditions for activation of latent karmas are determined by the nature of karmas, intensity of emotional engagement at the time of binding karmas and our actual relation to time, place, surroundings. There are certain laws of precedence among the karmas, according to which the fruition of some of the karmas may be deferred but not absolutely barred.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Arisen</b> {{and their}} main pawn fight Savan, {{now known as}} the Seneschal, and his pawn. In return for {{defeating}} the Seneschal, he/she takes Savan's place, becoming a new fount of will to the world. Before dying, Savan reveals information about being the Seneschal, and tells the <b>Arisen</b> that he is not the only <b>Arisen</b> currently, as there are multiple universes with their own respective pawns and <b>Arisen.</b> As a result, he is only the Seneschal of this universe, though it is a bitter reward, as the <b>Arisen</b> cannot be seen by anyone in the world once they return from their throne. Using the Godsbane, a sword granted to him by Grigori and Savan, the <b>Arisen</b> stabs himself in the heart. The body of the <b>Arisen</b> and the main pawn are sent hurtling back to the world. The pawn wakes up on the beach, and it is revealed by the change in his/her voice that the pawn's form has changed into that of the <b>Arisen.</b> The pawn is then greeted by the Arisen's love interest, and they walk along the beach to Cassardis. If the player romanced Selene (who was earlier revealed to be a former pawn from a past <b>Arisen,</b> her grandmother, who had given Selene her body and will to allow her to live as a human), she reveals that the <b>Arisen</b> has given his/her pawn their will and body to free them from the eternity of a pawn's life.|$|R
