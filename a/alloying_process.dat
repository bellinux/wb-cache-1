40|$|Gradient {{nanostructures}} (GNSs) {{have been}} optimized {{in recent years}} for desired performance. The diffusion behavior in GNS metals is crucial for understanding the diffusion mechanism and relative characteristics of different interfaces that provide fundamental understanding for advancing the traditional surface <b>alloying</b> <b>processes.</b> In this paper, atomic diffusion, reactive diffusion, and surface <b>alloying</b> <b>processes</b> are reviewed for various metals with a preformed GNS surface layer. We emphasize the promoted atomic diffusion and reactive diffusion in the GNS surface layer {{that are related to}} a higher interfacial energy state with respect to those in relaxed coarse-grained samples.

50|$|In this {{soldering}} process, heat {{is applied}} to the parts to be joined, causing the solder to melt and to bond to the workpieces in a surface <b>alloying</b> <b>process</b> called wetting. In stranded wire, the solder is drawn up into the wire between the strands by capillary action in a process called 'wicking'. Capillary action also takes place when the workpieces are very close together or touching. The joint's tensile strength is dependent on the filler metal used; in electrical soldering little tensile strength comes from the added solder which is why it is advised that wires be twisted or folded together before soldering to provide some mechanical strength for a joint. A good solder joint produces an electrically-conductive, water- and gas-tight join.|$|E
5000|$|Metal alloy anodes made of {{antimony}} (Sb), tin (Sn), phosphorus (P), germanium (Ge) {{and lead}} (Pb) have been studied. Carbon anodes provide organic complexes for {{the storage of}} Na+ ions, while alloyed anodes form inorganic complexes with the Na+ ions, such as Na3Sb, Na3Sn and Na3P. This capability gives alloy anodes greater theoretical capacity than carbon. Whereas amorphous carbon has shown capacity between 300-400 mAh g−1, Na3P has a theoretical capacity of 2596 mAh g−1. However, the <b>alloying</b> <b>process</b> requires a large volume {{of as much as}} 400%. This results in fractures and displaces the alloying material, which causes it to passivate and become 'dead weight', unable to accept sodium ions. Unchecked, these volume changes reduce cycle life.

5000|$|Although an alloy is {{technically}} an impure metal, {{when referring to}} alloys, the term [...] "impurities" [...] usually denotes those elements which are not desired. Such impurities are introduced from the base metals and alloying elements, but are removed during processing. For instance, sulfur is a common impurity in steel. Sulfur combines readily with iron to form iron sulfide, which is very brittle, creating weak spots in the steel. Lithium, sodium and calcium are common impurities in aluminium alloys, which can have adverse effects on the structural integrity of castings. Conversely, otherwise pure-metals that simply contain unwanted impurities are often called [...] "impure metals" [...] and are not usually referred to as alloys. Oxygen, present in the air, readily combines with most metals to form metal oxides; especially at higher temperatures encountered during alloying. Great care is often taken during the <b>alloying</b> <b>process</b> to remove excess impurities, using fluxes, chemical additives, or other methods of extractive metallurgy.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The main aim of {{this work}} is to study the {{influence}} of initial powder properties on the mechanical <b>alloying</b> <b>process</b> and final powders structure {{and the production of}} chosen powder alloy by mechanical alloying method. Design/methodology/approach: The test material was the pure niobium, tin and copper powders. The powders were ground for 2 and 10 hrs. The mechanical <b>alloying</b> <b>process</b> was conducted in a high energy SPEX mill under inert argon atmosphere. The chemical constitution and concentration of particular component were studied by X-ray microanalysis. The changes of the powder structure were tested by means of the X-ray diffractometer. The thermal properties of the chosen powder alloy were examined by DSC method. Findings: Based on the presented experiment results it is clear that initial powder properties have a large influence on the final powders structure. Most of changes during milling are connected with process parameters and powder properties. Research limitations/implications: The mechanical alloying technique makes it possible to obtain Nb 3 Sn phase but only on a laboratory scale. This is the basic research in the powder metallurgy experiment field. Further investigations should be concentrated on the developing of refinement particles during ball milling, production of the composites and powder consolidation method. Practical implications: The experiments in this work supply knowledge of ductile and less ductile powders behaviour in mechanical <b>alloying</b> <b>process.</b> This knowledge can be used in powder metallurgy technique. Originality/value: The obtained investigation result confirm the different course of mechanical <b>alloying</b> <b>process</b> in dependence on powder particles.

40|$|Metals {{processed}} by severe plastic deformation (SPD) techniques, such as equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) and high-pressure torsion (HPT), generally have submicrometer grain sizes. Consequently, they exhibit high strength as expected {{on the basis}} of the Hall–Petch (H–P) relationship. Examples of this behavior are discussed using experimental data for Ti, Al, and Ni. These materials typically have grain sizes greater than ~ 50 nm where softening is not expected. An increase in strength is usually accompanied by a decrease in ductility. However, both high strength and high ductility may be achieved simultaneously by imposing high strain to obtain ultrafine-grain sizes and high fractions of high-angle grain boundaries. This facilitates grain boundary sliding, and an example is presented for a cast Al- 7 pct Si <b>alloy</b> <b>processed</b> by HPT. In some materials, SPD may result in a weakening even with a very fine grain size, and this is due to microstructural changes during processing.
