5|$|Ibn Sahl (ca. 940–1000) {{discovered}} {{the law of}} refraction known as Snell's law. He used the law to produce the first <b>Aspheric</b> lenses that focused light without geometric aberrations.|$|E
5|$|The latest {{proposed}} extremely large astronomical telescopes, {{such as the}} Thirty Meter Telescope and the Extremely Large Telescope, will be of segmented design. Their primary mirrors will be {{built from}} hundreds of hexagonal mirror segments. Polishing and figuring these highly <b>aspheric</b> and non-rotationally symmetric mirror segments presents a major challenge. Traditional means of optical testing compares a surface against a spherical reference {{with the aid of}} a null corrector. In recent years, computer-generated holograms (CGHs) have begun to supplement null correctors in test setups for complex <b>aspheric</b> surfaces. Fig.15 illustrates how this is done. Unlike the figure, actual CGHs have line spacing on the order of 1 to 10µm. When laser light is passed through the CGH, the zero-order diffracted beam experiences no wavefront modification. The wavefront of the first-order diffracted beam, however, is modified to match the desired shape of the test surface. In the illustrated Fizeau interferometer test setup, the zero-order diffracted beam is directed towards the spherical reference surface, and the first-order diffracted beam is directed towards the test surface in such a way that the two reflected beams combine to form interference fringes. The same test setup can be used for the innermost mirrors as for the outermost, with only the CGH needing to be exchanged.|$|E
25|$|More complex are <b>aspheric</b> lenses. These are lenses {{where one}} or both {{surfaces}} have a shape that is neither spherical nor cylindrical. The more complicated shapes allow such lenses to form images with less aberration than standard simple lenses, but they are more difficult and expensive to produce.|$|E
25|$|With {{properly}} polished single-mode fibers, the emitted beam has {{an almost}} perfect Gaussian shape—even {{in the far}} field—if a good lens is used. The lens needs to {{be large enough to}} support the full numerical aperture of the fiber, and must not introduce aberrations in the beam. <b>Aspheric</b> lenses are typically used.|$|E
25|$|It was {{reported}} by Otto Ahlström in 1950 that most have <b>aspheric</b> surfaces. The best of the lenses have low spherical aberration, indicating that their surface profile was optimized to improve image quality. Most of the lenses, however, do not show any sign of optimization and produce worse images than a simple spherical lens.|$|E
25|$|In {{the eyes}} of most mammals, birds, reptiles, and most other {{terrestrial}} vertebrates (along with spiders and some insect larvae) the vitreous fluid has a higher refractive index than the air. In general, the lens is not spherical. Spherical lenses produce spherical aberration. In refractive corneas, the lens tissue is corrected with inhomogeneous lens material (see Luneburg lens), or with an <b>aspheric</b> shape. Flattening the lens has a disadvantage; the quality of vision is diminished away from the main line of focus. Thus, animals that have evolved with a wide field-of-view often have eyes that make use of an inhomogeneous lens.|$|E
25|$|Spherical {{aberration}} {{occurs because}} spherical surfaces {{are not the}} ideal shape for a lens, but {{are by far the}} simplest shape to which glass can be ground and polished, and so are often used. Spherical aberration causes beams parallel to, but distant from, the lens axis to be focused in a slightly different place than beams close to the axis. This manifests itself as a blurring of the image. Lenses in which closer-to-ideal, non-spherical surfaces are used are called <b>aspheric</b> lenses. These were formerly complex to make and often extremely expensive, but advances in technology have greatly reduced the manufacturing cost for such lenses. Spherical aberration can be minimised by carefully choosing the surface curvatures for a particular application. For instance, a plano-convex lens, which is used to focus a collimated beam, produces a sharper focal spot when used with the convex side towards the beam source.|$|E
2500|$|... 50 years later, John Hadley {{developed}} {{ways to make}} precision <b>aspheric</b> and parabolic objective mirrors for reflecting telescopes, {{building the}} first parabolic Newtonian telescope and a Gregorian telescope with accurately shaped mirrors. These were successfully demonstrated to the Royal Society.|$|E
2500|$|No further {{practical}} advance {{appears to}} {{have been made in the}} design or construction of the reflecting telescopes for another 50 years until John Hadley (best known as the inventor of the octant) developed ways to make precision <b>aspheric</b> and parabolic speculum metal mirrors. In 1721 he showed the first parabolic Newtonian reflector to the Royal Society. It had a [...] diameter, [...] focal length speculum metal objective mirror. The instrument was examined by James Pound and James Bradley. After remarking that Newton's telescope had lain neglected for fifty years, they stated that Hadley had sufficiently shown that the invention did not consist in bare theory. They compared its performance with that of a [...] diameter aerial telescope originally presented to the Royal Society by Constantijn Huygens, Jr. and found that Hadley's reflector, [...] "will bear such a charge as to make it magnify the object as many times as the latter with its due charge", and that it represents objects as distinct, though not altogether so clear and bright.|$|E

50|$|The {{problem with}} <b>aspheric</b> lenses {{is that they}} are a broad category. A lens is made of two curved {{surfaces}}, and an <b>aspheric</b> lens is a lens where one or both of those surfaces is not spherical. Further research and development is being conducted to determine if the mathematical and theoretical benefits of <b>aspheric</b> lenses can actually lead to better vision correction.|$|E

5000|$|Francis Smethwick {{ground the}} first {{high-quality}} <b>aspheric</b> lenses and presented {{them to the}} Royal Society on February 27, 1667/8. A telescope containing three <b>aspheric</b> elements was judged by those present [...] "to exceed common, but very good telescope in goodness, by taking in a greater Angle and representing the Objects more exactly in their respective proportions, and enduring a greater Aperture, free from Colours." [...] <b>Aspheric</b> reading and burning glasses also outdid their spherical equivalents.|$|E
5000|$|Convex <b>aspheric</b> curvatures {{are used}} in many presbyopic vari-focal lenses to {{increase}} the optical power over part of the lens, aiding in near-pointed tasks such as reading.

Also, in aphakia or extreme hyperopia, high plus power <b>aspheric</b> lenses can be prescribed, but this practice is becoming obsolete, replaced by surgical implants of intra-ocular lenses.

5000|$|... 1968: OP Fisheye-Nikkor 10mm f/5.6 (Japan): first SLR lens with aspherical elements. Was a 180° orthographic {{projection}} fisheye lens for Nikon and Nikkormat 35 mm SLRs. Typical lens elements have spherically curved surfaces. However, this causes off-axis light {{to be focused}} closer to the lens than axial rays (spherical aberration) and degrading image sharpness; especially severe in very wide angle or aperture lenses. This can be prevented by using elements with convoluted <b>aspheric</b> curves. Although this was understood since the 17th century, the grinding of <b>aspheric</b> glass surfaces was extremely difficult and prevented their consumer use until the E. Leitz 50mm f/1.2 Noctilux (West Germany) in 1966; for Leica M-series 35 mm RFs.
