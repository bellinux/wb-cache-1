40|$|Medicinal {{plants are}} {{traditionally}} used in folk medicine as natural healing remedies with therapeutic effects such as prevention of cardiovascular diseases, inflammation disorders, or {{reducing the risk}} of cancer. In addition, pharmacological industry utilizes medicinal plants due to the presence of <b>active</b> chemical <b>substances</b> as <b>agents</b> for drug synthesis. They are valuable also for food and cosmetic industry as additives, due to their preservative effects {{because of the presence of}} antioxidants and antimicrobial constituents. To commonly used medicinal plants with antioxidant activity known worldwide belong plants from several families, especially Lamiaceae (rosemary, sage, oregano, marjoram, basil, thyme, mints, balm), Apiaceae (cumin, fennel, caraway), and Zingiberaceae (turmeric, ginger). The antioxidant properties of medicinal plants depend on the plant, its variety, environmental conditions, climatic and seasonal variations, geographical regions of growth, degree of ripeness, growing practices, and many other factors such as postharvest treatment and processing. In addition, composition and concentration of present antioxidants, such as phenolic compounds, are related to antioxidant effect. For appropriate determination of antioxidant capacity, the extraction technique, its conditions, solvent used, and particular assay methodology are important...|$|R
50|$|Bone cement {{has proven}} {{particularly}} useful because specific <b>active</b> <b>substances,</b> e.g. antibiotics, {{can be added}} to the powder component. The <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> are released locally after implant placement of the new joint, i.e. in the immediate vicinity of the new prosthesis and have been confirmed to reduce the danger of infection. The antibiotics act against bacteria precisely at the site where they are required in the open wound without subjecting the body in general to unnecessarily high antibiotic levels. This makes bone cement a modern drug delivery system that delivers the required drugs directly to the surgical site. The important factor is not how much <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> is in the cement matrix but how much of the <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> is actually released locally. Too much <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> in the bone cement would actually be detrimental, because the mechanical stability of the fixed prosthesis is weakened by a high proportion of <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> in the cement. The local <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> levels of industrially manufactured bone cements that are formed by the use of bone cements that contain <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> are approximate (assuming that there is no incompatibility) and are significantly below the clinical routine dosages for systemic single injections.|$|R

30|$|Discussion It {{could be}} shown which <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> are applied in Switzerland in {{substantial}} amounts. Although close to 300 <b>active</b> biocidal <b>substances</b> are used, only about 30 substances {{are employed in}} relevant amounts of more than 5000 [*]kg per year. For 22 <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> with low biodegradability, a potential environmental risk for natural surface waters can be inferred. These <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> are used at amounts comparable to the pesticides.|$|R
30|$|The {{advantages}} of a centralised and decentralised authorisation procedure are discussed for biocidal products in special product types. Furthermore we stipulate that biocidal <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> which are nano particles are treated as separate <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> with own identities. Due to animal welfare reasons it should be obligatory to share data from vertebrate animal studies as it is already mandatory under the REACH regulation. The import of articles treated with biocidal <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> into the European market should only be allowed, if the <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> is approved for their biocidal use within the EU. Finally we suggest to implement an obligation to report the market shares or consumption rates of biocidal <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> and products.|$|R

50|$|As {{indicated}} above, {{the risk}} assessment of biocides in EU hinges {{for a large}} part {{by the development of}} specific emission scenario documents (ESDs) for each product type, which is essential for assessing its exposure of man and the environment. Such ESDs provide detailed scenarios to be used for an initial worse case exposure assessment and for subsequent refinements. ESDs are developed in close collaboration with the OECD Task Force on Biocides and the OECD Exposure Assessment Task Force and are publicly available from websites managed by the Joint Research Centre and OECD (see below). Once ESDs become available they are introduced in the European Union System for the Evaluation of Substances (EUSES), an IT tool supporting the implementation of the risk assessment principles set in the Technical Guidance Document for the Risk Assessment of Biocides (TGD). EUSES enables government authorities, research institutes and chemical companies to carry out rapid and efficient assessments of the general risks posed by substances to man and the environment. Once a biocidal <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> is allowed onto the list of approved <b>active</b> <b>substances,</b> its specifications become a reference source of that <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> (so called 'reference active substance'). Thus, when an alternative source of that <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> appears (e.g. from a company that have not participated in the Review Programme of <b>active</b> <b>substances)</b> or when a change appears in the manufacturing location and/or manufacturing process of a reference <b>active</b> <b>substance,</b> then a technical equivalence between these different sources needs to be established with regard to the chemical composition and hazard profile. This is to check if the level of hazard posed to health and environment by the <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> from the secondary source is comparable to the initial assessed <b>active</b> <b>substance.</b>|$|R
