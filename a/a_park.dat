5|$|Proposals {{to create}} <b>a</b> <b>park</b> were first raised {{beginning}} in 1985. The Réunion Environmental Charter and the Regional Development Plan formally established {{the principle that}} <b>a</b> <b>park</b> should be created in , the mountainous interior of the island.

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>park</b> was {{established}} {{next to the}} castle; <b>a</b> <b>park</b> was highly prestigious and it enabled Thomas to engage in hunting, provided the castle with a supply of venison as well as generating income. Most of the village of Wittenham had to be destroyed {{to make way for}} the park and the site eventually became a deserted village. A new parish church, St Leonard's Chapel, was built by Thomas just outside the castle, after he had demolished the earlier, simpler 12th-century church during the construction of the inner court. Thomas died in 1397 and was buried in the newly built St Anne's Chapel, forming the north transept of St Leonard's Chapel.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>parking</b> space {{commonly}} contains <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> chock, <b>a</b> barrier {{which is}} used to prevent cars from pulling too far into the space and obstructing <b>an</b> adjacent <b>parking</b> space, curb, or sidewalk.|$|R
40|$|Various {{examples}} {{are related to}} parking management, including identifying and reserving empty parking spaces. In one example, <b>a</b> smart <b>parking</b> space system includes <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> controller located at <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> space. The parking controller can identify a vehicle located at the <b>parking</b> space via <b>an</b> input sensor or a transceiver that initiates wireless communication with an electronic tag associated with the vehicle; and communicate <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> vacancy associated with the <b>parking</b> space to <b>a</b> remote computing device based {{at least in part}} on the identification of the vehicle. In another example, a computing device can receive parking vacancy data associated with <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> space from <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> controller; determine <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> vacancy associated with the parking space using the parking vacancy data; and encode for display on a client device a network page that includes an indication of the parking vacancy associated with the parking space...|$|R

5|$|An error as to a {{precedent}} fact, if committed, deprives the public authority {{of power to}} take the action or make the decision in question. The existence or non-existence of the fact, {{as the case may}} be, is a condition precedent or prerequisite to the exercise of the power. An example of an error of this nature {{can be found in the}} United Kingdom case White & Collins v. Minister of Health (1939). In that case, under the relevant statute, the authority could only issue a compulsory purchase order affecting the applicants' land if it was not part of, among other things, <b>a</b> <b>park.</b> A minister confirmed the purchase order but the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that it should be quashed, finding that the minister could not exercise power to acquire the land since it was part of <b>a</b> <b>park.</b> Whether the land was or was not <b>a</b> <b>park</b> was {{a precedent}} fact, and the minister had committed an error concerning this fact.|$|E

40|$|Various {{examples}} are provided for smart parking management, which can include navigation. In one example, a system includes a {{base station controller}} configured to: receive a wireless signal from <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> controller located at <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> space; determine <b>a</b> received signal strength indicator (RSSI) from the wireless signal; and identify a presence of a vehicle located at the parking space based {{at least in part}} on the RSSI. In another example, a method includes receiving a wireless signals from a base station controller and <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> controller located at <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> space; determining RSSIs from the wireless signals; and determining a location of the mobile computing device in <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> facility based at least in part on the RSSIs. In another example, a RSSI can be received, <b>a</b> <b>parking</b> occupancy can be determined using the RSSI, and an electronic record can be updated based on the parking occupancy...|$|R
