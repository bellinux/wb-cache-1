Most species (10 of 13) are cave-dwellers with low reproductive rates; {{the area with}} the highest species richness is the Caribbean National Forest, where eleven species occur. The red fig-eating bat (red fruit bat), endemic to the Puerto Rican Bank, plays <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the ecology of tabonuco forest in the Luquillo Mountains since it {{is believed to be}} the only seed disperser of bulletwood (Manilkara bidentata). Cave ecosystems are enhanced by bat feces (guano) since many of the invertebrate cave fauna are either guano scavengers, detritivores or predators of the former two.|$|E
