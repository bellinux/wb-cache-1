5|$|Although {{the mundane}} subject was {{constant}} throughout the Haystack series, the underlying theme {{may be seen}} as the transience of light. This concept enabled Monet to use repetition to show nuances of perception <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> day, the seasons and the weather changed. The almost unvarying subject provided the basis for him to compare changes of light and mood across his nuanced series. The first paintings in the series were started in late September or early October 1890, and he continued producing these paintings for about seven months. These paintings made Monet the first painter to paint such a large quantity of pictures of the same subject matter differentiated by light, weather, atmosphere and perspective.|$|E
5|$|Informally, {{football}} and baseball games had been played at the Maryland Agricultural College as early <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the Civil War. In 1890, an unofficial school team composed mostly of Maryland Agricultural students saw action against local high schools Laurel and Sandy Spring. It was not officially sanctioned by the college, but was allowed to use the school's name. In 1891, the same team played three games against Gallaudet, Hyattsville, and Sandy Spring. The victory over Sandy Spring prompted the MAC faculty to officially recognize the team.|$|E

5|$|Vargas Llosa rose to fame in the 1960s with novels such <b>as</b> <b>The</b> <b>Time</b> <b>of</b> the Hero (La ciudad y los perros, {{literally}} The City and the Dogs, 1963/1966), The Green House (La casa verde, 1965/1968), and {{the monumental}} Conversation in the Cathedral (Conversación en la catedral, 1969/1975). He writes prolifically across {{an array of}} literary genres, including literary criticism and journalism. His novels include comedies, murder mysteries, historical novels, and political thrillers. Several, such as Captain Pantoja and the Special Service (1973/1978) and Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter (1977/1982), have been adapted as feature films.|$|E
5|$|Bores {{are present}} on about 130 {{days in the}} year, {{concentrated}} on the days immediately following the new and full moon. The size and precise timing of the bore depend on such things <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> high tide, the barometric pressure, the wind speed and direction, {{the amount of water}} coming down the river and how well scoured the main drainage channels are. There are a number of viewpoints from which the bore can be seen, or viewers can walk along the river bank or floodbanks. Historically, the bore has been of importance to shipping visiting the docks at Gloucester, but this was alleviated by the construction of an alternative route, the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, which opened in 1827. Nowadays the bore is of more interest to surfers and canoeists who attempt to ride the waves.|$|E

5|$|Sociological {{reasoning}} pre-dates {{the foundation}} of the discipline. Social analysis has origins in the common stock of Western knowledge and philosophy, and has been carried out from as far back <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> ancient Greek philosopher Plato, if not before. The origin of the survey, i.e., the collection of information from a sample of individuals, {{can be traced back to}} at least the Domesday Book in 1086, while ancient philosophers such as Confucius wrote on the importance of social roles. There is evidence of early sociology in medieval Arab writings. Some sources consider Ibn Khaldun, a 14th-century Arab Islamic scholar from North Africa (Tunisia), to have been the first sociologist and father of sociology (see Branches of the early Islamic philosophy); his Muqaddimah was perhaps the first work to advance social-scientific reasoning on social cohesion and social conflict.|$|E
5|$|The see, if such {{it may be}} called, {{appears to}} have existed for a century, if indeed it didn't come into {{existence}} {{in the years after}} Padarn himself. There is note of a bishop of Llanbadarn in the minutes of a synod held at Abberley, Worcestershire, in about the year 603, though this is an unreliable source. Reportedly, at this meeting, there was an unsuccessful attempt by the Archbishop of Canterbury, St Augustine of Canterbury, to persuade Celtic bishops – Llanbadarn Fawr was one of seven present – to submit to his authority. Certainly the reputation of Padarn and the wealth and influence of his clas, ensured that the developing cultus of David did not prevail in northern Ceredigion, possibly in large part due to the extensive lands possessed by the clas, apparently from the river Clarach to the river Rheidol. In some cases, as in the Life of Saint Padarn, the Lives tell how the saint gains lands which <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> writing were claimed by the saint’s foundation as its endowment.|$|E
5|$|Thought to have {{originated}} in prehistoric times, the exact {{early history of}} the Mérens remains a mystery. Theories on its origins include descent from Iberian horses, similar to many regional mountain horses, or possibly Oriental horses brought to the area by settlers from the east. Small black horses from the area of Ariège have been recorded as early <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> Julius Caesar, {{as well as being}} associated with Charlemagne. They pulled artillery for Napoleon's Grand Army, as well as being used by farmers, dock workers, miners and smugglers moving goods through the Pyrenees mountains. They were frequently seen at local horse fairs, and were used to breed mules in a cross with Catalan donkeys. By the end of the 19th century, they had gained a reputation as light cavalry horses. At the same time, however, uncontrolled crossbreeding led to a decline in the purebred population, and in 1908 the local agricultural society was put in charge of the breed. The breed registry was created in 1933, and in 1948 the first stud book was created {{under the control of the}} French National Stud.|$|E

25|$|As {{far back}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the Gloggnitzer Bahn, the railway southwards from Vienna was the busiest in the area.

In contrast to other Viennese stations, the Südbahnhof was relatively undamaged by the Second World War; a small number of bombs fell on it, and a great deal of glass was broken in the fighting in April 1945. The steel framework was largely undamaged and services were soon restarted, although it became clear that renovation works would be necessary.|$|E

25|$|Scurvy {{currently}} is rare. It occurs {{more often in}} the developing world in association with malnutrition. Rates among refugees are reported at 5% to 45%. Scurvy was described as early <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> ancient Egypt. It was a limiting factor in long distance sea travel, often killing large numbers of people. A Scottish surgeon in the Royal Navy, James Lind, was the first to prove it could be treated with citrus fruit in a 1753 publication. His experiments represented the first controlled trial. It took another 40 years before the British Navy began giving out lemon juice routinely.|$|E
25|$|Information science, in {{studying}} the collection, classification, manipulation, storage, retrieval and dissemination of information has origins in the common stock of human knowledge. Information analysis {{has been carried out}} by scholars at least as early <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the Abyssinian Empire with the emergence of cultural depositories, what is today known as libraries and archives. Institutionally, information science emerged in the 19th century along with many other social science disciplines. As a science, however, it finds its institutional roots in the history of science, beginning with publication of the first issues of Philosophical Transactions, generally considered the first scientific journal, in 1665 by the Royal Society (London).|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of paroling enemy troops began {{thousands of years}} ago, at least as early <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> Carthage. Parole allowed the prisoners' captors to avoid the burdens of having to feed and care for them while still avoiding having the prisoners rejoin their old ranks once released; it could also allow the captors to recover their own men in a prisoner exchange. Hugo Grotius, an early international lawyer, favorably discussed prisoner of war parole. During the American Civil War, both the Dix–Hill Cartel and the Lieber Code set out rules regarding prisoner of war parole. Francis Lieber's thoughts on parole later reappeared in the Declaration of Brussels of 1874, the Hague Convention, and the Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War.|$|E
