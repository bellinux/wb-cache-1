5|$|During the Renaissance, architects {{aimed to}} use columns, pilasters, and entablatures as <b>an</b> <b>integrated</b> system.

One of the first buildings to use pilasters as <b>an</b> <b>integrated</b> system was in the Old Sacristy (1421–1440) by Brunelleschi. Arches, semi-circular or (in the Mannerist style) segmental, are often used in arcades, supported on piers or columns with capitals.
