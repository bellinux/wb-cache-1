The proposed uncertainty model is very general {{in that it}} is capable of representing situations in which various distinct sources of uncertainty have to be considered; and realistic {{in that it is}} consistent with the idea that situations featuring simultaneous occurrence of worst-casevalues for all (or a majority of) the task processing times {{do not have to be}} taken into account in the robustness analysis. From the computational point-of-view, a major interest of this uncertainty model is to provide very compact representations of potentially huge uncertainty sets, thus leading to efficient solution algorithms.

The vacant jobs included apprentices, students, specialists as well as management positions. The characteristics that were made anonymous include the applicant’s name and contact details, gender, nationality, date and place of birth, disability, marital status and the applicant’s picture. Additionally, any information about professional experience should only indicate the duration of employment spells and not their <b>actual</b> <b>start</b> <b>date</b> or end date. 2 Importantly, applications were treated anonymously only in the first stage the recruitment process, i.e., when recruiters decide about which candidates to invite for a job interview.

40|$|Critical path {{scheduling}} is a well-developed {{tool for}} construction planning at the project level. A {{substantial amount of}} {{research has focused on}} adding probabilistic capabilities to the technique. Simulation-based methods are almost universally accepted as the most effective because of their modeling versatility and power. Some scheduling models based on simulation recognize correlation between activity durations and allow the probabilistic selection of paths within a network. Very few techniques, however, allow activity duration and sequencing to be defined in terms of the dynamic information that becomes available as a project evolves. This paper presents a program for probabilistic CPM scheduling designed as an add-on to the STROBOSCOPE simulation system. The add-on allows the duration of an activity to be specified as a formula that depends on any scheduling information that may be available when the activity starts. This includes the <b>actual</b> <b>start</b> <b>date</b> and duration of activities already started as well as the dates and floats for activities yet to start. This capability and the ability to combine probabilistic scheduling with construction process simulation make the CPM add-on and the STROBOSCOPE simulation system {{one of the most powerful}} project planning tools available today...|$|E
40|$|Bosch Rexroth Mellansel is a {{manufacturer}} of hydraulic drivesystems for industrial applications. One part of this solution is the hydraulicmotors known as the Hägglunds-engine. Five engine families are manufactured indifferent sizes and for different applications. The purpose of this project wasto investigate four questions regarding three connected steps in themanufacturing of these engines. These steps were washing, assembling andtesting. The desired outcome {{of the project was}} to determine the weakest linksin the production steps, increase the understanding of the process and a coupleof improvement suggestion to increase efficiency of the process. The fourquestions were:· What problems and challenges does each part ofthe process have?· Which are the bottlenecks in the process?· What is the reason for any variations in theproduct flow?· What is the capacity for the product flow?Additionally any suggestions for improvements of the productflow were to be investigated. The following paragraphs describe the results derived duringthe project. What problems and challenges doeseach part of the process have?The most common and most serious problem for the washingstep was the internal delivery delay from manufacturing which daily causedinability to follow the planned production schedule. The study that was madeshowed that 75 % of the identified disturbances in the washing step were causedby internal delivery delay. The most common disturbance in the assembly line was issueswith quality which accounted for 50 % of the discovered disturbances. Examplesof the incidents were insufficient quality of bought components, re-assemblingof motors because of leakage and insufficient marking of components. In the testing step the identified issues were machinefaults, problems downstream and other errors. These faults each accounted foraround 30 % of the incidents. The most severe of these were the issues with thetesting equipment and especially the test bench of the CBM-motors. Problemsdownstream were caused by issues in the painting workshop and during periodsthis caused a massive build up of tested motors at the testing site. The othererrors category was almost exclusively CBM-motors missing paint covering capsand therefore couldn’t be painted. The overall biggest problem was the internal delivery delayswhich accounted for 61 % of the serious problems encountered. Which are the bottlenecks inthe process? Discrete eventsimulation with the program Simio was utilized to investigate this question. Two different cases of production were investigated, quarter 4 2014 and quarter 4 2011. The result can be seen in Tabell 1. What isthe reason for any variations in the product flow?Primarily it was investigated if variation in workload couldbe found in the flow. This was done by doing a day to day comparison of theworkload during quarter 4 2014 and calculate the standard deviation for theperiod. A standard deviation of 15 percentage point was found which indicatedthat issues with variations in workload existed. To investigate if the reason was the internal deliverydelays a comparison was made between the standard deviation of workload in twocases. The first was calculated by using the planned start date of productionand the second by using the <b>actual</b> <b>start</b> <b>date</b> of production. The result showedan increase of the standard deviation by 16. 3 % when using the actual startdates. This showed that the reason of the variation in workload was at leastpartially because failure to follow schedule. What is the capacity of the product flow?The capacity of the workflow was measured by using theearlier made model in Simio. The product mix of quarter 4 2014 was utilized andthe production rate was ramped up until the model no longer could keep up. Theaverage capacity of the production line can be seen in Tabell 2.

The date is given in Owen and Blakeway's 1805 History of Shrewsbury, which gives it also as the date on which the corporation voted Thomas Blake £5 annually as incumbent of St Alkmund's, so it may represent the date of his official confirmation in office, rather than his <b>actual</b> <b>starting</b> <b>date.</b> Rigg {{thought that it was}} here Fisher was [...] "curate to Thomas Blake."

Fisher was a curate alongside Blake, not to him or under him. He replaced James Betton, who had returned to Shrewsbury after it fell to Parliamentarians in February 1645 but later moved to Worthen. The terms were generous: the public preacher's salary of £46 13s. 4d. and an additional £20 from lands bought with a bequest. The other important incumbent in the town centre was Thomas Paget, elected curate of St Chad's by the congregation. He was an older man who had made a considerable impression in 1641 by presenting Parliament with a book by his brother John that advocated a Presbyterian polity.|$|R

40|$|Critical Path Method (CPM) {{scheduling}} {{is currently}} the dominant scheduling system in use in construction. Location Based Management System (LBMS) is increasingly being used as an alternative in the US, particularly in hospital construction. The goal {{of this paper is}} to provide a critical evaluation of one such LBMS implementation by comparing it to a CPM implementation run in parallel. Three hypotheses drove this research. First, LBMS requires more person-hours than CPM to manage the schedule. Second, LBMS provides real-time information to make educated decisions about production control. Third, the subcontractors' <b>start</b> <b>dates</b> are controlled better than their production rates. Both systems are currently being used on a 1 million GSF OSHPD hospital in Northern California. Standard task lists were used to compare the different scheduling time requirements. CPM and LBMS reports were then compared to analyze the different deliverables. Finally, LBMS production data was reviewed against CPM <b>actuals</b> and planned <b>start</b> <b>dates</b> to evaluate the most effective method of subcontractor scope management. The results indicate that more time is required to update the CPM compared to the LBMS schedule on the standard task list. However, CPM supports many legacy processes such as change management.

It is therefore necessary to update previous models, {{such as the one}} produced by Jones (1995), so that the model will be weighted by current weather patterns. Birch pollen data, collected over a period of eleven years (1987 to 1997 inclusive) from three pollen counting stations in the UK, London, Derby and Cardiff, were analysed to determine the <b>start</b> <b>dates</b> using the Sum 75 method. The <b>start</b> <b>dates</b> of the birch pollen seasons of the eleven-year period were then tested for significance against ten-day aggregated variables of temperature and rainfall for each site. The significant variables were entered into multiple regression models until the most valid equation for each site was found. The models were then tested on three years not included in their data sets. The models showed mean differences between <b>actual</b> and predicted <b>start</b> <b>dates,</b> for the eleven years used, of 1. 5, 3 and 5 days at Derby, Cardiff and London respectively. For the test years the mean difference was 1, 4. 5 and 7. 5 days at Derby, Cardiff and London respectively. The most powerful model was for Derby where the corresponding meteorological station is at 0. 5 km distance and the weakest was for London where the corresponding meteorological station is much further away at 21 km distance. Weather variables from early February to mid March were found to be the most influential on the <b>start</b> <b>dates</b> of the birch pollen season at the three sites...|$|R
40|$|While {{the study}} {{pathologist}} (SP) signs the pathology report and is ultimately {{accountable for the}} data, the sponsor peer review pathologist (SPRP) generally signs a peer review (PR) statement indicating agreement with the overall pathology data and the associated interpretations. Additionally, the SPRP is often the initial contact to field internal and regulatory pathology data queries.

The final pathology report should reflect the consensus between the SP and SPRP and appropriately communicate the study findings.

40|$|Critical Path Method (CPM) is the {{standard}} scheduling methodology for building construction in the US. The objective {{of this research is}} to determine the effect of management strategies focusing on early starts (ASAP strategy) on the production and productivity rates of "critical path" tasks in a construction schedule. In this study, two healthcare projects were followed over the course of construction to document the effects of field management decisions on production. On project one, a CPM schedule and ASAP strategy was used exclusively to manage subcontractor resources. On project two, both CPM/ASAP and Location Based Management System (LBMS) strategies were used in parallel, on similar location groups, enabling direct comparison. <b>Actual</b> activity <b>start</b> <b>dates,</b> finish dates, demobilizations and remobilizations, productivity and production rates, and manpower were recorded weekly for analysis. On project one, the actual dates and rates are compared against the CPM plan to determine how reliably the tasks could be completed using the ASAP "work in place" management strategy. Results show that certain deviations from the CPM plan, such as starting early, relocating resources before completing a location, and deploying resources to multiple locations at a time cause unpredictable dates of completion and frequent changes to the "critical path". On project two, actual productivity and production rates for selected tasks are compared between the CPM/ASAP and LBMS location groups. Results show that deploying resources to a location as soon as it is available can {{have a negative effect on}} the productivity and overall production rates of critical tasks. Peer reviewe...|$|R
