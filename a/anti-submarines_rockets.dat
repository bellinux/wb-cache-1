25|$|Anti-submarine {{weapons were}} {{the heart of}} the patrol craft. They {{consisted}} of a 3"/50 caliber gun, depth charges, and <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>rocket</b> launchers known as mousetraps.|$|R
50|$|Tapper boats first {{function}} is to protect and patrol the Swedish coastal waters. Its armament includes 12.7 mm heavy machine guns, <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>Rockets,</b> mines and depth charges.|$|R
50|$|At 1728, as PC-598 {{began the}} {{transition}} from anti-submarine screening to control vessel duties, the crew dropped eight Mousetraps (ASW Mark 20 <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>rockets)</b> and their fuzes overboard.|$|R
50|$|There was a {{modernisation}} programme designated Project 50 A in {{the late}} 1950s early 1960s. This included fitting <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>rocket</b> launchers (RBU-2500) new radar and adding permanent ballast for improved stability.|$|R
50|$|The {{destroyer}} has two double 533 mm torpedo {{tubes and}} two six-barrel RBU-1000 <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>rocket</b> launchers, with 48 rockets. Range is 1,000 m. The rocket is {{armed with a}} 55 kg warhead.|$|R

50|$|This {{class was}} planned {{to become the}} new {{generation}} workhorse of the fleet of the JMSDF. In support of this objective, it was equipped with some new generation weapon and sensor systems such as the ASROC <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>rocket</b> and the OPS-11 early warning radar (Japanese equivalent of the American AN/SPS-40 radar).|$|R

5000|$|In 1980 and 1982, the Yugoslav navy took {{delivery}} of two Soviet Koni class frigates. In 1988 it completed two additional units under license. The Koni frigates were armed with four Soviet P-15 Termit surface-to-surface missile launchers, twin 9K33 Osa (NATO reporting name: SA-8 [...] "Gecko") surface-to-air missiles, and <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>rocket</b> launchers.|$|R

50|$|In August 1992, OBrien {{departed}} San Diego {{to become}} a member of the Forward Deployed Naval Forces. En route from San Diego to Yokosuka, OBrien conducted follow-on testing and evaluation of the vertically launched <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>rocket</b> and the SQQ-89 sonar system on the Pacific Missile Test Range off Kauai, Hawaii. OBrien arrived in Yokosuka, Japan, in October 1992.|$|R
50|$|The Mk 54 can {{be fired}} from surface ships via the Mark 32 surface vessel torpedo tubes or the {{vertical}} launch <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>rocket</b> (ASROC) systems, {{and also from}} most ASW aircraft, although they are slightly different lengths and weights.

25|$|This major {{overhaul}} {{was intended to}} extend a warships' service life and improve sensor and weapon systems. Begun on 28 May, Carpenter received drone antisubmarine helicopter (DASH) support equipment, <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>rocket</b> (ASROC) weapons, and, since the 3-inch/70s had proved a maintenance disaster, a dual 5-inch/38 mount forward. Communication, radar, and sonar upgrades were installed along with general equipment improvements and a helicopter refueling system.|$|R
