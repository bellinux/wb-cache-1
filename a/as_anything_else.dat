5|$|Asked by a {{journalist}} once, {{he said that}} his favourite city was London, and in another instance he said that Mohammed Ali Jinnah had asked him to join the Pakistan Army during the partition in 1947, and in his usual jovial style, commented that if he had joined the Pakistan Army, then India would have been defeated in the 1971 war. The latter remark attracted as much criticism <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> in his career.|$|E
25|$|Philosophers, such as Wittgenstein, take a {{view that}} is {{considered}} anti-realist and oppose philosophical arguments related to God's existence. For instance, Charles Taylor contends that the real is whatever will not go away. If we cannot reduce talk about God to anything else, or replace it, or prove it false, then perhaps God is as real <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{capital of}} British Punjab, the area {{south of the}} Walled City {{contains}} many British colonial municipal structures built in the Indo-Saracenic style, such as the General Post Office, and Lahore Museum. The predominant architectural style {{is a mixture of}} Victorian and Islamic architecture, and {{is often referred to as}} Indo-Gothic. An interesting point about Lahore's architecture is that unlike the emphasis on functional architecture in the west, much of Lahore's architecture has always been about making a statement as much <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E

25|$|Powell {{had voted}} against the Schuman Declaration in 1950 and had {{supported}} entry only because {{he believed that the}} Common Market was simply a means to secure free trade. In March 1969, he opposed Britain's joining the European Economic Community. Opposition to entry had hitherto been confined largely to the Labour Party but now, he said, it was clear to him that the sovereignty of Parliament was in question, as was Britain's very survival as a nation. This nationalist analysis attracted millions of middle-class Conservatives and others, and as much <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> it made Powell the implacable enemy of Heath, a fervent pro-European; but there was already enmity between the two.|$|E
25|$|Elements {{of these}} almost {{forgotten}} fan productions shaped {{many aspects of}} the game. The Technical Manual itself decided the main functions of the Federation Heavy Cruiser, and what other Federation ships looked like. A set of blueprints (probably those drawn by Michael McMaster in 1975) showed the Klingon D7 as having more phasers than the Heavy Cruiser, and disruptors mounted on the engines. The latter became a common feature of Klingon shipbuilding, and the former led to the idea of less powerful phasers for the Klingons. The same blueprints also stated that an older, slightly inferior version of the D7, the D6, was what was sold to the Romulans, and the D7/D6 dichotomy has been {{at the heart of the}} Klingon fleet in the game ever since. Two of the novels gave mention of a phaser being mounted on shuttlecraft. This was included, as much to give a reason to use shuttles <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> This proved to be the wedge that allowed the introduction of fighters to the game; a feature popular with many players, but also led many to believe that Star Fleet Battles was no longer Star Trek.|$|E
25|$|For the {{two years}} {{following}} his graduation from college he studied law at Yale, at Harvard, and in his father's office. In 1863 he {{was admitted to the}} bar and began the practice of law. His seventeen years of service as an associate justice and chief justice of the supreme court of his state and his four years as governor, coming {{as they did in the}} latter part of his life, may have had a tendency to obscure for his later contemporaries the fact that he was at least as much <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> an eminently successful lawyer. In the practice of the law he won distinction both in his own state and outside, and with it the financial emoluments that usually accompany success at the bar. He was keenly alive to the practical side of the lawyer's work and never lost his zest for it. Till almost the very end of his life he maintained a law office, which he visited daily as long as his health would permit, and kept adding to his law library. As late as 1919 his book The Young Man and the Law revealed him still at heart a lawyer. In 1878, he was one of the founders of the American Bar Association and served as President of the American Bar Association from 1890-1891. For twelve years (1907–1919) he was the director of the American Bar Association's Comparative Law Bureau (as well as its Annual Bulletins editor for general jurisprudence).|$|E

500|$|The NME had {{reservations}} however, {{stating that}} although the album is [...] "easily as engaging and full of the wild possibilities of pop music <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> in their peerless canon" [...] it is [...] "not quite up there with Radiator due to its brace of shonky ballad filler ("Cloudberries" [...] and [...] "Cabin Fever")". Writing for Allmusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine was largely impressed with Love Kraft but admitted to being disappointed that it is [...] "merely a very good Super Furry Animals effort, with few surprises outside of its alluring sleek". The band's singer, Gruff Rhys, has described the album as [...] "the most beautiful record we've made ... really orchestral and fairly timeless".|$|E

500|$|Music critic Keith Harris of Rolling Stone wrote, [...] "Janet Jackson has {{abandoned}} the plastic R of 2006's 20 Y.O. for a sexier brand of digitized megapop [...] you can dismiss any {{images of the}} abusive Jackson clan that flit into your mind. Just lie back and enjoy the sensations as pure aural autoeroticism." [...] Andy Kellman of Allmusic gave a four-out-of-five star rating, noting several tracks were [...] "as innocent, universal, and inviting <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> in Janet's past", and called the songs [...] "Rock with U" [...] and [...] "2Nite" [...] "irresistible, grade-A dancefloor tracks". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine described it as Jackson's [...] "most cohesive album in a while", giving three-out-of-five stars. Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK gave it seven out of ten stars saying [...] "Still, if not perfect, there's plenty to like on Discipline, and while {{none of it is}} exactly vintage Janet, there's enough here to keep the Jackson name on pop's A-list for a little while longer." ...|$|E
500|$|Film scholar Richard Dyer {{highlights}} several intelligent devices used by Argento in {{the editing}} of the film, noting that interpolated sequences are sometimes punctuated by [...] "shots of pills {{and the sound}} of running water." [...] Steffen Hantke believes that the shock cuts {{in the latter part of}} the film are among cinema's [...] "most brutal and stylized", and exhibit a degree of abstract expressionism. Film scholar Leon Hunt argues that the devices and themes utilized by Argento in the making of Tenebrae make it as much an example of art cinema <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else.</b> The initial murders are shot in a [...] "clipped montage style", which is later revealed to be reflecting the use of a camera by the first killer to record the scene. Giuliano Gemma later said that Argento fostered an improvisational atmosphere on set. One example he gave was the scene where his character bends to pick up some evidence from the floor, only to reveal Neal behind him having perfectly matched his position relative to the camera. This moment was not scripted, but resulted from Argento's noticing the actors' similar build while they were stood, one behind the other in front of him.|$|E
500|$|Hail to the Thief has a {{score of}} 85 out of 100 on review {{aggregate}} site Metacritic, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". Neil McCormick, writing for The Daily Telegraph, called Hail to the Thief [...] "Radiohead firing on all cylinders, a major work by major artists {{at the height of}} their powers." [...] Chris Ott of Pitchfork wrote that Radiohead had [...] "largely succeeded in their efforts to shape pop music into as boundless and possible a medium as it should be," [...] assigning it a [...] "Best New Music" [...] designation. Writing for New York, Ethan Brown said that Hail to the Thief [...] "isn't a protest album, and that's why it works so well. As with great Radiohead records past, such as Kid A, the music – restlessly, freakishly inventive – pushes politics far into the background." [...] Andy Kellman of AllMusic wrote that [...] "despite the fact that it seems more like a bunch of songs on a disc rather than a singular body, its impact is substantial", concluding that the band [...] "have entered a second decade of record-making with a surplus of momentum. In Mojo, Peter Paphides wrote that Hail to the Thief [...] "coheres as well <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> in their canon".|$|E

500|$|Spurs won the 1949–50 Second Division {{title with}} seven games to spare, scoring more goals and conceding fewer {{than any of}} their rivals, and were {{promoted}} to the First Division for the following season. In August 1950, shortly before Tottenham embarked on their first top-flight season since they had been relegated {{at the end of}} the 1934–35 campaign, Rowe told the club's annual meeting: [...] "As much <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> I would rate our good time last year to the acquisition of Alf Ramsey." [...] After an uncertain start to the 1950–51 season, Spurs quickly recovered their form of the previous year and by Christmas were top of the table. Ramsey continued to play a key role, according to McKinstry playing [...] "the best football of his life": [...] "He was the master of strategy, the lynchpin of a side that built its attacks from the back, the scheming practitioner who put Rowe's plans into action." [...] His understanding of the game and authority on and off the field led to his teammates nicknaming him [...] "The General". On 28 April 1951, with a 1–0 home victory over Sheffield Wednesday, Tottenham were crowned champions of England only a year after promotion. [...] "I think fortune shone upon me very handsomely during the 1950–51 season," [...] Ramsey remarked in Talking Football—"After all, I was a member of one of the finest club teams in years".|$|E
500|$|In January 2015, Disney officially {{began the}} film's {{marketing}} campaign by releasing a miniature [...] "ant-sized" [...] teaser trailer, a full-sized {{version of the}} same teaser trailer, a poster, a cover on Entertainment Weekly, and a full-length trailer during the premiere of the television series Agent Carter. Scott Mendelson of Forbes, said, [...] "It was darn-clever for Disney to put out a miniature 'can't see anything without a microscope' version of the now-standard trailer for the trailer. I sighed just a little when they 'gave in' and released a human-sized version, realizing that Disney had just released what amounted to a teaser to a teaser to a trailer... But nonetheless, credit where credit is due, Disney was able to turn a single theatrical trailer into three separate news drops in about five days." [...] Mendelson {{went on to say that}} [...] "the peppy, witty trailer above is a general audience sell. Marvel knows the geeks will come if only to throw stones, but it's the mainstream audience that needs to be sold. So far, so good." [...] However, Graeme McMillan of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the trailer for its placement during the broadcast premiere of Agent Carter, its tone, its soundtrack, and for being thematically similar to other trailers from Marvel Studios. McMillan concluded, [...] "The Ant-Man trailer isn't bad, per se; it is, however, impressively underwhelming, which almost seems worse. Thanks to the last-minute exit of original writer-director Edgar Wright and the subsequent struggle to find a replacement, Ant-Man has become the movie that people are expecting to be Marvel's first failure, in critical if not financial terms, at least; this trailer, which fails to convince and gets by on goodwill for those involved and the Marvel brand as much <b>as</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else,</b> doesn't do enough — or anything, really — to persuade audiences that that's not the case." [...] The trailer generated 29 million views worldwide in three days, the third-largest viewership for a Marvel Studios film, behind trailers for Iron Man 3 and Avengers: Age of Ultron.|$|E
