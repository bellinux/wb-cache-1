The fraction of {{palm kernel oil}} namely lauric acid (AL) was <b>amidificationed</b> with N-methyl glucamine (MGL) to produce lauroyl-N-methyl glucamide. Study {{was carried out by}} using immobilized lipase from Candida antarctica (Novozyme 435 ®), and tert-amylalcohol as a solvent. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based on a five level, three variable design was employed, firstly, for studying the interactive effect of various parameters on the reaction, and secondly, for the optimization. The reaction parameters observed were Novozyme concentration, substrate molar ratio, and temperature. Simultaneously increasing Novozyme concentration, substrate molar ratio, and temperature improves the reaction yield and the effect of temperature is noted more significant. The expected optimum condition was at molar ratio MGL:AL 1 : 1, the Novozyme concentration of 8 % and the reaction temperature of 50 - 55 °C.

Polyurethanes (PUs) were then obtained by reaction with a commercially available diisocyanate (MDI prepolymer). It was shown that thermostability of PUs was higher when using ester-containing pseudo-telechelic diols.

40|$|The nitrile imine-mediated tetrazole-ene cycloaddition {{reaction}} (NITEC) {{is introduced}} {{as a powerful}} and versatile conjugation tool to covalently ligate macromolecules onto variable (bio) surfaces. The NITEC approach is initiated by UV irradiation and proceeds rapidly at ambient temperature yielding a highly fluorescent linkage. Initially, the formation of block copolymers by the NITEC methodology is studied to evidence its efficacy as a macromolecular conjugation tool. The grafting of polymers onto inorganic (silicon) and bioorganic (cellulose) surfaces is subsequently carried out employing the optimized reaction conditions obtained from the macromolecular ligation experiments and evidenced by surface characterization techniques, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and FT-IR microscopy. In addition, the patterned immobilization of variable polymer chains onto profluorescent cellulose is achieved through a simple masking process during the irradiation. Photoinduced nitrile imine-alkene 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition (NITEC) is employed to covalently bind well-defined polymers onto silicon oxide or cellulose. A diaryl tetrazole-functionalized molecule is grafted via silanization or <b>amidification,</b> respectively.

40|$|Cellulose is an {{environmentally}} friendly material which is obtainable in vast quantities, {{since it is}} present in every plant. Cellulosic fibers are commercially found in two forms: natural (flax, hemp, cotton, sisal, wood, etc.) and regenerated cellulose fibers (RCF). The biodegradability, the morphological and mechanical properties make these fibers a good alternative to the synthetic reinforcement (e. g. glass fibers). However, as all other cellulosic fibers these materials also have similar drawbacks, such as sensitivity to moisture and poor adhesion with polymers. The {{first part of this}} work concerned a heterogeneous modiﬁcation of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) by using esteriﬁcation and <b>amidiﬁcation</b> to attach long aliphatic chains. Long-chain aliphatic acid chlorides and amines were used as grafting reagents. Surface grafting with acyl chains was confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was found that the degree of substitution (DS) of the surface is highly dependent on the method of modification. The contact angle measurement showed that after modification, the surface of CNC was found to be hydrophobic. The second part was devoted to modification of RCF by CNC using Isocyanatopropyl triethoxysilane as coupling agent. Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis were performed to verify the degree of modification. The mechanical properties of the unmodified and modified fibers were analyzed using fiber bundle tensile static and loading–unloading tests. To show the effect of cellulose whiskers grafting on the Cordenka fibers, epoxy based composites were manufactured and tensile tests done on transverse uni-directional specimens. It was found that the mechanical properties were significantly increased by fiber modification and addition of the nano-phase into composite reinforced with micro- sized fibers.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this project was to apply the principles of green chemistry to selected traditional synthetic organic chemistry reactions. The reactions studied in the lab were: amide formation, oxidation of alcohols with KMnO 4 and LiCl/H 2 O 2, oxidation of alkylarenes with KMnO 4, reduction of β-ketoesters with yeast, and formation of esters by phase transfer catalysis. Microwave irradiation, biocatalysis, phase transfer catalysis, solvent-free conditions, and/or alternate solvents were used to accomplish these syntheses. Results were analyzed by the traditionally used percent yield calculations and selected green chemistry metrics. The main limitation of the results was that most products were not completely purified due to time constraints. 	For <b>amidification</b> {{it was found that}} results obtained using a commercial oven were better than results obtained using a domestic oven. Oxidation with KMnO 4 gave higher yields at one week reaction time under solvent-free conditions than under reflux in dichloromethane for 1. 5 h. The catalytic oxidation procedure using LiCl/H 2 O 2 was found to be more wasteful than the stoichiometric procedure using KMnO 4. Both methods showed preference for oxidation at benzylic as opposed to aliphatic positions. For the oxidation of alkylarenes it was found that dimethylcarbonate is not a suitable replacement for dichloromethane as an extraction solvent in this procedure. Also, higher yields were obtained at one week reaction time under solvent-free conditions than under reflux in dichloromethane for 1. 5 h. product analysis for reduction of β-keotesters with yeast tend to suggest that steric factors may play a large role in the reaction with more sterically hindered substrates giving lower yields. Further work in this area is required to elucidate this hypothesis. Only a few esterification reactions were carried out but two of three results gave decent E-factors. Finally, it was shown that the majority of waste from each reaction was from the use of solvent. Therefore, recycling the solvent can have the biggest impact on reducing waste. ...|$|E
40|$|Cellulosic fibres (flax, hemp, {{regenerated}} cellulose) possess decent {{mechanical properties}} {{and they are}} gaining interest {{as an alternative to}} synthetic reinforcement (e. g. glass fibres) in polymers to reduce the petroleum consumption and pollution. In particular, manmade Regenerated Cellulose Fibres (RCF) have been extensively studied as potential reinforcement in polymer composites. For high performances where stability is highly required, RCF among the cellulosic fibres are well qualified due the advantage of being continuous with regular cross section. However, the hydrophilic character and the sensitivity to moisture reduce the use of fibres based cellulose in composite applications. Indeed, the moisture absorption and the low compatibility leading to weak fibre/matrix interface are major factors behind the less interest of utilizing cellulosic fibres in composite intended for high performances. The short term objective of this thesis was to improve the resistance to moisture and the adhesion of regenerated cellulose fibres (RCF) commercialized under the trade name CORDENKA 700 super 3 to Epoxy matrix through chemical treatments by cellulose nano-crystals via silane coupling agents. In Paper I chemical treatments of cellulose nano-crystals using (CNC) esterification and <b>amidification</b> to attach long aliphatic chains is studied. The treatment was successfully achieved as confirmed by spectroscopic characterisations and led to a decrease of the moisture absorption. Contact angle measurement showed hydrophobic of CNC after treatment. In Paper II, CNC extracted from wastes of date palm tree were grafted on RCF fibres to create hierarchical structure. The effect of grafting CNC on RCF was evaluated by tensile tests both in static and loading-unloading. In fact, treatments were revealed to change slightly the microstructure where the orientation of both crystalline and amorphous phases where re-oriented as X-ray analysis showed. Grafted fibres based unidirectional composite were manufactured and transversally tested. Both mechanical properties and resistance to crack were significantly increased by fibre modification. Another approach for chemical modification of RCF fibres was developed in Paper III. In this paper, the process of modification of RCF by CNC is more environmentally friendly. The γ-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS) was used as coupling agent to attach the CNC onto the fibres. This treatment involves a mixture of water and ethanol as solvents and was run at relatively low temperature. The impact of the treatment on fibres was scrutinised after each treatment basically by MPS and after grafting CNC. Results showed that the modification by silane decreased the stiffness and strength of fibres while the strain at failure was increased. However, after grafting CNC, stiffness and strain at failure were recovered while the strength remained at the same order of magnitude as for fibres treated only by the coupling agent. The effect of these treatments on moisture absorption and on the adhesion with epoxy matrix was the focus of the Paper IV. In this paper, it was shown that at high relative humidity (RH= 64 %) the treatment by CNC decreased water uptake by factor of two compare to untreated fibres. Besides, the treatments by CNC at different concentrations lessened the impact of moisture on stiffness and strength of fibres after exposure to the same humidity level (RH= 64 %). Moreover, the pull-out test performed on fibre bundles showed that the adhesion between fibre and matrix is less affected by moisture (samples conditioned at RH= 64 %) for CNC grafted fibres compare to untreated fibres. The treatment process by MPS was Scaled-up to Non-Crimp Fabric in Paper V and the interlaminar properties of composites reinforced with RCF were studied. Double cantilevered beam (DCB) test was used to characterize fracture toughness, under static and fatigue loading. Regenerated cellulose fibres exhibit highly nonlinear behaviour and strongly influence the performance of their composites. The obtained fracture toughness values were significantly high compared to those of synthetic fibre reinforced composites. However, due to the high nonlinearity, a concrete conclusion was not easy to make on the effect of fibre treatment on the materials performance. Thus, scanning electron microscopy studies were carried out on fracture surfaces which confirmed the treatment effect, qualitatively, on the improvement of interfacial adhesion.

40|$|Dissertation Proposal for Jeffrey Trautmann Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) is a {{technique}} that destroys oncogenic (cancerous) cells. It {{has been used in}} several countries since the 1980 ’s. Molecules that contain chromophores can function as photosensitizers, and will absorb light at various wavelengths (that being dependent upon the extent of their conjugation). Certain functional groups, upon absorption of light, can be used to convert O 2 to singlet oxygens which are destructive to the cellular environment. Once an in-vitro cell contains a high enough concentration of photosensitizer material and light is able to reach the photosensitizer material, PDT can be used effectively to destroy that cell. 1 - 3 Folic acid (vitamin B 9) 1 is an important material for cellular function. In particular, folate, a metabolite of folic acid, is necessary for DNA biosynthesis and repair, and ultimately for cell growth. When cells, (cancerous or healthy) are deprived of normal amounts of folic acid and then later introduced to a surplus, their rate of folic acid uptake becomes exaggerated. Under these conditions, cancerous cells, due to exhibiting unregulated proliferation, tend to exhibit folic acid uptake at a significantly greater rate than healthy cells. 4 Dyes, porphyrins, and chlorophylls have been studied for use as photosensitizers in PDT. Porphyrins and many chlorophylls contain macrocyclic systems that coordinate with various metal cations (often heavy in molecular mass) through heteroatom ligand formation. Dyes are not inherently macrocyclic, and they tend to have a lower molecular mass, making them more applicable for oral bio-availability. Phenothiazine 2, a relatively small chromophore-containing dye, can be amide-linked to folic acid with the appropriate carbon tether to create a molecule that has a molecular mass less than 700 g/mol. Additionally, the nitrogen and the sulfur functionalities of phenothiazine offer opportunity for N-O and/or S-O oxide formation, enabling photo-induced generation of destructive oxygen radicals. The cells of skin-visible tumors are within close proximity to the skin surface, thus allowing skin-penetrating light to reach their cellular environment. By introducing phenothiazine-tethered folamides to the cells of a tumor, it is hoped that PDT will be able to effectively destroy the tumor. 5 - 7 Concurrent studies have employed the use of phenothiazine derivative 3, 7 -dibromophenothiazine 3 as a precursor for preparing photosensitizers via Buchwald-Hartwig and/or Ullmann methodology. A model system was considered that would provide NMR spectra illustrating well-resolved peaks for the purpose of developing the methodologies of the project. Comparison of 4 -bromoaniline 4 with 3 revealed that they both have a nitrogen atom with a pair of non-bonding electrons that can function as an electron donor to a benzene ring, and a bromine at the position para to the nitrogen. Based on these comparisons, it was believed that 4 would make a suitable analog of 3 for use in a model system. A molecule was also needed to serve {{as an alternative to the}} short-chained linker (2 -hydroxyethanamine) previously used to tether phenothiazine analogs to folic acid. 4 offered a nitrogen atom that could be joined to folic acid via <b>amidification,</b> and a bromine leaving group that could be used by the same Buchwald-Hartwig or Ullmann coupling methodology previously employed. Furthermore, the planarity of 4 -bromoaniline offered reduced sterics, thereby facilitating both N-acylations and transition metal couplings. This led to the belief that 4 -bromoaniline would also make a suitable linker for tethering phenothiazine analogs to folic acid. A comparison between 2 and carbazole 6 derivatives is also underway. The use of a carbomethoxy ester benzyl protecting group allows for coupling of the selected destructive dye to folic acid. Previous studies by P. Low et al. 8 demonstrated that polyethylene glycol (PEG) can be used as a spacer between fluorescent liposomes (spherical vessels capable of serving as a vehicle for nutrients and pharmaceuticals) and folate. It was found that tumor-specific delivery could be obtained by using short PEG chains (less than 2000 units in length) with small-size liposomes (less than 100 nm in diameter). Crocetin 12, a potential anti-cancer agent, can be installed as a tether in order to boost UV activity. 9 - 10 Most recently, L. Donahue (Loyola University Chicago) has reported a PEG-folate conjugate that in-part resembles those prepared by Low, in that it consists of a 2000 ethylenedioxy unit linker. Donahue’s target, 16 a, exhibits nearly quantitative death within HeLa (immortal-line oncogenic) cells at micromolar concentrations within 120 seconds of exposure to 660 nm light. Pure Chlorin-e 6 was also shown by Donahue to kill cells, although to a lesser extent than the conjugate. This research will focus on preparative synthesis and delivery of folate-linked photosensitizer precursors to folate receptors on cancer cells. Optimization of protection-deprotection sequences, metal-catalyzed oxidative additions, esterifications, and amidifications are of significance. Additional chlorin-e 6 -PEG-folate conjugates containing ethylenedioxy units approximating 3, 400, 10, 000, and 20, 000 in number are to be prepared (16 b-d, respectively). Preparation of certain carotenoids (crocetin) and dyes (phenothiazine-based and carbazole-based carbomethoxy esters) are also being explored as potential photosensitizer precursors. Methods of compound analysis are to include proton-NMR, TLC, and melting point. Exposure of these conjugates to near-IR light for 5. 0 µM and 0. 5 µM concentrations in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) are to be conducted at intervals of 1 min, 2 min, 4 min, and 6 min. Graphs summarizing in-vitro results will be generated. Experimental Methyl- 4 -(9 H-phenothiazin- 9 -yl) methyl) benzoate (8).
