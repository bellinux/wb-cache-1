50|$|Most {{automated}} {{telephone exchanges}} use digital switching rather than mechanical or <b>analog</b> <b>switching.</b> The trunks connecting the exchanges are also digital, called circuits or channels. However analog two-wire circuits are still used {{to connect the}} last mile from the exchange to the telephone in the home (also called the local loop). To carry a typical {{phone call from a}} calling party to a called party, the analog audio signal is digitized at an 8 kHz sample rate with 8-bit resolution using a special type of nonlinear pulse code modulation known as G.711. The call is then transmitted from one end to another via telephone exchanges. The call is switched using a call set up protocol (usually ISUP) between the telephone exchanges under an overall routing strategy.|$|E
50|$|The PCM30-base system, the <b>analog</b> <b>switching</b> {{technology}} in Europe, and {{served on the}} digital transmission of telephone traffic. It has 30 coders, each with a phone channel in an 8-bit digital word (byte) can implement. The 30 bytes are, together with a frame ID word, and a channel identifier, bytewise successively sent (see Multiplexer). Thus, a large 32-byte frame. In receiving direction, the 30 channels are, using a de-multiplexer, converted back to 30 analogue signals. The time slot 0 {{is used as a}} frame ID word, and as word detection is used. These are sent alternately. Time slot 16 is a channel identifier for the speech channels. Each voice channel is assigned 4 bits, one after the other in 16, there is an over-under with a frequency of 500 Hz and a length of 16 ⋅ 32 ⋅ 8 # 4096 bits.|$|E

5000|$|The Very Compact Digital Exchange (VCDX) was {{developed}} with the 5ESS-2000, and marketed to mostly non-Bell telephone companies as an inexpensive, {{effective way to}} offer ISDN and other digital services in an <b>analog</b> <b>switching</b> center. This avoided the capital expense of retrofitting the entire analog switch into a digital one to serve all of the switch's lines when many wouldn't require it and would remain POTS lines. An example would be the (former) GTE/Verizon Class-5 telephone switch, the GTD-5 EAX. Like the Western Electric 1ESS/1AESS, it served mostly medium to large wire centers. The standalone VCDX was also capable of serving as a switch for very small wire centers (a CDX- Community dial office) of fewer than ~400 lines. However, for small wire centers, 400-4000 lines, that function was usually served by RSM's, a 5ESS [...] "Remote SM". The RSM is controlled over redundant and diverse fiber optic [...] "umbilicals". An RSM can {{have more than one}} SM, and also many other peripheral units that are part of a full 5ESS switch. An RSM can serve parts of a larger metro area, but is more often used as a Class-5 wire center for small to medium towns hosted from a 5ESS located in a larger city.The VCDX was also used as a large private branch exchange (PBX). The standalone VCDX has a single Switching Module, and no Communications Module. Its Sun Microsystems SPARC workstation runs the UNIX-based Solaris (operating system) that executes a 3B20/21D processor MERT OS emulation system, acting as the VCDX's Administrative Module. The VCDX uses the CO's normal telephone power sources (which are very large uninterruptible power supply's), and has connections to the CO Digital cross connect system for T1 access, etc.|$|E

In such applications, <b>analog</b> <b>switching</b> {{with an increase in}} the synaptic weights can mimic through the homogeneous RS, whereas the better resistance retention properties can be achieved through filamentary RS [11]. To check the suitability of Al/MnO 2 /SS thin film MIM device for neuromorphic application, we have plotted the maximum positive (ISET) and negative current (IRESET) with different sweep rates at different resistive switching voltages and analog memory as shown in Fig.  5 a–d, respectively. It is observed that the current increases in both the bias regions with an increase in voltage sweeps and sweep rates. In the biological synapse, improvement in the strength of synaptic weights results in the better learning [33]. In many memristive-based electronic synapses, current (i) was considered as synaptic weights [33, 34, 35].
