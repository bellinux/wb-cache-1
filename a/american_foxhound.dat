5000|$|Scent hounds do {{not need}} to be as fast as sight hounds, because they {{do not need}} to keep prey in sight, but they need {{endurance}} so that they can stick with a scent and follow it for long distances over rough terrain. The best scent hounds can follow a scent trail even across running water and even when it is several days old. Most scent hounds are used for hunting in packs of multiple dogs. Longer-legged hounds run more quickly and usually require that the hunters follow on horseback; shorter-legged hounds allow hunters to follow on foot. Hunting with some breeds, such as German Bracke, <b>American</b> <b>Foxhounds,</b> or coonhounds, involves allowing the pack of dogs to run freely while the hunters wait in a fixed spot until the dogs' baying announces that the game has been [...] "treed". The hunters then go to the spot on foot, following the sound of the dogs' baying.|$|R

5000|$|... ==History== [...] In 1650, Robert Brooke sailed from England to Crown Colony in North America {{with his}} pack of hunting dogs, {{which were the}} root of several strains of American Hounds. Dogs of this {{bloodline}} remained in the Brooke family for nearly 300 years. George Washington received French Foxhounds, Grand Bleu de Gascogne, (which look much like an American Bluetick Coonhound) as {{a gift from the}} Marquis de Lafayette. Many of the dogs Washington kept were descended from Brooke's, and when crossed with the French hounds, helped to create the present day <b>American</b> <b>Foxhound.</b> The <b>American</b> <b>Foxhound</b> is known to have originated in the states of Maryland and Virginia, and is the state dog of Virginia. Though there has long been a rumor that the new breed was originally used for hunting Indigenous peoples of the Americas, this is not true. The breed was developed by landed gentry purely for the sport of hunting foxes. With the importation (or migration) of the red fox, Irish Foxhounds were added to the lines, to increase speed and stamina in the dog, qualities still prevalent in today's dogs. One quality that the <b>American</b> <b>Foxhound</b> is famous for is its musical bay that can be heard for miles. This is actually one reason why this breed does not do well in city settings. The breed was first recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1886. Today, there are many different strains of <b>American</b> <b>Foxhound,</b> including Walker, Calhoun, Goodman, Trigg, July and Penn-Marydel. Though each strain looks quite different, they are all recognized as members of the same breed. Most show hounds are Walkers, many of the pack hounds (used with hunting foxes on horseback) are Penn-Marydel and hunters use a variety of strains to suit their hunting style and quarry.|$|E
5000|$|... ===Activity level=== The <b>American</b> <b>Foxhound</b> is a {{very active}} breed and very high energy. They {{require a lot of}} {{exercise}} and do best in habitats where they have room to run. If they live in a suburban area such as a neighborhood, they should have a fenced in yard and be taken on multiple walks daily.|$|E
50|$|The <b>American</b> <b>foxhounds</b> are lighter, {{taller and}} more agile than the English ones. They can grow to {{a height of}} 21-25 inches and can weigh between 65 and 75 pounds. These dogs have {{a keen sense of}} smell and are faster than other hounds. They are large dogs with long, straight-boned front legs and a large skull with pendant ears which frame the face. The ears are wide and flat to the head. The eyes are wide set and large with a {{friendly}} and intelligent expression. The tail is set moderately high with a slight upward curve and the coat is hard and short, and as the name suggests, a combination of black and tan on a white base. These dogs are not suitable to apartment living because they need a lot of exercise and also tend to put on weight easily. Otherwise, they are fairly healthy and not plagued by genetic disorders involving the hip and bones. Their life span is about 10-12 years. This breed has a friendly, pleasant, loyal and reliable temperament.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a model of {{sustained}} neurogenic hypertension in the dog. Thirteen female <b>American</b> <b>foxhounds</b> (mean arterial pressure 105 ± 12 mm Hg) with Indwelling arterial and venous cannulas were maintained on a constant 82 mEq/day sodium intake. After a control period of at least 10 days, under pentothal anesthesia and direct visualization, the animals had placement of bilateral elec-trical lesions of the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) at the level of the obex. After recovery from anesthesia, the dogs could be divided into two groups on the basis of blood pressure response. Group I (n = 6) developed sustained hypertension with an increase of mean arterial pressure of 25 - 35 % above control values (p < 0. 01) for 10 days after placement of the lesions. Group II (n = 7) had a transient increase of blood pressure on postoperative Day 1 but became nonnotensive for the subsequent 9 days of observation. The bemodynamic features of the dogs in Group I were increased total peripheral resistance, decreased cardiac output and slightly decreased heart rate; these changes were reversed to control by pbetolamine. Plasma renin activity, aldosterone concentration and blood pressure response to SQ 20, 881 were unchanged by NTS lesions. Group I dogs had sodium retention on postoperative Day 1, but no change in renal plasma flow or glomerular filtration rate was observed during the chronic hypertensive phase. One Group I dog remained hypertensive for 8 weeks. All dogs in Group I were hypertensive and all in Group II were nonnotensive at sacrifice. Histologic section...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of EntomologyMarcelo Ramalho-OrtigaoSand flies (Diptera:Psychodidae) are vectors of parasites if {{the genus}} Leishmania, the causative agent of leishmaniasis, a {{neglected}} tropical disease {{in several countries}} around the world. Sand flies transmit Leishmania to suitable vertebrates during the blood meal and following a complex development parasites undergo within the fly. Many aspects of the Leishmania development within the sand fly vector are well known, however details about how sand fly molecules affect the parasite are still not yet known. Our group previously identified that RNAi knockdown of PpChit 1, a midgut specific chitinase from the sand fly Phlebotomus papatasi, led to {{a significant decrease in}} the load of Le. major. In this study, we assessed potential fitness effects of antisera anti-PpChit 1 on three laboratory-reared sand fly species (P. papatasi, Phlebotomus duboscqi, and Lutzomyia longipalpis). Our results suggest that feeding sand flies with anti-PpChit 1 sera led to a one day delay in the onset of oviposition, and also suggested that anti-PpChit 1 -fed flies survived on average up to three days longer that control flies. Analyses of the peritrophic matrix (PM) indicated a significant increase in thickness 72 hours post anti-PpChit 1 feeding compared to control sera. Altogether the results suggest that feeding sand flies with anti-PpChit 1 likely affects the kinetics of sand PM, which in turn affects the flow of nutrients and certain aspects of sand fly fitness. In the course of this study, we also evaluated the ability of <b>American</b> <b>Foxhounds</b> naturally infected with Leishmania infantum to transmit these parasites via bites of phlebotomine sand flies to suitable vertebrates. Since 1999, an outbreak of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) has been reported in the U. S especially among Foxhounds. The ability of sand flies to pick up and transmit this pathogen represents an important health risk for companion dogs and humans. Our results indicate that Foxhounds naturally infected with Le. infantum are highly infectious to sand flies and that the parasites are able to fully develop within these vectors and de successfully transmitted during blood feeding. Thus, the risk exists for these parasites to become endemic in North America where sand flies are also known to occur...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Autogenous bone is {{the most}} {{successful}} bone-grafting material; however, multiple disadvantages continue to drive developments of improved methods for bone regeneration. AIM: The aim {{of the present study}} was to test the hypothesis that an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) modified polyethylene glycol-based matrix (PEG) containing covalently bound peptides of the parathyroid hormone (PTH(1 - 34)) enhances bone regeneration to a degree similar to autogenous bone. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Six <b>American</b> <b>foxhounds</b> received a total of 48 cylindrical titanium implants placed in the mandible between the first premolar and the second molar. Five, respectively, 7 months following tooth extraction, implants were placed into the center of surgically created defects. This resulted in a circumferential bone defect simulating an alveolar defect with a circular gap of 1. 5 mm. Four treatment modalities were randomly allocated to the four defects per side: (1) PEG-matrix containing 20 microg/ml of PTH(1 - 34), and 350 microg/ml cys-RGD peptide, (2) PEG alone, (3) autogenous bone and (4) empty defects. Histomorphometric analysis was performed 4 and 12 weeks after implantation. The area fraction of newly formed bone was determined within the former defect and the degree of bone-to-implant contact (BIC) was evaluated both in the defect region and in the apical region of the implant. For statistical analysis ANOVA and subsequent pairwise Student's t-test were applied. RESULTS: Healing was uneventful and all implants were histologically integrated. Histomorphometric analysis after 4 weeks showed an average area fraction of newly formed bone of 41. 7 +/- 1. 8 % for matrix-PTH, 26. 6 +/- 4. 1 % for PEG alone, 43. 9 +/- 4. 5 % for autogenous bone, and 28. 9 +/- 1. 5 % for empty defects. After 12 weeks, the respective values were 49. 4 +/- 7. 0 % for matrix-PTH, 39. 3 +/- 5. 7 % for PEG alone, 50. 5 +/- 3. 4 % for autogenous bone and 38. 7 +/- 1. 9 % for empty defects. Statistical analysis after 4 and 12 weeks revealed significantly more newly formed bone in the PTH(1 - 34) group compared with PEG alone or empty defects, whereas no difference could be detected against autogenous bone. Regarding BIC no significant difference was observed between the four treatment groups neither at 4 nor at 12 weeks. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that an RGD-modified PEG hydrogel containing PTH(1 - 34) is an effective matrix system to obtain bone regeneration...|$|R
50|$|The <b>American</b> <b>Foxhound</b> is {{taller and}} rangier than its cousin, the English Foxhound. Also, this breed {{is known to}} have a musical bark, called a bay, when it is hunting that can be heard for miles, {{probably}} inherited from the Grand Bleu de Gascogne's signature howl. If competing in a dog show, some physical characteristics that judges would look for would be a slightly domed skull, long, large ears, large eyes, straight muzzle, well laid-back shoulders, a moderately long back, fox-like feet, and a slightly curved tail. Though they are traditionally tri-colored (black, white and tan) they can be any color. They are one of the rarest breeds in the American Kennel Club.|$|E

For years it was traditional to feed Foxhounds on a diet of [...] "dog bread", a variation on cornbread. The legs of a Foxhound are very long and straight-boned. The foxhound's chest is rather narrow. It has a long muzzle, and a large, domed skull. The ears are wide and low-set. The eyes are hazel or brown, and are large and wide-set.|$|E
50|$|The Black and Tan Virginia Foxhound is an <b>American</b> <b>foxhound</b> breed. It {{resulted}} {{of a cross}} breed with Bloodhounds in the 1700s. The breed {{was developed}} by the landed gentry {{in order to get a}} dog suitable for fox hunting. Besides the Black and Tan there are the Walker, Calhoun, Penn-Marydel, Goodman, July and Trigg, which all developed from similar crosses. The Black and Tan is believed to descend form hunting dogs imported to America by Robert Brooke in 1650. These hunting dogs were the ancestors of several varieties of American hounds and stayed with the Brooke family for more than 300 years. Afterwards French Foxhounds were bred in after George Washington received them as gifts from the Marquis de Lafayette. Much later, the breed's speed and stamina were improved introducing Irish Foxhounds.|$|E
5000|$|The Halden {{is similar}} to the <b>American</b> <b>Foxhound</b> in {{appearance}} although it is smaller. Haldens stand between 17 and 21.5 inches at the shoulder, and weigh approximately 40-55 lbs.

They are strong dogs with rectangular bodies and straight, solid backs. The tail is fairly thick, carried low, and hangs down toward the hocks. The skull is slightly domed with a pronounced stop and a straight nosebridge. The cheeks are flat. The ears are pendulous and curled, and the eyes are dark brown and kind. The nose is black. [...] Breeders of Haldens aim for a particular foot shape, with high, tight, long toes and dense fur, for greater stability and warmth as the terrain they hunt through is often snowy and difficult to navigate.|$|E
5000|$|... ==Health== This breed is not {{generally}} a breed that carries genetic disorders. However {{they can easily}} become overweight when overfed. A minor health risk in American Foxhounds is thrombocytopathy, or platelet disease. This comes from poorly functioning blood platelets and can result in excessive bleeding from minor bumps or cuts. The treatment is usually based on {{the severity of the}} disease. Owners will often have their American Foxhounds undergo blood tests so that the condition can be caught early on. While dysplasia was largely unknown in Foxhounds, it is beginning to crop up occasionally, along with some eye issues. It is not typical or customary for Foxhound breeders to screen for any hereditary disorders at this time. The breed's lifespan is generally 10-12 years. The <b>American</b> <b>Foxhound</b> is an energetic breed. According to some veterinarians and trainers, it needs plenty of exercise, for example, a fairly long walk followed by a game of fetch.|$|E

50|$|George Washington, {{our first}} President and the Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, was {{integral}} to the Revolutionary War. While at Mount Vernon, Washington inspected the dog kennels twice a day and visited with his hounds. He was an avid hunter and maintained kennels of foxhounds for this purpose. Though most of his dogs were used for hunting and breeding, he brought along his favorite dog, Sweet Lips, {{with him when he}} went to the First Continental Congress in 1774. During the winter months he went foxhunting a couple times a week. In addition to admiration for some of the dogs he kept for domestic purposes like Sweet Lips, Venus, and True Love, Washington spent a lot of time writing about his rides with his foxhounds. After the War was over, Washington experimented in dog breeding. He sought to create a hunting dog that was fast, smart, and had a sharp nose. After General Marquis de Lafayette sent Washington a few of his favorite French hounds in 1785, Washington began including the French pups in his breeding experiments. The <b>American</b> <b>foxhound,</b> a lighter, faster, smarter, and taller dog than its French or British cousin, sprouted from these experiments, resulting in Washington being known as the “father of the American foxhound”.|$|E

40|$|This PhD {{thesis is}} a {{compendium}} of three publications which sets out to broaden our {{knowledge and understanding of}} the topical application of biological mediators to dental implants, in particular the effects on osseointegration of topical applications of Melatonin or Vitamin D on implants placed in an animal model immediately after dental extraction, determined by histological and histomorphometric analysis. Recent dental research has focused on improving bone substitutes and implant surfaces by morphologic or biochemical modification to achieve faster and better osseointegration. The application of biological mediators over the implant surface or embedded in the biomaterial itself can induce specific cell and tissue responses. Biochemical modifications can improve the both quantity and the quality of peri-implant tissue, which will reduce economic cost and treatment time, and also improve long-term outcomes. Mandibular premolar distal roots (P 2, P 3, P 4) were extracted bilaterally from six <b>American</b> <b>foxhound</b> dogs. Three conical immediate implants were placed bilaterally in each mandible. Three randomized groups were created: melatonin 5 % test group (MI), vitamin D 10 % test group (DI) and control group implants (CI). Block sections were obtained after 12 weeks and processed for mineralized ground sectioning. Bone-to-implant contact (total BIC), new bone formation (NBF), inter-thread bone (ITB) and histological linear measurements (HLM) were assessed. The present trial demonstrated that bone formation around immediate dental implants treated with melatonin and vitamin D improved in comparison with untreated control implants. Implants treated with Vitamin D and Melatonin showed higher bone-to-implant contact values and more new bone formation compared with control implants. Vitamin D treated implants exhibited lower buccal crestal bone loss values compared with control implants. On the other hand, melatonin implants showed less lingual crestal bone loss, and less peri-implant mucosa on the lingual aspect, and exhibited better values for osseointegration compared with control implants. Within the limitations of this animal study, the topical application of 5 % melatonin or 10 % vitamin D improved bone formation around implants placed immediately after extraction and helped to reduce crestal bone loss after 12 weeks osseointegration...|$|E
