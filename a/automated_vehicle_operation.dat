40|$|AbstractDifferent {{components}} of <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{are being made}} available commercially as we speak. Much {{research has been conducted}} into these components and many of these have been studied with respect to their effects on safety, but the transition period from non-automated driving to fully <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> raises safety related issues dealing with mixed traffic situations. More in-depth knowledge should be gained in (the safety of) the behaviour of drivers of unequipped <b>vehicles,</b> enabling <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> to predict and adequately respond to potentially unsafe behaviour, a concept we call backwards compatibility. Also, <b>automated</b> <b>vehicle</b> system design tends to be from an optimal system performance perspective which leads to driving patterns such as driving in the centre of a lane. Other (human) road users however likely exhibit driving behaviour in line with different rationales which allow for suboptimal driving patterns. As of yet, it remains unclear whether these patterns contain indications about the intentions of a driver and if or how other road users anticipate these. This could have two consequences with regard to mixed traffic situations. First of all, other road users might miss important cues from the behaviour of the <b>automated</b> <b>vehicle</b> (what we call forward incompatibility). Secondly, the occupant of an <b>automated</b> <b>vehicle</b> might expect human-like behaviour from the <b>automated</b> <b>vehicle</b> in safety-critical situations, lowering acceptance if this does not meet expectations. The current paper considers these issues and states that we need more insight in how road users use other road users’ behaviour to anticipate safety critical events, especially in the transition period towards fully <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles...</b>|$|R

40|$|Highly <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{have the}} {{potential}} to provide a variety of benefits e. g., decreasing traffic injuries and fatalities by offering people the freedom to choose how to spend their time in their vehicle without jeopardizing the safety of themselves or other traffic participants.

In particular, the proposed algorithm accounts for safety critical zones of miscellaneous shape defined by both the planned longitudinal and lateral motion of the <b>automated</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The <b>automated</b> <b>vehicle</b> is thereby able to efficiently utilize the free road space and traverse dense traffic situation in a self-assertive manner rather than exhibit an excessively conservative behavior.

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> (AVs) is ongoing {{and soon the}} first versions will enter the up to now exclusively human controlled traffic environment. In previous research, we developed an approach for an <b>automated</b> <b>vehicle</b> control in intersection scenarios. The focus was on the decision-making process to either enter the intersection before another car or wait to let the other car pass. While objective risk features were {{used to evaluate the}} performance, the interaction with real human drivers remains uncertain. Therefore, we propose a method to evaluate the <b>automated</b> <b>vehicle</b> behavior from an outside perspective by introducing a human driver and our <b>automated</b> <b>vehicle</b> in the same simulation environment. We conducted a study to examine the interaction and evaluate the <b>automated</b> <b>vehicle</b> behavior from another driver's perspective. The focus of the study was on the naturalness and risk of the behavior and how the subjective risk evaluation is linked to our main objective risk feature. For comparing the results, we used two different setups for our <b>automated</b> <b>vehicle</b> (aggressive vs. passive) and varied the starting position to create either of the two situations (AV first vs. driver first) as mentioned above. The results show a high overall naturalness score. The risk score was related to the outcome of the situation and the AV setup. A weak correlation between the subjective risk assessment and the objective risk feature indicated the necessity to evaluate <b>automated</b> <b>vehicle</b> control from an outside perspective to achieve a better assimilation in human traffic environments. Since the identification of <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> can influence the driver behavior, the integration of a human-like behavior for AVs seems highly desirable...|$|R

This study identified through scenario analysis plausible future development paths of <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the Netherlands and estimated potential implications for traffic, travel behavior and transport planning on a time horizon up to 2030 and 2050. The scenario analysis was performed through a series of three workshops engaging a group of diverse experts. Sixteen key factors and five driving forces behind them were identified as critical in determining future development of <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the Netherlands. Four scenarios were constructed assuming combinations of high or low technological development and restrictive or supportive policies for <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> (AV in standby, AV in bloom, AV in demand, AV in doubt).

40|$|Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) {{offer the}} {{possibility}} of helping drivers to fulfill their driving tasks. <b>Automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> are capable of communicating with surrounding vehicles (V 2 V) and infrastructure (V 2 I) in order to collect and provide essential information about driving environment. Studies have proved that <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> have a potential to decrease traffic congestion on road networks by reducing the time headway, enhancing the traffic capacity and improving the safety margins in car following. Furthermore, vehicle movement and driver 9 ̆ 2 s behavior of conventional vehicles {{will be affected by}} the presence of <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> in traffic networks. Despite different encouraging factors, automated driving raises some concerns such as possible loss of situation awareness, overreliance on automation and degrading driving skills in absence of practice. Moreover, coping with complex scenarios, such as merging at ramps and overtaking, in terms of interaction between <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> and conventional vehicles need more research. This thesis work aims to investigate the effects of <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> on driver 9 ̆ 2 s behavior and traffic performance. A broad literature review in the area of driving simulators and psychological studies was performed to examine the <b>automated</b> <b>vehicle</b> effects on driver 9 ̆ 2 s behavior. Findings from the literature survey, which has been served as setup values in the simulation study of the current work, reveal that the conventional vehicles, which are driving close to the platoon of <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> with short time headway, tend to reduce their time headway and spend more time under their critical time headway. Additionally, driving highly <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> is tedious in a long run, reduce situation awareness and can intensify driver drowsiness, exclusively in light traffic.

40|$|<b>Automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> are {{gradually}} entering our roadway system. Before our roads will be solely used by fully <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles,</b> a long transition period {{is to be}} expected in which fully <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles,</b> partly <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> and manually-driven vehicles have to share our roads. The current report looked into the position of pedestrians and cyclists in such a future traffic system. The report provides an overview of current knowledge, theoretically and empirically, about the interaction of pedestrians and cyclists with (partly) <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Furthermore, it identifies what we need to know {{in order to ensure that}} an automated driving system, particularly during the transition period, does not compromise the safety of pedestrians and cyclists. So far, it can be concluded that <b>automated</b> <b>vehicle</b> technology has mainly focused on the detection and recognition of pedestrians and cyclists by the vehicle and even though good progress has been made, many difficulties are yet to be overcome (e. g., reliable operation in adverse weather conditions). Technology to reliably predict intentions and behaviour of pedestrians and cyclists, so that the <b>automated</b> <b>vehicle</b> can accurately adjust its behaviour is an area that is also crucial for safe interactions between <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> and pedestrians/cyclists. However, this is by no means straightforward because it appears very difficult to predict behavioural intentions of pedestrians and cyclists by current technology. In addition, it cannot be excluded that pedestrians and cyclists will respond differently to (partly) <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> than to manually-driven vehicles. However, the decision making and behaviour of pedestrians and cyclists in interaction with (partly) automated cars have received very little attention in the research community. Aspects known to determine current interactions, such as formal rules and regulations, informal rules and non-verbal communication, expectations, and behavioural adaptation are likely to play a different role in a system with <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> or in a system with a combination of (partly) <b>automated</b> and manually-driven <b>vehicles.</b> If decisions and behaviour of pedestrians and cyclists towards (partly) <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> are found to be different from their behaviour towards a vehicle driven by a human driver, the software developers cannot base their algorithms on what is known about current interactions and behaviour patterns. The few studies that did examine the behaviour of pedestrians and cyclists in their interaction with <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles,</b> generally found that they were fairly cautious when interacting with an <b>automated</b> <b>vehicle</b> and not per definition confident of its 'skills'. Furthermore, pedestrians and cyclists were found to appreciate messages and/or signals from the car indicating whether the car has detected them and what it intends to do. However, which exact messages need to be brought about and the method of communicating them are not yet settled and this requires further study. These and many other questions need to be answered in order to ensure that further developments towards automated driving will not result in a traffic system that is (even) less safe for pedestrians and cyclists than it is presently. Questions, identified in the current report relate, for example, to decision making and behaviour of pedestrians and cyclists when interacting with automated vehicles; the effect of a system with a combination of <b>automated</b> and non-automated <b>vehicles</b> on their behaviour and the options for optimizing the interactions, for example, through training, infrastructure or regulations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—An {{approach}} for formally verifying {{the safety of}} <b>automated</b> <b>vehicles</b> is proposed. Due to the uniqueness of each traffic situation, we verify safety online, i. e., during the <b>operation</b> of the <b>vehicle.</b> The verification is performed by predicting the set of all possible occupancies of the <b>automated</b> <b>vehicle</b> and other traffic participants on the road. In order to capture all possible future scenarios, we apply reachability analysis to consider all possible behaviors of mathematical models considering uncertain inputs (e. g. sensor noise, disturbances) and partially unknown initial states.
