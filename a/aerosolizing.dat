50|$|Thermite's main {{ingredients}} {{were also}} utilized for their individual qualities, specifically reflectivity and heat insulation, in a paint coating or dope for the German zeppelin Hindenburg, possibly contributing to its fiery destruction. This was a theory {{put forward by}} the former NASA scientist Addison Bain, and later tested in small scale by the scientific reality-TV show MythBusters with semi-inconclusive results (it was proven {{not to be the}} fault of the thermite reaction alone, but instead conjectured to be a combination of that and the burning of hydrogen gas that filled the body of the Hindenburg). The MythBusters program also tested the veracity of a video found on the Internet, whereby a quantity of thermite in a metal bucket was ignited while sitting atop several blocks of ice, causing a sudden explosion. They were able to confirm the results, finding huge chunks of ice as far as 50m from the point of explosion. Co-host Jamie Hyneman conjectured that this was due to the thermite mixture <b>aerosolizing,</b> perhaps in a cloud of steam, causing it to burn even faster. Hyneman also voiced skepticism about another theory explaining the phenomenon: that the reaction somehow separated the hydrogen and oxygen in the ice and then ignited them. This explanation claims that the explosion is due to the reaction of high temperature molten aluminium with water. Aluminium reacts violently with water or steam at high temperatures, releasing hydrogen and oxidizing in the process. The speed of that reaction and the ignition of the resulting hydrogen can easily account for the explosion verified. This process is akin to the explosive reaction caused by dropping metallic potassium into water.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Surfactant {{replacement}} therapy is a recognized treatment for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in the newborns. Over the past 30 years, {{human and animal}} trials have been performed regarding administration of <b>aerosolized</b> surfactant to the injured lung, however {{the result has been}} unsatisfactory when compared with instilled surfactant delivery via endotracheal tube (ETT). This review aims to investigate the current issues, challenges and future recommendation of <b>aerosolized</b> surfactant therapy. CONTENT: Five randomized clinical trials in humans and 13 animal trials met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Most animal trials agree that this method of treatment is feasible. However, human trials presented conflicting results, and generally showed it to be ineffective. When compared with surfactant delivery via ETT, <b>aerosolized</b> surfactant is less effective in improving respiratory function. SUMMARY: The current data from human trials does not support the implementation of <b>aerosolized</b> surfactant therapy to treat newborns with RDS.

We conducted a systematic review up to May 2006 to examine the immunogenicity and safety of <b>aerosolized</b> measles vaccine (Edmonston-Zagreb or Schwarz strains) 1 month or more after vaccination. Where possible we estimated pooled serological response rates and odds ratios (with 95 % confidence intervals, CI) comparing <b>aerosolized</b> and subcutaneous vaccines in children in three age groups and adults. We included seven randomized trials, four non-randomized trials and six uncontrolled studies providing serological outcome data on 2887 individuals. In children below 10 months, the studies were heterogeneous. In four comparative studies, seroconversion rates were lower with <b>aerosolized</b> than with subcutaneous vaccine and in two of these the difference was unlikely to be due to chance. In children 10 - 36 months, the pooled seroconversion rate with <b>aerosolized</b> vaccine was 93. 5 % (89. 4 - 97. 7 %) and 97. 1 % (92. 4 - 100 %) with subcutaneous vaccine (odds ratio 0. 27, 0. 04 - 1. 62). In 5 - 15 -year olds the studies were heterogeneous. In all comparative studies <b>aerosolized</b> vaccine was more immunogenic than subcutaneous.

Because the nephrotoxicity of cidofovir {{is a major concern}} in therapy, delivering the drug directly to the respiratory tract might be an effective prophylactic strategy that maximizes the tissue concentration at the site of initial viral replication, while minimizing its accumulation in the kidneys. In the present study, we found that treating mice with <b>aerosolized</b> 14 C-labeled cidofovir (14 C-cidofovir) resulted in the prolonged retention of radiolabeled drug in the lungs at levels greatly exceeding those in the kidneys.

A method adopting this approach was tested in an air-conditioned hospital ward. Artificial coughs were produced by <b>aerosolizing</b> a simulated respiratory fluid containing a known concentration of benign bacteriophage. The bacteriophage exposures estimated {{on the basis of}} the spatial aerosol distributions and its viability function were in reasonable agreement with those measured directly by biological air sampling and culturing.

In contrast, exposures were constant or even increased with distance in the case of lateral coughing. The possibility of incorporating the proposed exposure estimation into a dose-response model for infection risk assessment was discussed.
