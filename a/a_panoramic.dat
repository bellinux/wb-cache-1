5|$|In <b>a</b> <b>panoramic</b> camera, the {{focal-plane shutter}} was {{replaced}} by a rotation of 180° of the lens itself. This model was the basis for the Doppel-Sport Panoramic Camera, which Neubronner tried to market around 1910. It captured <b>a</b> <b>panoramic</b> view on 3cm×8cm film. It never went into serial production, though.|$|E

50|$|The {{memorial}} monument, Patuxai, began {{construction in}} 1957 and completed in 1968, {{is perhaps the}} most prominent landmark in the city. While the Arc de Triomphe in Paris inspired the architecture, the design incorporates typical Lao motifs including “Kinnari”, a mythical bird woman. Energetic visitors can climb {{to the top of the}} monument, which reveals <b>an</b> <b>panoramic</b> view of the city.|$|R

5|$|Haifa {{is home to}} two internationally {{acclaimed}} {{universities and}} several colleges The University of Haifa, founded in 1963, {{is at the top}} of Mt. Carmel. The campus was designed by the architect of Brasília and United Nations Headquarters in New York City, Oscar Niemeyer. The top floor of the 30-story Eshkol Tower provides <b>a</b> <b>panoramic</b> view of northern Israel. The Hecht Museum, with important archeology and art collections, is on the campus of Haifa University.|$|E
5|$|The work {{purchased}} by the Luxembourg in 1925 was In Australia, a portrait of Ned Wright, manager of the property at Delegate where she had stayed in the early 1920s. He is portrayed on horseback, a pipe clasped in his exposed and bright teeth, with <b>a</b> <b>panoramic</b> backdrop of an Australian pastoral landscape. His stance is casual, self-assured and heroic, consistent with the up-beat nationalism of Australia at the time.|$|E
5|$|General Tuan Shi-wen died in 1980, and {{was buried}} in a pagoda-like tomb on a hilltop reached via a 300-metre (984ft) climb. From the top, there is <b>a</b> <b>panoramic</b> view of the village. There is also a {{memorial}} to the KMT soldiers who died in their fight against communism, The Martyrs' Memorial, a museum whose wooden panels bear {{the names of the}} dead, set on an altar in the main building. It was constructed in the style of a large Chinese shrine like the National Revolutionary Martyrs' Shrine in Taipei. The museum also features exhibits describing the struggles of the KMT soldiers and the development of the Doi Mae Salong valley.|$|E

5|$|In 1880, Atlanta {{ranked among}} the fifty largest cities in the United States. The {{battlefield}} is now urban, residential, and commercial land, with many markers memorializing notable events of the battle, including McPherson's place of death. The marker was erected in 1956 by the Georgia Historical Commission. To commemorate the 140th anniversary of the battle, in 2004, two new markers were erected in the Inman Park neighborhood. The Atlanta Cyclorama building, built in 1921 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is a museum located in Grant Park containing <b>a</b> <b>panoramic</b> painting of the battle.|$|E
5|$|The Helix has {{traditionally}} been known for offering <b>a</b> <b>panoramic</b> view of the New York skyline. While local zoning laws prohibit the construction of high-rise buildings that would obstruct sight-lines from higher points in town, as of June 2013 {{construction of a new}} residential building partially blocked the view from the lower portion of the roadway. As of 2015, the Helix is considered by the PANYNJ to have a working life-span of ten years. Alternatives to its replacement include tunnels under the Palisades directly to the Lincoln Tunnel portals.|$|E
5|$|The grandest apartment, which {{belonged to}} Horodecki, {{consisted}} of a study, a great room and a living room, a dining room, a boudoir, a bedroom, a children's room, a room for a governess, a guest room, three rooms for servants, a kitchen, dishwashing room, bathroom, two toilets, and two storage rooms. On the floor above was an apartment similar in size and design to Horodecki's apartment. The apartment {{on the top floor}} had one less room; to make up for this, there was a connecting terrace which provided <b>a</b> <b>panoramic</b> view of the city.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} ways {{of using}} <b>a</b> single <b>panoramic</b> image (captured by a rotating sensor-line camera having very-high spatial resolution) for the geometric shape recovery of a shown object. The {{objective is to}} create a sparse polyhedral model, only allowing a few interactive user inputs for <b>a</b> given single <b>panoramic</b> image. The study was motivated by the general question whether <b>a</b> single <b>panoramic</b> image projection allows some kind of 3 D shape recovery, possibly benefitting from available monocular approaches for standard (say, pinhole-type) camera models. Key words: monocular 3 D reconstruction, cylindrical projection, panorama, rotating sensor-line camera...|$|R

5|$|The {{paintings}} show {{a famous}} incident {{from the life}} of Saint Francis of Assisi, who is shown kneeling by a rock as he receives the stigmata of the crucified Christ on the palms of his hands and soles of his feet. Behind him are rock formations, shown in great detail, and <b>a</b> <b>panoramic</b> landscape that seems to relegate the figures to secondary importance. This treatment of Francis is the first such to appear in northern Renaissance art. The arguments attributing the works to van Eyck are circumstantial and based mainly on the style and quality of the panels. A later, third version is in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, but is weaker and strays significantly in tone and design.|$|E
5|$|Two near-contemporary copies, usually {{attributed}} to the Ghent Master of 1499 and Jan Gossaert, were completed while the original was {{in the collection of}} Margaret of Austria, great-granddaughter of Philip the Good. Both present variants of the Madonna panel as the left wing of a devotional diptych, with a donor portrait as the right wing. However, the two donor panels have very different settings. The 1499 version shows the Cistercian abbot Christiaan de Hondt praying in his luxurious quarters, while Gossaert presents the donor Antonio Siciliano, accompanied by Saint Anthony, in <b>a</b> <b>panoramic</b> landscape setting. It is not known if either work is based on an original left-hand panel painted by van Eyck.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} also {{close to the}} {{original}} entrance gate to Sloatsburg's Cappamore Farm. The house in the nearby mountainside was built around 1900 as an estate for Nicholas T. Brown, a local alderman from Paterson, New Jersey. This estate and farm gave <b>a</b> <b>panoramic</b> view of the countryside around Sloatsburg. The house was demolished during {{the construction of the}} New York State Thruway in 1956. The steel bridge over the Ramapo River and the wooden bridge over Sloat's Millrace were removed as they had become hazardous. Today, all that remains are the stone pillar entranceway, and a walking trail to the nearby Sloat's Dam. The gateposts are listed on the National Register of Historic Places along with the remaining mill and dam structures since they used the same stonework.|$|E

5|$|To create 2,000 Hun {{soldiers}} {{during the}} Huns' attack sequence, the production team developed crowd simulation software called Attila. This software allows thousands of unique characters to move autonomously. A {{variant of the}} program called Dynasty {{was used in the}} final battle sequence to create a crowd of 3,000 in the Forbidden City. Pixar's photorealistic open API RenderMan was used to render the crowd. Another software developed for this movie was Faux Plane, which was used to add depth to flat two-dimensional painting. Although developed late in production progress, Faux Plane was used in five shots, including the dramatic sequence which features the Great Wall of China, and the final battle sequence when Mulan runs to the Forbidden City. During the scene in which the Chinese are bowing to Mulan, the crowd is <b>a</b> <b>panoramic</b> film of real people bowing. It was edited into the animated foreground of the scene.|$|E
