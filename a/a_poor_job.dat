When the episode's editor first received one take of the scene in which Veronica and Mac sarcastically dance in response to accusations of doing <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> <b>job</b> on a school project, the editor called the writing staff into the editing room; they proceeded to view the scene fifteen times because of its humorous nature. They immediately included the take in the final cut of the episode.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) orders Darryl to hire {{replacements}} for the warehouse staff, but Darryl is wallowing in his depression and neglects to {{even look at}} the applications. With an order due out for one of Phyllis Vance's (Phyllis Smith) most important clients, Andy asks for volunteers to step in {{for the day and}} make sure that the order is shipped out. Jim, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) take over the process, (however, in a talking-head interview, Kevin states that he will deliberately do <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> <b>job</b> because he did not volunteer and was merely suggested for the job because of his large size), but {{do not know how to}} use the heavy-lifting equipment and balk at the notion of carrying all the heavy boxes by hand. Upon Kevin's suggestion, they create an oil luge to slide the boxes across the floor resulting in a lot of damaged inventory. They retool Kevin's idea throughout the day, resulting in still more damaged inventory, and Phyllis ultimately loses the client.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} to {{what extent}} children of convicted parents might have {{a higher risk of}} a conviction themselves because criminal justice systems, such as the police and courts, focus more attention towards certain criminal families - a concept called official bias. Bias was measured using several variables: a convicted parent, low family income, low family socio-economic status, <b>poor</b> housing and <b>a</b> father's <b>poor</b> <b>job</b> record. <b>A</b> convicted parent as well as poorer social circumstances such as <b>a</b> father's <b>poor</b> <b>job</b> record, low family income and <b>poor</b> housing predicted <b>an</b> increased conviction risk while controlling for self-reported offending. The results support the official bias mechanism, but also suggest that other mechanisms are needed to explain intergenerational transmission of criminal convictions. © The Author 2013...|$|R

500|$|One {{negative}} {{review was}} written by Margaret McFadden-Gerber in Magill's Literary Annual, who found the book disappointing and felt that it lacked the power and introspection of Angelou's previous books. At least one reviewer expresses disappointment that Angelou did not use her status to effect any political change in Singin' and Swingin'. Critic Lyman B. Hagen responds to this criticism by stating that Angelou's status during the events she describes in this autobiography did not lend itself {{to that kind of}} advocacy, and that as a person, Angelou had not evolved into the advocate that she would become later in her life. Reviewer John McWhorter finds many of the events Angelou describes throughout all of her autobiographies incoherent and confusing, and in need of further explanation as to her motives and reasons for her behavior. For example, McWhorter suggests that Angelou does <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> <b>job</b> of explaining her reasons for her marriage to Tosh Angelos, as well as their divorce. [...] "In an autobiography in which a black woman marries outside of her race in the 1950s, we need to know more".|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} feature by which players could [...] "rewind" [...] time and {{reattempt}} difficult sections of ZX Spectrum and Nintendo Entertainment System games, which were {{known for their}} difficulty, especially in the notoriously challenging Battletoads. Kotaku figured that Rare added cheats to make the esoteric and [...] "crushingly tough" [...] Spectrum games tolerable, and the Ars Technica review wished that this [...] "rewind" [...] feature had been extended to the Nintendo 64 titles. Critics liked the Snapshot challenges and Polygon {{reported that they were}} crucial for learning basic game mechanics, though less accessible than those of NES Remix. Reviewers complained that the Spectrum game controls were difficult to decipher. The Ars Technica reviewer thought that the compilation did <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> <b>job</b> of explaining each game's controls, and wondered why Rare did not include introductory or how-to videos. Instead, he turned to YouTube videos and external FAQs before playing each game. Eurogamer and Ars Technica disagreed on the virtues of having the Spectrum emulator replicate the graphical glitches of the original console. Jaz Rignall of USgamer appreciated the added option to save game progress at any time for the Spectrum classics, and wrote that the collection will remind players how difficult games used to be.|$|E

Dwight reads her file and learns Kelly spent time in juvenile hall, but is disappointed to learn it does not affect her job performance. Meanwhile, Andy (Ed Helms) finds himself attracted to Julia, a female potential client who is talking with Stanley (Leslie David Baker). Andy repeatedly acts awkwardly in front of Julia, and accidentally sets off her car alarm while trying to look inside and find out what music she likes. Andy admits his attraction to her to Stanley, who then gives the potential client over to Andy in exchange for two of his clients. [...] After walking her out to the car, Andy tries to kiss her, but is immediately rebuked. Andy apologizes and mentions that he just got out of a relationship.

500|$|Lowell's {{earliest}} poems {{were published}} without remuneration in the Southern Literary Messenger in 1840. He {{was inspired to}} new efforts towards self-support and joined with his friend Robert Carter in founding the literary journal The Pioneer. The periodical was distinguished {{by the fact that}} most of its content was new rather than material that had been previously published elsewhere, and by the inclusion of very serious criticism, which covered not only literature but also art and music. Lowell wrote that it would [...] "furnish the intelligent and reflecting portion of the Reading Public with a rational substitute for the enormous quantity of thrice-diluted trash, in the shape of namby-pamby love tales and sketches, which is monthly poured out to them by many of our popular Magazines." [...] William Wetmore Story noted the journal's higher taste, writing that [...] "it took some stand & appealled to a higher intellectual Standard than our [...] milk or watery namby-pamby Mags with which we are overrun". The first issue of the journal included the first appearance of [...] "The Tell-Tale Heart" [...] by Edgar Allan Poe. Lowell was treated for an eye disease in New York shortly after the first issue, and in his absence Carter did <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> <b>job</b> of managing the journal. The magazine ceased publication after three monthly numbers beginning in January 1843, leaving Lowell $1,800 in debt. Poe mourned the journal's demise, calling it [...] "a most severe blow to the cause—the cause of a Pure Taste".|$|E
2500|$|The departures of {{the stars}} from the 1980s exposed serious {{deficiencies}} in the Oilers' development system.

This didn't become apparent for a few years; as mentioned above, the Oilers still had enough heft to make the conference finals two years in a row. However, it was obvious that they were nowhere near being the powerhouse that had dominated the league in the previous half-decade. In 1992–93, the Oilers missed the playoffs {{for the first time as}} an NHL team.
