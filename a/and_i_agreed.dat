I guess they'd have to have upward-reaching branches, too, for the line about 'lifting leafy arms to pray.' Rule out weeping willows.|$|E
500|$|In {{his rookie}} year, Doby hit 5-for-32 in 29 games. He played four games {{at second base}} and one each at first base and shortstop. Throughout the season he talked with Robinson via telephone, the two {{encouraging}} each other. [...] "And Jackie <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> we shouldn't challenge anybody or cause trouble—or we'd both {{be out of the}} big leagues, just like that. We figured that if we spoke out, we would ruin things for other black players." [...] After his rookie season, Doby again pursued time on the basketball court and appeared with the Paterson Crescents of the American Basketball League after signing a contract in January 1948. He was the first black player to join the league.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the book}} were positive, with Nolan Howell of Canoe.com {{describing}} it as a [...] "straightforward look {{into the life of}} a man that has dedicated himself to the sport of professional wrestling" [...] and has [...] "an endearing, personal style that gives an apt representation of the author...For fans such as myself who appreciated the blunt style of the man known as Hardcore Holly, this ECW Press product will be an entertaining, worthwhile look into one of the unique personalities of professional wrestling." [...] Joe Babinsack, writing for the Wrestling Observer, described the book as [...] "brutal, boisterous and definitely worth reading". Bruce Mitchell, writing for the Pro Wrestling Torch, described the book as [...] "hard-hitting, straightforward, and not very fancy", rating it [...] "one of the strongest professional wrestling books in a long while". Dave Meltzer, editor of the Wrestling Observer wrote, [...] "in a lot of books, you think you're reading what the person writing feels {{is the right thing to}} say for their career... With Holly, whether you agree or not (<b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> with some of his stuff, not others), I had no doubt he was giving his true opinions on things. In that sense, it was a very honest look at a period of WWF history from a guy who had ups and downs... but survived a long time." ...|$|E

500|$|With Imaginos again {{a work in}} {{progress}} at the end of 1986, band manager Steve Schenk contacted Albert Bouchard to get the original recordings he still owned. Pearlman, with the help of engineers Paul Mandl and Steve Brown, spent his time cleaning up, re-arranging and remixing the original recordings, using state-of-the-art technology and the collaborations of studio musicians. Virtuoso guitarist Joe Satriani financed the recording of his second album, Surfing with the Alien, through his work on Imaginos. Similarly, thrash metal guitarist Marc Biedermann, whose band Blind Illusion was recording at Hyde Street Studios, mixed the album The Sane Asylum at Pearlman's studio in exchange for his collaboration. Biedermann declared in a 2008 interview that he [...] "played more lead guitar on that album than Buck Dharma". Roeser went to California in early 1987 to record his lead vocals and some guitar parts, while Tommy Zvoncheck, still a member of Blue Öyster Cult, re-recorded most of the keyboards on the album. The last parts recorded were the lead vocals by Eric Bloom, who was in the studio in early 1988. Donald Roeser later summed up his and Bloom's late involvement in the making of the album by saying [...] "Imaginos was our parting of the ways. That was something that Eric <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> to do, sort of, out of respect for Sandy and his effort that he made with Imaginos".|$|E

2500|$|Unable to come {{to terms}} with the Rangers, Shanahan sat out the first half of the 2008–09 season. Then, on January 10, 2009, it was {{announced}} that Shanahan agreed to join the New Jersey Devils for his second stint with the team. Four days later, on January 14, the terms of the contract were finalized and Shanahan signed a one-year, $800,000 prorated contract. The time between Shanahan's departure from and return to the Devils was 17 years, 294 days, the longest gap in tenure with one team in NHL history. Playing in his first game back with the Devils since 1990–91, he scored the first goal of the game against the Nashville Predators on a 5-on-3 power play by toe dragging the puck around the opposition player and then shooting it on the pad side on January 19 in a 3–1 win. On August 5, 2009, Shanahan agreed to a one-year deal with the Devils returning for a 22nd season, to play during the 2009–10 season. This would have been Shanahan's sixth season as a Devil. However, on October 1, 2009, the Devils and Shanahan parted ways, with Shanahan saying, [...] "When I signed this past summer, Lou Lamoriello, Jacques Lemaire <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> that if we were unable to find a suitable fit in which I would be able to compete and contribute at the level I expect from myself, then I would simply step aside." [...] Shanahan had played just four pre-season games of the 2009–10 season. He scored the Devils' last pre-season goal that year, on one of his last NHL shifts.|$|E
2500|$|He {{explained}} his particular ethos {{and style of}} management of CSIRO in this way: Well, I suppose I always wanted to extrapolate from my own experience, small-scale experience, and some personal opinions. I had a strong desire always to see pure and applied research undertaken {{side by side in}} the same laboratory.... And I was still very much aware that the recognition that many – most, I should say – of the really important and fundamental discoveries in science which subsequently led to a massive technological development have come through curiosity-led research, and often through serendipity, which is terribly important. I think the Birch report was very helpful, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> with his report that the whole core of the policy-making in the science that we were going to carry out was a matter of defining the right proportion of, shall we say, pure research, strategic mission-oriented, and technical research – and getting that proportion right.... I felt that fundamental research in the end was going to reap the real benefits in the long run ... discovering something like electricity ... was absolutely fundamental research and had an enormous impact on the world. On the other hand, there was the awareness that you're in charge of an organisation that's spending a million dollars of taxpayers' money every day, and that's a very sobering thought, so you had to keep the reins on as well. Indeed, there were many frustrations in being CSIRO's Chairman at that time, of which he nominated as the worst [...] "the frustration of finding it so difficult to bring in new young blood because of the descending budget in real terms." ...|$|E
