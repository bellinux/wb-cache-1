5|$|The Battle of Posada was <b>a</b> <b>turning</b> {{point in}} Hungarian-Wallachian relations: {{though in the}} course of the 14th century, the kings of Hungary still tried to {{regulate}} the voivodes of Wallachia more than one time, but they could only succeed temporarily.

Midway allowed this to occur before the first of the new Essex-class fleet carriers became available at the end of 1942.
