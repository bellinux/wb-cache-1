50|$|NCO also {{represents}} {{the quantity of}} country <b>A's</b> <b>currency</b> available on the foreign exchange market, and as such {{can be viewed as}} the supply-half that determines the real exchange rate, the demand-half being demand for <b>A's</b> <b>currency</b> in the foreign exchange market. As {{can be seen in the}} graph, NCO serves as the perfectly inelastic supply curve for this market. Thus, changes in the demand for <b>A's</b> <b>currency</b> (e.g. change from an increase in foreign demand for products made in country A) only cause changes in the exchange rate and not in the net amount of <b>A's</b> <b>currency</b> available for exchange.|$|R

5|$|While {{some of the}} {{conditions}} to allow <b>a</b> <b>currency</b> war were in place at various points throughout this period, countries generally had contrasting priorities and at no point were there enough states simultaneously wanting to devalue for <b>a</b> <b>currency</b> war to break out. On several occasions countries were desperately attempting not to cause a devaluation but to prevent one. So states were striving not against other countries but against market forces that were exerting undesirable downwards pressure on their currencies. Examples include The United Kingdom during Black Wednesday and various tiger economies during the Asian crises of 1997. During the mid-1980s the United States did desire to devalue significantly, but were able to secure the cooperation of other major economies with the Plaza Accord. As free market influences approached their zenith during the 1990s, advanced economies and increasingly transition and even emerging economies moved {{to the view that}} it was best to leave the running of their economies to the markets and not to intervene even to correct a substantial current account deficit.|$|E

5|$|Argentina {{abandoned}} {{the gold standard}} in December 1929, earlier than most countries. For much of the previous period, the country had operated <b>a</b> <b>currency</b> board, in which a body known as the caja de conversión was charged with maintaining the peso's value in gold. The devaluation of the peso increased the competitiveness of its exports and protected domestic production. Argentina saw {{the value of its}} exports drop from $1,537 million in 1929 to $561 million in 1932, but this was by no means the most severe downturn in the region.|$|E
5|$|By 2009 {{some of the}} {{conditions}} required for <b>a</b> <b>currency</b> war had returned, with a severe economic downturn seeing global trade in that year decline by about 12%. There was a widespread concern among advanced economies {{about the size of}} their deficits; they increasingly joined emerging economies in viewing export led growth as their ideal strategy. In March 2009, even before international co-operation reached its peak with the 2009 G-20 London Summit , economist Ted Truman {{became one of the first}} to warn of the dangers of competitive devaluation. He also coined the phrase competitive non-appreciation.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{competitive}} devaluations {{have been}} rare as countries have generally preferred {{to maintain a}} high value for their currency. Countries have generally allowed market forces to work, or have participated in systems of managed exchanges rates. An exception occurred when <b>a</b> <b>currency</b> war {{broke out in the}} 1930s when countries abandoned the gold standard during the Great Depression and used currency devaluations in an attempt to stimulate their economies. Since this effectively pushes unemployment overseas, trading partners quickly retaliated with their own devaluations. The period is considered to have been an adverse situation for all concerned, as unpredictable changes in exchange rates reduced overall international trade.|$|E

5000|$|In modern {{monetary}} policy, a devaluation is {{an official}} lowering {{of the value}} of <b>a</b> country's <b>currency</b> within <b>a</b> fixed exchange rate system, by which the monetary authority formally sets a new fixed rate with respect to <b>a</b> foreign reference <b>currency</b> or currency basket. In contrast, a depreciation is a decrease in <b>a</b> <b>currency's</b> value (relative to other major currency benchmarks) due to market forces under a floating exchange rate, not government or central bank policy actions.|$|R
5|$|In 1881, <b>a</b> <b>currency</b> reform {{introduced}} a bimetallic standard, which {{went into effect}} in July 1883. Unlike many precious metal standards the system was very decentralized: no national monetary authority existed and all control over convertibility rested with the five banks of issue. The period of convertibility lasted only 17 months: from December 1884 the banks of issue refused to exchange gold at par for notes. The suspension of convertibility was soon accommodated by the government, since, having no institutional power over the monetary system, there was little they could do to prevent it.|$|E
5|$|In the New World, {{lead was}} {{produced}} {{soon after the}} arrival of European settlers. The earliest recorded lead production dates to 1621 in the English Colony of Virginia, fourteen years after its foundation. In Australia, the first mine opened by colonists on the continent was a lead mine, in 1841. In Africa, lead mining and smelting were known in the Benue Trough and the lower Congo Basin, where lead was used for trade with Europeans, and as <b>a</b> <b>currency</b> by the 17th century, well before the scramble for Africa.|$|E
5|$|Many {{national}} and corporate bonds denominated in euro are significantly more liquid and have {{lower interest rates}} than was historically the case when denominated in national currencies. While increased liquidity may lower the nominal interest rate on the bond, denominating the bond in <b>a</b> <b>currency</b> {{with low levels of}} inflation arguably plays a much larger role. A credible commitment to low levels of inflation and a stable debt reduces the risk that the value of the debt will be eroded by higher levels of inflation or default in the future, allowing debt to be issued at a lower nominal interest rate.|$|E
50|$|By an {{accounting}} identity, Country A's NCO is always equal to A's Net Exports, because {{the value of}} net exports {{is equal to the}} amount of capital spent abroad (i.e. outflow) for goods that are imported in A. It is also equal to the net amount of <b>A's</b> <b>currency</b> traded in the foreign exchange market over that time period. The value of exports (bananas, ice cream, clothing) produced in country A is always matched by the value of reciprocal payments of some asset (cash, stocks, real estate) made by buyers in other countries to the producers in country A. This value is also equal to the total amount of <b>A's</b> <b>currency</b> traded in the foreign exchange market over that year, because essentially the buyers in other countries trade in their assets (e.g. foreign currency) to convert to equivalent amount in <b>A's</b> <b>currency,</b> and use this amount to pay for A's export products.|$|R
40|$|Probably about {{a quarter}} of the world’s foreign {{exchange}} reserves are denominated in euros and the euro appears to have gained importance as <b>a</b> reserve <b>currency</b> in recent years.

5|$|The {{detailed}} {{causes of}} the debt crisis varied. In several countries, private debts arising from a property bubble were transferred to sovereign debt {{as a result of}} banking system bailouts and government responses to slowing economies post-bubble. The structure of the eurozone as <b>a</b> <b>currency</b> union (i.e., one currency) without fiscal union (e.g., different tax and public pension rules) contributed to the crisis and limited the ability of European leaders to respond. European banks own a significant amount of sovereign debt, such that concerns regarding the solvency of banking systems or sovereigns are negatively reinforcing.|$|E

5|$|The {{rates were}} {{determined}} by the Council of the European Union, based on a recommendation from the European Commission based on the market rates on 31 December 1998. They were set so that one European Currency Unit (ECU) would equal one euro. The European Currency Unit was an accounting unit used by the EU, based on the currencies of the member states; it was not <b>a</b> <b>currency</b> in its own right. They could not be set earlier, because the ECU depended on the closing exchange rate of the non-euro currencies (principally the pound sterling) that day.|$|E

5|$|As in Red Dead Redemption, {{the player}} can diverge {{from the main}} story on side quests: {{requests}} from strangers, checklist challenges, and other digressions. These missions are similar in format {{to those of the}} original but their objectives are replaced to fit the zombie horror theme. For example, the player hunts for family members instead of fugitives or empties graveyards instead of gang hideouts. Marston is called to liberate towns overrun by the undead, which unlocks ammo, new places to stay, quests, and the assistance of the living townspeople. After Marston's assistance, the towns remain free of zombies for several in-game days, but will eventually require the player's assistance when zombies return once again. The player decides whether to share ammunition with the townsfolk: ammunition serves as <b>a</b> <b>currency</b> in the game since the shops have closed. The player has fewer correctives for immorality, such as helping or killing other survivors, given the dire circumstances. The game puts a greater emphasis on hyperbolic fun.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the case for}} adopting the Australian dollar as <b>a</b> common <b>currency</b> among the island countries in the South Pacific. The proposal of <b>a</b> single <b>currency</b> was informally floated by Australia at the Pacific Forum Leaders Meeting in Auckland, in August 2003. The Pacific Forum consists of 14 developing island countries and the developed countries in the region, namely, Australia and New Zealand. In early 2003, a committee of the Australian Senate recommended adoption of <b>a</b> single <b>currency</b> as <b>a</b> possible remedy to meet the deteriorating economic situations in the Pacific island countries, arising out of poor fiscal discipline and failure to effectively use external aid inflows. Successful adoption of <b>a</b> single <b>currency</b> with either <b>a</b> new <b>currency</b> or <b>an</b> existing <b>currency</b> of <b>a</b> dominant partner in trade and development requires the fulfillment of various prerequirements, which are well known as optimum currency area conditions.

40|$|The paper {{evaluates the}} costs and {{benefits}} of <b>a</b> single <b>currency</b> area within <b>a</b> unified framework. Conven-tionally, it is argued that <b>a</b> single <b>currency</b> area carries <b>a</b> welfare loss owing to the sacrifice of exchange rate adjustment in the presence of country-specific shocks. But in 1973 Mundell argued that <b>a</b> single <b>currency</b> area offers risk-sharing benefits when capital markets are limited in their ability to facilitate consumption insurance. The authors construct a simple model and compare a system of independent national <b>currencies</b> to <b>a</b> single <b>currency</b> area. The presence of country-specific shocks may either reduce or enhance the bene-fits of <b>a</b> single <b>currency</b> area, depending on the importance of exchange rate adjustment relative to risk-sharing. In a simple quantitative analysis, we find that either regime may dominate, although the utility differences between the two regimes are very small. 1...|$|R
40|$|How do {{international}} currencies get {{established and}} consolidated? What {{domestic and international}} political foundations support <b>an</b> international <b>currency?</b> And what kinds of macro-economic flows enable <b>an</b> international <b>currency?</b> In this essay we consider these perennial questions of modern IPE scholarship in reverse order to ask whether the euro could ever have become, or seek to become, <b>a</b> true international <b>currency</b> rivalling the US dollar, used not only for passive foreign exchange reserves but also as <b>a</b> major commercial <b>currency</b> outside the EU. We argue that the EU lacks the will, the ideas {{and the capacity to}} promote the euro into the status of <b>an</b> international <b>currency.</b> In this article, we concentrate on this final issue of capacity, as the will and ideas issues have already been well explored. Capacity is an issue coeval with, if not prior to, the first two issues. The EU's current institutional arrangements and its economic geography create macro-economic consequences that diminish the euro's capacity to operate as <b>a</b> top <b>currency.</b> These conflicts go beyond the well-recognized issue that the euro-zone is not <b>an</b> optimum <b>currency</b> area.
