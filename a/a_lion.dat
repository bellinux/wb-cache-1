5|$|However, if a {{preference}} set is non-convex, then some prices determine a budget-line that supports two separate optimal-baskets. For example, {{we can imagine}} that, for zoos, <b>a</b> <b>lion</b> costs {{as much as an}} eagle, and further that a zoo's budget suffices for one eagle or one lion. We can suppose also that a zoo-keeper views either animal as equally valuable. In this case, the zoo would purchase either one lion or one eagle. Of course, a contemporary zoo-keeper does not want to purchase half of an eagle and half of <b>a</b> <b>lion</b> (or a griffin)! Thus, the zoo-keeper's preferences are non-convex: The zoo-keeper prefers having either animal to having any strictly convex combination of both.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, {{the lion}} too {{has always had}} a close {{association}} with Iranian kingship. The garments and throne decorations of the Achaemenid kings were embroidered with lion motifs.
