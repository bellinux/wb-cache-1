5|$|Atlantis finally docked to Mir's Kristall module {{using the}} docking module's top {{androgynous}} unit on flight day 4. The tension was high aboard Atlantis as Cameron maneuvered the shuttle towards Mir using the orbiter's thrusters. Atlantis docked with Mir at 06:27:38UTC following a faultless set of orbital maneuvers. After all the required checks {{had been completed}} and the hatches had been opened, the five shuttle astronauts moved into Mir, ready to carry out three days of combined operations with Mirs resident crew, Russian cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Avdeyev (carrying out the Mir EO-20 expedition) and ESA astronaut Thomas Reiter (flying on the Euromir 95 expedition). The two crews greeted each other with handshakes <b>and</b> <b>hugs</b> before carrying out a traditional gift exchange, with flowers and chocolates being swapped between the crews.|$|E
5|$|Some {{time later}} Susan finds David, {{who has just}} been jilted by Alice because of her, on a high {{platform}} at his brontosaurus reconstruction at the museum. After showing him the missing bone which she'd found by trailing George for three days, Susan, against his warnings, climbs a tall ladder next to the dinosaur {{to be closer to}} him. She tells David that her Aunt has given her the million dollars, and she wants to donate it to the museum, but David is more interested in telling her that the day spent with her was the best day of his life. Unconsciously swaying the ladder from side to side upon hearing David's further words of endearment and love, Susan tells him that she loves him too, then notices that the ladder {{is on the verge of}} falling over. Frightened, she climbs onto and over the skeleton, but just before the dinosaur bones collapse David grabs her hand, she dangles below him, and he lifts her onto the platform. Regrettably surveying the wreckage of his work, David soon accepts the destruction and chaos, gives in, <b>and</b> <b>hugs</b> and kisses Susan.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift, barefoot and {{clad in a}} white sundress, {{approaching}} a tall, arched doorway which materializes {{in the middle of}} a barren landscape. Swift looks at a photograph of herself and her friend tucked into the arch and, then, passes through the doors. On the other side of the arch, animated flowers and vines grow across the scenes. People and objects from a high school fade in and out of view. Swift walks through the memories and begins to play an acoustic guitar beneath a tree. Afterward, Anderson appears, sitting at a desk before a chalkboard in the field of flowers. Swift sits down beside her and two begin to whisper and laugh to each other. In the next scene, Swift plays a namesake Taylor brand guitar while Anderson goes on her first date; she kisses her date, but pushes him away when he tries to go further. Her love interest and all surroundings dissolve to show Anderson sitting alone on a stone bench. Swift approaches her <b>and</b> <b>hugs</b> her tightly as the field around them turns dark and stormy. The video then alternates between Swift singing in the rain and hugging her friend. After the landscape deteriorates, the video transitions to reality, where Swift, wearing a black trench coat, stands in the rain, across the street from a high school. Swift then sees a student at the entrance; the two make eye contact and the video concludes. To date, the video has over 108 million views on YouTube.|$|E

25|$|The 2005–06 NBA season {{marked a}} {{crossroads}} in Bryant's basketball career. Despite past differences with Bryant, Jackson returned {{to coach the}} Lakers. Bryant endorsed the move, and by all appearances, the two men worked together well the second time around, leading the Lakers back into the playoffs. Bryant's individual scoring accomplishments posted resulted in the finest statistical season of his career. On December 20, 2005, Bryant scored 62 points in three quarters against the Dallas Mavericks. Entering the fourth quarter, Bryant outscored the entire Mavericks team 62–61, the only time a player has done this through three quarters since {{the introduction of the}} shot clock. When the Lakers faced the Miami Heat on January 16, 2006, Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal made headlines by engaging in handshakes <b>and</b> <b>hugs</b> before the game, signifying a change in the feud that had festered between them. A month later, at the 2006 NBA All-Star Game, the two were seen laughing together.|$|E
25|$|Thanks to Ingrid; {{the spell}} of {{shattered}} sight is finally broken, the shards turn into snow and Storybrooke returns to normal, including Regina and Mary Margaret, who immediately stop fighting and start laughing. Mary Margaret and David run up to Emma to hug her, while Henry runs to Regina <b>and</b> <b>hugs</b> both her and Emma. As Neal begins to wake up, David tells Mary Margaret to forget what happened under the curse, then the couple kiss. Finally, Gold checks on Belle as she is sleeping, when Hook arrived to the pawnshop and tells him Henry got away. Gold asks how he failed at kidnapping a child, only to have Hook respond to that answer by saying his heart wasn't in it. Since Gold knows that the Snow Queen’s plan failed, he tells Hook it’s his last day on earth. Hook makes a final request as a dying wish to leave Emma {{and the rest of}} Storybrooke intact. Gold says as long as Emma doesn't get in his way, she’ll survive. He says once he steps over the line with his magic, they have nothing to fear from him – but says he can’t make that promise {{for the rest of the}} world. Confident that he will go through with his plans, a smug but sinister Gold leaves the pawnshop to walk out into the fresh Storybrooke snowy air.|$|E

Marital affection between Ruth and her husband is only represented through brief kisses <b>and</b> <b>hugs.</b> The role ends when Ruth and Paul emigrate to Australia where Paul will teach agriculture, leaving Lassie with neighbor Cully Wilson. Timmy was reclaimed by the County and eventually adopted by a family named McCullough and began using his middle name, Steven.

500|$|Vince Haycock {{directed}} the music video for [...] "Black & Blue" [...] {{on location in}} Hackney, London in August 2009. The clip features The Bill actor Jeff Stewart as a bearded man. The video begins with the man waking up in his apartment at noon. He conducts various experiments to create music, and finally finishes a robotic mannequin that plays the drums. This is interspersed with shots of Miike Snow band members driving a car with Wyatt singing in the backseat.

She staffed a kissing booth at the Dallas convention of the ALA, underneath the banner [...] "Hug a Homosexual," [...] with a [...] "women only" [...] side and a [...] "men only" [...] side. When no one took advantage of it, she and Patience and Sarah author Alma Routsong (pen name: Isabel Miller) kissed in front of rolling television cameras. In describing its success, despite most of the reaction being negative, Gittings said, [...] "We needed to get an audience. So we decided, let's show gay love live. We were offering free—mind you, free—same-sex kisses <b>and</b> <b>hugs.</b> Let me tell you, the aisles were mobbed, but no one came into the booth to get a free hug. So we hugged and kissed each other. It was shown twice on the evening news, once again in the morning. It put us on the map." ...|$|E
500|$|Dennis arrives, {{and he and}} Alyssa {{find their}} way to an {{abandoned}} hospital where they encounter Scissorman and Scissorwoman, who kidnap Dennis. Alyssa is then transported to a castle, where she sees Dick reciting a strange incantation. She learns Dick knew of the Ritual of Engagement, and had discovered that Lord Burroughs, the owner of the castle and from whom he is descended, also knew of the ritual. She then sees an incident from the past of Dick asking for Burroughs' help to become an Entity, inviting Burroughs to enter his body and for them to complete the Ritual together. Burroughs' spirit takes possession of Dick, turning into The Dark Gentleman. Meanwhile, Alyssa is able to rescue Dennis from the twins, killing them in the process. The Dark Gentleman then tells Alyssa if she wants to save Nancy's soul, she must come {{to the top of the}} tower. There, The Dark Gentlemen turns into Lord Burroughs and begins the Ritual. However, Dennis distracts Burroughs, allowing Alyssa to fight back. Nancy's spirit transfers what is left of her own Rooder power into Alyssa, giving her the strength to destroy Burroughs. After she defeats him, she reunites with her mother's spirit. The tower then collapses. Alyssa awakens in a field, where she sees Dennis.

500|$|The {{music video}} opens with Williams waking up {{on a couch}} next to an unnamed {{sleeping}} male and writes a note that says [...] "I'm sorry". From there she walks to a room <b>and</b> <b>hugs</b> her father, who's mentioned in song. A conversation ensues with Williams taking a photo of someone presumed to be her mother. The video continues with Williams in her room staring at the photo on a mirror, singing about how love, [...] "does not exist." [...] She moves through a costume closet and into a restaurant set, where a rotating cast of men pose as her date. Then into the next room, there's a wedding — everyone is wearing white (the other band members in attendance), but Williams comes dressed in black; she flees the scene from where the bride enters. During the chorus of the song, the clip cuts to the scenes where Williams is lying down on a giant pile of Valentine-themed cards. Throughout the video, clips of Williams singing {{with the rest of}} Paramore in a dim-lighted background are shown. In the video's final moments, Williams spots the same male she woke up to {{at the beginning of the}} video in the crowd at a rock show. After fantasizing of the two being together through all sets from the start of the video, she makes her way back through the various rooms to the original set in the beginning. When Williams sings [...] "And I'm on my way to believing", she returns to the couch where the male is still asleep, and hides the note she wrote in her pocket as she lies back down next to him.|$|E

500|$|Jay-Z was due {{to perform}} [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] with Keys during the opening game of the {{baseball}} 2009 World Series in early October 2009 but, due to an inclement weather, the duo did not perform. They ultimately performed the song live in the Yankee Stadium before Game 2 of the 2009 World Series in mid-October. The two musicians performed the song on a custom-made stage adorned with Yankees flags, while images of New York City flashed across several large screens throughout the stadium. Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News wrote of the performance, [...] "If the Yankees were looking to change their tune heading into Game 2 of the World Series, they couldn't have picked better musical guests." [...] During most live performances of the track, the lyrics containing profanity {{are included in the}} song, but they were omitted for the World Series set. On November 5, 2009, Jay-Z and Keys sang [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] at the MTV Europe Music Awards (EMA) in Berlin, Germany, while performing in front of a New York cityscape. Jocelyn Vena and Eric Ditzian of MTV News noted that Jay-Z [...] "took his hometown pride rather seriously" [...] during the performance. Jay-Z also performed the song at the Yankees' World Series victory ceremonies in New York City Hall on November 6, 2009. Keys was not in attendance for the performance, so singer and Roc Nation recording artist Bridget Kelly filled in. As the last verse of the song was sung, Yankee members got up from their seats to shower Jay-Z with handshakes <b>and</b> <b>hugs.</b>|$|E
500|$|Ringo and Donna later {{get back}} {{together}} and {{to prove that he}} loves her, Ringo proposes. In June 2010, it was revealed that the 6000th episode celebrations would see the wedding of Donna and Ringo. News.com reported that producers hoped that the wedding would [...] "recreate the magic" [...] of Scott Robinson (Jason Donovan) and Charlene Mitchell's (Kylie Minogue) 1987 wedding. Robbie said she had [...] "big shoes to fill", but she was honoured to be working on her biggest storyline since she arrived. Clark said that Donna and Ringo had made the decision {{that they are going to}} be with each other for life and that they are [...] "going to be solid from now on". On the wedding day, Donna's car breaks down and she is forced to ride in the back of Lucas Fitzgerald's (Scott Major) truck. Donna walks down the aisle to Ringo's version of [...] "Suddenly", the original song played at Scott and Charlene's wedding. Clark added [...] "It's a perfect day, but I can't promise they'll live happily ever after." [...] Donna and Ringo became the 36th couple to get married on the show. A month later, Ringo is knocked down by Stephanie Scully's (Carla Bonner) motorcycle and he dies. Donna is devastated and she stays in her room. Steph comes to visit her and as she is apologising, Donna gets up <b>and</b> <b>hugs</b> her.

500|$|The {{performance}} sparked criticisms {{from some}} parents {{on social media}} who believed the performance was [...] "provocative" [...] and [...] "inappropriate" [...] due to its risqué nature; Melissa Henson, {{a representative of the}} Parents Television Council {{said in a statement that}} the performance was [...] "suggestive" [...] before adding, [...] "We have seen pretty consistently enough inappropriate material , that a lot of parents have written these off." [...] Contrastingly, writing for ThinkProgress, Alyssa Rosenberg said of the controversy: [...] "This may not be the vision of marriage conservatives intended to try to promote [...] if marriage is a product that conservatives desperately want to sell, the smartest thing they could do right now is to hire Beyoncé and Jay-Z as a product spokescouple... they made marriage look fun, and sexy, and a source of mutual professional fulfillment." [...] On public reaction to the sexual performance, Lavanya Ramanathan of The Washington Post wrote: [...] "The Internet exploded, and it's not surprising. This is a couple who sat separately at awards ceremonies when they were dating several years ago." [...] On February 1, 2014, the couple performed the song again during Jay Z's performance at the DirecTv pre-Super Bowl party. Christopher R. Weingarten of Rolling Stone referred to the pair's chemistry as the highlight of the event and said the performance was [...] "smiles <b>and</b> <b>hugs</b> and laughs, with one of the most famous rappers in the world gladly playing hypeman" [...] in contrast to the Grammy performance. Nekesa Mumbi Moody writing for the Associated Press felt that it was the set's highlight. At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards on August 25, 2014, Beyoncé performed [...] "Drunk in Love" [...] live during a medley consisting of songs from her self-titled album. The performance featured the singer dressed in a bejeweled bodysuit and a singalong from the audience. She started the performance on a set of steps, with numerous dancers in headstands around her and went to the stage afterwards.
