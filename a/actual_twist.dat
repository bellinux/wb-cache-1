40|$|Twist {{drilling}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} used machining operations in manufacturing conventional and innovative materials. The accuracy of geometries produced by drilling relies on many factors ranging from materials to, drill geometry, machining parameters and cutting edge conditions. As the dimension of the drills decreases, the cutting force makes the deformation of the drill more critical; consequently the accuracy of the hole decreases. This paper presents an approach to assess the relationships between the <b>actual</b> <b>twist</b> drill geometry and the deformation of the bit drill in order to evaluate the accuracy of the manufactured hole...|$|E
40|$|New {{designs of}} 90 ° twists for {{integrated}} rectangular waveguide applications are introduced. Three different design variants arepresented which comprise several advantages corn-pared to discrete twisted waveguides. First, the designs are ma-chinable as required for integrated waveguide technology. Secondly, {{they are extremely}} short (one sixteenth of a wave-length) and, therefore, ideally suited for application in satellite communication waveguide bands. Thirdly, the guides connected to the <b>actual</b> <b>twist</b> section can be of different cross-section which reduces {{the need for additional}} impedance transformers. And fi-nally, only rectangular instead of L-shaped cross-sections are utilized. Hence CAD procedures are simplified significantly, and the softwore is operational on personal computers. The theoretical model used is verified by measurements at the fundamental step discontinuity formed by two double-plane offset-connected waveguides. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{computer-aided}} design of new machin-able rectangular waveguide twists for integrated waveguide technology is introduced. The novel 90 de-gree twist components require only purely rectangular waveguide sections. This allows fabrication by mod-ern CNC machines and, {{at the same}} time, simplifies {{computer-aided design}} procedures since the eigen-functions of all individual sections involved are well determined. Three different design guidelines are pre-sented for operation at the lower end, the medium range and {{the upper end of}} a waveguide band. The guides connected to the <b>actual</b> <b>twist</b> section can be of different cross-section which might eliminate the need for additional impedance transformers. The 90 -degree twist component is extremely short and, therefore, ide-ally suited for application in satellite communication systems. Finally, a 270 -degree twist component is dis-cussed with respect to bandwidth enlargement...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{quotient}} and "blow-up" of graph-of-groups G {{and of their}} automorphisms H: G→G. We show {{that the existence of}} such a "blow-up" of H̅: G̅→G̅ relative to a given family of "local" graph-of-groups isomorphisms H_i: G_i→G_i depends crucially on the H_i-conjugacy class of the correction term δ(E̅_i) for any edge E̅_i of G̅, where H-congjugacy is a new but natural concept introduced here. As an application we obtain a criterion as to whether a partial Dehn twist can be blown up relative to local Dehn twists to give an <b>actual</b> Dehn <b>twist...</b>|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{wind tunnel}} tests {{have been carried}} out on a modern {{transport}} aircraft wing in transonic flow. The objective was to measure steady and unsteady pressure distributions, and to investigate the influence of the variable twist distribution of an elastic wing. For this purpose the wind tunnel model was scaled in stiffness, so that the twist distribution was similar to a representative aircraft, and changed with loads variation. The extensive model instrumentation consisted of opto-electronical equipment to measure the <b>actual</b> wing <b>twist</b> distribution. The forced model oscillation in pitch and bending up to a reduced frequency of about 0, 7 (based on a reference chord) was measured with conventional accelerometers. A piezo-electrical balance was used for steady and unsteady forces measurement. Steady and unsteady pressures were measured simultaneously with 290 pressure transducers. Investigated parameters were Mach number, stagnation pressure, angle of incidence, reduced frequency and oscillation amplitude...|$|R
50|$|One unique {{difference}} in this franchise is in the status of castaways who are evacuated to the hospital nearest to {{the setting of the}} game. Instead of being declared as eliminated at the point of evacuation, a castaway being sent to the hospital due to apparent injury or ailment is reminded to return to the game within 24 hours; otherwise, they are officially declared as eliminated from the game. One exception was with Survivor Philippines: Celebrity Doubles Showdown castaway, Stef Prescott, who had been brought to a hospital in Manila after she was bitten by a Philippine cobra at Bulan camp. She was on treatment and observation for two days. Throughout the two-day absence from the game, she missed the <b>actual</b> Tribal Shuffle <b>twist,</b> a Tribal Immunity Challenge, and a Tribal Council. She came back on Day 13. Of the eight castaways across four seasons so far who were sent to the hospital with this reminder, all returned to the game, with one (Niña Ortiz from the first season) deciding to leave soon after her return from the hospital due to injury.|$|R
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the serial, Journal of the Textile Institute [Taylor and Francis / © The Textile Institute]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] image analysis techniques in the spatial and frequency domains for twist measurement of yarns are described. A spatial technique is developed to extract the twist angle through the analysis of the yarn core image. Then, a Fourier transformation technique is applied to yarn images to measure the orientation of the fibre on the yarn surface. Finally, a hybrid method that incorporates frequency domain filtering prior to spatial analysis is proposed. The trials show that spatial analysis is a fast method and can successfully predict the twist in the yarn. Fourier transformation technique is quite sensitive to the protruding fibres obstructing the yarn surface, which may result in measurements having high variations. For yarns having little amount of hairs protruding from the core, the results agreed reasonably well with <b>actual</b> <b>twist</b> levels. Frequency domain filtering in conjunction with the spatial analysis of the yarn surface is found to be superior in terms of accuracy. The twist values calculated using the more reliable diameter measurements with back-lit images together with twist angles from the front-lit images are found to be more accurate when compared with the actual values...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. The aims of this {{qualitative}} descriptive {{exploratory study}} were to (1) describe informal caregiver commitment in informal caregiving; (2) describe caregiver expectations in informal caregiving; (3) describe caregiver role negotiation in informal caregiving, (4) identify other important caregiver energy sources; and (5) refine the conceptual model of Informal Caregiving Dynamics {{based on the}} study results. ^ Methods. Participants were 40 informal caregivers of blood and marrow transplant patients being treated at a comprehensive cancer center who told their caregiving stories in an audiotaped dialogue. Patients consented to have their caregivers contacted about the study and to have information collected from their medical records. To address the specific aims, the dialogues were analyzed for major elements and themes with an adaptation of the descriptive exploratory method. ^ Findings. Commitment was redefined as enduring caregiver responsibility that inspires life changes to make the patient a priority. Commitment calls caregivers to supportive presence and self-affirming loving connection with the patient. Expectation management was defined as envisioning the future and yearning to return to normal. Expectation management includes taking {{one day at a}} time, gauging behavior from past experiences with the patient, and reconciling anticipated to <b>actual</b> treatment <b>twists</b> and turns. Role negotiation was defined as appropriate pushing by the caregiver toward patient recovery and independence after getting a handle on complex care that demands shared responsibilities. Role negotiation happens as caregivers determine action with attention to patient voice and vigilantly bridge communication between patients and the health care system. Three additional energy sources of caring for self, gaining insight, and connecting with others, were identified and added to the model as underpinnings for commitment, expectation, and role negotiation respectively. ^ Discussion and implications. Methods of supporting informal caregivers that deserve investigation include consistent acknowledgment of caregiver contribution to patient care; provision of clear, present-focused information; opportunities to reconcile expectations with outcomes by developing a coherent caregiving story; and encouragement to maintain good health habits while caregiving. Patient contribution to the dynamics of caregiving warrants future research attention as does change in energy sources over time as a caregiver. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) is {{a rapidly}} growing tumor associated with a high propensity for vascular invasion and metastasis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key event in the tumor invasion process. Recently, Twist has been identified {{to play an important}} role in EMT-mediated metastasis through the regulation of E-cadherin expression. However, the <b>actual</b> role of <b>Twist</b> in tumor invasiveness remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to investigate the expression and possible role of Twist in HCC. Experimental Design: We evaluated Twist and E-cadherin expression in HCC tissue microarray of paired primary and metastatic HCC by immunohistochemical staining. The role of Twist in EMT-mediated invasiveness was also evaluated in vitro in HCC cell lines. Results: We first showed that overexpression of Twist was correlated with HCC metastasis (P = 0. 001) and its expression was negatively correlated with E-cadherin expression (P = 0. 001, r = - 0. 443) by tissue microarray. A significant increase of Twist at the mRNA level was also found in metastatic HCC cell lines MHCC- 97 H, MHCC- 97 L, and H 2 M when compared with nonmetastatic Huh- 7, H 2 P, and PLC cell lines. The MHCC- 97 H cell line, which has a higher metastatic ability, was found to have a higher level of Twist than MHCC- 97 L. Accompanied with increased Twist expression in the metastatic HCC cell lines when compared with the nonmetastatic primary ones, we found decreased E-cadherin mRNA expression in the metastatic HCC cell lines. By ectopic transfection of Twist into PLC cells, Twist was able to suppress E-cadherin expression and induce EMT changes, which was correlated with increased HCC cell invasiveness. Conclusion: This study shows that Twist overexpression was correlated with HCC metastasis through induction of EMT changes and HCC cell invasiveness. © 2006 American Association for Cancer Research. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|While a {{link between}} {{magnitudes}} of spinal axial twist motions and the various modes of associated injury, pain reporting, and lost time claims has been tentatively established, there is need for greater investigation {{and understanding of the}} mechanical impact of axial twist motions. Researchers have compiled data sets demonstrating the relationship between twisting motions and moments and low back injury outcomes, but do not create a link to gross occupational exposures. Further, few studies can create a direct relationship between workstation design, trunk postures, and spine joint specific pain and failure mechanisms. When this limited mechanistic understanding is paired with injury prevalence statistics, they highlight a clear need to investigate the role of tissue-level axial twist exposures on occupational injury risk and workstation design guidelines to mitigate that risk. The global objective of this research was focused on developing a relationship between working axial twist postures and intervertebral joint injury risk. The four specific questions asked were (1) What is the relationship between externally measured thoracopelvic axial <b>twist</b> and the <b>actual</b> segmental axial <b>twist</b> motion of the intervertebral joints? (2) Can we use ultrasound as a modality to consistently and accurately measure vertebral axial twist motion? (3) What amount of lumbar axial twist presents an elevated injury risk for working populations? (4) What movement strategies do people use to perform reaching tasks at different hand locations, and how do task parameters impact these strategies? Study 1 : Ultrasound has the potential for use to evaluate boney movement during axial twist of the lumbar spine in both in vivo and in vitro evaluations. Such segmental rotations could then be measured under controlled external thoracic axial twist conditions and in response to mechanical loading. The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure vertebral segmental rotations in a porcine model of the human lumbar spine using an ultrasound imaging protocol, and to validate use of this imaging technique with an optical motion capture system. Twelve porcine functional spinal units were fixed to a mechanical testing system, and compression (15 % of compressive tolerance), flexion-extension, and axial twist (0, 2, 4, or 6 degrees) were applied. Axial twist motion was tracked using an optical motion capture system and posterior surface ultrasound. Correlation between the two measurement systems was greater than 0. 903 and absolute system error was 0. 014 across all flexion-extension postures. These findings indicate that ultrasound can be used to track axial twist motion in an in vitro spine motion segment and has the potential for use in vivo to evaluate absolute intervertebral axial twist motion. Study 2 : The relationship between externally measured and internal spine axial twist motion is not well understood. Ultrasound is a validated technique (Study 1) for measurement of vertebral axial twist motion and has the potential for measuring segmental vertebral axial twist in vivo. The purpose of this study was to evaluate lumbar segmental axial twist in relation to external thoracopelvic twist using an ultrasound imaging technique. Sixteen participants kneeled in a custom-built axial twist jig which isolated motion to the lumbar spine. Participants twisted from neutral to 75 % of maximum twist range of motion in an upright flexion-extension posture. Thoracopelvic motion was recorded with a motion capture system and L 1 to S 1 vertebral axial twist was recorded using ultrasound. Maximum thoracopelvic axial twist motion was 41. 1 degrees. The majority of axial twist motion occurred at the L 2 -L 3 (46. 8 % of lumbar axial twist motion) and L 5 -S 1 (33. 5 %) intervertebral joints. Linear regression fits linking axial twist at each vertebral level to thoracopelvic axial twist ranged from 0. 43 to 0. 79. These findings demonstrate a mathematical relationship between internal and external axial twist motion, and suggest that classic use of L 4 -L 5 to represent lumbar spine motion may not be appropriate for axial twist modeling approaches. Study 3 : Axial twisting exposures have been repeatedly identified as a risk factor for occupational low back pain and injury, but there is a need for an improved understanding of the role of axial twist magnitude and associated moment as modifiers of the cumulative load tolerance of intervertebral joints. The purpose of this study was to mathematically characterize the relationship between axial twist motion magnitudes and the cumulative load tolerance of porcine cervical functional spinal units. Twenty-four porcine functional spinal units were fixed in a mechanical testing system under compressive load (15 % of compressive tolerance) and in a neutral flexion-extension posture. Specimens were axially twisted to 5, 7. 5, 10, 12. 5, 15 or 17. 5 degrees at 1 Hz until failure or 21 600 total cycles. Cumulative applied axial twist was recorded, and exponential functions were fit to the twist magnitude-cumulative twist moment recordings. Weighting-factor functions for cumulative axial twist moment injury risk were developed based on absolute axial twist magnitude and twist normalized to maximum range of motion. The non-linear weighting-factors have potential use in assessment of cumulative axial twist injury risk in occupational tasks. Study 4 : The magnitude of axial twist in the lumbar spine in relation to reaching tasks is currently unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate lumbar spine axial twist during simulated occupational tasks across a range of forward and lateral reach distances, task heights, and exertion directions. Twenty-four participants performed single-handed, right-handed exertions against a load cell in three directions (upward, downward, forward push), at two heights (shoulder, elbow), and at 11 different hand target locations corresponding to current ergonomic reach guidelines. Thoracopelvic and right upper limb postures were recorded using an optical motion capture system, and trunk muscle activation was recorded using surface electromyography. Participants performed a contralateral twist at both the thoracopelvic spine and pelvis about the feet for directly forward hand targets, and twisted up to 19. 9 degrees and 12. 1 degrees at the lumbar spine and pelvis, respectively, at the most lateral hand target locations. Lumbar flexion and shoulder elevation each increased with reach distance to a maximum of 5. 6 degrees and 64. 9 degrees, respectively, at the furthest, directly forward hand target location. Hip and abdominal muscle activation exceeded 10 % MVC for the most lateral hand target locations, and exhibited the highest activation for upward and forward push exertions. These findings suggest that future ergonomics guidelines should assess reaching and exertion tasks to hand target locations beyond 60 -degrees from the midline of the body and consider them as non-optimal zones. The collection of studies in this thesis was structured to improve current ergonomics reach guidelines and provide a physiological and biomechanical basis for reach distance recommendations incorporating the low back. The findings from these studies have important implications for researchers, ergonomists, and clinicians assessing injury risk related to twisted occupational postures...|$|R
