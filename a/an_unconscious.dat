5|$|The high intelligence, {{initiative}} and self-direction of Labradors in working roles is exemplified by dogs such as Endal, who during a 2001 emergency placed <b>an</b> <b>unconscious</b> {{human being in}} the recovery position, retrieved his mobile phone from beneath the car, fetched a blanket and covered him, barked at nearby dwellings for assistance, and then ran to a nearby hotel to obtain help. A number of Labradors have also been taught to assist their owner in removing money and credit cards from ATMs with prior training.|$|E
5|$|The innate {{sexuality}} of bloodsucking {{can be seen}} in its intrinsic {{connection with}} cannibalism and folkloric one with incubus-like behaviour. Many legends report various beings draining other fluids from victims, <b>an</b> <b>unconscious</b> association with semen being obvious. Finally Jones notes that when more normal aspects of sexuality are repressed, regressed forms may be expressed, in particular sadism; he felt that oral sadism is integral in vampiric behaviour.|$|E

40|$|The word “seduction” is from Latin “sed/ducere” {{which means}} “to draw aside”. Adam and Eva are taken aside by the snake {{and this is}} a {{religious}} argument in which psychoanalysis is very interested, particularly Freud who wrote about religion defining it an illusion, while Jung said that religion is <b>a</b> man’s <b>unconscious</b> function and atheism is not actually possible. In this work, Freud and Jung are compared to achieve a clear understanding of religion and transfert, because transfert is not only a seduction but also <b>a</b> <b>unconscious</b> work during which patient compares his psychoanalyst whit God. In this work there is a fusion of psychoanalysis and philosophy: Plato, Kant, Feuerbach and Nietzsche build an alternative way of reading religion and man’s sou...|$|R

5|$|The {{closely related}} field of letter-preference {{research}} {{dates back to}} the 1950s. In 1985, Belgian psychologist Nuttin reported the surprising finding that people tend to disproportionately prefer, unknowingly, the letters of their own name. The name-letter effect has been replicated in dozens of follow-up studies in different languages, cultures and alphabets, no matter whether participants selected their preferred letter from a random pair, or picked the top six of all letters in the alphabet, or rated each individual letter. Nuttin predicted that because {{the driving force behind the}} name-letter effect is <b>an</b> <b>unconscious</b> preference for anything connected to the self, there should also be a birthday-number effect.|$|E
5|$|With {{help from}} Pyro, Lehnsherr {{recruits}} Callisto {{and several other}} mutants. They attack the mobile prison holding Mystique to free her, also freeing Juggernaut and Multiple Man. Mystique saves Lehnsherr by taking {{a shot of the}} mutant cure aimed at him, rendering Raven Darkhölme human. Hateful of humans, Lehnsherr abandons Darkhölme, much to her shock and disappointment.

Sensing trouble, Xavier sends Logan and Storm to investigate. When they arrive, they find only telekinetically floating rocks, Summers' glasses, and <b>an</b> <b>unconscious</b> Jean.|$|E
50|$|Analytical {{psychology}} {{distinguishes between}} <b>a</b> personal <b>unconscious</b> and <b>a</b> collective <b>unconscious.</b> The collective unconscious contains archetypes {{common to all}} human beings. That is, individuation may bring to surface symbols that do not relate to the life experiences of a single person. This content is more easily viewed as answers to the more fundamental questions of humanity: life, death, meaning, happiness, fear. Among these more spiritual concepts may arise and {{be integrated into the}} personality.|$|R

5|$|In the Mediterranean Sea, Italian {{fishermen}} rescue <b>an</b> <b>unconscious</b> American (Matt Damon) floating adrift {{with two}} gunshot wounds in his back. They tend to his wounds, {{and when the}} man wakes, they find he suffers from dissociative amnesia. He has no memory of his own identity, while he retains his speech and finds himself capable of advanced combat skills and fluency in several languages. The skipper finds a tiny laser projector under the man's hip that, when activated, gives a number of a safe deposit box in Zürich. Upon landing in Imperia (Italy), the man heads to the bank in Switzerland to investigate the deposit box. He finds it contains a large sum of money in various currencies, numerous passports and identity cards with his picture on all of them, and a handgun. The man takes everything but the gun, and leaves, opting to use {{the name on the}} American passport, Jason Bourne.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{brings the}} gun to the FBI for {{comparison}} against the bullet that killed Bill. When Mulder awakens, he becomes angry and suspicious towards Scully. Later returning to his building, Scully finds his water being contaminated. As Mulder is entering in his building, he spots Krycek, whom he disarms and prepares to kill. However, Scully shoots him {{to prevent him from}} doing so, allowing Krycek to escape. Scully brings <b>an</b> <b>unconscious</b> Mulder to New Mexico and, when he awakens, reveals that his behavior was caused by a drug placed into his water supply and that she shot him because if he had killed Krycek, it then would have been harder to prove his innocence in his father's death. She then introduces him to Hosteen, who has been translating the files on the digital tape.|$|E
5|$|The prosecution's {{theory of}} the case, as told in its opening {{statement}} to the jury, was that Thornton, having failed {{in his attempt to}} seduce Ashford, lay in wait for her in the field near the pit. He knew she would have to cross the field on her return from Erdington. On perceiving him, she attempted to elude him, but he caught her and got her to accompany him into the next field. There, he threw her down and ravished her. The post-mortem showed that she had not eaten in 24hours, and according to the prosecuting counsel, she was unable to resist and fainted. Fearing the consequences were he to be caught with <b>an</b> <b>unconscious</b> woman whom he had treated in such a manner, Thornton threw her into the pit, where she drowned. At that time, defence counsel were not permitted to address the jury, and the matter proceeded with the prosecution case.|$|E

50|$|Cures for {{possession}} by the devil focused on spiritual salvation and {{were aimed at}} getting to <b>a</b> person’s <b>unconscious</b> and unacceptable impulses and wishes. Many people who confessed under the duress of torture {{may well have been}} releasing repressed material. In all likelihood, pain stimulated <b>a</b> flood of <b>unconscious</b> crimes, such as murderous rage against authority figures, incest wishes, or any number of socially determined offenses.|$|R
5|$|The realistic-looking {{effects of}} the astronauts {{floating}} weightless in space and inside the spacecraft were accomplished by suspending the actors from wires attached {{to the top of}} the set, and placing the camera underneath them. The actors' bodies blocked the camera's view of the suspension wires, creating a very believable appearance of floating. For the shot of Poole floating into the pod's arms during Bowman's rescue attempt, a stuntman replaced a dummy on the wire to realistically portray the movements of <b>an</b> <b>unconscious</b> human, and was shot in slow motion to enhance the illusion of drifting through space. The scene showing Bowman entering the emergency airlock from the E.V.A. pod was done in a similar way: an off-camera stagehand, standing on a platform, held the wire suspending Dullea above the camera positioned at the bottom of the vertically configured airlock. At the proper moment, the stagehand first loosened his grip on the wire, causing Dullea to fall toward the camera, then, while holding the wire firmly, he jumped off the platform, causing Dullea to ascend back up toward the hatch.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} American {{soldiers and}} Partisans fight the Germans. Sam is fatally wounded after being shot twice while carrying <b>an</b> <b>unconscious</b> Angelo and dies from his injuries. Bishop and Negron hold off the Germans while Stamps tries {{to move the}} villagers to safety, but they are too heavily outnumbered. Renata and Stamps are killed, and Bishop dies after successfully reviving Angelo. Negron, in the retreat, is {{shot in the back}} and is saved by the radio. After Angelo gives him the Head of the Primavera, Negron gives the boy his rosary and tells him to leave. Negron is spared by a disillusioned German officer who hands over his own Luger and tells Negron to defend himself. American soldiers arrive and secure the village before evacuating the wounded Negron, the sole survivor of the German attack.|$|E
5|$|Verger bribes Justice Department {{official}} Paul Krendler {{to accuse}} Starling of withholding {{a note from}} Lecter, leading to her suspension. Lecter lures Starling to Union Station. Verger's men, having trailed Starling, capture and bring Lecter to Verger. Verger intends to feed Lecter alive to a herd of wild boars bred specifically for this purpose. After her superiors refuse to act, Starling infiltrates Verger's estate. After neutralizing the two guards and freeing Lecter, she is shot by a third guard who was in hiding. Lecter picks up <b>an</b> <b>unconscious</b> Starling just before the boars break through the doors. Verger orders his physician Cordell Doemling to shoot Lecter, but, with Lecter's suggestion, Cordell shoves his hated boss into the pen. Lecter carries Starling and watches the boars eat Verger alive.|$|E
