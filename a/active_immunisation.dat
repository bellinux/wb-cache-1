All infants born to HBsAg positive mothers at the University Women`s Hospital in Basel, Switzerland, in 2001 were identified and post-exposure immunisations were analysed. In addition, detailed written information on subsequent hepatitis B immunisations was obtained from the infants` paediatricians.

40|$|Due to the omnipresent risk of epidemics, insect {{societies}} have evolved sophisticated disease defences {{at the individual}} and colony level. An intriguing yet little understood phenomenon is that social contact to pathogen-exposed individuals reduces susceptibility of previously naive nestmates to this pathogen. We tested whether such social immunisation in Lasius ants against the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae is based on active upregulation {{of the immune system}} of nestmates following contact to an infectious individual or passive protection via transfer of immune effectors among group members [...] that is, <b>active</b> versus passive <b>immunisation.</b> We found no evidence for involvement of passive immunisation via transfer of antimicrobials among colony members. Instead, intensive allogrooming behaviour between naive and pathogen-exposed ants before fungal conidia firmly attached to their cuticle suggested passage of the pathogen from the exposed individuals to their nestmates. By tracing fluorescence-labelled conidia we indeed detected frequent pathogen transfer to the nestmates, where they caused low-level infections as revealed by growth of small numbers of fungal colony forming units from their dissected body content. These infections rarely led to death, but instead promoted an enhanced ability to inhibit fungal growth and an active upregulation of immune genes involved in antifungal defences (defensin and prophenoloxidase, PPO). Contrarily, there was no upregulation of the gene cathepsin L, which is associated with antibacterial and antiviral defences, and we found no increased antibacterial activity of nestmates of fungus-exposed ants. This indicates that social immunisation after fungal exposure is specific, similar to recent findings for individual-level immune priming in invertebrates. Epidemiological modeling further suggests that <b>active</b> social <b>immunisation</b> is adaptive, as it leads to faster elimination of the disease and lower death rates than passive immunisation. Interestingly, humans have also utilised the protective effect of low-level infections to fight smallpox by intentional transfer of low pathogen doses ("variolation" or "inoculation") ...|$|R
40|$|Screening of {{pregnant}} women for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in three areas of Holland led to the identification of HBsAg carriers, 20 of whom were subsequently delivered. Within two hours after birth all infants received hepatitis B immune globulin (0. 5 ml/kg body weight) and, after randomisation, hepatitis B vaccine (10 micrograms) was given either at 0, 1, and 2 months of age or at 3, 4, and 5 months of age, the latter concomitantly with DPTP vaccination. Eighteen infants complying with the protocol were followed up {{for at least six}} months.

40|$|Smoking {{has been}} {{identified}} as the single largest preventable cause of morbidity and premature death in the developed world. Despite the well known health risks associated with smoking the number of smokers are still rising globally. Available aids in smoking cessation have only limited effectiveness and, therefore, there is a great need for improved treatment in this area. The present set of studies analysed the effects of two novel potential treatment alternatives for smoking cessation; <b>active</b> <b>immunisation</b> against nicotine with the nicotine immunoconjugate IP 18 -KLH and the dopamine stabiliser (-) -DS 121. The aim of the present thesis was to evaluate the effect of these treatments on several aspects of nicotine dependence. First we evaluated their actions on acute effects of nicotine in brain. An increase in dopamine (DA) output is observed in the nucleus accumbens (NAC) following acute administration of most dependenceproducing drugs, including nicotine. This effect {{has been shown to be}} critically involved in the reinforcing effect of the drugs, and it is presumed to be important for the acquisition of dependence. Using in vivo voltammetry and in vivo microdialysis the effects, of these treatments on the nicotine-induced increase in DA output in the NAC were examined. Active immuniation with IP 18 -KLH potently blocked the nicotine-induced increase in DA output in the NAC. The effect of (-) -DS 121 was less pronounced showing a significant effect only on DOPAC output. The effect of <b>active</b> <b>immunisation</b> with IP 18 -KLH on acute injections of nicotine was further evaluated measuring reward thresholds, using intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) in both nicotine na√Øve- and previously nicotine-exposed animals. The results show that the facilitating effect of nicotine on reward thresholds was attenuated by <b>active</b> <b>immunisation</b> with IP 18 -KLH. Measuring reward thresholds we also observed that <b>active</b> <b>immunisation</b> with IP 18 -KLH does not precipitate nicotine withdrawal, as measured by a lack of increase in reward thresholds during continuous nicotine administration. The effects of the two treatments on different aspects of nicotine withdrawal were also studied. A decrease in DA output in the NAC is observed during precipitated nicotine withdrawal, as well as an increase in somatic signs. Furthermore, nicotine withdrawal is associated with an increase in reward thresholds. During withdrawal we measured DA output in the NAC using in vivo microdialysis and, furthermore, assessed somatic signs. The effect of <b>active</b> <b>immunisation</b> with IP 18 -KLH on nicotine withdrawal was also evaluated measuring reward thresholds. These measures reflect different aspects of the withdrawal reaction, which are considered to contribute to abstinence symptoms experienced during a quit attempt and to promote early relapse. We observed that both <b>active</b> <b>immunisation</b> with IP 18 -KLH or treatment with (-) -DS 121 attenuated the decrease in DA output in the NAC following precipitated nicotine withdrawal and, furthermore, attenuated the increase in somatic abstinence signs dining precipitated (-) -DS 121), or spontaneous (<b>active</b> <b>immunisation),</b> withdrawal. <b>Active</b> <b>immunisation</b> with IP 18 -KLH was furthermore shown to attenuate the increase in reward thresholds during spontaneous withdrawal. Finally, we evaluated the effect of <b>active</b> <b>immunisation</b> with IP 18 -KLH on the nicotine-induced reinstatement of nicotineseeking behaviour. This experiment was designed to imitate the situation of drug-induced relapse. Long-term relapse prevention has been pointed out as the major obstacle to overcome in smoking cessation treatment. Our results show that <b>active</b> <b>immunisation</b> with IP 18 -KLH effectively prevents reinstatement of nicotine-seeking behaviour following administration of a small priming doses of nicotine. In summary, the results from the present thesis provide evidence that both <b>active</b> <b>immunisation</b> against nicotine and the DA stabiliser (-) -DS 121 may be effective as treatments for smoking cessation. Our data indicate that <b>active</b> <b>immunisation</b> with IP 18 -KLH attenuates the acute rewarding effects of nicotine, that the immunisation does not precipitate withdrawal by itself, that it may attenuate nicotine withdrawal and, most significantly that it prevents reinstatement in nicotineseeking behaviour in an experimental relapse model. Furthermore, our results indicate that the dopamine stabiliser (-) DS 121 may be effective in attenuating the nicotine withdrawal reaction...|$|E

40|$|Anti-ganglioside {{antibodies}} {{have been}} implicated in autoimmune neuropathies for several decades. They are thought to elicit injury through binding to sites in the peripheral nervous system, where they activate the complement pathway to induce cell death. Patient serum is therefore regularly screened for these antibodies {{to aid in the}} diagnosis of various conditions. Recent work has found that complexes composed of gangliosides and other glycolipids can improve the detection of these antibodies beyond the signals detected to the single ganglioside species. In MMN research, complexes comprised of GM 1 and GalC have been found to significantly enhance antibody detection in patient sera. In certain patients, however, antibody binding was only detected against these complexes and not the single antigens. This led some researchers to hypothesise that an unidentified class of antibody may have arisen that binds specifically to a neoepitope formed by the combination of the two glycolipids. It has also been hypothesised that that this complex may be the true target of immune mediated attack in MMN. This thesis sought to address this hypothesis by either cloning these antibodies directly from patient serum or through <b>active</b> <b>immunisations</b> with mice. Analysis of previously generated human monoclonal antibodies indicated that their behaviours were modified by complexes containing particular gangliosides or glycolipids. Furthermore, the antibodies behaviours were found to diverge, when they were screened against complexes comprised of gangliosides and different concentrations of accessory lipids. These findings suggested that the accessory lipids were interacting with the ganglioside headgroups to modify the presentation of different binding epitopes. This indicated that conformational modulation, rather than neo-epitope formation, may be responsible for complex enhancement Cloning antibodies from patient sera was unsuccessful but examination of the screening techniques suggested that the appearance of complex-dependent antibodies may have been an artefact. Attempts to induce complex-specific responses in mice were similarly unsuccessful but several anti-ganglioside and anti-sulfatide antibodies were created. The subsequent chapters focused on the characterisation of these antibodies and indicated that most of them bound well to solid-phase assays, cells and tissue and may therefore be of use in future studies. Taken together, the data from this thesis suggests that complex-dependent antibodies may not exist but are merely low concentrations of anti-ganglioside antibodies that are cis-enhanced by particular lipids. Future work should therefore focus on assessing how the ganglioside microenvironment modifies epitope presentation and how this affects the binding capabilities of antiganglioside antibodies...|$|R

The programme was offered in England and Wales from November 1982. Passive immunisation alone was available {{in the first six}} months of life until 1985, after which infants received passive and <b>active</b> <b>immunisation</b> from birth; in addition, some infants received passive immunisation for six months followed by a course of hepatitis B vaccine. All but a few infants received the first immunising dose within 48 hours after birth. Blood samples for analysing markers of hepatitis B virus were available at 1 year from 147 of the 223 infants given passive immunisation, 54 of the 72 given passive followed by <b>active</b> <b>immunisation,</b> and 102 of the 155 given passive and <b>active</b> <b>immunisation</b> at birth. At 1 year 11 of the 127 (9 %) infants given four or more doses of specific hepatitis B immunoglobulin were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen compared with four of the 20 given three or fewer doses; 11 had levels of hepatitis B surface antibody greater than 50 IU/l. Only one of the 54 infants given passive then <b>active</b> <b>immunisation</b> was positive for hepatitis B surface antigen at 1 year and four infants had low (less than or equal to 50 IU/l) levels of hepatitis B surface antibody. Four of the 102 infants who received passive and <b>active</b> <b>immunisation</b> at birth were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen.

40|$|For lack of {{relevant}} {{data of the}} literature, the tetanus immunisation results obtained in the two sexes were compared in an animal model. Complete immunisation series of weaned, adult and aged guinea-pigs (20 ‚Äì 25 animals/group) were performed with aluminium phosphate (AlPO 4) adsorbed purified tetanus toxoid (PTAP) {{as well as with}} typhoid-tetanus vaccine (TY-TE) containing lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Both vaccines contained 5. 0 Lf (limes flocculans, Ramon) per single dose of tetanus toxoid, purity degree: 1500 Lf/mg protein nitrogen (PN). Tetanus antitoxin titres (TAT) were measured after the first shot, and subsequently before and after booster. Compared to TAT of male animals, significantly lower titres were found in female animals after basic immunisation with PTAP in all the three age groups: 1. 03 vs. 0. 57, 8. 75 vs. 5. 64, and 0. 27 vs. 0. 15 IU (international units, related to the Copenhagen International Standard) per ml (sex-chromosome-dependent differences), as well as in adult animals immunised with TY-TE, before booster: 0. 07 vs. 0. 02 IU/ml (hormone-dependent differences). In the latter case the TAT results after booster were 14. 49 vs. 12. 89 IU/ml. Thus, the lower female prebooster titres were counterbalanced by a quick and effective increase of titres following booster. These results are in accordance with our previous observations in humans (R√©thy and R√©thy, 1986). From our observations with tetanus immunisation series on guinea-pigs it can be concluded that TAT may be influenced by the effects of sex chromosomes as well as of sexual hormones. During <b>active</b> anti-tetanus <b>immunisation</b> with LPS-containing vaccine (TY-TE) the lower adult female prebooster titres are presumably counterbalanced by the better functionality of the female immune memory. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To assess current {{knowledge}} {{about the potential for}} sexual transmission of the hepatitis viruses A-E and G and how to prevent any such transmission. METHOD: A search of published literature identified through Medline 1966 -June 1998 (Ovid v 3. 0), the Cochrane Library and reference lists taken from each article obtained. Textword and MeSH searches for hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, G, delta, GB virus, GBV-C were linked to searches under the textword terms sex$, vaccine$, prevent$, and MeSH subheadings, epidemiology, transmission, prevention, and control. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence for heterosexual transmission of hepatitis B, C, D, and G and homosexual transmission of hepatitis A-D and G. Condoms are an effective method for preventing transmission by penetrative vaginal or anal sex although spread of types A and B are linked also to oro-anal sex.

40|$|The {{pharmacological}} treatment of dementias aims to improve cognitive deficits, {{activities of daily}} living and behavioural and psychiatric symptoms. The weighting of theses therapeutic aims varies with disease progression. Behavioural symptoms may dominate especially in the more severe stages of the disease and may further deteriorate global functional level of the patient. Today there is no causal therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Based on preclinical disease models novel therapeutic approaches are under development that target the beta-amyloid and tau protein metabolism. Some of them aim to inhibit the formation, aggregation and toxicity of beta-amyloid peptides or promote their clearance from the brain. Others inhibit the formation of neurofibrillary tangles or have neuroprotective effects. <b>Active</b> or passive <b>immunisation</b> against beta-amyloid may be a very specific and effective approach. The efficacy of acetylcholine esterase inhibitors (AchEI) in the treatment of mild to moderate AD is well documented. They are first line therapeutics in the treatment of the disease and lead to a delay of symptomatic progression. Memantine is effective in the treatment of moderate to severe stages of AD. The evidence for the treatment of vascular dementia is comparatively weak. However, positive effects have been shown for all available AchEI and memantine. Non pharmacological therapy is an indispensable part of the treatment of dementia patients and should be adapted to the individual needs of the patient in the respective stage of the disease. The efficacy of antipsychotics in the treatment of behavioural and psychiatric symptoms of dementia is limited. These drugs are associated with increased morbidity and mortality in dementia patients.

Methods IFN-K was manufactured by crosslinking huIFNŒ± 2 b to keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). Transgenic mice expressing huIFNŒ± 2 b received by intramuscular injection either saline or polymerised huIFNŒ± 2 b as controls, or IFN-K, emulsifi ed in ISA 51 vg adjuvant. Results All of the huIFNŒ± 2 b-expressing mice immunised with IFN-K generated neutralising antibodies against huIFNŒ± 2 b. In addition, these antibodies neutralised all 13 subtypes of huIFNŒ±. They also neutralised IFNŒ± activity in sera collected from 10 different patients with active SLE. However, the antibodies did not bind to huIFNŒ≥ or huIFNŒ≤. Finally, cellular activation assays showed that immunisation with IFN-K did not induce memory T cells reactive to native huIFNŒ± 2 b, whereas it did induce memory cells reactive to KLH.

40|$|This {{presentation}} highlights {{aspects of}} the immunobiology of the Guillain-Barr√© syndromes (GBS), the world's leading cause of acute autoimmune neuromuscular paralysis. Understanding the key pathophysiological pathways of GBS and developing rational, specific immunotherapies are essential steps towards improving the clinical outcome of this devastating disorder. Much of the research into GBS {{over the last decade}} has focused on the forms mediated by anti-ganglioside antibodies, and we have made substantial progress in our understanding in several related areas. Particular highlights include (a) the emerging correlations between anti-ganglioside antibodies and specific clinical phenotypes, notably between anti-GM 1 /anti-GD 1 a antibodies and the acute motor axonal variant and anti-GQ 1 b/anti-GT 1 a antibodies and the Miller Fisher syndrome; (b) the identification of molecular mimicry between GBS-associated Campylobacter jejuni oligosaccharides and GM 1, GD 1 a, and GT 1 a gangliosides as a mechanism for anti-ganglioside antibody induction; (c) the development of rodent models of GBS with sensory ataxic or motor phenotypes induced by immunisation with GD 1 b or GM 1 gangliosides, respectively. Our work has particularly studied the motor nerve terminal as a model site of injury, and through combined <b>active</b> and passive <b>immunisation</b> paradigms, we have developed murine neuropathy phenotypes mediated by anti-ganglioside antibodies. This has been achieved through use of glycosyltransferase and complement regulator knock-out mice, both for cloning anti-ganglioside antibodies and inducing disease. Through such studies, we have proven a neuropathogenic role for murine anti-ganglioside antibodies and human GBS-associated antisera and identified several determinants that influence disease expression including (a) the level of immunological tolerance to microbial glycans that mimic self-gangliosides; (b) the ganglioside density in target tissue; (c) the level of complement activation and the neuroprotective effects of endogenous complement regulators; and (d) the role of calcium influx through complement pores in mediating axonal injury. Such studies provide us with clear information on an antibody-mediated pathogenesis model for GBS and should lead to rational therapeutic testing of agents that are potentially suitable for use in humans...|$|R
40|$|To {{examine the}} timing and {{duration}} of RSV bronchiolitis hospital admission among term and preterm infants in England and to identify risk factors for bronchiolitis admission. A population-based birth cohort with follow-up to age 1 year, using the Hospital Episode Statistics database. 71 hospitals across England. We identified 296618 individual birth records from 2007 / 08 and linked to subsequent hospital admission records {{during the first year}} of life. In our cohort there were 7189 hospital admissions with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis, 24. 2 admissions per 1000 infants under 1 year (95 %CI 23. 7 - 24. 8), of which 15 % (1050 / 7189) were born preterm (47. 3 bronchiolitis admissions per 1000 preterm infants (95 % CI 44. 4 - 50. 2)). The peak age group for bronchiolitis admissions was infants aged 1 month and the median was age 120 days (IQR‚Ää=‚Ää 61 - 209 days). The median length of stay was 1 day (IQR‚Ää=‚Ää 0 - 3). The relative risk (RR) of a bronchiolitis admission was higher among infants with known risk factors for severe RSV infection, including those born preterm (RR‚Ää=‚Ää 1. 9, 95 % CI 1. 8 - 2. 0) compared with infants born at term. Other conditions also significantly increased risk of bronchiolitis admission, including Down's syndrome (RR‚Ää=‚Ää 2. 5, 95 % CI 1. 7 - 3. 7) and cerebral palsy (RR‚Ää=‚Ää 2. 4, 95 % CI 1. 5 - 4. 0). Most (85 %) of the infants who are admitted to hospital with bronchiolitis in England are born at term, with no known predisposing risk factors for severe RSV infection, although risk of admission is higher in known risk groups. The early age of bronchiolitis admissions has important implications for the potential impact and timing of future <b>active</b> and passive <b>immunisations.</b> More research is needed to explain why babies born with Down's syndrome and cerebral palsy are also at higher risk of hospital admission with RSV bronchiolitis...|$|R
40|$|The {{immunisation}} {{of children}} against communicable diseases {{is a crucial}} public health intervention with both individual and collective outcomes. Current New Zealand immunisation policy prioritises parental autonomy, but has not succeeded in actively targeting all {{of the factors that}} prevent parents from ever making informed immunisation decisions. Consequently, our coverage rates are unsatisfactory both in absolute (by reference to the goal of 'population immunity') and relative terms. In order to have a realistic chance of meeting the Ministry of Health's optimistic coverage targets, it is necessary to consider whether New Zealand's comparatively weak immunisation law could be strengthened to eliminate the phenomenon of 'passive' non-immunisation without fatally undermining the decision-making capacity of parents. If this is not possible, then either the goal of population immunity or the prioritisation of individual choice must be abandoned. Of the three options for law reform explored by this paper, two are thought to be unworkable because they would, or should, be perceived as failing to achieve the delicate balance between individual freedom and public good. These are, first, a universal mandatory immunisation requirement, which may be justifiable in principle but would almost certainly encounter prohibitive public opposition; and, secondly, a targeted law that would require beneficiaries to make <b>active</b> decisions about <b>immunisation,</b> and (it is submitted) represents an unwarranted misuse of the vulnerability of those dependent upon taxpayer support. The reform option recommended is more moderate and more equitable. Creating a legal presumption in favour of immunisation, at the point of entry into primary school, would shift New Zealand from its current paradigm of 'informed consent' - whereby parents must actively opt in to immunisation - to a United States-style model that required parents who wished to opt out of immunisation to undergo a 'informed refusal' process. The stringency of this process would depend upon the degree to which policy-makers were satisfied that only those parents whose deeply held convictions prevented them from being open to persuasion were attempting to invoke it. Unless the size of the anti-immunisation lobby significantly increases, it is suggested that an informed refusal requirement could successfully tackle the problem of passive non-immunisation, thereby discharging the State's responsibility to further the interest of all New Zealanders in achieving and maintaining population immunity levels...|$|R

Trad-itionally, research on protection has focused on the role of humoral immunity and several reports have shown that passive transfer of antibodies against several putative protective antigens, including pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA) and pertactin, can confer a level of protection in mice against in-tracerebral or respiratory challenge?

40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} {{emergence}} of S. aureus strains resistant to multiple antibiotics and the therewith increased mortality rates, the development of alternative strategies to prevent and treat S. aureus infections is of great clinical and economical importance. Based on the results concerning both monovalent <b>active</b> and passive <b>immunisation,</b> it is getting obvious that only multivalent vaccine strategies might confer full protection from S. aureus related infections. Furthermore, due to their short term applicability and potential composition of immunoglobulins of different isotypes and functionalities, strategies based on passive immunisation are particularly advantageous. Using an intravenous immunoglobulin preparation (IVIG) as source of naturally occurring S. aureus specific IgGs, a significant inhibition of staphylococcal growth was observed in vitro. Thus, confirming the bacteriostatic effect on S. aureus as observed using human serum in the 1970 s. Since this inhibitory effect was not observed upon treatment with IVIG depleted of S. aureus - specific IgGs (dSaIVIG), bacteriostasis is triggered solely by S. aureus specific IgGs. In order to analyse the underlying mechanism, gene expression profiling was conducted, using a S. aureus-seven genome PCR-product microarray. Comparison of IVIG to dSaIVIG treated samples led to the identification of 236 differentially expressed genes {{over the course of}} bacteriostasis. In contrast, IVIG compared to PBS treated samples as additional control resulted in 78 genes with altered expression. Only 13 genes were identified by both sets of microarrays, indicating a strong difference between the two applied controls. Moreover, the most prominent signature representing genes related to iron uptake and metabolism was only identified by comparison of IVIG to dSaIVIG samples. qPCR on iron related genes not only verified the microarray results, but also indicated that the iron signature was derived from dSaIVIG, thus not representing the mechanism underlying bacteriostasis. Due to the lack of a reliable signature the mechanism underlying bacteriostasis could not be characterised. Additionally, we aimed to enlarge the repertoire of potential candidates for a polyvalent vaccine. For this purpose a novel subtractive proteomic approach (SUPRA) on anchorless cell wall (ACW) proteins of S. aureus was developed. This method is based on immunodetection of in vivo expressed, immunogenic proteins separated by 2 D gelelectrophoresis with either complete IVIG or dSaIVIG. Proteins immunoreactive with IVIG but not, or to a lesserextent using dSaIVIG were identified by MALDI-TOF analysis. SUPRA led to the identification of 37 new potential vaccine candidates among ACW proteins. Three of these, BT 1, BT 2 and BT 3 were characterised in this study. The surface localisation of these antigens was confirmed by flow cytometry using specific antibodies enriched from IVIG. Purified IgGs for each antigen mediated opsonophagocytosis and subsequent opsonophagocytic killing by human neutrophils. However, when used for monovalent immunisation of BalbC mice only BT 1 and BT 3 conferred significant protection against lethal S. aureus challenge in a murine model of sepsis. Despite the protective potential upon monovalent immunisation a bivalent vaccination using BT 1 and BT 3 did not exhibit a synergistic protective effect, most likely due to the reduced amount of antigen used for immunisation. Among the six so far investigated vaccine candidates identified by SUPRA, three conferred protection against lethal challenge with S. aureus (hp 2160, BT 1 and BT 3) and two led to a reduction of bacterial load in organs (eno and oxo). Therefore, SUPRA represents a valuable tool for the identification of promising vaccine candidates for subsequent use in a multicomponent vaccine against S. aureus. ...|$|R
40|$|Pauci-immune focal necrotising and crescentic {{glomerulonephritis}} (FNCGN) is a severe form of kidney disease {{often associated with}} anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA). Well pocumented. ANCA target proteins. include myeloperoxidase (MPO) and proteinase 3 (PR 3), both contained in the Iysosomes of neutrophils. A study by Kain et al (1995) identified a novel ANCA target; lysosomal associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP- 2) (Kain et aI., 1995) recognised by FNCGN patient sera. An immunodominant epitope shares sequence homology with a peptide found on bacterial adhesion protein fimH (Kain et aI., Manuscript in Preparation). The aim of this work has been to evaluate the pathogenic potential of cross reactive antibodies that bind to both LAMP- 2 and fimH to provide an explanation of how persistent infection can drive chonic inflammatory responses that underpin autoimmune disease. A WKY rat model of FNCGN {{was used to examine}} this concept of molecular mimicry by using both passive and <b>active</b> <b>immunisation</b> schedules. Recombinant fragments of human and rat LAMP- 2 and bacterial fimH were generated and purified √É‚Äö√Ç¬∑following expression in plasmid vectors. The WKY rat model was first passively immunised with rabbit antibodies specific for human LAMP- 2 (hLAMP- 2) to confirm that they had the ability to cross-react with sequence homologous rat LAMP- 2 (rLAMP- 2). Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and ELISA confirmed cross reactivity and further indicated that antihLAMP- 2 resulted in tissue damage similar to that observed in human FNCGN. Further, <b>active</b> <b>immunisation</b> with hLAMP- 2 in the presence of adjuvant was sufficient to break tolerance, generating a pathogenic antibody response specific for both human and rat LAMP- 2.
