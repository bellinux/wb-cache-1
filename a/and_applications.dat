40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to find about the teacher educators’ {{knowledge}} of e-resources <b>and</b> <b>application</b> of ICT. Normative survey method has been used and by using random sampling technique 500 teacher educators’ were selected. Gathered data was analyzed by using appropriate statistical technique. The results show that the level of teacher educators’ knowledge of e-resources is high <b>and</b> <b>application</b> of ICT is favourable. There is significant difference in the knowledge of e-resources <b>and</b> <b>application</b> of ICT among teacher educators with regard to working knowledge about computer. There is no significant difference in the knowledge of e-resources <b>and</b> <b>application</b> of ICT among teacher educators with regard to gender.

40|$|We {{present a}} method of timed HW-SW cosimulation which uses native {{execution}} of OS <b>and</b> <b>application</b> SW. The method presents fast and accurate cosimulation. Since the OS <b>and</b> <b>application</b> SW are executed natively on the simulation host, it gives faster simulation than the case when an instruction set simulator is used. Compared to the conventional usage of native execution of OS <b>and</b> <b>application</b> SW, it presents more accurate simulation since it allows for timing simulation of OS <b>and</b> <b>application</b> SW <b>and</b> it {{can be incorporated into}} timed HW-SW cosimulation. We present the details of building such a fast and accurate SW simulation mode...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 38 - 39) This {{study investigated}} the effects instructional format and number of study trials had on recall <b>and</b> <b>application</b> of statistical concepts. Two instructional formats, verbal and symbolic, were compared for their facilitative effects on a learning task. Subjects were given either one or two study trials under each of the instructional format conditions. Subjects were presented both recall <b>and</b> <b>application</b> problems. A significant correlation between recall <b>and</b> <b>application</b> scores was found in both symbolic format conditions. In the verbal treatment condition, however, the correlation between recall <b>and</b> <b>application</b> scores {{was found to be}} non-significant. Analyses of variance for concept recall <b>and</b> <b>application</b> showed no significant effects for either independent variable. Two analyses of covariance were also performed, using subject background and interest in material as covariates. Again no significant results were obtained. It was concluded that in the present study, instructional format has no significant effect on recall or application of statistical material. (See more in text. ...|$|R
