40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Master of Technology: Chemical Engineering in the Faculty of Engineering at the Cape Peninsula University of TechnologyThroughout the world, many water resources are polluted by industrial and domestic effluents, acid mine drainage, etc. The increasing awareness and concern about the environment has motivated {{in the recent years}} extensive research into developing new efficient, cost effective and environmentally sound technologies to treat industrial solutions bearing metals and sludges. From the literature review, much research has been, and is still being devoted to the performance of solvent extraction (SX) of <b>aluminium</b> or <b>sulphate</b> in acidic solutions and how to improve such performance. There is a general lack of information on liquid-liquid extraction of <b>aluminium</b> or <b>sulphate</b> in an alkaline solution. Thus, the need for a systematic investigation into the solvent extraction of <b>aluminium</b> and <b>sulphate</b> in an alkaline medium was important. This thesis focuses on the study of solvent extraction of <b>aluminium</b> and <b>sulphate</b> from alkaline solutions using Trioctylmethylammonium chloride, (Aliquat 336), in Kerosene as diluent...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{combined}} and individual effects of <b>aluminium</b> and <b>sulphate</b> at concentrations of 1, 000 mg/l as Al(OH) 3, and 150 mgSO 4 2 –/L as K 2 SO 4, respectively, on the anaerobic digestion of sludge from enhanced primary treatment (EPT) were evaluated in 1 L capacity semi continuous reactors. It {{was found that}} at 59 days, aluminium inhibits the specific methanogenic activity (SMA) of methanogenic and acetogenic bacteria resulting in a 50 % to 72 % decrease. Sulphate also inhibits (48 % to 65 %) the SMA of {{the same type of}} bacteria. Methanogenic and acetogenic bacteria were able to adapt, to a different extent, to the assayed concentrations of <b>aluminium</b> and <b>sulphate.</b> However, the combination of <b>aluminium</b> and <b>sulphate</b> resulted in a higher inhibition, especially of the hydrogenophilic methanogenic bacteria. Indeed, this effect remained {{during the time of the}} experiment, maintaining an inhibition of 44 % at 114 days. Feeding with EPT sludge led to a bigger decrease in SMA of each bacterial group, with respect to the other treatments with time. It is concluded that the acidification of anaerobic reactors fed with EPT sludge is due, among other causes, to the concurrent presence of <b>aluminium</b> and <b>sulphate...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{chemical}} foam extinguisher {{was invented in}} 1904 by Aleksandr Loran in Russia, based on his previous invention of fire fighting foam. Loran first used it to extinguish a pan of burning naphtha. It worked and looked similar to the soda-acid type, but the inner parts were slightly different. The main tank contained a solution of sodium bicarbonate in water, whilst the inner container (somewhat larger than the equivalent in a soda-acid unit) contained a solution of <b>aluminium</b> <b>sulphate.</b> When the solutions were mixed, usually by inverting the unit, the two liquids reacted to create a frothy foam, and carbon dioxide gas. The gas expelled the foam {{in the form of}} a jet. Although liquorice-root extracts and similar compounds were used as additives (stabilizing the foam by reinforcing the bubble-walls), there was no [...] "foam compound" [...] in these units. The foam was a combination of the products of the chemical reactions: sodium and aluminium salt-gels inflated by the carbon dioxide. Because of this, the foam was discharged directly from the unit, with no need for an aspirating branchpipe (as in newer mechanical foam types). Special versions were made for rough service, and vehicle mounting, known as apparatus of fire department types. Key features were a screw-down stopper that kept the liquids from mixing until it was manually opened, carrying straps, a longer hose, and a shut-off nozzle. Fire department types were often private label versions of major brands, sold by apparatus manufacturers to match their vehicles. Examples are Pirsch, Ward LaFrance, Mack, Seagrave, etc. These types are some of the most collectible extinguishers as they cross into both the apparatus restoration and fire extinguisher areas of interest.|$|E

40|$|The {{medicinal}} minerals {{of antiquity}} reported in Greco-Latin texts are now understood to consist primarily of layered silicates, sulphates and metal oxides/sulphides, normally {{not in their}} natural state but following some processing. Recent microbiological work on layered silicates from some volcanic islands in the Aegean (Samos) and on samples of archaeological earths in museum collections (terra sigillata, Lemnos), has shown them to be antibacterial.

40|$|Summary. Various {{crystalline}} and X-ray amorphous {{forms of}} aluminium hydr-oxide prepared from sulphate and chloride solutions by varying the mole ratio of NaOH to A 1 a+ have {{been characterized by}} chemical analysis and X-ray diffraction. When the NaOH/A 1 ratio is 3 or 3. 3, crystalline Al(OH) a {{in the form of}} bayerite, nordstrandite, gibbsite, or mixtures is obtained in several hours. When the ratio is 2. 75 or below, no AI(OH) a is evident and the products are X-ray amorphous and remain so even after ageing for six months. Chemical analysis indicates that the amorphous precipitates are basic <b>aluminium</b> <b>sulphates</b> or chlorides. In the 0 to 2. 1 range of NaOH/A 1, the composition of the products is constant, being approximately AI(OH) ~. ~X 0. s. In the 2. 1 to 2. 75 range, a continuous series of basic salts, of com-position ranging from AI(OH) ~. 2 X 0. s to Al(OIt) ~. TsX 0. 25, is obtained. The following hypothesis is proposed to account for the occurrence of X-ray amorphous versus crystalline forms: When NaOH is added to an aluminium salt solution, the initial reaction yields AI(OH) + ions, which polymerize into stable 6 -membered ring units of composition Als(OH) ~ + or multiples thereof (double an...|$|R
