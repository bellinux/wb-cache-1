The remedy {{is to be found}} not, I believe, in any sort of Government control, but in a legal campaign against the one thing harmful--the lie. It would be in the interests of most big advertisers, for most big advertisement is honest; it would be, in the long run, {{in the interests of the}} Press; and it would mean an enormous step forward in the general mental clarity of the world if a deliberate lie, whether in an advertisement or in the news or other columns of the press, was punishable--punishable whether it did or did not involve anything that is now an <b>actionable</b> <b>damage.</b> And it would still further strengthen the print nexus and clear the mind of the world if it were compulsory to correct untrue statements in the periodical press, whether they had been made in good faith or not, at least as conspicuously and lengthily as the original statement. I can see no impossibility in the realization of either of these proposals, and no objection that a really honest newspaper proprietor or advertiser could offer to them. It would make everyone careful, of course, but I fail to see any grievance in that. The sanitary effect upon the festering disputes of our time would be incalculably great. It would be like opening the windows upon a stuffy, overcrowded and unventilated room of disputing people.|$|E

5000|$|Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw {{held that}} the union's actions were not unlawful, because the objects of the union and the action taken of {{threatening}} to stop work to prevent Horne's continued employment, were not unlawful in the law of Massachusetts. This contrasted with the laws in England in 1721, in R v Journeymen Tailors of Cambridge. The union could exercise [...] "a power which might be exerted for useful and honorable purposes, or for dangerous and pernicious ones." [...] But only if an independently unlawful act could be found, which was clearly laid down in the law, could a combination of people {{to do the same}} thing also be unlawful. He pointed out that competition among businesses were often treated the same, and so the economic loss to the employer or Horne could not count as <b>actionable</b> <b>damage.</b> The workers were [...] "free to work for whom the please, or not to work, if they so prefer.... We cannot perceive that it is criminal for men to agree together to exercise their own acknowledged rights, in such a manner as best to subserve their own interests.” Shaw CJ's judgment went as follows.|$|E

5000|$|Yet Allied Maples Group Ltd v. Simmons & Simmons 1995 1 WLR 1602 has partly {{restricted}} Chaplin v. Hicks. A solicitor's negligence deprived {{the claimant}} {{of an opportunity}} to negotiate a better bargain. The Court of Appeal held that if the client could show on the balance of probabilities that: (a) they would have sought renegotiation with the third party, and (b) {{that they had a}} substantial chance of negotiating (not necessarily that they would on balance of probabilities have negotiated) a better deal from the third party, then the court should quantify and award compensation for their loss of chance of doing so. Stuart-Smith LJ, at p1611, accepted the 'loss of chance' approach and regarded the case as one of those where [...] "the plaintiff's loss depends on the hypothetical action of a third party, either in addition to action by the plaintiff … or independently of it." [...] This inclusion of a third party in the equation to quantify loss could have been taken as a general precondition to all claim of loss cases, but Lord Nicholls in Gregg v. Scott 2005 UKHL 2 said, [...] "It is clear that Stuart-Smith LJ. did not intend this to be a precise or exhaustive statement of the circumstances where loss of a chance may constitute <b>actionable</b> <b>damage</b> and his observation has not been so understood." ...|$|E

The issue considered by the court was whether the appellant could claim in negligence for the loss of a chance of a better medical outcome. This issue had not been considered by the High Court previously, the most relevant cases being Rufo v Hosking (2004) 61 NSWLR 678 and Gavalas v Singh (2001) 3 VLR 404. Claiming for a loss of chance in a personal injury action raises questions as to recognised damage and causation, {{and the members of the}} High Court considered both of these...|$|E
5000|$|Neighbors filed {{federal and}} state {{lawsuits}} against Barrington and the USCA, {{in an attempt to}} stop heroin dealing and collect monetary damages for loss of property value under the RICO act. [...] "According to the factual allegations of plaintiffs' complaint, Barrington Hall residents collectively agreed at a house meeting to allow drug dealing at Barrington. At least nineteen different individuals within the co-operative sold drugs there, and drug sales have allegedly been going on at Barrington for over twenty years." [...] The federal suit was dismissed in 1992. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to grant a writ to consider whether to reinstate the federal lawsuit against Barrington on plaintiffs' theory that nuisance <b>damage</b> <b>actionable</b> as property <b>damage</b> under state law can, for purposes of finding a federal RICO violation, serve as the property damage necessary to such a federal action.|$|R
40|$|Just as we {{have been}} witness to a steady {{expansion}} of trademark protection, we have also been witness to the gendering of the object of that protection. Today the brand is feminine in trademark law and that gendering is instrumental to our desire to increase protection for trademarks. This gendering of the brand tracks recent changes in trademark law and this is no coincidence. The expansion of trademark protection spans a range of doctrines, but perhaps the most dramatic expansion of trademark rights has been the creation of an antidilution right. The trademark bar claimed that without this right, their valuable brands were vulnerable. They asserted that these valuable brands attract the attentions of bad actors. Their brands become prey to their advances. And when these bad actors have used their brands, they are left damaged. Given this danger, it was argued that the law should run to their aid. Promotion of this moral imperative to increase protection is important because why else would we. Dilution law radically shifts the balance in trademark law. For more than a hundred years, federal trademark law rights hinged on proof of consumer confusion. The confusion of consumers in the marketplace is a harm we can understand and are motivated to protect against. And what is the harm of dilution? According to the theory, dilution weakens the mark, which may diminish its value. How do we prove or measure impairment? We can 2 ̆ 7 t. Instead, trademark owners would like us to take it on faith that this harm will occur when someone else uses a famous mark. The interest being protected in trademark law has also shifted. Whereas the law 2 ̆ 7 s concern had been for the consumer, it is now for the brand. And the particular interest the law seeks to protect appears to be a reputational interest. Thus, the new dilution right more resembles defamation law than trademark law. But at least in defamation law, plaintiffs are required to prove an injury. Generally, under defamation law in order for the publication of a slander to be <b>actionable</b> some special <b>damage</b> must be proved to flow from it. The presumption of injury to reputation in today 2 ̆ 7 s trademark dilution law recalls the 19 th century tort of defamation of a woman 2 ̆ 7 s reputation. Under this exception to the general rules of defamation, impugning the chastity of a woman was slander per se, with no need to show damage. The arguments in favor of dilution protection for brands tracks Victorian attitudes towards women. Like trademarks today, women were thought of as property whose value was dependent on their purity. Negative associations and innuendo could alter that value. We can think of trademark distinctiveness-the quality that lends marks their special protections-as analogous to a woman 2 ̆ 7 s pedestaled status. Distinctive marks are set apart from others. Marketers admire their aesthetic appeal and play on their accessibility/inaccessability. Like the Victorian woman whose injury must be presumed because she cannot prove a loss in economic status, so is the brand today. V Secret could not prove a loss of sales, licensing fees or diminution in valuation even after Victor Mosely used a similar mark on a shop that sold sex toys. Like the Victorian woman, the harm can not be proven because the harm is not a market harm...|$|R
