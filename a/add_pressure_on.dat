50|$|The user is able {{to adjust}} {{pressure}} easily and rapidly to the exact degree needed for any given plate. One would bring the upper roll down to the plate by turning a single adjustment screw. The roll automatically reaches a perfect parallel position with the plate (blanket) surface. Then two end adjustment screws would be turned down to meet {{the top of the}} roll's bearing blocks. If the user needed to <b>add</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> one end of the roll, he could simply turn the appropriate adjustment screw. The user {{is able to}} release or reapply pressure at any time (without changing pressure adjustment) by merely raising or lowering a lever. This eliminates problems such as starting or removing paper or felts that do not run out completely from between the rolls.|$|E
50|$|Within {{hours of}} the call, there was already a quicker start than most people had predicted. Union representatives were able to lay down enough groundwork and spread the word well enough for a {{seamless}} beginning to the strike across a total of eight states. Workers began picketing, marching, and holding rallies outside their respective mills trying to gain the support of those workers not already involved with the union, along with their local communities to <b>add</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the companies by adding supporters. The majority of the mills were empty after the massive walkout on May 26 and unable to continue production. However, two Republic Steel mills in Youngstown, Ohio and the Southside of Chicago remained open, using around two hundred to three hundred workers who disapproved of the strike to keep the mills running. SWOC officials and striking steel workers targeted the mill in South Chicago with massive numbers of picketers and rallies, hoping to bring national attention and make keeping the mill open a nightmare for Republic Steel.|$|E

40|$|In {{many parts}} of the world, {{variability}} in climatic conditions is already resulting in wide ranging impacts, especially on water resources and agriculture. Climate variability is already being observed to be increasing, although there remain uncertainties about the link to climate change. However, the link to water management problems is obvious. Water is a limiting resource for development in South Africa and a change in water supply could have major implications in most sectors of the economy, especially in the agriculture sector. Factors that contribute to vulnerability in water systems in southern Africa include seasonal and inter-annual variations in rainfall, which are amplified by high run-off production and evaporation rates. Current modelling scenarios suggest that there will be significant climate change 1 impacts in South Africa (Hewitson et al. 2005). Climate change is expected to alter the present hydrological resources in southern Africa and <b>add</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the adaptability of future water resources (Schulze & Perks 2000). During the past 20 years, most of Africa has experienced extensive droughts, the last three being 1986 - 88, 1991 - 92 and 1997 - 98 (after Chenje & Johnson 1996). If the occurrence of drought became more frequent, the impact on water resources and consequently agriculture would be significant...|$|E
40|$|Water is an {{increasingly}} scarce resource requiring careful {{economic and environmental}} management. The situation is exacerbated by rapid population growth and urbanization in developing countries. New challenges call for a new approach. Different countries are faced with different problems with their water sector. Some countries have too little water, or no scope for additional supplies without massive technological and financial inputs. Others have adequate supplies, {{at least for the}} short term, but manage their reserves poorly. Some common features of the water sector in developing countries include: New resources are scarce and expensive to exploit; Management problems extend beyond local communities, but the technical basis for collective action is not well established; Municipal and industrial water requirements are increasing sharply, while demand for water to sustain food supply continues to <b>add</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> already poorly managed resources. This paper addresses three questions. The first is how have investments in water and natural resources performed in the last three decades?

The third is what actions, policies and investments would be needed to satisfy rising demands for food and water by the world’s burgeoning population...|$|E

40|$|THE {{whistleblower}} at {{the centre}} of the quashed penalty points controversy has compiled a 350 -page dossier alleging a litany of more serious offences that he believes have gone unpunished due to garda malpractice. The damning report, seen by the Sunday Independent, claims that hundreds of crimes – including sexual assaults, drug charges, public order offences and breaches of the intoxicating liquor act – have not been properly investigated by gardai. It also alleges that almost 500 driving with no insurance charges and at least 150 dangerous driving offences were not followed up by members of the force despite being recorded in the garda pulse system. The dossier, compiled by a serving garda sergeant, details offences in one garda division between 2008 and 2010 and is said to be supported with documentary evidence from the pulse system. The whistleblower alleges that hundreds of charges were initially entered into the pulse system and marked "detected" but no court summons was issued and the records were later marked "undetected". The report on garda work practices is sure to <b>add</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> Justice Minister Alan Shatter, who has been called on to launch a public inquiry into claims that gardai have cancelled thousands of penalty points given to motorists. At a press conference last week, four TDs – Clare Daly, Mick Wallace, Joan Collins and Luke Flanagan – published details of the whistleblower's allegations that 66, 000 traffic offences were quashed by senior gardai in the last four years. The examples included a number of motorists who had penalty points or fixed charge notices terminated and later went on to be involved in fatal road traffic accidents...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review is to {{summarise}} the literature that supports {{the importance of the}} food-based dietary guideline on water consumption. General recommendations for total daily water intake are between 2 and 3. 7 l for women and men, 0. 7 l for infants aged 0 - 6 months, 0. 8 l for infants aged 7 - 12 months, 1. 3 l for children aged 1 - 3 years, and 1. 7 l for children aged 4 - 8 years. Water recommendations for the elderly and people who are involved in exercise or hard physical labour may be higher and might need special consideration. Water remains one of the primary sources of fluoride, and in areas with low levels, the fluoridation of drinking water is recommended. Defluoridation of water is suggested in areas where water fluoride levels exceed 3 mg/l. There is a paucity of South African data on general fluid intake, but some evidence suggests an increase in the intake of energy-containing beverages and in the demand for bottled water, posing unique challenges relating to weight gain and diabetes incidence, and effects on the environment and chemical leaching, respectively. Water quality remains a concern. Low rainfall, declining fresh water sources and the impact of industrial activity, urbanisation, climate change, deforestation, mining and agriculture <b>add</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> water bodies. This effect on water quality could lead to water-borne illnesses and disease.
