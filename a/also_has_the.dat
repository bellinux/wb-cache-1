5|$|A galactic bar <b>also</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> {{potential}} {{to affect the}} size of the galactic habitable zone. Galactic bars are thought to grow over time, eventually reaching the corotation radius of the galaxy and perturbing the orbits of the stars located there. High-metallicity stars like our Sun, for example, located at an intermediate location between the low-metallicity galactic halo and the high-radiation galactic center, may be scattered throughout the galaxy, affecting the definition of the galactic habitable zone. It has been suggested that for this reason, it may be impossible to properly define a galactic habitable zone.|$|E
