25|$|Because of its bitter taste, lingzhi is {{traditionally}} prepared as a hot water extract product. Thinly sliced or pulverized lingzhi (either fresh or dried) {{is added to}} a pot of boiling water, the water is then reduced to <b>a</b> <b>simmer,</b> and the pot is covered; the lingzhi is then simmered for two hours. The resulting liquid is fairly bitter in taste and dark, with the more active red lingzhi more bitter than the black. The process is sometimes repeated for additional concentration. Alternatively, {{it can be used}} as an ingredient in a formula decoction or used to make an extract (in liquid, capsule, or powder form). The more active red forms of lingzhi are far too bitter to be consumed in a soup.|$|E
