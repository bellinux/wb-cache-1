Response to exercise in <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects</b> with persistent airway obstruction as defined by a postbronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC < 5 th centile lower limit of normal (LLN) remains unknown. Dyspnoea (Borg scale), exercise tolerance and ventilatory constraints on tidal volume expansion were assessed in 20 consecutive <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects</b> with persistent mild airway obstruction detected by screening (postbronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC z-score: - 2. 14 ± 0. 29; FEV 1 z-score: - 1. 02 ± 0. 64) undergoing incremental cycle cardiopulmonary exercise testing, compared with 20 healthy controls with normal spirometry matched for age, sex, body mass index and smoking history (FEV 1 /FVC z-score: - 0. 13 ± 0. 57; FEV 1 z-score: 0. 32 ± 0. 67) and with 20 symptomatic patients with COPD matched for the same characteristics (FEV 1 /FVC z-score: - 2. 36 ± 0. 51; FEV 1 z-score: - 1. 02 ± 0. 48). <b>Asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects</b> with airway obstruction had higher dyspnoea ratings than controls during incremental exercise. <b>Asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects</b> with airway obstruction had also peak oxygen consumption and peak power output that were lower than controls, and similar to those observed in patients with COPD.

The objective of this study was to determine the changes in heart rate variability (HRV) in {{patients with}} Brugada syndrome compared to <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects</b> with Brugada ECG and controls. Methods and resultsWe studied 17 patients with Brugada syndrome, 10 <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects</b> with Brugada ECG and 45 controls.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although fungal phytase is {{frequently}} {{used as an}} additive to animal feed few investigations of its allergenic property have been conducted. METHODS: Fifty-three subjects occupationally exposed to powdered phytase from Aspergillus niger were studied. Exposure data and symptoms were registered by the company physician. RESULTS: Thirty-eight subjects complained of work-related respiratory symptoms and 14 of them showed phytase-specific IgE antibodies; only one <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subject</b> revealed such antibodies. IgE antibodies were significantly more frequently found in the high-exposure group (technical centre) {{when compared with the}} low-exposure group (laboratories, experimental animal husbandry). Phytase-specific IgG antibodies were present in 19 symptomatic (50 %) and five (33 %) asymptomatic subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that powdered fungal phytase is a highly sensitizing substance whose inhalation exposure should be avoided. Hypersensitivity symptoms could be prevented by means of extensive hygienic measures and ongoing medical surveillance...|$|E
40|$|Mesial {{temporal}} lobe epilepsy (MTLE) {{is associated with}} hippocampal atrophy and hippocampal signal abnormalities. In our series of familial MTLE (FMTLE), we found {{a high proportion of}} hippocampal abnormalities. To quantify signal abnormalities in patients with FMTLE we studied 152 individuals (46 of them asymptomatic) with FMTLE. We used NIH-Image(R) for volumetry and signal quantification in coronal T 1 inversion recovery and T 2 for all cross-sections of the hippocampus. Values diverging by 2 or more SD from the control mean were considered abnormal. T 2 hippocampal signal abnormalities were found in 52 % of all individuals: 54 % of affected subjects and 48 % of <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects.</b> T 1 hippocampal signal changes were found in 34 % of all individuals: 42. 5 % of affected subjects and 15 % of <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects.</b> Analysis of the hippocampal head (first three slices) revealed T 2 abnormalities in 73 % of all individuals (74 % of affected subjects and 72 % of <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects)</b> and T 1 abnormalities in 5 9 % (67 % of affected subjects and 41 % of <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects).</b> Affected individuals had smaller volumes than controls (P < 0. 0001). There was no difference in hippocampal volumes between <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects</b> and controls, although 39 % of asymptomatic patients had hippocampal atrophy. Patients with an abnormal hippocampal signal (133 individuals) had smaller ipsilateral volume, but no linear correlation could be determined. Hippocampal signal abnormalities in FMTLE were more frequently found in the hippocampal head in both affected and asymptomatic family members, including those with normal volumes. These results indicate that subtle abnormalities leading to an abnormal hippocampal signal in FMTLE are not necessarily related to seizures and may be determined by genetic factors...|$|R

40|$|Cyclic {{oscillations}} of neutrophils, monocytes, and CD 8 -positive lymphocytes in {{a healthy}} subject We describe an <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subject</b> with cyclic variations (22 -day intervals) of neutrophils, mono-cytes, and CD 8 + lymphocytes. This case may be interpreted as an amplification of the mechanisms which regulate the production and circulation of human blood cells. Identifying this phenomenon may help interpret cases with unexplained neutro-penia. Sir, Hematopoiesis has been suggested to show a cyclic behavior under both normal and pathologic condi-tions, 1 - 3 although other studies have not confirmed such a hypothesis. 4, 5 We report a peculiar case characterized by cyclic oscillations of neutrophils, monocytes and CD 8 + lym-phocytes in an <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subject.</b> These findings suggest the existence of periodic hematopoiesis with a clinical expression intermediate between normality and the pathologic features which characterize cyclic neutropenia (CN). 6 A 21 -year old male presented with asymptomatic, intermittent neutropenia, (neutrophils 1 - 1. 2109 /L in some blood samples). During our first observation, hematologic parameters were: Hb 15. 1 g/dL; Hct 44. 3 %; MCV 86 fL; PLT 179109 /L; WBC 3. 7109 /L; neutrophils 1. 47109 /L; lymphocytes 1. 75109 /L; monocytes 0. 27109 /L; eosinophils 0. 11109 /L; basophils 0. 02109 /L; LUC 0. 12109 /L. May-Grün-wald-Giemsa stained neutrophils showed normal mor-phology. The known causes of neutropenia, 7 including anti-neutrophil antibodies, were excluded.

40|$|Multiple {{endocrine}} neoplasia type 1 is an {{autosomal dominant}} cancer syndrome character-ized by pituitary, parathyroid and enteropancreatic endocrine tumors, {{which is caused}} by germline mutations of the tumor suppressor gene MEN 1. In the case reported here, the patient had family with this disease whose germline MEN 1 mutation was undetectable by conventional sequencing analysis. Further investigations involving polymorphism analyses, gene dose assay and nucleotide sequencing identified a large germline deletion of approxi-mately 29 kilobase pairs spanning the whole MEN 1 gene. The deletion was flanked by Alu repetitive sequences, suggesting unequal homologous recombination as the deletion mecha-nism. The polymorphism linkage data suggested that an asymptomatic son of the proband did not carry the family mutation. More direct evidence was obtained by gene dose assay and deletion-specific polymerase chain reaction, which demonstrated the normal MEN 1 gene dosage {{and the absence of}} the deletion breakpoints in this <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subject</b> and thus definitely excluded the possibility of disease predisposition.

Four hundred thirty-seven consecutive patients with defecation and micturition disorders and gynecologic complaints were studied by means of defecography (120 patients), colpodefecography (17 patients). or cystocolpodefecography (300 patients). As a control group. 43 <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects</b> underwent defecographic examination. RESULTS. Thirty-five patients were found to have rectal intususception and 18. to have rectal prolapse. Anterior and posterior rectal wall folding thickness. intussuscipiens diameter. intussusceptum lumen diameter, and the ratio between the intussuscipiens diameter and the intussuscrptum lumen diameter were measured in all patients.

Both measurement of coronary calcium scores and exercise testing are well established tests for this purpose. However, {{it is not}} clear which test should be preferred as initial diagnostic test. We evaluated the prevalence of documented coronary artery disease (CAD) according to calcium scores and exercise test results. Methods <b>Asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects</b> with ST-T changes on a rest ECG were selected from the population based PREVEND cohort study and underwent measurement of calcium scores by electron beam tomography and exercise testing. With calcium scores ≥ 10 or a positive exercise test, myocardial perfusion imaging (MPS) or coronary angiography (CAG) was recommended.

Rapid-high viruses were recovered more frequently from patients with ARC/AIDS, while slow-low viruses seemed related to the asymptomatic period of infection. The replicative properties of HIV- 1 seem to affect strongly the course of disease.

40|$|Calcineurin (CaN) is a Ser/Thr protein {{phosphatase}} {{involved in}} a wide range of cellular responses to calcium mobilizing signals. Previous evidence supports the notion that calcineurin is oxidatively inhibited by mutant Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD 1) typical of familial ALS patients in vitro and in transgenic mice. We report that calcineurin activity is markedly inhibited in lymphocytes from 37 sporadic, eight familial ALS patients and an <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subject</b> carrying an SOD 1 mutation as compared to 28 healthy controls. Two other healthy subjects, heterozygous for the D 90 A mutation from a recessive pedigree, have normal calcineurin activity. Immunoreactive CaN protein, age, sex and riluzole treatment are not related to calcineurin activity in samples from patients. However, we have observed a marked increase in total protein oxidation in extracts from ALS lymphocytes, as compared to extracts from control subjects.

Up to 20 % false-positive observations were reported. Disease was diagnosed in over 10 % of examinations of healthy limbs and was missed in over 10 % of symptomatic limbs. The accuracy of pulse palpation was strongly correlated with the systolic blood pressure in the underlying artery.

It is stated that a protective rising of the shoulder girdle is present when patients with neurogenic disorders are assessed and that the elevation is absent in <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects.</b> As sensory responses are elicited in the majority of <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects</b> and as the range of motion (ROM) is often limited during neurodynamic testing, it is questionable whether the elevation of the shoulder girdle would be absent in <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects.</b> The aim of this study,vas to measure the shoulder girdle elevation force during five variants of the neural tissue provocation test for the median nerve, Thirty-five <b>asymptomatic</b> male <b>subjects</b> were assessed. A load cell was used to measure the amount of shoulder girdle elevation force and two electrogoniometers were used to measure the ROM at the elbow and wrist.

40|$|Screening of 1, 800 brains with alpha-synuclein (alphaS) {{immunohistochemistry}} revealed five {{cases with}} abundant glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) {{within the white}} matter of the brainstem. Surprisingly, retrospective clinical assessment showed {{that one of these}} subjects did not fulfil the currently recommended clinical consensus criteria for the multiple system atrophy (MSA). One of the hallmark lesions of MSA, alphaS-positive GCIs, were widespread and abundant in this atypical case that nonetheless lacked any significant neuronal loss. If the patient had met the clinical criteria for MSA, the neuropathological phenotype would have undeniably confirmed the clinically suggested diagnosis. However, lacking overt clinical signs of MSA, the neuropathological phenotype in this subject is prone to be variably denoted or overlooked. We would therefore like to advise neuropathologists to acknowledge these cases with "occult" alpha-synucleinopathy and to inform the clinicians of such a finding. Whether these cases represent a preclinical stage of MSA or simply a biological coincidence, is yet unknown. The observation of abundant GCIs in an <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subject</b> is, however, important, because even if these cases are rare in number, their occurrence challenge the current presumption, whereby simply the number of alphaS-positive GCIs mediates the neuronal dysfunction responsible for the clinical symptoms of MSA...|$|E

The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the effect of shoulder taping on the scapular kinematics of <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects.</b> METHOD: Thirteen <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects</b> performed elevations in the sagittal and scapular planes with no tape and after the application of tape. A motion tracking system and a scapula locator method were used to measure the shoulder movement.

RESULTS: Scapular taping increased the scapular external and upward rotations and posterior tilt in elevations in the sagittal plane (p< 0. 001). In the scapular plane, taping increased scapular external rotation (p< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Taping affects scapulothoracic kinematics in <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects.</b> The effect may be different for different planes of movement.

This comparative study investigates the lower extremity alignment during stance phase of gait cycle in subjects with and without patellafemoral pain syndrome. Methods: In this experimental study 14 male subjects suffering from PFPS were taken into Group A and 20 asymptomatic male subjects were taken into Group B. Video analysis of both groups were done in anterior, posterior and sagittal view. Still frames of initial contact, mid stance and terminal stance phases of the gait cycle and five angles i. e. standing foot angle, navicular angle, Q angle, A angle and rear foot angle for each of three phases were measured with image tool software. Results: The mean data showed that the standing foot angle, navicular angle, Q angle, A angle were increased in asymptomatic group when compared to the PFPS group in initial contact, mid stance and terminal stance but these increase in angles were not statistically significant. However the increase in rear foot angle in terminal stance of normal subjects compared to PFPS group was statistically significant (p value= 0. 047) Conclusion: There exists an association of lower extremity angles with PFPS. Significant difference exists with respect to rear foot angle between PFPS and asymptomatic individuals. Rear foot angle decreases during the terminal stance in the PFPS subjects when compared to <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subject...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: The Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Patella (VISA-P), {{originally}} developed in English, assesses {{the severity of}} patellar tendinopathy symptoms. To date, no French version of the questionnaire exists. Objectives: The aim of our study was to translate the VISA-P into French and verify its psychometric properties. Methods: The translation and cultural adaptation were performed according to international recommendations in 6 steps: initial translation, translation merging, back translation to the original language, use of an expert committee to reach a prefinal version, test of the prefinal version, and expert committee appraisal of a final version. Afterward, {{the psychometric properties of}} the final French version (VISA-PF) were assessed in 92 subjects, divided into 3 groups: pathological subjects (n = 28), asymptomatic subjects (n = 22), and sports-risk subjects (n = 42). Results: All members of the expert committee agreed with the final version. On a scale ranging from 0 to 100, with 100 representing an <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subject,</b> the average SD scores on the VISA-PF were 53 17 for the pathological group, 99 2 for the healthy group, and 86 14 for the sports-risk group. The test-retest reliability of the VISA-PF was excellent, with good internal consistency. Correlations between the VISA-PF and divergent validity of the Medical Outcomes Study 36 -Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF- 36) were low, and the correlation coefficient values measured between the VISA-PF scores and converged items of the SF- 36 were higher. Conclusion: The VISA-PF is understandable, valid, and suitable for French-speaking patients with patellar tendinopathy. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{mechanics}} of human mandibular function is {{described in terms of}} the associated screws. The two distinct, yet related features of jaw mechanics, involving the motion itself as well as the forces, are both functions of the anatomical constraints, namely the contact areas that exist within the temporomandibular joint, and the forces of the muscles and tendons that allow motion to occur. The relationships that exist between these two aspects of jaw-motion are identified in this paper showing that muscle forces can be uniquely represented in terms of the action screw. This new approach to analyzing {{the mechanics of}} jaw-motion also incorporates the previously studied motion screw or helical axis. A consistent dynamic model is formulated where the action screw is used to represent the action of the closing muscle forces while the moment arms of the muscle forces are determined about the motion screw representing mandibular kinematics. The action screw formulation is verified using in vivo motion data and MR image information for a single <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subject.</b> The results confirm the feasibility of the method and its application in dental research. A general increase in the mechanical advantage of most muscles, in the distance between action and motion screws {{as well as in the}} expended energy towards the end of the jaw-closing phase was observed. Asymmetries in the distribution of muscle force magnitudes appeared to influence the resultant force and moment of the action screw but had little effect on its spatial location. The method presented is intended to facilitate understanding of mandibular function and dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{is sensitive to}} early atherosclerotic changes such as positive remodeling in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). We assessed prevalence, quality, and extent of coronary atherosclerosis {{in a group of}} healthy subjects compared to patients with confirmed CAD. METHODOLOGY: Twenty-two patients with confirmed CAD (15 M, 7 F, mean age 60. 4 ± 10. 4 years) and 26 healthy subjects without history of CAD (11 M, 15 F, mean age 56. 1 ± 4. 4 years) underwent MRI of the right coronary artery (RCA) and vessel wall (MR-CVW) on a clinical 1. 5 T MR-scanner. Wall thickness measurements of both groups were compared. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Stenoses of the RCA (both < and ≥ 50 % on CAG) were present in all patients. In 21 / 22 patients, stenoses detected at MRI corresponded to stenoses detected with conventional angiography. In 19 / 26 <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects,</b> there was visible luminal narrowing in the MR luminography images. Fourteen of these subjects demonstrated corresponding increase in vessel wall thickness. In 4 / 26 <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects,</b> vessel wall thickening without luminal narrowing was present. Maximum and mean wall thicknesses in patients were significantly higher (2. 16 vs 1. 92 mm, and 1. 38 vs 1. 22 mm, both p< 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of middle-aged individuals, both patients with stable angina and angiographically proven coronary artery disease, as well as age-matched <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects.</b> exhibited coronary vessel wall thickening detectable with MR coronary vessel wall imaging. Maximum and mean wall thicknesses were significantly higher in patients. The vast majority of <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects</b> had either positive remodeling without luminal narrowing, or non-significant stenosis.

40|$|IgG avidity {{tests are}} used to {{discriminate}} acute from chronic infections. There are few reports on the IgG avidity profile of patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL). This study investigated the anti-Leishmania IgG avidity in patients with classic VL (n = 10), patients showing clinical cure after treatment (n = 18), and <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects</b> {{with at least one}} positive Leishmania test (n = 20). All subjects were from areas in Brazil where VL is endemic. Serum samples were collected from each subject on two different occasions. IgG avidity was evaluated by Western blotting. The proportion of high-avidity antibodies was higher in all samples from patients with classic VL. In contrast, low-avidity antibodies predominated in subjects with a history of VL, including 13 cases (72. 2 %) in the first assessment and 14 (77. 8 %) in the second. Fifteen (75 %) of the <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects</b> presented a predominance of low-avidity antibodies in the first assessment, and the frequency of high-avidity antibodies increased over time in seven subjects (35 %) of this group. Antibodies against the 14 - and/or 16 -kDa antigen fraction were detected in the first assessment in all patients with classic VL, in 10 (55. 5 %) treated patients, and in 10 (50 %) <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects.</b> These were high-avidity antibodies in most cases. In the asymptomatic group, an increase in IgG avidity against the 14 - and/or 16 -kDa antigen fraction was observed in three cases (15 %). The results indicate distinct responses in infected and <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects,</b> probably associated with the length of time after infection. In this respect, IgG avidity tests represent a new approach to better characterize asymptomatic VL...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the range of mandibular movements and to analyze the difference in range of mouth opening, right and left lateral movements, and protrusive movement between patients with clinical diagnoses of temporomandibular disorders and <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects</b> (control group) in a young male population. A total of 240 subjects, aged 19 – 28, were included in the study. The TMD sample comprised 180 patients (60 patients with muscle disorders; 60 patients with disc displacement with reduction; and 60 patients with muscle disorders and disc displacement with reduction) and was compared with 60 healthy control subjects. All participants were evaluated by the attending dentists at baseline by means of a physical examination of the masticatory system and a history questionnaire which included the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD) Axis I measures. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the post hoc Bonferroni criteria showed significant difference in ranges of mandibular movements between and within the groups of <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects</b> and TMD patients for active mouth opening (p = 0. 001), right lateral movement (p = 0. 002), left lateral movement (p = 0. 006), and protrusive movement (p = 0. 05). It has been found that there are statistically significant differences in the range of mandibular movements that separate <b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects</b> and patients with muscle disorders and disc displacements with reduction in this young male population. However, we cannot conclude that measurements of active mandibular movements can discriminate one group (TMD patients) from the other (<b>asymptomatic</b> <b>subjects),</b> because the mean ranges of these active movements between the groups were measured in clinically »normal« values...|$|R
