500|$|Bowdoin as {{named as}} a {{delegate}} to the First Continental Congress in 1774 but did not attend, citing the poor health of his wife. [...] A bout of poor health, probably caused by tuberculosis, at the time also affected him. [...] Bowdoin was again ill in 1775 when the American Revolutionary War broke out, and the family was relocated from British-occupied Boston (which was then under siege by area militia) first to Dorchester, and eventually to Middleborough, where he resided until 1778. [...] (Bowdoin's Beacon Street mansion was occupied by General John Burgoyne.) [...] Despite his convalescence he was kept apprised of events occurring in and around Boston, and {{was elected president of}} the executive council of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress. [...] This position, which he held until 1777, made him the de facto head of the Massachusetts government. [...] Citing his ongoing poor health, he resigned the post and withdrew from public view. [...] He continued to correspond with other revolutionaries, and enjoyed their confidence, although his absence from the war effort would lead to later political difficulties. [...] He began to return to public life in 1778, and when Massachusetts wrote its own constitution in 1779, he was president of the convention called to create it, and chairman of the committee that drafted it. [...] John Adams, also a committee member, is generally credited as the major <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> constitution, although Bowdoin and Samuel Adams likely made significant contributions.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, Jackson's {{album is}} said to exhibit a [...] "politically driven feminist" [...] message, as stated by Lilly Goren in You've Come A Long Way, Baby: Women, Politics, and Popular Culture (2009). Musically, {{according}} to Rickey Vincent, author of Funk: The Music, The People, and The Rhythm of The One (1996), Jam and Lewis's collaboration with her {{is said to}} be one of the high points of the 1980s, as they redefined dance music by mixing a youthful sound with industrial-strength beats. As documented by musicologist Richard J. Ripani, <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> Blue Music: Changes in Rhythm & Blues, 1950–1999 (2006), Control is regarded as one of the most influential albums in the history of rhythm and blues and the first album to bridge the gap between R and rap music. Its success in both the mainstream R and pop music charts [...] "led to the incorporation of many of the stylistic traits of rap over the next few years, and Janet Jackson was to continue {{to be one of the}} leaders in that development." [...] Furthermore, the album's second single [...] "Nasty" [...] has been credited with influencing the new jack swing genre, pioneered by Teddy Riley. The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004) wrote that the album impacted popular music with a [...] "blockbuster momentum all its own", while Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine noted Control [...] "was every bit the hit machine that her brother's Thriller was." [...] Steve Morse of The Boston Globe commented: [...] "All things considered, 1986 was a stellar year for the black female vocalist—the best, in fact, since the disco era of a decade back... Black music crossed over to the pop charts in dramatic fashion, with Whitney Houston, Patti LaBelle and Janet Jackson each having No. 1 albums." ...|$|E

[...] Richard J. Ripani <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>New</b> Blue Music: Changes in Rhythm & Blues, 1950–1999 (2006) noted that she had led the incorporation of rap into mainstream R with {{a select group of}} artists, in that [...] "rap music no longer sounded so musically distant to many R listeners because many of its traits were commonly heard in songs by mainstream artists such as Janet Jackson, Mary J. Blige, Keith Sweat, and others." [...] Vibe magazine observed that [...] "R was omnipresent in 1993. It was a year in which Janet Jackson, at 27, topped the Billboard pop album charts for six straight summer weeks, with her critically lauded, six-times-platinum Janet" [...] It became one of only five albums {{in the history of the}} Billboard 200—along with Whitney Houston's Whitney (1987), Norah Jones's Feels Like Home (2004), Taylor Swift's Fearless (2008), and Susan Boyle's I Dreamed a Dream (2009)—to debut at number one and remain at the top of the chart for a minimum of six consecutive weeks. It is also only one of seven albums—including Michael Jackson's Thriller (1982) and Bad (1987), Bruce Springsteen, Born in the U.S.A. (1984), George Michael's, Faith (1987), Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 (1989) and Katy Perry's, Teenage Dream (2010) to yield a minimum of six top ten hit singles on the Hot 100.|$|E

60|$|In 1709, {{when the}} {{publication}} of the Tatler began, our great-great-grandfathers must have seized upon that new and delightful paper with much such eagerness as lovers of light literature in a later day exhibited when the Waverley novels appeared, upon which the public rushed, forsaking that feeble entertainment of which the Miss Porters, the Anne of Swanseas, and worthy Mrs. Radcliffe herself, with her dreary castles and exploded old ghosts, had had pretty much the monopoly. I have looked over many of the comic books with which our ancestors amused themselves, from the novels of Swift’s coadjutrix, Mrs. Manley, the delectable <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Atlantis, to the facetious productions of Tom Durfey, and Tom Brown, and Ned Ward, writer of the London Spy and several other volumes of ribaldry.

In the excellent newspaper collection at the British Museum, you may see, besides the Craftsman and Post Boy, specimens, and queer specimens they are, of the higher literature of Queen Anne’s time. Here is an abstract from a notable journal bearing date, Wednesday, October 13th, 1708, and entitled The British Apollo; or, Curious Amusements for the Ingenious, by a Society of Gentlemen.
