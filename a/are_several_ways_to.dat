The current repertoire is heavily influenced by the taste of aristocratic class in Tokugawa period and does not necessarily reflect popularity among the commoners.

5|$|There <b>are</b> <b>several</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> {{classify}} climates into similar regimes. Originally, climes {{were defined}} in Ancient Greece {{to describe the}} weather depending upon a location's latitude. Modern climate classification methods can be broadly divided into genetic methods, which focus on the causes of climate, and empiric methods, which focus {{on the effects of}} climate. Examples of genetic classification include methods based on the relative frequency of different air mass types or locations within synoptic weather disturbances. Examples of empiric classifications include climate zones defined by plant hardiness, evapotranspiration, or more generally the Köppen climate classification which was originally designed to identify the climates associated with certain biomes. A common shortcoming of these classification schemes is that they produce distinct boundaries between the zones they define, rather than the gradual transition of climate properties more common in nature.|$|E

One way is to examine the performance of simple value strategies, such as buying low PE ratio stocks, low price-to-cash-flow ratio stocks, or low price-to-book ratio stocks. Numerous academics have published studies investigating the effects of buying value stocks. These studies have consistently found that value stocks outperform growth stocks and the market as a whole.|$|E
25|$|There <b>are</b> <b>several</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> {{construct}} new {{rings out}} of given ones. The aim of such constructions is often to improve certain {{properties of the}} ring {{so as to make}} it more readily understandable. For example, an integral domain that is integrally closed in its field of fractions is called normal. This is a desirable property, for example any normal one-dimensional ring is necessarily regular. Rendering a ring normal is known as normalization.|$|E

Depending on the problem domain some layouts may be better suited and easier to understand than others.|$|E

All three bells ring {{together}} when ringing in a knocking motion. A second way is {{to pick up the}} third bell sideways so the clapper swings outward. Ringers with good control can then ring the first bell without ringing the third, allowing him or her to play three notes in one hand.|$|E
