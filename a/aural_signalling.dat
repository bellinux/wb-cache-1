50|$|When VF and the <b>aural</b> <b>signal</b> {{modulate}} {{the same}} carrier the inevitable non-linearity {{of the electronic}} circuits cause unwanted signals which are called intermodulation products.

If the system computes that the runway is too short when wet, an amber message appears in the primary flight display.

50|$|In System B the VF {{bandwidth}} is 5 MHz. Without any suppression, {{the corresponding}} visual RF bandwidth must be 10 MHz. (Here, presence of <b>aural</b> <b>signal</b> is omitted {{for the sake}} of simplification.) But by using a VSB filter, the visual RF bandwidth is reduced to 6.25 MHz; 5 MHz in one sideband and 1.25 MHz in the other sideband. (The filter characteristic in the suppressed sideband is such that between 0 and 0.75 MHz there is no suppression.) By this method, 3.75 MHz is economised, which means that for the same band allocated for broadcasting, the number of TV services increases approximately one and half fold.|$|R

40|$|Barn owls hunt in {{the dark}} by using cues from both sight and sound to locate their prey. This task is {{facilitated}} by topographic maps of the external space formed by neurons (e. g., in the optic tectum) that respond to visual or <b>aural</b> <b>signals</b> from a specic direction. Plasticity of these maps has been studied in owls forced to wear prismatic spectacles that shift their visual eld. Adaptive behavior in young owls {{is accompanied by a}} compensating shift in the response of (mapped) neurons to auditory signals. We model the receptive elds of such neurons by linear lters that sample correlated audio{visual signals, and search for lters that maximize the gathered information, while subject to the costs of rewiring neurons. Assuming a higher delity of visual information, we nd that the corresponding receptive elds are robust and unchanged by articial shifts. The shape of the aural receptive eld, however, is controlled by correlations between sight and sound. In response to prismatic glasses, the aural receptive elds shift in the compensating direction, although their shape is modied due to the costs of rewiring. I...|$|R
50|$|The video (VF) input is a {{composite}} video signal (video information with sync) of maximum 1 volt on 75 Ω impedance. (1 V limit is for luminance signal. Some operators may accept superimposed color signals slightly over 1 V.) After buffer and 1 V clipping circuits the signal {{is applied to the}} modulator where it modulates an intermediate frequency signal (which is different from the one used for <b>aural</b> <b>signal.)</b> The modulator is an amplitude modulator which modulates the IF signal in a manner where 1 V VF corresponds to low level IF and 0 volt VF corresponds to high level IF. AM modulator produces two symmetrical side bands in the modulated signals. Thus IF band width is two times the video band width. (i.e. if the VF bandwidth is 4.2 MHz, the IF bandwidth is 8.4 MHz.) However, the modulator is followed by a special filter known as Vestigal sideband (VSB) filter. This filter is used to suppress a portion of one side band, thus bandwidth is reduced. (Since both side bands contain identical information, this suppression doesn't cause a loss in information.) Although the suppression causes phase delay problems the VSB stage also includes correction circuits to equalise the phase.|$|R
50|$|Split sound system: Actually {{there are}} two {{parallel}} transmitters one for aural and one for visual signal. The two signals are combined at the output via a high power combiner.

40|$|The {{comprehension}} of spoken language {{is based on}} th e central auditory analysis of complex acoustic signals. Many psychophysical studies have reported a direct rela tion between gradual, spectrotemporal modifications of s peech sounds and the impairment of the comprehensio n of such altered sounds. Thus, {{it is reasonable to}} a ssume that deficits in the understanding of speech seen in patients with acquired brain lesions may, to a cert ain degree, be due to the impaired central processi ng of acoustic signals. In this study we report on the de sign of psychoacoustic tests for evaluating signal processing at different levels of the central auditory system. These tests allow a differentiation between signal processing in (i) the auditory periphery, (ii) the auditory br ainstem and (iii) diencephalic or telencephalic aud itory areas. Specific care was taken to design reliable tests th at can be administered with a minimal amount of ins truction and stress to the subjects. This is of special impo rtance for the examination of patients with acquire d brain lesions who might suffer from cognitive deficits an d/or have language comprehension problems that coul d make understanding complex psychophysical test inst ructions difficult. The main body of this report provides normative dat a on age-depend- ent alterations in auditory processing gathered fro m one hundred normal-hearing subjects between 20 an d 70 years of age. Monaural pure tone thresholds were us ed to evaluate the performance of the peripheral he aring system and served {{as the basis for the}} subsequent t ests. The integrity of auditory brainstem processin g was evaluated by quantifying interaural frequency, inte nsity and duration discrimination. All the respecti ve inter- aural differences induce lateralized auditory perce ptions that are critically dependent on binaural pr ocessing. Diencephalic/ telencephalic processing was tested b y varying the same acoustic parameters (frequency, inten- sity and tone duration) as well as measuring discri mination limens for successively presented <b>signals.</b> Mon- <b>aural</b> <b>signal</b> presentation permits the measurement o f the respective processing in general, while prese nting these signals together with noise pulses to the oth er ear (i. e. dichotic signal/noise stimulation) specifically measures the contribution of the cortical hemisphere contral ateral to the side where the signals were presented. In nor- mal-hearing subjects, the difference limens of the monaural and dichotic signal/noise tests did not differ systemati- cally, while the interaural thresholds were signifi cantly lower at low frequencies. Both the pure tone threshold and all discrimination limens deteriorated with age. Taking age dependency into consideration is indis pens- able to any neurological evaluation of central audi tory performance. Data on patients with acquired le sions in the brainstem, lesions in the left or right superio r temporal plane or subcortical lesions are present ed in this report as an indication for the specificity of the tests...|$|R
50|$|In {{analogue}} broadcasting the {{composite video signal}} modulates the carrier by a type of amplitude modulation named VSB. The polarity of the modulation is negative, i.e., higher {{the level of the}} CVS, lower the level of the RF signal. If the level of CVS is 0 volt the level of the RF signal is % 100. The modulation index is so arranged that, the maximum level of CVS yields a RF level of % 10 (sometimes % 12.5). This value is known as the level of the residual carrier. If the modulation index yields more than % 10 for maximum level input (high residual carrier), the efficiency of the transmission drops, i.e., low contrast. On the other hand, if the RF level is below % 10 (low residual carrier), <b>aural</b> and visual <b>signals</b> begin to interfere each other. So {{it is important to keep}} %10 for 1000 mV input.|$|R
40|$|Background &amp; Aim: Socio-economical {{changes have}} {{increased}} the women's opportunity to take job in recent decades. The increased levels of women in work places, {{has resulted in a}} high interest in the potential adverse effects of work on pregnancy outcome. This study was conducted in order to surveying the association between occupational factors and preterm childbirth. Methods &amp; Materials: It is a cross-sectional study. Samples consisted of nurses and midwives (518 person) who working in Tehran's universities of medical sciences hospitals. Also they delivered newborns in gestational age more than twenty weeks (term or preterm) in years 2001 - 2006. The subjects were selected using a multi stage sampling method. Data gathered using a self-administered questionnaire. Occupational factors labeled as fatigue score and working hours. The relation between Occupational factors and preterm birth was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics (Chi-squared, t-test and Mann-Whitney U test) by SPSS software. Results: Based on the study findings, the prevalence of preterm labor was 17. 2 % (95 %CI= 0. 14 - 0. 20). Although the proportions of unfavorable working conditions include: working at acute clinical wards, standing up more than 3 h per each working shift, physical exercise, working in cold or hot weather, working in busy environment with continuous noise, being checker of visual and <b>aural</b> monitoring <b>signals,</b> working hours equal or more than 40 hours per week, and working fatigue score equal or more than 3 were higher in preterm group; but it didn't show any significant relation with preterm birth. Conclusion: According to the research findings, it seems that occupational factors do not have explicit effect on preterm childbirth. Therefore more investigations are recommended. &nbsp; Key words: Preterm Labor, Occupational Factors, Fatigu...|$|R

40|$|Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS), Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning Sensors (EGPWS) and Terrain Awareness Systems (TAWS) {{have been}} {{developed}} to aid in the reduction of aircraft ground collisions. They are devices which provide pilots with an <b>aural</b> warning <b>signal</b> of proximity of terrain. These systems make use of a downward looking sensor which senses the proximity of oncoming terrain. Certainly these warning devices are beneficial if the pilot reacts to them but they do not assist in improving the situation awareness of the flight crew or what action to take to avoid a collision. The implementation of such systems has reduced aircraft accidents caused by Controlled Flight into Terrain (CFIT) however it has not been eliminated. Thus it is necessary for a new system to be developed, that would not only act like a warning, but would also be capable of assisting the pilot by providing him with safe escape trajectories in a situation which could eventuate into a CAT accident. Pilots usually conduct a pull- up manoeuvre when in ground proximity to increase altitude. This is a logical response but in high mountainous terrain, this manoeuvre may still result in a collision. Furthermore, the sudden pull up manoeuvre could cause the aircraft to exceed its aerodynamics, structural and propulsion limitations. For example load factor. Hence, the primary aim of this research is to develop a methodology utilizing the availability of a three dimensional digital terrain topology database and aircraft position to compute safe escape trajectories in both vertical and lateral directions. The aircraft model used was a Phantom F 4. The objective of this thesis is to prove that flying around a terrain can provide the pilot a better chance of survival than by conducting the regular pull up manoeuvre in case there is not adequate time. To add more value to this study, two more objective functions have been added, minimum time and minimum clearance from the terrain. In the former case, the aircraft has to clear the terrain in the least possible time whilst in the latter case; the aircraft has to clear the terrain by flying close to the terrain at a specified clearance. The two scenarios have been selected as military aircraft are most often involved in Terrain Avoidance (TA) and Terrain Following (TF) operations to prevent them from being exposed to enemy fire. However emphasis is given more on avoiding collision rather than planning a collision avoidance strategy. The second part of this investigation involves a sensitivity analysis of instrument errors on the ability to fly an optimal escape trajectory. Instrumental errors are always present and should be considered in any flight simulation to determine how practical the methodology is. To investigate the extent of influence of instrumental errors, {{there is a need to}} conduct a sensitivity analysis which is presented. The sensitivity study involves consideration of various scenarios in which the aircraft is required to fly an optimal flight trajectory out of collision. The principal reason for such analysis Is to determine the sensitivity of the optimal escape trajectory solution subjected to instrument errors. Snopt and Direct software were used extensively in Matlab environment version 7 for all the analytical work conducted for this thesis. The three dimensional terrains were initially generated via using functions such as cylinders, cones, etc. Subsequently the more complicated shape of the terrains were generated in Terrain Generator which was exported and converted to Direct format file using B-Splines function in Matlab. Further details pertaining to generation of results are provided. The results obtained in this thesis show that generation of safe aircraft trajectories in a three dimensional digital terrain topology are possible. Although the equations of motion were based on three degrees of freedom, there were limitations added on the dynamics of the aircraft to make it realistic. The ability to use different terrains for modelling also proves that the method is versatile. Finally investigation of the sensitivity analysis shows the ability to counter act the errors in navigational instruments of the aircraft...|$|R
