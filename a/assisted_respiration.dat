40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{sought to}} analyze the effect of patent ductus arteriosus {{diameter}} on treatment success in premature neonates. METHODS: Among 537 consecutive neonates born between 1985 and 2005 with a diagnosed patent ductus arteriosus, 201 premature patients (< 35 weeks' gestation) treated for a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus were retrospectively reviewed. Two groups were compared: group MED (n = 154; successful treatment with indomethacin) and group FAIL (n = 47; failure of medication to reduce the patent ductus arteriosus diameter to hemodynamic insignificance). RESULTS: After unsuccessful medical treatment, 33 patients required surgical patent ductus arteriosus closure, 12 died before further possible treatment, and 2 were discharged home without clinical symptoms but with an open patent ductus arteriosus. Mean patent ductus arteriosus diameter in the FAIL group (2. 8 +/- 0. 9 mm) was significantly larger than that in the MED group (2. 4 +/- 0. 6 mm, P <. 01). <b>Assisted</b> <b>respiration</b> time (ventilation plus continuous positive airway pressure) before patent ductus arteriosus closure was longer in the FAIL group (20 days) than in the MED group (9 days, P <. 001) but was similar after patent ductus arteriosus closure. By using an index of patent ductus arteriosus diameter squared/birth weight (in square millimeters per kilogram), a cutoff value of less than 9 mm 2 /kg correctly predicts medical patent ductus arteriosus closure in 87. 5 % of patients. Values of greater than 9 mm 2 /kg correctly predict medication failure in 41. 5 % of patients. CONCLUSIONS: In preterm babies requiring surgical patent ductus arteriosus closure, longer respiration times reflect a delay while attempting medical treatment, but respiration time is equally short between groups after shunt elimination. Medical treatment, although a valid first option, is likely to fail with larger patent ductus arteriosus diameters and lower birth weights. Unwarranted <b>assisted</b> <b>respiration</b> and corresponding hospital stay might be shortened by earlier surgical referral for patent ductus arteriosus closure in preterm babies with a patent ductus arteriosus index of greater than 9 mm 2 /kg...|$|E

50|$|Anaesthetized {{patients}} lose protective airway reflexes (such as coughing), airway patency, {{and sometimes}} a regular breathing pattern due {{to the effects of}} anaesthetics, opioids, or muscle relaxants.To maintain an open airway and regulate breathing, some form of breathing tube is inserted after the patient is unconscious.To enable mechanical ventilation, an endotracheal tube is often used, although there are alternative devices that can <b>assist</b> <b>respiration,</b> such as face masks or laryngeal mask airways.Generally, full mechanical ventilation is only used if a very deep state of general anesthesia is to be induced for a major procedure, and/or with a profoundly ill or injured patient.That said, induction of general anaesthesia usually results in apnea and requires ventillation until the drugs wear off and spontaneous breathing starts.In other words, ventilation may be required for both induction and maintenance of general anesthesia or just during the induction.However, mechanical ventilation can provide ventilatory support during spontaneous breathing to ensure adequate gas exchange.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Cardiovascular {{disturbances}} {{were found}} to be a common feature of patients with the Guillian-Barre syndrome who were severely paralysed, requiring assisted ventilation. Glycosuria was noted in association with these disturbances, and in five patients investigated we found impaired glucose tolerance tests {{at the height of the}} paralysis. Catecholamine and 17 -hydroxycorticosteroid urinary excretions {{were found to}} be high in four patients investigated when the neuropathy was most severe, and in one patient plasma cortisol levels were high with loss of diurnal variation. With recovery from paralysis cardiovascular disturbances became less marked, catecholamine and 17 -hydroxycorticosteroid urinary excretions reverted to normal, glucose tolerance improved but remained abnormal in three patients during the period of observation. It is suggested that increased levels of catecholamines and cortisol contributed to the development of impaired glucose tolerance and cardiovascular disturbances.

M. pneumoniae antigens were demonstrated by immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue, indicating neuroinvasion {{as an additional}} pathogenetic mechanism in central neurologic complications of M. pneumoniae infection. 45 -year-old, previously healthy man had fever, pain in A the extremities, nasal discharge, and cough with nonpurulent sputum. He sought clinical care 1 week after onset of illness because of his deteriorating general state, including a headache and paresthesias in both hands. Bilateral basal pneumonia was diagnosed and treated with clarithromycin. During the ensuing 4 days, a rapidly ascending polyradiculoneuropathy resulted in tetraparesis, followed by facial palsy, ophthalmoplegia, and then paralysis of all cranial nerves.

40|$|Objective To {{summarize}} the clinical features and the surgical approach and techniques for microsurgical removal of brainstem cavernoma, and {{to evaluate the}} efficacy of surgical treatment of brainstem cavernoma. Methods The clinical data of 41 brainstem cavernoma patients treated by microsurgical resection from January 2003 to April 2011 were retrospectively analyzed, and they were 23 males and 18 females, aged 8 to 62 years. The clinical presentations included {{signs and symptoms of}} increased intracranial pressure, such as headache and dizziness, long-tract signs such as cranial nerve dysfunction, numbness and decrease in muscle strength, and ataxia. According {{to the site of the}} lesions, surgical approaches were selected following the principle of "the shortest distance between the incision and the lesion". Intraoperative short-latency somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) and auditory evoked potential (AEP) were monitored. Results Total resection of cavernoma was achieved in 35 patients, small residual tumor was left in 6 with giant lesions. No death occurred. Twenty-seven patients showed improvement in nerve function.

The four CPR methods included chest compression CPR (C-CPR), compression under the diaphragm CPR (D-CPR), abdominal compression CPR (A-CPR), and abdominal wall lifting and compression CPR (L-CPR). Methods　 A total of 28 healthy domestic pigs were randomly divided into four groups. The pig respiratory arrest model was reproduced by intravenous injection of suxamethonium. Instantly after respiratory arrest, one of the 4 CPR methods was performed immediately on the groups of pigs respectively. After 2 min of CPR, compression was stopped. The experimental pigs were given <b>assisted</b> <b>respiration</b> using a ventilator until autonomous respiration recovered. The tidal volume (VT) in basic status and that during resuscitation by the four respective resuscitation methods was determined, and minute ventilation (MV) was calculated. Furthermore, heart rate (HR), mean arterial blood pressure, and recovery time of autonomous respiration were compared between all the groups. Results In basic status, there was no statistical difference (P > 0. 05) in VT and MV between the four groups. Approximately 2 min after resuscitation, the VT and MV of D-CPR were {{higher than that of}} C-CPR; that of A-CPR was higher than that of D-CPR; and that of L-CPR was higher than that of A-CPR. The differences were statistically significant (P 0. 05). HR in C-CPR and D-CPR were notably lower than the basic value (P < 0. 01). Two minutes after resuscitation, mechanical ventilation was given, and HR in all the groups was close to the basic value 5 min after resuscitation. In the respiratory arrest pig model, L-CPR could provide more effective VT and MV than the other methods.

The average stay in hospital in the terminal phase in 20 patients followed {{to the time of}} their death was 6. 6 months for men and 4. 7 months for women. The total duration of the disease ranged from 11 to 45 months, with an average of 28. 7 months for men and 22. 2 months for women. Between the bulbar cervical lumbar and mixed forms of the disease at the onset there emerged no difference in average survival. One woman of 32 is still alive 10 years after the onset, and one after 2 years. The hospital staff were exposed over many months to the progressive deterioration in breathing, swallowing, posture and mobility, and emotional crises and dysarthria aggravated the problems of management Pain was a feature in one-third of the patientB. In the treatment, physiotherapy with the accent on passive movements was found helpful. Although formal occupational therapy was not accepted by half of the patients, it was important to talk to them frequently, and encourage any means of expression such as painting, writing or dictating diaries, poems or essays. The indications for gastrostomy feeding are discussed, and the problem is raised of <b>assisted</b> <b>respiration</b> in this disease. It often falls to the geriatric department to care for patients with motor neurone disease (MND) during its advanced stages. This happens because the disease is common in the older age-group, is progressively disabling, and the terminal phase may extend over a long time. The medical staff is thus faced with a patient who is suffering, often un-remittingly, who is deteriorating, and who often realizes {{that he is going to}} die. The daily confrontation and the communication difficulties consequent on the disease add to the problems of medical and nursing management, especially over a prolonged period. It was therefore thought worthwhile to delineate the medical and nursing problems of a series of such patients and to review our experience with them over the past six years, in the setting of a chronic diseases hospital.

It is crucial to know the incidence, etiology and clinical features of ARF to promote prevention strategies and to implement adequate resources {{for the management of}} this entity. During a nine month period, a collaborative prospective protocol with 98 variables was developed to assess all ARF episodes encountered in the 13 tertiary-care hospitals in Madrid, Spain (covering 4. 2 million people of over 14 years of age). ARF was considered when a sudden rise in serum creatinine concentration (SCr) to more than 177 µmol/liter was found in patients with normal renal function, or when the sudden rise (50 % or more) was observed in patients with previous mild-to-moderate chronic renal failure (SCr < 264 µmol/liter). Of the 748 cases of ARF studied, 665 episodes presented in inhabitans from the Madrid area. This gives an overall incidence of ARF of 209 cases per million population (p. m. p.; 95 % CI 195 to 223). The incidence of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) was 88 cases p. m. p. (95 % CI 79 to 97), prerenal ARF 46 p. m. p (95 % CI 40 to 52), acute-onset chronic ARF 29 p. m. p. (95 % CI 24 to 34), and obstructive ARF 23 p. m. p. (95 % CI 19 to 27). The mean age was 63 ± 17 years. The most frequent causes of ARF were ATN (45 %), prerenal (21 %), acute-onset chronic renal failure (12. 7 %) and obstructive ARF (10 %). Renal function was normal at admission in 48 % of patients who later developed ARF. Mortality (45 %) was much higher than that of the other patients admitted (5. 4 %, P < 0. 001). This real outcome correlated extremely well with the expected outcome calculated through out the severity index of ARF (SI) 0. 433 ± 0. 246 (mean ± SD). In 187 cases, mortality was attributed to underlying disease, thus corrected mortality due to ARF was 26. 7 %. Dialysis was required in 36 % of patients, and was associated with a significantly higher SI of ARF (0. 57 ± 0. 23 vs. 0. 35 ± 0. 19, P < 0. 001) and mortality (65. 9 vs. 33. 2 %, P < 0. 001). Mortality in patients hemodialyzed with biocompatible synthetic membranes (N = 50) was similar to that observed with cellulosic ones (N = 84; 66 % vs. 59. 5 %, NS). Mortality was higher in patients with coma, <b>assisted</b> <b>respiration,</b> hypotension, jaundice (all P < 0. 001) and oliguria (P < 0. 02).

40|$|Background: The main {{responsibility}} of an anesthesiologist is to safely maintain an open airway and preserve sufficient gas exchange in the lungs. This role becomes more significant when managing children {{especially those with}} difficult airways (DA). In such cases, a quick appropriate action can decrease the related mortality and morbidity. Laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is a device used in cases with difficult airways. Its placement {{is much more difficult}} in children especially those with DA. There is a greater risk of malpositioning and its insertion with routine techniques is sometimes impossible. In this article, we introduce a new method for replacement of LMA in difficult pediatric airways (DPA). Materials and Methods: In this before and after, pre and post design clinical trial, we evaluated 30 children with congenital anomalies and difficult airways who were candidates for elective eye surgery (short term). A written consent was obtained from the parents or the legal guardians of those who met the inclusion criteria. Inhalation anesthesia was induced by sevoflurane. The patients had <b>assisted</b> spontaneous <b>respiration.</b> No muscle relaxant was administered. LMA was inserted using the classic method in the anesthesia depth of BIS= 35 - 40. After 2 unsuccessful attempts according to the criteria for adequate function of LMA, we tried placing the LMA using our innovated method after meeting the primary requirements and reaching the anesthesia depth of 35 - 40. In this method, the index finger of the left hand was placed on the tongue pushing it downwards (towards the floor of the mouth) when inserting the LMA. This way, we assisted LMA passing down the pharynx resulting in its adequate positioning. Criteria for adequate function of LMA in both classic and innovated insertion methods included monitoring of easy ventilation, no resistance during exhalation, adequate chest movement, no air leakage, optimal airway pressure, optimal lung compliance, level of oxygenation of arterial blood and level of CO 2 a...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Castration {{has been}} {{performed}} since centuries for different reasons. In modern times, following {{the birth of}} opera in Italy in 1600, appeared a new men figure with single vocal parts consisting of arias and recitatives. The demand for soprano voices grew up. From {{the end of the}} 16 th to the whole 18 th century, the prepuberal castration was carried out to preserve the young male voice into adult life. Aims Our study is focused on the reconstruction of the biological profile of Gaspare Pacchierotti (1740 - 1821), {{one of the most famous}} castrato singers of modern times. His remains were exhumed for the first time in 2013. Being the first complete skeleton of a castrato singer ever studied, we tried to understand the secrets behind his sublime voice and how the castration influenced his body. Methods We made different anthropological measurements on the remains. We performed Computed Tomography (CT) analysis on all the skeleton and X-ray microtomography (MM) on some bones’ samples. We used a 64 -section scanner CT (Somatom Sensation 64, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). A Multi-modality workplace (Syngo Siemens) was used to reformat the data set in the coronal and sagittal planes. Volume rendered and surface-shaded-display three-dimensional models as well as three-dimensional animated virtual “fly-through” were created to facilitate analysis. Results Even if all the skeletal markers confirmed the advanced age at death of Pacchierotti (81 years old), the epiphyseal lines on the iliac crests were visible. Pacchierotti’s cervical vertebrae were strongly eroded with signs of osteophytic lipping in the body, because of osteoporosis and of continuous movements of head and neck during singing exercises. Another important marker found in Pacchierotti’s remains was the insertion of three important respiratory muscles on the second ribs, the scalenus posterior, which elevates the second rib, the serratus anterior, which can lift the ribs and <b>assist</b> in <b>respiration,</b> and the serratus posterior superior, that elevates second to fifth ribs and aids deep inspiration. Both scapulae had a marked infraglenoid tubercle due to a strong insertion of the long head of the triceps brachii muscle, which acts on the shoulder joint and is involved in retroversion and adduction of the arm. The CT scan pointed out a general calcareous atrophy with multiple cribrosus bones in the vertebral walls. The cervical vertebrae were strongly eroded; there was an anterior wedge-shaped vertebra (T 7), an anterior vertebral wall fracture in both L 1 and L 2 that can be due to osteoporosis; there were also several osteophytes between L 3 and L 4, and a Schmorl’s nodes in the vertebral body endplate of L 4...|$|R
40|$|Anaesthesia {{produced}} by intermittent injections of halothane into the oxygen inflow of a closed circuit {{has been described}} {{in a series of}} 136 cases. The advantages of accuracy, safety and economy have been discussed. The Comptroller and Auditor-General in his survey of the Appropriation Accounts for 1960 - 61 scrutinized the use of "a general anaesthetic" introduced in 1954. In 1960 - 61, hospital purchases of this agent amounted to more than £ 500, 000, and already in 1961 - 62 the rate of use has risen by 20 per cent (Lancet, 1962). This statement, which must refer to halothane, inevitably gives pause for thought. It can reasonably be accepted that halothane has established a place for itself in anaesthesia and a stage has been reached already when many anaesthetists would greatly dislike to do without it. Nevertheless the cost of the drug must cause concern and the use of closed-circuit anaesthesia in an effort to mitigate this disad-vantage has become very popular. The principles governing the use of halothan; in a closed circuit have been enunciated by Mushin and Galloon (1960). When basal flows are used with the vaporizer inside the circuit inefficiency of the vaporizer is a desirable safeguard, and <b>assisted</b> or controlled <b>respiration,</b> if used at all, must be carried out with great caution. Although a very large series using this system has been described by Marrett (1959), the restriction on controlled respiration makes it unpopular with many anaesthetists. When the vaporizer is outside the circuit it must be efficient and accurate, and is therefore usually expensive. On occasion it may be dangerously liable to error and indeed a case of cardiac arrest has been reported by Baxter (1960) where a calibrated vaporizer had developed a fault which led to the delivery of concentration...|$|R
