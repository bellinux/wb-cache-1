He was eventually promoted to a supervisory role. He then worked for the provincial Communist Youth League organization. In 1985, the 38-year old Liu earned an <b>alternate</b> <b>seat</b> on the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. In 1986, Liu became the Inner Mongolia party organization's director of propaganda in 1986, and by 1987, the Secretary-General of the Inner Mongolia party committee, a position in charge of coordination the execution of party policy.|$|E

5000|$|Since the 13th Party Congress in 1987, in {{the spirit}} of {{promoting}} [...] "inner-party democracy", the number of candidates up for election for both full members and alternate members have been greater than the number of available seats. At the 18th Party Congress, a total of 224 candidates stood for election for full membership for a total of 205 seats. A total of 190 candidates stood for election for a total of 171 <b>alternate</b> <b>seats.</b> This meant that 9.3% of full member candidates and 11.1% alternate member candidates were not elected. The current Central Committee has 205 members and 171 alternates and was instated at the 18th National Party Congress.|$|R
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to full membership, alternate {{membership of the}} Central Committee is more varied in its composition, and there are fewer institutional rules governing its membership list. Generally speaking, since the 1980s, alternate membership in the Central Committee is composed of officials of provincial-ministerial rank or sub-provincial (vice-minister) rank. They are selected based {{on a combination of}} experience and the institutions that they represent. Many are heads of provincial party departments or party chiefs of big cities. Prominent academics with no political experience and state-owned enterprise chief executives often hold <b>alternate</b> <b>seats</b> on the Central Committee. Some alternate members therefore hold no other political positions. Younger alternate members are also generally seen to be [...] "up-and-coming" [...] national leaders.|$|R

5000|$|First, for the {{practice}} to be successful, one should dedicate {{the practice}}, and set out {{the goal of the}} meditation session. One may decide to either practice anapanasati while seated or while walking, or to <b>alternate</b> <b>seated</b> and walking meditation. Then one may concentrate on the breath going through one's nose: the pressure in the nostrils on each inhalation, and the feeling of the breath moving along the upper lip on each exhalation. Other times practitioners are advised to attend to the breath at the tanden, a point slightly below the navel and {{beneath the surface of the}} body. Practitioners may choose to count each inhalation, [...] "1, 2, 3,..." [...] and so on, up to 10, and then begin from 1 again. Alternatively people sometimes count the exhalation, [...] "1, 2, 3,...," [...] on both the inhalation and exhalation. If the count is lost then one should start again from the beginning.|$|R

40|$|Wheelchairs {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used assistive devices for increasing personal mobility, and an estimated 1 % of the world population is currently in need of a wheelchair. Approximately 80 % of the world population currently live in developing countries and being a wheelchair rider in such context differs substantially from an industrialized context. Developing wheelchairs that can handle this rather different environment means complex trade-offs for designers. This paper presents the results of a wheelchair prototype evaluation in Indonesia. The prototype had rough terrain features and the possibility to alter the seat into two different positions while riding. The backmost position was for normal riding, while the foremost both translates the centre of gravity 100 mm forward and changed the seat angle from twelve degrees to four degrees. This was to help users to overcome inclined slopes as small hills and ramps to access buildings, facilitate transfer procedures and to provide an ergonomically more beneficial posture when sitting at a table. The study showed that primarily paraplegic users could benefit from the <b>alternating</b> <b>seat</b> functionality, but that users with polio or amputated lower limbs also could be prospect users depending on their individual preferences. However, further similar studies are needed before this technology could be fully introduced to the market...|$|R

500|$|The General Assembly building, {{housing the}} United Nations General Assembly, holds the General Assembly Hall {{which has a}} seating {{capacity}} of 1,800. At [...] long by [...] wide, {{it is the largest}} room in the complex. The Hall has two murals by the French artist Fernand Léger. At the front of the chamber, is the rostrum containing the green marble desk for the President of the General Assembly, Secretary-General and Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services and matching lectern for speakers. Behind the rostrum is the UN emblem on a gold background. Flanking the rostrum is a paneled semi-circular wall that tapers as it nears the ceiling and surrounds the front portion of the chamber. In front of the paneled walls are seating areas for guests and within the wall are windows which allow translators to watch the proceedings as they work. The ceiling of the hall is [...] high and surmounted by a shallow dome ringed by recessed light fixtures. The entrance to the hall bears an inscription from the Gulistan by Iranian poet Saadi. The General Assembly Hall was last altered in 1980 when capacity was increased to accommodate the increased membership. Each of the 192 delegations has six seats in the hall with three at a desk and three <b>alternate</b> <b>seats</b> behind them.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of cycling posture on subsequent running performance similar to the transition phase of a triathlon. Experienced, non-elite triathletes completed two trials of a cycle-run transition. During the last three minutes of a 30 minute cycling bout, at power output equal to lactate threshold, subjects either remained <b>seated</b> (<b>SEAT),</b> or <b>alternated</b> <b>seated</b> and standing cycling (30 s at a time; ALT). Heart rate, RPE, minimum and maximum knee angle, stride frequency and length, and onset and duration of quadriceps and hamstrings activity were obtained {{at the end of a}} three-minute control run and at minutes 0, 2, & 4, of running after cycling transition. Repeated Measures ANOVA (condition X minute; p = 0. 05) found control was significantly different than minute 0 for stride frequency and length, but not for minimum or maximum knee angle. EMG duration at minute 4 was less than all other time points for both quadriceps and hamstrings. Onset of muscle activity was not different for hamstring or quadriceps. Heart rate and RPE both increased over 15 minutes after transition and were higher for SEAT than ALT, however, there was no interaction (minute by position) for either variable. Results indicated changes in stride rate and length following cycling occur, but disappear within two minutes after the transition to running and do not differ between postures. Changes in duration of muscle activity may be related to changes in stride. Also HR and RPE differ between the SEAT and ALT cycling positions and over time...|$|R

The county <b>seat</b> <b>alternated</b> between Union and La Grande until it permanently came to rest at La Grande in 1905. Between 1875 and 1913, adjustments were made between Union County's borders and the borders of Baker, Umatilla, and Wallowa counties.|$|R
50|$|Heron {{was elected}} unopposed at a {{by-election}} in March 1795 as the MP for the Kirkcudbright Stewartry, filling the vacancy {{caused by the}} death of Alexander Stewart. His election {{was the result of a}} deal brokered with the support of Henry Dundas whereby he was to <b>alternate</b> the <b>seat</b> with two others. However, Heron managed to keep the seat for himself and was re-elected unopposed in 1796. At the general election in July 1802, he faced a contest from the Tory candidate Montgomery Stewart, son of the Earl of Galloway. Heron was returned, but Stewart lodged a petition, and on 10 May 1803 the result was overturned in Stewart's favour by the Committee of the House of Commons which heard the case.|$|R
50|$|The {{electorate}} {{was created}} in the Western Australia redistribution of 10 August 1955, and was named after Sir James Stirling, the 19th-century founding lieutenant governor and governor of Western Australia. Stirling covers a demographically diverse area, including several affluent beachside suburbs, as well as some more deprived areas further inland. As a result, Stirling has often been a marginal <b>seat,</b> <b>alternating</b> between the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party of Australia.|$|R

Some SP members also advocate revolutionary nonviolence or pacifism, while some consider armed struggle a possible necessity. The Party's Statement of Principles rejects equating socialism with a [...] "welfare state" [...] and calls for democratic social revolution from below. The party is strongly committed to principles of socialist feminism and strives to further embody such commitment in its organizational structure. Its national constitution requires gender parity among its national co-chairs and co-vice chairs, its national committee members and <b>alternates,</b> and <b>seated</b> members of its branch- and region-elected delegations to the Party's biennial national conventions. The Socialist Party also rejected the new healthcare reform law of 2010 approved by the Obama administration, with SP National Co-Chair Billy Wharton claiming it to be [...] "a corporate restructuring of the health insurance industry created to protect the profit margins of private insurance companies".|$|R
