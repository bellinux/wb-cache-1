5000|$|In a 1935 {{letter to}} a friend Stein stated: [...] "He writes poetry, very {{beautiful}} poetry, the sonnets of Michelangelo."Later, however, upon meeting with the artist at a gallery, Stein's attitude had apparently changed: [...] "..ah I said catching him by the lapels of his coat and shaking him.[...].'it is all right you are doing this {{to get rid of}} everything that has been too much for you all right all right go on doing it but don't go on trying to make me tell you it is poetry' and I shook him again."Stein's partner, Alice B.

60|$|But Conway Dalrymple,--though now {{and again}} he had got a side glance at her true {{character}} with clear-seeing eyes,--did <b>allow</b> <b>himself</b> to <b>be</b> <b>flattered</b> and deceived. He {{knew that she was}} foolish and ignorant, and that she often talked wonderful nonsense. He knew also that she was continually contradicting herself,--as when she would strenuously beg him to leave her, while she would continue to talk to him in a strain that prevented the possibility of his going. But, nevertheless, he <b>was</b> <b>flattered,</b> and he did believe that she loved him. As to his love for her,--he knew very well that it amounted to nothing. Now and again, perhaps twice a week, if he saw her as often, he would say something which would imply a declaration of affection. He felt that as much as that was expected from him, and that he ought not to hope to get off cheaper. And now that this little play was going on about Miss Van Siever, he did think that Mrs. Dobbs Broughton was doing her very best to overcome an unfortunate attachment. It is so gratifying to a young man's feelings to suppose that another man's wife has conceived an unfortunate attachment for him! Conway Dalrymple ought not to have been fooled by such a woman; but I fear that he was fooled by her.|$|R

60|$|The lad had a {{remarkable}} manner of standing sideways as he spoke, and thrusting his head forward over his shoulder, {{as if he}} could not get at his voice without that accompanying action. I think he would have amused one anywhere, but the child's exquisite enjoyment of his oddity, and the relief it was to find that there was something she associated with merriment in a place that appeared so unsuited to her, were quite irresistible. It was a great point too that Kit <b>himself</b> <b>was</b> <b>flattered</b> by the sensation he created, and after several efforts to preserve his gravity, burst into a loud roar, and so stood with his mouth wide open and his eyes nearly shut, laughing violently.|$|R
60|$|Buck wavered, then <b>allowed</b> <b>himself</b> to <b>be</b> drawn away. We {{passed out}} of the {{classroom}} in our order of entry.|$|R

60|$|Seeing {{that further}} appeal would <b>be</b> useless, Bligh <b>allowed</b> <b>himself</b> to <b>be</b> forced over the side. When {{in the boat}} his hands were untied.|$|R

50|$|Socrates {{addresses}} Clitophon and confronts him on {{the rumor}} of Clitophon censuring spending time with Socrates while praising time with Thrasymachus (406a1-a4). Clitophon claims that he heard incorrectly and that while he did not praise some things of Socrates, he did praise others (406a5-a7). Socrates agrees to listen to Clitophon's side {{so that he might}} learn how to better <b>himself</b> by <b>allowing</b> <b>himself</b> <b>be</b> subject to Clitophon's criticism (407a1-a5).|$|R

60|$|Aaron Sisson {{negatively}} <b>allowed</b> <b>himself</b> to <b>be</b> led off. The others {{followed in}} silence, leaving the tree to flicker the night through. The stranger stumbled {{at the open}} window-door.|$|R

60|$|Martin now <b>allowed</b> <b>himself</b> to <b>be</b> taken off. He {{had been}} hurt; {{he was the}} {{youngest}} and slightest. He was quite cool, in no passion; he even smiled, content that {{the most difficult part}} of the labour he had set <b>himself</b> <b>was</b> over.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never. His conduct {{has always}} been blameless; but every tutor has said the same--that he has no application, and <b>allows</b> <b>himself</b> to <b>be</b> surpassed by any one of {{moderate}} energy!' ...|$|R
60|$|Tears of {{gratitude}} and true repentance choked Arnulf's speech, and he <b>allowed</b> <b>himself</b> to <b>be</b> raised from the ground, {{and was forced}} to accept the support of the Duke's arm.|$|R

25|$|The siege {{was lifted}} on 16 May 1900. Baden-Powell was {{promoted}} to major general, and became a national hero. However, the British military commanders were more critical of his performance and even less impressed with his subsequent choices to again <b>allow</b> <b>himself</b> <b>be</b> besieged. Ultimately, his failure to properly scout the situation and abandonment of the soldiers, mostly Australians and Rhodesians, at the Battle of Elands River led to his being removed from action.|$|R
