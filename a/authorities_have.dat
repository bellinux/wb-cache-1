The German <b>authorities</b> <b>have</b> also argued the bust is too fragile to transport and that the legal arguments for the repatriation were insubstantial.

5|$|There {{have been}} too few {{published}} studies on the etymology of the figure of Wade's Bel (whether that refers to his milkmaid wife or to the cow) to provide a firm etymological or mythological basis. Wade is firmly rooted in Norse mythology and there are parallels between Wade's cow/milkmaid wife Bel and the milkmaid figure of Beyla in Norse mythology, who some <b>authorities</b> <b>have</b> suggested derives etymologically from baula, meaning cow. There is no published work suggesting such a link, so {{the origin of the}} figure remains unproven.|$|E

5|$|Despite safety measures, {{incidents}} {{may happen}} during the Hajj as pilgrims are trampled or ramps collapse {{under the weight}} of the many visitors. During 2015 Hajj, a stampede resulted in 769 deaths and injuries to 934 others, according to the Saudi authorities. A report from Associated Press totalled at least 1470 fatalities from official reports from other countries, making it the most deadly such episode to date. Concerns were raised in 2013 and 2014 about the spread of MERS because of mass gatherings during the Hajj. Saudi Health Minister Abdullah Al-Rabia said <b>authorities</b> <b>have</b> detected no cases of MERS among the pilgrims so far. He also said that, despite few cases of MERS, Saudi Arabia was ready for the 2014 pilgrimage.|$|E
5|$|Errors as to {{precedent}} facts, {{sometimes called}} jurisdictional facts, in Singapore administrative law are errors committed by public authorities concerning facts that must objectively exist or not exist before the <b>authorities</b> <b>have</b> {{the power to}} take actions or make decisions under legislation. If an error concerning a precedent fact is made, the statutory power has not been exercised lawfully and may be quashed by the High Court if judicial review is applied for by an aggrieved person. The willingness of the Court to review such errors of fact is {{an exception to the}} general rule that the Court only reviews errors of law.|$|E
5|$|Exclusion of {{judicial}} review has been attempted by the Parliament of Singapore to protect the exercise of executive power. Typically, this has been done though the insertion of finality or total ouster clauses into Acts of Parliament, or by wording powers conferred by Acts on decision-makers subjectively. Finality clauses are generally viewed restrictively by courts in the United Kingdom. The courts there have taken the view that such clauses are, subject to some exceptions, not effective in denying or restricting {{the extent to which}} the courts are able to exercise judicial review. In contrast, Singapore cases suggest that ouster clauses cannot prevent the High Court from exercising supervisory jurisdiction over the exercise of executive power where <b>authorities</b> <b>have</b> committed jurisdictional errors of law, but are effective against non-jurisdictional errors of law.|$|E
