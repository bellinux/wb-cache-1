500|$|In the Billboard {{magazine}} {{review of}} the album, contributor Katy Kroll wrote that Timberlake [...] "claims to be bringing 'sexy' back to pop music, and indeed he is. You can almost feel beads of sweat rolling off the title track and 'SexyBack' featuring Timbaland". Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly was complimentary towards Timbaland, producer of the song, writing that Timbaland offers [...] "tougher, trickier rhythms, minimal live playing, a plethora of hip-hop cameos, and a self-consciously hard, edgy club sensibility" [...] to [...] "SexyBack". Russell Baillie of The New Zealand Herald noted, [...] "The producer's angular synthesizer crunch is <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>it</b> [...] at best on the single 'SexyBack' where they dispense with a chorus, leaving the song sustained by its vocal fireworks, electrofunk and Timberlake's repeated declaration that 'I'm bringing sexy back. PopMatters' contributor Quentin B. Huff wrote that [...] "SexyBack" [...] was the [...] "fraternal twin" [...] to Nelly Furtado's 2006 song [...] "Promiscuous". Andrew Murfett of The Age wrote that the song was a [...] "raunchy club banger that slyly suppresses" [...] Timberlake's customary falsetto. He continues, [...] "it's introduced a new phrase into the pop cultural lexicon". Glenn Gamboa of Newsday was complimentary towards the song, writing that it was [...] "Timberlake at his best, mainstreaming {{a combination of the}} wild, edgy dance-pop style of Basement Jaxx with Missy Elliott's more experimental hip-hop to create a boldly inventive sound that still pleases the masses." ...|$|E

[...] He explains that the song expresses how he will still date her regardless of their opinions, and author Ed Morales observes that [...] "It's a calling out of the morality of Latin America. [...] It's just an invitation to turn everything upside-down by embracing the ugly and profane in life and, you know, asking people to go on that journey." [...] "Tango del Pecado" [...] also created controversy due to the repeated chanting of [...] "Súbele el volumen a la música satánica" [...] (turn up the satanic music). [...] Residente asserts that he did not add the line to create a reaction, saying, [...] "I never do something expecting something. I do things because I like them." [...] "El Avión Se Cae" [...] depicts the thoughts of a drunken airplane passenger. In [...] "Pal Norte", Residente discusses the plight of immigrants in the United States. [...] Commenting on the track's lyrical themes, he explained [...] "I had wanted to do that theme because I think it is an important topic. And not just for the immigrants in the United States but <b>all</b> <b>over.</b> <b>It</b> is a song that immigrants can identify with, Dominicans as well as Puerto Ricans.

[...] Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said that [...] "the concept of Marge’s anger at Homer got old, but this episode managed to offer a reasonably entertaining affair.

[...] Eurogamer's Kristan Reed scored it 4 out of 10, comparing it unfavorably with EA's Two Towers; [...] "EA shames Vivendi's effort for presentation and general slickness."
