5|$|In 1907, Georges Passerieu {{broke away}} from a small leading group just before Douai because he knew he couldn't outsprint them if they all {{finished}} together. He was chased {{all the way to}} Roubaix by a Belgian, Cyrille van Hauwaert, and tension in the velodrome was high. The crowd heard that Passerieu had reached the stadium but nobody rode on to the track. The leader was just about to ride in when a gendarme stepped into his path to check if his bicycle had the obligatory tax plate attached to it. Passerieu had already had <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>day</b> and a shouting match broke out before he was allowed to continue.|$|E

25|$|On July 17, 1864, {{just before}} the Battle of Peachtree Creek on July 20, 1864, Confederate President Jefferson Davis {{replaced}} General Joseph E. Johnston as commander of the Army of Tennessee defending Atlanta with the aggressive Lieutenant General, temporary General, John Bell Hood. On July 22, 1864, Hood ordered Lieutenant General Hardee to maneuver around the left flank of the Union Army east of Atlanta for a surprise attack while Major General Cheatham, then in command of Hood's former corps, {{was to make a}} diversionary attack {{on the front of the}} Union force and the cavalry commander, Major General Joseph Wheeler, would attack their supply line. The Battle of Atlanta, fought east and south of the city and near the Union supply lines further east at Decatur, Georgia, ensued. During <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>day</b> of fighting after a night march to get into position, Hardee's men succeeded in bending back the Union left flank and retaking some breastworks that had been built by the Confederates earlier. Union Major General James B. McPherson, who was killed during the battle, anticipated the Confederate maneuver against the far end of his flank, reshaped his line and sent reinforcements to the flank.|$|E

25|$|He {{was born}} in Mechelen (at that time part of the Burgundian Netherlands) into {{extremely}} humble circumstances, {{the son of a}} poor cobbler. He received his early education there but quickly transferred to Gouda, where the Brothers of the Common Life ran a famous school along monastic lines. Here Jan developed his preference for a mystical, as opposed to an intellectual, approach to religion, together with a determinedly ascetic approach to religious life. The education he received from the Brothers was a traditional Medieval one, including Grammar and Logic, conducted during long days, interrupted by religious devotions, and accompanied by frugal meals, cold beds and many punishments. However, the ancient writers were not neglected—Virgil, Ovid, Horace, Cicero and Cato were much studied with a view to producing a good Latin style and many moral messages. But he was warned against the views of these pagan authors, to counterbalance which he studied the Bible and the Church Fathers. In particular, he studied the Devotio Moderna; a mystical approach based on Thomas a Kempis's Imitation of Christ—in particular, imitation of his sufferings. Jan paid for his studies, as many poor boys did, by serving in the kitchen, or attending to richer students, and performing menial tasks, such as ringing the bell. According to the anonymous monk who was his first biographer (1519), he could not afford candles, so he read, after <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>day,</b> high up in the bell tower {{by the light of the}} moon. He never managed to develop a good Latin style—it was apparently always rough and full of mistakes—and he knew nothing of the Greek that was kindling the enthusiasm of so many of his contemporaries, but he never lost his love of the severe religious life learned at Gouda.|$|E

2500|$|The poor {{working and}} living {{conditions}} aboard the ships, {{combined with the}} heavy and often difficult workloads, led to mutinous acts aboard four ships during the war: , , , and [...] The incidents in Geraldton and Lithgow were minor and resolved without disciplinary charges, while the 'mutiny' aboard Toowoomba {{was caused by a}} lack of communication: after <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>day</b> loading supplies, the sailors did not respond to an order to assemble on the quarterdeck as they felt they had laboured enough that day, but changed their mind when informed that the order to assemble was so the captain could thank them for their efforts, and reward them with drinks. However, the Pirie mutiny was far more serious: the ship's company were unable to respect their commanding officer, who was an ineffective leader but an overly strict disciplinarian with a superiority complex. This lack of respect was compounded while repairs were made to the corvette following an air attack off Oro Bay in April 1943, when the captain forced the rest of the company to live aboard, while he took residence at a hotel. A lack of pay, mail, and shore leave contributed to the sailors' frustration, and in response, 45 junior sailors refused to report for duties on 9 May until they could present their grievances to the commander. In response, he had the ship surrounded by armed guards and disabled the main gun. A Board of Inquiry failed to identify any ringleaders, and the problem was handed back to Piries commander to solve as he saw fit: fourteen men were charged with mutiny, with ten sent to prison. Relationships between commander and company did not improve until he was replaced at the end of 1943 for his botched handling of the event.|$|E
