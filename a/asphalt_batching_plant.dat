The volumetric mobile mixer is a truck that holds sand, rock, cement, water, fiber, and some add mixtures and color {{depending on how the}} <b>batch</b> <b>plant</b> is outfitted. These trucks mix or batch the ready mix on the job site it's self. This type of truck can mix as much or as little amount of concrete as needed. The on site mixing eliminates the travel time hydration that can cause the transit mixed concrete to become unusable, These trucks are just as precise as the centralized <b>batch</b> <b>plant</b> system, since the trucks are scaled and tested using the same ASTM (American standard test method) like all other ready mix manufactures. This is a hybrid approach between centralized <b>batch</b> <b>plants</b> and traditional on-site mixing.

40|$|The {{design of}} <b>batch</b> <b>plants</b> {{necessary}} involves how equipment may be utilized, {{which means that}} plant scheduling and production must form {{an integral part of}} the design problem. The market demand for such products is usually changeable, and at the stage of conceptual design of a <b>batch</b> <b>plant,</b> it is almost impossible to obtain the precise information on the future product demand over the lifetime of the plant. This paper addresses the problem of the optimal design of <b>batch</b> <b>plants</b> with imprecise demands and proposes an alternative treatment of the imprecision by using concepts of fuzzy logic. For this purpose, we extended a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) developed in previous works, taking into account simultaneously three criteria, i. e. minimization of the investment cost, the operation cost and the total production time. The case of study is a multiproduct <b>batch</b> <b>plant</b> for the production of proteins taken from the literature. The methodology provides a set of scenarios that are helpful to the decision’s maker and constitutes a very promising framework for taken imprecision into account in new product development stage...|$|R
