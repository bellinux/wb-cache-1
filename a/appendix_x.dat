6000|$|SECTION LXII. I shall {{pursue this}} subject farther in another place; but I allude to {{it here in}} order to meet the {{objections}} of those persons who suppose the mosaics of St. Mark's, and others of the period, to be utterly barbarous as representations of religious history. Let it be granted that they are so; we are not for that reason to suppose they were ineffective in religious teaching. I have above spoken of the whole church as a great Book of Common Prayer; the mosaics were its illuminations, and the common people of the time were taught their Scripture history by means of them, more impressively perhaps, though far less fully, than ours are now by Scripture reading. They had no other Bible, and--Protestants do not often enough consider this--could have no other. We find it somewhat difficult to furnish our poor with printed Bibles; consider what the difficulty must have been when they could be given only in manuscript. The walls of the church necessarily became the poor man's Bible, and a picture was more easily read upon the walls than a chapter. Under this view, and considering them merely as the Bible pictures of a great nation in its youth, I shall finally invite the reader to examine the connection and subjects of these mosaics; but in the meantime I have to deprecate the idea of their execution being in any sense barbarous. I have conceded too much to modern prejudice, in permitting them to be rated as mere childish efforts at colored portraiture: they have characters in them of a very noble kind; nor are they by any means devoid of the remains of the science of the later Roman empire. The character of the features is almost always fine, the expression stern and quiet, and very solemn, the attitudes and draperies always majestic in the single figures, and in those of the groups which are not in violent action; [Footnote: All the effects of Byzantine art to represent violent action are inadequate, most of them ludicrously so, even when the sculptural art is in other respects far advanced. The early Gothic sculptors, on the other hand, fail in all points of refinement, but hardly ever in expression of action. This distinction is of course one of the necessary consequences of the difference in all respects between the repose of the Eastern, and activity of the Western mind, which we shall have to trace out completely in the inquiry into the nature of Gothic.] while the bright coloring and disregard of chiaroscuro cannot be regarded as imperfections, since they are the only means by which the figures could be rendered clearly intelligible in the distance and darkness of the vaulting. So far am I from considering them barbarous, that I believe of all works of religious art whatsoever, these, and such as these, have been the most effective. They stand exactly midway between the debased manufacture of wooden and waxen images which is the support of Romanist idolatry all over the world, and the great art which leads the mind away from the religious subject to the art itself. Respecting neither of these branches of human skill is there, nor can there be, any question. The manufacture of puppets, however influential on the Romanist mind of Europe, is certainly not deserving of consideration as one of the fine arts. It matters literally nothing to a Romanist what the image he worships is like. Take the vilest doll that is screwed together in a cheap toy-shop, trust it to the keeping of a large family of children, let it be beaten about the house by them till it is reduced to a shapeless block, then dress it in a satin frock and declare it to have fallen from heaven, and it will satisfactorily answer all Romanist purposes. Idolatry, [Footnote: <b>Appendix</b> <b>X,</b> [...] "Proper Sense of the word Idolatry."] it cannot be too often repeated, is no encourager of the fine arts. But, on the other hand, the highest branches of the fine arts are no encouragers either of idolatry or of religion. No picture of Leonardo's or Raphael's, no statue of Michael Angelo's, has ever been worshipped, except by accident. Carelessly regarded, and by ignorant persons, there is less to attract in them than in commoner works. Carefully regarded, and by intelligent persons, they instantly divert the mind from their subject to their art, so that admiration takes the place of devotion. I do not say that the Madonna di S. Sisto, the Madonna del Cardellino, and such others, have not had considerable religious influence on certain minds, but I say that on the mass of the people of Europe they have had none whatever, while by far the greater number of the most celebrated statues and pictures are never regarded with any other feelings than those of admiration of human beauty, or reverence for human skill. Effective religious art, therefore, has always lain, and I believe must always lie, between the two extremes--of barbarous idol-fashioning on one side, and magnificent craftsmanship on the other. It consists partly in missal-painting, and such book-illustrations as, since the invention of printing, have taken its place; partly in glass-painting; partly in rude sculpture on the outsides of buildings; partly in mosaics; and partly in the frescoes and tempera pictures which, in the fourteenth century, formed the link between this powerful, because imperfect, religious art, and the impotent perfection which succeeded it.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of the research component of this EngD, entitled Use of fan rig data for the understanding and prediction of fan broadband noise and noise changes due to a variable area nozzle As suggested by the title, fan rig noise measurements form an integral part of this thesis. The analysis of a database of rig noise measurements forms the first section of this thesis, in two parts. The first part describes the analysis of a set of fan rig noise measurements, including the variation of fan broadband and tone noise in forward and rearward arcs. The second part examines a large database of fan rig noise measurements, and attempts to derive correlations of fan broadband noise and fan performance parameters. Cluster Analysis, Principle Component Analysis, and Regression Analysis are used to understand and describe the underlying physics of broadband noise generation and the relationships between these predictors. The second section of this thesis uses a cascade broadband noise model to investigate rotorstator broadband noise. Predictions of the broadband noise from this noise model are compared to rig measurements, showing good accuracy. The underlying physics of rotorstator broadband noise generation is investigated by performing two parametric studies using the broadband noise model. The first parametric study investigates the effect on broadband noise of simple flow and geometric parameters, namely number of vanes, vane chord, vane stagger angle, and rotor wake turbulence intensity, turbulent length scale, and flow Mach number onto the cascade. These results are used to derive scaling power laws for the prediction of changes in broadband noise due to changes in these parameters. The second parametric study expands upon this by investigating the effect on broadband noise of the fan design parameters shaft speed, pressure ratio, and efficiency, at approach, cutback and cruise conditions. The variation in broadband noise due to these design parameters is explained by considering the underlying flow and geometric parameters such as number of vanes and Mach number, and the scaling power laws based on these simple parameters are used to predict the change in broadband noise between different performance points. The final section of this thesis investigates the effect of varying exhaust nozzle area on total engine noise. A new method is presented that allows the transfer of changes in fan rig noise to Eugene P. Deane EngD Thesis September 2009 2 engine noise predictions, to estimate the change in fan noise due to the pressure ratio changes brought about by a variable area nozzle. Changes in engine noise are investigated for approach, cutback, and sideline conditions, and the application of the new method assessed. As the research displayed in this thesis is closely linked to industry, the foundation of work presented in several chapters is dependent on data or figures that are commercially sensitive. It has therefore been necessary to create a confidential appendix (<b>Appendix</b> <b>X)</b> to include these commercially sensitive items. These additional results and figures in <b>Appendix</b> <b>X</b> are supplementary in nature, and sufficient results are presented in the public thesis to illustrate the results of the various chapters.

40|$|For use in risk-based {{corrective}} action (RBCA) analyses, simple analytical fate-and-transport models {{can provide a}} cost-effective means of estimating exposure concentrations and developing risk-based soil and groundwater remediation standards. Under ASTM E- 1739 "Standard Guide for Risk-Based Corrective Action Applied at Petroleum Release Sites, " such models are recommended as a conservative first step under Tiers 1 and 2 of the site evaluation process, prior to use of more complex numerical modeling methods under Tier 3. However, the reliability of an analytical model as a conservative predictor of chronic exposure levels depends upon proper characterization of key physical and chemical parameters. This paper reviews a system of analytical fate-and-transport models compiled expressly for use with the ASTM RBCA Standard and provides practical guidelines for measurement and/or estimation of key input parameters for each model. Contaminant transport pathways addressed in this paper include soil-to-air volatilization, soil-to-groundwater leaching, lateral air transport, and lateral groundwater transport. Parameter selection guidelines discussed in this paper relate specifically to the analytical expressions listed in <b>Appendix</b> <b>X.</b> 2 of ASTM E- 1739.

The organism in these enviroment {{are in a}} virtual machine with special chemistries. Two key-features {{are found to be}} very robust under mutations: Non-direct addressing and separation of instruction and argument. In contrast, the x 86 instruction set is very brittle under mutations, thus not able to achieve evolution directly. However, by making use of a special meta-language, these two key-features can be realized in a x 86 system. This meta-language and its implementation is presented in chapter 2. First experiments show very promising behaviour of the population. A statistically analyse of these population is done in chapter 3. One key-result has been found by comparison of the robustness of x 86 instruction set and the meta-language: A statistical analyse of mutation densities shows that the meta-language is much more robust under mutations than the x 86 instruction set.

We found that perceptions towards out-groups were not based on religion, ethnicity, class, or location as in traditional individual-focused social networks. Patterns of perception towards out-groups seemed to be rooted in homogeneous social sub-groups with combinations of these factors. This research project used a 192 -item survey of two hundred Iraqi business owners and managers in Iraq and in the Netherlands. It measured homogeneity of social group memberships. Survey elements included items drawn from the World Values Surveys (Inglehart), the Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey (Roper Center), and the Social Capital Inventory (Narayan and Cassidy). Homogeneity, relationship segregation, social trust, and community influence in social networks were estimated through indices reflecting components of social relationships in priority in-groups emerging from factor analysis of survey responses. Other indices included civic participation (socialization), perceptions of threat from out-groups, ethnic and religious identity, social trust, personal security, and contribution to community-based resources. Uniformity of responses to certain items about out-groups corresponded to findings by other authors on segregation and membership in social networks (Burt 1997, Buskins 2005, Inglehart 2004, Narayan and Cassidy 2001, Putnam 1995).

40|$|Cured In-Place Pipe (CIPP) is a {{well-established}} method used for rehabilitation of underground pipelines. Within North America, CIPP liners used for rehabilitation of gravity pipelines are typically designed {{according to the}} design methodology provided in the non-mandatory <b>Appendix</b> (<b>X</b> 1) of ASTM F 1216. In the design equations provided in the standard, there are two parameters, liner long-term time-corrected modulus of elasticity and long-term time-corrected flexural strength, which {{are related to the}} CIPP long-term creep behavior. However, ASTM F 1216 does not specify any methodology for characterizing the material long-term physical properties. Common industry practice has been to adopt a creep retention factor of 0. 5 for all CIPP materials. With all the new CIPP product varieties that have entered the gravity pipeline renovation market since Insituform’s patent expiry, a creep retention factor of 0. 5 may not apply. This thesis provides a comparison between the ASTM D 2990 methodology used for the prediction of 50 -year physical properties for four CIPP resins used within the City of Toronto sewers and reported in the CATT Report (2005) and the hydrostatic buckling test methodology used for long-term behavior characterization of various lining systems reported in TTC Report 302 (1994). Based on the comparison of reported results, ASTM D 2990 test procedures is recommended and used for characterizing the long-term mechanical properties of nine different reinforced CIPP products used for pressure pipe. Short-term tensile and flexural properties of the nine CIPP liners are also studied. CIPP liners are typically tested for a period of 10, 000 hours to evaluate the liner long-term behavior. In this thesis, long-term test analyses conducted for CIPP products used within the City of Toronto sewers based on 10, 000 hours (about 1. 2 years) and 96, 000 hours (about 11 years) of test data are also compared. The results of this research provide a better understanding of CIPP liners short-term and long-term mechanical properties. This work also demonstrates the importance of proper and consistent interpretation of long-term test results...|$|E

Co-creating drama can best be described as the coming together of teacher and students in a creative enterprise. The experience centres on the notion of the teacher as a co-artist, whereby they enliven qualities of creativity such as a “willingness to play, experiment, be a partner with learners, and to take risks” (Craft 1997, p 89). Co-creating is distinguished by the autonomous behaviour of the students and the artistic act of creating something of value to the group. It resonates distinctly within the theoretical frame of constructivism, as well as with more current inquiries of collaborative and creative drama practices. Classroom drama in an Irish context remains largely under-researched. It is argued that the knowledge base for teacher education should come from the teachers’ experiences in the classroom, but there has yet to be an in-depth study of teachers’ lived experiences of drama education in Ireland. In order to address this, a phenomenological inquiry was conducted into the experiences of teachers cocreating drama, with a view to gaining an in-depth understanding of the experience as perceived by them. Through a series of interventions and interviews, the teachers’ experiences and reflections were explored in order to portray the essence of the phenomenon. The analysis of the interviews has led to a multi-faceted understanding of co-creating drama. Three main themes emerged. The teachers discuss the practical implications of navigating the co-creating experience, the importance of teacher commitment, and the outcomes of co-creating drama. N...|$|R

40|$|This is {{the first}} {{comprehensive}} study to be undertaken on art made in the political prisons of the French Revolution between 1793 and 1795. Using a flexible definition of ‘the artist’ to encompass the wide spectrum of artistic producers in the eighteenth century, this research demonstrates that the imprisonment of artists took place on a much greater scale than has ever been realised. Hundreds {{of works of art}} were produced in political prisons and a significant proportion of these were sold and exchanged. Many have survived, but until now no framework has existed for their interpretation. This thesis examines a cross-sample of prison-made imagery, reconstructing the context of individual paintings, drawings and sculptures to propose possible meanings and functions of a unique oeuvre that has long been enigmatic to scholars. It demonstrates how and why works of art were made in prison and examines the circumstances of their exchange. Importantly, it offers detailed evidence to show how new functions for art evolved in response to changing political circumstances, as they affected both prisons and the people inside them. The new political prison system created in France during 1793, {{in the midst of a}} national crisis, is a poorly-understood phenomenon today, but it was also poorly understood by the people who entered and experienced it. Images offered one means of describing the nature and meaning of these new institutions for the people who were confined in them. This study harnesses an important and under-utilised body of prison-made images to shed light on the political prison as an institutional setting for the production and consumption of works of art. Broadly chronological in structure, this investigation into the art of the French revolutionary prison consists of a series of closely contextualised readings of individual works of art, aimed at recovering the original meaning that these images had for incarcerated communities at specific junctures in the Terror and the Thermidorian Reaction. Underpinning this analysis are two discrete empirical studies contained in volume II, a ‘political dictionary of artists in the French Revolution’ (<b>Appendix</b> <b>X)</b> and an ‘annotated catalogue of prison-made works of art’ (Appendix XI). These documents bring together, in a usable format, the totality of archival evidence and prison-made works of art discovered in the course of the present survey. They are accompanied by a set of analytical tables, designed to yield accurate data for some of the central questions that this study has posed, and to provide a foundation for further research on this critical facet of French revolutionary art...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{digitisation}} {{has been}} led by supply rather than demand. While end users {{are seen as}} a priority they are not directly consulted about which collections they would like to have made available digitally or why. This can be seen {{in a wide range of}} policy documents throughout the cultural heritage sector, where users are positioned as central but where their preferences are assumed rather than solicited. Post-digitisation consultation with end users isequally rare. How are we to know that digitisation is serving the needs of the Higher Education community and is sustainable in the long-term? The 'Digitisation in Special Collections: mapping, assessment and prioritisation' (DiSCmap) project, funded by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) and the Research Information Network (RIN), aimed to:- Identify priority collections for potential digitisation housed within UK Higher Education's libraries, archives and museums as well as faculties and departments. - Assess users' needs and demand for Special Collections to be digitised across all disciplines. - Produce a synthesis of available knowledge about users' needs with regard to usability and format of digitised resources. - Provide recommendations for a strategic approach to digitisation within the wider context and activity of leading players both in the public and commercial sector. The project was carried out jointly by the Centre for Digital Library Research (CDLR) and the Centre for Research in Library and Information Management (CERLIM) and has taken a collaborative approach to the creation of a user-driven digitisation prioritisation framework, encouraging participation and collective engagement between communities. Between September 2008 and March 2009 the DiSCmap project team asked over 1, 000 users, including intermediaries (vocational users who take care of collections) and end users (university teachers, researchers and students) a variety of questions about which physical and digital Special Collections they make use of and what criteria they feel must be considered when selecting materials for digitisation. This was achieved through workshops, interviews and two online questionnaires. Although the data gathered from these activities has the limitation of reflecting only a partial view on priorities for digitisation - the view expressed by those institutions who volunteered to take part in the study - DiSCmap was able to develop:- a 'long list' of 945 collections nominated for digitisation both by intermediaries andend-users from 70 HE institutions (see p. 21);- a framework of user-driven prioritisation criteria which could be used to inform current and future digitisation priorities; (see p. 45) - a set of 'short lists' of collections which exemplify the application of user-driven criteria from the prioritisation framework to the long list (see <b>Appendix</b> <b>X)</b> :o Collections nominated more than once by various groups of users. o Collections related to a specific policy framework, eg HEFCE's strategically important and vulnerable subjects for Mathematics, Chemistry and Physics. o Collections on specific thematic clusters. o Collections with highest number of reasons for digitisation...|$|E
40|$|With advancements in {{information}} technology, people can now access {{enormous amounts of}} information with ease. The education system, which plays {{a vital role in}} developing our future, has undergone important changes. In the past decades, nearly every part of the education process, from curricula design, assessment methodologies, to teaching methodologies, have been scrutinized. As a result, a series of reforms or changes have been implemented. The purposes of the present study are to investigate more about perceptions and attitudes of secondary school mathematics teachers towards the use of computers in their teaching. Besides, the factors affecting teachers’ attitudes towards computer application in teaching are also analyzed. Finally, the study will also explore the effectiveness of students’ learning through cooperative learning One class of 36 students from 5 C, aged 14 - 16, were invited to participate in this research by using the DMS of GeoGebra for teaching the topics of ‘Basic Properties of Circles’. The teaching outcome of 5 C would then be compared with 2 other classes of 5 A and 5 B, which would be taught by my peer teachers. 5 A and 5 B’s teachers would employ conventional teaching methods to teach ‘Basic Properties of Circles’ (i. e. the Control Group). Five student worksheets for Basic Operation of GeoGebra and each sub-topic of “Basic Properties of Circles” were devised (see Appendices I to V). Those 5 students were all asked to fill in the questionnaire I. Besides, 12 mathematics teachers were asked to fill in the questionnaire I (see Appendix VIII) of Mathematics with Technology Perceptions Survey (MTPS) in order to investigate their perceptions of using information technology (IT) in teaching mathematics. The purpose of the MTPS items was to ascertain the prevalence of key attitudes and perceptions creating barriers or enabling teachers’ intentions to alter their practice and to teach mathematics with technology. Demographic data of MTPS items were collected on gender, age group, years of teaching, education level, teacher training, teaching level and subject taught. During the whole study, video-recording was taken. In addition, my two peer teachers from classes 5 A and 5 B were also invited to have an interview. Then, they were asked to fill in the questionnaire II (see Appendix XIII) in order to investigate their’ intention in using the DMS of GeoGebra for teaching and learning mathematics in Secondary 5 classes. Besides, 14 students were randomly selected in order to find out the effects of their learning by using DMS of GeoGebra through peer groups, and these 14 students were invited to complete an extended version of questionnaire II (see <b>Appendix</b> <b>X).</b> Finally, students were asked to conduct a test (see Appendix VI) in order to compare the learning outcome of students learning ‘Basic Properties of Circles’ with the DMS of GeoGebra with those learning in its absence. It is suggested that the integration of computer in learning mathematics should be required. Schools need to make full use of technology to guide students {{to learn as much as}} possible. Also, leadership needs to be available to teachers and to provide an in-service education in technology use, so that technology use was operating as well as possible. published_or_final_versionEducationMasterMaster of Educatio...|$|E
