40|$|During the {{operation}} of hydrodynamically lubricated devices a fully formulated lubricant {{has the ability to}} form layers at the surfaces. A friction modifier's task is to adjust the interaction between lubricant and the surface so that friction is lowered. An antiwear additive creates a protective layer on the surface and this definitely influence the performance of the lubricated device. To gain fundamental understanding, models that address the modified liquid - solid interaction due to the formation of layers, but also models that may be used to study the effects of layers already formed on the contacting surfaces are required. In this paper, two non-Newtonian lubricant rheology models that may be used to simulate reacted layers resembling those created by lubricant additives are adopted for the simulation of the piston ring - <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> lubrication problem. The possibility of layer to layer interaction, which is likely to occur in the convex conjunction between the ring and the liner, is considered and this extends the models found in the literature. The effects induced by this type of layering are studied by using a modified Reynolds' equation where the coefficients have been corrected with factors that accounts for the layer properties. This enables, effectively, studies of layers resembling those created by lubricant additives during {{the operation}} of the lubricated conjunction between a piston ring and <b>a</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner.</b> Godkänd; 2009; 20091201 (almqvist...|$|R

40|$|Spray/wall {{interactions}} significantly influence air/fuel {{mixing and}} emissions in modern spark-ignited, direct injection engines. Yet, the complex phenomena are hardly understood - especially not {{with respect to}} the large number of parameters and the associated wide ranges occuring in an engine. Modelling spray/wall interactions thus presents a major drawback in numerical simulations done in engine development. This thesis focuses on the impact of dense, high-pressure hollow cone sprays for which existing wall interaction models are evaluated in detail and shown to fail. To the best of the author's knowledge no model adapted to the considered spray type was available which was furthermore accompanied by a severe lack of quantitative experimental data. Therefore, Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA) is used to gather data on the normal impact of an isooctane spray with 50 bar injection pressure on a hemispherical copper target. The latter can be heated and wall temperatures up to 200 °C are studied. Moreover, an additional oil film can be applied on the surface to simulate the oil film on <b>a</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> lubricating the piston motion. Variations in the particle Reynolds number between 2000 and 3000 on impact are achieved in changing the distance between injector and target. As the question how PDA data concerning spray/wall interaction have to be evaluated has not been studied thoroughly yet, a fundamental analysis was carried out and is presented in this thesis. The results are not limited to dense and high-pressure, hollow cone sprays but may serve as general guidelines for future data evaluation. Based on the measurements, the impact mechanisms of dense, high-pressure sprays are discussed where film fluctuations leading to ligament breakup are found to be decisive. For the considered high Reynolds numbers, inertial forces dominate all other forces which results in negligible parameter influence of the mean Reynolds number and the wall temperature. The oil film is observed to be quickly removed by the impacting spray which points out that spray/wall interactions on <b>a</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> may seriously endanger the operability of an engine. Finally, empirical correlations describing the secondary spray on wall interaction are developed from the gathered data and an extrapolation to oblique impact is proposed. This first empirical model adapted to dense, high-pressure hollow cone sprays is implemented in numerical code in a Lagrangian approach. Details of the implementation are given. The model is validated in several cases for impact angles between 30 ° and 90 ° measured relative to the wall and for injection pressures of 50 bar and 200 bar with very good results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Many {{simulations}} {{already exist}} {{to model the}} piston ring–cylinder liner contact; however, very few models {{have been used to}} investigate the optimum surface texture. An axi-symmetric, time-dependent two-dimensional semi-deterministic texture-roughness model of the piston ring to <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> contact with periodic boundary conditions and mass preserving global cavitation has been developed. The <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> texture, generated by honing, was con-sidered deterministically on the global scale, after an investigation comparing deterministic and homogenized solutions. The surface texture of <b>a</b> real <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> was measured with white light interferometry and an algorithm developed to generate an artificial periodic texture representative of the real sur-face. The effect of <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> plateau roughness has been incorporated on the local scale by homogenization of the Reynolds equation and calculation of flow factors from real surface topog-raphy. Using the homogenization technique to incorporate the effect of surface roughness leads to a more efficient solution than mesh refinement of the deterministic problem as the roughness {{does not need to be}} resolved on the global solution domain, allowing for significantly less degrees of freedom in the global problem. The lubricant boundary pressures have been calculated using results from a numerical ring-pack model and the lubricant viscosity has been adjusted based on the <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> wall temperature. It was found from the result of a comparison between deterministic and homogenized solutions that surface texture should be modelled on the global and not on the averaged roughness scale as is the case with many previous investigations...|$|R
50|$|Lubrication of {{piston rings}} is {{difficult}} {{and has been a}} driving force to improvements in the quality of motor oil. The oil must survive high temperatures and harsh conditions with a high-speed sliding contact. Lubrication is particularly difficult as the rings have an oscillating motion rather than continuous rotation, as for a bearing journal. At the limits of piston movement, the ring stops and reverses direction. This disrupts the normal oil wedge effect of a hydrodynamic bearing, leading to pronounced wear and the formation of a 'step' in the cylinder bore around the height of the upper ring. Noting that some sleeve valve engines suffered far less from such wear, complex designs such as <b>a</b> rotating <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> have been considered, just to address this problem.|$|R
40|$|To {{describe}} and predict wear in a tribosystem, theoretical wear formulas and empirical models exist. Most {{of the existing}} formulations have a short range of validity and can only be applied for a specific contact situation. In this paper, {{the aim is to}} investigate a specific technical application of a tribocontact in an internal combustion engine. In particular, the contact between a piston skirt and <b>a</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner</b> is experimentally simulated using a linear reciprocating tribometer and original engine parts, under close-to-reality loading conditions. The experimental findings will be analysed with a wear model that is most applicable to the actual tribosystem. This wear model, which is based on a combination of energy theories and a molecular mechanics approach, will be extended in the paper in order to add surface topography relevant parameters. The modified wear model is capable of combining the prediction of wear volume loss with the theory of fatigue and can be applied to any kind of tribosystems suffering damage due to reciprocating relative motion. For comparison with classical wear models, an empiri-cal power law – including Archard as a special case – is shown. Using the measurement results of the tribometer, the parameters that are specific to the aforementioned wear model are determined. Further-more, the applicability of the used model to describe the wear processes in this specific tribosystem will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} paper {{deals with}} the development process and initial measurement results of an opposed-piston combustion engine for application in a Free-Piston Linear Generator (FPLG). The FPLG, which is being developed at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), is an innovative internal combustion engine for a fuel based electrical power supply. With its arrangement, the pistons freely oscillate between the compression chamber of the combustion unit and a gas spring with no mechanical coupling like a crank shaft. Linear alternators convert the kinetic energy of the moving piston into electric energy.

With the high variability of the free piston concept, a strategy for a dual combustion mode operation with spark ignition and HCCI is developed.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{concept and}} design of a four-stroke 4 -cylinder internal combustion engine consisted of a single connecting rod to a crankshaft and four additional rods joining pistons with a rocker. The rocker is a specific element in the engine construction that makes this engine different from the typical reciprocating internal combustion piston engine. Furthermore, kinematical analysis of this piston- rocker- crankshaft mechanism was conducted. As concluded from the analysis, this mechanism implemented to the engine, provides several advantages with respect to both dynamic and thermodynamic related issues. First of all, {{a profile of the}} piston motion can be easily changed with change in the mechanism geometry e. g. major dimensions of connecting rods, the rocker etc. Thus, the piston motion profile can be asymmetrical with slow motion to and relatively fast distancing from the TDC. This feature can be useful in reducing thermal losses to an engine cooling system. Additionally, the mechanism characterizes itself with low transverse force from the piston, which acts on <b>a</b> <b>cylinder</b> <b>liner.</b> <b>As</b> a result, it significantly reduces frictional losses and should increase the overall efficiency of the engine. Among disadvantages, higher inertial forces are the most important problem. As analyzed, the rocker is the main component that contributes to increase in inertial forces by approximately three to four times. On the other hand, total inertia forces, due to specific kinematical chain of the mechanism, can be remarkably reduced in case the mechanism is correctly optimized...|$|R
