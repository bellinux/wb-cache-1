25|$|Salinas de Gortari {{reportedly}} grew {{angry with}} these publications and pressured Unomásuno to pay hefty fines.

25|$|Capello {{was signed}} by Paolo Mazza, the President of SPAL, for the fee of two million lire despite {{interest}} from Milan. In his second season in the youth team, he helped the club win the Italian Youth Championship and made his first-team debut against Sampdoria on 29 March 1964. A talented and tactically intelligent holding midfielder, with a good positional sense, he could read the play well and was strong both {{in the air and}} in the tackle, in spite of his lack of notable height and unorthodox physique; he usually operated as a deep-lying playmaker in midfield, however, due to his outstanding technique and vision, which enabled him to orchestrate his team's attacking moves or create chances for teammates, and was an excellent passer of the ball with both feet. Going forward he was also equally effective, and possessed an eye for goal from midfield, due to his powerful and accurate shot, as well as his ability at penalty kicks, but he lacked pace, and was notorious for not being particularly hard-working. With SPAL, he made four appearances for a struggling side that was relegated from Serie A. After returning to the top division at the first attempt, Capello became a key player in the 1965–66 season, taking penalties <b>and</b> <b>helping</b> <b>them</b> avoid a swift return to Serie B. He was also called up to the Italian under-23 side alongside teammate Edoardo Reja despite still being a teenager. However, injury to his left knee restricted him to just 16 appearances the following season.|$|E
