This paper surveys the trends in asylum seeking since the 1980 s and the literature that it has generated and it provides new regression estimates of the determinants of asylum applications up to the present.

500|$|The {{publication}} of James Edward Austen-Leigh's A Memoir of Jane Austen in 1869 introduced Austen {{to a wider}} public as [...] "dear aunt Jane", the respectable maiden aunt. Publication of the Memoir spurred the reissue of Austen's novels – the first popular editions were released in 1883 and fancy illustrated editions and collectors' sets quickly followed. Author and critic Leslie Stephen described the popular mania that started to develop for Austen in the 1880s as [...] "Austenolatry". In 1878, the French critic Léon Boucher published the essay Le Roman Classique en Angleterre, where he called Austen a [...] "genius", {{which was the first}} time that epithet had been used in France to describe Austen. The first proper translation of Austen into French that was completely faithful to the original occurred in 1899 when Félix Fénéon translated Northanger Abbey into French as Catherine Moreland. Around the start of the 20th century, members of the literary elite reacted against the popularisation of Austen. They referred to themselves as Janeites in order to distinguish themselves from the masses who did not properly understand her works. For example, Henry James responded negatively to what he described as [...] "a beguiled infatuation" [...] with Austen, <b>a</b> <b>rising</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> public interest that exceeded Austen's [...] "intrinsic merit and interest". The American literary critic A. Walton Litz noted that the [...] "anti-Janites" [...] in the 19th and 20th centuries comprise a formidable literary squad of Mark Twain, Henry James, Charlotte Bronte, D.H. Lawrence and Kingsley Amis, but in [...] "every case the adverse judgement merely reveals the special limitations or eccentricities of the critic, leaving Jane Austen relativity untouched".|$|E

Arthur's salary was initially $6,500, but senior customs employees were compensated additionally by the [...] "moiety" [...] system, which awarded them {{a percentage of the}} cargoes seized and fines levied on importers who attempted to evade the tariff. [...] In total, his income came to more than $50,000—more than the president's salary, and more than enough for him to enjoy fashionable clothes and a lavish lifestyle. Among those who dealt with the Custom House, Arthur was one of the era's more popular collectors. [...] He got along with his subordinates and, since Murphy had already filled the staff with Conkling's adherents, he had few occasions to fire anyone. [...] He was also popular within the Republican party as he efficiently collected campaign assessments from the staff and placed party leaders' friends in jobs as positions became available. Arthur had a better reputation than Murphy, but reformers still criticized the patronage structure and the moiety system as corrupt. <b>A</b> <b>rising</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> reform within the party caused Arthur to rename the financial extractions from employees as [...] "voluntary contributions" [...] in 1872, but the concept remained, and the party reaped the benefit of controlling government jobs. In that year, reform-minded Republicans formed the Liberal Republican party and voted against Grant, but he was re-elected in spite of their opposition. Nevertheless, the movement for civil service reform continued to chip away at Conkling's patronage machine; in 1874 Custom House employees were found to have improperly assessed fines against an importing company as a way to increase their own incomes, and Congress reacted, repealing the moiety system and putting the staff, including Arthur, on regular salaries. As a result, his income dropped to $12,000 a year—more than his nominal boss, the Secretary of the Treasury, but far less than what he had previously received.|$|E

40|$|The {{earliest}} Jewish {{literary works}} in Hungary were late-medieval religious writings in Hebrew, and literary {{contributions in the}} Hungarian language only began to appear {{toward the middle of}} the 19 th century. The first generation of Hungarian-Jewish writers firmly believed in the viability of a dual Hungarian and Jewish identity and in the prospects of Jewish and Hungarian coexistence, and these two concerns have remained central to Hungarian-Jewish literature ever since. Jewish emancipation was warmly supported by the intellectual and political elite of Hungary, and Jewish Hungarians gained full civil rights in 1867. However, to their bitter disappointment, they were soon facing <b>a</b> rapidly <b>rising</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> anti-Semitism that ultimately led to the Hungarian Holocaust, in which over half a million Jewish Hungarians perished. Some Hungarian-Jewish writers responded to the <b>rising</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> anti-Semitism with <b>a</b> classical dual identity position that censured assimilation involving a denial of Jewish identity, others responded by attempting to deliberately shed their own Jewish identities through conversion to Christianity or by becoming Communists, a handful of others by opting for Zionism, and in one controversial instance, by advocating the adoption of an ethno-national minority identity. After the Holocaust, many among the remnant Jewish Hungarians believed that Communism would help resolve the core existential questions facing them, but the studious silence of the totalitarian regime about the Holocaust merely left these sores festering in an unresolved limbo for decades. Curiously, the regime eventually did permit the publication of Fateless by Kertész, undoubtedly because of its anti-Nazi message, and quite missing the irony that its resolute anti-totalitarianism applied equally to them. During the 75 years between Emancipation and Holocaust, the magnitude of Jewish contributions to Hungary's literature, journalism, scholarship, culture, science, industry, banking and commercial enterprise had been almost without precedent in the annals of diaspora Jewish communities, and post-Holocaust Jewish Hungarians continue to play a prominent role in the literary, cultural, political, and academic life of contemporary post-Communist Hungary. However, the core issues of dual identity and co-existence that were first broached with such optimism {{in the middle of the}} 19 th century are still unresolved and are likely to engage the attention of new generations of Hungarian-Jewish writers into the foreseeable future...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} origins and early {{evolution}} of the Philanthropic Society {{with the aim of}} making a contribution {{to our understanding of the}} dynamics of philanthropy. The Society was founded, in 1788, at a time of growing public concern over the failure of existing legal measures to stem <b>a</b> perceived <b>rising</b> <b>tide</b> <b>of</b> crime. Explicitly conceived as a crime prevention enterprise, the Society focused its attention on a constituency of poor children who either seemed destined for or who had already embarked on a criminal career. The Society's educational experiment in moulding them into law-abiding citizens was initially located in a group of family houses scattered around the village of Hackney. It then made a swift transition to a purpose built Institution in Southwark and remained there until a decision to establish a Reformatory Farm School, at Redhill, was taken in 1848. On one level, this study describes how the Society's development was nurtured by Philanthropists with a diversity of interests in the fields of commerce, jurisprudence, medicine, local poor-law and penal administration. It presents new information on the interplay of ideas and influences that helped shape the Society's institutional policy and practice over the period. At another level, this study takes us through a pre-modem policy landscape to the point at which a voluntary enterprise in protection, prevention and reformation attracted the support of the Government and became the subject of statutory action. By examining hitherto underused Philanthropic archival sources and previously overlooked Government documents, it traces a complex network of interaction between informal and formal agencies in the dissemination of reforming ideas and the shaping of social policy. In doing so, it describes how conventional views on the respective roles and relationships between charitable agencies and the State began to change during the early nineteenth century.

40|$|Advance {{directives}} are instructions {{given by}} patients – or potential patients – specifying what actions {{ought to be}} taken for their health {{in the event that}} they are no longer capable to make decisions due to illness or incapacity. Over the last decades, there has been <b>a</b> <b>rising</b> <b>tide</b> in favour <b>of</b> advance directives: not only is the use of such directives recommended by most medical and advisory bodies, they are also gaining increasing legal recognition {{in many parts of the}} world. This book, however, takes as its point of departure one of the most commonly discussed medical-ethical arguments against granting advance directives moral force: the Objection from Personal Identity. The adherers of this objection basically asserts that when there is lacking psychological continuity between the person who formulated the advance directive and the later patient to whom it supposedly applies, this seriously threatens the directive’s moral authority. And, further, that this is so because lacking sufficient psychological continuity implies that the author of the advance directive is numerically distinct from the later patient. Although this argument has some initial appeal, most philosophers in the advance directives debate maintain that the Objection from Personal Identity fails, but suggest different reasons as to why. Whereas some argue that the objection has no force because it rests on faulty beliefs about personal identity, others argue that we ought to grant advance directives moral authority even if the author and the later patient are numerically distinct beings. This book investigates some of the most influential of these arguments and reaches the conclusion that the Objection from Personal Identity has more to it than is usually recognized in the medical-ethical debate. Lacking sufficient psychological continuity between author and later patient, it is concluded, does threaten the moral authority of the advance directive...|$|R
