Regan elaborated that [...] "she’s never seen <b>anyone</b> <b>like</b> [...] before and she’s never been beaten before. There’s this competitive but playful obsession with her" [...] which is seen with Underwood's [...] "flirtation" [...] and [...] "feminine prowess". Regan continued, [...] "She knows that to be on top she has to beat Peggy ... So Dottie does want to get under her skin. She tries to make her feel uncomfortable and that might be with a look or a glance or what she says." [...] Atwell said, [...] "Peggy has male baddies that she fights, but to have someone who is physically her equal—she's a Black Widow, incredibly capable and very smart—I think that shows some balance for Peggy, like a flip side of the same coin." [...] After Carter defeats Underwood and Leviathan in the first season, Underwood becomes [...] "a lone wolf ... she’s a woman without a country right now, but she is more involved in the [...] case" [...] for the second season than it initially appears.|$|E
500|$|Bannon {{followed}} Odd Girl Out with I Am a Woman (In Love With a Woman — Must Society Reject Me?) in 1959. I Am a Woman (the {{working and}} common title) featured Laura after her affair with Beth, as {{she finds herself}} in New York City's Greenwich Village, and meets a wisecracking gay man named Jack, and becomes his best friend. Laura has to choose between a straight woman with a wild and curious streak, and a fascinating new character {{that proved to be}} her most popular of the series, Beebo Brinker, who came to embody the description of a thoroughly butch lesbian. Beebo was smart, handsome, chivalrous, and virile. Once again based on what Bannon knew, Beebo was nearly [...] tall with a husky voice and a formidable physique. The personality however, Bannon says, was drawn out of her sheer need for Beebo to exist. After spending time in Greenwich Village and not finding <b>anyone</b> <b>like</b> her, Bannon instead created her. She remembered, [...] "I put Beebo together just as I wanted her, in my heart and mind... She was just, quite literally, the butch of my dreams." [...] The resolution to I Am a Woman completely flouted the trends of miserable lesbian fiction endings, which made Ann Bannon a hero to many lesbians.|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} commended by several critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, [...] "I've never met <b>anyone</b> <b>like</b> Forrest Gump {{in a movie}} before, {{and for that matter}} I've never seen a movie quite like 'Forrest Gump.' Any attempt to {{describe}} him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream. The screenplay by Eric Roth has the complexity of modern fiction...The performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths...What a magical movie." [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote that the film [...] "has been very well worked out on all levels, and manages the difficult feat of being an intimate, even delicate tale played with an appealingly light touch against an epic backdrop." [...] The film did receive notable pans from several major reviewers. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker called the film [...] "Warm, wise, and wearisome as hell." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said that the film [...] "reduces the tumult of the last few decades to a virtual-reality theme park: a baby-boomer version of Disney's America." ...|$|E

Notice, I do not say the Israeli."

2500|$|At the Atlanta Games, American {{swimming}} officials criticized Ireland's Michelle Smith {{about her}} unexpected gold medals , suggesting {{that she might}} have been using performance-enhancing drugs. [...] When asked about the accusations, Evans said that when <b>anyone</b> <b>like</b> Smith showed such a significant improvement, [...] "there's always that question." [...] American sportswriters sympathetic to Smith took this comment to mean that Evans was accusing Smith of steroid use as well , and they attacked Evans as being a sore loser. [...] Evans later insisted that she meant no such accusation and that her remarks were taken out of context. [...] In 1998, Smith received a four-year suspension for tampering with a urine sample.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most notable}} of these first four films was Oscar-winning drama Dangerous Liaisons, in which Thurman's {{character}} of Cecile de Volanges is {{seduced by the}} manipulative Vicomte de Valmont (John Malkovich). A commercial success, the picture also garnered Thurman recognition and acclaim from critics and audiences; film critic Roger Ebert found her to be [...] "well cast" [...] in her [...] "tricky" [...] key role. At the time, insecure about her appearance, she spent roughly a year in London, during which she often wore loose, baggy clothing. Malkovich said of her, [...] "There is nothing twitchy teenager-ish about her, I haven’t met <b>anyone</b> <b>like</b> her at that age. Her intelligence and poise stand out.

2500|$|Amal Saad-Ghorayeb, a Shiite {{scholar and}} {{assistant}} professor at the Lebanese American University has written that Hezbollah is not Anti-Zionist, but rather Anti-Jewish. She quoted Hassan Nasrallah as saying: [...] "If we searched the entire world for a person more cowardly, despicable, weak and feeble in psyche, mind, ideology and religion, we would not find <b>anyone</b> <b>like</b> the Jew. Notice, I do not say the Israeli." [...] Regarding the official public stance of Hezbollah as a whole, she said that while Hezbollah, [...] "tries to mask its anti-Judaism for public-relations reasons ... a study of its language, spoken and written, reveals an underlying truth." [...] In her book Hezbollah: Politics & Religion, she argues that Hezbollah [...] "believes that Jews, by the nature of Judaism, possess fatal character flaws". Saad-Ghorayeb also said, [...] "Hezbollah's Quranic reading of Jewish history has led its leaders to believe that Jewish theology is evil." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 2010, Hopkins {{suggested}} that African American fighters who possessed {{what he described}} as a [...] "slick" [...] inner-city style of fighting would be successful against Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao.

But I do think that a fighter like the Ray Leonards or <b>anyone</b> <b>like</b> that would beat a guy [...] if they come with their game.

2500|$|In the 1946 Christmas episode, for example, Benny buys {{shoelaces}} for Don, and {{is unable}} to {{make up his mind}} whether to give Wilson shoelaces with plastic tips or metal tips. After exchanging them repeatedly, Mel Blanc is heard screaming insanely, [...] "Plastic tips! Metal tips! I can't stand it anymore!" [...] A variation in 1948 was with an expensive wallet, but repeatedly changing the greeting card, prompting Blanc to shout, [...] "I haven't run into <b>anyone</b> <b>like</b> you in 20 years! Oh, why did the governor have to give me that pardon!?" [...] Benny then realizes that he should have gotten Don a wallet for $1.98, whereupon the store clerk responds by committing suicide. Over the years, in the Christmas episodes, Benny bought and repeatedly exchanged cuff links, golf tees, a box of dates, a paint set (water colors or oils), and a gopher trap. In later years, Benny would encounter Mel Blanc's wife (played by Jean Vander Pyl) or the clerk's psychiatrist at the store, and drive them crazy as well.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, Thomas batted [...]317 with a club-record 41 homers, plus 128 RBI, 106 runs scored, and 112 walks. He {{joined a}} quartet of Hall of Famers (Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx and Ted Williams) as the only players in {{baseball}} history to eclipse [...]300 with more than 20 homers and more than 100 RBI, runs, and walks in three straight seasons. On {{the back of this}} historic offensive output, Thomas collected all 28 votes from baseball writers for a unanimous AL Most Valuable Player award, the first by a White Sox player since Dick Allen in 1972, while leading the White Sox to their first AL West crown in 10 years. At the time, statistical analyst Bill James projected career statistics of 480 homers and a [...]311 lifetime average. Then-manager Gene Lamont was laudatory of Thomas' skills: [...] "I've only seen him two years now, but I'm convinced that there isn't a pitch he can't hit." [...] White Sox announcer Ken Harrelson echoed the praise, [...] "In my 30 years in the game, I've never seen <b>anyone</b> <b>like</b> Big Hurt (Thomas). In another 30 years, we may be talking about Frank Thomas in the same way we talk about Ted Williams." [...] Thomas credited Harrelson with coining the [...] "Big Hurt" [...] nickname.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 November, in a 4–0 {{victory over}} Granada, Ronaldo made league history when he scored his 17th league {{goal of the}} season in just 10 games; the record was {{previously}} held by Isidro Lángara, who scored 16 goals in the first ten games of the 1935–36 season for Real Oviedo. On 22 November, Messi equalled, and then went past, Telmo Zarra's goalscoring record of 251 when he scored a hat-trick against Sevilla. Luis Enrique praised him following the achievement, saying that he is [...] "one-of-a-kind and we'll never see <b>anyone</b> <b>like</b> him ever again and we are privileged to have him and be able to watch him". On 6 December, Ronaldo overtook Zarra's record of 22 La Liga hat-tricks, which he jointly held with Alfredo Di Stéfano, when he scored three against Celta Vigo. The goals meant he became the quickest player to reach 200 La Liga goals, accomplishing the feat in just 178 games, surpassing Zarra's record of 219 games to reach the milestone. The following day, Messi responded by scoring his third hat-trick in his four games, his 21st La Liga hat-trick in total. The continuous record breaking was said be down to the pairs' [...] "spellbinding skill, relentless application, athletic charisma", while journalist Sid Lowe said that this latest accomplishment [...] "probably doesn't count as a story any more".|$|E
