30|$|Various VOCs have {{physical}} and chemical characteristics that differ significantly. Water-solubility and biodegradability are the two main factors that influence the removal efficiency of biofilters (Deshusses and Webster 2000). Low water-solubility limits mass transfer prior degradation (Alonso et al. 1998), while biodegradability influences the degradation of soluble VOCs. Among all pollutants, hydrocarbons (i.e., alcohols, ketones, esters etc.) {{have been shown to}} be the easiest degraded compounds, before alkene and aromatic hydrocarbon (Delhomenie and Heitz 2005). Therefore, different types of VOCs alter biofilter performances and microbial community structures significantly.

And, it could also reduce percentage of threshing. <b>Air</b> discharge <b>treatment</b> on grape storage appearance had obvious good effect. Air discharge preservation technology can effectively extend the storage time of fruits and vegetables. Improper air discharge can also cause damage to plasmalemma of fruits and vegetables.
