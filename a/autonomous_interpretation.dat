40|$|Abstract. Automated image {{interpretation}} {{is an important}} task in numerous applications ranging from security systems to natural resource inventorization based on remote-sensing. Recently, a second generation of adaptive machine-learned {{image interpretation}} systems have shown expert-level performance in several challenging domains. While demonstrating an unprecedented improvement over hand-engineered and first generation machine-learned systems in terms of cross-domain portability, design-cycle time, and robustness, such systems are still severely limited. This paper inspects the anatomy of the state-of-the-art Multi resolution Adaptive Object Recognition framework (MR ADORE) and presents extensions that aim at removing {{the last vestiges of}} human intervention still present in the original design of ADORE. More specifically, feature selection is still a task performed by human domain experts and represents a major stumbling block in the creation process of fully <b>autonomous</b> image <b>interpretation</b> systems. This paper focuses on minimizing such need for human engineering. After discussing experimental results, showing the performance of the framework extensions in the domain of forestry, the paper concludes by outlining autonomous feature extraction methods that may completely remove the need for human expertise in the feature selection process...|$|R

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} three important ideals that Nietzsche recommends: {{the ideals of}} Sovereignty, of Wholeness, and of Becoming What One Is. I locate the main texts where Nietzsche addresses each of these topics and I offer a consistent and coherent interpretation of them. On my reading, the ideal of Becoming What One Is involves a process whereby we become mature and give expression to our own uniqueness. This process requires an active self-reflection on our part and a dynamic practice of relinquishing and regaining our capacity to {{be the cause of}} our own behavior (the capacity for autonomous self-control). Besides emphasizing the ideal’s connection to authenticity and our capacity to be <b>autonomous,</b> my <b>interpretation</b> provides a more detailed description of the mechanisms whereby one attains this ideal than that offered by other commentators. In the case of the ideal of Sovereignty, I argue that for Nietzsche becoming sovereign entails accepting and even embracing one’s susceptibility to moral guilt. For Nietzsche, having a sovereign conscience means understanding oneself as a morally responsible agent. This self-understanding confers on us a freedom that other creatures do not have, but at the cost of becoming subject to blame and guilt for our wrongdoings. In this respect, my account is at odds with the propensity in the secondary literature to characterize Nietzsche as a staunch opponent of the moral notion of guilt. Finally, my interpretation of Wholeness runs against the grain of the prevalent readings that characterize this as an ideal of psychic unity aimed at restructuring the various parts of the agent’s mind into a harmonious whole. I argue, on the contrary, that wholeness fundamentally concerns social – not psychic – integration: the person becomes whole by placing himself within the circle of genuine culture in which he works together with others in the perfection of nature and freedom. In this way, the person finds redemption from the meaninglessness of existence by ensuring that his energies survive into the future within a suprapersonal community in which life and creativity are perpetually renewed and guaranteed...|$|R

40|$|Despite ever growing {{international}} trade and dispute settlement, a consistent international methodology of uniform private law {{has yet to be}} formed. This is needed in order to encourage the use of existing uniform transnational law rules specifically designed for application to international commercial contracts. This study examines uniform contract law in legal methodology and considers the barriers which exist toward it in modern nation states. It explores ways in which these barriers can be overcome and considers whether it is thereby possible to create a specific methodology of international contract law. Through exploring these three areas, this thesis intends to distinguish and analyse the main obstacles to the application of uniform contract law. The study is therefore organized into three sections, each exploring one of those methodological obstacles and providing solutions for overcoming them. Part One discusses the barriers erected by traditional theories of contract law. Part Two addresses the attitude taken by national lawyers when applying uniform law and enquires how this attitude is formed. This section also asks why this attitude provides an obstacle to the success of uniform law and considers ways in which it could be changed. Part Three, the third and final section considers the treatment of uniform contract law in the context of conflict of laws. This section also asks how seemingly opposite positions in the modern and traditional theory of private international law can be reconciled and considers the ways in which uniform contract law can be applied within a domestic law context as lex contractus. The author argues that the points of resistance identified can be tackled by developing an <b>autonomous</b> methodology of <b>interpretation</b> of transnational contract principles; and, by treating model sets of transnational contract principles as a form of lex specialis. Overall, the thesis seeks to demonstrate that the potential of the UPICC has not yet been fully recognised, and that barriers to such recognition are not insurmountable.

40|$|Advances in the {{capabilities}} of robotic planetary exploration missions have increased the wealth of scientific data they produce, presenting challenges for mission science and operations imposed by the limits of interplanetary radio communications. These data budget pressures can be relieved by increased robotic autonomy, both for onboard operations tasks and for decision- making in response to science data. This thesis presents new techniques in automated image interpretation for natural scenes of relevance to planetary science and exploration, and elaborates autonomy scenarios under which they {{could be used to}} extend the reach and performance of exploration missions on planetary surfaces. Two computer vision techniques are presented. The first is an algorithm for autonomous classification and segmentation of geological scenes, allowing a photograph of a rock outcrop to be automatically divided into regions by rock type. This important task, currently performed by specialists on Earth, is a prerequisite to decisions about instrument pointing, data triage, and event-driven operations. The approach uses a novel technique to seek distinct visual regions in outcrop photographs. It first generates a feature space by extracting multiple types of visual information from the image. Then, in a training step using labeled exemplar scenes, it applies Mahalanobis distance metric learning (in particular, Multiclass Linear Discriminant Analysis) to discover the linear transformation of the feature space which best separates the geological classes. With the learned representation applied, a vector clustering technique is then used to segment new scenes. The second technique interrogates sequences of images of the sky to extract, from the motion of clouds, the wind vector at the condensation level — a measurement not normally available for Mars. To account for the deformation of clouds and the ephemerality of their fine-scale features, a template-matching technique (normalized cross-correlation) is used to mutually register images and compute the clouds’ motion. Both techniques are tested successfully on imagery from a variety of relevant analogue environments on Earth, and on data returned from missions to the planet Mars. For both, scenarios are elaborated for their use in <b>autonomous</b> science data <b>interpretation,</b> and to thereby automate certain steps in the process of robotic exploration...|$|R
40|$|The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sales of Goods (CISG) {{came into}} force in 1988 when the {{required}} number of States deposited their instruments of ratification. In 1989 the relevant Australian Parliaments introduced the CISG as the Sale of Goods (Vienna Convention) Act. Through that process the Convention {{became part of}} our domestic law. Significantly articles 7 and 8 - the interpretative articles - were incorporated into the CISG. Article 7 basically has two functions. First it assists in interpreting the Convention and secondly it defines {{the boundary between the}} application of the CISG and domestic law. Article 7 (1) requires that the CISG be interpreted uniformly to promote the international character of the Convention. Recourse to domestic principles is not allowed. A new <b>autonomous</b> method of <b>interpretation</b> is developed with the aid of case law and practices. Article 7 also points to the application of good faith in international trade. Good faith as a principle is not only applied to the interpretation of the CISG as a whole but it also regulates the behavior of the parties. Article 7 (2) recognizes that the CISG was never intended to be a complete statement of sales laws. The members of the diplomatic conference in Vienna could not agree on the inclusion of several important principles of contract law into the Convention such as the principle of validity. As a consequence article 7 also delineates between the application of the CISG and domestic law through the process of gap filling. This thesis develops the principles and tools needed to implement article 7 (2) as gaps need to be filled in conformity with the general principles on which the CISG is based. It is also contended that restatements of contract law, such as the UNIDROIT Principles, if adopted by contractual parties will minimize references to domestic law. In response to the mandate of article 7, this thesis shows that tribunals and courts will look for a solution within the "Four Corners" of the CISG in a manner contemplated by those preparing it rather than taking recourse to domestic law. It is also argued that the failure to apply the rules contained within the "Four Corners" does not indicate an unwillingness to depart from domestic laws. Rather it reveals that a "sophisticated grasp" of the provisions of the CISG has not yet been achieved. Article 8 explains the interpretative rules regarding the relations between contractual parties. In particular the subjective as well as the objective intent of parties must be elicited in order to arrive at a correct understanding of the mutual obligations entered into by the parties. Article 8 touches on subtle and difficult issues, which are only partially solved through article 7. Some domestic doctrines such as the parol evidence rule and the rules on mistake need to be abandoned or reviewed. This thesis highlights the importance of reading the CISG within its "Four Corners" as individual articles cannot be read and interpreted in isolation. They are connected through general principles on which the CISG is based. The conclusion, supported by doctrinal writing and international jurisprudence, is that the CISG has been interpreted pursuant to the autonomous mandate and that courts in general have understood the significant differences of the CISG compared to domestic law...|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the philosophic-educational {{findings}} in the field of history and axiology of education. First, this paper focuses its attention on industrial society, as the specific background of the formation of the idea of “classical education”. Based on the scientific theory of A. Toynbee’s “local civilizations”, the author identifies and describes the existence of five educational landscapes of industrial type that find their places in global history in the time period between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries. After analyzing the common historical and philosophical trends in each of these regions, the study concludes that for the emergence of public education, the secularization of education and training systems, and beginning the process of becoming egalitarian high school were natural consequences of the formation of national economies in most countries of the industrial world. First of all, industrial production has never been possible without the actual quality of agricultural production — it is the second increase in performance is made possible mass flow of the labor force in the region of light and heavy industry, and manufactory is converted to the factory. From now on, fewer and fewer families have a closed mini-production, production is increasingly an organization that controls the fate of a large mass of people from here and there are new problems of collective responsibility, which are displayed on the then hereditary and the modern curriculum. It was born in the industrial age value bases of modern interpersonal relationships, there is commerce in the modern sense of the word, crystallized structure of capitalism and socialism, there is the concept of “compulsory education”. Dialectical opposites that existed during the agrarian society there remain its theoretical and practical forces, together with those was born a new attitude that recite complications educational meanings and values. “Perfect Man” is becoming more diverse, that is <b>autonomous</b> in its <b>interpretation.</b> This process of diversification of educational ideals still ongoing, and thus the value of education of the industrial age have modified their reflection in the era of globalization. The educational landscape is a universal system of interrelated causes and effects of the formation of educational values and traditions within a particular historical epoch and a particular geographic and cultural space. Based on the conceptual and empirical basis of the theory of “local civilizations” Alfred Toynbee, during the formation, development and transformation of industrial society coexisted following educational landscapes: western, Orthodox Christian, eastern Arabic, far eastern Sino-Korean and far-eastern. The beginning of the Industrial revolution marked a new historical challenges for educational systems all educational landscape of our planet. In terms of the then metamorphoses era, education is a necessary lever for economic influence. During this period, the gap between scientific invention and its embodiment in production is significantly reduced, which leads to improving the status of objective necessity of educational services. But at the same time, the practical importance of higher education in these times there is enough “restrained” in order to preserve the autonomy of the university, and lead to the classical ideal of higher education. The latter, promotes the idea of knowledge {{as an end in itself}} and entirely based on spiritual principles of learning content. The industrial revolution — a phase of development of education, secularization system of training and education, beginning the process of egalitarian reforms in the system of higher education. All of these changes were the result of objective socio-economic needs and were projected by the «spirit of the enlightenment». Analyzing trends in the industrial history of the most educational landscape, one can conclude that at within different in each place regarding similar events that occurred during the global historical reasons. The latter are closely related to the experience of every stage of formation of the state of the national economy, which in turn has an indirect impact on the educational dimension of social existence of nations...|$|R

40|$|To discuss {{reflexivity}} {{in anthropology}} {{is not a}} new approach. The {{purpose of this article is}} to examine the meaning of reflexivity for the hermeneutical or confessional anthropology, which has been endemic in social sciences ever since the publication of Malinowski’s di- aries and the onset of the recurrent and persistent crisis of objectivity that haunts modern scholarship. We have determined that anthropology is no longer a one-sided, self-centred, objective science. Today anthropology is interpreted for its subjectivity and its multiple faces that create a mosaic reflection of the anthropologist and the researcher. This article aims not to be innovative, for it is far from accomplishing such a task. This article, howe- ver, discusses the coherence of a discourse that emanates from contested narratives about the self. It responds to what some call the reflexive turn in anthropology – a homology between defamiliarisation and literary exposition, which undermines the fictionality (or the falsehood) of anthropological writing, in the sense that each reflexive critique is in its own right an <b>autonomous</b> <b>interpretation,</b> blurring the lines between the true and the imaginary (understood from Latin as a sort of plastic modelling, self-construction).

40|$|In a {{considerable}} number of areas, the European Union has developed its own state-like foreign policy. One important dimension is participation in international legal regimes. This is membership of international organisations and the signing of multilateral conventions. Because of the EU’s internal complexity participation in international legal regimes raises many issues of a constitutional nature. The Court of Justice has repeatedly been asked to scrutinise whether a particular case of participation is in compliance with EU law. In this regard, {{it is fair to say}} that the Court of Justice’s greatest concern has been the preservation of the autonomy of the EU legal order and more specifically the <b>autonomous</b> <b>interpretation</b> of EU law by the Court itself. Indeed, the Court has not so far accepted that it must be submitted to the authority of any external (quasi-) judicial structure. The two most prominent examples of international (quasi-) judicial bodies that have had and will continue to have a normative impact on the EU are the dispute settlement mechanism of the World Trade Organization and the European Court of Human Rights. As is well known the EU is a member of the WTO, while negotiations for accession to the European Convention on Human Rights are ongoing.

40|$|CISG Articles 47 and 49 (1) (b) {{are part}} of the regime of {{remedies}} of breach of contract within the CISG, which in general can be divided into two categories: remedies where the contract can be terminated or avoided, such as fundamental breach, and remedies where the contract is still in force, such as damages. Articles 47 and 49 (1) (b) are provisions that span both remedies through the principle of the Nachfrist, which is the granting of additional time for the delivery of goods. The principle has been mainly borrowed from German domestic law, {{as well as from the}} French procedure of mise en demeure. However, there are significant differences between the German and French treatment of Nachfrist and the one accorded to in the CISG. This is a good time to remind ourselves of the mandate of Article 7 (1) where uniformity of application demands the <b>autonomous</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the CISG; that is, without relying on principles founded in domestic law. In other words, German and French treatment of Nachfrist and mise en demeure must be ignored and cannot be used to explain the principle within the CISG, despite significant similarities in doctrine and jurisprudence. Common law attorneys may find the concept of Nachfrist foreign as this term has no direct common law counterpart.

These interpretative choices already present judges operating in a national context with difficulties, but that is even more so for European judges operating in a multilevel context. The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) are often criticized for delivering judgments that contain debatable choices and do not offer sufficient insight into the reasons which have led the courts to make these choices. Especially in a multilevel context where the cooperation of national authorities plays an important role as regards the effectiveness of the European courts, it is important that interpretation methods and principles are used in a transparent manner so that the reasons that justify a specific interpretative choice are clear. This book analyses the use of a selected number of interpretation methods and principles in the fundamental rights case law of the ECtHR and the CJEU. The use of teleological, comparative, evolutive and <b>autonomous</b> <b>interpretation</b> by the ECtHR and the CJEU are elaborately discussed on the basis of both legal theoretical literature and case law. The legal theoretical analysis provides the basis for various relevant questions, hypotheses and (analytical) suggestions, that are further studied in the subsequent case law analysis. This leads to a thorough overview of the role of these interpretation methods and principles and the possibilities for improvement. Promotor: J. H. GerardsWith Summary in DutchNW...|$|E

Predstavljene so sodne odločbe Sodišča Evropske unije, med katere sodi tudi odločba Land Berlin proti Ellen Mirjam Sapir, ki je izrednega pomena glede določanja mednarodne pristojnosti po Uredbi št. 1215 / 2012, v kateri je Sodišče Evropske unije odstopilo od dosedanje sodne prakse. Pod pojem civilne in gospodarske zadeve uvršča tudi {{institut}} neupravičene obogatitve ter s tem neposredno širi zgoraj omenjen pojem. My thesis {{deals with}} the necessity of <b>autonomous</b> <b>interpretation</b> {{of the concept of}} civil and commercial matter according to the first paragraph of the first article of the Regulation no. 1215 / 2012 of the European parliament and of the council on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Nevertheless this is only applicable in the cases where one of the parties is a public entity. In the thesis I present the decisions of the European Court of Justice including the milestone decision in the case Land Berlin v Ellen Mirjam Sapir. This decision is of remarkable importance when deciding about international jurisdiction according to the Regulation no. 1215 / 2012. In this case the European Court of Justice decided differently than in the previous cases and under the concept of civil and commercial matter classified also the institute of unjustified benefit and in that way broadened the concept...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the figure}} of Francesco Saverio Bianchi – whether for his {{manifold}} activities (professor of Civil Law at Parma and Siena universities, judge of the Court of Cassation of Turin and Rome, State Councillor and President of the Council of State), or for his long earthly sojourn that brought him to witness and participate to the various seasons of the European juridical science from the 1840 s {{to the beginning of}} 1900, or yet for the impressive number of papers and books he uninterruptedly wrote for half a century – means to be able to delineate the profile of the Italian jurist who shifted between two juridical experiences, the pre-unitary one, which formed him, and the national one. This paper will consider {{the figure of}} Bianchi as a theorist of civil law, trying to catch the evolution of his thought, which is also made of changes of mind, as we shall see with reference to the crucial and extremely sensitive problem of the judge-law relationship. In terms of his scientific method, Bianchi is quite an original jurist. Once he took up the university chair he understood that the classical method of his masters, which consisted in commenting the rules following the order in the civil code, was unsatisfactory. He was deeply convinced that educational-scientific analysis needs a more general and complete development; in brief, a methodology which allows the interpreter to move agilely inside the code and to build up his <b>autonomous</b> <b>interpretation.</b> This approach enabled him to elaborate a personal commentary, a text that reflects his thought, without inferiority complex towards the Francophone doctrine, which undoubtedly represents his first reference point...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} {{international}} law obligations that have binding force on the Union and/or its Member States is sharply increasing. This paper argues that in this light the well-functioning of the European Union ultimately depends on {{the protection of the}} principle of supremacy from law originating outside of the EU legal order. The supremacy of EU law is essential to ensuring that Member States cannot use national rules to justify derogation from EU law. As a matter of principle, international treaties concluded by the Member States rank at the level of ordinary national law within the European legal order and below all forms of European law (both primary and secondary). Article 351 TFEU exceptionally allows Member States to derogate from primary EU law in order to comply with obligations under anterior international agreements. It does not however allow a departure from the principle of supremacy that underlies the European legal order. In Kadi I, the Court of Justice of the European Union stated that Article 351 TFEU, while it permits derogation from primary law, may under no circumstances permit circumvention of the "very foundations" of the EU legal order. This introduces an additional condition that all acts within the sphere of EU law need to comply with a form of "super-supreme law". It also strengthened the principle of supremacy and gave the Court of Justice the role of the guardian of the Union's "foundations". The Court of Justice acted on the necessity of defending the Union as a distinct legal order, retaining the <b>autonomous</b> <b>interpretation</b> of its own law, and ultimately ensuring that the Union can act as an independent actor on the international plane...|$|E
40|$|Architectural {{representations}} do {{not merely}} realize {{the transmission of}} intervened information between the architect and his audience. Through the growing importance of representation {{and the use of}} digital means of expression, which is obviously met in contemporary architectural discourse, one can safely suggest that in certain cases the information is created rather than treated or consumed through the procedure of digital representation.   The issue raised is of far greater range than just the replacement of traditional means of representation. One can already trace definite signs of a new communicative entity, profoundly based upon the use of digital means, alongside the classic body of architecture. This new essence is the result of architectural representation, in its <b>autonomous</b> <b>interpretation,</b> when it creates the meaning and the information that initially was assigned only to transmit. All these special conditions are more effectively reflected into a new concept, this of “high code architecture”. “High code architecture” implies and presupposes the existence of an additional inner mechanism that creates it. The procedure of emancipation of the architectural representations is rather incomplete without the validity of an associating mechanism between the representation itself and the represented object. This phenomenon can be studied through a diagram of de-materialization and reinstallation of architecture. This diagram is materialized in three distinctive stages: 1. The architectural object is de-materialized through various representations and procurations via digital, figurative and print media to finally become an image. 2. The images, as representatives and/or substitutes of an architectural object, re-materialize and form a kind of architecture that is of “abstracted perception” and free of theoretic and ideological weights. 3. An array of morphological types, “iconic picturesi is created, that form the base of the so called “high code architecture”...|$|E
40|$|In its UsedSoft and Ranks {{judgments}} the CJEU {{interprets the}} concept of distribution and its digital exhaustion with regard to copyright on computer programs. Both concepts are read {{in a way that}} deviates from their meaning concerning copyright on other works. The reasons for that divergence are analysed and criticised. The Computer Programs Directive should be interpreted in conformity with the WIPO Copyright Treaty. Case law should distinguish between the specific rationales that underlie certain aspects of the exhaustion doctrine. The CJEU’s <b>autonomous</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the sale condition for exhaustion is unfortunate, among other things because downloaded copies are not goods subject to transferrable ownership. Copyright law is not digital property law. The sale concept is drifting away from its original meaning. Concerning the exceptions to the reproduction right on programs, it is upheld that backups cannot be provided to third parties. Subsequent acquirers of programs by contrast do qualify as lawful acquirers who can benefit from the exception for intended use. Calling on this exception, the Court seems to set course to the recognition of a resale and/or download right of some kind. In sum, the meaning of exhaustion has evolved from a boundary of an exclusive right, over a higher norm to a subjective right of a third party. In reality, the debate could be simplified by looking at rights rather than copies. With regard to the supply of digital content, the simultaneous existence of a material-object and licence contract should be recognised. The former can be a sales or service contract. Online deliveries are services. Whoever holds a right to a service, can principally transfer that right and the licence to third parties. Applying the same rationales that underlie the exhaustion doctrine would mean that clauses preventing such transfers are void. The actual exhaustion doctrine however need not be applied...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which New Zealand’s Centennial Great War exhibitions impact visitor perceptions, particularly those regarding their personal moral values. Two case studies are used, in order to inform discussions on the current and desired roles of New Zealand museums in relation to activism. While this research aims to provide New Zealand museums with more relevant findings than literature gaps currently allow, any discussions and recommendations may be more broadly applied to other countries. Similarly, despite a focus on the topical and largely publicised subject of WWI ‘ 100 years on’, discussions and recommendations are also relevant to general queries regarding museum representations, visitor interpretations and activism in museums. This research also intends to emphasise the benefits of interdisciplinary research by including museological, criminological and, to a lesser extent, philosophical literature. The research methods used within the two case studies can be broadly separated into three parts. First, a thick description method is used to provide in-depth overviews of The Great War Exhibition and Te Papa Tongarewa’s Gallipoli: The Scale of Our War. This section attempts to present a largely unbiased description of Great War representation in New Zealand’s capital. Second, the interpretations of ten visitors from each exhibition are gathered in the form of researcher-accompanied, audio-recorded visits. Such a research method intends to extract visitor thought processes in a relatively fluid and natural way. Finally, visitor questionnaires taken at the conclusion of each visit provide information on visitor demographics and overall thoughts regarding the exhibition, war itself and any inclusion of activism in museums. Alongside museum studies literature, criminological literature and debates are referenced to explain and exemplify the plentiful and diverse perceptions surrounding war. Overall, this study found most participants to be wary of activism in museum exhibitions. However, it also found that New Zealand museum visitors tended to possess a strong desire to determine their own moral perceptions through exposure to as many alternative narratives as possible. Therefore, any opposition to activism is not, in this case, due to any overriding wishes to favour ‘traditional narratives’. It is consequentially recommended that emphasis be put on clarity, transparency and multi-narrative approaches in museum exhibitions, as visitors appear to so strongly value their right to <b>autonomous</b> <b>interpretation...</b>|$|E
