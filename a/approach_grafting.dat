[...] Micrografting is a new technique that has been recently integrated into micropropagation production for hybrid tomato. This method uses micropropagated scion shoots that grafted onto 3 week-old rootstock seedlings. The most common commercial technique for grafting tomato is tube grafting. Tube grafting takes place when the scion and rootstock are severed as seedlings and reattached with a small, silicone tube or clip. [...] This technique has been highly effective as it can be carried out when plants are very small, thereby eliminating the need for large healing chambers while increasing the output.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{prevalent}} modality {{to increase}} the amount of available bone prior to implantation is grafting of the maxillary sinus. Multiple factors such as the surgical technique, moment of implant placement as well as grafting materials and membranes are known to affect implant survival. However, the role of different factor combinations and associated reciprocal effects remain unclear. Conventional statistical methods do not consider inconsistency of study designs and do not take covariables into account. Hence, a systematic research and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the influence of various treatment modalities on implant survival in the grafted maxillary sinus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. Articles published from 1980 through January 2013 were electronically and manually searched in MEDLINE (Ovid), the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, the Database of Abstracts of Effects, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Clinical reports on single intervention sinus augmentation with root-form implants, a minimum of 10 patients and 6 months of loading were eligible for inclusion if implant survival was stated or calculable. Results were calculated by non-parametric univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis and Bayesian multivariate interval-censored Cox regression. RESULTS: A total of 122 publications on 16268 endosseous implants placed in grafted maxillary sinus were included. The treatment parameters surgical <b>approach,</b> <b>grafting</b> material and implant type showed no selective preference. However, application of membranes showed a significantly reduced hazard-ratio, independent of other co-factors.

This thesis discusses the means used to mechanically transmit pear viruses, the properties of those viruses and their relationships with latent viruses of apple. Herbaceous plant virus indicators did not develop symptoms when they were grafted with infected pears. Virus was only mechanically transmitted to herbaceous plants when the reducing agent cysteine hydrochloride and a chelator of the copper in polyphenol oxidase, sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, {{were added to the}} grinding medium, phosphate buffer. A virus was mechanically transmitted to Chenopodium amaranticolor from four pear species inoculated with one virus source, and Bartlett pear (B- 13) previously inoculated with seven virus sources. C. amaranticolor developed local lesions, systemic oakleaf patterns and chlorosis, and was the only genus which became infected. All virus sources were positive for ring mosaic and vein yellows symptoms. The virus which incited ring mosaic symptoms was filtered through inoculated Prunus spp. and in this way was separated from the vein yellows virus. Similar symptoms were incited in C. amaranticolor by a virus mechanically transmitted from pear showing only ring mosaic symptoms. The pear virus isolates incited two local lesion types on C. quinoa. "Type 1 " lesion was water-soaked, tan and 2 to 3 mm in diameter. "Type 2 " lesion was brown and 1 mm in diameter. The two pear virus isolates were partially purified by homogenizing infected C. quinoa tissue in phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, cysteine hydrochloride and a clarifying agent, bentonite, and concentrating the suspension with one low and one high speed centrifugation. Purified preparations of these isolates infected seven other herbaceous plant genera. The pear virus isolates incited symptoms in Chenopodium identical to the symptoms incited by virus isolates transmitted from apple. Twelve of fifteen apple virus isolates were transmitted from apple sources which had caused a chlorotic leaf spot reaction in Hopa crab apple. The Hopa crab reaction is thought to be caused by the chlorotic leaf spot virus. Physical, chemical and serological properties of the pear viruses show they are closely related to the chlorotic leafspot virus.

There is a desperate need for enhanced understanding of the mechanisms of failure to mature and the optimal type and timing of interventions to promote maturity. Grafts are prone to frequent stenosis and thrombosis. Surveillance for graft stenosis with preemptive angioplasty may reduce graft thrombosis, but recent randomized clinical trials have questioned the efficacy of this <b>approach.</b> <b>Graft</b> stenosis results from aggressive neointimal hyperplasia, and pharmaco-logic approaches to slowing this process are being investigated in clinical trials. Catheters are prone to frequent thrombosis and infection. The optimal management of catheter-related bacteremia is a subject of ongoing debate. Prophylaxis of catheter-related bacteremia continues to generate important clinical research. Close collaboration among nephrologists, surgeons, radiologists, and the dialysis staff is required to optimize vascular access outcomes and can be expedited by having a dedicated access coordinator to streamline the process. The goal of this review is to provide an update on the current status of vascular access management...|$|R
40|$|In 132 {{consecutive}} pediatric liver transplants {{using all}} available technical variants, no patients had died at 6 months posttransplantation. Three-month and actual graft survival rates are 92 % and 86 %, respectively. Surgically, pediatric liver transplantation is <b>approaching</b> perfection.

40|$|A case is {{reported}} of a 34 year old white male with {{chronic renal failure}} secondary to glomerulonephritis who received four renal transplants {{over a period of}} five years. He died 25 months after the fourth transplant. Necropsy revealed a reticulum cell sarcoma-microglioma of the brain. The possibility that multiple transplants may have had a synergistic effect {{in the development of a}} malignant cerebral lymphoma in this patient is briefly discussed in the light of the current theories concerning the pathogenesis of the tumours in transplant recipients and in the context of the present therapeutic <b>approach</b> to <b>graft</b> rejection...|$|R
5000|$|Tympanoplasty can be {{performed}} through the ear canal (transcanal approach), through an incision in the ear (endaural approach) or through an incision behind the ear (postauricular <b>approach).</b> A <b>graft</b> may be taken to reconstruct the tympanic membrane. Common graft sites include the temporalis fascia and the tragus. The surgery takes ½ to 1 hour if done through the ear canal and 1 {{and a half to}} two hours if an incision is needed. It is done under local or general anesthesia. It is done on an inpatient or day case basis and is successful 85-90% of the time [...]|$|R
50|$|The {{combination}} of meniscus replacement and articular cartilage grafting led to Stone’s pursuit of biologic knee replacement, {{a technique to}} fully replace the damaged cartilage in the knee with natural tissues. This program is underway at The Stone Clinic and includes a stem cell with shell <b>graft</b> <b>approach</b> to replacing the articular cartilage surface of the knee.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} <b>approaches</b> to synthesizing <b>graft</b> copolymers. Usually they employ familiar polymerization techniques that are commonly used such as atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), anionic and cationic polymerizations, and free radical living polymerization. Some other less common polymerization include radiation-induced polymerization, ring-opening olefin metathesis polymerization, polycondensation reactions, and iniferter-induced polymerization.|$|R
40|$|IMGT, the {{international}} ImMunoGeneTics information system® ([URL] {{was created in}} 1989 at Montpellier, France. IMGT is a high quality integrated knowledge resource specialized in immunoglobulins (IG), T cell receptors (TR), major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of human and other vertebrates, and related proteins {{of the immune system}} (RPI) which belong to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) and MHC superfamily (MhcSF). IMGT provides a common access to standardized data from genome, proteome, genetics and three-dimensional structures. The accuracy and the consistency of IMGT data are based on IMGT-ONTOLOGY, a semantic specification of terms to be used in immunogenetics and immunoinformatics. IMGT-ONTOLOGY has been formalized using XML Schema (IMGT-ML) for interoperability with other information systems. We are developing Web services to automatically query IMGT databases and tools. This is the first step towards IMGT-Choreography which will trigger and coordinate dynamic interactions between IMGT Web services to process complex significant biological and clinical requests. IMGT-Choreography will further increase the IMGT leadership in immunogenetics and immunoinformatics for medical research (repertoire analysis of the IG antibody recognition sites and of the TR recognition sites in autoimmune and infectious diseases, AIDS, leukemias, lymphomas, myelomas), veterinary research (IG and TR repertoires in farm and wild life species), genome diversity and genome evolution studies of the adaptive immune responses, biotechnology related to antibody engineering (single chain Fragment variable (scFv), phage displays, combinatorial libraries, chimeric, humanized and human antibodies), diagnostics (detection and follow-up of residual diseases) and therapeutical <b>approaches</b> (<b>grafts,</b> immunotherapy, vaccinology). IMGT is freely available at [URL]...|$|R
