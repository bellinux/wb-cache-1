5|$|The Devonshire Park Theatre is <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> a Victorian theatre with ornate {{interior}} decorations, {{and plays}} host to touring dramas and comedies {{and an annual}} local pantomime. The Royal Hippodrome has the longest running summer show in Britain. The London Philharmonic Orchestra makes regular appearances and has an annual season at the Congress Theatre.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, Hooker's {{city hall}} was {{destroyed}} by fire and a new design was commissioned by Henry Richardson; the building opened in 1883. The new city hall still stands and is <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> Richardson's unique Romanesque style. Architectural critics consider the building to have been designed around {{the high point of}} Richardson's career. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 4, 1972.|$|E
5|$|It {{was then}} {{believed}} that a Saxon town known as Alvertune developed. In Pierre de Langtoft's history of King Alfred he writes that in 865 it {{was the site of}} a number of battles between King Elfrid and his brother Alfred and five Danish kings and a similar number of earls. Later, in the 10th century, Danes settled at Romanby and Brompton. <b>A</b> <b>fine</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> English stonecarving from the period, the Brompton Hogbacks, can be found in Brompton Parish Church.|$|E

5|$|New {{walls were}} built by Tarade and Vauban in the 17th century. They {{were in their}} turn {{destroyed}} in 1874. Only small portions survive: two bastions and the Porte de Strasbourg ("Strasbourg gate"), {{a good example of}} French architecture under Louis XIV. Sélestat still has two old arsenals, Sainte-Barbe on the main square (1470) and Saint-Hilaire (1518). The first, with a large crenelated gable, is <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> Gothic architecture.|$|E
5|$|Heather moor {{containing}} ling, bell heather, cross-leaved heath, {{bog myrtle}} and fescues is everywhere abundant. The high Black Cuillins weather too slowly {{to produce a}} soil that sustains a rich plant life, but each of the main peninsulas has an individual flora. The basalt underpinnings of Trotternish produce a diversity of Arctic and alpine plants including alpine pearlwort and mossy cyphal. The low-lying fields of Waternish contain corn marigold and corn spurry. The sea cliffs of Duirinish boast mountain avens and fir clubmoss. Minginish produces fairy flax, cats-ear and black bog rush. There is <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> Brachypodium-rich ash woodland at Tokavaig in Sleat incorporating silver birch, hazel, bird cherry, and hawthorn.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{opinion of}} the theatre is more generous, with English Heritage {{describing}} the building as both Phipps' finest work {{and one of the}} best planned theatres in London. The building was Grade II* listed in January 1970. Appreciation of the buildings came too late to save the adjacent hotel from redevelopment as the new High Commission for New Zealand, completed in 1963 by British architects Robert Matthew, Johnson Marshall and Partners, who also designed the Commonwealth Institute. In 1995, this too was Grade II listed as <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> 1960s architecture. The 200-year-old Royal Opera Arcade, built by Nash and Repton, is all that survives of the second theatre and is the earliest example of a London arcade.|$|E

The cathedral of Nancy, the Triumphal Arch and the [...] "Place de la Carriere" [...] are <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> 18th-century architecture. The Palace of the Dukes of Lorraine is the former princely residence of the rulers. The palace houses the Musée Lorrain.|$|R

5|$|The Church of San Benedetto in Catania (Illustrations 15 and 16) is <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> a Sicilian Baroque interior, {{decorated}} between 1726 and 1762, {{the period}} when Sicilian Baroque was {{at the height of}} its fashion and individuality. The ceilings were frescoed by the artist Giovanni Tuccari. The most spectacular part of the church's decoration is the nun's choir (Illustrations 16), created c. 1750, which was designed {{in such a way that}} the nuns' voices could be heard during services, but the nuns themselves were still quite separate from and unseen by the less spiritual world outside.|$|E
5|$|At Ostend, Vindictive did prevent larger {{warships}} {{passing through}} the channel, although smaller craft could still come and go at will. The larger warships in Bruges were trapped there for the remaining months of the war; the town was captured by the Allies in October 1918. The blockages at Ostend and Zeebrugge took several years to clear completely, not being totally removed until 1921. On a strategic scale {{the effects of the}} raids at Ostend and Zeebrugge on the battle of the Atlantic were negligible. Despite this, in Britain the Ostend Raid was feted as a success. Three Victoria Crosses and a host of lesser awards were given to the men involved. The Admiralty presented it as <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> daring and careful planning from the Royal Navy, providing a valuable morale boost at {{one of the most critical}} moments of the war.|$|E
5|$|Construction began around 1210 by Bishop Jocelin of Wells but principally {{dates from}} 1230. Bishop Jocelin {{continued}} the cathedral building campaign begun by Bishop Reginald Fitz Jocelin, and {{was responsible for}} building the Bishop's Palace, {{as well as the}} choristers' school, a grammar school, a hospital for travellers and a chapel within the liberty of the cathedral. He also built a manor house at Wookey, near Wells. The chapel and great hall were built between 1275 and 1292 for Bishop Robert Burnell. The windows had stone tracery. Stone bosses where the supporting ribs meet on the ceiling are covered with representations of oak leaves and the Green Man. The building is seen as <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> the Early English architectural style.|$|E

5|$|The parish {{church of}} St Peter & St Paul is {{situated}} in {{the centre of the}} town. A church has been on the site since at least 1162, although the current tower dates from 1352. The building had fallen into disrepair during the 19th century, and the majority of the building is the result of an intensive restoration in 1910. This included restoring a pitched roof and adding new aisles, although the nave arches are original. In 1935, a new two manual Harrison & Harrison organ was installed, <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> a pneumatic action instrument. Recent years have seen the construction of several new facilities, such as the Bricstan room extension. The church lists itself as being of the low church branch of the Church of England. The church also hosts the town's Catholic congregation.|$|E
