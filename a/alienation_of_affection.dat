25|$|In common-law countries, {{adultery}} {{was also}} known as criminal conversation. This became {{the name of the}} civil tort arising from adultery, being based upon compensation for the other spouse's injury. Criminal conversation was usually referred to by lawyers as crim. con., and was abolished in England in 1857, and the Republic of Ireland in 1976. Another tort, <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> <b>affection,</b> arises when one spouse deserts the other for a third person. This act was {{also known as}} desertion, which was often a crime as well. A small number of jurisdictions still allow suits for criminal conversation and/or <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> <b>affection.</b> In the United States, six states still maintain this tort.|$|E

50|$|<b>Alienation</b> <b>of</b> <b>affections</b> is {{a common}} law tort, {{abolished}} in many jurisdictions. Where it still exists, an action is brought by a deserted spouse against a third party alleged {{to be responsible for}} the failure of the marriage.

60|$|The encouragers of {{the first}} mob never {{intended}} matters should go this length, {{and the people in}} general expressed the utter detestation of this unparalleled outrage, and I wish they could be convinced what infinite hazard there is of the most terrible consequences from such demons, when they are let loose in a government where there is not constant authority at hand sufficient to suppress them. I am told the government here will make me a compensation for my own and my family's loss, which I think cannot be much less than £3,000 sterling. I am not sure that they will. If they should not, it will be too heavy for me, and I must humbly apply to his majesty in whose service I am a sufferer; but this, and a much greater sum would be an insufficient compensation for the constant distress and anxiety of mind I have felt for some time past, and must feel for months to come. You cannot conceive the wretched state we are in. Such is the resentment of the people against the Stamp-Duty, {{that there can be no}} dependence upon the General Court to take any steps to enforce, or rather advise, to the payment of it. On the other hand, such will be the effects of not submitting to it, that all trade must cease, all courts fall, and all authority be at an end. Must not the ministry be excessively embarrassed? On the one hand, it will be said, if concessions are made, the Parliament endanger the loss of their authority over the Colony: on the other hand, if external forces should be used, there seems to be danger of a total lasting <b>alienation</b> <b>of</b> <b>affection.</b> Is there no alternative?
