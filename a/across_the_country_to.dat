Each year during the Miller era, several thousand people traveled from <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> wager on and watch the horses. In 1953, Rosecroft's attendance of 192,585 was the highest among all harness tracks in Maryland. Owners, trainers, and drivers from across the United States moved their farms to Maryland in the 1950s following the opening of Rosecroft, hoping to compete with the best horses.|$|E
5|$|In Philadelphia, Maeser was {{commissioned}} by the church to develop pamphlets on basic church principles. After living there a few weeks, Maeser was called {{to serve as a}} missionary by the LDS Church to the German-speaking community of Philadelphia. Maeser spent some time in Virginia as part of his mission, where he earned keep for himself and his family by giving music lessons. Among Maeser's music students were the daughters of former United States President John Tyler. Maeser returned with Anna to Philadelphia, where he was called by the church to serve as conference president. Maeser and his family left Philadelphia in June 1860 and traveled <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> Salt Lake City in Patriarch John Smith's company. Maeser arrived in Utah Territory on September 1, 1860.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, as mass {{civil disobedience}} broke out due to discontent from the Buddhist {{majority}} over Diệm's pro-Catholic discrimination, {{sparked by the}} fatal shootings of nine people who were demonstrating against the ban on the Buddhist flag. The US began to lose confidence in Diệm's ability to run the country effectively and prevent {{the growth of the}} communist insurgency, and concluded that he was an obstacle to religious and thus national stability. During this time, the American press corps wrote unvarnished stories about the South Vietnamese government's policies and actions, in contrast to the supportive pieces of the 1950s, and Diệm's attempt to physically intimidate correspondents backfired. After Diệm tried to settle the Buddhist crisis by launching synchronized raids on Buddhist temples <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> round up those monks who were leading protests against him, the Americans began to look for alternative leadership, sending Cable 243 to their embassy in Saigon to authorise the search for someone to replace Diệm. In November 1963, Diệm was overthrown in a US-backed coup and he and Nhu were captured and executed.|$|E

5|$|In a {{prototype}} from the series, Alphonse's soul was sealed in a flying squirrel instead of armor {{as a result}} of human transmutation. He appeared as the father to the other protagonist, Edward, in their searching for a way to recover their bodies. To match the designs from the manga magazine Monthly Shōnen Gangan, the two characters were redesigned. Alphonse was given a huge suit of armor to contrast him with Edward's short stature. Since Alphonse mostly appears with his armor, Arakawa tends to make sketches of his human form so that she would not forget how to draw him. Some events from the Elrics' lives are social problems she integrated into the plot. Their journey <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> help people is meant to gain an understanding of the meaning of family. As Alphonse is mostly seen with his armor, during various chapters from the manga Arakawa was unable to draw him crying. During Chapter 40, Arakawa saw his conversation with Edward as a way to let him express his feeling and to make him appear as though he is crying. When comparing the two brothers during the time Alphonse obtained the ability to use alchemy without a circle like Edward, Arakawa stated nobody was better at alchemy as the two had different preferences {{in the same way as}} other alchemists appearing in the series. When making omakes, Arakawa tends to draw Alphonse doing something comical to contrast him with the other characters. She states that she does it because Alphonse may enjoy making fun of other people.|$|E
5|$|The twin {{impacts of}} hurricanes Ingrid and Manuel {{prompted}} officials in Mexico {{to declare a}} state of emergency in 155municipalities in Veracruz, Tamaulipas, Chiapas, Oaxaca, Guerrero, and Chihuahua. The nation's Health Ministry sent medical crews <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> affected areas in an effort {{to prevent the spread of}} disease; the agency also suggested residents boil their water. Officials opened shelters in Tamaulipas for residents whose houses were damaged, housing about 2,000people in the weeks following the storm. The Mexican food bank sent about 800tons of food to the hardest-hit parts of the country in Guerrero, Veracruz, and Sinaloa. In addition, the Mexican Red Cross delivered 186tons of food to Veracruz alone. Volunteers delivered about 600blankets and various cleaning supplies to the town of Pánuco. Following the storms, the National Civil Protection Coordination received the authority to prevent housing construction in areas at risk for mudslides and flooding; the law had passed in 2012, but initially lacked the authority to enforce it. Some residents in Tamaulipas complained at the slow pace of receiving aid. In response, the Gulf Cartel brought relief items to Aldama, with one columnist for El Universal suggesting that this was to gain favor with local residents.|$|E
5|$|To gain {{political}} power in favor of prohibition legislation, a state Prohibition Party was formed in 1884; however, it {{was never able to}} effectively mobilize a significant force of voters within the state. Many temperance advocates continued to work within the more established political parties. The liquor issue pitted wets and drys in stable uncompromising coalitions that formed a main theme of Hoosier politics into the 1930s. One legislative success occurred in 1895, when the state legislature passed the Nicholson law, a local option law authored by S. E. Nicholson, a Quaker minister who served in the state legislature and was a leader of the national Anti-Saloon League. The League became a {{political power}}house, mobilizing pietistic Protestant voters (that is, members of the major denominations except Lutherans and Episcopalians) to support dry legislation. The Nicholson law allowed voters in a city or township to file a remonstrance that would prevent an individual saloon owner from acquiring a liquor license. Additional legislative efforts to extend the Nicholson law and achieve statewide prohibition in Indiana would not occur until the early twentieth century. One of the leading supporters for the temperance movement in Indiana was Emma Barrett Molloy, who was {{an active member of the}} WCTU and lectured <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>to</b> promote the ban of alcohol. Through her vocal activism in temperance and prohibition, Molloy also entered into the women's suffrage sphere as a strong supported for women's rights, particularly freedom of speech.|$|E
