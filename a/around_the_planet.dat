5|$|The {{rings of}} Uranus {{are thought to}} be {{relatively}} young, and not more than 600million years old. The Uranian ring system probably originated from the collisional fragmentation of several moons that once existed <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet.</b> After colliding, the moons probably broke up into many particles, which survived as narrow and optically dense rings only in strictly confined zones of maximum stability.|$|E
5|$|High-altitude clouds on Neptune {{have been}} {{observed}} casting shadows on the opaque cloud deck below. There are also high-altitude cloud bands that wrap <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> at constant latitude. These circumferential bands have widths of 50–150km and lie about 50–110km above the cloud deck. These altitudes are in the layer where weather occurs, the troposphere.

5|$|During its flyby of Amalthea, the Galileo orbiter's star scanner {{detected}} nine flashes {{that appear}} to be small moonlets near the orbit of Amalthea. Because they were sighted only from one location, their true distances could not be measured. These moonlets may be anywhere in size from gravel to stadium-sized. Their origins are unknown, but they may be gravitationally captured into current orbit or they may be ejecta from meteor impacts on Amalthea. On the next and final orbit (just an hour before destruction), Galileo detected one more such moonlet. However, this time Amalthea {{was on the other side}} of the planet, so it is probable that the particles form a ring <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> near Amalthea's orbit.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 an {{exoplanet}} (47 UMa b) {{was announced}} in orbit around 47 Ursae Majoris by Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler. The discovery was made by observing the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum corresponding {{to changes in the}} star's radial velocity as the planet's gravity pulled it <b>around.</b> <b>The</b> <b>planet</b> was the first long-period extrasolar planet discovered. Unlike the majority of known such planets, it has a low-eccentricity orbit. The planet is at least 2.53 times the mass of Jupiter and takes 1,078 days or 2.95 years to orbit its star. If it were to be located in the Solar System, it would lie between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Jet Force Gemini {{revolves}} around the Jet Force Gemini team attempting to defeat the dark insectoid tyrant Mizar and his horde of drones. The team is composed of Juno, Vela, and their wardog mascot Lupus. The game begins with the three characters in orbit <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> Goldwood after barely escaping {{the destruction of the}} entire Jet Force fleet at the hands of Mizar, who has been capturing and enslaving a race of survivors known as the Tribals. When Juno, Vela and Lupus are attacked by several drones, the three decide to abandon their ship and go off on their own separate paths to stop the invasion. Ultimately, the heroes find themselves reunited at Mizar's Palace and face to face with Mizar, who escapes to a nearby asteroid where he sets course to impact with Earth. To help the heroes, Tribals leader King Jeff provides them with an ancient starship that can quickly catch up to Mizar's asteroid. In return, the team must rescue all the Tribals throughout the galaxy.|$|E
50|$|In 1764, Benjamin Martin {{devised a}} new type of {{planetary}} model, in which <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> were carried on brass arms leading from a series of concentric or coaxial tubes. With this construction it was difficult to make <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> revolve, and to get the moons to turn <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>planets.</b> Martin suggested that the conventional orrery should consist of three parts: the planetarium where <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> revolved <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Sun, the tellurion (also tellurian or tellurium) which showed the inclined axis of the Earth and how it revolved <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Sun, and the lunarium which showed the eccentric rotations of <b>the</b> Moon <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Earth. In one orrery, these three motions could be mounted on a common table, separately using the central spindle as a prime mover.|$|R

50|$|The gap in {{the disk}} leads to the {{conclusion}} of a protoplanet in formation <b>around</b> <b>the</b> star. <b>The</b> <b>planet</b> {{does not have to be}} in the gap, however. It could either be sweeping up the dust and rocks from the disk as it travels in its orbit <b>around</b> <b>the</b> star, or the gravity of <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> could knock <b>the</b> dust out of one part of the disk.|$|R
5|$|Jupiter's {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} {{is generated by}} electrical currents in the planet's outer core, which is composed of liquid metallic hydrogen. Volcanic eruptions on Jupiter's moon Io eject large amounts of sulfur dioxide gas into space, forming a large torus <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet.</b> Jupiter's magnetic field forces the torus to rotate with the same angular velocity and direction as the planet. The torus in turn loads the magnetic field with plasma, in the process stretching it into a pancake-like structure called a magnetodisk. In effect, Jupiter's magnetosphere is shaped by Io's plasma and its own rotation, {{rather than by the}} solar wind like Earth's magnetosphere. Strong currents in the magnetosphere generate permanent aurorae around the planet's poles and intense variable radio emissions, which means that Jupiter {{can be thought of as}} a very weak radio pulsar. Jupiter's aurorae have been observed in almost all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, including infrared, visible, ultraviolet and soft X-rays.|$|E
5|$|Metroid II is an action-adventure game {{in which}} the player {{controls}} the protagonist Samus Aran on the fictional planet SR388. In this side-scroller, players advance through the game by using Samus' weapons to kill a fixed number of Metroid creatures. The player is given a detector that displays the number of Metroids remaining in the area. Once all the creatures are eliminated, an earthquake occurs and the planet's lava levels decrease, allowing Samus to travel deeper through its tunnels. The Metroid creatures are encountered in different evolution stages of their development cycle: original, Alpha, Gamma, Zeta and Omega. The more developed the organism is, the stronger its attack. Metroid II features save modules located <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet,</b> which allow players to save their progress and continue in another session.|$|E
5|$|The first {{mention of}} rings around Neptune {{dates back to}} 1846 when William Lassell, the {{discoverer}} of Neptune's largest moon, Triton, thought {{he had seen a}} ring <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet.</b> However, his claim was never confirmed and it is likely that it was an observational artifact. The first reliable detection of a ring was made in 1968 by stellar occultation, although that result would go unnoticed until 1977 when the rings of Uranus were discovered. Soon after the Uranus discovery, a team from Villanova University led by Harold J. Reitsema began searching for rings around Neptune. On 24 May 1981, they detected a dip in a star's brightness during one occultation; however, {{the manner in which the}} star dimmed did not suggest a ring. Later, after the Voyager fly-by, it was found that the occultation was due to the small Neptunian moon Larissa, a highly unusual event.|$|E
40|$|The {{motions of}} the {{abundant}} small particulate matter in the early solar system are discussed.

40|$|The recent {{discovery}} of a Jupiter-mass <b>planet</b> in <b>the</b> close binary star system HD 188753 poses a problem for planet formation theory. A circumstellar disk <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet’s</b> parent star would be truncated at 1. 3 AU, leaving little material available for planet formation. In this paper, we attempt to model a disk around HD 188753, exploring a range of parameters constrained by observations of protoplanetary disks. We find that the in situ formation of <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> <b>around</b> HD 188753 is extremely unlikely, and that <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> must have formed before the capture of the close stellar companion...|$|R

5|$|The {{heads-up display}} shows Samus's health, the supply mode for Reserve Tanks, icons that {{represent}} weapons, and a map display showing her location and its surroundings. The inventory screen allows the player to enable and disable weapons and abilities. While the beam weapon can be combined, the Spazer and Plasma beams {{cannot be used}} simultaneously. The backup units called Reserve Tanks can be used automatically when Samus's health is depleted. The game also features an automap to help players navigate the {{different areas of the}} game. Additionally, the player can use the map computer found in each part of the planet to reveal unexplored areas. To save their progress, the player must find and use one of the save stations scattered <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet.</b> The game can also be saved at Samus's gunship, which fully recharges her health and ammunition as well. Super Metroid has three endings based on the time taken to complete the game, which determine whether Samus poses with or without her suit. The best ending is achieved when the game is completed under three hours.|$|E
