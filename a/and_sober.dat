5|$|Birdsong first {{appeared}} with the Supremes in Ballard's {{place at a}} benefit concert at the Hollywood Bowl on April 29, 1967. Following the performance, Gordy quickly learned that Birdsong was still contractually committed to the Blue Belles when that group's lawyers filed an injunction against him. In May, Ballard returned for what she believed was a probationary period, although in reality it was a stopgap measure until Gordy {{was able to buy}} out Birdsong's contract. During May and June, knowing that she was one step away from being dismissed, Ballard made an attempt to toe the line, slimming down and showing up to commitments on time <b>and</b> <b>sober.</b> Despite this, Birdsong was secretly traveling with the Supremes, studying their routines.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year the band recorded their last album with Richie, Halfway to Sanity. Richie left in August 1987, upset that {{after being in}} the band for five years, the other members would still not give him {{a share of the}} money they made selling T-shirts. Richie was replaced by Clem Burke from Blondie, which was disbanded at the time. According to Johnny, the performances with Burke—who adopted the name Elvis Ramone—were a disaster. He was fired after two performances (August 28 & 29, 1987) because his drumming could not keep up {{with the rest of the}} band. In September, Marky, now clean <b>and</b> <b>sober,</b> returned to the band.|$|E
5|$|Rainie {{returns to}} Walford in 2010 and tells Max she is clean <b>and</b> <b>sober,</b> and asks Max for Tanya's phone number. Tanya's daughter, Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald), wants Rainie {{to stay and}} Max agrees. She steals money out of Max's sister Carol Jackson's (Lindsey Coulson) purse, which she uses to buy crack cocaine. Max catches her with the drugs and throws her out. She starts looking for her drugs where a drunken Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) approaches, finds Rainie's crack cocaine and is tempted to try some after she says it helps her block out her memories. Phil and Rainie get high at Phil's home. Rainie goes to get more drugs when Phil steals money from The Queen Victoria public house, but is mugged by a drug dealer. Phil's girlfriend Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) offers {{to help him get}} clean but throws Rainie out of the house, calling her pathetic.|$|E
5|$|The 1969 {{tour was}} a three Test series. The captains were Ray Illingworth for England <b>and</b> <b>Sobers</b> for the West Indies. The West Indies had an ageing team <b>and,</b> with <b>Sobers</b> {{suffering}} {{a loss of}} form, were always the weaker side.|$|R

25|$|In 2001, {{at the age}} of 35, Slash was {{diagnosed}} with cardiomyopathy, a form of congestive heart failure caused by his many years of alcohol and drug abuse. Originally given between six days and six weeks to live, he survived through physical therapy and the implantation of a defibrillator. Slash has been clean <b>and</b> <b>sober</b> since 2005, which he credits to his then-wife Ferrar. In 2009, following his mother's death from lung cancer, he quit smoking.|$|E

2500|$|West Indies (500 {{for nine}} declared) beat England (240 and 205) by an innings and 55 runs. An {{overwhelming}} victory {{with more than}} a day to spare was built on a fifth wicket stand of 265 between Nurse, who made 137, <b>and</b> <b>Sobers</b> (174). England suffered from the West Indian pace attack [...] in Milburn's case literally so, for he was forced to retire hurt after a blow to the elbow. Not until D'Oliveira (88) and Higgs (49) came together at 83 for six was there resistance, <b>and</b> <b>Sobers</b> took five for 41. It was a similar story in the follow-on, with Bob Barber reaching 55 but otherwise only the injured Milburn passing 40. Gibbs took six for 39 <b>and</b> <b>Sobers,</b> mostly bowling spin, a further three to finish with match figures of eight for 80 to go with his 174.|$|R

25|$|Though he {{has managed}} to remain clean <b>and</b> <b>sober</b> for {{extended}} periods in recent years, Osbourne has frequently commented on his former wild lifestyle, puzzled at how he has survived 40years of drug and alcohol abuse. Upon being fired from Black Sabbath in 1979, Osbourne spent the next three months locked in his hotel room taking vast amounts of alcohol and other drugs all day, every day. He claims that he would certainly have died if his future wife Sharon had not offered to manage him as a solo artist.|$|E
25|$|After a {{performance}} in Winter Park, Florida, on March 4, 1986, Manuel committed suicide, aged 42, in his motel room. He had suffered {{for many years}} from alcoholism and drug addiction, and had been clean <b>and</b> <b>sober</b> for several years beginning in 1978, but had begun drinking and using drugs again by 1984. Manuel's position as pianist was filled by old friend Stan Szelest (who died not long after), and then by Richard Bell. Bell had played with Ronnie Hawkins after {{the departure of the}} original Hawks, and was best known from his days as a member of Janis Joplin's Full Tilt Boogie Band.|$|E
25|$|This {{one story}} {{building}} {{is a very good}} example of Neoclassic style in Ponce and the only one single-story building in the area. It preserves its simple lines typical of the 19th century institutional or military construction in the Island. Contributing elements to the style are its massive <b>and</b> <b>sober</b> exterior elements consisting of wide walls and pilasters crowned with tuscan order capitols, planar window surrounds, and a set of steps giving access to the main portico which projects form the main facade. A simple cornice crowns the building in all facades. Series of arched windows originally closed by wood louvers and glass panel transomes, complete the facade (these windows were replaced with metal blinds in the mid-1960s and have been vandalized in recent years).|$|E

25|$|Franz Joseph was passionately in {{love with}} his wife, but she did not {{reciprocate}} his feelings fully and felt increasingly stifled by the rigidness of court life. He was an unimaginative <b>and</b> <b>sober</b> man, a political reactionary who was still guided by his mother and her adherence to the strict Spanish Court Ceremonial (Spanisches Hofzeremoniell) regarding both his public and domestic life, whereas Elisabeth inhabited a different world altogether. Restless to the point of hyperactivity, naturally introverted, and emotionally distant from her husband, she fled him as well as her duties of life at court, avoiding them both as much as she could. He indulged her wanderings, but constantly and unsuccessfully tried to tempt her into a more domestic life with him.|$|E
25|$|Chris Rene's journey {{began in}} June 2011 when he auditioned for the debut {{season of the}} US version of The X Factor. By then, Rene was just 70 days clean <b>and</b> <b>sober,</b> fresh out of a Santa Cruz {{rehabilitation}} center from a drug and alcohol addiction. Rene ultimately finished the season in third place, behind runner-up Josh Krajcik and winner Melanie Amaro, though Rene {{proved to be a}} memorable and influential figure from the show. Rene, along with season one The X Factor winner Melanie Amaro, and fellow finalists Marcus Canty and Astro, were signed to mentor L.A. Reid's revamped label Epic Records in December 2011, a day after the X-Factor finale. Rene's contract would reportedly be worth $150,000 to $500,000 with the label, which stands to reason since he finished in third place.|$|E
25|$|Wilson began {{a public}} {{campaign}} for the nomination in the South, with {{a speech to the}} Pewter Platter Club in Norfolk, Virginia. While he was received enthusiastically, the speech, reformist in nature, was considered provocative and radical by the conservative audience, making the visit on the whole less than positive. However, as Wilson was the first Southerner to have a serious chance at the White House since 1848, Southern Democrats in general strongly supported Wilson's {{campaign for the}} nomination in 1912. More of Wilson's support came from young progressives in that region, including intellectuals, editors and lawyers. Wilson managed to maneuver through the complexities of local politics. For example, in Tennessee the Democratic Party was divided over Prohibition; Wilson was progressive <b>and</b> <b>sober,</b> but not dry, and appealed to both sides. They united behind him to win the presidential election in the state, but divided over state politics and lost the gubernatorial election.|$|E

25|$|After {{watching}} his embarrassing birthday party video and being mocked by his friends with gag gifts, Barney finally sees he is a hideous drunk, and he promises to get sober. At first, he finds sustaining sobriety tough, but he finds {{his way to}} an AA meeting with Homer's help. Meanwhile, to get their picture {{on the cover of}} the new phone book, Bart and Lisa decide to enter an amateur photo contest. In the closet, they find an old camera and start to take snapshots. Elsewhere, Barney makes plans to change his life now that he is clean <b>and</b> <b>sober.</b> The Springfield Flight School is his first stop, where he takes helicopter-flying lessons. At Moe's Tavern, Homer is treated as the new Barney and is forced by Moe, Lenny and Carl to perform drunken antics. Barney gives Homer a ride in the helicopter a few lessons later. While in the air, the two men fight about Barney's new sobriety and Homer's unhappiness that they no longer have ridiculous adventures.|$|E
25|$|A {{review meeting}} {{was held in}} May 2008, {{approximately}} 8 months after the restrictions began, which was attended by the Director of Liquor Licensing {{and members of the}} Aboriginal community. Oscar said the meeting was ‘the most important mins of our lives’. The views of people who attended were that women now felt more empowered, confident and able to participate in community-level discussions, the Valley was a much more quiet and safe place to live, and other Aboriginal communities had noticed the positive example set in the Valley. Alcohol restrictions had encouraged government and non-government agencies to become more involved, a strong desire to not return to the chaos of pre-restriction times prevailed, and change needed to be substantial and long lasting. The people felt priority needed to be given to children’s health and welfare, and they wanted the next generation of children to be raised without alcohol affecting their lives, families were stronger <b>and</b> <b>sober,</b> old people were being cared for, young people were thinking about buying homes, and children were learning new skills. They also believed sly grogging had become an issue, communities with people suffering from FASD needed help, and if the restrictions were lifted, all of the confidence that now existed in the community would be ‘stripped away’.|$|E
25|$|A {{search of}} her lodgings yielded {{a series of}} bizarre and clearly {{delusional}} letters in which she {{claimed to be the}} rightful heir to the throne. The newspapers assumed that Nicholson's insanity was brought on by melancholia over her lover's desertion. She was examined in the chamber of the Board of Green Cloth by Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer William Pitt the Younger, Home Secretary Lord Sydney, Foreign Secretary Lord Carmarthen, Sir Francis Drake, and Mr. Justice Addington. It was discovered that in July she had sent petitions to the King regarding her claim to the throne. In her reply to questions from Addington, she claimed to be a virgin, but also claimed to be the mother of Lords Mansfield and Loughborough, both of whom were older than she was. Her landlord, a stationer called Jonathan Fiske, stated that she was industrious <b>and</b> <b>sober,</b> and earned her living at needlework, making mantuas. She denied wanting to assassinate the King, and said she only intended to scare him. The noted physician Dr John Munro, who was already well known for his testimony in the murder trial of Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers, certified her insane and she was committed to Bethlem Royal Hospital for life under the Vagrancy Act 1744 on the order of the Home Secretary, Lord Sydney. She died there 42 years later.|$|E

25|$|The bourgeois, {{or members}} {{of the middle class}} of Paris, financiers, merchants, shopkeepers, artisans, and those in the liberal professions (doctors, lawyers, accountants, teachers, {{government}} officials) were a growing social class. They were specifically defined by law as persons who had lived in the city at least a year in their own residence, and earned enough money to pay taxes. In 1780, there were an estimated 25,000 Paris households who fell into this category, about fourteen percent of the total. Many of those in the upper middle class rose from modest social origins to amass very large fortunes. Many of the wealthiest bourgeois built their own palatial town houses in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, in the Montmartre quarter, the banking center of the city, or close to the Palais Royal. The upper middle class, once they had made their fortunes, frequently lived by buying the debts and collecting rentes from the nobility and the government, which during the 18th century were both always short of cash. While the nobles tended to dress in rich and elaborate costumes and bright colors, the bourgeois wore rich fabrics but dark <b>and</b> <b>sober</b> colors. The bourgeois played a very active role in each neighborhood; they were the leaders of the religious confréries which organized charitable and religious activities for each profession, managed the finances of the parish churches, and ran the corporations which governed each profession in Paris.|$|E
