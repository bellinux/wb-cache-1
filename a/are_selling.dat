Naidu had enthusiastically described the Bazaar with merchants and vendors selling diverse range of wares.

The poet describes the experience of conversation between the seller and the buyer, here the poet questions the sellers about what they <b>are</b> <b>selling</b> and who in turn politely answer while explaining their products.
