5|$|Dusten Brown is {{a member}} of the Cherokee Nation. Brown served in the United States Army at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Christina Maldonado was a non-Indian single mother of two. Brown and Maldonado became engaged to be married in December 2008, and Maldonado {{informed}} Brown that she was pregnant in January 2009. On learning that Maldonado was pregnant, Brown began to press her to go ahead and marry him, and refused to provide any financial support until after the two had married. In May 2009, Maldonado broke off the engagement by text message and cut all communications with Brown. In June, Maldonado sent Brown a text message asking if he would rather pay child support or relinquish his parental rights. Brown responded via text message that he relinquished his rights. No child support order was in place at this time. Furthermore, while laws vary from state to state, it is generally impossible for <b>any</b> <b>parent,</b> male or female, to surrender their parental rights without a court hearing that determines the best interest of the child. A father cannot terminate his parental rights by contract, much less by more informal means (such as by text message).|$|E

[...] In a review of the book in Library Journal, Linda Beck commented: [...] "This book is excellent owing to its whistle-blowing approach: it exposes an unregulated industry and alerts adults to the severe harm inflicted by these 'schools.'"

It's wishful and imparts the idea that, 'I'm here and I'm watching you take your steps forward and I'm supporting your independence, {{but at the same}} time, I don't want you to make mistakes.' <b>Any</b> <b>parent</b> can relate to that." [...] The song is followed by Eddie Vedder's acoustic ballad [...] "Skipping", which he wrote as a tribute to his children and features his daughter Olivia's (age 6) voice {{at the start of the}} track, saying [...] "check, check" [...] and [...] "daddy, daddy". Turlington said of Vedder's involvement: Eddie was amazing to accept this project while in the midst of so much. I spoke to him and exchanged several emails about his contribution. [...] "Skipping" [...] is such a sweet song and I just love that his daughter Olivia has a little cameo at the start. He once wrote me saying that his girls would be proud one day that their dad contributed to such a meaningful project.|$|E

2500|$|Proponents of childfreedom posit that {{choosing}} not to {{have children}} is no more or less selfish than choosing to have children. Choosing to have children may be the more selfish choice, especially when poor parenting risks creating many long term problems for both the children themselves and society at large. As philosopher David Benatar explains, {{at the heart of}} the decision to bring a child into the world often lies the parents' own desires (to enjoy child-rearing or perpetuate one's legacy/genes), rather than the potential person's interests. [...] At very least, Benatar believes this illustrates why a childfree person may be just as altruistic as <b>any</b> <b>parent.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Nina Wadia has praised Womack and Wallace {{for their}} [...] "acting skills" [...] during the storyline.

It's portraying fictional characters!" [...] Marc Elliott added: [...] "The storyline got whipped up into a massive frenzy. It's not {{representative}} in any way, shape or form of mothers {{who have lost their}} babies." [...] EastEnders actress Patsy Palmer has also praised the plot for its [...] "great acting". In an interview with Take It Easy, asked whether the show's bosses handled the storyline well, Palmer replied: [...] "I think they did. I know there's been loads of bad press, but something like that {{is always going to be}} sad to watch and it will upset people. But at the end of the day, it's a drama and it's not real. I think it got blown out of all proportion. Unfortunately, things like that do happen in real life. Babies get swapped and snatched in hospitals. I'm sure that <b>any</b> <b>parent</b> who has lost a child will find even talking about their experience very difficult, let alone watching it being acted out on television. Even my daughter got upset but she is only 9 so maybe I shouldn't have let her watch it. I just didn't realise it was going to be so heart-wrenching, which was down to the great acting." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1930s, {{the family}} {{acquired}} {{and moved to}} Sissinghurst Castle, near Cranbrook, Kent. Sissinghurst had once been owned by Vita's ancestors, which gave it a dynastic attraction to her after her father had disinherit her from Knole and his title. There the couple created the famous gardens that are now run by the National Trust. One of Vita's male suitors was Henry Lascelles, who would later marry the Princess Royal and become the 6th Earl of Harewood. Vita Sackville-West also had a passionate affair between 1929 and 1931 with Hilda Matheson, head of the BBC Talks Department. She called Hilda by the pet name of [...] "Stoker" [...] during their liaison. In 1931, Sackville-West was in a ménage à trois with journalist Evelyn Irons, who had interviewed her after her novel The Edwardians was published and became a best-seller, and Irons's lover, Olive Rinder. Sackville-West's 1932 novel Family History {{is the first of}} her books to raise the subject of lesbianism, albeit in an oblique form where the 24-year old heroine Evelyn Jerrold has more than familial feelings of love for her teenage niece Ruth. Jerrold, ashamed of feelings for Ruth, tries to destroy them by marrying a man named Miles Vane-Merrick, who she accidentally destroys by demanding more and more from him as she cannot bring herself to admit to her love for Ruth or see that Vane-Merrick cannot be a substitute for Ruth. The characters of Viola and Leonard Anquetil in Family History who are socialists, pacifists and feminists are thinly veiled versions of Virginia and Leonard Woolf. In Orlando, Woolf allowed Sackville-West to finally [...] "own" [...] Knole, and in Family History, she returns the favor as the Anquetils have children who are intelligent and decent people whom <b>any</b> <b>parent</b> could be proud of. Woolf never had children and was afraid that she would have been a bad mother if she did, so Sackville-West, in having her fictional alter-ego be an excellent mother {{was meant to be a}} [...] "gift" [...] to Woolf. Though Sackville-West regarded Nicolson's involvement with Sir Oswald Mosley's New Party (soon to be renamed the British Union of Fascists) as [...] "unfortunate", an angry Woolf wrote her in August 1931: [...] "Potto [...] expiring. What about Harold and Mosley? But don't write if it hurts". In the 1930s, Woolf and Sackville-West clashed over the question of pacifism as Sackville-West supported rearmament while Woolf remained loyal to her pacifism, leading to an end of their relationship in 1935.|$|E
