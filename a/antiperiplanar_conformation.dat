50|$|An {{extension}} of the anomeric effect, the exo anomeric effect is the preference of substituents coming off a ring to adopt the gauche conformation, while sterics would suggest an <b>antiperiplanar</b> <b>conformation</b> would be preferred. An {{example of this is}} 2-methoxytetrahydropyran. As the anomeric effect predicts, the methoxy substituent shows an increased preference for the axial conformation. However, there is actually more than one possible axial conformation due to rotation about the C-O bond between the methoxy substituent and the ring. When one applies the principles of the reverse anomeric effect, it can be predicted that the gauche conformer is preferred, suggesting the top left conformation is best in the figure above. This prediction is supported by experimental evidence. Furthermore, this preference for the gauche position is still seen in the equatorial conformation.|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} of â-hydrogen elimination from alkoxy and alkyl groups bound to a Cu(111) surface have been coupled with computational studies of gas-phase analogues to {{provide insight into}} the transition state for catalytic hydrogenation and dehydrogenation on metal surfaces. Previous studies have shown that fluorination increases the activation barrier (¢Eact) to â-hydrogen elimination in ethoxy groups (RCH 2 O(ad) f RCHdO(ad) + H(ad), where R) CH 3, CFH 2, CHF 2, CF 3) and propyl groups (RCH 2 CH 2,(ad) f RCHdCH 2,(ad) + H(ad), where R) CH 3, CF 3) on the Cu(111) surface. The increase in barrier height with increasing fluorination was attributed to the inductive influence of fluorine, which energetically destabilizes a hydride-like transition state of the form [RCä+âââHä-]‡. In this paper, deuterium kinetic isotope effects (DKIE) show that fluorination does not alter the mechanism for â-hydrogen elimination from ethoxy groups. Furthermore, the DKIE measurements confirm that the effects of fluorine on the kinetics of â-hydrogen elimination do not result from the change in mass when hydrogen is substituted by fluorine. A systematic study of fluorine substitution of surface-bound isopropoxy groups reveals combined steric and electronic effects. An excellent correlation is found between the ¢Eact for â-hydrogen elimination in adsorbed alkoxy groups and the calculated reaction energetics (¢Hrxn) for gas-phase dehydrogenation of fluorinated alcohols in trans <b>antiperiplanar</b> <b>conformations</b> (e. g., RCH 2 OH(g) f RCHdO(g) + H 2,(g), where the hydroxyl hydrogen is antiperiplanar to a carbon and the oxygen is antiperiplanar to a fluorine).

40|$|US National Science Foundation [CHE- 105 - 5310, CHE- 105 - 7466]The {{conventional}} {{view that}} the sigma(CC) and sigma(CH) bonds in alkanes and unsaturated hydrocarbons are so highly localized that their non-steric interactions are negligible is scrutinized by the block-localized wavefunction (BLW) method. Even molecules considered conventionally to be "strain free" and "unperturbed" have surprisingly large and quite significant total sigma-BLW-delocalization energies (DEs) due to their geminal and vicinal hyperconjugative interactions. Thus, the computed BLW-DEs (in kcal mol(- 1)) for the <b>antiperiplanar</b> <b>conformations</b> of the n-alkanes (CNH 2 N+ 2, N= 1 - 10) range from 11. 6 for ethane to 82. 2 for n-decane and are 50. 9 for cyclohexane and 91. 0 for adamantane. Although sigma-electron delocalization in unsaturated hydrocarbons usually is ignored, the sigma-BLW-DEs (in kcal mol(- 1)) are substantial, as exemplified by D- 2 h ethylene (9. 0), triplet D- 2 d ethylene (16. 4), allene (19. 3), butadiene (19. 0), hexatriene (28. 3), benzene (28. 1), and cyclobutadiene (21. 1). While each individual geminal and vicinal hyperconjugative interaction between hydrocarbon sigma-bonding and sigma-antibonding orbitals tends to be smaller than an individual p conjugative interaction (e. g., 10. 2 kcal mol(- 1) in anti- 1, 3 -butadiene, the presence of many sigma-hyperconjugative interactions (e. g., a total of 12 in anti- 1, 3 -butadiene, see text), result in substantial total sigma-stabilization energies (e. g., 19. 0 kcal mol(- 1) for butadiene), which may surpass those from the pi interactions. Although large in magnitude, sigma-electron delocalization energies often are obscured by cancellation when two hydrocarbons are compared. Rather than being strain-free, cyclohexane, adamantane, and diamantane suffer from their increasing number of intramolecular 1, 4 -C center dot center dot center dot C repulsions resulting in elongated C-C bond lengths and reduced sigma-hyperconjugation, compared to the (skew-free) antiperiplanar n-alkane conformers.

40|$|Single crystal X-ray {{diffraction}} {{reveals that}} 4, 4 '-bis(tetrahydrothiopyranyl) crystallizes in an equatorial-equatorial geometry with a gauche conformation along the central carbon-carbon bond. B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 G** and MP 2 / 6 - 311 G** calculations {{show that the}} <b>antiperiplanar</b> <b>conformation</b> is higher in energy than the gauche one because of sulfur induced stretching and widening of the cyclohexane-like rings. Calculations at various levels of theory suggest that in the antiperiplanar region the twisting coordinate of 4, 4 '-bis(tetrahydrothiopyranyl) exhibits a very shallow double-well potential. The gauche molecular structure of 4, 4 '-bis(tetrahydrothiopyranyl) thwarts efficient packing of its molecules in the solid state. Crown Copyright 2012 Published by Elsevier B. V.
