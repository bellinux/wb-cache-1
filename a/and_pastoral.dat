5|$|Before and After Science is {{the fifth}} studio album by British {{musician}} Brian Eno. Produced by Eno and Rhett Davies, it was originally released by Polydor Records in December 1977 in the UK and by US Island soon after. Guest musicians from the United Kingdom and Germany helped with the album, including members of Roxy Music, Free, Fairport Convention, Can and Cluster. Over one hundred tracks were written with only ten making the album's final cut. The musical styles of the album range from energetic and jagged to more languid <b>and</b> <b>pastoral.</b>|$|E

5|$|For Marquee Moon, Verlaine {{and fellow}} guitarist Richard Lloyd {{abandoned}} contemporary punk rock's power chords {{in favor of}} rock and jazz-inspired interplay, melodic lines, and counter-melodies. Verlaine's lyrics combined urban <b>and</b> <b>pastoral</b> imagery, references to lower Manhattan, themes of adolescence, and influences from French poetry. He also used puns and double-entendres to give his songs an impressionistic quality describing the perception of an experience rather than its specific details.|$|E
5|$|The {{delineation}} of the Riverina {{region by}} {{government agencies and}} other bodies varies, but in common usage it generally comprises the agricultural <b>and</b> <b>pastoral</b> areas of New South Wales, west of the Great Dividing Range and in the drainage basin of the snow-fed Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers. The northern boundary beyond the Riverina {{is determined by the}} Lachlan River catchment area and {{is referred to as the}} Central West. Along the Murray to the south, the Riverina borders the state of Victoria. West of the confluence of the Murray and Murrumbidgee is the beginning of the more arid Far West region.|$|E
5|$|During {{the latter}} half of the 1950s, the KWI met several times to discuss the need for a self-determined Indonesian Roman Catholic hierarchy. At these annual meetings, they touched on {{administrative}} <b>and</b> <b>pastoral</b> issues, including the translation of songs into Indonesian languages. In 1959 Cardinal Grégoire-Pierre Agagianian visited the country to see the Church's preparations. The KWI formally requested their own hierarchy in a May 1960 letter; this letter received a reply from Pope JohnXXIII dated 20March 1961, which divided the archipelago into six ecclesiastical provinces: two in Java, one in Sumatra, one in Flores, one in Sulawesi and Maluku, and one in Borneo. Semarang became the seat of the province of Semarang, and Soegijapranata its archbishop. He was elevated on 3January 1961.|$|E

5|$|Gebhard's defeat {{also changed}} the {{religious}} {{balance in the}} northwestern states. Although the Peace of Augsburg (1555) had addressed earlier the problem of religious pluralism, the solution potentially converted simple, and usually local, legal disputes into dynastic and religious warfare, as the Cologne War itself demonstrated. The result of the Cologne War gave the Counter Reformation {{a foothold in the}} lower Rhine. Ernst was a product of Jesuit education. Once his position was secured, he invited Jesuits into the territory to help re-establish Catholicism, a task which the Order approached zealously. They ejected Protestant pastors from parishes, sometimes by force, and re-established catechism education <b>and</b> <b>pastoral</b> visitations. Even when communities appeared to be reconverted, the Jesuits maintained strict supervision to identify recalcitrant Protestants or backsliders. The Jesuit reintroduction of Catholicism postponed the solution of Germany's religious problems for another half century.|$|E
5|$|Great Northern Highway links Western Australia's {{capital city}} Perth with its northernmost port, Wyndham. With {{a length of}} almost , it is the longest highway in Australia, with the {{majority}} included {{as part of the}} Perth Darwin National Highway. The highway is constructed as a sealed, predominantly two-lane single carriageway, but with some single-lane bridges in the Kimberley. Great Northern Highway travels through remote areas of the state, and is the only sealed road link between the Northern Territory and northern Western Australia. Economically, it provides vital access through the Wheatbelt and Mid West to the resource-rich regions of the Pilbara and Kimberley. In these areas, the key industries of mining, agriculture <b>and</b> <b>pastoral</b> stations, and tourism are all dependent on the highway.|$|E
5|$|Scotland's good arable <b>and</b> <b>pastoral</b> land {{is found}} {{mostly in the}} south and east of the country. Heavy rainfall, wind and salt spray, in {{combination}} with thin soil and overgrazing, made most of the western islands treeless. The terrain often made internal land communication difficult, encouraging a coastal network. In the Neolithic period, from around 6,000 years ago, there is evidence of permanent settlements and farming. The two main sources of food were grain and cow milk. From the Bronze Age, arable land spread at the expense of forest. From the Iron Age, there were hill forts in southern Scotland associated with cultivation ridges and terraces and the fertile plains were already densely exploited for agriculture. During the period of Roman occupation of Britain there was re-growth of trees indicating a reduction in agriculture.|$|E

5|$|The Normans {{arrived in}} Ceredigion in 1073–1074, {{and from the}} early twelfth century Norman {{political}} and ecclesiastical influence gradually increased, aided by the appointment, after 1115, of Norman bishops of St David's. In about the year 1106, Ithel and Madoc, who were in alliance with King Henry I, ravaged all the county of Cardigan, as Ceredigion was called by the Normans, {{with the exception of}} Llanbadarn Fawr and Llanddewi Brefi. Nevertheless, Llanbadarn Fawr suffered an attack upon its sanctuary, from which several of Owain ab Madoc’s men, who had taken refuge there, were dragged out by force and put to death. But by this time, scarcely a generation after Rhygyfarch was writing his Life of St David, the clas had declined in its spiritual <b>and</b> <b>pastoral</b> life, and its political importance, although its financial position remained strong, due to the substantial revenues of its extensive lands.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{distance}} between legislation and its enforcement. The governmental attacks on recusancy were mostly upon the gentry. Few recusants were actually fined; the fines that were imposed were often at reduced rates; the persecution eased; priests came to recognise {{that they should}} not refuse communion to occasional conformists. The persecutions did not extinguish the faith, but they tested it sorely. The huge number of Roman Catholics in East Anglia and the North in the 1560s disappeared into the general population in part because recusant priests largely served the great Roman Catholic houses, which alone could hide them. Without the Mass <b>and</b> <b>pastoral</b> care, yeomen, artisans and husbandmen fell into conformism. Roman Catholicism, supported by foreign or expatriate priests, came to be seen as treasonous.|$|E
5|$|England had {{a diverse}} {{geography}} {{in the medieval}} period, from the Fenlands of East Anglia or the heavily wooded Weald, through to the upland moors of Yorkshire. Despite this, medieval England broadly formed two zones, roughly divided by the rivers Exe and Tees: {{the south and east}} of England had lighter, richer soils, able to support both arable <b>and</b> <b>pastoral</b> agriculture, while the poorer soils and colder climate of the north and west produced a predominantly pastoral economy. Slightly more land was covered by trees than in the 20th century, and bears, beavers and wolves lived wild in England, bears being hunted to extinction by the 11th century and beavers by the 12th. Of the 10,000 miles of roads that had been built by the Romans, many remained in use and four were of particular strategic importance—the Icknield Way, the Fosse Way, Ermine Street and Watling Street—which criss-crossed the entire country. The road system was adequate for the needs of the period, although it was significantly cheaper to transport goods by water. The major river networks formed key transport routes, while many English towns formed navigable inland ports.|$|E
