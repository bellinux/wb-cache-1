5|$|Hurricane Gustav {{originated}} out of {{a tropical}} wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on August18. Shortly <b>after,</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> became embedded within the Intertropical Convergence Zone and tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean. By August23, the system began to intensify while convective activity become consolidated around the center of circulation. By 0600UTC on August24, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated that the wave spawned Tropical Depression Eight roughly 965miles (1,555km) east of Barbados. A weak ridge of high pressure {{to the north of}} the depression led to a general westward movement of the system. Gradually strengthening, the depression was upgraded to a tropical storm early on August25, at which time it was given the name Gustav.|$|E
5|$|Passenger service {{began on}} September 11, 1972, {{initially}} just between MacArthur and Fremont. The {{rest of the}} system opened in stages, with the entire system opening in 1974 when the transbay service though the Transbay Tube began. The new BART system was hailed as {{a major step forward}} in subway technology, although questions were asked concerning the safety of the system and the huge expenditures necessary for the construction of the network. Ridership remained well below projected levels throughout the 1970s, and direct service from Daly City to Richmond and Fremont was not phased in until several years <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> opened.|$|E
50|$|Later {{that day}} the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) {{initiated}} advisories on <b>the</b> <b>system</b> and designated it as Tropical Depression 24W <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>systems</b> low level circulation center had started to consolidate.|$|R

At present the doors may be opened automatically or manually. If a door tries to close and it meets an obstruction, the operator must re-open the door.|$|E
5|$|A new, {{extensive}} {{hurricane warning}} was issued late on August18 as forecasts showed Bob moving directly over southern New England. The warning covered areas between Cape Henlopen, Delaware to Plymouth, Massachusetts, including Long Island and Long Island Sound. Early on August19, all watches and warnings south of Cape Lookout, North Carolina were discontinued and the hurricane warning was extended northward to encompass areas south of Eastport, Maine. The Canadian Hurricane Centre began issuing warnings for Atlantic Canada later that day. Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick were placed under wind and heavy rain warnings. By {{the morning of}} August20, all watches and warnings in the United States were discontinued; however, a brief tropical storm warning was declared for coastal Maine between Rockland and Eastport before the remnants of Bob moved through eastern Canada. The advisories for Atlantic Canada were later discontinued <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> {{moved out of the}} region.|$|E
5|$|About {{nine hours}} <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> {{developed}} on August24, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued {{a tropical storm}} watch from the Seven Mile Bridge to Vero Beach. Later that day, the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch from Florida City to Vero Beach after the storm's intensification became apparent. About 25hours before Katrina made landfall, the tropical storm watch was extended northward to Titusville, and a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch was issued for Lake Okeechobee. Early on August25, a hurricane warning was issued from Florida City to Vero Beach and for Lake Okeechobee. In southeastern Florida, the lead time for the hurricane watch and warning occurred 31.5 and 19.5hours before landfall, respectively; both were 16.5hours less than the desired lead time. A tropical storm warning was also issued from Florida Key, southward through the Florida Keys to the Dry Tortugas, and northward along the western coast to Longboat Key. The warning in the Florida Keys occurred only nine hours {{before the onset of}} tropical storm force winds.|$|E

5|$|An area of {{convection}} persisted on January16 to {{the west}} of Diego Garcia, and that day Météo-France (MF) classified the system as Tropical Disturbance 08. The system maintained thunderstorms over a developing circulation, located in an area of weak to moderate wind shear. It developed outflow and gradually organized, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert on January17. That day, the MF discontinued advisories <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> briefly halted its development trend. The disturbance continued its movement {{to the west}}-southwest, and on January19 began intensifying. That day, the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 12S {{to the north of the}} northern coast of Madagascar. After continued development, MF upgraded the system to Tropical Storm Ernest on January20.|$|E
5|$|Due to the unanticipated {{relocation}} of Arlene, only one tropical cyclone watch or warninga tropical storm warning for coastal areas from Brownsville to Matagorda on June19was ever {{issued by the}} NHC {{in association with the}} cyclone. Issued 21hours before landfall, the warning was discontinued <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> moved inland. Prior to the warning, Arlene had satisfied the criterion for a tropical storm watch as a developing tropical depression. However, the NHC and various National Weather Service forecast offices opted to delay the watch {{as a result of the}} poorly organized appearance of the cyclone at the time. Given the weak nature of Arlene and the relatively unpopulated extent of coast which it impacted, evacuations were minimal – only fifteen fled from summer homes along Magnolia Beach and Indianola, Texas due to the threat of flooding.|$|E
5|$|During October 20, 2006 the Fiji Meteorological Service and the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center {{started to}} monitor a {{tropical}} depression, that had developed within the South Pacific Convergence Zone {{to the north}} of Temotu Province in the Solomon Islands. The system was located within an area of low to moderate vertical wind shear and had a good outflow in its northern and eastern quadrants. Over the next day conditions surrounding the system rapidly became favourable for further development, with convection starting to wrap into a well defined low level circulation centre. As a result, the depression rapidly developed further and was named Xavier by the FMS during October 22, after it had become a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> was named the JTWC initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 01P, while it was located over the Santa Cruz Islands. Throughout October 22, Xavier's rapid intensification continued with it developing an eye feature and becoming a category 3 severe tropical cyclone. During that day the system performed a small cyclonic loop over Temotu Province and passed near or over the Santa Cruz Island of Tikopia.|$|E

5|$|In all USB connectors, the {{construction}} always {{ensures that the}} external sheath on the plug makes contact with its counterpart in the receptacle before {{any of the four}} connectors within make electrical contact. The external metallic sheath is typically connected to system ground, thus dissipating damaging static charges. This enclosure design also provides a degree of protection from electromagnetic interference to the USB signal while it travels through the mated connector pair (the only location when the otherwise twisted data pair travels in parallel). In addition, because of the required sizes of the power and common connections, they are made <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> ground but before the data connections. This type of staged make-break timing allows for electrically safe hot-swapping.|$|E
5|$|On August1, in {{the middle}} of the {{southern}} hemisphere's winter, an area of convection persisted in the northeastern portion of the basin about 740km (460mi) northeast of Diego Garcia. At that time, an associated circulation was exposed to the east of the thunderstorms. At 06:00UTC that day, the MFR initiated advisories on Tropical Disturbance 1. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> organized further, the JTWC also began tracking the system as Tropical Cyclone 01S, estimating winds of 65km/h (40mph). With a ridge to the south, the system tracked generally westward, briefly becoming a tropical depression on August1. An approaching trough weakened the ridge, allowing the depression to turn southwestward. Located in an area of moderate wind shear, the system failed to intensify further, and it dissipated on August3.|$|E
5|$|On November9, {{an area of}} disorganized convection, or thunderstorms, persisted about 1175km (730mi) {{southeast}} of Palau. The system consisted of a broad circulation, affected to its detriment by moderate wind shear. Moving west-northwestward, the convection persisted and organized into the circulation, indicative of an increased potential for tropical cyclogenesis. Late on November10, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA), meaning the agency anticipated a tropical depression would develop within 24hours. Shortly thereafter, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Zoraida <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> entered its area of responsibility of the agency. At 1200UTC on November11, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated that a tropical depression formed about halfway between Palau and the Philippine island of Mindanao, although operationally the agency had classified the system two days prior.|$|E

5|$|Shortly <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> was {{declared}} a tropical storm, gale warnings were issued {{for the central}} Bahamas starting on October8. Slightly more than 24hours later, a hurricane watch was issued on Eleuthera and the Abaco Islands. By early on October11, both of the alerts were discontinued. Later that day, gale warnings were issued from Cape Lookout, North Carolina to Virginia Beach, Virginia. The warning area was extended to {{as far north as}} Nantucket, Massachusetts on October13. The warning for the area from Cape Lookout, North Carolina to Virginia Beach, Virginia was discontinued late on October14. Simultaneously, gale warnings were issued from Nantucket to Cape Cod, Massachusetts. In addition, another gale warning was also issued from Cape Cod to Boston, Massachusetts. By October15, all gale warnings were discontinued. Early in the hurricane's duration, NASA developed a contingency plan for delaying a landing of the space shuttle Challenger by a day in the event Josephine passed near Kennedy Space Center. The shuttle crew filmed the hurricane from orbit using an IMAX camera. This footage of the storm was featured in the 1985 IMAX documentary The Dream is Alive.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Blanca was a {{short-lived}} tropical cyclone during the 2009 Pacific hurricane season. Forming {{out of a}} trough of low pressure on July6, Blanca was immediately classified a tropical storm roughly 420mi (675km) south-southwest of {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California Peninsula. Later that day, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 50mph (85km/h) and a barometric pressure of 998mbar (hPa; 29.47inHg) as deep convection persisted around the center of circulation. Shortly <b>after,</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> began to weaken. Intermittent bursts of convection occurred on July7 before Blanca weakened to a tropical depression. The following day, the system degenerated into a remnant low pressure system, devoid of shower and thunderstorms. The remnants were monitored by the National Hurricane Center for another day. Although the storm did not impact land as a tropical cyclone, its remnants produced unseasonable rains in southern California and moisture from the system contributed to flooding in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Katrina {{originated}} out of {{the remnants}} of a cold front tracking southward through the Caribbean Sea on October22. By October26, a broad area of low pressure, associated with disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity, developed over the southwestern Caribbean Sea. The following day, a surface low pressure became apparent <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> showed signs of rotation near the northern Panama coastline. On October28, a hurricane hunter flight into the circulation revealed a well-defined low pressure system and resulting in the system being declared Tropical Depression Fifteen while situated roughly 175mi (280km) east of Bluefields, Nicaragua. The center of the newly classified depression was situated on the western edge of deep convection. The depression tracked slowly towards the northeast in response to the mid-level flow it was embedded within.|$|E

5|$|Wind shear {{began to}} {{increase}} earlier than forecast models anticipated, causing the storm to weaken into a minimal tropical storm later that morning. Around 1830UTC, {{the center of}} Erika passed over the island of Guadeloupe with winds of 40mph (65km/h) as the storm entered the eastern Caribbean Sea. The circulation later became elongated and began to degenerate into a trough of low pressure. The NHC noted that due to the large size of the overall system, the center of Erika could reform elsewhere and restrengthen. Following a brief increase in convective activity, the storm slightly intensified before succumbing to wind shear once more. By the afternoon of September3, the center of Erika was fully devoid of convection and the NHC downgraded it to a tropical depression. Shortly <b>after,</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> degenerated into a remnant low, coinciding with the issuance of the final advisory from the NHC. The following day, the remnants approached the southern coast of Puerto Rico, producing heavy rainfall across the island. The system was last noted later on September4 as it dissipated roughly 80mi (140km) south of Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|Within the Eastern Pacific basin - {{between the}} western coasts of the Americas and 140°W - {{fourteen}} {{names have been}} retired since naming started in the region in 1960.

The name Fico was subsequently retired <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> had affected Hawaii in 1978, while the name Knut was removed after being used in 1987 for unknown reasons having barely reaching tropical storm strength. In 1989 the name Iva was removed as it was pronounced very similarly to Hurricane Iwa, which was retired from the Central Pacific lists of names in 1982 after affecting Hawaii. In the early 1990s the names Fefa and Ismael were both retired after they affected Hawaii and Northern Mexico, respectively. Hurricane Pauline became the deadliest Eastern Pacific hurricane, and its name was retired after it affected Mexico in 1997.|$|E
5|$|A {{long-lived}} system {{developed on}} February28 in the Australian region south of February28, and moved westward. On March7, the JTWC initiated advisories {{on the system}} as Tropical Cyclone 26S, briefly estimating peak 1-minute winds of 65km/h (40mph) the next day. Soon <b>after,</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> weakened into a tropical depression, crossing into the south-west Indian Ocean late on March8. At that time, it was designated Tropical Disturbance E2. Continuing westward along {{the northern edge of}} a strong ridge, the disturbance failed to intensify due to easterly wind shear. Although the MFR ceased issuing advisories, they noted that a distinct circulation persisted, reaching a location to the north of Mauritius by March16. That day, it turned back to the east with a sporadic area of convection, influenced by the larger Tropical Depression E3. Two days later, the system organized enough for the MFR to reclassify it as a tropical disturbance. The system failed to reorganize much, and dissipated on March20. Another tropical disturbance, named E3, formed on March11 in the eastern portion of the basin. It initially failed to develop more, but after an increase in convection, the system intensified into a tropical depression on March14 while moving generally west-northwestward. On the next day, the system began drifting to the southwest due to weak steering currents. On March16, the JTWC initiated advisories on the system as Tropical Cyclone 28S, briefly upgrading it to tropical storm status on the next day. On March18, the depression began weakening, dissipating three days later.|$|E
