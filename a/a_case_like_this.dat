25|$|It {{may occur}} that systems of {{coordinates}} for two {{different sets of}} geometric figures are equivalent {{in terms of their}} analysis. An example of this is the systems of homogeneous coordinates for points and lines in the projective plane. The two systems in <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> are said to be dualistic. Dualistic systems have the property that results from one system can be carried over to the other since these results are only different interpretations of the same analytical result; this is known as the principle of duality.|$|E
25|$|VAM Gremlins {{used the}} updated body {{design of the}} U.S. and Canadian market AMC Spirit two-door sedan, as well as VAM {{versions}} of the Spirit Liftback, called the American GT and the Rally AMX. At the time, cars in Mexico took longer {{to be perceived as}} outdated than in the US and since the VAM Gremlin came to the public until 1974 instead of 1970, it was still relatively fresh among the Mexican buyers. Aside from this, the model kept a positive image throughout its whole run. In fact, it exceeded VAM's sales expectations in its first years. The company originally considered it a temporary low-volume model that would eventually be replaced by the upcoming Pacer model. In the end, the Gremlin stood and became VAM's all-time second best-selling line after the American. For these reasons VAM decided to keep the Gremlin name for the upcoming Spirit sedan model, being a testament of the very favorable image VAM cars in general held in Mexico. This was the third time <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> happened within the company with Rebel and Matador models kept the name Rambler Classic and the Hornet the Rambler American name.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - This {{paper has}} as its aim to analyse the {{evolution}} and current status of e-government, trying to deduce a series of basic principles for its success. Design/Methodology/Approach - <b>A</b> <b>case</b> study has served to achieve that aim, but prior to its presentation, a short review of the e-government literature along with some facts and figures {{have made it possible}} to assess the situation of e-government in various countries around the world, and more precisely in Spain. Findings - E-government lays emphasis on technology; however, the internal processes through which Public Administrations offer their services to citizens need careful reengineering. Originality/Value - Since, tax administration requires using a large amount of data, it is a key area in the application and study of e-government. That is why a Spanish public organisation in charge of tax administration has been examined in this paper. Research Limitations - Although <b>a</b> <b>case</b> study <b>like</b> <b>this</b> one, in which the analysis of e-government is restricted to the functioning of a tax administration body, may have limitations when it comes to generalising the conclusions drawn, the principles inferred from it can be easily extrapolated to the vast majority of Public Administrations...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIntroductionLymphedema is {{classified}} into two main types: secondary lymphedema accompanied by lymph node excision surgery or radiotherapy; and idiopathic lymphedema. Here we experienced <b>a</b> very rare <b>case</b> of lymphatic edema resulting from cardiac surgery {{that the patient}} underwent 50 years previously. Presentation of caseA 62 -year-old woman experienced progressive unilateral lower leg lymphedema for recent years. After undergoing cardiac surgery at another hospital {{at the age of}} 12 years, she gradually developed left lower leg edema. The cause of the edema was unclear and it remained untreated. Her edema symptoms gradually worsened in recent years, so she consulted the plastic surgery division of our hospital. DiscusssionPerhaps the lymphatic structures of affected individuals differ prior to disease onset. If the mechanism of lymphatic edema outbreak is elucidated, patients needing conservative and surgical therapy might be more easily identified. Knowing the outbreak mechanism of lymphatic edema would definitely ease the investigation of <b>an</b> unconventional <b>case</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> one. Conservative treatments for lymphedema, such as self-massage and compression therapy using garments, were immediately started. With these treatments, the leg volume and edema symptoms reduced. ConclusionThe research on the cause of this case may be important step for elucidating the source of secondary lymphatic edema...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{response}} of vote shares to economic fluctuations and conflict. Spain {{seems to be the}} ideal niche for <b>a</b> <b>case</b> study <b>like</b> <b>this</b> since it has experienced both phenomena during the last decades. Recent Spanish democratic history has witnessed four complete economic cycles, with deep recessions and pronounced booms. During this period, there has been a nationalistic conflict with terrorist manifestation. We use Spanish provincial data from the ten congressional elections since the end of Franco’s dictatorship. Vote shares at provincial level are modeled as fractional responses to unemployment, inflation, terrorism assassinations, turnout and other factors. The statistical model used, a fractional probit, specifies conditional means of district and election unobserved effects as linear functions of the covariates. Estimates of National Partial Effects (NPE), i. e. the effect on national vote shares of changes in unemployment, inflation and terrorism are statistically significant and quantitatively important. In addition, vote shares respond to participation rates and these also depend on economic factors and terrorism, thus creating an endogeneity problem. The expected margin of victory is then used as instrument for turnout. NPEs remain significant after proper accounting for endogeneity of turnout...|$|R
