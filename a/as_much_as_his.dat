5|$|Major {{developments}} in 19th-century Welsh literature include Lady Charlotte Guest's {{translation of the}} Mabinogion, {{one of the most}} important medieval Welsh prose tales of Celtic mythology, into English. 1885 saw the publication of Rhys Lewis by Daniel Owen, credited as the first novel written in the Welsh language. The 20th century experienced an important shift away from the stilted and long-winded Victorian Welsh prose, with Thomas Gwynn Jones leading the way with his 1902 work Ymadawiad Arthur. The slaughter in the trenches of the First World War had a profound effect on Welsh literature with a more pessimistic style of prose championed by T. H. Parry-Williams and R. Williams Parry. The industrialisation of south Wales saw a further shift with the likes of Rhydwen Williams who used the poetry and metre of a bygone rural Wales but in the context of an industrial landscape. Though the inter-war period is dominated by Saunders Lewis, for his political and reactionary views <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> plays, poetry and criticism.|$|E
5|$|McNichol {{was born}} in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire. His father, Danny, {{died when he was}} five, so McNichol and seven {{siblings}} were raised by their mother, Catherine. He attended St Joseph's School in Kilmarnock, and started work as a messenger boy for a local draper's shop when he left school. His shop work stopped him playing football on Saturdays, but he was able to play some midweek football for Junior club Hurlford United. When he was taken on at the local bus garage as an apprentice motor mechanic, he became available on Saturdays as well. Hurlford paid him ten shillings a game, nearly <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> apprentice's wages. During the Second World War, McNichol was called up to the Fleet Air Arm as a mechanic, but was able to play friendly matches for Inverness-based club Clachnacuddin. Because of the number of professional players stationed around the country, such matches were played at a fairly high standard.|$|E

25|$|During the {{overland}} journey, {{they stopped}} at Salt Lake City, where Ludlow found an industrious and sincere group of settlers. He brought to the city prejudice and misgiving about the Mormons, and a squeamishness about polygamy which embarrassed him almost <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> first view of a household of multiple wives. “I, a cosmopolitan, {{a man of the}} world, liberal to other people’s habits and opinions to a degree which had often subjected me to censure among strictarians in the Eastern States, blushed to my very temples,” he writes.|$|E
25|$|These interests, <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> {{aspirations}} to the titles and {{the lifestyle of}} the English landed gentry were influential {{in the formation of}} his personal art collection. This collection was mostly displayed in his London home and moved for safe-keeping to the north of England during the Second World War (1939–1945). On his death in 1940 the terms of his will placed his collection under the protection of a special trust established in his name and bequeathed it to the South African nation. Bailey was {{one of the very few}} South African Randlords to leave a bequest of this nature to South Africa.|$|E

25|$|Significantly, {{many of his}} {{earliest}} novels have Ireland as their setting—natural enough given his background, but unlikely to enjoy warm critical reception, given the contemporary English attitude towards Ireland. Critics {{have pointed out that}} Trollope's view of Ireland separates him from many of the other Victorian novelists. Some critics claim that Ireland did not influence Trollope <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> experience in England, and that the society in Ireland harmed him as a writer, especially since Ireland was experiencing the Great Famine during his time there. Such critics were dismissed as holding bigoted opinions against Ireland and failing to recognise Trollope's true attachment to the country.|$|E
25|$|The Gordons' {{charge at}} Dargai {{had caught the}} {{imagination}} of the British public, and the romantic description of the wounded piper encouraging his comrades on was perhaps the most famous element of it. Whilst recovering, Findlater received a large number of public donations, including sets of bagpipes, and by at least one account, a proposal of marriage. The public interest increased sharply after he was awarded the Victoria Cross, and to supplement his Army pension Findlater arranged to appear at the Military Tournament, where he drew large crowds; for just thirty performances, he was paid two-thirds <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> annual Army pension of £46. He then began to perform at music halls, first at the London Alhambra and then nationally, with his earnings climbing as high as £100 a week.|$|E
500|$|Boone {{spent his}} final years in Missouri, {{often in the}} company of {{children}} and grandchildren, where he continued to hunt and trap <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> health and energy levels permitted. According to one story, in 1810 or later, Boone went with a group on a long hunt as far west as the Yellowstone River, a remarkable journey at his age, if true. In 1816, a United States officer at Fort Osage, on the Missouri, wrote: ...|$|E

500|$|According to the American {{historian}} and Mormonism expert Richard Bushman, the [...] "signal feature" [...] of Smith's life was [...] "his {{sense of being}} guided by revelation". Instead of presenting ideas with logical arguments, Smith dictated authoritative revelations and let people decide whether to believe. [...] Smith's teachings came primarily through his revelations, which read like scripture: [...] and open to interpretation. Smith and his followers viewed his revelations as being above teachings or opinions, and Smith's actions seemed to indicate that he believed in his revelations <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> most loyal followers.|$|E
500|$|... is a 1967 Japanese yakuza film {{directed}} by Seijun Suzuki and starring Joe Shishido, Koji Nanbara and Annu Mari. It {{was a low}} budget, production line number for the Nikkatsu Company, originally released in a double bill with Shōgorō Nishimura's Burning Nature. The story follows Goro Hanada in {{his life as a}} contract killer. He {{falls in love with a}} woman named Misako, who recruits him for a seemingly impossible mission. When the mission fails, he becomes hunted by the phantom Number One Killer, whose methods threaten his sanity <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> life.|$|E
500|$|Norman {{started his}} working {{life as a}} butcher in Sussex before moving to London {{at the age of}} 14 where he sought a career on the music hall stage. There, he became {{interested}} in freak shows which he attended in his spare time. After viewing an exhibition called [...] "Electric Lady" [...] next door to his place of work, he went into business with the exhibition's manager and {{began his career as a}} showman of human oddities. He quickly became successful, for his patter <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> exhibits, and was called the 'Silver King' by the American showman P. T. Barnum.|$|E

500|$|... {{astonished}} me <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> intense industry. He painted {{directly on}} the white canvas, without rough sketch or any preparation of any sort, except for the firmly traced contours, and yet the solidity of the work was none the worse for it. I {{was struck by the}} keen attention with which he examined the model before touching brush to canvas. He seemed to proceed slowly, when in reality he executed very rapidly, placing one touch after the other in its place, rarely having to go over his work more than once. There was very little perceptible movement of his body or arms. His expression was perfectly calm...|$|E
500|$|Burges's {{furniture}} was, {{second to}} his buildings, his major {{contribution to the}} Victorian Gothic Revival; as Crook writes, [...] "More than anyone, it was Burges, with his eye for detail and his lust for colour, who created the furniture appropriate to High Victorian Gothic." [...] Enormous, elaborate and highly painted, Crook considers his [...] "art furniture medieval in a way no other designer ever approached." [...] The first detailed study of Burges's {{work in this area}} was by Charles Handley-Read in his article in The Burlington Magazine of November 1963, Notes on William Burges's Painted Furniture. Despised <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> buildings in the reaction against Victorian taste that occurred in the twentieth century, his furniture came back into fashion {{in the latter part of}} that century and now commands very high prices.|$|E
500|$|William {{served in}} the Royal Navy in his youth and was, both during his reign and afterwards, nicknamed the [...] "Sailor King". He served in North America and the Caribbean. In 1789, he was created Duke of Clarence and St Andrews. Since his two older {{brothers}} died without leaving legitimate issue, he inherited the throne when he was 64 years old. His reign saw several reforms: the poor law was updated, child labour restricted, slavery abolished in {{nearly all of the}} British Empire, and the British electoral system refashioned by the Reform Act 1832. Although William did not engage in politics <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> brother or his father, he was the last monarch to appoint a prime minister contrary to the will of Parliament. Through his brother Adolphus, the Viceroy of Hanover, he granted his German kingdom a short-lived liberal constitution.|$|E

500|$|Bruce {{also worked}} on his own {{property}} at Balcaskie, Fife, which he bought in 1665, and which does survive intact, although with later alterations. He doubled the L-plan house to a near-symmetrical U-plan, and may have built the curving wing-walls and linking pavilions. Gifford, however, attributes these to a later building phase. The curving walls, a form later seen at Hopetoun, were a new innovation if Bruce did carry them out, possibly inspired {{by the work of}} the Italian Gian Lorenzo Bernini. In the gardens he laid out parterres and stepped [...] "Italian" [...] terraces, with a vista leading the eye to the Bass Rock, all inspired by French baroque gardens such as Vaux-le-Vicomte. Internally, Bruce created a new layout of rooms, and it was for his continental-inspired internal planning, <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> exterior design, that he was sought after as an architect.|$|E
500|$|Ito's {{music is}} mainly {{inspired}} by {{images from the}} game rather than outside influences; however, he never played the games themselves. The only video games that he plays are sports games; he has only seen up to the introductory movie {{for most of the}} role-playing games that he has written music for. While many of his pieces are orchestral, he enjoys working in a recording studio and enjoys composing [...] "normal songs" [...] <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> orchestral works. His favorite video game music from other composers include the music from Star Fox, Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy, Wizardry and Nobunaga's Ambition. Non-video game music that has inspired him includes Japanese popular music and soundtracks to anime works, as well as easy listening music such as Paul Mauriat or Richard Clayderman, especially string music. These influences have led him to wish to create music [...] "that you can listen to while you relax". He also wishes to expand his compositions outside video game music and into ballads.|$|E
500|$|Johnston, {{known to}} his friends as Dave, was commemorated by both his fellow {{scientists}} and by the government. Known for his diligent and particular nature, he was called [...] "an exemplary scientist" [...] by a USGS dedication paper, which also described him as [...] "unaffectedly genuine, with an infectious curiosity and enthusiasm". He was quick to [...] "dissipate cynicism" [...] and believed that [...] "careful evaluation and interpretation" [...] was the best approach to his work. [...] An obituary notice for Johnston stated {{that at the time}} of his death he had been [...] "among the leading young volcanologists in the world" [...] and that his [...] "enthusiasm and warmth" [...] would be [...] "missed at least <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> scientific strength". Co-worker Andrew Alden states that Johnston had great potential, declaring that he [...] "had many friends and a bright future". Following the eruption, Harry Glicken and other geologists at the USGS dedicated their work to Johnston.|$|E
