Trans Polar was subject to a lawsuit by a laid-off pilot which the airline owed NOK26,600 in pay and compensation for him paying his own connection flights to reach Trans Polar charters. The company had issued several cheques and bills of exchange that had bounced and the pilot threatened to bankrupt the airline unless he was paid.

40|$|Abstract — An {{ontology}} is {{a formal}} language adequately rep-resenting the knowledge used for reasoning {{in a specific}} environ-ment. When contradictions arise and make ontologies inadequate, revision is currently <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> and <b>time</b> consuming task. We suggest the design of rational agents to assist scientists in ontology building through the removal of contradictions. These machines, in line with Angluin’s ”learning from different teachers ” paradigm, learn to manage applications in place of users. Rational agents have some interesting cognitive faculties: a kind of identity, consciousness of their behaviour, dialectical control of logical contradictions in a learned theory respecting a given ontology and aptitude to propose ontology revision. In the paper, we present an experimental scientific game Eleusis+Nobel as a framework outlining this new approach, i. e., automated assistance to scientific discovery. We show that rational agents are generic enough to support the ontology building process in many other contexts. I...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} years, Robot Learning from Demonstration (RLfD) {{has become a}} major topic in {{robotics}} research.
