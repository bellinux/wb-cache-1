This episode also features a guest appearance by Andy Kusnetzoff, who later joined the regular cast. Another episode has a flashback set in Italpark, an Argentine theme park which closed in 1990. Since the Italpark rides <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> Luján, the production moved there to shoot those scenes.|$|E
