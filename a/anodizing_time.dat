40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{formation}} mechanism of ribs {{on the outer}} wall of anodized TiO 2 nanotubes (NTs) prepared in a NaF/Glycerol electrolyte containing 2 wt% of water. The effect of potential and time on the morphology of the NTs is evaluated along with growth efficiency (% of total charge at the electrode used to form the oxide) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, providing an insight into the mechanism of formation of ribs. XPS analysis confirms the presence of fluorine, as TiF 6 2 -, and carbon as impurities in the anodic film. The growth efficiency of the process decreases from ∼ 70 % at 10 V to 55 - 58 % at 20 - 30 V and 14 % at 40 V. Similarly, the anodic growth factor (migration of ions expressed as the maximum radius of the "oxide cell" per applied potential, nm V - 1) decreases at higher potentials, due to oxygen bubbles evolving at the anode at 20 - 40 V and disrupting the anodizing process. The formation of gas bubbles also affects the morphology of the NTs; while NTs are smooth at 10 V, oxide rings appear over the range 20 - 40 V. Partial dissolution of the oxide rings due to fluorine ions eventually re-shapes the NTs forming ribs, whereas excessive dissolution over extended <b>anodizing</b> <b>times</b> tends to smoothen the NTs and eventually leads to collapse of the NTs. On {{the basis of these}} observations, we suggest oxygen evolution (requiring a minimum amount of water in the electrolyte and a sufficiently high potential 20 - 40 V) plays a primary role on the formation of ribs on anodized TiO 2 NTs.

30|$|The {{first part}} {{of this study is to}} prepare PAAO {{membranes}} through two-step anodization of high purity (99.997 %, Alfa Aesar, Karlsruhe, Germany). First of all, aluminum foils are cleaned in ethanol and acetone in sequence using ultrasonic vibration, and the foil surfaces are chemically cleaned in a mixture of HCl, HNO 3, and H 2 O with molar ratios of 10 : 20 : 70, respectively. To improve the pore order, the aluminum foils are first annealed in ambient nitrogen at 500 °C to increase the aluminum grain size and reduce their internal grain boundaries in order to achieve long-range homogeneity in the foils. Then, the aluminum foil surfaces are electrochemically polished using a mixture of H 3 PO 4, H 2 SO 4, and H 2 O with 4 : 4 : 2 weight ratios, respectively [18]. As reported in [7, 8], this process can decrease foil surface roughness down to submicron scales and remove the surface imperfections which are present on the aluminum foil after its rolling. The anodizing is carried out in a homemade anodizing cell cooled down to 2 °C using high purity phosphoric acid as the electrolyte (85 wt.%, Merck, KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). The foil temperature is kept constant at 1 °C. Various <b>anodizing</b> voltage and <b>time</b> are used.

Aluminum radio frequency windows are widely preferred because of their useful qualities such as their thermal stability, low out-gassing rate, mechanical strength, and dielectric properties. The problem with aluminum is its high multipactor susceptibility when high electric fields are applied in radio frequency applications. The application of thin film coatings of titanium nitride by varied means, have shown a reduction of multipactor. Coatings of oxygen on annealed aluminum foil radio frequency windows of less than nominal purity have yielded useful results as well. Although there are various other methods of reducing multipactor, thin film coatings are the most efficient and cost effective to implement. Analysis of titanium nitride pulsed laser deposited aluminum windows <b>anodized</b> for different <b>times</b> and annealed oxide adsorped thin films on an aluminum foil window for different times was done to examine their multipactor susceptibility and relative composition. The titanium nitride coated aluminum windows were shown to suppress multipactor quite well even after sputtering through layers of thin film. After successive sputtering and substantial digging, the thin film titanium nitride anodized aluminum windows revealed good structure, even distribution of material, and no penetration to the Al 2 O 3 layer. The oxide thin film layers on the aluminum foil showed promise after a substantial layer depth was reached. The study has demonstrated that the Duarte (CIMAV) process is sound when multipactor is concerned and Al 2 O 3 coatings on less than pure aluminum foil is as well quite effective at suppressing multipactor at room temperatures. ...|$|R
40|$|Titanium (Ti) is a {{material}} frequently used in orthopedic applications, {{due to its}} good mechanical properties and high corrosion resistance.

There are different techniques {{that can be used to}} modify the titanium surface; plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) is one of those alternatives, which consists of obtaining porous anodic coatings by controlling parameters such as voltage, current, <b>anodizing</b> solution and <b>time</b> of the reaction.

40|$|Due to its {{excellent}} biocompatibility {{and mechanical}} properties, Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy {{has been extensively}} used in the medical field, especially as a material for hard tissue replacement. Owing to the unique shape memory and superelastic properties, NiTi shape memory alloy (SMA, with 50. 8 at. % of Ni) has been investigated for load-bearing applications in orthopedics and dentistry. Since the longevity of current metal implants is approximately 10 to 15 years, many patients need to have revision surgeries in their lifetime. Therefore, there is great interest in the long-term stability, biocompatibility, bioactivity and other properties of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and NiTi SMA implants. Implant-associated infections also pose {{serious threat to the}} success of metal implants. The goal of this project was to investigate several low-temperature surface modification techniques, including anodization and electrochemical deposition, and formulate coatings for potential clinical applications. Accordingly, several types of coatings were synthesized on Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and NiTi SMA substrates. Various aspects of the coatings, such as morphology, chemical composition, crystallinity, phase and bioactivity, were analyzed. Firstly, a systematic study on the formation of titania nanotubes on Ti- 6 Al- 4 V by anodization was performed. <b>Anodizing</b> voltage and <b>time</b> were varied for comparisons. A dense and compact titania nanotube layer was synthesized on Ti- 6 Al- 4 V by anodizing at 25 V for 20 min. The titania nanotubes formed were rutile. After annealing at 500 oC for 1 h, the titania nanotubes became anatase. The anatase phase exhibited better wettability than the rutile phase. Secondly, dense and compact apatite coatings were formed on NiTi SMA samples through electrochemical deposition using mainly double-strength simulated body fluid (2 SBF) as the electrolyte. The deposition conditions were varied and apatite coating characteristics studied. With the inclusion of collagen molecules (0. 1 mg/ml) in the electrolyte (2 SBFC), apatite/collagen composite coatings were fabricated. Collagen fibrils were not only observed on the surface of composite coatings but also were embedded inside in the coatings and at the coating-substrate interface. Results obtained from transmission electron microscopic and X-ray diffraction analyses showed that the apatite crystals in apatite coatings and apatite/collagen composite coatings were calcium-deficient carbonated hydroxyapatite. Apatite/collagen composite coatings exhibited excellent hydrophilicity, whereas apatite coatings displayed hydrophobic surfaces. Finally, gentamicin-loaded, tobramycin-loaded, and vancomycin-loaded apatite coatings and apatite/collagen composite coatings were synthesized on NiTi SMA samples through electrochemical deposition using different drug concentrations in the electrolytes. A comparative study of apatite coatings and apatite/collagen composite coatings as drug delivery vehicles were conducted. Different aspects of antibiotic-loaded coatings (surface characteristics, chemical composition, wettability, etc.) and in vitro release behaviour were investigated. The antibiotics were physically embedded in coatings during coating formation. Upon sample soaking in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the release profiles established for antibiotic-loaded coatings demonstrated different levels of initial burst release and subsequent steady release characteristics. Apatite coatings and apatite/collagen coatings displayed preferential incorporation of specific antibiotics. For instance, apatite/collagen coatings showed better vancomycin incorporation than apatite coatings and the incorporation of vancomycin was better than tobramycin for apatite/collagen coatings. Apatite coatings demonstrated better tobramycin incorporation than apatite/collagen composite coatings. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

However, the maximum emission intensity of Figure 5 b is at 415 nm which is close to the beginning of the blue region. For the membrane which is anodized for 40 h (Figure 5 c), a high emission peak is observed at 394 nm which is quite close to the ultraviolet region.

The authors show {{the influence of the}} <b>anodizing</b> <b>time</b> on the oxide layer thickness, the pore diameter and the morphology. It is revealed that silicon dioxide nanoparticles are successful when incorporated into the open structure pores of the layer. The anodizing and the incorporation process were carried out wet on wet. Complementary electrochemical measurements show the potential of the modified oxide layer in view of corrosion protection despite their deliberated open porosity...|$|E
30|$|In summary, we have {{fabricated}} {{a complete}} titania nanoporous structure with uniform and parallel nanochannels using a two-step anodization process. The {{average pore diameter}} was approximately 70 nm and inter-pore distance was approximately 130 nm. Self-organized, highly ordered, and very smooth TNTs were fabricated in EG-based electrolyte by the first-step anodization. The top surfaces of TNTs were covered with an oxide layer irrespective of the <b>anodizing</b> <b>time.</b> Clean and homogeneous honeycomb-like patterned Ti substrates were left off after the detachment of TNTs from the underlying Ti-foil. The second-step anodization on the patterned Ti-substrate produced a uniform and closed packed TNTs with open end morphology. The second-step anodization in EG and aqueous HF-based electrolytes produced TNTs covered with a thin nanoporous layer on the top. Very rough and disordered morphology of TNTs were obtained in HF-based electrolyte unlike EG-based electrolyte via the second-step anodization. A highly oriented and complete TNP structure was obtained when the second-step anodization was conducted in glycerol-based electrolyte. TNP structure were attributed to the suppression of F-rich layer dissolution between the cell boundaries in the viscous electrolyte. In addition, we found that TNP structure retained in shape even {{in spite of a}} long <b>anodizing</b> <b>time</b> (72 h) after the second-step anodization and that its ordering was improved to a great extent. This study provides a simple route to fabricate highly oriented TNPs with parallel and uniform nanochannels, which may be useful for high performance applications such as sensors, filters, dye sensitized solar cells, and photocatalysis.|$|E
30|$|Thin {{films of}} porous anodic {{aluminum}} oxide (AAO) on tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) substrates were fabricated through evaporation of a 1, 000 - to 2, 000 -nm-thick Al, followed by anodization with different durations, electrolytes, and pore widening. A faster method to obtain AAO on ITO substrates has been developed, which with 2.5 vol.% phosphoric acid at a voltage of 195 V at 269 K. It {{was found that}} the height of AAO films increased initially and then decreased with the increase of the <b>anodizing</b> <b>time.</b> Especially, the barrier layers can be removed by extending the anodizing duration, which is very useful for obtaining perforation AAO and will broaden the application of AAO on ITO substrates.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} get a clear picture for {{describing}} the growth process of plasma electrolytic oxidation coatings under escalating voltage waveform, the characteristics of PEO coatings formed at different reaction stages were systemically investigated. The morphology and corrosion resistance of the films were studied by scanning electron microscope and potentiodynamic polarization curves. The uniform, semi-transparent and better corrosion resistance of the oxide films on the magnesium electrode surface were formed owe to the extended <b>anodizing</b> <b>time</b> at the initial stage under escalating voltage mode. After sparking occurred, generated ceramic coatings were brokedown, melted, cooled and solidified continuously, so the ceramic coatings were uniform and dense. It also exhibited superior corrosion resistance...|$|E
