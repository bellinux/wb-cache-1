2500|$|An <b>arpeggiator</b> (arp) is {{a feature}} {{available}} on several synthesizers that automatically steps through {{a sequence of}} notes based on an input chord, thus creating an arpeggio. [...] The notes can often be transmitted to a MIDI sequencer for recording and further editing. [...] An <b>arpeggiator</b> may have controls for speed, range, and order in which the notes play; upwards, downwards, or in a random order. [...] More advanced arpeggiators allow the user to step through a pre-programmed complex sequence of notes, or play several arpeggios at once. [...] Some allow a pattern sustained after releasing keys: in this way, a sequence of arpeggio patterns may be built up over time by pressing several keys one after the other. Arpeggiators are also commonly found in software sequencers. [...] Some arpeggiators/sequencers expand features into a full phrase sequencer, which allows the user to trigger complex, multi-track blocks of sequenced data from a keyboard or input device, typically synchronized with the tempo of the master clock.|$|E
2500|$|Many Muse {{songs are}} {{recognizable}} by Bellamy's use of vibrato, falsetto, and melismatic phrasing, influenced by Jeff Buckley. [...] As a guitarist, Bellamy often uses the <b>arpeggiator</b> and pitch-shift effects {{to create a}} more [...] "electronic" [...] sound, citing Jimi Hendrix and Tom Morello as influences. His guitar playing is also influenced by a more classical harmonic aesthetic, particularly the style of Latin and Spanish guitar music..|$|E
2500|$|Arpeggiators seem to {{have grown}} from the accompaniment system used in {{electronic}} organs in the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s. They were also commonly fitted to keyboard instruments through the late 1970s and early 1980s. [...] Notable examples are the RMI Harmonic Synthesizer (1974), Roland Jupiter-8, Oberheim OB-8, Roland SH-101, Sequential Circuits Six-Trak and Korg Polysix. [...] A famous example can be heard on Duran Duran's song [...] "Rio", in which the <b>arpeggiator</b> on a Roland Jupiter-4 plays a C minor chord in random mode. They fell out of favor by {{the latter part of}} the 1980s and early 1990s and were absent from the most popular synthesizers of the period but a resurgence of interest in analog synthesizers during the 1990s, and the use of rapid-fire arpeggios in several popular dance hits, brought with it a resurgence.|$|E

5000|$|Synthesizers, {{especially}} monophonic ones {{such as the}} TB-303, {{are often}} called upon to play arpeggios, especially in electronica. Some synths contain automatic <b>arpeggiators</b> especially for this purpose.|$|R
50|$|It was {{introduced}} in the early 1980s by Roland Corporation for the synchronization of music sequencers, drum machines, <b>arpeggiators</b> and similar devices. It has since been superseded by MIDI, in the mid to late 1980s. The DIN sync standard consists of two signals, clock (tempo) and run/stop. Both signals are TTL compatible, meaning the low state is 0 V and the high state is about +5 V.|$|R
2500|$|Many Muse {{songs are}} {{recognizable}} by lead vocalist Matt Bellamy's use of vibrato, falsetto, and melismatic phrasing, influenced by Jeff Buckley. As a pianist, Bellamy often uses arpeggios. Bellamy's compositions often suggest or quote late classical and romantic era composers such as Sergei Rachmaninov (in [...] "Space Dementia" [...] and [...] "Butterflies and Hurricanes"), Camille Saint-Saëns (in [...] "I Belong to You (Mon Coeur S'ouvre À Ta Voix)") and Frédéric Chopin (in [...] "United States of Eurasia"). As a guitarist, Bellamy often uses the <b>arpeggiator</b> and pitch-shift effects {{to create a}} more [...] "electronic" [...] sound, citing Jimi Hendrix and Tom Morello as influences. His guitar playing is also influenced by a more classical harmonic aesthetic, particularly the style of Latin and Spanish guitar music, as Bellamy cites: [...] "I learnt some Spanish guitar music that opened up a world of different harmonies and making music and a different sort of passion; very heavy music but it hasn't got a distortion pedal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Released as {{successor}} to Logic Pro 9 on July 16, 2013, Logic Pro X (10.0.0) included a new, single-window customizable interface, with a design {{in line with}} Final Cut Pro X, {{as well as new}} features. New tools in this release are Drummer, a virtual session player that automatically plays along with your song {{in a wide variety of}} drumming styles and techniques, and Flex Pitch, a Flex Time equivalent for pitch editing in audio recordings. [...] Also, a new [...] "Smart Controls" [...] feature allows users to map parameters from an array of plugins to a single, convenient control interface. Redesigned keyboards and synths were included, together with new stomp boxes, bass amp and drum kit designers, and a chord <b>arpeggiator.</b> A completely rebuilt sound and loop library was introduced, along with a new Patch architecture. Logic Pro X has also improved track organization by allowing users to group multiple tracks into 'folder' like categories (e.g., acoustics, synthesizers, vocals, percussion, etc.). In addition to this organization, Logic Pro X allows individuals to trigger 'solo,' 'mute,' and 'volume' controls for each group. Further improvements were made to score editing, exporting (now compatible with MusicXML format), and introduces MIDI plug-in compatibility. Coinciding with the release of Logic Pro X was the release of a companion iPad app called Logic Remote, which allows wireless control of Logic Pro X, including Touch Instruments for playing and recording software instruments as well as tools for navigating, making basic edits and mixing.|$|E
2500|$|... "Storms in Africa" [...] {{originated}} from an melody that Enya had {{played on the}} Juno-60 after Nicky had preset with a sound using its <b>arpeggiator</b> function {{and asked her to}} develop something with it. He returned to the studio several hours later to find Enya had come up with the song's chord sequence, which inspired him to suggest the title. From then on, he helped to [...] "guide its direction" [...] and arrangement. Two song was recorded with Gaelic and English lyrics; Roma recalled the Gaelic version became the favourite to which Enya and Nicky also agreed, which led to its addition on the album. The English version, titled [...] "Storms in Africa (Part II)", became a B-side on the former's single in 1989 and a bonus track on some later pressings of Watermark. In writing about [...] "Exile" [...] in 2002, Roma believed its theme of loneliness from the separation of one's love is also met with [...] "hope and determination" [...] that they will return. The song was originally recorded with wordless vocals, but Dickins thought it would work better with lyrics, in particular poetry by Wilfred Owen. Roma was familiar with some of Owen's works, and wrote a set of lyrics inspired by their style. Enya and Nicky wished to incorporate the shakuhachi, a Japanese flute, on the track but they could not find a player confident enough. Instead, as Nicky explained, they resorted to hiring [...] "a gypsy guy to play the flute". The vocal version was released as a B-side to Enya's single [...] "Book of Days" [...] in 1992, titled [...] "As Baile".|$|E
5000|$|It {{features}} 'infectious' chord progressions, <b>arpeggiators,</b> and vocals. Kat Bein of Billboard {{described the}} song as 'deceptively adorable', writing [...] "It's full of shiny, sparkling textures and rainbow-colored synths". EDMSauce {{described it as}} 'incorporation of aspects of both artists unique sounds'. They wrote [...] "It opens with a plucking melody punctured with drum beats. It is layered with synths, high-pitched vocals, and future bass drops".|$|R
50|$|DIN sync was {{introduced}} by Roland Corporation for the synchronization of music sequencers, drum machines, <b>arpeggiators</b> and similar devices, {{as part of the}} Digital Control Bus protocol. It {{was introduced}} in 1980 with the Roland TR-808, followed by other Roland equipment in 1981, including the CR-8000, TR-606, TB-303 and EP-6060. It was the basis for the MIDI interface, released in 1983, which eventually superseded it. DIN sync was also adopted by non-Roland instruments, such as Linn Electronics' LinnDrum.|$|R
50|$|A direct {{descendant}} of the Prophecy is the Korg Z1 (1998) which {{is the equivalent of}} a 12-note polyphonic Prophecy with enhanced models, more physical control, 61-note keyboard, bigger screen, 6-part multitimbrality, more presets and two powerful programmable twin <b>arpeggiators.</b> Among users (see user reviews of the Prophecy and Z1 in the music aficionado web site SonicState.com, and elsewhere) there is some contention as to whether the Z1 is the equal of twelve Prophecies or is lacking both sonically and cybernetically. The argument is subjective and might be considered specious.|$|R
5000|$|Improved Arpeggiator: The {{number of}} steps in the <b>arpeggiator</b> is {{increased}} to 32, while classic <b>arpeggiator</b> modes such as up, down, updown, downup and as played are added as well. Drag and drop of MIDI files onto the <b>arpeggiator</b> display is also possible now so that monophonic/polyphonic sequences can be imported into the <b>arpeggiator.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1985 synthesizers with {{built-in}} sequencing facilities were quite rare; however, the DW-8000 {{did have a}} 64-note <b>arpeggiator</b> section. An <b>arpeggiator</b> automatically plays the notes of chords in arpeggios (an arpeggio is playing the notes of a chord one after the other, instead of {{all at the same}} time) just from the user pressing a single note. The 64-note memory could be especially useful when the <b>arpeggiator</b> was set to its “assignable” mode. This allowed the <b>arpeggiator</b> to loop round any number of notes up to 64 that the user added to the arpeggio. The <b>arpeggiator</b> can be set to latch so that the sequence continues to play after the user releases the keys, or un-latched; then the sequence will immediately stop when keys are released. A facility to make the arpeggio span one or two octaves, or even the full keyboard can be selected. A tempo slider sits immediately {{to the left of the}} <b>arpeggiator</b> controls to control the speed of the <b>arpeggiator</b> sequence.|$|E
50|$|ARPEGGIATORThe onboard <b>arpeggiator</b> has six {{types of}} arpeggio. For a program whose voice mode is Dual/Split, arpeggios {{can be played}} on one or both timbres. Since <b>arpeggiator</b> {{settings}} {{can be made for}} each program, arpeggio types that are suitable for the sound of a particular timbre can be saved and played.|$|E
5000|$|The {{track is}} 3 minutes 45 seconds long {{and is the}} final song on the {{standard}} version of Madeon's album, Adventure. It features arcing <b>arpeggiators,</b> resonant piano chords, and bombastic kick drums, infused with Madeon's characteristic electro-pop synths. Madeon supplies his own vocals on its confessional verses and snare-supported chorus, which critics said to be distorted, distant and personal and reflects his deepest emotion. The Fader described the song as [...] "a pulsing surge of anthemic electro-pop, radiating M83's benevolent angst {{to a point where}} it could blow up ten soccer stadiums at once." ...|$|R
500|$|The writing, {{recording}} and mixing of That We Can Play {{is rooted in}} 1980s power pop. On a technical level, according to Steve Shaw of Fact magazine, Games's instrumentation includes everything expected in 1980's music and is executed correctly: bass lines, strings, keytar and <b>arpeggiators.</b> Instead of merely reproducing the sound from that era, the band pushes the music into unfamiliar territory. According to Pitchfork Medias Joe Colly, the EP has a nostalgic sound – due, in part, to the analog synths ("not just vintage but almost aged" [...] instrumentation) and their [...] "glitchy electro jams." ...|$|R
5000|$|The DR-110 had various outputs. It could output a [...] "V-trig" [...] {{clock pulse}} (+6V, 10ms duration), via a 3.5mm mini-jack, to allow other [...] "slave" [...] {{synthesizer}} units (e.g. <b>arpeggiators)</b> to synchronize to the DR-110 accent section. The DR-110 has a 10kΩ impedance unbalanced mono audio output, available on an ¼" [...] phone connector socket. This output can be plugged into a keyboard amplifier or PA system. The socket was configured as the [...] "Roland P-bus", which meant {{it also could}} be used as a simultaneous audio input, the input source being mixed with the output signal. A separate 3.5mm headphone output socket was also present. The headphone socket can be used with headphones to listen to the unit's drum sounds without disturbing others.|$|R

2500|$|... "River" [...] is an {{instrumental}} track, of which Nicky suggested its title {{as the music}} made him think of one when he heard it. He knew Enya had the final decision over song titles if she preferred another, but she liked his title and went with it. Nicky spoke about Enya's style of composing for song: [...] "There are five synths Midi'd but then she plays chords over these random <b>arpeggiators</b> with notes popping in and out where you don't expect them. Somehow she makes that work". [...] "The Longships" [...] makes reference to the longship war boats used by the Vikings, who first invaded Ireland in AD 795 and settled in Dublin by AD 841. [...] "Na Laetha Geal M'óige", translated from Gaelic as [...] "The Brighter Days of My Youth", is about the reminiscence of the days during Enya's childhood, and receives a dedication in Gaelic to her grandparents.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011, Gruenbaum, earned third {{prize in}} the third annual {{international}} Margaret Guthman Musical Instrument Competition for the Samchillian tip tip tip cheeepeeeee. The organizer of this competition stated that [...] "Some instruments - controllers - have this short or sometimes long learning curve, {{but once you get}} to a certain point, you know it, and that’s what it can do. And you cannot get better at it. I think the Samchillian is really an instrument with a learning curve that’s very long, and just like other acoustic instruments, violin, piano, there’s a wide range of technique. And this guy was really a virtuoso with this instrument. He was able to play chords, all kinds of <b>arpeggiators.</b> What I liked about it is it’s an instrument more than a controller. There’s always more to learn about how to become better with it. And I think that’s valuable." ...|$|R
50|$|RPG-8 Monophonic <b>Arpeggiator</b> - This {{contains}} a pattern section for muting selected notes in an arpeggio {{and a large}} display showing values and positions, and the 'Single Note Repeat' function engages the <b>arpeggiator</b> only when two or more simultaneous notes are held down. The 'Manual' mode will arpeggiate notes strictly in the order they were input for realtime arpeggio control.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>arpeggiator,</b> with {{a choice}} of up, down, up/down, or random mode. The <b>arpeggiator</b> can be {{prominently}} heard in Duran Duran's 1982 hit single [...] "Rio." [...] Switches on the far left select between the internal rate, adjustable, or an external source, such as the clock out of its contemporary, the Roland CR-78—a programmable analog drum machine. A hold button on the lower front panel allows users to latch or set a constantly running <b>arpeggiator</b> pattern, useful when playing leads on another machine over a JP-4 pattern. Otherwise the arpeggiation only responds when keys, individual or chords, are pressed. This allows for a more fluid and less rigid timing in live situations when playing with others.|$|E
50|$|In 1996 Kawai {{released}} the K5000, an additive synthesizer that greatly improved on the K5 {{and is now}} {{regarded as one of}} Kawai's very best instruments. It was manufactured in three versions: K5000S, which had 16 knobs for real-time control and an <b>arpeggiator,</b> K5000W which added a sequencer but lacked both the knobs and the <b>arpeggiator,</b> and the K5000R, a rack version with an <b>arpeggiator,</b> but no sequencer and no knobs. A Knobs Macro Box was sold separately for use with the W and R models. Kawai originally planned to release K5000X, which would combine the features of the S and W models with a 76-key keyboard and enhanced memory, but this was cancelled in the late '90s due to bad sales. Shortly thereafter the company stopped producing synthesizers.|$|E

5000|$|This {{electronic}} keyboard is a 61 key, 6-voice bitimbral polyphonic, analogue synthesizer. Its keys are unweighted and not velocity-sensitive. Its features include bitimbral splitting of the keyboard, Unison mode, a variable <b>arpeggiator</b> with a [...] "Hold" [...] function for latching the <b>arpeggiator,</b> multi-mode BBD chorus effect, and voice input for several of Akai's then-contemporary samplers {{such as the}} S612, S700, and X7000. It has 64 memory locations for sounds ("patches"). The instrument has limited MIDI implementation, and lacks the ability transmit or receive Sysex data.|$|E
