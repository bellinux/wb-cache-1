40|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>white</b> <b>balancing</b> works {{quite well}} on average, but seriously fails {{some of the}} time. These {{failures}} lead to completely unacceptable images. Can the number, or severity, of these failures be reduced, perhaps {{at the expense of}} slightly poorer <b>white</b> <b>balancing</b> on average, with the overall goal being to increase the overall acceptability of a collection of images? Since the main source of error in <b>automatic</b> <b>white</b> <b>balancing</b> arises from misidentifying the overall scene illuminant, a new illuminationestimation algorithm is presented that minimizes the high percentile error of its estimates. The algorithm combines illumination estimates from standard existing algorithms and chromaticity gamut characteristics of the image as features in a feature space. Illuminant chromaticities are quantized into chromaticity bins. Given a test image of a real scene, its feature vector is computed, and for each chromaticity bin, the probability of the illuminant chromaticity falling into a chromaticity bin given the feature vector is estimated. The probability estimation is based on Loftsgaarden-Quesenberry multivariate density function estimation over the feature vectors derived from a set of synthetic training images. Once the probability distribution estimate for a given chromaticity channel is known, the smallest interval that is likely to contain the right answer with a desired probability (i. e., the smallest chromaticity interval whose sum of probabilities is greater or equal to the desired probability) is chosen. The point {{in the middle of that}} interval is then reported as the chromaticity of the illuminant. Testing on a dataset of real images shows that the error at the 90 th and 98 th percentile ranges can be reduced by roughly half, with minimal impact on the mean error...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{efficient}} and robust illumination invariant background subtraction approach for pan/tilt cameras is introduced. In a preprocessing step a panorama-based approach for temporal pixel registration {{is used to}} obtain a joint motion independent background model. Hereby, inconsistencies in the background model occur due to alternating illumination, <b>automatic</b> <b>white</b> <b>balancing,</b> AGC, as well as lens vignetting artefacts. During background subtraction such inconsistencies and artefacts lead to segmentation clutter {{and as a consequence}} increase false detection rates. To overcome these problems, in this paper an illumination normalization method based on Difference-Of-Gaussian (DoG) band-pass filters is proposed. By preprocessing camera images by the proposed filters lens vignetting artefacts, as well as AGC and global illumination changes are eliminated robustly, and simultaneously local color and intensity information are preserved for accurate motion detection...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{illumination}} estimation for colour constancy and <b>automatic</b> <b>white</b> <b>balancing</b> of digital color imagery {{can be viewed}} as the separation of the image into illumination and reflectance components. We propose using nonnegative matrix factorization with sparseness constraints (NMFsc) to separate the components. Since illumination and reflectance are combined multiplicatively, {{the first step is to}} move to the logarithm domain so that the components are additive. The image data is then organized as a matrix to be factored into nonnegative components. Sparseness constraints imposed on the resulting factors help distinguish illumination from reflectance. Experiments on a large set of real images demonstrate accuracy that is competitive with other illumination-estimation algorithms. One advantage of the NMFsc approach is that, unlike statistics- or learning-based approaches, it requires no calibration or training...|$|R

40|$|The {{illuminant}} estimation has {{an important}} role in many domain applications such as digital still cameras and mobile phones, where the final image quality could be heavily affected by a poor compensation of the ambient illumination effects. In this paper we present an algorithm, not dependent on the acquiring device, for illuminant estimation and compensation directly in the color filter array (CFA) domain of digital still cameras. The proposed algorithm takes into account both chromaticity and intensity information of the image data, and performs the illuminant compensation by a diagonal transform. It works by combining a spatial segmentation process with empirical designed weighting functions aimed to select the scene objects containing more information for the light chromaticity estimation. This algorithm has been designed exploiting an experimental framework developed by the authors and it has been evaluated on a database of real scene images acquired in different, carefully controlled, illuminant conditions. The results show that a combined multi domain pixel analysis leads to an improvement of the performance when compared to single domain pixel analysis.

40|$|The {{performance}} of the MaxRGB illumination-estimation method for color constancy and <b>automatic</b> <b>white</b> <b>balancing</b> {{has been reported in}} the literature as being mediocre at best; however, MaxRGB has usually been tested on images of only 8 -bits per channel. The question arises as to whether the method itself is inadequate, or rather whether it has simply been tested on data of inadequate dynamic range. To address this question, a database of sets of exposure-bracketed images was created. The image sets include exposures ranging from very underexposed to slightly overexposed. The color of the scene illumination was determined by taking an extra image of the scene containing 4 Gretag Macbeth mini Colorcheckers placed at an angle to one another. MaxRGB was then run on the images of increasing exposure. The results clearly show that its performance drops dramatically when the 14 -bit exposure range of the Nikon D 700 camera is exceeded, thereby resulting in clipping of high values. For those images exposed such that no clipping occurs, the median error in MaxRGB’s estimate of the color of the scene illumination is found to be relatively small...|$|R

40|$|A sensor located {{inside a}} digital camera is only able to measure the light which is {{reflected}} by an object. The reflected light varies with the spectral power distribution of the illuminant. Hence, images taken with {{a digital camera}} may show a strong color cast if an incorrect white balance setting has been chosen. Such a color cast may also be due to an <b>automatic</b> <b>white</b> <b>balance</b> not working correctly. In contrast, colors perceived by a human observer appear to be approximately constant. Algorithms for <b>automatic</b> <b>white</b> <b>balance</b> try to mimic this ability and compute a color corrected image which {{appears to have been}} taken under an illuminant with a uniform power distribution. I show how color constancy algorithms can be implemented very efficiently on modern graphics processing units. A sensor inside a digital camera measures the light which is reflected from the objects of the scene. Some of the light is absorbed, the remainder is reflected and is able to enter the lens of the camera where it is measured. The reflected light varies with the type of illuminant used. Some light sources emit more light towards the red and green part of the spectrum and therefore appear to be very yellowish. If such an illuminant is used, then the scene will come out very yellowish i...|$|E
30|$|When {{white balance}} {{correction}} is performed on images acquired under different lighting conditions, if {{the image is}} always corrected with a uniform coefficient, {{it is impossible to}} obtain a better correction result under various conditions. Therefore, before correcting the image, it is necessary to first detect the color cast of the image to determine whether there is color cast. If it is a color cast image, its type needs to be determined. After knowing the specific color cast of the image, the image can be processed with different coefficients in a targeted manner. According to this idea, an <b>automatic</b> <b>white</b> <b>balance</b> algorithm based on image color cast detection is proposed.|$|E
