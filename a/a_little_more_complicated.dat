25|$|<b>A</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> {{problem is}} to find the number of non-attacking {{arrangements}} that do not change upon 90° rotation of the board. Let the board has 4n files and 4n ranks, and the number of rooks is also 4n. In this case, the rook that is on the first file can occupy any square on this file, except the corner squares (a rook cannot be on a corner square because after a 90° rotation there would 2 rooks that attack each other). There are another 3 rooks that correspond to that rook and they stand, respectively, on the last rank, the last file, and the first rank (they are obtained from the first rook by 90°, 180°, and 270° rotations). Removing the files and ranks of those rooks, one obtains the rook arrangements for a (4n−4)(4n−4) board with the required symmetry. Thus, the following recurrence relation is obtained: R4n = (4n−2)R4n−4, where Rn is the number of arrangements for a n'n board. Iterating, it follows that R4n = 2n(2n−1)(2n−3)...1. The number of arrangements for a (4n+1)(4n+1) board is the same as that for a 4n4n board; this is because on a (4n+1)(4n+1) board, one rook must necessarily stand in the centre and thus the central rank and file can be removed. Therefore R4n+1 = R4n. For the traditional chessboard (n = 2), R8 = 431 = 12 possible arrangements with rotational symmetry.|$|E

Using trivial or more advanced methods for the incremental exploration of possible indexing techniques, we are able to find alternative methods to the widely used metric space model paradigm. Through experimental evaluations, we validate our approach and show how it outperforms the known indexing methods. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Two {{explicit}} formulas for metric {{connections in}} the bundle of Dirac spinors are studied. Their equivalence is proved. The explicit formula relating the spinor curvature tensor with the Riemann curvature tensor is rederived. 1. Basic notations and definitions. Dirac spinors play crucial role in modern particle physics. However, this crucial application of Dirac spinors is based mostly on the special relativity, where the base manifold M is the flat Minkowski space. Passing to the general relativity, we get <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> theory of spinors. Let M be a space-time manifold of the general relativity. It is a four-dimensional orientable manifold equipped with a pseudo-Euclidean Minkowski-type metric g and with a polarization. The polarization of M is responsible for distinguishing the Future light cone from the Past light cone at each point p ∈ M (see [1] for more details). Let’s denote by DM the bundle of Dirac spinors over M (see [2] and [3] for detailed description). In addition to the metric tensor g inherited from M, the Dirac bundle DM is equipped with four other basic spin-tensorial fields...|$|R
40|$|A very {{prominent}} way {{to define the}} operational semantics of functional programs (which is especially qualified for beginners) {{is the use of}} computation sequences. The elements of a computation sequence are expressions which are one after another produced by substitutions and simplifications. Substitution corresponds to routine calls or, more precisely, to applications of a computational rule. Such a rule determines which calls have to be replaced by the body, where additionally in each case within the latter the formal paramters are substituted by the arguments. For instance, in the classical case of routines without patterns, the full-substitution rule says that all calls ahve to be replaced simultaneously, the leftmost-outermost rule says that from all calls which do not occur as arguments of other calls only the leftmost one has to be replaced, and the leftmost-innermost rule says that from all calls whcih are free from other calls only the leftmost one has to be replaced; see e. g., [4]. If patterns are allowed in routine declarations, then the computation rules are <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>more</b> <b>complicated.</b> Simplification executes operations of the pre-defined datatypes and evaluates conditionals...|$|R
2500|$|In addition, {{there is}} no surface tension in a {{supercritical}} fluid, as {{there is no}} liquid/gas phase boundary. By changing the pressure and temperature of the fluid, the properties can be [...] "tuned" [...] to be more liquid-like or more gas-like. One of the most important properties is the solubility of material in the fluid. Solubility in a supercritical fluid tends to increase with density of the fluid (at constant temperature). Since density increases with pressure, solubility tends to increase with pressure. The relationship with temperature is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>complicated.</b> At constant density, solubility will increase with temperature. However, close to the critical point, the density can drop sharply with a slight increase in temperature. Therefore, close to the critical temperature, solubility often drops with increasing temperature, then rises again.|$|E

At the moment the points open, there is a much smaller gap, say about , across the points. Something must be done to prevent the points from arcing as they separate; if the points arc, then they will drain the magnetic energy that was intended for the spark plug. The capacitor (condenser) performs that task. The capacitor temporarily keeps the primary current flowing so the voltage across the points is below the point's arcing voltage. There is a race: the voltage across the points is increasing as the primary current charges the capacitor, {{but at the same time}} the points' separation (and consequent arcing voltage) is increasing. Ultimately, the point separation will increase to something such as , the maximum separation of the points.|$|E

40|$|Knit on Demand is a {{research}} project at the Swedish School of Textiles in collaboration with Ivanhoe AB and SOMconcept AB. The purpose of the project is to test new production methods for knitwear that could strongly influence the fashion industry's need for agility. In autumn 2009 sales started in Stockholm. The project stands on three legs; design, knitting technology and logistics {{and the purpose of}} the paper is to describe the Knit on Demand project from these three perspectives. Designing the garments and the system was the most time consuming part of the project since the products had to be fashionable, manufacturable and preferably not to expensive so a few trade offs hade to be made. Look was however considered essential since fashion always comes first. For knitting a combination of fully fashion and cut and sew are used so that the garments keep some of the fully fashion advantages but remains easily customisable. Logistics becomes <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> because of the unique garments but the logistic costs does still not make up more than 3 - 5 percent of the sales price of a garment.

6000|$|... § XIII. The {{question}} of bevelling becomes <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> in the inlet than the outlook window, because the mass or {{quantity of light}} admitted is often of more consequence than its direction, and often vice versâ; and the outlook window {{is supposed to be}} approachable, which is far from being always the case with windows for light, so that the bevelling which in the outlook window is chiefly to open range of sight, is in the inlet a means not only of admitting the light in greater quantity, but of directing it to the spot on which it is to fall. But, in general, the bevelling of the one window will reverse that of the other; for, first, no natural light will strike on the inlet window from beneath, unless reflected light, which is (I believe) injurious to the health and the sight; and thus, while in the outlook window the outside bevel downwards is essential, in the inlet it would be useless: and the sill is to be flat, if the window be on a level with the spot it is to light; and sloped downwards within, if above it. Again, as the brightest rays of light are the steepest, the outside bevel upwards is as essential in the roof of the inlet as it was of small importance in that of the outlook window.|$|E

The corridor was empty, and with the key which Louis had given me I opened the door of Mr. Delora's bedroom without difficulty. The room was in darkness, but the electric-light knob was against the wall. I turned it on quickly. There was neither any one in the room, nor any evidence of it having been recently occupied t satisfied with my first inspection, I looked into the wardrobe and lifted the curtains of the bed. Very soon I was assured that there was no one in hiding. I sat down on the edge of the bed and began to consider how to pass the time for the next hour or so. The whiskey and soda set out upon the table attracted my attention. I went over to it, struck by a sudden thought! First I poured out a little of the whiskey. It smelt harmless enough. I tried it upon my tongue. There was no distinctive flavor. Then I looked at the soda-water syphon. The top was screwed up tightly enough, and it easily came undone with the application of a little force. I examined the screw. I felt certain at once, for some reason or other, that it had been tampered with recently. I poured a little of the soda-water into a glass. It was quite flat, and when I tasted it it had a peculiar flavor. Something seemed to have been added to it which destroyed altogether its buoyancy. I screwed on the top again and whistled softly to myself. The whiskey and soda had been placed there by Louis. He had even gone so far as to call my particular attention to it. The coffee which I had drunk a little before had also been prepared by Louis. He was evidently taking no chances! It was his intention that I should be asleep when the intruder, whoever he might be, should enter the room.
