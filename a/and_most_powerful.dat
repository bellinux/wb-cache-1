5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 19th century, the Empire of Brazil was the richest <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> nation in Latin America. It thrived under {{democratic}} institutions and a constitutional monarchy, and prided itself on the absence of the caudillos, dictators and coups d'état which were common across the rest of the continent. During the minority of emperor PedroII in the 1830s, however, there had been internal rebellions driven by local disputes for power within a few provinces. One of these, the Ragamuffin War, had been led by Gonçalves, as noted above.|$|E

The causeway network that linked Calakmul with the cities of El Mirador, Nakbe and El Tintal suggest strong political links between the four cities that may have begun in the Preclassic, when both Calakmul and El Mirador were important cities, and continued into the Classic period when Calakmul itself was the most powerful city in the region.

The title of duke was of relatively new origin in England; only one other ducal title existed previously.|$|E

To save weight on such large vessels, the ship's designer, Benedetto Brin adopted a radical {{solution}} for the time: he reserved armor only for the central portion of the ship where it protected the ships' engines and ammunition magazines, {{while the rest of the}} hull were extensively sub-divided with watertight compartments.|$|E

5|$|Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (c. 1275 – 23 June 1324) was a Franco-English nobleman. Though {{primarily}} {{active in}} England, {{he also had}} strong connections with the French royal house. One of the wealthiest <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> men of his age, he was a central player in the conflicts between Edward II of England and his nobility, particularly Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster. Pembroke {{was one of the}} Lords Ordainers appointed to restrict the power of Edward II and his favourite Piers Gaveston. His position changed with the great insult he suffered when Gaveston, as a prisoner in his custody whom he had sworn to protect, was removed and beheaded on the instigation of Lancaster. This led Pembroke into close and lifelong cooperation with the King. Later in life, however, political circumstances combined with financial difficulties would cause him problems, driving him away from the centre of power.|$|E

5|$|Between the hurricane's two landfalls, Dean {{affected}} {{an estimated}} 207,800people {{in the states}} of Quintana Roo, Campeche, Veracruz, Hildalgo, Puebla and Tabasco. The storm damaged 85miles (140km) of power lines and left more than 100,000people without electricity. Landslides, storm tides, and widespread structural damage combined to compromise water sources throughout the country. The extent of the damage was never calculated at a federal level, but hundreds of villages lost access to fresh water {{in the days following}} the storm. Hurricane Dean killed 12people in Mexico but none of the deaths occurred during its first <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula. Between the two landfalls the storm caused a total of Mex$2billion (US$184million) of damages.|$|E

As the highest ranking cerebrate, Daggoth was a tactical genius {{in command of the}} Tiamat Brood, the largest <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> brood in the Zerg Swarm. Voiced by Micky Neilson, Daggoth is the most strong-willed and ferocious of the cerebrates. It trains the player character in the Zerg campaign of StarCraft and dispenses forces to protect Kerrigan following her transformation. Daggoth was charged with protecting the Overmind itself. In the wake of the Overmind's death, Daggoth immediately takes command of the fractured Zerg broods, annihilated several renegade zerg broods, and ordered several cerebrates to merge to form a new Overmind.|$|E
5|$|From the Glades peoples, {{two major}} nations {{emerged in the}} area: the Calusa and the Tequesta. The Calusa was the largest <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> nation in South Florida. It {{controlled}} fifty villages located on Florida's west coast, around Lake Okeechobee, and on the Florida Keys. Most Calusa villages were located at the mouths of rivers or on key islands. The Calusa were hunter-gatherers who lived on small game, fish, turtles, alligators, shellfish, and various plants. Most of their tools were made of bone or teeth, although sharpened reeds were also effective for hunting or war. Calusa weapons consisted of bows and arrows, atlatls, and spears. Canoes were used for transportation, and South Florida tribes often canoed through the Everglades, but rarely lived in them. Canoe trips to Cuba were also common.|$|E

5|$|Galileo had alienated one of {{his biggest}} <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>powerful</b> supporters, the Pope, and was called to Rome to defend his {{writings}} in September 1632. He finally arrived in February 1633 and was brought before inquisitor Vincenzo Maculani to be charged. Throughout his trial, Galileo steadfastly maintained that since 1616 he had faithfully kept his promise not to hold any of the condemned opinions, and initially he denied even defending them. However, he was eventually persuaded to admit that, contrary to his true intention, a reader of his Dialogue could well have obtained the impression that it was intended to be a defence of Copernicanism. In view of Galileo's rather implausible denial that he had ever held Copernican ideas after 1616 or ever intended to defend them in the Dialogue, his final interrogation, in July 1633, concluded with his being threatened with torture if he did not tell the truth, but he maintained his denial despite the threat.|$|E
