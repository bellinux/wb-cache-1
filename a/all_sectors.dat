Participants in the NZ ETS must surrender one emission unit (either an international 'Kyoto' unit or a New Zealand-issued unit) for every two tonnes {{of carbon dioxide}} equivalent emissions reported or they may choose to buy NZ units from the government at a fixed price of NZ$25.The one-for-two transional measure will be phased out evenly across relevant sectors over three years from 1 January 2017.
