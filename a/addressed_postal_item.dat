The aim is to develop the project "Electronic Registry", which can be implemented into current information systems of the company and which will contribute to the optimization of processes of the registry. To achieve this objective it was developed an extensive analysis of the current state of registry and records management system in E. ON Czech Republic. Based on analysis it was proposed a specific solution for improvement. The first part {{deals with the}} analysis of current legislative requirements and theoretical analysis of the document lifecycle, which is demonstrated on the example of E.
