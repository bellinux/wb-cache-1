5000|$|Seeing {{the mouth}} {{plays a role}} in the very young infant's early {{sensitivity}} to speech, and prepares them to become speakers at 1 - 2 years. In order to imitate, a baby must learn to shape their lips in accordance with the sounds they hear; seeing the speaker may help them to do this. Newborns imitate <b>adult</b> <b>mouth</b> movements such as sticking out the tongue or opening the mouth, which could be a precursor to further imitation and later language learning.

40|$|SummaryDevelopmental {{plasticity}} {{has been}} suggested to facilitate phenotypic diversity, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this relationship are little understood. We analyzed a feeding dimorphism in Pristionchus nematodes whereby one of two alternative <b>adult</b> <b>mouth</b> forms is executed after an irreversible developmental decision. By integrating developmental genetics with functional tests in phenotypically divergent populations and species, we identified a regulator of plasticity, eud- 1, that acts in a developmental switch. eud- 1 mutations eliminate one mouth form, whereas overexpression of eud- 1 fixes it. EUD- 1 is a sulfatase that acts dosage dependently, is necessary and sufficient to control the sexual dimorphism of feeding forms, and has a conserved function in Pristionchus evolution. It is epistatic to known signaling cascades and results from lineage-specific gene duplications. EUD- 1 thus executes a developmental switch for morphological plasticity in the adult stage, showing that regulatory pathways can evolve by terminal addition of new genes...|$|E

40|$|Even though {{echinoderms}} {{are members}} of the Bilateria, the location of their anterior/posterior axis has remained enigmatic. Here we propose a novel solution to the problem employing three lines of evidence: the expression of a posterior class Hox gene in the coeloms of the nascent adult body plan within the larva; the anatomy of certain early fossil echinoderms; and finally the relation between endoskeletal plate morphology and the associated coelomic tissues. All three lines of evidence converge on the same answer, namely that the location of the <b>adult</b> <b>mouth</b> is anterior, and the anterior/posterior axis runs from the mouth through the adult coelomic compartments. This axis then orients the animal such that there is but a single plane of symmetry dividing the animal into left and right halves. We tentatively hypothesize that this plane of symmetry is positioned along the dorsal/ventral axis. These axis identifications lead {{to the conclusion that the}} five ambulacra are not primary body axes, but instead are outgrowths from the central anterior/posterior axis. These identifications also shed insight into several other evolutionary mysteries of various echinoderm clades such as the independent evolution of bilateral symmetry in irregular echinoids, but do not elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the adult coelomic architecture...|$|E

40|$|Obstructive sleep apnoea {{syndrome}} (OSAS) is a frequently occurring {{disease with}} multiple co-morbidities. Left untreated, OSAS has important health and socioeconomic consequences but effective therapies are available. Consequently, its diagnosis is important. The usual pathway for a reliable diagnosis includes detailed sleep history, clinical examination followed by attended full polysomnography (PSG) which is the reference standard for the diagnosis of respiratory sleep disorders. This approach is a time and resource consuming process given its increasing demand. Therefore, several less elaborate sleep portable monitoring (PM) devices {{have been developed for}} the diagnosis of OSAS. Up to now however, no single device has been widely accepted as an alternative to PSG because of important limitations such as the lack of sleep/wake status assessment, the lack of detection of arousals during sleep (an important contribution in the calculation of the respiratory arousal index, an index of disease severity, and a criteria used for respiratory events - hypopnoea- scoring). This thesis focuses on the added value of mandible movement (MM) assessment in a new type of PM system, the Somnolter®, for the detection and diagnosis of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) in <b>adults.</b> <b>Mouth</b> opening is a common observation during sleep in patients suffering from sleep-disordered breathing and is different from mandible posture during sleep in healthy adults. We demonstrated that this approach allows for a better accuracy in the detection of SDB in an automated analysis, both in men and women. The first finding was a better detection of hypopnoea when compared to a PM without MM analysis, thanks to the associated salient mandible movement (SMM). SMM {{has been used as a}} surrogate for respiratory arousal. We also found that this method improved the accuracy of the apnoea hypopnoea index calculation (AHI), the most important index in SDB severity assessment. The calculation of this AHI depends on the total sleep time (TST) which is the denominator. Thus, the second important finding of this work was the sleep/wake state assessment which provided the TST. Thirdly, we were able to demonstrate that mandible behaviour under CPAP treatment was similar to the one found in healthy subjects. Typically, this translates into a mouth in a more closed position without repeated downward excursions. Indeed, mandible downward excursions and breathing effort are highly correlated. The fourth finding was that the MM analysis might be an interesting non-invasive marker of breathing effort during sleep and is less sleep disruptive than the invasive conventional method (oesophageal pressure). A fifth finding was the feasibility of successfully training scorers for the visual recognition of these patterns. Specific mandible patterns have been isolated, described and correctly identified in active wakefulness, in quiet sleep, in quiet wakefulness, during obstructive and central apnoea and hypopnoea, during mixed apnoea, during snoring and respiratory related arousals. The addition of MM assessment to a PM device allows for the identification of sleep/wake state, sleep micro-fragmentation and the detection of excessive breathing effort in obstructive respiratory events. For these reasons, we conclude that the Somnolter® is potentially an interesting alternative to PSG in the management of SDB in adults. (MED - Sciences médicales) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R

40|$|A {{prevailing}} theory {{regarding the}} evolution of language implicates a gestural stage prior {{to the emergence of}} speech. In support of a transition of human language from a gestural to a vocal system, articulation of the hands and the tongue are underpinned by overlapping left hemisphere dominant neural regions. Behavioral studies demonstrate that human <b>adults</b> perform sympathetic <b>mouth</b> actions in imitative synchrony with manual actions. Additionally, right-handedness for precision manual actions in children has been correlated with the typical development of language, while a lack of hand bias has been associated with psychopathology. It therefore stands to reason that sympathetic mouth actions during fine precision motor action of the hands may be lateralized. We employed a fine-grained behavioral coding paradigm to provide the first investigation of tongue protrusions in typically developing 4 -year old children. Tongue protrusions were investigated across a range of cognitive tasks that required varying degrees of manual action: precision motor action, gross motor action and no motor actions. The rate of tongue protrusions was influenced by the motor requirements of the task and tongue protrusions were significantly right-biased for only precision manual motor action (p <. 001). From an evolutionary perspective, tongue protrusions can drive new investigations regarding how an early human communication system transitioned from hand to mouth. From a developmental perspective, the present study may serve to reveal patterns of tongue protrusions during the motor development of typically developing children...|$|R

It is silver-grey in colour with large pointed ears and a dark colouring around the <b>mouth.</b> <b>Adults</b> measure 350 mm at the shoulder and have a weight of 2. 5 to 3 kg. They are remarkably agile, espe-cially since the bushy tail serves as a counter-balance when dodging and weaving. Ecology: The Cape fox is endemic to the Cape region and surrounding areas. These animals are active hunters and prey on insects, mice and other small animals. They occasionally feed on wild fruit. Excess food is cached in holes and covered with ground. Most of their activity is at night. Social structure: The Cape fox appears to be monogamous. They are solitary animals (except females with cubs) and live in dens...|$|R
40|$|Background: Parental care, while {{increasing}} parental fitness through offspring survival also bears {{cost to the}} care-giving parent. Consequentially, trade offs between parental care and other vitally important traits, such as the immune system seem evident. In co-occurring phases of parental care and immunological challenges negative consequences through a resource allocation trade off on both the parental and the offspring conditions can be predicted. While the immune system is reflecting parental stress conditions, parental immunological investments also boost offspring survival via the transfer of immunological substances (trans-generational immune priming). We investigated this relationship <b>adult</b> and juvenile <b>mouth</b> brooding East African cichlid Astotatilapia burtoni. Prior to mating, females were exposed to an immunological activation, while others remained immunologically naive. Correspondingly, immunological status of females was either examined directly after reproduction or after mouth brooding had ceased. Offspring from both groups were exposed to immunological challenges to assess the extent of trans-generational immune priming. As proxy for immune status, cellular immunological activity and gene expression were determined. Results: Both reproducing and mouthbrooding females allocate their resources towards reproduction. While upon reproduction the innate immune system was impeded, mouthbrooding females showed an attenuation of inflammatory components and an elevated stress levels. Juveniles from immune challenged mouthbrooding females showed downregulation of immune and life history candidate genes, implying a limitation of trans-generational plasticity when parents experience stress during the costly reproductive phase. Conclusion: Our results provide evidence that parental investment via mouthbrooding is beneficial for the offspring. However, both parental investment {{and the rise of}} the immunological activity upon an immune challenge are costly traits. If applied simultaneously, not only mothers seem to be impacted in their performance, but also offspring are impeded in their ability to react upon a potentially virulent pathogen exposure...|$|R
