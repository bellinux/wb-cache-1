6000|$|I objected {{the dangers}} of ocean, and the {{distance}} of the mountains we saw, from Athens; a distance which, from the savage uncultivation of the country, was almost impassable. Adrian, who was delighted with Clara's proposal, obviated these objections. The season was favourable; the north-west that blew would take us transversely across the gulph; and then we might find, in some abandoned port, a light Greek caique, adapted for such navigation, and run down the coast of the Morea, and, passing over the Isthmus of Corinth, without much land-travelling or fatigue, find ourselves at Athens. This appeared to me wild talk; but the sea, glowing with a thousand purple hues, looked so brilliant and safe; my beloved companions were so earnest, so determined, that, when <b>Adrian</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Well, though it is not exactly what you wish, yet consent, to please me"--I could no longer refuse. That evening we selected a vessel, whose size just seemed fitted for our enterprize; we bent the sails and put the rigging in order, and reposing that night in one of the city's thousand palaces, agreed to embark at sunrise the following morning.|$|E

We saw the deed done, though we have both held our peace concerning it. Paul de Vaux, I am inclined to spare you a great blow which it is {{in my power to}} strike. I am inclined to spare you, but I make one hard and fast condition. Adrea is not for you! She must be neither your wife, nor your friend, nor your ward! There must be no dealings, no knowledge between you the one of the other! There is blood between you; it can never be wiped out! The stain is forever. Lift up your hand to heaven, and swear that you will never willingly look upon her face again, or, as God is my master, I will bring upon your name, and your family, and you, swift and everlasting shame!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Prior to {{his role}} on Primetime Glick, Adrian had been admiring Jiminy from afar for many years, {{but had been}} laid up with a skin condition, thus putting him out of work. He then began to send Jiminy fan letters and finally asked him for a job saying, [...] "I think you need a harp." [...] However, it was a typo and Jiminy thought <b>Adrian</b> <b>said</b> tarp. Jiminy was doing some work on his pool at the time, so he called Adrian back. While waiting for Jiminy's response, Adrian boarded the cruise ship S.S.S.

Chase initially tortures Oliver by holding his head under water for 145 seconds at a time.

Chase then tries unleashing the killer in Oliver by putting Evelyn Sharp (Madison McLauglin) in the cage with him. Oliver tries to appeal to Evelyn but fails and when Chase returns, he snaps Evelyn's neck. During Chase's torture, Oliver finally admits that he killed {{because he wanted to}} and liked it.

Monique and Shawne are happy to see the end of the race and to know who they think is going to win. Dana said that Joe and Heidi were hoping that Louie and Michael are not in the Final Three because of their dislike for them after being U-Turned. Louie and Michael called into the hotel, and the eliminated teams were shocked and disappointed to hear about Louie and Michael being eliminated. Joe asked Louie and Michael if they still felt that they had used the U-Turn correctly. Michael told him that they had because he thought Joe and Heidi would be very tough to beat once the Race route reached Asia. <b>Adrian</b> <b>said</b> that Joe and Heidi's wishes came true, but despite Louie and Michael being eliminated, Joe was still not satisfied.

5000|$|Speculation arose, however, {{concerning}} the intellectuality of this move, as many had questioned Beltre's offensive capabilities, {{and those of}} the Red Sox themselves, stating that the loss of Jason Bay would hurt the club, who have won at least 95 games in all but one of Terry Francona's seasons as manager. In response to this, Theo Epstein stated, [...] "I think Adrian's reputation is that he's one of best defenders in the game, period, let alone one of the best defensive third baseman. He's got all the attributes you look for in a third baseman. He's got quickness, he's got great hands. His feet are tremendous. Great arm and very quick release. He has that signature play coming in on balls, which he does better than maybe anyone {{in the history of the}} game. He attacks the baseball. He's really a weapon defensively, and we're looking forward to having him help our run prevention. But as <b>Adrian</b> <b>said,</b> he's not just just a defender. He has the ability to be a very well-rounded player and, in fact, a leader on the team. We look forward to having him help our club win in all phases of the game this year." ...|$|E
