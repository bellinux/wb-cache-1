The MMI approach is a low-cost, rapid field method that produces an aquatic condition index that responds precisely to <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>pressures,</b> making it useful for conservation and environmental management. We developed four candidate MMIs based on benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages sampled at 40 randomly selected sites to assess the environmental condition of streams upstream of a hydroelectric power plant in the Brazilian Neotropical Savanna biome. Those MMIs were built from landscape-adjusted and unadjusted biological metrics as well as two alternative ways of choosing metrics. The alternative MMIs performances were tested by comparing their precision to distinguish least-disturbed areas, responsiveness to discriminate least-and most-disturbed areas, and sensitivity to <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>pressures</b> at catchment and local scales. The best performing MMI had landscape-adjusted metrics and was produced through use of principal component analysis for metric selection.

This index discriminated well the <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>pressures</b> at local-and catchment-scales, and at both scales simultaneously, as indicated by an integrated disturbance index.

Here, we provide a state-of-the-art review of the use of SIA for assessing <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>pressures</b> on natural ecosystems, in order to establish current knowledge gaps and identify promising applications for evaluating the ecological status of marine coastal waters. Specifically, the potential of SIA to provide food web-scale indicators for estimating cumulative <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>pressures</b> is addressed. The review indicates that the methodology has been used for virtually the whole spectrum of human pressures known to influence marine ecosystems. However, only the effects of chemical pollution, release of dissolved and particulate nutrients, and invasive species have been extensively investigated. For the first two pressures, substantial efforts have been made to implement isotopic quantitative approaches and metrics for inter-system comparisons; however, with the exception of nutrient release, the majority of aquatic studies have been carried out in freshwater systems, and only limited information is available on marine environments. In particular, the effects of invasive species on coastal habitats have received scant attention.

50|$|The {{increased}} {{population of}} human inhabitants {{and the expansion}} of grasslands (due to human activity) has caused a fragmentation of the species into many sub-populations. Many factors (mostly related to human activity) contributed to the fragmentation of the population, including the expansion of farmland, human occupation, lack of accessible habitat and the sparsity of suitable or favorable habitat. Due to this isolation, gene flow has begun to slow and sub-populations are suffering from a lack of gene diversity which could mean a long term issue. A study conducted by researchers found that gene flow accompanied the divergence of western lowland and Cross River gorillas until just 400 or so years ago, which rather supports a scenario in which intensifying human activities may have increased the isolation of these ape populations. The recent decrease in the Cross River population is accordingly most likely attributable to increasing <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>pressure</b> over the last several hundred years.|$|E
