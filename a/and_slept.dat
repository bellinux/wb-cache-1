5|$|When Bellingham {{received}} {{news of his}} forthcoming trial {{he asked}} Harmer to arrange {{for him to be}} represented in court by Brougham and Peter Alley, the latter an Irish lawyer with a reputation for flamboyance. Confident of his acquittal, Bellingham refused to discuss the case further with Harmer, and spent the afternoon and evening making notes. After drinking a glass of porter, he went to bed <b>and</b> <b>slept</b> soundly.|$|E
5|$|At first Catherine {{kept the}} nine-year-old king, who cried at his coronation, close to her, <b>and</b> <b>slept</b> in his chamber. She presided over his council, decided policy, and {{controlled}} state business and patronage. However, {{she was never}} {{in a position to}} control the country as a whole, which was on the brink of civil war. In many parts of France the rule of nobles held sway rather than that of the crown. The challenges Catherine faced were complex and in some ways difficult for her to comprehend as a foreigner.|$|E

5|$|By 1969, Clarence13X {{became very}} tired <b>and</b> <b>slept</b> little. He feared {{that he would}} be killed and {{instructed}} his followers to remain strong if he died. On June12, he spent time with several of his disciples at their school. He left the school between 2:00 and 3:00 am on June 13 and then gambled for an hour or two. As was his occasional practice, he traveled to Dora Smith's house to rest. He was ambushed by three assailants who fatally shot him {{while he was in the}} lobby of her apartment building. That morning, several people from the mayor's office met with his family, and the mayor later visited the Five Percenters' school to express condolences.|$|E
5|$|Stratton went on {{to become}} a first-generation {{experimental}}ist in psychology. Wundt's lab in Leipzig, with experimental programs bringing together the fields of evolutionary biology, sensory physiology and nervous-system studies, was a part of the career of most of the first generation. It was the exposure there, added to the graduate work at Yale, that influenced Stratton into becoming a psychologist. It was there that he started his binocular vision experiments as well. In these experiments, he found himself adapting to the new perception of the environment over a few days, after inverting the images his eyes saw on a regular basis. For this, he wore a set of glasses inverting images both upside-down and left-right. Stratton wore these glasses over his right eye and covered the left with a patch during the day, <b>and</b> <b>slept</b> blindfolded at night. Initial movement was clumsy, but adjusting to the new environment took only a few days.|$|E
5|$|Troop sleepers, {{generally}} {{intended for}} use by enlisted personnel, were equipped with bunks stacked 3-high, <b>and</b> <b>slept</b> 29 servicemen plus the Pullman porter. Every passenger was provided with a separate Pullman bed, complete with sheets and pillowcases that were changed daily. The berths were {{laid out in a}} cross-wise arrangement that placed the aisle along one side of the car, as opposed to down the center. Though the upper berths were fixed, the middle and lower sections could be reconfigured into seating during the daytime. Weapon racks were provided for each group of berths. Four washstands (two mounted {{at each end of the}} car) delivered hot and cold running water. The cars also came outfitted with two enclosed toilets and a drinking water cooler.|$|E

60|$|That gentle {{fluttering}} {{was a sweet}} lullaby, <b>and</b> Bobby <b>slept</b> <b>and</b> dreamed--he {{dreamed that}} the fluttering became louder and louder, and that, instead of birds, it {{was a group of}} angels that shook their wings and stood around him as he slept.|$|R
5|$|When Allen {{and his men}} landed above St. John and scouted the situation, {{they learned}} that a column of 200 or more regulars was approaching. Rather than attempt an ambush on those troops, which {{significantly}} outnumbered his tired company, Allen withdrew {{to the other side}} of the river, where the men collapsed with exhaustion <b>and</b> <b>slept</b> without sentries through the night. They were awakened when British sentries discovered them and began firing grapeshot at them from across the river. The Boys, in a panic, piled into their bateaux and rowed with all speed upriver. When the expedition returned to Ticonderoga two days later, some of the men were greatly disappointed that they had nothing to show for the effort and risks they took. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga and Crown Point proved to be crucial in the Revolutionary War because it secured protection from the British to the North and provided vital cannon for the colonial army; some even speculate that if the attempts to capture the two forts had been unsuccessful, the colonists might not have won the war.|$|E
5|$|When she debuted, Jill was an 18-year-old {{manicurist}} {{working to}} support her struggling family. The character is known for her feud with Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper); it is the longest feud {{in the history of}} American soap operas. Their rivalry began when she fell in love <b>and</b> <b>slept</b> with Katherine's husband Phillip Chancellor II (Donnelly Rhodes) and became pregnant. Following Phillip's accidental death, the women fought over custody of Jill's son, Phillip Chancellor III (Thom Bierdz), as well as numerous of Katherine's other husbands. A 2003 plot twist shockingly revealed Jill to be Katherine's long lost biological daughter, although in 2009, former head writer Maria Arena Bell rewrote their history, reversing that decision. In 2010, Jill discovered she is the daughter of Neil Fenmore (Jim Storm).|$|E

25|$|Barbara Griffiths {{was found}} in the woods later that {{afternoon}} roughly a mile from her home.

25|$|Meanwhile, none of Gardner's {{co-workers}} {{knew that}} he and his son were homeless in the Tenderloin District of San Francisco for nearly a year. Gardner often scrambled to place his child in daycare, stood in soup kitchens <b>and</b> <b>slept</b> wherever he and his son could find safetyâ€”in his office after hours, at flophouses, motels, parks, airports, on public transport, and even in a locked bathroom at a BART station.|$|E

25|$|With {{the death}} of Rebbe Yissachar Dov in 1926, the mantle of {{leadership}} fell on his eldest son, Rabbi Aharon Rokeach, who was 49 {{years old at the}} time. A deeply spiritual, almost mystical man, who studied much <b>and</b> <b>slept</b> and ate little, Rebbe Aharon was known for his saintliness and his miracle-working capabilities. Many of his followers reported experiencing miraculous recoveries or successes after receiving his blessing, and flocked to his court by the thousands.|$|E
25|$|Close {{fellowship}} {{with his}} men: He treated {{all of his}} men like equals. He ate the same food as they did <b>and</b> <b>slept</b> {{out in the open}} as they did. Even when a temporary shelter was erected for him, he made sure several soldiers could find room to sleep inside before he found a spot of his own. When there was not enough wine to go around, he would dilute it with water so every soldier would receive a portion.|$|E
25|$|The Gypsy Horse was bred by the Roma of Great Britain to {{pull the}} vardoes in which they lived and {{travelled}}. The Roma {{had arrived in the}} British Isles by 1500 AD, but they did not begin to live in vardoes until around 1850. Prior to that, they travelled in tilted carts or afoot <b>and</b> <b>slept</b> either under or in these carts or in small tents. The peak usage of the Gypsy caravan occurred {{in the latter part of}} the 19th century and the first two decades of the 20th.|$|E

25|$|On Tuesday, July 12, Speck {{returned}} to the NMU hiring hall and in mid-afternoon received an assignment on Sinclair Oil's tanker SS Sinclair Great Lakes, a thirty-minute drive away in East Chicago, Indiana, but when he arrived there he found his spot had already been taken and was driven back to the by then closed NMU hiring hall. Speck {{did not have enough}} money for a rooming house, so he dropped off his bags six blocks east at the Manor Shell filling station at 9954 S. Torrence Ave. <b>and</b> <b>slept</b> in an unfinished house just off E. 103rd St.|$|E
