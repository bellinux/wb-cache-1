With KOR assistance and support from many intellectuals, workers occupying factories, mines and shipyards across Poland joined forces. Within days, over 200 factories and enterprises had joined the strike committee. By August 21, most of Poland was affected by the strikes, from coastal shipyards to the mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area (in Upper Silesia, the city of Jastrzębie-Zdrój became center of the strikes, with a separate committee organized there, see Jastrzębie-Zdrój 1980 strikes).

This post apocalyptic movie {{is set in}} 2006 {{in the context of}} a 9.5-magnitude earthquake which kills millions of people, with Preston leading a motley military patrol on the island to help survivors in the pole shift-affected world. The film was partly shot in Eilat, Israel. Later in 2000, Dolph appeared in Damian Lee's Agent Red (also known as Captured), alongside Alexander Kuznetsov, Natalie Radford and Randolph Mantooth. The film is set during the Cold War, and is about two soldiers trapped on a submarine with a group of terrorists who plan to use a chemical weapon against the United States. Lundgren's character, Matt Hendricks, must work with his wife, a virologist, to prevent the scenario occurring. After the film was completed, producer Andrew Stevens thought it was too poor to be released and multiple people had to be hired to at least make the film half-competent. The film was very poorly received, given its [...] "shoestring budget"; the DVD and Film Guide of 2005 wrote, [...] "low-budget mess stars Dolph Lundgren as a navy special operations commander trying to keep a deadly virus out of the hands of terrorists.

The Council 2 ̆ 7 s founders were men who embodied the values and habits of mind {{of the first half}} of the decade ofthe 1880 s. They therefore created a peak labour body which could accommodate the features of a rapidly disappearing industrial relations system, a system based on exclusivist craft unions, on the benevolence of the city 2 ̆ 7 s employers, on the assumption of the unity of purpose of capital and labour, on an unchanging social and industrial environment.

2500|$|Promoter Joseph E. Levine was {{the crucial}} U.S. figure in {{exploiting}} the opportunities offered by foreign genre production. In 1956, low-budget producer Richard Kay acquired a Japanese creature feature, Godzilla, for $30,000. Levine financed {{the shooting of}} new footage with American actor Raymond Burr that was edited into the film—the total cost to the U.S. partnership was less than $100,000. The Americanized version, Godzilla, King of the Monsters!, was distributed on the East Coast by Levine's Embassy Pictures. Levine himself {{came up with a}} string of taglines: [...] "Fantastic beyond comprehension, beyond compare—Astounding beyond belief!", [...] "Terror staggers the mind as the gargantuan creature of the sea surges up on <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> destruction to wreak vengeance on the Earth!", and many more. Godzilla, King of the Monsters! was a B-market hit, grossing over $2million in its original run. In 1959, Embassy acquired the worldwide rights to a cheaply made movie starring an American-born bodybuilder as one of the original superheroes. Steve Reeves had appeared in all of two films previously; his debut was in the independent production Jail Bait (1954), directed by Ed Wood On top of a $125,000 purchase price for his import, Levine then spent $1.5million on advertising and publicity, a virtually unprecedented amount. The New York Times was nonplussed: [...] "Hercules, an Italianmade spectacle film dubbed in English, is the kind of picture that normally would draw little more than yawns in the film market. It would have, that is, had it not been that promoter Joseph E. Levine has launched the movie throughout the country with a deafening barrage of publicity. The exploitation film, which has been taken over by Warner Brothers for distribution, opened yesterday at 135 theatres in the New York area alone." [...] Levine counted on opening-weekend box office for his profits, booking the film [...] "into as many cinemas as he could for a week's run, then withdrawing it before poor word-of-mouth withdrew it for him." [...] The strategy was a smashing success: the film earned $4.7million in domestic rentals alone. Just as valuable to the bottom line, it was even more successful overseas.

40|$|We derive {{and employ}} a {{depth-averaged}} {{model for the}} formation of free bars in infinitely long tidal channels in order to investigate the mechanism whereby tidal bars may experience a net migration over <b>a</b> <b>tidal</b> cycle. The flux of the suspended sediment is modeled by means of an analytical relationship derived by Bolla Pittaluga and Seminara [M. Bolla Pittaluga and G. Seminara, Water Resour. Res. 39, 5 (2003) ] for slowly varying flows. The model is validated by performing a linear stability analysis of flow and bed topography in a rectangular channel with an erodible bed, subject to the propagation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> symmetric <b>tidal</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> small amplitude. The results of the present depth averaged model show a fairly satisfactory agreement with previous results based on a three-dimensional model [G. Seminara and M. Tubino, J. Fluid Mech. 440, 49 (2001) ]. We then investigate the role of overtides, showing that a flood or ebb asymmetry of the basic flow gives rise to a net migration of bars. The mechanism is due to the nonlinearity of the dependence of sediment flux on bottom stress. This phenomenon is somewhat similar to processes occurring in various fields of fluid mechanics, such as steady streaming in an oscillatory boundary layer [N. Riley, Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech. 33, 43 (2001) ] or acoustic streaming. The present investigation also bears some relevance to the problem of nonlinear development of tidal bars, as it suggests that a depth averaged approach may be adequate to its treatment, while definitely requiring a computational effort much smaller than treatments based on 3 D formulations...|$|R

As a result, some EA professionals are finding that their scope of work is getting smaller. A creative opportunity for EAPs to increase their revenues—one that has been rejected by many in the past— involves partnering with the credit counseling industry. The scope of this opportunity is reflected in the fact that an estimated 55 million workers in the United States are not saving sufficiently for retirement and at least 15 percent of employees are experiencing stressful financial problems (Garman, Leech, and Grable, 1996). If EAPs gained only 1 percent of financially troubled employees as clients, it would amount to more than 1 million people.
