5|$|<b>AIDS</b> <b>was</b> first {{clinically}} {{observed in}} 1981 in the United States. The initial cases were {{a cluster of}} injection drug users and gay men with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), a rare opportunistic infection that was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems. Soon thereafter, additional gay men developed a previously rare skin cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Many more cases of PCP and KS emerged, alerting U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a CDC task force was formed to monitor the outbreak. The earliest retrospectively described case of AIDS {{is believed to have}} been in Norway beginning in 1966.|$|E
5|$|And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic is a 1987 book by San Francisco Chronicle {{journalist}} Randy Shilts. The book {{chronicles the}} discovery and {{spread of the}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) with a special emphasis on government indifference and political infighting—specifically in the United States—to what was then perceived as a specifically gay disease. Shilts' premise is that <b>AIDS</b> <b>was</b> allowed to happen: while the disease {{is caused by a}} biological agent, incompetence and apathy toward those initially affected allowed its spread to become much worse.|$|E
5|$|Before Ryan White, <b>AIDS</b> <b>was</b> {{a disease}} stigmatized as an illness {{impacting}} the gay community, {{because it was}} first diagnosed among gay men. That perception shifted as Ryan and other prominent HIV-infected people such as Magic Johnson, Arthur Ashe and the Ray brothers appeared in the media to advocate for more AIDS research and public education to address the epidemic. The U.S. Congress passed a major piece of AIDS legislation, the Ryan White CARE Act, shortly after White's death. The Act has been reauthorized twice; Ryan White Programs are the largest provider of services for people living with HIV/AIDS in the United States.|$|E
50|$|One {{challenge}} {{for assessing the}} effectiveness of <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> that not all <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> intended to generate economic growth.

5|$|In 2016 about 36.7 {{million people}} were living with HIV and it {{resulted}} in 1 million deaths. There were 300,000 fewer new HIV cases in 2016 than in 2015. Most of those infected live in sub-Saharan Africa. Between its discovery and 2014 AIDS has caused an estimated 39million deaths worldwide. HIV/AIDS is considered a pandemic—a disease outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading. HIV {{is believed to have}} originated in west-central Africa during the late 19th or early 20th century. <b>AIDS</b> <b>was</b> first recognized by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1981 and its cause—HIV infection—was identified {{in the early part of}} the decade.|$|E
5|$|Ryan White was an American {{teenager}} from Kokomo, Indiana {{who became}} a national poster child for HIV/AIDS in the United States after being expelled from school because of his infection. A hemophiliac, he became infected with HIV from a contaminated blood treatment and, when diagnosed in 1984, was given six months to live. Though doctors said he posed no risk to other students, <b>AIDS</b> <b>was</b> poorly understood at the time, and when White tried to return to school, many parents and teachers in Kokomo rallied against his attendance. A lengthy legal battle with the school system ensued, and {{media coverage of the}} struggle made White into a national celebrity and spokesman for AIDS research and public education.|$|E
5|$|Ryan Wayne White (December 6, 1971– April 8, 1990) was an American {{teenager}} from Kokomo, Indiana, {{who became}} a national poster child for HIV/AIDS in the United States after failing to be re-admitted to school following an AIDS diagnosis. As a hemophiliac, he became infected with HIV from a contaminated blood treatment (Factor VIII) and, when diagnosed in December 1984, was given six months to live. Doctors said he posed no risk to other students, but <b>AIDS</b> <b>was</b> poorly understood {{by the general public}} at the time. When Ryan tried to return to school, many parents and teachers in Howard County rallied against his attendance due to concerns of the disease spreading through bodily fluid transfer. A lengthy administrative appeal process ensued, and news of the conflict turned Ryan into a popular celebrity and advocate for AIDS research and public education. Surprising his doctors, Ryan White lived five years longer than predicted but died in April 1990, one month before his high school graduation.|$|E
50|$|The first hearing <b>aid</b> <b>was</b> {{created in}} the 17th century.

25|$|<b>AIDS</b> <b>was</b> first {{reported}} June 5, 1981, when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded {{a cluster of}} Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (now still classified as PCP but known {{to be caused by}} Pneumocystis jirovecii) in five homosexual men in Los Angeles. The discovery of the virus took several years of research, and was announced in 1984 by Dr. Gallo of the National Cancer Institute, Dr. Luc Montagnier at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and Dr. Jay Levy at the University of California, San Francisco.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the fungibility {{of foreign aid}} and makes three contributions to the existing literature. Firstly, fungibility of aid at the aggregate level is reexamined on a richer panel dataset of 91 developing countries for 1980 - 2009, taking into account endogeneity of aid and autocorrelation in residuals. Results indicate that <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> strongly fungible: around 80 % is substituting rather than increasing government spending in the short run. There is also substantial heterogeneity in the sample, with aid being more fungible for countries with a low share of aid in GDP. Secondly, <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> disaggregated into bilateral and multilateral components. Despite substantial differences between both components, there are only very small indications that multilateral <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> less fungible than bilateral <b>aid</b> and estimates <b>are</b> volatile when <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> instrumented. Thirdly, this study attempts to distinguish between off- and on-budget aid at the aggregate level using the value of technical cooperation {{as a proxy for}} off-budget aid. While on-budget <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> strongly fungible, off-budget <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> non-fungible. In the long run, around 50 % of aid increases government expenditures, although results are not stable. High levels of fungibility (except for off-budget aid) suggest that resources spent on earmarking may be wasted and donors should rethink the way <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> distributed...|$|R

30|$|Altruistic <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> the {{one that}} seeks to enhance {{economic}} development. According to Lumsdaine (1993 : 38), this kind of <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> the sort of assistance offered with the pure objective of {{improving the quality of}} life. Altruistic <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> usually offered on soft-terms and in long-term basis. Morgenthau (1962 : 304) refers to it as ‘aid for economic development’ and Hook (1995) labels it under ‘aid welfare’. The difference between humanitarian and altruistic <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> that the former is provided in emergency situations and its interventions are punctual, while the latter seeks sustained development with long-term interventions.|$|R

25|$|The Hong Kong AIDS Foundation (Traditional Chinese: 香港愛滋病基金會) is a {{non-governmental}} {{charitable organisation}} established {{by a group}} of volunteers in 1991. Its current chairman is Dr. Leong Che Hung, GBS, JP (Traditional Chinese: 梁智鴻). When the Foundation was founded, public understanding towards <b>AIDS</b> <b>was</b> limited and misconceptions about AIDS (e.g., that AIDS is a contagious disease) were common, leading to widespread discrimination against patients infected with AIDS. Recently, the Foundation has a full-time staff of 13 but relies heavily on over 300 volunteers to maintain services such as telephone hotlines, blood testing and counselling, and support programmes for people living with AIDS.|$|E

40|$|<b>Aid</b> <b>is</b> {{said to be}} fungible at the {{aggregate}} level if it raises government expenditures by less than the total amount. This happens when the recipient government decreases domestic revenue, decreases net borrowing, or when aid bypasses the budget. This study makes three contributions to both fungibility and fiscal response literature. First, fungibility at {{the aggregate}} level is re-examined on a bigger recent panel dataset, distinguishing between short- and longterm impact of aid. The results indicate that <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> partly fungible {{in the long run}} and highly fungible in the short run. Second, to account for aid bypassing the budget, technical cooperation is used as a proxy for off-budget <b>aid.</b> Off-budget <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> found to be non-fungible and on-budget <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> partly fungible. Third, fungibility of bilateral and multilateral <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> analysed: the results indicate lower fungibility of multilateral aid...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at {{assessing}} the effects of aid on fiscal behaviour in Indonesia. There are four main findings. First, the inflow of <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> driven primarily {{by the need to}} fill the fiscal gap; that <b>is,</b> <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> demand driven. Second, although project <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> by definition intended for development expenditures, it results in an increase in routine expenditure as well. This suggests that project <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> fungible: it creates extra resources available to increase non-discretionary spending. Third, programme aid tends to increase routine expenditure but not development expenditure; thus, it mainly serves as budgetary support. Fourth, aid flows make the Government of Indonesia fiscally “lazy”. The availability of <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> a disincentive to mobilize domestic revenue through a more efficient and effective taxation system.

25|$|A {{relationship}} between Colin and Barry was quickly developed and {{the residents of}} Albert Square gossiped in hushed voices about {{the true nature of}} their friendship. In 1987 EastEnders was responsible for screening the first ever gay kiss in a UK soap opera, much to the outrage of the viewing public. A small kiss on the forehead, given to Barry from Colin, received a record number of complaints from angry viewers. In addition, the right-wing British press reacted with fury. They began a smear campaign, branding the programme 'filth' and, for a while, dubbed the show EastBenders. There were even questions in parliament about whether it was appropriate to have gay men in a family show when <b>AIDS</b> <b>was</b> sweeping the country.|$|E
25|$|Colin had {{a health}} scare during {{the autumn of}} 1988 {{and for a moment}} it looked like EastEnders might have been about to do an AIDS storyline. The press speculated that Colin was showing early signs of the disease and the {{possibility}} was even briefly indicated to on-screen when Colin himself began to fear that his symptoms were AIDS related. In fact giving Colin <b>AIDS</b> <b>was</b> never the programme's intention — it was felt that the most simplistic and unhelpful message that the programme could give out would be to have its only homosexual character become HIV positive — particularly as it happened at a time when misconceptions and fear about AIDS were rife. Colin was eventually diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, although this fact was kept from him by his doctor {{for the remainder of the}} year and he lived out 1988 with the belief that he was in perfect health.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies in}} the {{development}} aid literature have concluded that bilateral <b>aid</b> flows have <b>been</b> dominated by strategic objectives of major donors. Similar analysis of multilateral aid flows has determined that these allocations are more sensitive to economic need and quality of institutions and policy of the recipient country. A consensus has emerged that all bilateral <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> strategically driven while multilateral <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> independent of these political pressures. This paper challenges these conventional notions of the different aid types by analyzing allocation decisions from U. S. bilateral and multilateral aid agencies. It finds that strategic considerations influence both bilateral and multilateral aid. Donor influence over multilateral aid allocations requires a rethinking of how strategic <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> pursued. Improvements to the models of <b>aid</b> flows <b>are</b> offered, and a preliminary empirical analysis is attempted. It is found that the dynamics of strategic uses of <b>aid</b> <b>are</b> more complex that previous studies have concluded. The impact of these findings on the flows and efficacy of <b>aid</b> <b>is</b> discussed. Honors Thesis, Department of Economic...|$|R
