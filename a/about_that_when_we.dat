40|$|This {{workshop}} {{explores the}} nature of the child and young adult reader, and looks at who might write for them, and why, and how they might set <b>about</b> <b>that</b> task. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> write for anyone, we need to include a story arc, the characters need to be rounded and believable, the writer should show, not tell, and every word should be relevant, either carrying the plot forward or showing more about the characters. We also need to make our writing suitable for our reader. Children will tend to be less forgiving than adults, and even experienced young adult readers will not wait for the text to become interesting. It must engage them from the very beginning and hold their attention throughout...|$|R

You know, our sound has always been raw and gritty, ominous and moody... And, while this time we still {{wanted it to be}} raw and dark, we also wanted it to be more UPTEMPO. Because, in {{terms of the}} live setting, whenever we do songs that are more uptempo and aggressive people do love them and it makes for a great SHOW. So, while making this album, we definitely had the intention of making songs that would translate well to the live aspect of what Cypress Hill is <b>about.</b> So <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> play these songs out, we're gonna get a magnificent reaction from the crowd!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was <b>about</b> <b>that</b> time <b>when</b> <b>we</b> {{first had}} a ten-o'clock night train from Boston to New York. Train used {{to start at}} nine, and lag along round by Springfield, {{and get into the}} old Twenty-sixth Street Station here at six in the morning, where they let you sleep as long as you liked. They call you up now at half-past five, and, if you don't turn out, they haul you back to Mott Haven, or New Haven, I'm not sure which. I used to go into Boston and turn in at the old Worcester Depot, as we called it then, just about the time the train began to move, and I usually got a fine night's rest {{in the course of the}} nine or ten hours we were on the way to New York; it didn't seem quite the same after we began saying Albany Depot: {{shortened}} up the run, somehow.|$|R

At the period of their co-working the relationships were purely professional. In one of her interviews Baturina remembers: “We never even thought <b>about</b> anything like <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were working together, it all happened much later”. Baturina and Luzhkov married in 1991. The next year he became mayor of Moscow. In 2010 he was dismissed by President Dmitry Medvedev amidst still unproven accusations of corruption and mismanagement voiced on state run television. Yury himself had at one time been tipped to run for president, though he never did.|$|R

40|$|Modelling {{became one}} of the primary tools of {{economic}} research in the 20 th century and economists understand their mathematical models as giving some kind of representation of the economic world, one adequate enough for the purpose of reasoning <b>about</b> <b>that</b> world. But <b>when</b> <b>we</b> look at examples of how non-analogical models were first built in economics, both the process of making representations and aspects of the representing relation remain opaque. Like early astronomers, economists have to imagine how the hidden parts of their world are arranged and to make images, that is, create models, to represent how they work. The case of the Edgeworth Box, a widely used model in 20 th century economics, provides a good example to explore the role of imagination and images in the process of making representations of the econom...|$|R
500|$|The group {{purposely}} {{cut short}} {{the amount of}} time set aside for recording the album, and did not notify its label before beginning work on the record.

40|$|Nishida Kitaro expresses his motive fot {{philosophy}} {{by using}} a term "the sorrow oflife. " It is said that parting ofhis folks brought about the emotion to him, and then, he realized the fact that everyone is destined to die to be ashes in vase sooner or later, and that the dead petsons nevet come to life again. It is certain that he worked out his philosophical system in considering that fact. And so, hitherto researchers have pointed out the relation between Nishida's philosophy and "the sorrow of life," {{but it is not}} so easy as we think to find out the specific connection between them. For instance, scholars have so far mentioned that Nishida had shifted the emphasis of his thinking to the theme on history after the representative treatise about his philosophy of other "I-Thou;" however, they have seldom grappled squarely with the problem about the connection between Nishida's philosophy of other deeply concerned with "sorrow of Efe" and his peculiar theory of history. So, we can say {{that it is necessary to}} investigate the left problem <b>about</b> <b>that</b> connection <b>when</b> <b>we</b> intend to grasp Nishida's view of death and life impeccably and to consider Nishida's thought flawlessly. In this paper, to substantiate this idea, I will take the following process. In the first section, I seek to seize the constitution of Nishida's original theory of history, and to examine the import of each concept in his theory. And then, in the second section, I elucidate the connection between his philosophy of other and the theory of history through an examination of his treatise "I-Thou" mainly. And finally, from this study, I will confirm what Nishida's view ofdeath and life is. 論文 Article...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{findings}} of a survey among Dutch households (as part of the DNB Household Survey in 2003) about many aspects (expectations, concerns, attitude and preferences) of their pensions and the old-age-arrangements in the Netherlands. We explore whether the outcomes are related to specific financial and non-financial household or personal characteristics. A clear majority of the Dutch public expects public pension schemes to be retrenched and rejects reforms that infringe on what they regard as acquired rights. One would rather like to pay higher contributions until the age of 65. The divergence in preferences towards retrenchment measures across generations indicates that intergenerational risk sharing is not something natural. The public prefers to have their pension buildup managed by pension funds and would accept having to pay higher contributions in exchange for guaranteed benefits. Yet, a substantial minority advocates a greater freedom of choice. Surprisingly, this preference for freedom is not linked to particular household characteristics, nor does it reflect the particular interest of those who already have third pillar pension provisions. Many, however, are as yet not concerned about their pension rights, adopting a "we'll see <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> come to that" attitude. This manifests itself in a substantial lack of knowledge about one's own personal pension arrangements, notably for young generations, women, low-skilled workers and people out of work. public pensions; second pillar pensions; household survey; risk attitude and preferences...|$|E

But we all know that we can easily pick this up in two or three years, there are breaks in the stories. We could pick it up, say, four years later. If Bryan is up for it, we will all go for it." [...] In June 2016, Fuller stated, [...] "The cast is game, I'm game, it's just a matter of finding the right time where everybody's schedules sync up, but I would love to continue to tell the story with Hugh Dancy and Mads Mikkelsen. They're such fantastic collaborators, and one of the most satisfying actor-showrunner relationships I've ever had in this industry. So I would love to continue this story." [...] He also revealed other information dealing with rights: [...] "Two years after the last airing of the show, we can investigate our options ... August 2017 is <b>when</b> <b>we</b> can actually start talking <b>about</b> it. <b>That's</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> would have to see what the rights are for the character and for the story, and see who's interested and how we get it done. I have the story, and the cast is excited for the story, so we're ready to go if somebody wants to go." [...] In December 2016, Fuller confirmed his plans for a Silence of the Lambs miniseries in an interview on the Blumhouse Productions podcast, stating, [...] "I think the film adaptation is a perfect film, but there are a lot of interesting nooks and crannies in that book to explore in a television series."
