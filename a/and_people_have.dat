5|$|The finetooth shark {{has never}} been implicated in an attack on humans. However, when caught, this shark thrashes and snaps at {{anything}} within range, <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been bitten attempting to handle it. Finetooth sharks are used for human consumption fresh or dried and salted. Other than off the southeastern United States, this species is of little commercial importance: it is small and occurs in water too shallow for most commercial and recreational fisheries, and is generally too fast-swimming to be caught by shrimp trawlers. Small numbers are taken incidentally by floating longlines and on hook-and-line. This species is susceptible to overfishing due to its low reproductive rate, and to habitat degradation due to its inshore habits.|$|E
5|$|Each year, {{thousands}} of outdoor enthusiasts attempt to summit Mount Adams. The false summits and broad summit plateau have disheartened many climbers as this inscription {{on a rock}} at Piker’s Peak indicates. “You are a piker {{if you think this}} is the summit. Don’t crab, the mountain was here first.” Crampons and ice axes are needed on many routes because of glaciers and the route’s steepness. Aside from crevasses on the more difficult glacier routes, the biggest hazard is the loose rocks and boulders which are easily dislodged and a severe hazard for climbers below. These falling rocks are especially dangerous for climbers on the precipitous east faces and the steep headwalls of the north and west sides. Routes in those areas should only be climbed early in the season under as ideal conditions as can be had. Other hazards faced by climbers on Adams include sudden storms and clouds, avalanches, altitude sickness, and inexperience. Climbing Mount Adams can be dangerous {{for a variety of reasons}} <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> died in pursuit of the summit while many others have had close calls.|$|E

There were restrictions to tourism during World War II and the mid-to-late 1960s - other than those two periods - travel accounts and guide books have been produced regularly.

500|$|Cuba's burgeoning tourist {{industry}} {{of the late}} 1990s benefited from this rebirth of interest. According to The Economist, [...] "In the tourist quarters of Old Havana it can seem at times as if every Cuban with a guitar has come out to sing the songs that Buena Vista made famous. It's {{as if you were}} to go to Liverpool and find bands singing Beatles songs on every street corner." [...] The songs Buena Vista sings are often not their own compositions. Some songs they sing have long been popular in Cuba <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> always performed them in the street. Despite the appeal of the [...] "Buena Vista" [...] ambience to tourists, Cubans themselves were less aware of the [...] "Buena Vista Social Club" [...] than international music listeners. This was due to the foreign nature of the production, and the dominance of modern Timba, Songo and other musical forms on the island, such as reggaetón by luminaries such as Raul Zeballos, the creator of the genre. Some explain that Buena Vista did not impact the Cuban audience, as they were not creating anything new; they were just playing the same songs that Cubans know and have been playing for many years.|$|E

This room full of chaps smoking enormous cigars and drinking martinis and this young girl reciting the Lords' Prayer." [...] In the 1940s, producer Earl St. John was found drunk at the hotel; writer and co-producer Eric Ambler promptly sent him back to John Davis in a taxi with a board around his neck with the words [...] "Return to John Davis with compliments". Ray Bradbury stayed at the hotel during the filming of Moby Dick (1956). In 1964, John Lennon was invited to attend one of the Foyle Literary Luncheons after he received acclaim for his book In His Own Write. John and Cynthia had not realised the notability of the event and attended with a hangover, with Lennon disappointing the crowd which had gathered at the Dorchester who were expecting a speech, simply muttering [...] "Thank you very much, it's been a pleasure". Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor were regulars at the hotel throughout the 1960s and 1970s and spent their honeymoon in the Oliver Messel suite in March 1964.
