5000|$|In recent years, many indexed annuities can {{be issued}} with a rider {{designed}} to supply a lifetime income payment to the policyholder {{that does not}} require annuitization, thus leaving the policyholder {{in control of the}} balance of the account. These [...] "income riders" [...] are calculated separately than the indexed annuity itself, however, they use the same initial premium figures for each calculation. An [...] "income rider" [...] generally will provide a specified accumulation rate which is guaranteed for a certain period of years. The [...] "income rider" [...] calculations create an [...] "income pool" [...] which is strictly an <b>accounting</b> <b>figure</b> that cannot be accessed as a single lump sum by the policyholder or beneficiary. The [...] "income pool" [...] continues to grow annually at the specified accumulation rate until such time the guarantee period expires or the policyholder opts to begin taking [...] "lifetime income payments" [...] from the account. Once [...] "lifetime income payments" [...] begin, the [...] "income pool" [...] stops accumulating, and the value of the income pool is used to determine the amount of income that will be paid out annually (it can usually be paid monthly, quarterly or semi-annually as well). The amount of income produced by the [...] "income rider" [...] will depend on several factors, primarily the age of the policyholder at the time they opt for income, the specified accumulation rate and the length of time the [...] "income pool" [...] has been given to accumulate. Each time an income payment is paid to the policyholder, the indexed annuity account value is decreased by that same amount. [...] "Income riders" [...] that provide lifetime income are generally used as a means of allowing a policyholder to supplement their income, especially in retirement, without the possibility of outliving their money because even if the indexed annuity's account value falls to zero, the income payment from the [...] "income rider" [...] will continue until the death of the policyholder. If the policyholder dies and funds remain in the indexed annuity account value, those funds would be paid to the beneficiary(-ies). Some of these income riders are offered with no fees, while others carry an annual fee (generally 1% or less) which is deducted directly from the indexed annuity account value.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} stock prices and <b>accounting</b> <b>figures,</b> primarily the book value of equity and earnings, {{as well as the}} market perception of accounting choices implemented by companies. Market event studies from late sixties have initiated numerous of researches, and the majority of contemporary results were consistent with strong belief in the market efficiency theory. The book value of equity and earnings have been proved to have the highest explanatory power of future stock prices. Other accounting-related issues, like inventory methods or accounting for business combination, were proven to have reliable impact on the stock prices. Moreover, the cash flow implications triggered by the accounting change are not an indispensable condition to influence the stock price level. Although a great body of research has treated the relationship between accounting choices and stock prices, a clear-cut mechanism is not well specified. The evidence is inconsistent, and the consequences of accounting change are difficult to measure. However, the <b>accounting</b> <b>figures</b> included in financial statements remain the most important measure of the companies’ performance. Due to the economic and technical progress, which considerably modified the structure of companies and the environment in which they operate, further studies are advisable {{in order to maintain the}} reliability of <b>accounting</b> <b>figures</b> on significant level...|$|R
50|$|Fundamentally based indexes are indices {{in which}} stocks are {{weighted}} {{by one of}} many economic fundamental factors, especially <b>accounting</b> <b>figures</b> which are commonly used when performing corporate valuation, or by a composite of several fundamental factors. A potential benefit with composite fundamental indices is that they might average out specific sector biases {{which may be the}} case when only using one fundamental factor. A key belief behind the fundamental index methodology is that underlying corporate accounting/valuation figures are more accurate estimators of a company's intrinsic value, rather than the listed market value of the company, i.e. that one should buy and sell companies in line with their <b>accounting</b> <b>figures</b> rather than according to their current market prices. In this sense fundamental indexing is linked to so-called fundamental analysis.|$|R
40|$|CURRENT VERSION August 8, 2008 Firms {{listed on}} stock exchanges within the European Economic Area are {{required}} to report consolidated financial statements according to IFRS from 2005. The firms that adopted IFRS in 2005 were also required to restate their 2004 financial statements from national GAAP to provide comparable <b>accounting</b> <b>figures.</b> These two sets of financial statements for 2004 are thus based on identical underlying economic activities and are fully specified according to two different reporting regimes. Our sample consists of 145 restatements from NGAAP to IFRS for firms listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange in Norway. We test whether the IFRS <b>accounting</b> <b>figures</b> correlate more strongly with stock market values than the corresponding NGAAP figures. We find little evidence of increased value-relevance after adopting IFRS when comparing and evaluating the two regimes unconditionally. On the other hand, when evaluating {{the change in the}} <b>accounting</b> <b>figures</b> from NGAAP to IFRS, we find evidence that the reconcilement adjustments to IFRS are marginally value-relevant due to increased relevance of the balance sheet and the normalized net operating income. By weighting our sample by firm size, intangible asset intensity and profitability, we learn that the increased value-relevance of the net operating income stems from different reporting of intangible assets. Since more intangible assets are capitalized according to IFRS than NGAAP, our finding is consistent with the view that capitalizing intangible assets is more value-relevant than expensing them as incurred or through goodwill amortization...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue about}} {{the degree of}} {{subjectivity}} incidental to financial statements is topical, although {{it has long been}} studied and debated. Indeed, such issue recurs any time new accounting rules or standards are issued. And, of course, it recurs in case of a complete renovation of the accounting system of reference, such as the one that took place in Europe in 2005, when all listed companies were required to repeal their national accounting rules and GAAP, and to adopt IFRS for the preparation of their consolidated financial statements. This study focuses on such transition with specific reference to the Italian context and explores three interconnected issues: a) identification of the changes in the evaluation criteria – from the Italian regulations and GAAP to IFRS – which actually impact on the financial statements presented by Italian companies in the year of transition; b) appreciation of the importance of such impacts, based on (1) how often each adjustment recurs; (2) whether they determine an increase or decrease in <b>accounting</b> <b>figures</b> and (3) how relevant their effects are on the main <b>accounting</b> <b>figures,</b> namely net earnings and net capital; c) discussion about the managerial discretion introduced by the most impacting evaluation criteria identified, in comparison with the Italian provisions and GAAP previously applied. The overall analysis demonstrates that IFRS introduction determined wide impacts on financial statements, affecting most assets and liabilities, but its impacts on <b>accounting</b> <b>figures</b> were less significant than could be expected.

40|$|While some of {{the modern}} {{performance}} measures used in managerial accounting rely on cash flow based figures others try {{to take advantage of}} the information content of <b>accounting</b> <b>figures.</b> However, whether the additional information content in the accrual components of earnings improves the internal performance measurement is an open empirical question. To shed light on this question, I examine the correlation between operating cash flows and earnings with firm's total shareholder returns. Using fixed firm effects regression methods for a large sample of German listed firms covering some 5, 000 firm years, the analysis shows that generally operating cash flow and earnings are both positively correlated with total shareholder return. However, with increasing information asymmetry earnings become less correlated with the firm's stock market performance and operating cash flows dominate earnings in explaining total shareholder return (and vice versa). These results suggest that, the information content of <b>accounting</b> <b>figures</b> is only relevant in settings characterized by low information asymmetries and, thus, there is no one-size-fits-all performance measure for managerial accounting purposes.

40|$|Previous management-control {{studies have}} {{regarded}} responsibility accounting as the assigned formal authorities of individuals underpinned by other organisational structures. The financial success of, for example, projects, is evaluated through various business ratios extracted from <b>accounting</b> <b>figures.</b> Also, performance feedback to individual managers who are held responsible {{is crucial to}} this view. However, what being responsible means is not clarified. This paper reports on a yearlong study of project management at Ericsson Microwave Systems AB in Sweden. The study is of an ethnographical character {{and is based on}} a series of interviews with members of a project team and on observations of their meetings. Within the paper the following question is addressed: How is responsibility constructed within companies, and {{what is the role of}} accounting information in this regard? The purpose of the study is to enhance the understanding of what types of responsibility constructs organisational members develop, and the role of <b>accounting</b> <b>figures</b> in this respect. A distinction is made between correlated and superimposed control in order to clarify the decisive difference between formal authority and responsibility. The findings indicate greater complexity than mainstream research attributes to accounting and its link to responsibility. By means of a number of illustrations, we show how constructs of responsibility reflect a tension between expectations of (1) what one wants to do versus what one ought to do, (2) responsibility versus formal assigned authority, and finally (3) co-ordination of one’s own needs with the needs of others versus securing one’s self-interest. Contrary to mainstream ideas, in our case <b>accounting</b> <b>figures</b> played a secondary role in project management. However, accounting is an important point of reference for peoples’ actions and for their responsibility. Our conclusions are not in line with previous claims about legitimating and dominating being the most significant aspects of accountability situations.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether the use of commercial-in-confidence {{arrangements}} within the public sector allows the deliberate manipulation of <b>accounting</b> <b>figures</b> to generate support for the privatisation agenda. Design/methodology/approach – A case study is presented of an Australian power entity, United Energy, where the privatisation was subject to commercial-in-confidence restrictions and differing opinions as to the accuracy of the entity's financial accounts during the privatisation process. It examines many of the key “commercial-in-confidence” documents, which are now available through parliamentary and official document sources, together with pre- and post-privatisation financial statements. Findings – The <b>accounting</b> <b>figures</b> were shaped to support a privatisation agenda and this was obscured by the commercial-in-confidence provision. Some attempts were made to use accounting arrangements to reduce federal taxes but this failed. A substantial element of the reported sale price represented internal transfers between the state-owned entity and the government with the actual price paid by the purchaser being substantially lower than the reported price. The price paid was based on the financial statements which were openly challenged by the Auditor-General. The paper strongly supports the contention that manipulation of <b>accounting</b> <b>figures</b> occurs under commercial-in-confidence privatisations. Research limitations/implications – This was limited to one example at one time. Further work is needed on other settings. Practical implications – The paper challenges the success claimed for the privatisation process and for the social benefits of privatisation by tender. Originality/value – There was little evidence of a substantial improvement in financial performance following privatisation or that the pre-privatisation performance was substantially boosted to support the privatisation agenda. It did show that the accounting served political ends. Auditing, Australia, Electricity, Privatization, Public sector organizations...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to study both the {{information}} content of <b>accounting</b> <b>figures</b> and the speed at which the new information is incorporated into stock prices. Design/methodology/approach – The sample is composed of 117 overnight announcements published by Reuters during the period 2001 - 2003. For every date, the event is classified into one of three categories: good news, bad news or no news. The paper uses intraday event study methodology to examine market reaction just before and just after the event. Findings – The intraday analysis reveals several results. Firstly, investors react positively to good news and negatively to bad news. Secondly, abnormal returns dissipate within 15 ?min. Thirdly, prices converge to equilibrium more quickly for good news than for bad news. Fourthly, we present evidence of price reversal 30 ?min following bad news announcements. Finally, earnings releases are accompanied by a rise in volume which remains even after the equilibrium price is attained. Research limitations/implications – Price discovery is analyzed only in the stock market. It is pertinent to verify if the option market and foreign markets can contribute to the incorporation of new information into stock prices. Practical implications – This work can help investors to determine their trading strategies around earnings announcements. The paper shows that it is not possible to realize trading profits after 15 ?min following the time of the announcement. Originality/value – The study contributes to both financial accounting and microstructure literature. First, it focuses on the information content of <b>accounting</b> <b>figures</b> using very short horizon (intraday analysis).
