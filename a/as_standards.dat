5|$|Although the originators {{intended}} {{to devise a}} system that was equally accessible to all, it proved necessary to use prototype units {{in the custody of}} national or local authorities <b>as</b> <b>standards.</b> Control of the prototype units of measure was maintained by the later French governments until 1875, when it was passed to an international intergovernmental organisation, the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM).|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{religious}} {{language has}} been explained as via negativa, analogy, symbolism, or myth, {{each of which}} describes a way of talking about God in human terms. The via negativa {{is a way of}} referring to God according to what God is not; analogy uses human qualities <b>as</b> <b>standards</b> against which to compare divine qualities; symbolism is used non-literally to describe otherwise ineffable experiences; and a mythological interpretation of religion attempts to reveal fundamental truths behind religious stories. Alternative explanations of religious language cast it as having political, performative, or imperative functions.|$|E
5|$|The {{metric system}} was first {{implemented}} during the French Revolution (1790s) {{with just the}} metre and kilogram <b>as</b> <b>standards</b> of length and mass respectively. In the 1830s Carl Friedrich Gauss laid the foundations for a coherent system based on length, mass, and time. In the 1860s a group working {{under the auspices of}} the British Association for the Advancement of Science formulated the requirement for a coherent system of units with base units and derived units. The inclusion of electrical units into the system was hampered by the customary use of more than one set of units, until 1900 when Giovanni Giorgi identified the need to define one single electrical quantity as a fourth base quantity alongside the original three base quantities.|$|E

25|$|By {{the mid-1990s}} {{the advent of}} 3D video cards and the {{introduction}} of Windows 95 meant that {{to keep up with the}} marketplace Game-Maker would need great changes both in concept and in coding.

25|$|Penthouse, {{started by}} Bob Guccione in England in 1965, took a {{different}} approach. Women looked indirectly at the camera, {{as if they were}} going about their private idylls. This change of emphasis was influential in erotic depictions of women. Penthouse was also the first magazine to publish pictures that included pubic hair and , both of which were considered beyond the bounds of the erotic and in the realm of pornography at the time. In the late 1960s, magazines began to move into more explicit displays often focusing on the buttocks <b>as</b> <b>standards</b> of what could be legally depicted and what readers wanted to see changed. By the 1970s, they were focusing on the pubic area and eventually, by the 1990s, featured sexual penetration, lesbianism and homosexuality, group sex, masturbation, and fetishes in the more hard-core magazines such as Hustler.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} basic {{principles}} are accepted by scientists <b>as</b> <b>standards</b> for {{determining whether a}} body of knowledge, method, or practice is scientific. Experimental results should be reproducible and verified by other researchers. These principles are intended to ensure experiments can be reproduced measurably given the same conditions, allowing further investigation {{to determine whether a}} hypothesis or theory related to given phenomena is both valid and reliable. Standards require the scientific method to be applied throughout, and bias to be controlled for or eliminated through randomization, fair sampling procedures, blinding of studies, and other methods. All gathered data, including the experimental or environmental conditions, are expected to be documented for scrutiny and made available for peer review, allowing further experiments or studies to be conducted to confirm or falsify results. Statistical quantification of significance, confidence, and error are also important tools for the scientific method.|$|E
25|$|In the Internet of things, {{the precise}} {{geographic}} {{location of a}} thing—and also the precise geographic dimensions of a thing—will be critical. Therefore, facts about a thing, such as its location in time and space, have been less critical to track because the person processing the information can {{decide whether or not}} that information was important to the action being taken, and if so, add the missing information (or decide to not take the action). (Note that some things in the Internet of things will be sensors, and sensor location is usually important.) The GeoWeb and Digital Earth are promising applications that become possible when things can become organized and connected by location. However, the challenges that remain include the constraints of variable spatial scales, the need to handle massive amounts of data, and an indexing for fast search and neighbor operations. In the Internet of things, if things are able to take actions on their own initiative, this human-centric mediation role is eliminated. Thus, the time-space context that we as humans take for granted must be given a central role in this information ecosystem. Just <b>as</b> <b>standards</b> {{play a key role in}} the Internet and the Web, geospatial standards will play a key role in the Internet of things.|$|E

500|$|Lord Fraser {{advocated}} {{that when}} [...] "construction management" [...] contracts were used, civil servants or local government officials should evaluate {{the risks of}} such a contract and set out {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of embarking upon such a route before their political superiors. Alongside that recommendation, Lord Fraser stated that independent advisors should be retained and have the ability to communicate their advice to ministers, without those views being [...] "filtered" [...] by public officials. Similarly, where civil servants are part of large project management contracts, clear guidelines of governance should be set out and be as rigorous <b>as</b> <b>standards</b> applied in the private sector.|$|E

The most recorded 1920s standard is Hoagy Carmichael and Mitchell Parish's [...] "Stardust". Several songs written by Broadway composers in the 1920s have become standards, such as George and Ira Gershwin's [...] "The Man I Love" [...] (1924), Irving Berlin's [...] "Blue Skies" [...] (1927) and Cole Porter's [...] "What Is This Thing Called Love?" [...] (1929). However, {{it was not}} until the 1930s that musicians became comfortable with the harmonic and melodic sophistication of Broadway tunes and started including them regularly in their repertoire.|$|E

2500|$|The Aquila was {{the eagle}} {{standard}} of a Roman legion, carried {{by a special}} grade legionary known as an Aquilifer. One eagle standard was carried by each legion. Pliny the Elder (H.N. x.16) enumerates five animals displayed on [...] Roman military ensigns: the eagle, the wolf, the minotaur, the horse, and the boar. In the second consulship of Gaius Marius (104 BC) the four quadrupeds were laid aside <b>as</b> <b>standards,</b> the eagle being alone retained. It was made of silver, or bronze, with outstretched wings, but was probably of a relatively small size, since a standard-bearer (signifer) under Julius Caesar is said in circumstances of danger to have wrenched the eagle from its staff and concealed it {{in the folds of}} his girdle.|$|E
