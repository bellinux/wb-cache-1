40|$|Loop {{heat pipe}} is a passive {{two-phase}} heat transport device that is gaining importance {{as a part}} of spacecraft thermal control systems and also in applications (such as in <b>avionic</b> <b>cooling</b> and submarines). Hard fill of a loop heat pipe occurs when the compensation chamber is full of liquid. A theoretical study is undertaken to investigate the issues underlying the loop beat pipe hard-fill phenomenon. The results of the study suggest that the mass of charge and the presence of a bayonet have significant impact on the loop heat pipe operation. With a largern mass of charge, a loop heat pipe hard fills at a lower heat load. As the heat load increases, there is a steep rise in the loop heat pipe operating temperature. In a loop heat pipe with a saturated compensation chamber, and also in a hard-filled loop heat pipe without a bayonet, the temperature of the compensation chamber and that of the liquid core are nearly equal. When a loop heat pipe with a bayonet hard fills, the compensation chamber and the evaporator core temperatures are different...|$|R

By contrast, the Gemini avionics did not require air cooling, allowing the spacewalking astronaut to exit and re-enter the depressurized cabin through an open hatch. Because of this, the American and Soviet space programs developed different definitions {{for the duration of}} an EVA. The Soviet (now Russian) definition begins when the outer airlock hatch is open and the cosmonaut is in vacuum. An American EVA began when the astronaut had at least his head outside the spacecraft.

40|$|In modern aircraft, one of {{the most}} {{difficult}} issues has been how to provide <b>avionics</b> with adequate <b>cooling.</b> Future versions of the fighter aircraft JAS 39 Gripen is equipped with new applications that have increased heat loads. In previous versions of the JAS 39 Gripen <b>avionics</b> was <b>cooled</b> by zero degree air and fuel, but in the next version a liquid loop will be installed to cool the new radar. The fluid in the liquid loop is cooled to proper temperature by pressurized bleed air from the engine which is cooled by ram air. The air to <b>cool</b> the <b>avionics</b> is produced the same way and this is a very expensive process for the airplane which lowers its performance. It is important to minimize the production of cooling air and therefore three new adjustable valves that provide various components of cooling air are installed in the next version of the JAS 39 Gripen. The cooled and pressure controlled air from the engine is distributed between different avionic shelves, each containing a set of components. Depending on the type of tasks performed and current flight mode of the aircraft the requirement of functions which should be active varies and therefore also the <b>cooling</b> demand to <b>avionics.</b> The first part of this thesis studies the overall priority of how the engine bleed shall be used. This part of the thesis results in a decision basis for the distribution of cooling air to be regulated in the absence of full cooling capacity. The amount of cooling which must be distributed to the radar is proportional to its developed power which varies widely depending on the radarâ€™s operational mode. Since the pump which determines the liquid flow velocity operates at a constant speed is the regulation of cooling to the radar is controlled by varying the bleed air flow into the heat exchanger which cools the fluid and thus the temperature of the fluid has when it reaches the radar. This part of the thesis creates a control algorithm for controlling the airflow into the heat exchanger. The regulation keeps the fluid inlet temperature to the radar within the range of + 25 Â± 5 Ëš C and the gradient of the temperature less than 0. 5 Â° C per second. The PI-controller with the feed-forward filter succeeded in controlling the temperature of the liquid as it reached the radar within + 25 Â± 1 Â° C, the temperature gradient requirement, 0. 5 Â° C per second, was also passed in all flight cases which were used to evaluate the controller. The PI-controller with feed-forward has a low convergence time and no static error. It also performs well when the measurement signals contain a lot of noise because of the controllers integrated low pass filter. Â  The three new adjustable valves saves 12 to 97 g/s of cooling air for the different valve positions studied in this thesis, this corresponds to 9 - 70 % of the total amount of controllable air to the avionics. Since the production of cooling air is a costly process for the aircraft, the use of all 3 valves is recommended...|$|R

Cooling schemes such as pool boiling, detachable heat sinks, channel flow boiling, micro-channel and mini-channel heat sinks, jet-impingement, and sprays, are discussed and compared relative to heat dissipation potential, reliability, and packaging concerns. It is demonstrated that, while different cooling options can {{be tailored to}} {{the specific needs of}} in-dividual applications, system considerations always play a para-mount role in determining the most suitable cooling scheme. It is also shown that extensive fundamental electronic cooling knowl-edge has been amassed over the past two decades.

40|$|Deciding what {{to include}} in a model {{is the essence of}} {{physical}} modeling. If this kind of decisions is done incorrectly, it results in a model that is both less accurate and offers less performance than others. This paper presents a method to deal with these decision problems and quantify the results. A workflow is proposed, where the modeler first builds a model and includes several sets of replaceable subsystems. A multi-objective optimization algorithm then identifies selections of subsystems that are pareto optimal regarding accuracy and computation time. Finally, the modeler can pick one of these selections based on the modeling intent. An implementation of the proposed method using Modelica and Python is presented and potential pitfalls are explained. Special consideration is given to the quantification of the error or distance between models of different structures. The method is then illustrated by the use of two examples, one of them a complex model of an <b>avionics</b> <b>cooling</b> system cold plate.

40|$|Cooling of {{electronic}} components {{is one of}} the most important issues concerned in the electronic industry for design of equipment. Maintaining the temperature of an electronic device within its safe operating temperature limits is essential to operate the equipment safely with proper functionality. According to the Arrhenious law of failure rate, for a device with activation energy 0. 65 eV, every 10 Â°C increase in temperature doubles the failure rate. Recent miniaturisation of components and high device heat dissipation rates lead to high heat fluxes, which cause temperature rise. Hence, there is an increasing need for research to achieve high heat removal rates and optimal design. Several cooling techniques are used for cooling {{of electronic}}s based on the application and cooling rate requirements. Air-cooling of electronics has a wide range of applications due to its greater reliability, simplicity, easy maintenance, low cost, easy availability of coolant (air), and light weight. Air-cooling is also free from boiling and dripping problems. Air-cooling is used in applications such as <b>avionics,</b> <b>cooling</b> of personal computers, cooling of data centers, and in automobile electronics. In a typical electronic cooling application, cooling fluid is driven by the combination of external pressure forces and buoyancy forces. Based on the relative contribution of these forces towards the total driving force, the cooling techniques can be categorized as forced, natural or mixed convection cooling. However, in many of the electronic cooling situations, such as in the applications with very high heat fluxes, tall Printed Circuits Boards (PCBs) with low forced convection velocity, and in large scale applications such as data centers, the contributions of the buoyancy forces and external pressure forces for the total driving force are comparable, which results in a mixed convection situation. In the present study, mixed convection in vertical channels heated with five heating configurations, which represent typical electronic cooling applications, is studied numerically. The five different heating configurations are channels with flush-mounted continuous heater, flush-mounted strip heaters, flush-mounted square block heaters, protruding rib heaters and protruding square heaters. The first three configurations are categorised as flush-mounted heating configurations and the latter two configurations are categorised as protruded heating configurations. One of the channel walls represents the substrate on which the heaters are mounted and the heat sources represent the heat generating electronic components. Heat transfer under steady state conditions is considered in the study. The study includes laminar as well as turbulent heat transfer. For a systematic study of mixed convection, an analytical or semi-analytical formulation is desirable for a simplified model, as it can highlight the effect of relevant non-dimensional parameters on the heat transfer characteristics of a system. The results of a simplified model can be used for benchmarking the results of practical situations. Hence, before numerically solving the governing equations for mixed convection in channels, mixed convection boundary layer flows over a heated vertical plate is considered for study. Perturbation technique is used to solve the boundary layer equations with non-isothermal boundary conditions. The perturbation analysis is carried out for an arbitrarily variation of wall temperature or heat flux. Subsequently, the results are extended to find heat transfer rates in the cases of power-law variation of temperature and heat flux, as special cases. It is always required to design a cooling system to remove maximum possible amount of heat, keeping the device temperature within its safe operating limits. Hence, optimization of heat transfer in boundary layers is attempted, whose results can be used as guidelines to achieve optimal heat transfer in practical situations of channels with continuous as well as discrete heating. Similarity analysis is used for the optimization of heat distribution in boundary layer flows. In the similarity analysis, in the search of optimal heat transfer from the plate, the boundary layer equations are solved for various power-law heat flux variations and the appropriate power-law variation of optimal heat transfer is found. Similarly, the heat flux variation for optimal heat transfer is found for the cases of natural and forced convection, as they are the limiting cases of mixed convection. In the numerical part of the study, the generalised three-dimensional governing equations for the five heating configurations considered for the study are solved numerically with appropriate boundary conditions. Separation of natural, forced and mixed convection regimes is carried out in all the heating configurations using a criterion based on individual contributions of pressure force and buoyancy force towards the total driving force for the fluid movement. Heat transfer characteristics are studied in laminar as well as turbulent regimes in terms of parameters such as Grashof number, Reynolds number, Nusselt number, maximum temperature of heaters, pressure drop across the channel, and so on. The influence of conjugate effects on the heat transfer characteristics is studied by varying the substrate thermal conductivity. A systematic comparison of various effects such as the effect of discrete heating in plain channels, effect of discrete heating in channels with heated ribs, and the effect of three-dimensional protrusions on heat transfer, is achieved. The parameters in the individual configurations, which affect heat transfer, are explored for better cooling solutions. Optimal heat distribution among the heaters to minimise the temperature of the hottest heater for a given total amount of heat generation in the channel is found for all the channel configurations, which are heated either continuously or discretely. In the process of finding the optimal heat distribution among heaters, guidelines are taken from the optimal heat distribution in boundary layer flows. Compared to usual optimization approaches such as genetic algorithm, the present physics based optimisation procedure requires fewer runs to arrive at the optimal distribution. The fluid flow characteristics in all the three configurations with flush-mounted heaters are found to be similar. However, heat transfer characteristics in channels with flush-mounted square heaters differ from those in the other two flush-mounted channel configurations. Hot spots with higher temperatures are found at heater locations in channels with flush-mounted square heaters. The effect of substrate follows the same trend in all the flush-mounted configurations. At lower thermal conductivities, the maximum temperature decreases sharply with increasing thermal conductivity. However, at higher conductivities, the influence reduces. In all the flush-mounted configurations, heat transfer will not be influenced by substrate thermal conductivity increment at conductivities more than 150 times the fluid thermal conductivity. The fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics in channels with protruded heaters differ significantly from those in channels with flush-mounted heaters. The protrusions in the channels interact with the fluid flow and make it different from that of smooth channels. In turn, the protrusions affect heat transfer characteristics in the channels. The influence of the protrusions on the heat transfer and locations of hot spots in the domain is examined. Effect of thermal conductivity in channels with protruded square heaters is similar to that in channels with flush-mounted heaters. However, conductivity in channels with protruded rib heaters affects the heat transfer in a wider range of conductivities than in the other heating configurations. Unlike in the other configurations, at low thermal conductivities, maximum temperature does not drop sharply with increase of conductivity. In channels with protruded square heaters, staggering arrangement of heaters results in higher heat transfer rates than those with in-line heater arrangement. In all the configurations, pressure drop is found to be independent of Grashof number in the range of heat dissipation rates considered in the study. Heat transfer rates in turbulent region are much higher than the heat transfer rates in laminar regime. However, the pressure drops encountered are also high in the turbulent regime. Turbulent heat transfer results in a more uniform temperature distribution in channels. The cooling performances of the individual configurations are compared. For a given pressure drop the cooling performances decreases in the order of flush-mounted strip heating, protruded square heating, flush-mounted square heating, protruded rib heating. For a given inlet fluid flow rate, the cooling performances decreases in the order of protruded rib heating, protruded square heating, flush-mounted square heating, flush-mounted strip heating. However, for a given inlet fluid flow rate, the pressure drop increases in the order of increasing cooling performance...|$|E

A bespoke test rig provides experimental thermal comparisons of an aluminium and embedded VCHS avionic heat exchanger.

The VCHS dramatically reduces thermal variation in circuit card and avionic heat exchanger exhaust temperatures. Increased isothermalisation of the heat exchanger greatly increases effective heat transfer area in comparison to a traditional aluminium chassis. The VCHS acts as a very effective thermal buffer between the avionic circuit cards and coolant airflow, allowing a more predictable avionic thermal behaviour irrespective of circuit card architecture. The improved heat rejection capability allows either a substantial increase in avionic growth capacity (increased power output for a fixed exhaust temperature) or a substantial reduction in mass flow rate (reduced demand on vehicle thermal management system).

While the increasing power density of avionic components requires a greater heat removal capacity for a given geometric module size, supplementary generation of cooling airflow is detrimental to engine and aircraft performance. This paper looks at improving the heat removal efficiency of forced convection <b>cooled</b> <b>avionic</b> modules by reducing the thermal resistance between the avionic component and module heat exchanger. The implementation of two-phase high thermal conductivity materials, such as Vapour Chamber Heat Spreaders (VCHS), embedded within the avionic module chassis act to improve heat exchanger isothermalisation, improving the effective heat transfer area. A bespoke test rig has been manufactured to experimentally compare a pure aluminium and embedded VCHS avionic chassis for heat removal capability. When considering a single circuit card, a direct mass flow rate reduction of between 22 % and 65 % is achieved with embedded VCHS over a pure aluminium chassis. Base plate isothermalisation is improved by 9 %, generating a reduction in component temperature of 8 % to 12 %. As the number of heat sources increase, the performance improvements decrease. When testing with three circuit cards mass flow rate savings are reduced to between 14 % and 26 %. The concluding performance characteristic of the embedded VCHS avionic base plate is the insensitivity to the way thermal energy is coupled to it.
