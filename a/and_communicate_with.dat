5|$|This munia eats mainly {{grass seeds}} apart from berries and small insects. They forage in flocks <b>and</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> soft calls and whistles. The species is highly social and may {{sometimes}} roost with {{other species of}} munias. This species is found in tropical plains and grasslands. Breeding pairs construct dome-shaped nests using grass or bamboo leaves.|$|E
5|$|All {{programs}} that wish to provide services-as-files to other programs speak a unified protocol, called 9P. Compared to other systems, this reduces {{the number of}} custom programming interfaces. 9P is a generic, medium-agnostic, byte-oriented protocol that provides for messages delivered between a server and a client. The protocol is {{used to refer to}} <b>and</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> processes, programs, and data, including both the user interface and the network. With the release of the 4th edition, it was modified and renamed 9P2000.|$|E
5|$|Reachs {{multiplayer}} beta {{was open}} to owners of Halo 3: ODST. More than threemillion copies of ODST were sold by November 2009. Bungie estimated between two and three million players for the upcoming Reach beta, compared to the 800,000 that participated in Halo 3s trial. Development schedules forced Bungie to release a six-week-old beta, fraught with bugs and issues already addressed in newer builds. Though concerned that these issues might tarnish the game's image, Jarrard noted that they {{had little choice but}} to ship it as it was <b>and</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> players concerning the fixes.|$|E

5|$|The site is {{only able}} to {{communicate}} with LEO satellites in ten of their fourteen orbits, unlike SvalSat and TrollSat which can communicate in all orbits. All three stations are interconnected <b>and</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> the Tromsø Network Operations Center, {{which is part of the}} TSS complex. This allows for redundancy as TSS, SvalSat and TrollSat can be used to communicate with all satellites connected to the system. The operation center is responsible for backup, scheduling and conflict resolution, in addition to network planning, customer support and ground station control. The facilities use interoperability and shared ground services, such as a common protocol for communication and similar design of the antennas, to increase flexibility and reduce costs and risk.|$|E
5|$|Christy is {{the oldest}} of Carl and Helen Jenkins's two daughters. Both of her parents are mortal, and her powers were {{inherited}} from her maternal grandmother, making her a carrier of the genes determining magical ability. As a witch, Christy possesses the basic ability to cast spells, perform rituals, brew potions, scry for lost people or objects {{through the use of}} a crystal pendant, <b>and</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> the dead. She also possesses an advanced form of telepathy, enabling her to hear and project her thoughts, as well as channeling other magical creatures' powers. Carl and Helen Jenkins (David Starzyk and Barbara Niven) said Christy heard voices prior to her kidnapping, implying that this power was already active. As a firestarter, Christy had the power of pyrokinesis; this power could be augmented by Billie's projection powers to vanquish demons previously believed to be invincible. Christy was identified as the Key to the Ultimate Power due to her relationship with Billie. Demain of Television Without Pity compared Christy to Buffy the Vampire Slayer character Dawn Summers as they were both referenced as the Key.|$|E
5|$|Linois sailed from Toulon on 13 June 1801 {{with three}} ships {{of the line}} and one frigate {{carrying}} 1,560 soldiers under Brigadier-General Devaux. Ganteaume's earlier expedition was still in the Eastern Mediterranean, and so the British blockade force under Sir John Borlase Warren detailed to watch Toulon was instead off Malta hoping to intercept Ganteaume on his return. Therefore, the only British ships on hand when Linois emerged from the port were a few frigates, which were easily chased away by the larger warships of the French squadron. Linois's passage was slow, facing winds from the southwest that delayed his squadron so that by the 30 June they were only off Cape de Gata in the Alboran Sea. On 1 July they were spotted from Gibraltar, although the only warship there was the 14-gun HMS Calpe under Captain George Dundas which was unable to influence their advance. Instead, Captain Dundas ordered Lieutenant Richard Janvarin to take a boat <b>and</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> the Cadiz blockade force of seven ships of the line, under Saumarez.|$|E

5|$|Maggie Faris (Amy Seimetz) is {{the lander}} pilot serving aboard the Covenant and Tennessee's wife. Faris pilots the lander {{carrying}} the excursion team {{down through the}} ionic storm, {{to the surface of}} the planet. While the excursion team makes their way to the crashed Engineer ship, Faris stays with the lander, to calibrate its instruments <b>and</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> Tennessee. She receives communications from Karine Oram that Ledward is ill, prompting her to prepare the medical bay. Upon seeing Ledward's deadly and potentially contagious condition, Faris locks Karine and him in the medical bay, refusing to allow Karine to escape. When the Neomorph emerges and escapes the room, Faris arms herself and attempts to kill it. In the process, she inadvertently damages the lander, causing it to explode. A burning Faris stumbles out of the ship and succumbs to her injuries on the foot ramp.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{encounters}} {{took place}} as the Battle of Hannut was being fought in Belgium. The results were much the same. On the southern face of Bulson, General Friedrich Kirchner, commander of the 1st Panzer Division, suffered several tactical reverses and saw the 37mm shells from his 3.7 cm PaK 36 anti-tank guns and Panzer IIIs bounce off the more heavily armoured French tanks. A number of the German tanks were knocked out in rapid succession. The Germans had to hold the French at the ridge. Kirchner was forced to send in his tanks in dribs and drabs, tactics which Guderian hated, but which he himself decided {{there was no other}} recourse. It was once again the German tanks' radio equipment that enabled them to move around quickly <b>and</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> one another, to change the point of defence or attack quickly. The speed of the German tanks also enabled them to offset their inferiority in combat power to the French tanks. Often, the Panzer III and IVs could speed into the rear of French formations, closing quickly and knocking out the French armour from the rear. The Germans noted the particular weakness between the chassis and turret of the French tanks, which were vulnerable to their fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{remainder}} of the game takes place in 1995. Bond visits Monte Carlo to investigate the frigate La Fayette, where he rescues several hostages and plants a tracker bug on the Eurocopter Tiger helicopter before it is stolen by the Janus crime syndicate. Bond is then sent a second time to Severnaya, but during the mission he is captured and locked up in the bunker's cells along with Natalya Simonova, who has been betrayed to Janus. The two escape the complex seconds before it is destroyed, on the orders of Ourumov, by the GoldenEye satellite's EMP. Bond next travels to Saint Petersburg, where he arranges with ex-KGB agent Valentin Zukovsky to meet {{the chief of the}} Janus organisation. This is revealed to be Alec Trevelyan – his execution by Ourumov in the Arkhangelsk facility was faked. Bond and Natalya escape from Trevelyan, but are arrested by the Russian police and taken to the military archives for interrogation. Bond eventually manages to escape the interrogation room, rescue Natalya, <b>and</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin, who has verified Bond's claim of Ourumov's treachery. Natalya is recaptured by General Ourumov, and Bond gives chase through the streets of St. Petersburg, eventually reaching an arms depot used by Janus. There Bond destroys its weaponry stores and then hitches a ride on Trevelyan's ex-Soviet missile train, where he kills Ourumov and rescues Natalya. However, Alec Trevelyan and his ally Xenia Onatopp escape to their secret base in Cuba.|$|E
