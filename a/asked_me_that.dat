2500|$|However, in 2009 Bret Hart {{stated in}} an {{interview}} with Sky Sports that he will forgive Michaels, if Shawn apologizes first, saying [...] "For me I don't really have much issue with it anymore. If you <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> up until probably about a year ago I'd have probably said something different. But I've cooled off a bit now. I don't want to carry it around anymore. If he wanted to apologize I would accept it. I'd move on but I wouldn't forget it." [...] He also put over the Michaels-Undertaker match at WrestleMania XXV, saying he was proud of both men's efforts and that despite his personal feelings towards Michaels, he always had the utmost respect for his abilities. Similarly, Michaels has commended Hart's abilities, calling him a [...] "sheer joy" [...] to work with in the ring.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after his}} capture, Oswald {{encountered}} reporters in a hallway. Oswald declared, [...] "I didn't shoot anybody" [...] and, [...] "They've taken me in {{because of the}} fact that I lived in the Soviet Union. I'm just a patsy!" [...] Later, at an arranged press meeting, a reporter asked, [...] "Did you kill the President?" [...] and Oswald—who by that time had been advised of the charge of murdering Tippit, but had not yet been arraigned in Kennedy's death—answered, [...] "No, I have not been charged with that. In fact, nobody has said that to me yet. The first thing I heard about it was when the newspaper reporters in the hall <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> question." [...] As he was led from the room the question was called out, [...] "What did you do in Russia?" [...] and, [...] "How did you hurt your eye?"; Oswald answered, [...] "A policeman hit me." ...|$|E
60|$|My uncle <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{question}} as we alighted from the train.|$|E
60|$|Don't <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> Violet. You know I {{love you}} {{with all my}} heart.|$|R
60|$|COKESON. Your lordship mustn't <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> or I {{shall have}} to tell you what I was told--and that'd never do.|$|R
60|$|Aca. Why {{should you}} <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that?</b> Those must be mine, though I have such excess; Divided griefs increase, and not grow less.|$|R
6000|$|... "O, {{just the}} same, Mr. Michael, {{just the way}} he'll be till the end, worthy man!" [...] was the reply. [...] "But ye'll {{not be the first}} that's <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{your mother}} had <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> question," [...] she {{retorted}} with spirit, [...] "I {{should have told}} her that he was the man who got me safely out of the theatre after you...." [...] She checked herself. She did not want to say the unforgivable thing. [...] "You see," [...] she said more quietly, [...] "you had disappeared...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Had you <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{question}} {{a short time}} since," [...] replied Hollingsworth, after a pause, during which, it seemed to me, even the birch-trees held their whispering breath, [...] "I should have told you--'No!' My feelings for Priscilla differed little from those of an elder brother, watching tenderly over the gentle sister whom God has given him to protect." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jimmy Skunk {{shrugged his}} shoulders. [...] "Don't <b>ask</b> <b>me.</b> <b>That</b> {{is one of}} Old Mother Nature's secrets; you'll have to ask her," [...] he replied.|$|R
6000|$|... "About--er--two years," [...] stammered Job Haskers. He looked keenly at Mr. Fordham {{and then}} at Mr. Passmore. [...] "What--er--why do you <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> question?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What," [...] exclaimed Mr. Flint, [...] "you <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> question? You, my own daughter, {{about people}} who are trying to make me out a rascal!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you had <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{question}} this morning, Vincent," [...] replied Mrs. Agnes Parsons Jopp, [...] "I {{should have been}} obliged to say that I felt far from well. I had an odd throbbing feeling in the left elbow, and I am sure my temperature was above the normal. But this afternoon I am a little better. How are you, Vincent?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you had <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{question}} {{two years}} ago--even a year ago--I {{should have given}} you a different answer. It's taken me some time to learn it, too, you see, and I'm not a man. I once thought I should {{have liked to have}} been a king amongst money changers, and own railroad and steamship lines, and dominate men by sheer power." ...|$|E
6000|$|This lady, however, {{regarded}} it very placidly. [...] "I shouldn't {{have gone}} if she HAD <b>asked</b> <b>me.</b> <b>That</b> is I think I shouldn't; and I'm glad I hadn't {{to make up}} my mind. It {{would have been a}} very difficult question. I shouldn't have liked to turn away from her, and yet I shouldn't have been happy under her roof. A pension will suit me very well. But that's not all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why didn't you <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{at first}} simply, without {{speaking}} of the girl?" [...] said Osmond. [...] "You could have had her there at any rate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But, my dear Dorothy,' Mr. Singleton said, 'why {{on earth}} do you <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> question? Surely you cannot wish me to mention {{anything}} about that trifling affair.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{that was}} a more daring shot, though I {{have no doubt that}} I was right. You must not <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> at the present state of the affair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{entered a}} certain drawing-room {{about a week}} ago," [...] I said. [...] "'We were just {{speaking}} about you,' exclaimed my hostess. 'Is not this yours?' She pointed to an article in a certain magazine lying open on the table. 'No,' I replied; 'one or two people have <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> same question. It seems to me rather an absurd article,' I added. 'I cannot say I thought very much of it,' agreed my hostess." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I {{could tell}} you almost {{anything}} if you <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> way, my boy. It isn't that I am too proud,--and you're right about my sometimes wanting to free my mind,--but it's because a man of forty don't just like to open out to young fellows, {{if there is any}} danger of their laughing at him, though he may deserve it. I guess there isn't now, and I'll tell you how I found my wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] he said, [...] "if you had <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{question}} a month ago, Mr. Haviland, I might have replied to you differently. Circumstances, however, since then have changed. My departure {{will take place}} so soon, and the kindness I have met here from all of you has been so overwhelming, that if you will let me I should like to speak of certain things concerning which no written communication could ever pass between our two countries." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me--that it isn't all true," [...] she begged. [...] "Tell <b>me</b> <b>that</b> your {{kindness}} to me, at least, was real--that you did {{not mean}} it to be for my unhappiness afterwards. Please tell <b>me</b> <b>that.</b> I think if you <b>asked</b> <b>me,</b> if you cared to <b>ask</b> <b>me,</b> <b>that</b> I could forgive everything else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{think you}} <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> only {{to change the}} subject,' he said. 'I don't believe that ever in your life you have been {{unconscious}} {{of what you have}} done with your keys.' ...|$|R
60|$|Doctor Crocus {{makes no}} verbal answer, but {{gives me an}} imploring look, which says so plainly 'Will you <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> again, a little louder, if you please?' that I repeat the question.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Red Jacket grunted. [...] "Yes," [...] he says. [...] "He <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> too. If he {{had been}} a small chief I should have lied. But he is a great chief. He knew I was a chief, so I told him the truth. I told him what Big Hand said to Cornplanter and me in the clearing--'There will be no war.' I could not see what he thought. I could not see behind his face. But he is a great chief. He will believe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I {{was really}} to blame from the {{beginning}} to the end. If it had not been for my pitiful wish to shine as the confidant of mystery, nothing would have been known of the affair. Even when you <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> night if it had not happened at St. Johnswort, I know now that I had a wretched triumph in saying that it had, and I was so full of this that I did not think to caution you against repeating what I had owned." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] he said, [...] "it is as {{well that}} you should have <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> question. I have always been an indulgent father, as I think you will find me an indulgent uncle. But there are certain things, certain {{offences}} I might say, for which I have no forgiveness. Stella deceived me. She made use of information, secret information which she acquired in this room, to benefit some man in whom she was interested. She used my secrets to enrich this person. She did this after I had warned her. I never warn twice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You surely do {{not need}} to <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> question," [...] Tavernake answered, fervently. [...] "I should believe your word, {{whatever}} you told me. I should not believe that you could do anything wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no, {{he did not}} <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that.</b> He <b>asked</b> {{of little}} things that {{happened}} at the time; but from his manner I am sure he knows it all. He says--that I shall escape." ...|$|R
60|$|AUGUSTA. You <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that?</b> I {{try hard}} to give you credit, Jonathan, for not knowing {{the ways of the}} world--but it's always been {{difficult}} to believe that Minnie Farrell had become well--a bad woman.|$|R
6000|$|Then Belle Isoult {{began to}} pant with great agitation, and {{by and by}} she said, [...] "Lord, why ask you me that?" [...] King Arthur said: [...] "Because, lady, I think your heart hath {{sometimes}} asked you the selfsame question." [...] Then the Lady Belle Isoult clasped her hands together and cried out: [...] "Yea, yea, my heart hath often <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> question, but I would not answer it." [...] King Arthur said: [...] "Neither shalt thou answer me, for I am but a weak and erring man as thou art a woman. But answer thou that question to God, dear lady, and then thou shalt answer it in truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Jack was there," [...] said Jenny, without {{change of}} color, or the least self-consciousness in her great gray eyes; [...] "and {{he came home}} with me." [...] She paused a moment, locking her two hands under her head, and {{assuming}} a more comfortable position on the pillow. [...] "He <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> same question again, father, and I said, 'Yes.' It's to be--soon. We're going to live at Four Forks, in his own house; and next winter we're going to Sacramento. I suppose it's all right, father, eh?" [...] She emphasized the question with a slight kick through the bed-clothes, as the parental McClosky had fallen into an abstract revery.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your father once <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> same {{question}} in the galleries of the Golden Cliffs within the Otz Mountains, beneath the temples of the therns. I could not answer him, nor can I answer you. I do not know whence comes my power over them, but ever since the day that Sator Throg threw me among them in the banth pit of the Holy Therns, and the great creatures fawned upon instead of devouring me, I ever {{have had the same}} strange power over them. They come at my call and do my bidding, even as the faithful Woola does the bidding of your mighty sire." ...|$|E
5000|$|On his {{retirement}} as an Alderman in 1966 Bauler was {{asked how he}} stayed in office so long, he replied [...] "There ain't a thing they <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I don't try to do," [...] " ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! Madame," [...] he said, [...] "there {{have been}} so many people lately who have been <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> question, yet to you as to them I must return the same answer. She is my niece!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Una," [...] she {{answered}} very gravely, {{in a low}} strange tone, [...] "oh, don't <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> about <b>that,</b> dear. Don't <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> about <b>that.</b> You could never understand it.... I got them... in climbing over a high stone wall... a high stone wall, with bits of glass stuck on top of it." ...|$|R
