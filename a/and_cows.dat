5|$|About 78% of {{the land}} surface of Wales is given over to {{agricultural}} use.), Wales area 20,779 km2 However, very little of this is arable land; the vast majority consists of permanent grass pasture or rough grazing for herd animals such as sheep <b>and</b> <b>cows.</b> Although both beef and dairy cattle are raised widely, especially in Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire, Wales is more well known for its sheep farming and thus lamb is the meat traditionally associated with Welsh cooking.|$|E
5|$|Mature bulls {{can weigh}} up to 800 {{kilograms}} (1,800pounds) <b>and</b> <b>cows</b> can weigh up to 500 kilograms (1,100pounds). Cows typically have {{a height of}} 90–106centimeters (3–3.5ft), and bulls are typically {{in the range of}} 106–120centimeters (3.5–4ft). Mating occurs throughout the year with a gestation period of approximately 277–290 days. Most commonly a single calf is born, but twins are not unknown. Sexual maturity is reached at about eighteen months. Highland cattle also have a longer expected lifespan than most other breeds of cattle, up to 20 years.|$|E
5|$|They are a {{hardy breed}} {{due to their}} native environment, the Highlands of Scotland. This results in long hair, giving the breed its ability to overwinter. Bulls can weigh up to 800kilograms (1,800 pounds) <b>and</b> <b>cows</b> up to 500kilograms (1,100 pounds). Their milk {{generally}} has a very high butterfat content, and their meat, regarded as of the highest quality, is gaining mainstream acceptance as it is lower in cholesterol than other varieties of beef.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT FACTORS INFLUENCING <b>COW</b> PERFORMANCE <b>AND</b> INTAKE Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to determine how weaning system, residual feed intake (RFI), and residual average daily gain (RADG) affect <b>cow</b> performance <b>and</b> intake. In Study 1, a two-year study was conducted using Angus and Simmental X Angus heifers (n= 114) to evaluate how weaning system (early weaning (EW) vs. normal weaning (NW)) affects cow-calf performance <b>and</b> intake. All <b>cows</b> with male calves were early weaned at 130 d while cows with female calves were normal weaned at 200 d. These animals were then evaluated for individual intake at 60 d, 120 d, 180 d, and 240 d postpartum. Weigh-suckle-weigh (WSW) {{was used to determine}} milk production for the lactating periods. BW, Hip height, body condition score (BCS, 1 - 9 scale), and backfat via ultrasound were measured. No differences (P > 0. 05) were noted in the 60 and 120 d postpartum cow measurements, but calf BW did differ (P 0. 05) in DMI or overall pregnancy rate. Early weaning can improve <b>cow</b> condition <b>and</b> decrease intake, allowing for increased stocking rates. In Study 2, a two-year study was conducted using Angus and Simmental X Angus heifers (n= 114) to determine their residual feed intake (RFI) and residual average daily gain (RADG) as yearlings using the GrowSafe® system. These animals were then evaluated for individual intake at 60 d postpartum (lactating period) and 240 d postpartum (dry period). The same measurements were taken as in Study 1. For the lactating period, correlations were: heifer DMI <b>and</b> <b>cow</b> DMI (0. 35), heifer RFI <b>and</b> <b>cow</b> DMI (0. 20), heifer RFI <b>and</b> <b>cow</b> BW (- 0. 08), iii heifer RFI <b>and</b> <b>cow</b> hip height (0. 02), heifer RFI and milk production (- 0. 09), heifer RADG <b>and</b> <b>cow</b> DMI (- 0. 06), heifer RADG <b>and</b> <b>cow</b> BW (0. 21), heifer RADG <b>and</b> <b>cow</b> hip height (0. 25), and heifer RADG and milk production (0. 03). For the dry period correlations were: heifer DMI <b>and</b> <b>cow</b> DMI (0. 06), heifer RFI <b>and</b> <b>cow</b> DMI (0. 29), heifer RFI <b>and</b> <b>cow</b> BW (0. 00), heifer RFI <b>and</b> <b>cow</b> hip height (- 0. 09), heifer RADG <b>and</b> <b>cow</b> DMI (- 0. 10), heifer RADG <b>and</b> <b>cow</b> BW (0. 23), and heifer RADG <b>and</b> <b>cow</b> hip height (0. 31). Heifer RFI is correlated with <b>cow</b> intake <b>and</b> thus can be used to help predict intake and efficiency without effecting performance...|$|R

5|$|Driessen explores ways {{in which}} nonhuman animals might be {{understood}} to be engaging in political deliberation. His claim is empirical rather than normative, as he presents nonhuman animals as already being in political dialogue with humans; rather than arguing that rights should be extended to animals, he calls for a recognition of how interactions with animals have always been political. This is particularly noticeable, he argues, when humans {{are involved in the}} development of new technologies, analysing the example (following Bruno Latour) of Gaston Lagaffe building a door in dialogue with his boss and the office cat, and of farmers <b>and</b> <b>cows</b> using milking robots. He argues that a recognition of this animal deliberation can lead to more thoughtful forms of both environmentalism and democracy.|$|E

25|$|Swiss doctor Paul Niehans, {{who was one}} of {{the fathers}} of {{cellular}} therapy, developed in 1931–1949 years the so-called Fresh cell therapy. Fresh cell therapy is mainly the use of live animal embryo organs cells which are injected into the patient with the purpose of achieving a revitalizing effect. These cells are generally extracted from sheep’s fetuses because in comparison to other animals, like pigs, rabbits <b>and</b> <b>cows,</b> sheep are clean animals and rarely contact diseases. Of course animal cells are not able to be included in human tissue, but they can secrete factors for rejuvenating. That's why this rejuvenation technology, despite the harsh criticism is practiced to this day.|$|E
25|$|In 1876 William Brown, a {{professor}} of agriculture and then superintendent of the experimental farm at Guelph, Ontario, was granted permission {{by the government of}} Ontario to purchase Aberdeen Angus cattle for the Ontario Agricultural College. The herd comprised a yearling bull, Gladiolus, and a cow, Eyebright, bred by the Earl of Fife and a cow, Leochel Lass 4th, bred by R.O. Farquharson. On January 12, 1877, Eyebright gave birth to a calf, sired by Sir Wilfrid. It was the first to be born outside of Scotland. The OAC went on to import additional bulls <b>and</b> <b>cows,</b> eventually began selling Aberdeen Angus cattle in 1881.|$|E

25|$|Organism cloning (also called {{reproductive}} cloning) {{refers to}} the procedure of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another. In essence this form of cloning is an asexual method of reproduction, where fertilization or inter-gamete contact does not take place. Asexual reproduction is a naturally occurring phenomenon in many species, including most plants (see vegetative reproduction) and some insects. Scientists have made some major achievements with cloning, including the asexual reproduction of sheep <b>and</b> <b>cows.</b> There {{is a lot of}} ethical debate over whether or not cloning should be used. However, cloning, or asexual propagation, has been common practice in the horticultural world for hundreds of years.|$|E
25|$|Kelley's most {{elaborate}} crossover was only partially successful. He sought to crossover {{an episode of}} his Picket Fences with Chris Carter's The X-Files. Both shows aired Friday nights, but on different networks. The intent was to begin the story on one show, then hope viewers would switch channels to watch the conclusion on another network. CBS balked, and both scripts were rewritten, with The X-Files Fox Mulder no longer set to appear on Picket Fences. Yet, both episodes deal with Wisconsin <b>and</b> <b>cows,</b> with Fences referencing an FBI investigation in a neighboring town. CBS blurred the connection further by postponing the Fences episode by one week.|$|E
25|$|Toirdelbach was {{the chief}} {{beneficiary}} of Diarmait's death, the Annals of Innisfallen recording that:Toirdelbach Ua Briain went to Osraige and Leinster, burned Uí Cheinnselaig and brought away much booty <b>and</b> <b>cows,</b> and took hostages from {{it as well as}} from Leinster. And the foreigners gave him the kingship of Dublin, and he made prisoner the sons of Domnall, son of Máel na mBó, in Dublin, and brought back the hostages of Osraige on that occasion. Conchobar Ua Máel Shechnaill, king of Mide, was murdered the next year, and Toirdelbach took advantage of this to ravage the midlands, followed by an expedition to Connacht where he obtained hostages from both the Uí Conchobair and the Uí Ruairc. He divided Leinster between various rivals, a policy of divide and rule which would serve him well. In Dublin he installed one Gofraid mac Amlaíb meic Ragnaill, perhaps a kinsman of Echmarcach, as his client king.|$|E

25|$|Consumption, phthisis, scrofula, Pott's disease, and the White Plague are all terms used {{to refer}} to {{tuberculosis}} throughout history. It is generally accepted that Mycobacterium tuberculosis originated from other, more primitive organisms of the same genus Mycobacterium. In 2014, results of a new DNA study of a tuberculosis genome reconstructed from remains in southern Peru suggest that human tuberculosis is less than 6,000 years old. Even if researchers theorize that humans first acquired it in Africa about 5,000 years ago, {{there is no evidence that}} the first tuberculosis infection happened about 9,000 years ago. It spread to other humans along trade routes. It also spread to domesticated animals in Africa, such as goats <b>and</b> <b>cows.</b> Seals and sea lions that bred on African beaches are believed to have acquired the disease and carried it across the Atlantic to South America. Hunters would have been the first humans to contract the disease there.|$|E
25|$|In 1880, Pasteur's rival Jean-Joseph-Henri Toussaint, a {{veterinary}} surgeon, used {{carbolic acid}} to kill anthrax bacilli and tested the vaccine on sheep. Pasteur {{thought that this}} type of killed vaccine should not work because he believed that attenuated bacteria used up nutrients that the bacteria needed to grow. He thought oxidizing bacteria made them less virulent. In early 1881, Pasteur discovered that growing anthrax bacilli at about 42 °C made them unable to produce spores, and he described this method {{in a speech to the}} French Academy of Sciences on February 28. Later in 1881, veterinarian Hippolyte Rossignol proposed that the Société d'agriculture de Melun organize an experiment to test Pasteur's vaccine. Pasteur agreed, and the experiment, conducted at Pouilly-le-Fort on sheep, goats <b>and</b> <b>cows,</b> was successful. Pasteur did not directly disclose how he prepared the vaccines used at Pouilly-le-Fort. His laboratory notebooks, now in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, show that he actually used heat and potassium dichromate, similar to Toussaint's method.|$|E
25|$|Prey pathway animals include sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama and alpaca. The right {{conditions}} for the domestication {{for some of them}} appear to have been in place in the central and eastern Fertile Crescent {{at the end of the}} Younger Dryas climatic downturn and the beginning of the Early Holocene about 11,700 YBP, and by 10,000 YBP people were preferentially killing young males of a variety of species and allowed the females to live in order to produce more offspring. By measuring the size, sex ratios, and mortality profiles of zooarchaeological specimens, archeologists have been able to document changes in the management strategies of hunted sheep, goats, pigs, <b>and</b> <b>cows</b> in the Fertile Crescent starting 11,700 YBP. A recent demographic and metrical study of cow and pig remains at Sha’ar Hagolan, Israel, demonstrated that both species were severely overhunted before domestication, suggesting that the intensive exploitation led to management strategies adopted throughout the region that ultimately led to the domestication of these populations following the prey pathway. This pattern of overhunting before domestication suggests that the prey pathway was as accidental and unintentional as the commensal pathway.|$|E
