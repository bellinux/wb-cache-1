25|$|This {{brings us}} back to Wittgenstein's {{reliance}} on indirect communication, and his reliance on thought-experiments. Some philosophical confusions come about because we aren't able to see family resemblances. We've made a mistake in understanding the vague and intuitive rules that language uses, and have thereby tied ourselves up in philosophical knots. He suggests that an attempt to untangle these knots requires more than simple deductive arguments pointing out the problems with some particular position. Instead, Wittgenstein's larger goal is to try to divert us from our philosophical problems long enough to become <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> intuitive ability to see the family resemblances.|$|E

In a 2012 interview on Bookyurt, Westerfeld explained that his point in writing the book was not to make a big commentary on the issues with beauty, but to make people aware of the culture of retouching that is developing in the world and to be <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> own ideas about beauty and our need to think for ourselves.|$|E

We show wagering is no more sensitive to conscious knowledge than simple verbal confidence reports but is affected by risk aversion.

We show that when people are just as ready to bet on a genuine random process as their own classification decisions, their classifications are still above baseline, indicating knowledge participants are not <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> having. <b>Our</b> results have methodological implications for any study investigating whether people are <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> knowing...|$|R

However, before he could be selected for any Scotland matches, it was revealed that due to an agreement made between the Home Nations in 1993, Johnson would not be eligible to play for any Home Nation other than England, as his mother is from Birmingham. Although Johnson met the terms required by FIFA to play internationally for Scotland, he did not meet the terms of the agreement set out in 1993.

In Nausea, the main character's feeling of dizziness towards his own existence is induced by things, not thinking. This dizziness occurs [...] "in the face of one's freedom and responsibility for giving a meaning to reality". As an important break with Descartes, Sartre rejects the primacy of knowledge, as summed up in the phrase [...] "Existence precedes essence", and offers a different conception of knowledge and consciousness.|$|R

[...] William James popularized this {{use of the term}} [...] "religious experience" [...] in his The Varieties of Religious Experience, contributing to the interpretation of mysticism as a distinctive experience, comparable to sensory experiences. Religious experiences belonged to the [...] "personal religion," [...] which he considered to be [...] "more fundamental than either theology or ecclesiasticism". He gave a Perennialist interpretation to religious experience, stating that this kind of experience is ultimately uniform in various traditions.|$|E
2500|$|One of his {{favorite}} metaphors was about transformative possibilities.

[...] Similarly, he as a [...] "painter ought to paint pictures; possibly something else will come after that." [...] Of prostitutes, such as those he met at brothels, Van Gogh wondered of any woman who fell into a life of degradation: [...] "She is seeking, seeking, seeking -- does she herself know what? [...] Might she be transformed one day like a grub into a butterfly?" [...] That hope may have been on Van Gogh's mind when he took in pregnant Sien Hoornik, a prostitute, and her daughter when he lived in The Hague in 1882.|$|E
2500|$|Donald like Plato (and Aristotle, {{especially}} in On Memory and Recollection), emphasizes the peculiarity in humans of voluntary initiation of a search through one's mental world. The ancient Greek anamnēsis, normally translated as [...] "recollection" [...] {{was opposed to}} mneme or memory. Memory, shared with some animals, requires a consciousness not only {{of what happened in}} the past, but also that something happened in the past, which is in other words a kind of eikasia [...] "...but nothing except man is able to recollect." [...] Recollection is a deliberate effort to search for and recapture something once known. Klein writes that, [...] "To become <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> having forgotten something means to begin recollecting." [...] Donald calls the same thing autocueing, which he explains as follows: [...] "Mimetic acts are reproducible on the basis of internal, self-generated cues. This permits voluntary recall of mimetic representations, without the aid of external cues – probably the earliest form of representational thinking." ...|$|E

In September that year they issued their next album, Horse Stories, which was voted by Rolling Stone magazine {{as one of the}} topthree albums of the year. In March 1998 the band issued Ocean Songs, which Billboards Chris Morris felt was [...] "an unexpected new direction" [...] where [...] "the sound is still brazenly live, the atmosphere is generally rapturous and lyrical, instead of explosive and febrile". The album peaked in the top50 on the ARIA Albums Chart. In October 2010 Ocean Songs was listed in the book 100 Best Australian Albums. It was described as displaying [...] "an Australian sound that had never been heard before, one that was <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> vast landscape but was reared in the urban landscapes of our various inner-city underground scenes".

2500|$|For Kierkegaard, true {{individuality}} {{is called}} selfhood. Becoming <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> true self is our true task and endeavor in life—it is an ethical imperative, {{as well as}} preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist {{at a level that}} is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our pleasures—our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in Either/Or, Here, then, I have your view of life, and, believe me, much of your life will become clear to you if you will consider it along with me as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, because {{if there is to be}} meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little teleology as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, you stick your hands in your pocket and contemplate life. Now you rest in despair. Nothing concerns you; you step aside for nothing; “If someone threw a roof tile down I would still not step aside.” You are like a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you “Always count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.” You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. But then something suddenly comes along that grips you, an idea, a situation, a young girl’s smile, and now you are “involved,” for just on certain occasions you are not “involved,” so at other times you are “at your service” in every way. Wherever there is something going on you join in. You behave in life as you usually do in a crowd. “You work yourself into the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so that you come to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you let yourself be carried through life.” But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand on the street corner and look at the world.

40|$|We study racial/ethnic {{disparities in}} {{awareness}} of chronic diseases using biomarker {{data from the}} 2006 HRS. We explore two alternative definitions of awareness, and estimate a 3 -step sequential model which accounts for selection along measured and unmeasured factors into: (1) participating in biomarker collection, (2) having illness (hypertension or diabetes), and (3) being <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> illness. <b>Our</b> findings suggest that current estimates of racial/ethnic disparities in chronic disease are sensitive to selection, and also {{to the definition of}} disease awareness that is used. Contrary to prior studies reporting that African-Americans are more <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> having hypertension than non-Latino whites, we do not find this conclusion to be true after self-selection and severity are considered. Likewise, prior studies show mixed evidence of racial/ethnic disparities in awareness of diabetes, but after accounting for selection, we find that African- Americans and Latinos are less <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> having diabetes compared to non-Latino whites. These findings are based on a widely used definition of awareness – the likelihood of self-reporting disease among those who have disease. When we use an alternative definition of awareness, which considers an individual to be unaware if s/he actually has the disease but self-reports not having it, we find striking racial/ethnic disparities in awareness. ...|$|R
