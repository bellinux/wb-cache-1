5|$|Aagadu was {{released}} on 19 September 2014 in 2000 screens <b>across</b> the globe. Eros International acquired the film's global distribution rights. The film {{was released}} in 150 screens <b>across</b> the United States, a record number for a Telugu film. Owing to Mahesh's popularity there, the makers offered to screen Aagadu in every university there and in other countries, if {{there are more than}} 100 students willing to watch the film. Efforts were made to release the film <b>across</b> the United States with subtitles.|$|E
5|$|<b>Across</b> North America during La Niña, {{increased}} precipitation is diverted {{into the}} Pacific Northwest {{due to a}} more northerly storm track and jet stream. The storm track shifts far enough northward to bring wetter than normal conditions (in the form of increased snowfall) to the Midwestern states, as well as hot and dry summers. Snowfall is above normal <b>across</b> the Pacific Northwest and western Great Lakes. <b>Across</b> the North Atlantic, the jet stream is stronger than normal, which directs stronger systems with increased precipitation towards Europe.|$|E
5|$|<b>Across</b> Southwestern Mexico, Hurricane Dolores {{produced}} {{heavy rains}} that triggered widespread flooding and mudslides. Numerous roads sustained damage, separating communities from surrounding areas. At least 18 {{people were killed}} and 32 others were injured by the storm. Additionally, an estimated 173,000 people were affected <b>across</b> the country.|$|E
5|$|All three spans <b>across</b> the Ottawa River East Channel are twinned {{by another}} span, built simultaneously, <b>across</b> the West Channel.|$|E
5|$|An area of low {{pressure}} tracked <b>across</b> southeastern Canada during the 12th, which brought an arctic front <b>across</b> the Mid Atlantic region {{late on the}} 12th. As this occurred, a strong area of high pressure located <b>across</b> central Canada built down into the Northeast, allowing very cold air to spill southward ultimately leading to what is known as cold air damming. This occurs east of the mountains down through the Mid Atlantic states. Meanwhile, a Pacific storm slammed onto the California coast during the 11th and as it moved eastward, a new area of {{low pressure}} developed <b>across</b> southeastern Colorado and the Texas Panhandle.|$|E
5|$|As {{measured}} between 10:00am and 5:00pmEST, U.S.television viewership for the Obama inaugural events achieved {{an average}} of 37.8million <b>across</b> 17broadcast and cable channels, not including online viewers who watched live streaming video of the events. Although the Obama inaugural events achieved an average U.S.television viewership of 37.8million <b>across</b> both broadcast networks and cable channels, viewership for the events was lower than the U.S.television viewership for the 1981 Reagan inaugural festivities, which averaged 41.8million <b>across</b> the ABC, CBS and NBC broadcast networks alone.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} system moved eastward toward the Ohio, Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys on April 27, a very {{powerful}} 80–100 knot mid-level jet stream moved into the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, behind the trough, creating strong wind shear, with a low pressure center moving quickly northeastward <b>across</b> those areas on the 27th. On the afternoon of April 27, CAPE values were estimated {{to be in the}} range of 2000–3000 J/kg <b>across</b> Louisiana and southern Mississippi, with the moderate instability moving northeastward <b>across</b> the southern Tennessee Valley; in addition, temperatures <b>across</b> the southeastern United States ranged from the 70s°F (mid-20s°C) to the lower 90s°F (near 35°C). Helicity levels ranged from 450–600 m2/s2, which were supportive for significant tornadic activity and strong to violent long-track tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Barry dropped {{moderate}} to heavy rainfall <b>across</b> Florida, peaking at 6.99inches (178mm) at Palm Beach International Airport; several other locations reported over 3inches (75mm). The rainfall alleviated persistent drought conditions and assisted in combating severe wildfires <b>across</b> the state. In Brevard County, the rainfall closed {{a portion of}} Eau Gallie Boulevard after a large sinkhole developed. Several other roads <b>across</b> the area were flooded, and on Interstate 95 near Lake Worth, a sinkhole closed two lanes of traffic. Wet roads caused several traffic accidents <b>across</b> the state; in both Brevard and Volusia counties, a motorist was killed from an accident. On Interstate 4, a tractor trailer led to disruptions near Orlando after it crashed into a guardrail.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the early}} Netherlandish period, divine light {{was not well}} described: if a painter wanted to depict heavenly radiance, he {{typically}} painted an object in reflective gold. There was a focus on describing the object itself rather than {{the effect of the}} light as it fell <b>across</b> it. Van Eyck {{was one of the first}} to portray light's saturation, illuminating effects and gradations as it poured <b>across</b> the pictorial space. He detailed how an object's colour could vary depending on the amount and type of light illuminating it. This play of light is evident <b>across</b> the panel, and especially seen on Mary's gilded dress and jewelled crown, <b>across</b> her hair and on her mantle.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have been}} seen as symbols, and used as such, though {{perceptions}} of bird species vary widely <b>across</b> cultures: some birds have a positive image in some regions, a negative image in others. Owls are associated with bad luck, witchcraft, and death in parts of Africa, but are regarded as wise <b>across</b> much of Europe. Hoopoes were considered sacred in Ancient Egypt and symbols of virtue in Persia, but were thought of as thieves <b>across</b> much of Europe, and harbingers of war in Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|Early June, 1982- Hurricane Alberto stalls {{over the}} eastern Gulf of Mexico, though its outer bands produce {{moderate}} rainfall <b>across</b> the state, peaking at 16.47inches (418mm) in Tavernier. The hurricane produces tornadic activity <b>across</b> the state, and the storm results in generally minor damage.|$|E
5|$|Easterly winds, on average, {{dominate}} the flow pattern <b>across</b> the poles, westerly winds blow <b>across</b> the mid-latitudes of the earth, polewards of the subtropical ridge, while easterlies again {{dominate the}} tropics.|$|E
5|$|Financial {{incentives}} for photovoltaics differ <b>across</b> countries, including Australia, China, Germany, Israel, Japan, and the United States and even <b>across</b> states within the US.|$|E
5|$|France officially {{adopted the}} metric system on 10 December 1799. Although it was decreed that its use {{was to be}} {{mandatory}} in Paris that year and <b>across</b> the provinces the following year, the decree was not universally observed <b>across</b> France.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Audrey {{directed}} moisture up to a {{front to}} its north <b>across</b> the Midwest during late June 1957 as it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Heavy rains fell <b>across</b> central Illinois, {{leading to the}} wettest known event {{to be associated with}} a tropical cyclone or its remains <b>across</b> Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kyle was the {{eleventh}} tropical storm and sixth hurricane of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed from a strong tropical disturbance that tracked <b>across</b> the northeastern Caribbean Sea {{in the third}} week of September. As a low pressure area, it moved slowly <b>across</b> Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, dumping torrential rains <b>across</b> those islands.|$|E
5|$|If it {{had gone}} by me, it's a two-on-one. So I got a little lucky there, but Derek gave me a great pass and when I got the pass I was moving <b>across.</b> As I skated <b>across,</b> Glenn had to move <b>across</b> the crease and had to open his pads a little. I was really {{trying to get the}} puck on net, and I did. As I went <b>across,</b> Glenn's legs opened. I looked back, and I saw it go in, so I jumped.|$|E
5|$|Indians {{are very}} {{integrated}} <b>across</b> tribal boundaries, intermarrying <b>across</b> tribes and sharing child {{and medical care}} services <b>across</b> tribes. Lara {{was an example of}} this; he married a Spirit Lake Sioux woman and moved to that reservation before his exclusion by the tribe.|$|E
5|$|May 28, 1972– Subtropical Storm Alpha makes {{landfall}} near Brunswick, Georgia {{and turns}} southwestward <b>across</b> northern Florida, dropping light rainfall <b>across</b> its path but causing no damage.|$|E
5|$|Notable German burials include Musketier Oskar Niemeyer {{from the}} 84th Infantry Regiment {{was the first}} {{recipient}} of the Iron Cross during the war. Having come to a crossing of the Mons–Condé canal with a closed swing bridge he swam <b>across</b> the canal, returned <b>across</b> the canal with a requisitioned small boat, paddled back <b>across</b> the canal with a team and then opened the bridge allowing the Germans troops to cross in greater numbers. He was killed shortly after opening the bridge.|$|E
5|$|October 5, 1995– Former Hurricane Opal {{produces}} moderate rainfall <b>across</b> and gusty winds <b>across</b> {{much of the}} state; {{a falling}} tree, {{as a result of}} the winds, kills a man when it strikes a mobile home, and also causes one indirect death. Damage amounts to over $15million.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of October 16, more allied guns were in line and the fire intensified. In desperation, Cornwallis {{attempted}} to evacuate his troops <b>across</b> the York River to Gloucester Point. At Gloucester Point the troops {{might be able to}} break through the allied lines and escape into Virginia and then march to New York. One wave of boats made it <b>across</b> but a squall hit when they returned to take more soldiers <b>across,</b> making the evacuation impossible.|$|E
5|$|Perceptions of {{bird species}} vary <b>across</b> cultures. Owls are {{associated}} with bad luck, witchcraft, and death in parts of Africa, but are regarded as wise <b>across</b> much of Europe. Hoopoes were considered sacred in Ancient Egypt and symbols of virtue in Persia, but were thought of as thieves <b>across</b> much of Europe and harbingers of war in Scandinavia. In heraldry, birds, especially eagles, often appear in coats of arms.|$|E
5|$|September 26, 2002– Tropical Storm Isidore hits {{southern}} Louisiana, {{though its}} large circulation drops rainfall <b>across</b> the state peaking at 9.1inches (231mm) in Pensacola. Tornadoes spawned {{by the storm}} damage multiple mobile homes, with monetary damage <b>across</b> the state totaling over $11million (2002USD, $14.8million 2017USD).|$|E
5|$|September 3, 2013: Moisture {{from the}} {{remnants}} of Hurricane Kiko fueled a monsoon <b>across</b> the Southwestern United States, producing scattered showers and thunderstorms <b>across</b> the region.|$|E
5|$|Sheriff Hill compares unfavourably {{with the}} wider Gateshead area {{in respect of}} adults with {{educational}} qualifications. 50.7% of adults in the suburb have no educational qualifications, compared with 38.4% <b>across</b> Gateshead and with the England average of 28.9%. 25.2% of adults have five or more GCSEs or equivalent at grades A* to C compared with 46.6% <b>across</b> England, and 11.5% of adults in the suburb have two or more A-Levels or equivalent compared with the England average of 28.2% and 18.6% <b>across</b> Gateshead.|$|E
5|$|Snow {{was also}} {{reported}} <b>across</b> higher elevations in Colorado, Wyoming, Nebraska and Utah with local amounts {{of up to}} one foot (30cm) <b>across</b> central Colorado.|$|E
5|$|The Commandos {{were forced}} {{to spend the night}} {{freezing}} in the open in a ditch. The following day, after sappers from the Royal Engineers managed to erect a temporary bridge <b>across</b> the canal, a number of Churchill and Sherman tanks from the 8th Hussars managed to get <b>across</b> and No. 1 and No. 6 Troops climbed on top and advanced <b>across</b> the open ground and into the centre of the town.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in 2,550 cinemas <b>across</b> 3,550 screens in India, and <b>across</b> 700 screens internationallyincluding 196 screens in North America, 175 in the United Kingdom, 55 in the Middle East, and 30 in Australiathe widest Bollywood release up to that point.|$|E
5|$|The first {{railway bridge}} to Montreal Island was the Grand Trunk Railway bridge <b>across</b> the Ottawa River East Channel. Along with another bridge built {{simultaneously}} <b>across</b> the West Channel, this bridge provided the first fixed link from Montreal to the mainland. It {{was not until}} 1925, however, that a fixed road link, formed by Galipeault Bridge and Taschereau Bridge, was built <b>across</b> the Ottawa River from Montreal Island. Perrot Island {{was the only way}} out of Montreal to the West before the construction of Île aux Tourtes Bridge, which goes directly to Vaudreuil <b>across</b> the Lake of Two Mountains.|$|E
5|$|The {{intended}} {{flight path}} {{was a great}} circle route, which would have taken them <b>across</b> the English Channel, over the southwestern part of England and Ireland, <b>across</b> the Atlantic to Newfoundland, then south over Nova Scotia, to Boston, and finally to a water landing in New York.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{continued}} to hamper the 9th Division's advance. The 26th Brigade, further inland, remained {{stuck on the}} eastern side of the Busu. On 10 September, the commandos providing flank security managed to get <b>across</b> the Sankwep River, close to its confluence with the Busu, pushing a kunda bridge <b>across.</b> Shortly afterwards, they clashed with a small party of Japanese attempting to advance towards the bridge, and several Japanese were killed. To reinvigorate the 26th, engineer support was brought up. The 2/7th Field Company was pushing a jeep track forward with the help of the 2/48th, and they subsequently arrived with boats, ropes and cables, and several attempts were made to get <b>across,</b> all of which eventually failed as the engineers came under fire from the opposite bank. Heavy clashes later took place as the Australians and Japanese fought desperately in the swamp around the crossing. As it became uncertain whether the 26th would be able to force their way <b>across,</b> a company from the 2/48th was sent south to use the 24th Brigade's crossing and then advance north along the western bank of the Busu to help secure the brigade's beachhead when it finally did get <b>across.</b> on 13 September further engineer stores arrived, including bridging equipment and folding boats, and the following day a Small Box Girder bridge was pushed <b>across</b> despite heavy fire from the opposite bank, allowing the 26th Brigade to get <b>across</b> the Busu on 14 September.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Allison in 1989 stalled {{for three}} days <b>across</b> {{southeast}} Texas which led to prolonged rains <b>across</b> Arkansas. This way, Allison became the wettest known tropical cyclone to impact the state.|$|E
5|$|Users are {{no longer}} able to {{synchronize}} Start menu layouts <b>across</b> all devices associated with a Microsoft account. A Microsoft developer justified the change by explaining that a user may have different applications they want to emphasize on each device that they use, rather than use the same configuration <b>across</b> each device. The ability to automatically install a Windows Store app <b>across</b> all devices associated with an account was also removed.|$|E
5|$|Widespread <b>across</b> Australia, the Australian pelican has a {{population}} generally estimated at between 300,000 and 500,000 individuals. Overall population numbers fluctuate widely and erratically depending on wetland conditions and breeding success <b>across</b> the continent. The species is assessed as being of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|A protein called DMT1 is {{the major}} {{transporter}} in manganese absorption from the intestine, and may be the major transporter of manganese <b>across</b> the blood–brain barrier. DMT1 also transports inhaled manganese <b>across</b> the nasal epithelium. The proposed mechanism for manganese toxicity is that dysregulation leads to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, glutamate-mediated excitoxicity, and aggregation of proteins.|$|E
