5|$|A {{man with}} a tattooed tree {{on his chest and}} back is {{introduced}} in the opening minutes of Carnivàles pilot episode, and appears in many other Avataric visions and dreams: in Ben's and Brother Justin's common recurring dreams chasing Henry Scudder in a cornfield, in Ben's microsleep-like visions, in Sofie's visions of the rape of her mother, and in an extended vision of Brother Justin foreshadowing his dark future. Ben encounters <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> <b>with</b> a similar tree painted to his chest and back late in Season 1. Brother Justin finds this tree grown on a hill early in Season 2, which prompts him to get his chest and back tattooed accordingly. The tree is also depicted in the show's Gospel of Matthias book, in a painting at the Templar Hall in Loving, New Mexico, and on many images in the room of Templar chaplain Kerrigan. Management and Wilfred Talbot Smith imply the tree's significance for the resolution of Carnivàle.|$|E
500|$|In early 1994, {{the film}} was in {{pre-production}} with Christopher [...] "Fangorn" [...] Baker as concept artist, and Sara Maitland assisting on the story, which gave it [...] "a feminist fairy-tale focus". Maitland said that Kubrick never referred to the film as A.I., but as Pinocchio. Chris Cunningham became the new visual effects supervisor. Some of his unproduced work for A.I. {{can be seen on}} the DVD, The Work of Director Chris Cunningham. Aside from considering computer animation, Kubrick also had Joseph Mazzello do a screen test for the lead role. Cunningham helped assemble a series of [...] "little robot-type humans" [...] for the David character. [...] "We tried to construct <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> <b>with</b> a movable rubber face to see whether we could make it look appealing," [...] producer Jan Harlan reflected. [...] "But it was a total failure, it looked awful." [...] Hans Moravec was brought in as a technical consultant.|$|E

According to the Immortal Fruit Record, {{children}} of the Immortal Fruit will kill their mothers soon after birth. As a result, Kyo wanted Misao to abort the baby, but she refused. After discovering her pregnancy, Misao had recurring dreams of <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> <b>with</b> black wings and introduces himself as Sou, and discovers that it is her unborn son. Kyo comes {{to care about the}} baby once Misao tells him that Sou loves him. [...] When he is born, Misao survives the childbirth, and Misao and Kyo begin raising Sou as a family. Although he is well-loved by both of his parents, Sou is jealous that his father loves his mother more, and complains how strict Kyo is with him while Misao is very loving.|$|E

2500|$|Huckabee {{credited}} {{divine intervention}} for his rising poll numbers. [...] "There's only {{one explanation for}} it," [...] Huckabee said, [...] "and it's not a human one. It's the same power that helped <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> <b>with</b> two fish and five loaves feed a crowd of 5,000 people." [...] When the close proximity of the first contests to the holidays led to many candidates putting out Christmas ads and videos — allowing them to keep presenting their message but in a more appropriate setting — Huckabee chose one acknowledging that viewers were tired of political messages in the holiday season and that what [...] "really matters is {{the celebration of the}} birth of Christ," [...] avoiding other candidates' [...] "Happy holidays" [...] formulation. The ad generated considerable media discussion about whether a white bookshelf in the background was a subliminal Christian cross; [...] Huckabee mocked the suggestion and said it was just a bookshelf. [...] When asked about the ad and the thought of it being a cross, Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul stated that he had not seen the ad, but replied with the assumption that it was a cross, quoting Sinclair Lewis' warning that [...] "when fascism comes to this country, it will be wrapped in the flag, carrying a cross." ...|$|E

Plimpton takes Lisa aside and tells her that if she lets Alex win, she will be given a free scholarship to any Seven Sisters college—and a free George Plimpton hot plate ("it's perfect for soup!").

And {{the young man in}} gaiters {{to the left of the}} driver eyed Kipps and his banjo, and especially his banjo, ever and again as if he found it and him, with his rapt face, an insoluble enigma. And many a King has ridden into a conquered city with a lesser sense of splendour than Kipps.|$|E
6000|$|Throughout life, {{he always}} played his part, as in childhood, with full {{conscious}} and picturesque effect, {{as did the}} great Montrose and the English Admirals, in whom he notes this dramatic trait. He was not a poseur; he was merely sensitively conscious of himself and of life as an art. As <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> <b>with</b> curls and a velvet tunic, he read [...] "Ministering Children," [...] and yearned to be a ministering child. An opportunity seemed to present itself; the class of boys called [...] "keelies" [...] by the more comfortable boys in Edinburgh, used {{to play in the}} street under the windows of his father's house. One lame boy, a baker's son, could only look on. Here was a chance to minister! Louis, with a beating heart, walked out on his angelic mission.|$|E

So men--quite elderly, practical men, can blush, I thought to myself; for Dr Phelps had rather flushed than blushed; and my father used only to get red.|$|R

60|$|In {{the chamber}} where the mate lay, {{there were seven}} beds, all of them {{occupied}} by persons who had met with accidents. In {{the centre of the}} room was a stationary pine table, about the length of a man, intended, I suppose, to stretch patients upon for necessary operations. The furniture of the beds was plain and homely. I thought that the faces of the patients all looked remarkably intelligent, though they were evidently men of the lower classes. Suffering had educated them morally and intellectually. They gazed curiously at Mr. Wilding and me, but nobody said a word. In the bed next to the mate lay <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> <b>with</b> a broken thigh. The surgeon observed that children generally did well with accidents; and this boy certainly looked very bright and cheerful. There was nothing particularly interesting about the mate.|$|E

60|$|I {{made my way}} to {{the poor}} child, {{who was one of the}} dirtiest little unfortunates I ever saw, and found him very hot and frightened and crying loudly, fixed by the neck between two iron railings, while a milkman and a beadle, with the kindest {{intentions}} possible, were endeavouring to drag him back by the legs, under a general impression that his skull was compressible by those means. As I found (after pacifying him) that he was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>boy</b> <b>with</b> a naturally large head, I thought that perhaps where his head could go, his body could follow, and mentioned that the best mode of extrication might be to push him forward. This was so favourably received by the milkman and beadle that he would immediately have been pushed into the area if I had not held his pinafore while Richard and Mr. Guppy ran down through the kitchen to catch him when he should be released. At last he was happily got down without any accident, and then he began to beat Mr. Guppy with a hoop-stick in quite a frantic manner.|$|E

After an explanation of how the magic umbrella works, the two children, joined by Cap'n Bill, decide to take a trip to a nearby island; they call it [...] "Sky island," [...] because it looks like it's [...] "halfway in the sky"—but the umbrella takes them to a different place entirely, a literal island in the sky.|$|R
