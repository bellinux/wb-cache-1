5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{political}} affiliation in the Senate {{in the most}} recent era is distinct in several key respects from what has been the case historically. Since November 4, 2015, there has been no government caucus in the Senate because the Senate Liberal Caucus is not affiliated with the governing Liberal Party of Canada. On December 6, 2016, {{for the first time in}} Canadian history the number of senators without <b>a</b> <b>partisan</b> affiliation exceeded that of the largest caucus of senators with <b>a</b> <b>partisan</b> affiliation.|$|E

5|$|King Nechtan son of Der-Ile abdicated {{to enter}} a monastery in 724 and was imprisoned by his {{successor}} Drest in 726. In 728 and 729, four kings competed for power in Pictland: Drest; Nechtan; Alpín, of whom little is known; and lastly Óengus, who was <b>a</b> <b>partisan</b> of Nechtan, and perhaps his acknowledged heir.|$|E

Caleb Powers, who had been Sampson's college roommate, now joined him {{as a partner in}} his law firm. Powers would later be accused of complicity to the assassination of Governor William Goebel. Because Powers was convicted by <b>a</b> <b>partisan</b> jury, he became a political martyr to many Republicans, and Sampson's connection to him became a boon in heavily Republican eastern Kentucky.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the writer}} Branko Ćopić, who was <b>a</b> <b>Partisan</b> in Grmeč, Stojanović was greeted by a crowd of villagers and welcomed with the {{traditional}} bread and salt ceremony when he crossed the Sana River. Prominent villagers shook hands with him, and they compared him with Miloš Obilića famous Serbian epic hero from the medieval Battle of Kosovo. Several women approached Stojanović to kiss his hands; he declined this mark of respect, {{saying that he was}} not a priest but a communist.|$|E
5|$|Atrash {{continued}} to hold the office of RCC, and was reelected as speaker on 15 February 1966, shortly before the 1966 Syrian coup d'état (21–23 February), which brought the left-wing neo-Ba'athist government of Jadid to power and caused an internal party split. The Jadid government's coming to power resulted in the self-imposed exile of the leading Ba'ath ideologue Michel Aflaq. Atrash, <b>a</b> <b>partisan</b> of Aflaq, was arrested and jailed in the Mezzeh Prison during the coup. The new defense minister and future president Hafez al-Assad later paid him a visit to discuss Syria's political situation and check on his health.|$|E

5|$|Diệm {{used the}} Ministry of Information's electoral {{education}} campaign as <b>a</b> <b>partisan</b> political tool.

After explaining what democracy was, a pamphlet outlined why Deposing a chief-of-state is a vital act. After elaborating on {{the powers of the}} head of state, the pamphlet went on to champion Diệm as an anti-communist who could defend people's freedom, while explaining why Bảo Đại was unfit to lead, saying {{that he did not have}} respect among the international community.|$|E
5|$|On 17 September 1939, {{after signing}} a {{cease-fire}} with Japan, the Soviets invaded Poland from the east.

Poland's territory was divided between Germany and the Soviet Union, with Lithuania and Slovakia also receiving small shares. After the defeat of Poland's armed forces, the Polish resistance established an Underground State and <b>a</b> <b>partisan</b> Home Army. About 100,000 Polish military personnel were evacuated to Romania and the Baltic countries; many of these soldiers later fought against the Germans in other theatres of the war.

5|$|The board {{claimed that}} the Goebel Election Law did not give them the power to hear proof of vote fraud or call witnesses, {{although}} the wording of their decision implied {{that they would have}} invalidated Taylor votes if they had been empowered to do so.

5|$|The {{following}} year, Sharp's brother, Dr. Leander Sharp, wrote Vindication of the Character of the Late Col. Solomon P. Sharp {{to defend}} him from the charges contained in Beauchamp's confession. In Vindication, Dr. Sharp portrayed the killing as a political assassination: he named Patrick Darby, <b>a</b> <b>partisan</b> of the Anti-Relief faction, as co-conspirator with Beauchamp, an Anti-Relief stalwart. Darby threatened to sue Sharp if he published his Vindication; and Waring threatened to kill him. Heeding these threats, Sharp did not publish his work; all extant manuscripts remained in his house, where they were discovered many years later during a remodeling.|$|E
5|$|After Negron {{gets his}} damaged {{backpack}} radio working, the soldiers contact headquarters and {{are told to}} capture an enemy soldier. A local Partisan group arrives with a young German deserter, Hans Brundt, as their prisoner. Earlier, residents of the nearby village of Sant'Anna di Stazzema were killed by German forces following a betrayal by <b>a</b> <b>partisan,</b> named Rodolfo, who knows that Brundt can identify him as the traitor. After concealing the fact that German forces are approaching the village in a counterattack, Rodolfo kills Brundt and the Partisan leader before escaping. It is Rodolfo whom Negron will kill 39 years later. Captain Nokes arrives in the village to interrogate Brundt and finds him dead. The Americans prepare to leave the village ahead of a German counterattack, but Sam refuses to leave Angelo behind. After promising to court-martial all four soldiers, Nokes and his contingent drive out of town, but he is killed in the opening German offensive.|$|E
5|$|After William's {{death in}} 1164, Hugh passed into royal service, while also serving as seneschal {{to the new}} Earl of Surrey, Hamelin, the illegitimate {{half-brother}} of King Henry II. On the Cartae Baronum in 1166 he held one knight's fee in the barony of Giffard. In 1167 Hugh paid a fine that is recorded in the pipe rolls for the custody of his nephew's lands at Tickhill. In 1170, he {{was present at the}} coronation of Henry the Young King in June at Westminster Abbey, when Henry II had his heir crowned as a king during the elder Henry's lifetime. During the Revolt of 1173–74 by King Henry's sons, Hugh was <b>a</b> <b>partisan</b> of the king. The revolt was brought about by the desire of Henry's three oldest sons to gain some power during Henry's reign, and by mid 1174 the revolt had been defeated by the king. During the Revolt, Hugh fought at the Battle of Fornham near Fornham St Martin in Suffolk, a victory for royalist forces, but otherwise took little part in the revolt's suppression.|$|E
