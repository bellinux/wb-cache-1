5|$|Antibody and antigen {{interact}} by spatial complementarity (lock and key). The molecular forces {{involved in}} the Fab-epitope interaction are weak and non-specific – for example electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals forces. This means binding between antibody and antigen is reversible, and the antibody's affinity towards an antigen is relative rather than absolute. Relatively weak binding <b>also</b> <b>means</b> {{it is possible for}} an antibody to cross-react with different antigens of different relative affinities.|$|E
5|$|Creationist sources {{frequently}} define evolution {{according to}} a colloquial, rather than scientific, meaning. As a result, many attempts to rebut evolution do not address the findings of evolutionary biology (see straw man argument). This <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that advocates of creationism and evolutionary biologists often simply speak past each other.|$|E

5000|$|Zlango {{included}} more than 300 icons {{in several different}} categories. The icons are not definitive, and most icons have multiple meanings: for example, the icon for [...] "me" [...] can <b>also</b> <b>mean</b> [...] "I", the icon for [...] "go" [...] can <b>also</b> <b>mean</b> [...] "come", and the icon for [...] "car" [...] can <b>also</b> <b>mean</b> [...] "drive". The meanings that Zlango intended for each icon were only suggestions as Zlango encouraged users to invent their own personal meanings for icons.|$|R

5|$|Equality before law: Article 14 of the {{constitution}} guarantees that all people shall be equally protected {{by the laws of}} the country. It means that the State will treat people in the same circumstances alike. This article <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that individuals, whether citizens of India or otherwise shall be treated differently if the circumstances are different.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-5b is a Hot Jupiter with a {{mass that}} is 2.114 times that of Jupiter and a radius of 1.431 times Jupiter's radius. This <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that Kepler-5b is not very dense. The planet's {{measured}} density is 0.894grams/cm3, {{less than that of}} pure water and comparable only to the density of Saturn, which is approximately 0.69grams/cm3. The planet has an equilibrium temperature of 1868 K, making it fifteen times hotter than Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} {{diffusion}} damping is greatly augmented by the finite {{width of the}} surface of last scattering (SLS). The finite width of the SLS means the CMB photons we see were not all emitted at the same time, and the fluctuations we see are not all in phase. It <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that during recombination, the diffusion length changed dramatically, as the ionisation fraction shifted.|$|E

50|$|Rendition can <b>also</b> <b>mean</b> {{the act of}} rendering, i.e. delivering, a {{judicial}} decision, or of explaining a series of events, as a defendant or witness. It can <b>also</b> <b>mean</b> the execution of {{a judicial}} order by the directed parties. But extraordinary rendition is distinct from both deportation and extradition, being inherently illegal.|$|R
5|$|The wet {{season is}} the main period of {{vegetation}} growth within the Savanna climate regime. However, this <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that wet season {{is a time for}} food shortages before crops reach their full maturity. This causes seasonal weight changes for people in developing countries, with a drop occurring during the wet season until {{the time of the first}} harvest, when weights rebound. Malaria incidence increases during periods of high temperature and heavy rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Aurion {{takes its}} doors, windows, roof panels, body sides (except front quarters) from the Camry XV40. However, the other panels are unique {{from the regular}} Camry. This {{component}} sharing <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that Aurion has the same wheelbase, front and rear axle tracks, and interior dimensions. Interior design also largely parallels the Camry. Notable differences include the redesigned upper dashboard portion and restyled centre console, plus the substitution of the Australian Camry's hand-operated parking brake with a foot-operated equivalent (as shared with the Camry for Japan and North America). The reasoning behind this component sharing strategy was to reduce costs and to allow the car to be built alongside the Camry, thus simplifying the manufacturing process.|$|E
5|$|Every 3-colorable graph G that {{contains}} a triangle (that is, has the complete graph K3 as a subgraph) is homomorphically equivalent to K3. This is because, on one hand, a 3-coloring of G {{is the same as}} a homomorphism G → K3, as explained below. On the other hand, every subgraph of G trivially admits a homomorphism into G, implying K3 → G. This <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that K3 is the core of any such graph G. Similarly, every bipartite graph that has at least one edge is equivalent to K2.|$|E

5|$|Lithium {{fluoride}} is {{the only}} alkali metal halide that is poorly soluble in water, and lithium hydroxide {{is the only}} alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent. Conversely, lithium perchlorate and other lithium salts with large anions that cannot be polarised are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other alkali metals, probably because Li+ has a high solvation energy. This effect <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that most simple lithium salts are commonly encountered in hydrated form, because the anhydrous forms are extremely hygroscopic: this allows salts like lithium chloride and lithium bromide {{to be used in}} dehumidifiers and air-conditioners.|$|E
5|$|The {{automobile}} {{is by far}} {{the dominant}} form of transport in Canberra. The city is laid out so that arterial roads connecting inhabited clusters run through undeveloped areas of open land or forest, which results in a low population density; this <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that idle land is available for the development of future transport corridors if necessary without the need to build tunnels or acquire developed residential land. In contrast, other capital cities in Australia have substantially less green space.|$|E
5|$|The {{dynamical}} {{isolation of}} Callisto {{means that it}} has never been appreciably tidally heated, which has important consequences for its internal structure and evolution. Its distance from Jupiter <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that the charged-particle flux from Jupiter's magnetosphere at its surface is relatively lowabout 300 times lower than, for example, that at Europa. Hence, unlike the other Galilean moons, charged-particle irradiation has had a relatively minor effect on Callisto's surface. The radiation level at Callisto's surface is equivalent to a dose of about 0.01 rem (0.1 mSv) per day, which is over ten times higher than Earth's average background radiation.|$|E

5|$|The modern name of {{the river}} is {{comparatively}} recent, probably dating from around the sixteenth century. It {{is derived from the}} village and hundred of Rotherfield, located where the river rises. Rotherfield means 'open land of the cattle', based on the Old English Hrydera-feld. Prior to being called the Rother, it was known as the Limen throughout its length. This is a Celtic word meaning 'river'. In several Anglo-Saxon charters, it is suffixed with -ea, appearing as Limenea, where the suffix <b>also</b> <b>means</b> 'river', but in Old English. During the thirteenth century, it was known as the River of Newenden.|$|E
5|$|The spit {{is moving}} towards the {{mainland}} at about 1m per year, {{and for the}} last two hundred years maps have been accurate enough for the encroachment of the sea to be quantified. Blakeney Chapel, just west of the reserve, was 400m (440yd) from the sea in 1817, but this had reduced to 195m (215yd) {{by the end of the}} twentieth century. The landward movement of the shingle <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that the channel of the River Glaven becomes blocked increasingly often, leading to flooding of the reserve and Cley village. The Environment Agency considered a number of remedial options to protect these vulnerable areas, and a new route for the river to the south of its original line was completed in 2007 at a cost of about £1.5million.|$|E
5|$|Thorium is {{odourless}} and tasteless. The chemical {{toxicity of}} thorium is low because thorium and its most common compounds (mostly the dioxide) are poorly soluble in water, precipitating out {{before entering the}} body as the hydroxide. Some thorium compounds are chemically moderately toxic, especially {{in the presence of}} strong complex-forming ions such as citrate that carry the thorium into the body in soluble form. If thorium is ingested, 0.4% of it and 90% of its dangerous daughters are leached into the body. Out of the thorium that does remain in the body, three quarters of it accumulates in the skeleton. Absorption through the skin is possible, but is not a likely means of exposure. Thorium's low solubility in water <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that excretion of thorium by the kidneys and faeces is rather slow.|$|E

5|$|Cold {{cyclones}} {{are stronger}} aloft {{than at the}} Earth's surface, or stronger {{in areas of the}} troposphere with lower pressures, per the thermal wind relationship and the hypsometric equation. The hypsometric equation dictates that colder atmospheres have less room between pressure surfaces, which corresponds to the concept of lower atmospheric thickness, and the thermal wind relation indicates that in this situation, the wind increases with height. It <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that an isolated pool of cold air aloft is associated with the feature. Because of its cold center, the center shows an area of thickness minimum. Since the temperature at any given radius is similar and parallel to the orientation of the pressure gradient, and therefore the wind, it is barotropic in nature. The movement of cold-core cyclones can be erratic since they are separated from the main belt of the Westerlies, which would otherwise steer them progressively to the east.|$|E
5|$|In much of {{the western}} half of the corn crake's {{breeding}} range, there have been long-term declines {{that are expected to}} continue, although conservation measures have enabled numbers to grow in several countries, including substantial increases in the small populations in Finland, the UK and the Netherlands. The breeding population had begun to decline in the 19th century, but the process gained pace after World War II. The main cause of the steep declines in much of Europe is the loss of nests and chicks from early mowing. Haymaking dates have moved forward in the past century due to faster crop growth, made possible by land drainage and the use of fertilisers, and the move from manual grass-cutting using scythes to mechanical mowers, at first horse-drawn and later pulled by tractors. Mechanisation <b>also</b> <b>means</b> that large areas can be cut quickly, leaving the crake with no alternative sites to raise either a first brood if suitable habitat has gone, or a replacement brood if the first nest is destroyed. The pattern of mowing, typically in a circular pattern from the outside of a field to its centre, gives little chance of escape for the chicks, which are also exposed to potential animal predators. Adults can often escape the mowers, although some incubating females sit tight on the nest, with fatal results.|$|E
5|$|Lion's {{share of}} Ireland has with most likehood been {{above sea level}} during the last 60 million years. As such its landscapes have been shaped by erosion and {{weathering}} on land. Protracted erosion does <b>also</b> <b>means</b> most of the Paleogene and Neogene sediments have been eroded away or, as known in a few cases, buried by Quaternary deposits. Before the Quaternary glaciations affected Ireland the landscape had developed thick weathered regolith on the uplands and karst in the lowlands. There have been some controversy regarding {{the origin of the}} planation surfaces found on Ireland. While some have argued for an origin in marine planation others regard these surfaces as peneplains formed by weathering and fluvial erosion. Not only is their origin disputed but also their actual extent and the relative role of sea-level change and tectonics in their shaping. Most river systems in Ireland formed in the Cenozoic before the Quaternary glaciations. Rivers follow for most of their course structural features of the geology of Ireland. Marine erosion since the Miocene might have made Ireland's western coast retreat more than 100 km. Pre-Quaternary relief was more dramatic than today's glacier-smoothened landscapes.|$|E
