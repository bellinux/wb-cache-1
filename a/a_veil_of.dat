The author criticizes her grandmother as a distant, gun-toting, larger-than-life figure who cast <b>a</b> <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> pain and secrecy over her family so vast that Ms. Vilar is still untangling herself from it. It also documents the death of Lebrón's only daughter (Vilar's mother) as suicide.|$|E
5|$|Within the tropics, 36hours {{prior to}} the center passage of a {{tropical}} cyclone, <b>a</b> <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> white cirrus clouds approaches {{from the direction of}} the cyclone. In the mid to late 19th century, forecasters used these cirrus veils to predict the arrival of hurricanes. In the early 1870s the president of Belén College in Havana, Cuba, Father Benito Viñes, developed the first hurricane forecasting system, and he mainly used the motion of these clouds in formulating his predictions. He would observe the clouds hourly from 4:00 am to 10:00 pm. After accumulating enough information, Viñes began accurately predicting the paths of hurricanes, and he eventually summarized his observations in his book, Apuntes Relativos a los Huracanes de las Antilles.|$|E
5|$|The social {{contract}} theory of political philosopher John Rawls, developed {{in his work}} A Theory of Justice, was influenced by Kant's ethics. Rawls argued that a just society would be fair. To achieve this fairness, he proposed a hypothetical moment prior {{to the existence of}} a society, at which the society is ordered: this is the original position. This should take place from behind <b>a</b> <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> ignorance, where no one knows what their own position in society will be, preventing people from being biased by their own interests and ensuring a fair result. Rawls' theory of justice rests on the belief that individuals are free, equal, and moral; he regarded all human beings as possessing some degree of reasonableness and rationality, which he saw as the constituents of morality and entitling their possessors to equal justice. Rawls dismissed much of Kant's dualism, arguing that the structure of Kantian ethics, once reformulated, is clearer without it—he described this as {{one of the goals of}} A Theory of Justice.|$|E

5|$|The special {{visual effects}} for Raiders were {{provided}} by Industrial Light & Magic and include: a matte shot to establish the Pan Am flying boat {{in the water and}} miniature work to show the plane taking off and flying, superimposed over a map; animation effects for the beam in the Tanis map room; and a miniature car and passengers superimposed over a matte painting for a shot of a Nazi car being forced off a cliff. The bulk of effects shots were featured in the climactic sequence wherein the Ark of the Covenant (which was designed by Brian Muir and Keith Short) is opened and God's wrath is unleashed. This sequence featured animation, a woman to portray a beautiful spirit's face, rod puppet spirits moved through water to convey a sense of floating, a matte painting of the island, and cloud tank effects to portray clouds. The melting of Toht's head was done by exposing a gelatine and plaster model of Ronald Lacey's head to a heat lamp with an under-cranked camera, while Dietrich's crushed head was a hollow model from which air was withdrawn. When the film was originally submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America, it received an R rating because of the scene in which Belloq's head explodes. The filmmakers were able to receive a PG rating when they added <b>a</b> <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> fire over the exploding head scene. (PG-13 rating was not created until 1984.) The firestorm that cleanses the canyon at the finish was a miniature canyon filmed upside down.|$|E

25|$|The Bhopal medical {{community}} {{was faced with}} 1) the urgent health care needs of the affected community, 2) the non-availability of toxicological and accident-related information, 3) the extreme sensitivity of local and national government bodies toward {{all aspects of the}} disaster, 4) lack of expertise, and 5) the lack of funds available to independent researchers to conduct investigations. Faced with lawsuits and the prospect of bankruptcy, Union Carbide’s efforts to keep open channels of communication were highly inadequate to address these issues and were {{considered by many to be}} a major human rights violation. In addition, the transnational political and legal ramifications served to throw <b>a</b> <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> secrecy around the disaster, thus impeding the discovery of essential pieces of information. Medical, toxicological, and accident-analysis data were not made public, thereby frustrating the efforts of the {{medical community}} to understand the linkage between exposures and health effects and devise appropriate treatment strategies. As an example, the lack of information about whether MIC could thermally decompose to hydrocyanic acid led to years of contentious debate on the merits of treating the gas victims for cyanide poisoning and an unfortunate violation of patient confidentiality.|$|E

500|$|The {{first two}} Courageous-class battlecruisers were {{designed}} in 1915 {{to meet a}} set of requirements laid down by the First Sea Lord, Admiral Fisher, with his Baltic Project in mind. They were to {{be large enough to}} ensure that they could maintain their speed in heavy weather, have a powerful armament and a speed of at least [...] to allow them to outrun enemy light cruisers. Their protection was to be light for a cruiser, with [...] of armour between the waterline and the forecastle deck, anti-torpedo bulges amidships and the machinery as far inboard as possible, protected by triple torpedo bulkheads. Shallow draught was of the utmost importance and all other factors were to be subordinated to this. The Director of Naval Construction (DNC), Sir Eustace Tennyson-d'Eyncourt, responded on 23 February 1915 with a smaller version of the s with one less gun turret and reduced armour protection. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had forbidden any further construction of ships larger than light cruisers in 1915, so Fisher designated the ships as large light cruisers to evade this prohibition. If this restriction had not been in place, the ships would have been built as improved versions of the preceding Renown class. The two ships were laid down a few months later under <b>a</b> <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> secrecy, so they became known in the Royal Navy as [...] "Lord Fisher's [...] cruisers" [...] and their odd design also earned them the nickname of the Outrageous class.|$|E
500|$|The Man-Eating Myth was {{reviewed}} by Ivan Brady for the American Anthropologist journal. He {{noted that the}} framework for Arens' scepticism was not coherent and was never spelled out explicitly in the text, even {{if it could be}} deduced from reading the entirety of the work. Brady sees this framework as an [...] "unsophisticated" [...] version of positivism and naturalism, an approach that he laments was becoming increasingly popular in anthropology. Casting a critical eye over Arens' scepticism, he admits to being perplexed as to why only [...] "direct observation" [...] will do as evidence, pondering whether Arens would accept anything short of affidavits by practicing cannibals as evidence for the practice. Brady notes that there are other activities in the world that surely go on [...] such as masturbation in monasteries and homosexual activity in the armed forces [...] but that these would be hidden by <b>a</b> <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> secrecy and therefore difficult to observe directly, suggesting that the same may be true for cannibalism. Moving on, Brady attacks Arens' criticism of anthropology, believing that he has constructed a straw man argument by comparing the early accounts of travellers to the later, 20th-century accounts of anthropologists, and lambasts him for portraying himself as an objective figure in the debate. He argues that in cases such as that of the Carib people, the evidence for cannibalism is [...] "indeterminate", rather than negative, as Arens believes. Concluding his review, Brady admits that he agrees with Arens' premise that socially accepted cannibalism is not as globally widespread as some anthropologists have suggested, but disagreed that anthropologists have been as [...] "reckless" [...] in their claims as Arens charges them with, and furthermore disagrees with Arens' suggestion that the cause can be blamed on poor observation standards.|$|E
500|$|About {{four days}} in advance of a typical {{tropical}} cyclone, an ocean [...] of [...] in height will roll in about every 10 seconds, moving towards the coast {{from the direction of}} the tropical cyclone's location. [...] The ocean swell will slowly increase in height and frequency the closer a tropical cyclone gets to land. [...] Two days in advance of the center's passage, winds go calm as the tropical cyclone interrupts the environmental wind flow. [...] Within 36 hours of the center passage, the pressure begins to fall and <b>a</b> <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> white cirrus clouds approaches from the cyclone's direction. [...] Within 24 hours of the closest approach to the center, low clouds begin to move in, also known as the bar of a tropical cyclone, as the barometric pressure begins to fall more rapidly and the winds begin to increase. [...] Within 18 hours of the center's approach, squally weather is common, with sudden increases in wind accompanied by rain showers or thunderstorms. [...] Winds increase within 12 hours of the center's approach, occasionally reaching hurricane force. [...] The ocean's surface becomes whipped with foam. [...] Small items begin flying in the wind. [...] Within 6 hours of the center's arrival, rain becomes continuous and the storm surge begins to come inland. [...] Within an hour of the center, the rain becomes very heavy and the highest winds within the tropical cyclone are experienced. [...] When the center arrives with a strong tropical cyclone, weather conditions improve and the sun becomes visible as the eye moves overhead. [...] At this point, the pressure ceases to drop as the lowest pressure within the storm's center is reached. [...] This is also when the peak depth of the storm surge occurs. [...] Once the system departs, winds reverse and, along with the rain, suddenly increase. [...] The storm surge retreats as the pressure suddenly rises in the wake of its center. [...] One day after the center's passage, the low overcast is replaced with a higher overcast, and the rain becomes intermittent. [...] By 36 hours after the center's passage, the high overcast breaks and the pressure begins to level off.|$|E

500|$|Between the {{engagement}} and the wedding, Alice's father Prince Albert died on 14 December 1861. Despite the Queen's grief, she ordered that the wedding should continue as planned. On 1 July 1862, Alice and Louis were married privately {{in the dining}} room of Osborne House, which was converted into a temporary chapel. The Queen was ushered in by her four sons, acting as a living screen blocking her from view, and took her place in an armchair near the altar. Alice was given away by her uncle, Albert's brother Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and was flanked by four bridesmaids: her younger sisters, Princesses Helena, Louise and Beatrice, as well as Louis's sister Princess Anna. For the ceremony, Alice wore a white dress with <b>a</b> <b>veil</b> <b>of</b> Honiton lace, but was required to wear black mourning clothes before and after the ceremony. The Queen, sitting in an armchair, struggled to hold back her tears, and was shielded from view by the Prince of Wales and Prince Alfred, her second son, who cried throughout the service. The weather at Osborne was dreary, with winds blowing up from the Channel. The Queen wrote to her eldest daughter, Victoria, that the ceremony was [...] "more of a funeral than a wedding", and remarked to Alfred, Lord Tennyson that it was [...] "the saddest day I can remember". The Queen gave her daughter a gold, diamond and pearl bracelet, inscribed as a gift from both parents To dear Alice from her loving parents Albert and Victoria R who though visibly parted are ever united, April 25, 1863. The ceremony—described by Gerard Noel as [...] "the saddest royal wedding in modern times"—was over by 4pm, and the couple set off for their honeymoon at St Claire in Ryde, a house lent to them by the Vernon Harcourt family. Alice's entourage consisted of Lady Churchill, General Seymour and Baron Westerweller (a Hessian courtier). Alice was careful not to displease the Queen after her marriage. When the Queen visited the couple at St Claire, Alice tried not to appear [...] "too happy". Despite this, Alice's displays of romantic bliss made the Queen jealous of her daughter's happiness.|$|E
