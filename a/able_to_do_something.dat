For him, [...] "Everything is so internal with Sweeney that [...] is like his emotional release. It's more about catharsis than it is a literal thing." [...] Producer Richard D. Zanuck said that [...] " [...] had a very clear plan that he wanted to lift that up into a surreal, almost Kill Bill kind of stylization. We had done tests and experiments with the neck slashing, with the blood popping out. I remember saying to Tim, 'My God, do we dare do this?'" [...] On set, the fake blood was colored orange to render correctly on the desaturated color film used, and crew members wore bin liners to avoid getting stained while filming. This macabre tone made some studios nervous, and it was not until Warner Bros., DreamWorks and Paramount had signed up for the project that the film's $50 million budget was covered. Burton said [...] "the studio was cool about it and they accepted it because they knew what the show was.

500|$|Hutton then leg glanced Miller, before cover {{driving and}} square cutting him in another over. All three shots went for four {{and he reached}} his fifty in 110 minutes. Miller responded to the spate of {{boundaries}} {{with a series of}} bouncers, including five in the last over of the day. One of these struck Hutton high on his left arm. The batsmen survived, but Miller received a hostile reaction from the crowd throughout his short-pitched barrage, including shouts of [...] "Bodyline". The original practitioners of Bodyline, Harold Larwood and Bill Voce, were both from Nottinghamshire and played at Trent Bridge, and were later excluded from selection for England after being blamed for the ill-feeling caused by Bodyline. The Nottinghamshire supporters were still angry with how their players had been removed and were not happy that Miller was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> they saw to be equivalent. For his part, Miller appeared to be amused by the crowd reaction and revelled in it, grinning and flicking his hair. However, Hutton had the last word, glancing Miller down to fine leg for a four from the final ball of the day. England were 121/2, with Hutton and Compton on 63 and 36 respectively. Miller was widely jeered and heckled as he walked off the field, and the crowded surged towards him as he walked up the steps into the dressing room. O'Reilly defended Miller's use of short-pitched deliveries, pointing out that he had not employed a packed leg side field and had allowed the batsman the opportunity to score from hook and pull shots if he was willing to try; in contrast the packed Bodyline field meant batsmen would find little reward for such shots and defensive play would only lead to dismissal.|$|E

In relation to a necessary test for the existence of {{moral responsibility}}, John Martin Fischer and Mark Ravizza (Fischer, 1994; Fischer & Ravizza, 1998) proposed a theory which determines a person as morally responsible for an action {{to the extent to which}} they can produce justifications determined by moral reasoning. Such theory presupposes the capacity to critically examine motivations and sources of actions, and thus the ability to recognise moral reasons for or against an action, together with the ability to translate these reasons and motivations into ethical actions.

40|$|The {{literature}} on worker cooperatives {{is dominated by}} explanations of why they do not work and why, accordingly, they are so rare. This article presents {{a case study of}} a large worker cooperative in South India that has worked well for a long time. This cooperative illustrates, among other things, that worker control and worker democracy are not necessarily inconsistent with the degree of hierarchy and delegation that may be essential to effective operation. The cooperative has been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> compete despite paying wages and benefits that are dramatically higher than those paid by its competitors, {{while at the same time}} providing far better working conditions. How it has been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this is <b>something</b> of a puzzle. Part of the explanation is good fortune at its inceptoin in attracting effective, honest, and dedicated managers and, subsequently, in avoiding government involvement and in being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> ignore cumbersome and unsuitable legal rules. Perhaps more important is the workplace culture and the ability to harness froms of mutual monitoring not available to competitors. At the end of the day, it is unclear how much of the success of the cooperative is a function of its cooperative nature and how much is a product of its unique circumstances. Still, the story of this enterprise offers useful lessons in the organization of economic activity, particularly in the importance of nonlegal mechanisms for maximizing individual cooperative productivity...|$|R
60|$|It {{was near}} flood-tide {{when we went}} back. I stood up and kept a keen watch for little muddy places in the water, also bonefish. At last I saw several fish, and there we anchored.

The third time he yelled as he struck, and I turned in time to see the white thresh of a bonefish. He made a quick dash off to the side and then came in close to the boat, swimming around with short runs two or three times, and then, apparently tired, he came close. I made ready to lift him into the boat, when, lo and behold! he made a wonderful run of fully three hundred feet before R. C. could stop him. Finally he was led to the boat, and turned out to be a fish of three and a half pounds. It simply made R. C. and me gasp to speak of what a really large bonefish might be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> There is <b>something</b> irresistible about the pursuit of these fish, and perhaps this is it. We changed places, and as a last try anchored in deeper water, fishing as before. This time I had a distinct tug at my line and I hooked a fish. He wiggled and jerked and threshed around so that I told R. C. that it was not a bonefish, but R. C. contended it was. Anyway, he came toward the boat rather easily until we saw him and he saw us, and then he made a dash similar to that of R. C.'s fish and he tore out the hook. This was the extent of our adventure that day, and we were very much pleased.|$|R
