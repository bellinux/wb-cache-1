25|$|Since {{cardiovascular}} {{disease is a}} serious complication associated with diabetes, some have recommended blood pressure levels below 130/80mmHg.

Among medications that lower blood pressure, <b>angiotensin</b> <b>converting</b> enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) improve outcomes in those with DM while the similar medications angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) do not.

25|$|Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone {{system is}} a major blood {{pressure}} regulating mechanism. Markers of electrolyte and water imbalance in the body such as hypotension, low distal tubule sodium concentration, decreased blood volume and high sympathetic tone trigger {{the release of the}} enzyme renin from the cells of juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidney. Renin activates a circulating liver derived prohormone angiotensinogen by proteolytic cleavage of all but its first ten amino acid residues known as angiotensin I. ACE (<b>Angiotensin</b> <b>converting</b> enzyme) then removes a further two residues, converting angiotensin I into angiotensin II. ACE is found in the pulmonary circulation and in the endothelium of many blood vessels. The system increases blood pressure by increasing the amount of salt and water the body retains, although angiotensin is also very good at causing the blood vessels to tighten (a potent vasoconstrictor).|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{a wide variety of}} drugs that can trigger dysgeusia, {{including}} zopiclone, H1-antihistamines, such as azelastine and emedastine. Approximately 250 drugs affect taste.

Saliva can have traces of the drug, giving rise to a metallic flavor in the mouth; examples include lithium carbonate and tetracyclines. Drugs containing sulfhydryl groups, including penicillamine and captopril, may react with zinc and cause deficiency. Metronidazole and chlorhexidine have been found to interact with metal ions that associate with the cell membrane. Drugs that prevent the production of angiotensin II by inhibiting <b>angiotensin</b> <b>converting</b> enzyme, eprosartan for example, have been linked to dysgeusia.

25|$|Another system {{maintaining}} the extracellular fluid volume, peripheral resistance, {{and that if}} disturbed may lead to hypertension, is the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Renin is a circulating enzyme that participates in maintaining extracellular volume and arterial vasoconstriction, therefore contributing to regulation of blood pressure. It performs this function by breaking down (hydrolysing) angiotensinogen, secreted from the liver, into the peptide angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is further cleaved by an enzyme that is located primarily but not exclusively in the pulmonary circulation bound to endothelium; that enzyme is <b>angiotensin</b> <b>converting</b> enzyme (ACE). This cleavage produces angiotensin II, the most vasoactive peptide. Angiotensin II is a potent constrictor of all blood vessels. It acts on the musculature of arteries, raising peripheral resistance and thereby elevating blood pressure. Angiotensin II also causes the adrenal glands to release aldosterone, which stimulates the epithelial cells of the kidneys to increase re-absorption of salt and water, leading to raised blood volume and raised blood pressure. So elevated renin levels in the blood (normally 1.98-2.46ng/ml in the upright position) leads to hypertension.|$|E
25|$|Proteins {{constitute}} 90-95% of venom's {{dry weight}} {{and they are}} responsible for almost all of its biological effects. Among hundreds, even thousands of proteins found in venom, there are toxins, neurotoxins in particular, as well as nontoxic proteins (which also have pharmacological properties), and many enzymes, especially hydrolytic ones. Enzymes (molecular weight 13-150 KDa) make-up 80-90% of viperid and 25-70% of elapid venoms: digestive hydrolases, L-amino acid oxidase, phospholipases, thrombin-like pro-coagulant, and kallikrein-like serine proteases and metalloproteinases (hemorrhagins), which damage vascular endothelium. Polypeptide toxins (molecular weight 5-10 KDa) include cytotoxins, cardiotoxins, and postsynaptic neurotoxins (such as α-bungarotoxin and α-Cobratoxin), which bind to acetylcholine receptors at neuromuscular junctions. Compounds with low molecular weight (up to 1.5 KDa) include metals, peptides, lipids, nucleosides, carbohydrates, amines, and oligopeptides, which inhibit <b>angiotensin</b> <b>converting</b> enzyme (ACE) and potentiate bradykinin (BPP). Inter- and intra-species variation in venom chemical composition is geographical and ontogenic. Phosphodiesterases interfere with the prey's cardiac system, mainly to lower the blood pressure. Phospholipase A2 causes hemolysis by lysing the phospholipid cell membranes of red blood cells. Amino acid oxidases and proteases are used for digestion. Amino acid oxidase also triggers some other enzymes and is responsible for the yellow colour of the venom of some species. Hyaluronidase increases tissue permeability to accelerate absorption of other enzymes into tissues. Some snake venoms carry fasciculins, like the mambas (Dendroaspis), which inhibit cholinesterase to make the prey lose muscle control.|$|E

Skin chymotryptic proteinase, cathepsin G, and tonin cleaved the phe 8 - his 9 bond of <b>angiotensin</b> I and <b>converted</b> <b>angiotensin</b> I to angiotensin II without further degradation. In contrast, chymase formed relatively small amounts of angiotensin II because it preferentially cleaved the tyr 4 -ile 5 bond of angiotensin I. The rank order of <b>angiotensin</b> I <b>converting</b> activity was skin ehymotryptic proteinase > tonin > cathepsin G > chymase. The Km and Kcat for angiotensin I conversion by the human skin enzyme were 6. 6 × 10 - 5 M and 50 s- 1, respectively. The <b>angiotensin</b> I <b>converting</b> activity of human skin chymotryptic proteinase is equal to or greater than the peptidyl dicarboxypeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme.

Each antiserum gave a precipitin line against its respective immunogen without evidence of cross-reactivity against the other enzymes. Human skin chymotryptic proteinase, cathepsin G, and tonin provide unique pathways for the generation of angiotensin II in tissue and may be of significance in regulation of biologic processes of the tissue microenvironment.

Recently, molecular genetic analysis revealed the existence of healthy carriers and that as many as a quarter of genetically affected individuals do not express the disease. This data prompted us to re-investigate the role of the <b>angiotensin</b> I <b>converting</b> enzyme polymorphism on hypertrophy by assessing both clinically affected individuals and healthy carriers. For this, several families with mutations in the cardiac myosin binding protein C or the β-myosin heavy chain genes were analysed. The mean maximal intraventricular septum thickness was compared as a function of <b>angiotensin</b> I <b>converting</b> enzyme genotypes in all genetically affected individuals (n = 114), and in subsets of subjects carrying either a splice acceptor site mutation in the cardiac myosin binding protein C gene (n = 33), or various missense mutations in the cardiac β-myosin heavy chain gene (n = 81) or finally, mutations in the Arg 403 codon of the β-myosin heavy chain gene (n = 54). Significant association between the D allele and hypertrophy was observed only in the case of Arg 403 codon mutations (mean septum thickness for subjects with the DD genotype: 19. 3 ± 2. 7 mm; with the ID genotype: 13. 4 ± 1. 3 mm and with the II genotype: 11. 0 ± 0. 9 mm; P < 0. 02).

While working on this subject, he discovered a family of peptides present in the venom of a Brazilian snake, Bothrops jararaca, which inhibited kininase activity and strongly potentiated the effects of bradykinin in vivo and in vitro.

In 1968, with the collaboration of Dr. Lewis Joel Greene, from the Brookhaven National Laboratory, U.S., he isolated several pharmacologically active peptides responsible for the activity of BPF.
