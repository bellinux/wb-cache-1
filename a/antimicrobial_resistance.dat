25|$|Small {{amounts of}} food is usually {{introduced}} {{as soon as}} possible after surgery, usually within 18–36 hours, to encourage motility and reduce the risk of ileus and the formation of adhesions. Often horses are stall rested with short bouts of hand walking to encourage intestinal motility. The incision site is carefully monitored for dehiscence, or complete failure of the incision leading to spillage of the abdominal contents out of the incision site, and the horse is not allowed turn-out until the incision has healed, usually after 30 days of stall rest. Abdominal bandages are sometimes used to help prevent the risk of dehiscence. Incisional infection doubles the time required for postoperative care, and dehiscence may lead to intestinal herniation, which reduces the likelihood of return to athletic function. Therefore, antibiotics are given 2–3 days after surgery, and temperature is constantly monitored, to help assess if an infection is present. Antibiotics are not used long-term due to the risk of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>resistance.</b> The incision usually takes 6 months to reach 80% strength, while intestinal healing following resection and anastomosis is much faster, at a rate to 100% strength in 3 weeks. After the incision has healed adequately, the horse is turned out in a small area for another 2–3 months, and light exercise is added to improve the tone and strength of the abdominal musculature.|$|E

40|$|To {{increase}} {{understanding of}} drug-resistant Vibrio cholerae, we studied selected molecular mechanisms of <b>antimicrobial</b> drug <b>resistance</b> in the 2010 Haiti V. cholerae outbreak strain. Most resistance resulted from acquired genes located on an integrating conjugative element showing high homology to an integrating conjugative element identifi ed in a V. cholerae isolate from India. Vibrio cholerae is the bacterium that causes cholera, a disease characterized by acute watery diarrhea, vomiting, muscle cramps, and severe dehydration (1). The bacterium has many serogroups, but only toxin-producing serogroups O 1 and O 139 cause epidemic cholera. The primary treatment for cholera is rehydration with oral or intravenous fluids (2). For severe cases, antimicrobial agents {{may reduce the}} volume and duration of diarrhea (1, 2).
