5|$|A few adult beetles may {{overlap between}} {{the spring and}} summer populations, but most adults from the earlier {{emergence}} die before the end of summer. Both adult and larval tansy beetles are unble to detect their host plant, or each other, at a distance, either by smell, sight or a combination of the two. Starvation is thus likely to be <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> <b>to</b> mortality when beetles wander away from their host and become lost.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> <b>to</b> the {{sedimentation}} of the Little Applegate River is McDonald Ditch, an {{irrigation ditch}} near McDonald Creek. Built in 1920 to provide water to residents of nearby Wagner Creek, the ditch has failed numerous times, sending several tons {{of dirt and}} mud downstream. The Talent Irrigation District approved purchasing a $10,000 monitoring system for the ditch in September 2010, and applied for a $100,000 United States Bureau of Reclamation grant to replace the ditch with pipes.|$|E

5|$|The exhaust can {{be transported}} to the Arctic region in little over a day, {{although}} the exact mechanism of this very high-speed transport is unknown. As the water migrates northward, it falls from the thermosphere down into the colder mesosphere, which occupies {{the region of the}} atmosphere just below. Although this mechanism is the cause of individual noctilucent clouds, it is not thought to be <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> <b>to</b> the phenomenon as a whole.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} exponent of the revival was Dundee-born John Duncan (1866–1945), {{who was also}} influenced by Italian Renaissance art and French Symbolism. Among his most influential works are his paintings of Celtic subjects Tristan and Iseult (1912) and St Bride (1913).

5|$|The outflow {{from the}} works, which passes under the River Don Navigation and joins the river beside Jordans weir, {{has in the}} past been <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> <b>to</b> the {{pollution}} of the River Don, but some £70 million has been invested in upgrading the plant, to ensure that discharges to the river meet the requirements of the Freshwater Fish Directive. In dry weather, the outfall discharges 30 million gallons (136,000m3) of treated water each day, more than doubling the flow in the river at this point.|$|E
40|$|Sediment, pesticide, and {{nutrient}} runoff from agricultural non-point sources are <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>contributors</b> <b>to</b> water quality {{degradation of the}} Weeks Bay watershed in Baldwin County, Alabama. Modifications of conventional agricultural practices can yield positive water quality results. Surface sprinkler irrigation runoff is a primary culprit, carrying agricultural pollutants into waterways. An alternative would be to use sub-surface drip irrigation. To successfully facilitate the adoption of existing conservation practices and encourage the innovation of new agricultural methods, farmer attitudes and risk perceptions must be thoroughly understood. Farmers must {{have the ability to}} make management decisions while working collaboratively with policy makers. Research demonstrates that non-regulatory, incentive-based conservation policies are favored by farmers and yield greater levels of adoption (1) ...|$|R

5|$|The team {{created new}} engines {{to satisfy their}} needs for the game. The {{artificial}} intelligence was created to coordinate with players; the addition of Ellie as artificial intelligence was <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> <b>to</b> the engine. The lighting engine was also re-created to incorporate soft light, in which the sunlight seeps in through spaces and reflects off surfaces. The gameplay introduced difficulty to the team, as they felt that every mechanic required thorough analysis. The game's user interface design also underwent various iterations throughout development.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{personal}} taxes in Nauru. The {{unemployment rate is}} estimated to be 90%, and of those who have jobs, the government employs 95%. The Asian Development Bank notes that, although the administration has a strong public mandate to implement economic reforms, {{in the absence of an}} alternative to phosphate mining, the medium-term outlook is for continued dependence on external assistance. Tourism is not <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> <b>to</b> the economy.|$|E

5|$|Two major {{protactinium}} isotopes, 231Pa and 233Pa, {{are produced}} from thorium in nuclear reactors; both are undesirable {{and are usually}} removed, thereby adding complexity to the reactor design and operation. In particular, 232Th via (n,2n) reactions produces 231Th which quickly (half-life 25.5 hours) decays to 231Pa. The last isotope, while not a transuranic waste, has a long half-life of 32,760 years and is <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>contributor</b> <b>to</b> the long term radiotoxicity of spent nuclear fuel.|$|E
