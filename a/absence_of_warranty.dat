50|$|By contrast, a {{warranty}} is not {{fundamental to}} the performance of the contract and breach <b>of</b> a <b>warranty,</b> while giving rise to a claim for damages, does not entitle the non-breaching party to terminate the contract. The meaning of these terms is reversed in insurance law.

40|$|Consumer product {{warranties}} are {{our most}} common of written contracts, but {{little is known}} about what determines their content or how they relate to the reliability and the durability of goods. Since the first appearance <b>of</b> standardized <b>warranties</b> early in this century, two theories have been proposed to explain their role in sales transactions. The first emphasizes the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> bargaining over <b>warranty</b> provisions. It views <b>warranties</b> as devices <b>of</b> manufacturers to exploit consumers by unilaterally limiting legal obligations. The second and more recent theory focuses on the difficulty consumers face at the time of purchase in estimating the risk of product defects. This theory regards express warranties as messages signaling the mechanical attributes of goods. Both theories have influenced substantially judicial and legislative responses to product <b>warranties.</b> The view <b>of</b> the <b>warranty</b> as an exploitative device has provided crucial support to the policy of enterprise liability and the replacement of contract principles with tort principles in product defect cases. In addition, the exploitation theory is the intellectual basis for the modern judicial treatment <b>of</b> consumer <b>warranty</b> issues, in particular for the expansive interpretation <b>of</b> <b>warranties</b> implied by law, for the elimination of the requirement of privity of contract, and for the restriction of the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s authority to limit available remedies or to disclaim general obligations. More recently, the signal theory has informed the design of the federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, which directly regulates both the form and content <b>of</b> consumer product <b>warranties...</b>|$|R

40|$|Warranty is an {{important}} element of marketing new products. The servicing <b>of</b> <b>warranty</b> results in additional costs to the manufacturer. Warranty logistics deals with various issues relating to the servicing <b>of</b> <b>warranty.</b> Proper management <b>of</b> <b>warranty</b> logistics is needed not only to reduce the warranty servicing cost but also to ensure customer satisfaction as customer dissatisfaction has a negative impact on sales and revenue. Unfortunately, warranty logistics has received very little attention. The paper links the literature on warranty and on logistics and then discusses the different issues in warranty logistics.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} two types of risks, the risk of {{malfunctioning}} of a product quantified by its reliability, {{and the risk of}} misunderstanding the features and qualities of a product while deciding whether to buy it. The later risk is caused by the information asymmetry, which is a natural property of any communication process. We discuss the relationship between these risks and product warranty. We begin with an overview <b>of</b> <b>warranties</b> from the decision-makers' viewpoint. We elaborate on the purposes, legalities, and types <b>of</b> <b>warranties</b> and follow with a summary of mathematical models and concepts for quantifying the financial implications <b>of</b> <b>warranties</b> <b>of</b> malfunctioning. Further, we propose a model for quantifying the risk of misinforming and elaborate on the relationship between this risk and product warranty. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{quantify}} the economic value <b>of</b> hardware base <b>warranties</b> in the U. S. server market to manufacturers, channel intermediaries, and customers. We further decompose the value <b>of</b> a <b>warranty</b> into its insurance value and its price discrimination value, {{which are the}} two main rationales for warranty provision in the server market. We use structural modeling and counterfactual experiments to accomplish the empirical task. We derive our demand model from utility maximization, which accounts for a customer's risk aversion behavior and heterogeneity. We obtain our pricing model from the profit maximization behavior of manufacturers and downstream firms in indirect channels, accounting for the institutional realities in the server market. Our empirical analysis uses quarterly data from 1999 to 2004 on server wholesale prices, retail prices, and sales for direct and indirect channels in the U. S. market. We find that manufacturers and downstream firms benefit from warranty provision and from sorting across heterogeneous customers by offering a menu <b>of</b> <b>warranties.</b> Customers also benefit from manufacturer warranty provision {{as well as from}} the menu <b>of</b> <b>warranties</b> offered.
