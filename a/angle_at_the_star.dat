40|$|Observations {{have been}} {{conducted}} of Herbig-Haro objects 1 and 2 with high spectral and spatial resolution {{in order to test}} shock models for the line emission. A detailed bow shock model has been constructed which yields line widths and optical and UV spectra in reasonable agreement with observation for maximum shock velocities approximately 200 km/s. Such velocities are comparable to the transverse velocities of the knots in HH 1 and 2 inferred from proper motion studies. The observations suggest that HH objects are rapidly moving, dense clouds shocking with less dense interstellar medium. The large energy requirements of these objects, combined with their small apparent size as seen from the exciting star, seem to require unreasonably large stellar mass loss rates. However, {{it is possible that the}} HH objects subtended a much larger solid <b>angle</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> when originally accelerated...|$|E
40|$|Spitzer/IRS spectra from 5 to 37 um for a {{complete}} sample of 31 R Coronae Borealis stars (RCBs) are presented. These spectra are combined with optical and near-infrared photometry of each RCB at maximum light to compile a spectral energy distribution (SED). The SEDs are fitted with blackbody flux distributions and estimates made of {{the ratio of the}} infrared flux from circumstellar dust to the flux emitted by the star. Comparisons for 29 of the 31 stars are made with the IRAS fluxes from three decades earlier: Spitzer and IRAS fluxes at 12 um and 25 um are essentially equal for all but a minority of the sample. For this minority, the IRAS to Spitzer flux ratio exceeds a factor of three. The outliers are suggested to be stars where formation of a dust cloud or dust puff is a rare event. A single puff ejected prior to the IRAS observations may have been reobserved by Spitzer as a cooler puff at a greater distance from the RCB. RCBs which experience more frequent optical declines have, in general, a circumstellar environment containing puffs subtending a larger solid <b>angle</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> and a quasi-constant infrared flux. Yet, the estimated subtended solid angles and the blackbody temperatures of the dust show a systematic evolution to lower solid angles and cooler temperatures in the interval between IRAS and Spitzer. Dust emission by these RCBs and those in the LMC is similar in terms of total 24 um luminosity and [8. 0]-[24. 0] color index.
