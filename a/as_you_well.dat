25|$|In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had {{the real}} great {{training}}, {{maybe even the}} last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> know, is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it {{is a sort of}} a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, {{whether you like it or}} not. You have to learn to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.|$|E

Maçek III, Cult guitarist Billy Duffy {{spoke of the}} band's playlist while on tour, saying [...] "Obviously {{you want to make}} an impactful ," [...] he continues. [...] "There are some practical, pragmatic decisions made. If you’re playing to a crowd who are not very familiar with you, there's no point of going too deep but we do always make sure we play a new song. Like on Guns N' Roses [...] we had fifty minutes which is ten songs all in. So, you know we just made sure that in those ten songs we played 'Deeply Ordered Chaos' which we’re proud of and it makes a certain statement. And it just alerts people to the fact that, yes, we have made a record in the last 30 years. You know and that’s a good thing. Psychologically, that's the blood transfusion that we need. And we're very mindful, we have a very loyal fan base. We don’t pander <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> know." ...|$|E

60|$|Now this, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> may <b>well</b> conceive, {{provoked}} {{a discussion about}} the board, in which all joined, not excepting Fifanti's lady and Donna Leocadia.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is {{there any}} sense," [...] she demanded, [...] "in {{being in love}} with a person who, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> {{perfectly}} <b>well</b> know, thoroughly dislikes and detests you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] she remonstrated, [...] "no girl {{can afford}} to throw away such chances, even if she is, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are, <b>well</b> endowed, pretty, and clever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your mother, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> know, my dear Derby, {{would be}} delighted, {{did you take}} any {{interest}} {{in the affairs of}} the island." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The prince rarely {{gives an}} opinion," [...] said the baron. [...] "Indeed, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> know, he rarely speaks; he thinks and he acts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{mean you}} by hints so dark, and a {{question}} so sudden? The chaplain, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> know, is absent at Perth upon an {{assembly of the}} brethren." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You poor fool!" [...] he said; [...] "leave {{it alone}} can't you? You want to poison {{yourself}} I know. <b>Well,</b> <b>you</b> can do <b>as</b> <b>you</b> jolly <b>well</b> like when <b>you</b> {{are out of}} this--not before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will have}} no threats; <b>you</b> are powerless, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> very <b>well</b> know. Let things remain as they are or, by God! you shall both suffer for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's my brother, and {{of course}} I'm obliged to think of him. And if you please, I'll go home <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are <b>well</b> enough to spare me." ...|$|R
6000|$|To show one's tongue, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> know, [...] Is not {{considered}} nice to do; [...] But {{if it were}} like Mr. Toad's [...] I'd want to show it--wouldn't you? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{should all}} of us grieve, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> may believe, [...] If you never were met with again-- [...] But surely, my man, when the voyage began, [...] You might have {{suggested}} it then? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't {{your health}} I mean. There are other things, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> know. You do your day's {{work and you}} take your pleasure, and you go through both as if your feet were on a treadmill." ...|$|E
60|$|Rose. My lady, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> may <b>well</b> imagine, is most {{extremely}} incensed against Sir Martin; but she applauds your ingenuity to the skies. I'll say no more, but thereby hangs a tale.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am no skilled electrician, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> very <b>well</b> know. My {{calling you}} {{here was an}} accident. So I don't know how to command you, nor what {{to ask you to}} do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Alaric, if it {{be about}} money {{tell me the}} worst, and I'll bear it without a murmur. As long <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are <b>well</b> I care for nothing else--have you given up your place?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That, unfortunately," [...] de Grost declared, with {{a little}} sigh, [...] "is, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> know, out of the question. You are too clever for me, Bernadine. After all, I shall {{have to go back}} to my farm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I intend no rebuke, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> know. What I mean is this; {{if you do}} {{not stay}} in Yorkshire till you are married, let the time be when it may, where do you intend to go in the meantime?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, Patricia; {{you shall}} have your way. My only desire, child, is to please you, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> know, {{and if you}} long to see Kenneth the owner of Elmhurst I {{will have a new}} will drawn in his favor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{an honest}} man," [...] said Fletcher, [...] "and to raise {{sufficient}} {{money to make}} your defalcations good will {{not by any means}} leave me the gainer, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> very <b>well</b> know." ...|$|R
60|$|GERALD. I {{suppose you}} think him bad, because he doesn't believe {{the same things}} <b>as</b> <b>you</b> do. <b>Well,</b> men are {{different}} from women, mother. It is natural {{that they should have}} different views.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here!" [...] said McMurdo sternly. [...] "It {{was only}} last night, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> know <b>well,</b> that I swore good faith to our Bodymaster. Would you be {{asking me to}} break my oath?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am happier in the woods, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> know, {{and was on}} my way thither but now, when I {{paused at}} the sight of all these troopers {{flocking}} in to Evesham. What enterprise has Sir Walter on hand now, think you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied he, {{with sudden}} consciousness, [...] "not {{to find it}} in YOU; for I cannot be ignorant that to you, to your goodness, I owe it all.--I feel it--I would express it if I could--but, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> know, I am no orator." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'May you! Can you ask it?... As for me, I {{shall have}} no {{pleasure}} to be begrudged or otherwise. The only pleasure I have is, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> know, in you. When you are with me, I am happy: when you are away, I take no pleasure in anything.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You may jaw,' said Bradshaw at last, 'as much <b>as</b> <b>you</b> jolly <b>well</b> please, but I'm {{not going}} to give this away. All you're going to know is that I shan't be there tomorrow.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{art thou}} a woman, as thou dost declare, Whose valor hath proved so undaunted in warre? If England doth yield such brave maydens <b>as</b> <b>thee,</b> Full <b>well</b> mey they conquer, faire Mary Ambree." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgiven!" [...] {{repeated}} Magdalen. [...] "If {{other women}} wanted as little forgiving <b>as</b> <b>you</b> do--Well! <b>well!</b> Suppose <b>you</b> open {{some of these}} parcels. Come! I {{want to see what}} you have been buying to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, dear lady, that is {{not soon}} done! You and Mistress Anne, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> know, first awoke me from my firm belief that I {{was none other than}} an elf, and yet there have since been times when I have doubted whether it were not indeed the truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From {{the very}} {{circumstance}} of its being larger, sir. We shall have no occasion {{to open the}} windows at all--not once the whole evening; {{and it is that}} dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air upon heated bodies, which (<b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> know, sir) does the mischief." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pardon me, sir; you {{are giving}} a very wrong {{construction}} to my language, if you suppose I include, without many and particular qualifications, the bibulus Americanus, {{in the family}} of the vacca. For, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>well</b> know, sir--or, as I presume I should say, Doctor; you have the medical diploma, no doubt?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course he}} did," [...] said his wife. [...] "Who has such claims <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have? <b>Well,</b> {{now we must}} hope and watch. Look cheerful to the children, for they have been very anxious." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't want my days to be long, if we're {{never to}} come to an understanding," [...] she answered. [...] "And I've got no mother, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> know <b>well,</b> or <b>you</b> wouldn't treat me so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course not. No {{power on}} earth would have bribed you to do it, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> know <b>well</b> enough. I don't mind the first night, but we are too old {{for that sort of}} thing now." ...|$|R
