40|$|The {{effects of}} thyroidectomy and thyroid hormone {{replacement}} on the mass and in situ molar activity <b>of</b> tyrosine hydroxylase (<b>TH)</b> in the median eminence (ME) and superior cervical ganglia (SCG) of male rats were investigated. The tissue specificity of these effects {{were evaluated by}} comparing the ME with the superior cervical ganglion (SCG). All animals were thyroparathyroidectomized (Tx) or sham Tx. Tx rats were treated daily for 3 weeks with 0. 15 M NaCl (solvent vehicle) or L-thyroxine (T 4). Two doses of T 4, 10 and 100 micrograms/day/kg BW, were used. Sham Tx rats were treated with 0. 15 M NaCl. All animals were studied on the day following the last treatment. The mass <b>of</b> <b>TH</b> was determined using an immunoblot assay, and the in situ activity <b>of</b> <b>TH</b> was calculated from the rate of intracellular accumulation of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) after administration of an inhibitor of DOPA decarboxylase activity. In the ME, thyro-parathyroidectomy resulted in a 40 % increase in the mass and a 100 % increase in the in situ molar activity <b>of</b> <b>TH</b> over that <b>of</b> sham Tx rats. Compared to Tx animals given 0. 15 M NaCl, Tx rats treated with a low dose of T 4 (10 micrograms/day/kg BW) had <b>a</b> reduced <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>TH</b> in the ME, but the molar activity of the enzyme was increased. Treatment of Tx rats with a high dose of T 4 (100 micrograms/day/kg BW) restored TH mass but not the in situ activity <b>of</b> <b>TH</b> in the ME to the level seen in sham Tx rats.

40|$|Aims and objectives: Characterization of {{proteins}} {{associated with the}} mycobacterial cell wall is critical to understanding bacterial survival and immune modulation in the host. A variety of mycobacterial products are able to recognize and activate mammalian toll-like receptors (TLRs) mediating the secretion of antibacterial effector molecules. Mycobacterium tuberculosis MymA Rv 3083 protein is a cell wall-associated protein which is up-regulated upon infection of macrophages. The objective {{of the present study}} is to understand the role of Rv 3083 protein as a TLR agonist and its contribution in activating macrophages. Methods: The MymA (Rv 3083) gene was cloned and expressed. The purified 55. 5 kDa recombinant protein was used to stimulate phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) differentiated THP- 1 macrophage cell line. Cell surface markers of Rv 3083 stimulated THP- 1 cells were done using flow cytometry for TLR 2, TLR 4, HLA-DR and co-stimulatory molecules CD 40, CD 64 and CD 80. Cytokines TNF-α, IL- 10 and IL- 12 were assayed in the culture supernatant using ELISA. Results: Stimulation of THP- 1 macrophages for 48 and 72 h with rRv 3083 protein resulted in significantly increased expression of TLR 2. A significant up-regulation was also seen in the expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD 40, CD 80 and antigen-presenting molecule HLA-DR on THP- 1 cells. These macrophages also produced <b>a</b> significant <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> proinflammatory <b>TH</b> 1 cytokines TNF-α and IL- 12, but not IL- 10 at 48 and 72 h post-stimulation. Conclusion: The cell wall-associated M. tuberculosis rRv 3083 protein acts as an agonist of TLR 2 and thereby activates macrophages to produce a TH 1 immune response.
