He studied abroad under a pseudonym, his identity being known only to a select few including university officials and security agencies. After obtaining degrees in international relations and development studies at the universities of Rollins and Cambridge, Gandhi worked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Monitor</b> Group, a management consulting firm in London, before establishing the Mumbai-based technology outsourcing firm, Backops Services Private Ltd. In 2004, Gandhi re-entered public life {{when he ran for}} and won his father's old Lok Sabha (lower house of Indian Parliament) seat of Amethi, Uttar Pradesh. A few years later, in 2007, Gandhi was elected as the General Secretary of the Congress party, an executive post also held in the past by his father, Rajiv Gandhi and by his great-grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru. Amidst calls from Congress party veterans for his greater involvement in party politics and national government, Gandhi was elected Congress Vice-President in 2013.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1863, {{frequent}} {{design changes}} were causing growing problems for the contractors. Stimers {{and his team of}} thirty draftsmen <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>monitor</b> office continued to submit changes even as the vessels {{were in the process of}} production, leading to long delays. One yard in Boston received a total of 83 drawings and 120 letters of explanation from Stimers, and the specification manual for the ships grew to 92 pages of small print. The final design called for a total of thirteen auxiliary engines and pumps per ship, fancy brasswork in place of cast iron, and a complex system of pipes for draining and filling the water tanks. The added weight to a ship designed with only a [...] freeboard at the outset raised questions about the ships' eventual seaworthiness.|$|E
2500|$|Gandhi {{attended}} St. Columba's School, Delhi {{before entering}} The Doon School in Dehradun, Uttarakhand from 1981 to 1983. Meanwhile, {{his father had}} joined politics and became the Prime Minister on 31 October 1984 when Indira Gandhi was assassinated. Due to the security threats faced by Indira Gandhi's family from Sikh extremists, Rahul Gandhi and his sister, Priyanka were home-schooled thereafter. Rahul Gandhi joined St. Stephen's College, Delhi in 1989 for his undergraduate education but moved to Harvard University after he completed the first year examinations. In 1991, after Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by the Tamil Tigers (LTTE) during an election rally, he shifted to Rollins College in [...] Florida, USA, [...] due to security concerns and obtained his B.A. in 1994. During his time at Rollins, he assumed the pseudonym Raul Vinci and his identity was known only to the university officials and security agencies. He further went on to obtain an M.Phil from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1995. After graduation, Rahul Gandhi worked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Monitor</b> Group, a management consulting firm, in London. In 2002, {{he was one of}} the directors of Mumbai-based technology outsourcing firm Backops Services Private Ltd. While in 2004, Gandhi had told the press that he had a Spanish girlfriend, an architect, living in Venezuela, whom he had met while studying in England., in 2013 he suggested that he may not get married.|$|E

30|$|The {{tests were}} {{carried out in the}} {{following}} sequence: (1) the numerical flow and transport models were used to estimate <b>the</b> TFs <b>at</b> each <b>monitoring</b> points by using the SIF procedure; (2) the numerical models were used to compute <b>the</b> concentrations <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>monitoring</b> points due to the release function described by Eq. (22); (3) <b>the</b> observations collected <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>monitoring</b> points were used in the inverse procedure aimed <b>at</b> recovering <b>the</b> release history <b>at</b> <b>the</b> source location.|$|R
30|$|The {{results of}} the procedure, using a Gaussian {{function}} as expected value (Fig.  5 a), are very satisfactory. The recovered release history {{is very similar to}} the true one. Moreover, <b>the</b> concentrations estimated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>monitoring</b> point (due to the recovered release history) are very close to the one observed (Fig.  4). The maximum nRMSE computed between the recovered and true release history results 2.20  % (see Table  1), while the one maximum computed between the estimated and observed concentration <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>monitoring</b> points is 1.52  %. Considering a Boxcar function as expected value (Fig.  5 b), the estimated release history is even better than the previous one; that is confirmed by the nRMSE computed, in the worst case, between the recovered and true release history in 1.34  % (see Table  1), while the one computed between the estimated and observed concentration <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>monitoring</b> points is 1.16  %.|$|R

Consequently she inflicted no damage on the Monitor, and the action continued, the turret ship directing her fire at the iron roof of the ram, while the latter pointed her guns especially at the turret and pilot-house of the Monitor. At length, after a battle which had lasted six hours, the Monitor withdrew, one of the plates of her pilot house being seriously damaged and her commander injured in the eyes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMaterial {{models are}} the key {{ingredients}} to accurately capture the global mechanical response of structural systems. The use of finite element analysis {{has proven to be}} effective in simulating nonlinear engineering applications. However, the choice of the appropriate material model plays a big role {{in the value of the}} numerical predictions. Such models are not expected to exactly reproduce global experimental response in all cases. Alternatively, the measured global response at specific domain or surface points can be used to guide the nonlinear analysis to successively extract a representative material model. By selecting an initial set of stress–strain data points, <b>the</b> load–displacement response <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>monitoring</b> points is computed in a forward incremental analysis without iterations. This analysis retains <b>the</b> stresses <b>at</b> <b>the</b> integration points. The corresponding strains are not accurate since the computed displacements are not anticipated to match <b>the</b> measured displacements <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>monitoring</b> points. Therefore, a corrective incremental displacement analysis is performed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same load steps to adjust for displacements and strains everywhere by matching <b>the</b> measured displacements <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>monitoring</b> points. <b>The</b> stress–strain vectors <b>at</b> <b>the</b> most highly stressed integration point are found to establish an improved material model. This model is used within a multi-pass incremental nonlinear finite element analysis until the discrepancy between the measured and the predicted structural response <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>monitoring</b> points vanishes. <b>The</b> J 2 flow theory of plasticity is used as a constitutive framework to build the tangent elastic–plastic matrices. The applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated by solving 2 D inverse continuum problems. The comparisons presented support the effectiveness of the proposed approach in accurately calibrating the J 2 plasticity material model for such problems...|$|R

40|$|The active foliar area (AFA) {{is a key}} {{parameter}} in banana crop models, {{but it is hard}} {{to evaluate}} andexisting in vivo assessment models are unreliable. We studied the leaf area dynamics in 405 plantainsbelonging to nine varieties (Batard, Big Ebanga, CRBP 39, D 248, D 535, Essong, FHIA 21, French clair andMbouroukou n? 3) throughout one crop cycle. An analysis of the structure of 8858 monitored leaf con-figurations (i. e. each defined by a variety, a number of living leaves and a banana development stage atthe <b>monitoring</b> time) revealed <b>the</b> leaf area dynamics versus banana development phases. This analysisalso confirmed the relevance of a linear leaf area (LA) increase model. Two ANOVAs were performed toassess the sensitivity of the linear AFA simulation model regarding the variety, number of living leavesand banana development stage <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>monitoring</b> time. Finally, we propose a new banana AFA simulationmodel based on a combination of two linear models. The OTO (for 'leaves One, Three, One') model onlyinvolves two input parameters: the number of living leaves <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>monitoring</b> time and <b>the</b> length andwidth of three of these living leaves. The model validation confirmed its independence from <b>the</b> variety,banana configuration <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>monitoring</b> time, and cropping conditions.

Implications of differences between modelled and observed inputs for ozone flux calculations for wheat and potato were investigated. The EMEP model output of ozone, temperature and VPD correlated well with measurements during daytime. Deviations were larger during the night, especially in calm conditions, attributed to local climatological conditions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>monitoring</b> site deviating from average conditions of the grid.
