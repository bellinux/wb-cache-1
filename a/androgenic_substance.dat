40|$|The {{functional}} {{significance of}} the testis has been known {{since the time of}} Aristotle (121) who ascribed post-pubertal changes to the function of the gonads, as such manifestations were absent in castrates — both in man and in birds. Accurate knowledge of the nature and metabolism of the androgenically active substance secreted by the testis has, however, been acquired only during the past decade. It was not until {{the first half of the}} Nineteenth Century that the gonads were recognized as being ductless glands, and capable of secreting a substance into the blood-stream. That the testis is normally the main source of the <b>androgenic</b> <b>substance</b> in man and other animals was first indicated experimentally by Berthold in 1849 (4). He removed the testis of four roosters and replaced one testis in an unusual abdominal position in each of two capons. He killed these two capons six months later and found that because of the testicular grafts, “these animals remained male in regard to voice, reproduction, instinct, fighting spirits, and growth of comb and wattles”. Berthold further suggested that the testicle exerted its influence upon the organism via the blood, and this viewpoint is now the generally accepted one. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|Worldwide, {{wild fish}} living in rivers {{receiving}} municipal and industrial discharges may experience endocrine disruption {{as a result}} of exposure to anthropogenic pollutants. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the hormonal status of wild fish in a U. S. river receiving unbleached kraft and recycled pulp mill effluent (Pearl River at Bogalusa, LA). We evaluated two alternative hypotheses: the effluent contained constituents that suppressed male and female reproduction, or it contained an <b>androgenic</b> <b>substance</b> that masculinized females. To evaluate the likelihood of fish exposure to effluent, we marked 697 longear sunfish (Lepomis megalotis) over a 2 -year period; 83 % of recaptured fish were found at the site of initial capture, and only one fish migrated from an effluent-receiving site to a reference site. We can reasonably assume that fish captured from an effluent-receiving site are residents, not transitory migrants. To diagnose endocrine disruption, we measured sex steroid hormone [17 β-estradiol (E 2), testosterone (T), and 11 -ketotestosterone (11 KT) ] and vitellogenin (VTG) concentrations in male and female longear sunfish captured at two sites upstream and two sites downstream of the effluent outfall. Kraft pulp mill effluent did not affect male reproductive physiology but did suppress female T and VTG levels when effluent constituted ≥ 1 % of river flow. Masculinization was not observed. Longear sunfish in the Pearl River experience moderate reproductive suppression in response to unbleached kraft and recycled pulp mill effluent.

40|$|Numerous {{experimental}} data {{support the idea}} that ovarian tissue in mammals secretes androgenic hormone in addition to the female sex hormones. 2 ' 4 ' 14 Similar observations have been made on the starling," 5 the night heron, 9 and the English sparrow. 8 ' 15 In the case of the sparrow the evidence is based on the observation that the bill of the female darkens appreciably during the breeding season or when the ovary is stimulated to full activity by injections of pregnant mare serum. ' This indicates rather conclusively that male hormone is produced, since androgens are the only known substances which induce deposition of pigment in the sparrow bill. However, {{under the influence of the}} normally activated ovary the female bill does not assume the jet black color which occurs in the presence of a fully activated testis or following the injection of large amounts of androgen. The present experiments were designed, therefore, to determine, first, whether a jet black bill can be produced by overstimulation of the ovary and, second, whether the female sex hormones, even though ineffective when given alone, 7 might either augment the action of the <b>androgenic</b> <b>substance</b> or maintain appreciable quantities of bill pigment once it is laid down. The latter possibility would probably depend on whether growth of the bill is slowed down by estrogen, since loss of pigment is apparently accomplished through growth and wearing off of the bill. ' " Pregnant mare serum was the gonadotropin used in these experiments, not only because it is very effective in stimulating the ovary of the bird but also because it is a substance which will over-activate the ovary if injected in large enough amounts. In such over-stimulated ovaries it might be possible to find evidence concerning the source of the androgen...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{research}} {{has examined the}} endocrine-disrupting action of various environmental pollutants, including hormones, pharmaceuticals, and surfactants, in sewage treatment plant effluent. Responding {{to the growth of}} concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) and the pollutants present in their wastewater (e. g., nutrients, pharmaceuticals, and hormones), the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency developed a new rule that tightens the regulation of CAFOs. In this study, we collected wild fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) exposed to feedlot effluent (FLE) and observed significant alterations in their reproductive biology. Male fish were demasculinized (having lower testicular testosterone synthesis, altered head morphometrics, and smaller testis size). Defeminization of females, as evidenced by a decreased estrogen:androgen ratio of in vitro steroid hormone synthesis, was also documented. We did not observe characteristics in either male or female fish indicative of exposure to environmental estrogens. Using cells transfected with the human androgen receptor, we detected potent androgenic responses from the FLE. Taken together, our morphologic, endocrinologic, and in vitro gene activation assay data suggest two hypotheses: a) there are potent <b>androgenic</b> <b>substance(s)</b> in the FLE, and/or b) there is a complex mixture of <b>androgenic</b> and estrogenic <b>substances</b> that alter the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis, inhibiting the release of gonadotropin-releasin...|$|R

50|$|In the 1930s Callow became {{interested}} in the structure and action of sex hormones and identifying steroids in urine. In a 1936 paper, written with Frank Young, a footnote states “The term steroids is proposed as generic name for the group of compounds comprising the sterols, bile acids, heart poisons, saponins and sex hormones.” Callow claimed that this was the first use of the term “steroids”. He showed that androgens were excreted in the urine in similar amounts in men, women and eunuchs, which at the time was surprising. His conclusion was that these substances were produced by the adrenal cortex {{as well as by the}} gonads. This conclusion was supported by findings made jointly with A.C. Crooke, working at the London Hospital, that patients with Cushing’s syndrome, caused by a tumour of the adrenals, had very high levels of <b>androgenic</b> <b>substances</b> in the urine.|$|R

40|$|Androgens’ {{metabolism}} and activity are gaining a {{more and more}} important role in human physiology particularly referring to aging and to neurodegenerative diseases. Androgen treatment is often required for long-lasting disorders. In order to improve their duration and effects, androgens can be administered as esters of carboxylic acids. The novelty of our research {{is the use of}} esters of androgens with specific unsaturated fatty acids, in order to reduce possible side effects particularly related to chronic pathologies with altered lipid homeostasis such as X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy and cardiovascular disorders. Thus the esters of the main <b>androgenic</b> <b>substances</b> testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and their metabolite 5 alpha-androstan- 3 alpha, 17 beta-diol were chemically obtained by coupling with different unsaturated fatty acids. To this aim, fatty acids with various degree of unsaturation and belonging to different series were selected. Specifically, oleic acid (18 : 1, n- 9), linoleic acid (18 : 2, n- 6), and the n- 3 fatty acids, alpha-linolenic acid (18 : 3), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20 : 5), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22 : 6) were used obtaining corresponding esters with acceptable yields and good degree of purity. All the synthesized compounds were tested for their cytotoxic activities in mouse NIH 3 T 3 and human astrocyte cell lines. The esters demonstrated good tolerability and no in vitro cytotoxic effect in both cell cultures. After these promising preliminary results, the esters will be suitable for in vivo studies in order to ascertain their pharmacokinetic characteristics and their biological effects...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Spiggin is an {{adhesive}} glycoprotein {{produced in}} the kidney of sticklebacks during the breeding season and is subsequently secreted into the urinary bladder from where it is employed for nest building. Since {{the production of the}} protein {{has been shown to be}} under androgenic control, spiggin has been suggested to be a useful biomarker for <b>androgenic</b> <b>substances</b> in the environment. In this study, two polyclonal spiggin antibodies based on synthetic peptides and one polyclonal antibody directed against native spiggin have been characterized. The antibodies ability to identify spiggin was investigated by quantitative immunoassay. For both peptide antibodies the quantification range was determined to be between 1 and 80 ng spiggin and determination of renal spiggin levels from immature and mature males displayed a 15 -fold increase in total spiggin content of the kidney resulting in a 6 -fold increase in male kidney weight due to hypertrophy. The kidney somatic index (KSI) was found to correlate well with the total renal spiggin content and therefore it appears that KSI in sticklebacks could be used as an initial method to identify <b>substances</b> displaying <b>androgenic</b> effects. Furthermore, western blot analysis revealed that the polyclonal antibodies recognize different spiggin isoforms and that spiggin can be detected in the urinary bladder and kidney of both males and female sticklebacks. In order to develop a quantitative detection method for native spiggin it is necessary to produce a standard that can be used in a bioassay. Due to the adhesive and polymerization characteristics of spiggin the protein is difficult to use as a standard in bioassays. So far spiggin has been shown to exist in at least 14 isoforms, all of which contain polymerization domains. To overcome the solubility problem we have produced recombinant spiggin gamma, with only one polymerization domain, that can be expressed in E. coli. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the polyclonal antibodies were able to detect recombinant spiggin gamma protein in bacterial cell lysate, suggesting that it may be developed into a useful source of standard spiggin to be used for quantitative determination of androgen induced spiggin production in sticklebacks. </p...|$|R
40|$|It is {{difficult}} to speak with scientific restraint of the contributions of Edgar Allen to mankind. It is perhaps {{enough to say that}} here in New Haven the important school of anatomists, which knew his influence, thrives with vigor, and that his work has profoundly influenced biology universally, as will be apparent later in this lecture. Sexual maturity, in addition to conferring certain biological rights and privileges, entails an increased susceptibility to neoplasms. If any proof is needed, consider cancer of the breast which is exdusively a disease of adult life where in man more than 99 per cent of the cases occur in females. " 3 The relationship of tumors to the male sex is well recognized also. Gastric cancer is slightly commoner in the male 13 19; among white males the death rate from cancer of the buccal cavity was seven times that for white females, 13 while cancers of the lung, skin, and urinary bladder occur more than twice as frequently in men as in women. Maleness does not differ from femaleness in hormones alone; the occupation and habits of man enter into the causation of his diseases. There is, however, a well-recognized androgenic hormonal component operative in certain neoplasms. This will be discussed at this time. Beginning with the extraction of an estrogenic agent from the ovaries of the hog 'by Allen and Doisy 2 in 1923 numerous studies have been made of the sex hormones and many <b>androgenic</b> <b>substances</b> as well as estrogens have been isolated in a crystalline state; not only has their chemical constitution 'been determined, but partial or complete synthesis of most of them has been achieved. This work represents one of the greatest triumphs of science. Androgen is a stimulant of growth causing certain areas to increase in cell mass, the response representing the result of a complex interplay of chemical agents acting on end-organs specifically reactive to these forces. The responsive areas are most diversified and growth is strikingly observed, inter alia, in the integument and its appendages, the musde, larynx, and the accessory sex structures.

40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis was aimed at developing an in vitro cell-based reporter gene system applicable to the detection of the illegal use of androgenic growth promoters in cattle, {{and the presence of}} potential endocrine disrupters present in surface waters and interfering with androgenic action. The system is based on a luciferase reporter gene placed under transcriptional control of an authenticated androgen-responsive element (ARE) and an endogenously expressed androgen receptor. This system allows for the integration of the effects of certain modulators of androgenic signal transduction. A second important goal of the research was to gain insight into the mechanisms underlying enhanced growth promotion by mixtures of androgenic and estrogenic compounds. The use of such mixtures, which results in activation and subsequent interaction of multiple steroid receptors, is occasionally observed in illegal hormonal treatments of cattle. When applied to the screening of calf urine samples for anabolic androgens, the developed AR-LUX assay was able to identify androgen-treated animals with similar results as obtained by standard GC-MS analysis. However, both techniques should be regarded as complementary rather than interchangeable screening tools. Liquid samples confiscated at cattle farms outside the Netherlands were found to generate a very strong response in the AR-LUX assay despite the fact that GC-MS analysis did not detect the presence of any anabolic compounds. Possibly, the samples contained a mixture of conventional androgenic compounds, each at undetectably low amounts and/or (novel) unknown compounds not tested for by GC-MS. These results emphasize the additional value of the developed AR-LUX assay. Also, the AR-LUX assay was used to determine the androgenic activity of a number of aquatic environmental samples. A number of these samples were found to contain androgenic activity at varying concentrations. Interestingly, in 2 samples containing androgens, enhancing interactive mixture effects were observed, which were probably due to interactions by estrogenic compounds and estrogen receptor activation. Our research furthermore indicates that certain established progestagens are able to activate ARE-mediated luciferase expression via progesterone receptors; we hypothesise preferentially through the progesterone receptor-α isoform. This indicates that androgen reporter assays based on the activation of the androgen receptor alone rather than on activation of a response element might produce results quite different from those observed in assay systems featuring multiple steroid receptors. This further emphasizes the notion that the AR-LUX assay is not merely detecting activation of the androgen receptor by androgens, but also allows for the detection of other <b>androgenic</b> <b>substances</b> that regulate gene expression via alternative pathways leading to activation of an established androgen response element...|$|R

Discussions about the use of biomolecular tools indicate that gene expression analysis with rotifers should be available in the next few years. Such analyses will be a great asset as they enable ecotoxicologists to study molecular mechanisms of toxicity. Rotifers also appear as useful tools in the risk assessment of pharmaceuticals and their metabolites that find their way into aquatic ecosystems because their sensitivity to some of these substances is higher than that of cladocerans and algae. The nature and extent of the impact of potential endocrine disruptors on aquatic invertebrates is another poorly resolved issue for which rotifers are a promising tool. Indeed, rotifers seem to be particularly sensitive to <b>androgenic</b> and anti-antiandrogenic <b>substances,</b> whereas copepods and cladocerans are typically more affected by estrogens and juvenile hormone-like compounds. Besides their usefulness in these emerging fields of aquatic ecotoxicology, it was emphasized that research with rotifers on basic issues like, e. g., toxicant interference with predation, competition, or interspecific and interclonal variation in ecotoxicological tests is still needed.

40|$|Industrial and {{domestic}} sewage effluents {{have been found}} to cause reproductive disorders in wild fish, often {{as a result of the}} interference of compounds in the effluents with the endocrine system. This thesis describes laboratory-based exposure experiments and a field survey that were conducted with juveniles of the three-spined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus. This small teleost is a common fish in Swedish coastal waters and was chosen as an alternative to non-native test species commonly used in endocrine disruption studies, which allows the comparison of field data with results from laboratory experiments. The aim of this thesis was to elucidate 1) if genetic sex determination and differentiation can be disturbed by natural and synthetic steroid hormones and 2) whether this provides an endpoint for the detection of endocrine disruption, 3) to evaluate the applicability of specific estrogen- and androgen-inducible marker proteins in juvenile three-spined sticklebacks, 4) to investigate whether estrogenic and/or androgenic endocrine disrupting activity can be detected in effluents from Swedish pulp mills {{and domestic}} sewage treatment plants and 5) whether such activity can be detected in coastal waters receiving these effluents. Laboratory exposure experiments found juvenile three-spined sticklebacks to be sensitive to water-borne estrogenic and <b>androgenic</b> steroid <b>substances.</b> Intersex – the co-occurrence of ovarian and testicular tissue in gonads – was induced by 17 β-estradiol (E 2), 17 α-ethinylestradiol (EE 2), 17 α-methyltestosterone (MT) and 5 α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The first two weeks after hatching was the phase of highest sensitivity. MT was ambivalent by simultaneously eliciting masculinizing and feminizing effects. When applying a DNA-based method for genetic sex identification, it was found that application of MT only during the first two weeks after hatching caused total and apparently irreversible development of testis in genetic females. E 2 caused gonad type reversal from male to female. E 2 and EE 2 induced vitellogenin - the estrogen-responsive yolk precursor protein, while DHT and MT induced spiggin – the androgen-responsive glue protein of the stickleback. None of the effluents from two pulp mills and two domestic sewage treatment plants had any estrogenic or androgenic activity. Juvenile three-spined sticklebacks were collected during four subsequent summers at the Swedish Baltic Sea coast in recipients of effluents from pulp mills and a domestic sewage treatment plant as well as remote reference sites. No sings of endocrine disruption were observed at any site, when studying gonad development or marker proteins, except for a deviation of sex ratios at a reference site. The three-spined stickleback – with focus on the juvenile stage – was found to be a sensitive species suitable for the study of estrogenic and androgenic endocrine disruption...|$|R
40|$|The hamster flank organ {{has served}} as a model to study androgen-dependent {{responses}} of the skin, but the quantitative response of hair follicles to androgenic stimulation has been neglected. We assayed the hair follicle response to testosterone (T) and compared it to the response of the sebaceous glands and of the dermal pigment in the Golden Syrian hamster flank organ. Because of biologic variation in male animals and uneven absorption of hormone from parenteral injections, we implanted silastic capsules 0. 25, 0. 5, 1, and 2 cm in length filled with crystalline T sub-cutaneously into female hamsters for 6 weeks. Hair follicle response to T was more sensitive than sebaceous gland or pigment. Diameters of hairs under the sebaceous gland increased significantly from control values of 27. 7 ± 1. 0 p. m to 38. 0 ± 1. 6 μm at the lowest dose of T tested, the 0. 25 -cm capsule (p < 0. 001). There was an increase in the absolute number of hairs under the sebaceous gland as the flank organ enlarged, from 27. 9 ± 9. 9 control to 55. 3 ± 5. 8 with the 2 -cm T capsule. There was no concomitant increase in hair density, 14. 4 ± 3. 5 hairs/mm control vs 12. 5 ± 1. 1 hairs/mm with the 2 -cm capsule. Hair follicles lateral to the sebaceous gland did not show the same response to androgen stimulation. Sebaceous gland and pigmentation responded in a dose-dependent fashion, the maximum effect being achieved with a 1 -cm T capsule. We conclude that T affects hair by specifically stimulating growth of individual hairs physically under the sebaceous gland. As the whole flank organ enlarges more hairs are recruited to become larger but 110 new follicles appear. These studies also confirm that there are different sensitivities to androgen within the various androgen-dependent components of the hamster flank organ, with increase in hair diameter being highly sensitive. This model should be useful for the specific and quantitative assessment of <b>androgenic</b> and antiandrogenic <b>substances</b> on hair growth and ultimately be useful for therapy of hirsutism...|$|R
