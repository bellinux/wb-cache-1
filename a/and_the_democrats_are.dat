5000|$|The Great Depression lingers {{on in the}} U.S. and [...] "Occupied Canada" [...] through 1934 and 1935, with {{millions}} of men {{out of work and}} productivity down. President Herbert Hoover's only highlight during this time is ending the Japanese War but many people continue to question why it was fought in the first place. In the U.S. Congress, Flora Hamburger Blackford questions why Hoover <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>are</b> allowing the Confederate States to enlarge its army in violation of the peace treaty. At the same time, Congress has to deal with several Freedom Party congressmen from the former Confederate states of Kentucky and Houston (formerly part of western Texas), who disrupt Congressional sessions with calls for a plebiscite in their home states. When Socialist Governor of New York, Alfred E. Smith is elected over Hoover in 1936, the Freedom Party's shouts start to be heeded.|$|E

25|$|Following {{a ruling}} by the state's supreme court that a 1% {{property}} tax cap voted into law via initiative was unconstitutional, Gregoire ordered a special session to reinstate the cap. In {{the days leading up}} to the special session Gregoire <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> accused by liberals that they were caving in to Tim Eyman, the person who submitted the property tax initiative, <b>and</b> rushing <b>the</b> legislative process to reinstate the cap but not making other, more meaningful, property tax reform.|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] This past {{winter the}} Massachusetts AFL-CIO made a {{striking}} gesture. Still smarting from {{the battle over}} the North American Free Trade Agreement, the state federation decided to withhold routine PAC contributions from Congressional members who had voted for NAFTA. The decision stood {{in stark contrast to the}} many decades in which organized labor offered fairly unconditional, uncritical support to the Democratic Party and its candidates, even when Democrats failed to behave as allies. And while the Massachusetts example is singular and perhaps not an example of broader currents, it should be seen in light of other phenomena: the dissolution of rank-and-file unionists as a predictable Democratic voting block; the assertive distancing by the Democratic Party from its traditional constituencies (for example, acceding to the popular image that minorities, women, and workers are 2 ̆ 2 special interests 2 ̆ 2); the emergence of H. Ross Perot and his surprising appeal to some sectors of unionized voters; and the growing interest among local labor leadership in Labor Party Advocates, a pre-labor party organization. This is a moment in which old certainties about organized labor <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>are</b> becoming less certain; it is a circumstance that progressives within the labor movement should welcome and work with...|$|E
50|$|In 1893, Greenhalge ran for Governor of Massachusetts. He {{was opposed}} in the Republican {{nomination}} by Albert E. Pillsbury, {{a member of}} the reform-oriented Mugwump wing of the party. Pillsbury's nomination was opposed by the power Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, and Greenhalge was chosen as a relatively safe candidate against <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> John E. Russell. Russell was not as popular as the outgoing Democratic governor William E. Russell (no relation), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> further hurt by the start of the Panic of 1893. Greenhalge won an easy victory. He was the state's first foreign-born governor.|$|R
50|$|Both Labour <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> {{defending}} 7 {{seats in}} 2011, while the Conservatives defended 2 seats. Other candidates at the election included 4 from the Green party, {{who had not}} put candidates up in previous elections.|$|R
50|$|Subsequently, Chancellor Schröder {{triggered}} {{a loss in}} a confidence vote, which, in turn, necessitated an early general election. In the autumn of 2005, one year ahead of schedule, general elections <b>were</b> held <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Social <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> defeated.|$|R

5000|$|After Bush was re-elected, he made Social Security reform a top priority. He {{proposed}} {{options to}} permit Americans to divert {{a portion of}} their Social Security tax (FICA) into secured investments, creating a [...] "nest egg" [...] that he claimed would enjoy steady growth. This led <b>Democrats</b> to label <b>the</b> program a [...] "privatization" [...] of Social Security. Bush embarked on a 60-day tour to shore up public support for the plan, attacking the political reaction against reforms. Ultimately, Congressional Republicans could not reach a consensus on <b>the</b> plan, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> unanimously opposed. Bush was left without any political will to pass his reforms. The issue was dropped, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> status quo maintained.|$|R
2500|$|Throughout the 1840s, {{the issue}} of the {{abolition}} of slavery grew to become a significant force in Massachusetts politics. [...] Outrage over the extension of slavery into territories acquired in the Mexican-American War increased the popularity of the Free Soil Party, but they <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> unable to unite to unseat the Whigs who dominated state politics until 1850. [...] In 1849, Boutwell won the Democratic nomination for governor. [...] Because no candidate won a majority, the Whig-controlled legislature decided the election, choosing the incumbent Briggs. [...] The campaign brought Boutwell into close contact with Charles Sumner and Henry Wilson, leaders of the state Free Soil Party. [...] The parties flirted {{with the idea of a}} coalition, with <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> adopting an antislavery platform.|$|R

500|$|After their {{defeat in}} Maine, the Republicans began to emphasise policy {{differences}} more. One {{significant difference between}} them <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>was</b> a purposely vague statement in the Democratic platform endorsing [...] "a tariff for revenue only". Garfield's campaigners used this statement to paint <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> as unsympathetic {{to the plight of}} industrial laborers, a group that benefited from a high protective tariff. The tariff issue cut Democratic support in industrialized Northern states, which were essential in establishing a Democratic majority. Hancock made the situation worse when, attempting to strike a moderate stance, he said [...] "the tariff question is a local question". While not completely inaccurate—tariff preferences often reflected local concerns—the statement was at odds with <b>the</b> Democrats' platform <b>and</b> suggested that Hancock did not understand the issue.|$|R
50|$|The Association {{allowed the}} wardmotes to select any {{candidate}} they chose, and while many <b>were</b> active <b>Democrats,</b> other radicals and independent Chartists were sometimes elected {{on to their}} slate. Ironside also saw the wardmotes as a venue for the resolution of local grievances. For example, they took up complaints against pollution and inadequate street maintenance, and even petty crimes. On one occasion, Ironside found five youths disturbing <b>the</b> peace <b>and</b> a wardmote passed a resolution calling for their parents to bring them before the body. When one youth attended the next meeting, he was reprimanded, while the body pressed for summons for the others. Members of <b>the</b> police force <b>and</b> other relevant bodies were also free to attend the wardmotes to justify their actions, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> not universally critical of their actions.|$|R

25|$|The Whigs built {{a strong}} party {{organization}} in most states; they were weak {{only on the}} frontier. The Whigs used newspapers effectively, <b>and</b> soon adopted <b>the</b> exciting campaign techniques that lured 75 to 85% of the eligible voters to the polls. Abraham Lincoln emerged early as the leader in Illinois—where he usually was bested by an even more talented politician, Stephen Douglas. While Douglas <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> somewhat behind <b>the</b> Whigs in newspaper work, they made up for this weakness by emphasis on party loyalty. Anyone who attended a Democratic convention, from precinct level to national level, was honor bound to support the final candidate, whether he liked him or not. This rule produced numerous schisms, but on <b>the</b> whole <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> controlled <b>and</b> mobilized their rank and file more effectively than the Whigs did.|$|R
50|$|After the Civil War, high tariffs {{remained}} as the Republican Party remained in office <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Southern <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> restricted from office.

As industrialization proceeded apace throughout <b>the</b> Northeast, some <b>Democrats,</b> especially Pennsylvanians, became high tariff advocates.|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> Labour Party <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrats</b> <b>are</b> often {{portrayed as}} Britain’s pro- European parties. Indeed, both parties express a keen {{interest}} in keeping Britain in the European Union (EU) and in promoting a constructive engagement with other member states. Yet, to what extent can the two parties be characterized as Europhiles? In this article, we develop Taggart and Szczerbiak’s (2008) concept of hard and soft Euroscepticism, extend it to Europhile party positions, and apply it to Labour <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Liberal Democrats’ recent European policies. For this purpose, we analyze manifestos and party leaders’ key speeches on the EU. We find, overall, that <b>the</b> Labour Party <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrats</b> <b>are</b> ‘soft’ Europhiles whose discourses have focused on EU reform. Yet, whilst their EU policies are very similar, their EU strategies differ: the Labour leadership have generally tried to contain the salience of EU issues, whereas <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrats</b> have followed a more offensive EU strategy after 2014. This can best be explained through electoral incentives and internal dynamics...|$|R
50|$|The {{coalition}} between Labour <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrats</b> <b>was</b> narrowly re-elected at the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, with Labour losing 7 seats <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrats</b> gaining 1. <b>The</b> SNP {{also lost}} seats, though other pro-independence parties made gains. At the 2005 general election, Labour again. The boundaries in Scotland were redrawn {{to reduce the}} number of Westminster constituencies in Scotland from 72 to 59.

5000|$|The 68th New York State Legislature met from January 7 to May 14, 1845, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{majority}} <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> {{split between}} two factions: the [...] "Hunkers" [...] <b>and</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Barnburners".

Both of the temporarily appointed U.S. Senators, Dickinson and Foster, were also Hunkers, but the Barnburners claimed {{one of the}} seats.|$|R
5000|$|These issues {{highlighted}} the political work of Zionist radicals.

5|$|As the 46th Congress {{convened in}} 1879, the Democratic caucus was reduced, {{but they still}} held a {{plurality}} of seats. The new House contained 152 Democrats, 139 Republicans, and 20 independents, {{most of whom were}} affiliated with the Greenback Party. Many of Randall's fellow Democrats differed with him over protectionism and his lack of support for Southern railroad subsidies, and considered choosing Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn of Kentucky as their nominee for Speaker, instead. Several other Southerners' names were floated, too, as anti-Randall Democrats tried to coalesce around a single candidate; in the end, none could be found <b>and</b> <b>the</b> caucus chose Randall as their nominee with 107 votes out of 152. With some Democrats not yet present, however, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> began to fear that <b>the</b> Republicans <b>and</b> Greenbackers would strike a deal to combine their votes to elect James A. Garfield of Ohio as Speaker. When the time for the vote came, however, Garfield refused to make any compromises with <b>the</b> third-party men, <b>and</b> Randall <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> able to organize the House once more.|$|R
2500|$|Westervelt was {{politically}} an ardent {{but not very}} active Democrat. In 1840 {{he was elected to}} the Common Council, in which he served for two years as an Alderman from the thirteenth ward. Westervelt stepped back from active political involvement for a couple of years, but remained a shrewd observer of current affairs and recognized nuisances <b>and</b> <b>the</b> needs of the people of [...] "his" [...] town. He witnessed sharply increasing taxes between 1850 <b>and</b> 1852 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> establishment of a reform movement that began to decry excessive government spending. Grand jury revelations of widespread corruption on the common council heightened such concerns. Reformers mobilized <b>and</b> ran <b>the</b> Democratic incumbents out of office, electing in their place a combination of Whigs and reform Democrats committed to [...] "economy" [...] in government. In November 1852 Westervelt was nominated for Mayor of the city by reformist representatives of the Democratic party. The mayoralty election was held at the same time as <b>the</b> presidential election, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> successful in both.|$|R
2500|$|Immediately {{following}} {{what many}} media {{described as a}} [...] "judicial coup", {{a senior member of}} the armed forces met with factions of the governing coalition to get their members to join <b>the</b> opposition <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party <b>was</b> able to form a government, a first for the party since 2001. The leader of <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party, <b>and</b> former leader of the opposition, Abhisit Vejjajiva was appointed <b>and</b> sworn-in as <b>the</b> 27th Prime Minister, together with a new cabinet, on 17 December 2008.|$|R
50|$|Given {{the high}} levels of Democratic success in the 1930, 1932, 1934 <b>and</b> 1936 elections, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>were</b> in a {{difficult}} position in defending a large number of seats, even without these pressures.
