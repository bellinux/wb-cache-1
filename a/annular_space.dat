25|$|During construction, many {{problems}} were encountered in scaling up the WAGR design. Problems {{with the construction}} of the pressure vessel liner had distorted it, so that the boilers, which were to fit in an <b>annular</b> <b>space</b> between the reactor and the pressure vessel, could not be installed, and the liner had to be partially dismantled and rebuilt. This work only cost about £200,000, but there was a huge cost of financing for an extra 18 unproductive months a power station costing around £100 million, of which some 60% was already on the ground. Serious problems were also discovered with the design of the boilers, which had to withstand the pounding of hot carbon dioxide (CO2), pressurised to 600 pounds per square inch (4.1 megapascals) and pumped around the reactor coolant circuit by massive gas circulators, and the casings, hangers and tube supports all had to be redesigned. The cost of these modifications, and financing during the delays, caused severe financial pressures for the consortium and its backers, and in 1969 APC collapsed into administration.|$|E

40|$|An {{oscillating}} capillary nebulizer {{which is}} capable of nebulizing a liquid sample flow at micro flow liquid flow rates and which {{is capable of}} controlling the particle size and particle size distribution of the nebula. The oscillating capillary nebulizer comprises a pair of coaxial capillary tubes which are friction-fit mounted by way of peek tubing ferrules. The dimensions of {{the inner and outer}} capillary tubes are such that an <b>annular</b> <b>spacing</b> is created between the inner surface of the outer capillary tube and the outer surface of inner capillary tube. A liquid sample is introduced into the nebulizer through the inner capillary tube. A gas flow path is provided by the space between the inner and outer capillary tubes. The gas enters the gas flow path through a port {{in the side of the}} outer capillary tube. At least the inner capillary tube is made of flexible material. Preferably, the inner diameter of the inner capillary tube is small enough to provide jet flow of the liquid sample at low liquid flow rates. The gas flow velocity, which is a function of the gas flow rate and the size of the <b>annular</b> <b>spacing,</b> is sufficient to cause turbulence of the gas stream around the free end of the inner capillary tube, thereby creating instability in the system. This instability, depending on how the system is set up, will initially cause the inner capillary tube to oscillate. The oscillation causes the generation of a high frequency standing wave along a portion of the length of the inner capillary and a breakup of the liquid jet into uniform liquid drop sizes.

The flow is maintained by a periodic pressure gradient across the annulus. Making use of an appropriate set of similarity variables, the governing partial differential equations have been transformed {{to a set of}} a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The solution of the resulting equations subject to appropriate boundary conditions has been obtained using a singular perturbation technique. The frequency of pulsation has been considered to be large. The effect of the flow parameters on the unsteady component of axial flow has been discussed.

40|$|Testing of 1701 {{water wells}} in northeastern Pennsylvania shows that methane is {{ubiquitous}} in groundwater, with higher concentrations observed in valleys vs. upland areas and {{in association with}} calcium-sodiumbicarbonate, sodium-bicarbonate, and sodium-chloride rich waters—indicating that, on a regional scale, methane concentrations are best correlated to topographic and hydrogeologic features, rather than shale-gas extraction. In addition, our assessment of isotopic and molecular analyses of hydrocarbon gases in the Dimock Township suggest that gases present in local water wells are most consistent with Middle and Upper Devonian gases sampled in the <b>annular</b> <b>spaces</b> of local gas wells, as opposed to Marcellus Production gas.

50|$|In {{practical}} terms, an offset penetrant or annulus {{may very}} well present an added degree of difficulty for passing the fire test. A metallic sleeve {{as well as a}} metallic penetrant will conduct heat through the firestop. Insulation on the bottom of floor systems or in the middle of wall systems, {{as is the case with}} caulking or paint based (soft) systems, will encourage more heat to travel through the sleeve and the penetrant, which can put more stress on the seal on the unexposed side. In the case of a thin (below 4") firestop mortar, there is also more potential hazard from tight <b>annular</b> <b>spacing</b> because metal expands during the fire, thus squeezing the firestop - only to rapidly shrink when hit with the hose-stream test, which can let water through, thus failing the H rating in Canada or the entire rating in the US, where hose-stream testing is mandatory. Such a failure may no longer be visible once the test assembly has reached ambient temperatures again.|$|R
50|$|When steam {{passes from}} one stage to another through the diaphragm, some energy losses takes place, which are {{referred}} to as carry over losses and therefore, the kinetic energy of steam available at succeeding stage of moving blades for utilization is less than that of the exit at preceding stage.

50|$|There are {{occasions}} in which running a packer {{may not be}} desirable. For example, high volume wells that are produced both up the tubing and annulus will not include a packer.

5000|$|A resin-saturated felt tube made of polyester, {{fibreglass}} cloth or {{a number}} of other materials suitable for resin impregnation, is inverted or pulled into a damaged pipe. It is usually done from the upstream access point (manhole or excavation). It is possible to invert the liner upstream (e.g. from the downstream access point) but this carries greater risk. It is possible to install a liner from the downstream access point, upstream to a blind end however this carries the highest risk of all the CIPP installation methods. Little to no digging is involved in this trenchless process, making for a potentially more cost-effective and less disruptive method than traditional [...] "dig and replace" [...] pipe repair methods. The liner can be inverted using water or air pressure. The pressure required for inversion can be generated using pressure vessels, scaffolds or a [...] "Chip unit". Hot water, UV light, ambient cured or steam is used to cure the resin and form a tight-fitting, jointless and corrosion-resistant replacement pipe. Service laterals are restored internally with robotically controlled cutting devices in the larger diameter pipe. Smaller diameters (100mm) can be opened remotely however they are often reinstated by excavation. The service lateral connection can be sealed with specially designed CIPP materials. The resin used is typically polyester for mainline lining and epoxy for lateral lines. Since all resins shrink (epoxy resins shrink far less than poly and vinyl ester versions) and it is impossible to bond to a sewer that has fats, oils, and grease an <b>annular</b> <b>space</b> exists between the new CIPP liner and the host pipe. The <b>annular</b> <b>space</b> exists in all installations just some are larger than others and depending on the severity may need additional rehabiliation. There are multiple ways to prevent water from tracking in the <b>annular</b> <b>space</b> and entering back into the waste stream including: water swelling material (hydrophilic), lining of the entire connection and host pipe with a continuous repair (YT repari) gaskets, and point repairs placed at the ends of the host pipe and at the lateral connections.

Annular denuders are well suited for this purpose.

The flow loop permits foam flow through 25. 4 mm, 38. 1 mm and 50. 8 mm diameter pipes. The smaller diameter pipes are used to replicate the <b>annular</b> <b>spaces</b> between the drill string and wellbore.
