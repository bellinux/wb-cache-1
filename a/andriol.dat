5000|$|In October 2004, Michele Ferrari {{was sentenced}} to one-year prison (suspended) and a fine of 900 euros, for {{sporting}} fraud and abusive exercise of the profession of pharmacist. Ferrari's conviction in Italian court was based partly on testimony from Italian bicycle racer Filippo Simeoni. Admitting he had been doped since 1993, Simeoni told how he became affiliated with Ferrari in 1996. Simeoni testified that, {{in addition to a}} prescription of EPO hormone, [...] "we spoke about <b>Andriol</b> (testosterone), which I was to use after hard training sessions, with the aim of increasing my muscular power. Dr. Ferrari recommended I use Emagel the morning before controls, and another product to decrease my hematocrit.". Ferrari argued, in his defense: [...] "Andriol is easily detectable for several days in a normal urine test, so, it is impossible that I suggested he take one <b>Andriol</b> 20 hours before another race." ...|$|E
50|$|Testosterone {{undecanoate}} (USAN, BAN) (brand names Aveed, <b>Andriol,</b> Androxon, Cernos Depot, Nebido, Panteston, Restandol, Nebido-R, Reandron 1000, Undestor), or testosterone undecylate, is an androgen and {{anabolic steroid}} and a testosterone ester. It {{is used in}} androgen replacement therapy primarily {{for the treatment of}} male hypogonadism, and has also been investigated for use as a male contraceptive or as hormone replacement therapy in transgender men. Unlike other testosterone esters, testosterone undecanoate is available in both oral and intramuscular formulations.|$|E
50|$|Testosterone {{undecanoate}} {{is available}} in Europe and Aveed brand testosterone undecanoate was approved {{for use in the}} United States by the FDA in 2014, after three previous rejections due to safety concerns. It is administered at a dosage of 1,000 mg every 12 weeks via intramuscular injection. In addition to parenteral, an oral formulation of testosterone undecanoate (brand name <b>Andriol)</b> is also available in Europe, but must be taken {{two or three times a}} day in combination with food.|$|E
5000|$|... {{testosterone}} {{is available}} in Canada {{in the form of}} topical gels (Androgel, Testim), topical solutions (Axiron), transdermal patches (Androderm), and intranasal gels (Natesto).

5000|$|Phillips started {{bodybuilding}} in 1982, {{then moved}} to Southern California to train at Gold's Gym Venice beach (known as the Mecca of bodybuilding) in 1983, remaining until 1986, a period during which Phillips admits to steroid use, at different times cycling on Deca Durabolin, <b>Andriol,</b> Sustanon, and other drugs that helped him grow from 185 lbs. to 215 lbs. [...] After not succeeding as a bodybuilder, the 21-year-old Phillips moved back to Colorado where he took classes at the University of Colorado at Denver, specifically the study of exercise physiology and sports nutrition - {{with an emphasis on}} steroid chemistry.

40|$|International audienceTestosterone {{undecanoate}} (TU) {{has a low}} oral bioavailability {{of about}} 3 % in beagle dogs and 7 % in men. To avoid administration of a single dose in two oral units and to increase lymphatic absorption to minimise side effects in the liver, TU was incorporated into nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) and formulated as drug nanocrystals. Testosterone (T) was run as nanocrystal formulation for reasons of comparison. NLC and drug nanocrystals were produced by high pressure homogenisation. The in vivo studies were performed in male Wistar rats. The drug absorbed was quantified as testosterone analysed by EIA assay. The nanocarriers were compared with the commercial product <b>Andriol</b> Testocaps®. The drug nanocrystals reached about half the AUC of <b>Andriol</b> Testocaps® (testosterone) or were just below (testosterone undecanoate). The best NLC formulations possessed a 2 times higher AUC compared to <b>Andriol</b> Testocaps®. Highest bioavailability was obtained with 200 nm NLC. Nature of the lipid for the particle matrix and the drug loading (15 %, 30 %) affected distinctly {{the shape of the}} serum profile (cmax, tmax, prolongation of serum levels). Modification of these parameters should allow controlled adjustment of the serum profile to therapeutic needs. Due to the reduced volume of the nanocarriers, application of a single dose in one unit is possible...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNanostructured lipid {{carriers}} {{were loaded}} with testosterone undecanoate (TU), {{which has a}} low oral bioavailability. Methods: Different NLC dispersions were produced using the hot high pressure homogenization method. Particles were characterized using dynamic and static light scattering techniques, differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction. And the bioavailability was compared to a marketed product. Results: Nanostructured lipid carriers with up to 30 % TU load and sizes of about 600 and 200 nm could be achieved, allowing a direct comparison of the size effect in in vivo bioavailability studies. The zeta potentials varied between −[*] 20 and −[*] 40 mV. The bioavailability of <b>Andriol</b> Testocaps® in the fed state was matched. Conclusions: This opens the perspective of administering a single dose of dose of TU in one oral dosage unit and simultaneously having a bioavailability less dependent on the fed state...|$|E
40|$|Effects of oral {{testosterone}} undecanoate (<b>Andriol)</b> on blood hormone levels, moods, sociosexual functioning and self-image {{of the body}} were studied in four gonadectomized patients with complete testicular feminization. In a double-blind cross-over experiment, patients were treated with oral {{testosterone undecanoate}} (120 mg/day) or placebo for four weeks. Peripheral blood was taken for hormone assays {{at the end of}} each four-week period. Psychosexual functioning was reported once weekly, mood scales twice weekly. In three patients testosterone treatment resulted in adult male blood levels of testosterone and estradiol. One patient did not show increased steroid levels, possibly because of hyperthyroxinaemia. No systematic effects were found on coitus, masturbation, sexual thoughts, scores on desire for bodily contact, and on attention for physical appearance. In one patient there was a marked and sustained rise in the positive moods and a fall in negative moods during androgen treatment. These results do not demonstrate that androgen therapy is preferable to estrogen in gonadectomized women with complete testicular feminization with regard to psychosexual functioning...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of medicine on non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). Cases 32 male patients were enrolled from March 2012 to March 2016, with age range of 23 – 41 years old and infertility time of 1 – 3 years. Methods According to “WHO Human Semen Detection and Processing Experiment Manual";;;;;; fifth edition, semen routine was based on manual detection and serum hormones based on chemiluminescence detection, semen volume, sperm density, forward moving sperm ratio. If sperm was detected in semen {{for more than two}} consecutive times, the treatment was considered effective and was included into the statistical analysis. The detection parameters took the first test data and the last test data. Treatment <b>Andriol</b> and tamoxifen were used for idiopathic NOA while aescuven forte and aspirin used for NOA with varicocele (including two varicocelectomy). The time was four months. Results Of the 32 patients, 13 underwent testicular biopsy, pathological results showed six patients (46 per cent) with hypospermatogenesis, five patients (39 per cent) with maturation arrest, and two patients (15 per cent) with sertoli cell syndrome. Nine patients (28 per cent) had varicocele; two patients (6 per cent) underwent surgical treatment. After treatment, sperm was detected in 20 patients (63 per cent), seven of them (22 per cent) had detectable sperm in semen after one month of treatment; five (19 per cent) had sperm after two months of treatment; eight (25 per cent) had sperm after three months of treatment. Among the 23 patients with idiopathic azoospermia, 13 patients had detectable sperm in semen after treatment (56 per cent). The level of hormone gradually increased in 15 patients, rapidly increased in four patients, but four patients had no obvious change of hormone level. Among the nine patients with varicocele, three persons (including one patient undergoing surgery) had normal sperm density after 3 – 4 months of treatment, continuing the treatment for another 2 – 3 months, wife of the patients gained pregnancies. After treatment, seven patients had gradually decreasing serum level of FSH, LH and T while two patients had increased serum level of hormones. Excluding the three pregnancy patients, it was showed that the sperm density increased (t=- 3. 342, p= 0. 004) after treatment, so did the forward moving sperm ratio (t=- 4. 037, p= 0. 001), but semen volume had no significant changes (t=- 1. 698, p= 0. 109). Conclusion The treatment of varococele is important for the NOA with varicocele while <b>andriol</b> and tamoxifen is other method for the treatment of idiopathic NOA...|$|E
