5000|$|As a {{baseball}} player Ray was a talented catcher with a big bat. As a rookie He won a World Series ring in 1948 catching {{the hall of fame}} pitcher Bob Feller for the Cleveland Indians. Although Ray had a powerful bat his best weapon was his cannon of a right arm, in his short career he allowed very few stolen bases and quickly gained recognition as <b>a</b> gun <b>slinger</b> at the <b>plate.</b> Ray was known for his colorful antics with the umpires which may have earned him the nickname [...] "Deacon" [...] for the way he preached to the umps. On one occasion he stopped {{in the middle of a}} game and removed all of his catchers gear to kneel at home plate and pray to the lord to give the umpire eyesight because he must be blind, Ray was promptly ejected from the game.|$|R

40|$|The <b>Slinger,</b> <b>a</b> {{permanent}} {{facility that}} can be built and stationed in a low earth orbit and can {{reduce the cost of}} transporting satellites into geostationary orbit by a factor of three, is examined. The Slinger is described, giving its size, mass, capacity, and the construction of its tethers. Techniques for accelerating the tethers are discussed. The operation of the Slinger is examined, including its launching of a payload into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) and its return to lower orbit. The Slinger's cycle time, its handling of lighter GTO payloads, and the effects of orbital precession and drag are briefly discussed. A possible reusable second stage based at the Slinger is discussed, and missions involving higher velocity and heavier payloads {{that can be}} helped by the Slinger are briefly considered along {{with the use of the}} Slinger to provide astronauts with 1 g and the use of <b>a</b> <b>Slinger</b> on the moon...|$|R
50|$|Arguably, the {{greatest}} invention that affected {{not just the}} military, but all society, after adoption of fire, was the wheel, and its use {{in the construction of}} the chariot. There were no advances in military technology, until, from the mechanical arm action of <b>a</b> <b>slinger,</b> the Greeks, Egyptians, Romans, Persians, Chinese, etc., development the siege engines. The bow was manufactured in increasingly larger and more powerful versions, to increase both the weapon range, and armour penetration performance. These developed into the powerful composite and recurve bows, and crossbows of Ancient China. These proved particularly useful during the rise of cavalry, as horsemen encased in ever-more sophisticated armour came to dominate the battlefield.|$|R

40|$|Relative to {{most other}} {{materials}} silicon nitride is very erosion resistant. However, the resulting surface flaws degrade strength - a serious concern for component designers. AlliedSignal Ceramic Components GS- 44 in-situ reinforced silicon nitride was eroded in <b>a</b> <b>slinger</b> apparatus. Both transient (extremely low level) and steady-state erosion regimes were investigated. Alumina particles with effective average diameters of 140 Jim and 63 {mu}m were used at velocities of 50 m/s, 100 m/s, and 138 m/s. Biaxial tensile strength was measured. Strength decreased by about 15 % {{after a very}} small erodent dosage and then remained virtually constant with further erosion. In-situ reinforcement produces R-curve behavior in which the fracture toughness increases with crack size. The effect of this is quite dramatic with strength loss being significantly less than expected for a normal silicon nitride with constant fracture toughness...|$|R

50|$|In ancient times, {{the islanders}} of the Gymnesian Islands (Illes Gimnèsies) {{constructed}} talayots, and were {{famous for their}} skill with the sling. <b>As</b> <b>slingers,</b> they served as mercenaries, first under the Carthaginians, and afterwards under the Romans. They went into battle ungirt, with only a small buckler, and a javelin burnt at the end, {{and in some cases}} tipped with a small iron point; but their effective weapons were their slings, of which each man carried three, wound round his head (Strabo p. 168; Eustath.), or, as seen in other sources, one round the head, one round the body, and one in the hand. (Diodorus) The three slings were of different lengths, for stones of different sizes; the largest they hurled with as much force as if it were flung from a catapult; and they seldom missed their mark. To this exercise they were trained from infancy, in order to earn their livelihood as mercenary soldiers. It is said that the mothers allowed their children to eat bread only when they had struck it off a post with the sling.|$|R

40|$|The basic Waste Collection System (WCS) design under {{consideration}} utilized air flow {{to separate the}} stool from the WCS user and to transport the fecal material to <b>a</b> <b>slinger</b> device for subsequent deposition on a storage bowel. The major parameters governing stool separation and transport {{were found to be}} the area of the air inlet orifices, the configuration of the air inlet orifice and the transport air flow. Separation force and transport velocity of the stool were studied. The developed inlet orifice configuration was found to be an effective design for providing fecal separation and transport. Simulated urine tests and female user tests in zero gravity established air flow rates between 0. 08 and 0. 25 cu sm/min (3 and 9 scfm) as satisfactory for entrapment, containment and transport of urine using an urinal. The investigation of air drying of fecal material as a substitute for vacuum drying in a WCS breadboard system showed that using baseline conditions anticipated for the shuttle cabin ambient atmosphere, flow rates of 0. 14 cu sm/min (5 cfm) were adequate for drying and maintaining biological stability of the fecal material...|$|R

John Reid of the Trimontium Trust, finding holed Roman bullets {{excavated}} at the Burnswark hillfort, has proposed that the holes would cause the bullets to [...] "whistle" [...] in flight and the sound would intimidate opponents. The holed bullets were generally small and thus not particularly dangerous. Several could fit into a pouch and <b>a</b> single <b>slinger</b> could produce <b>a</b> terrorizing barrage.

Hanging from numb lips, participles dangle before crashing to the unwiped counter strewn with sentence fragments and forgotten asides. Hello, Author speaking—the real author, one Richard Montoya, not some narrative construct or self-aware, third-wall smashing narrator—here to address you directly, a pleasure you’ll enjoy now and never again in the preceding pages. So enjoy it while it lasts. I was once told that bars provide the tritest setting to a story imaginable. While {{not all of these}} stories contain scenes set therein (by some herculean strength I was able to contain myself) each of these stories does contain elements culled from establishments of an inebriating nature. Which is not to say I’m a proponent of the write drunk, edit sober mantra, but rather I find that the loosest lips let loose the most interesting narratives. Unfortunately I find myself sifting through piles of inconsequence to extract the quintessence, which might explain, to some degree, my somewhat bibacious nature. What you hold in your hands is that reduction, the promised Aqua Vitae, the water of life, my life, my mind in flowing, liquidious form. Drink up...|$|R
25|$|The Bible {{provides}} <b>a</b> famous <b>slinger</b> account, {{the battle}} between David and Goliath from the First Book of Samuel 17:34-36, probably written in the 7th or 6th century BC, describing events having occurred around the 10th century BC. The sling, easily produced, was the weapon of choice for shepherds fending off animals. Due to this, the sling was a commonly used weapon by the Israelite militia. Goliath was a tall, well equipped and experienced warrior. In this account, the shepherd David convinces Saul to let him fight Goliath {{on behalf of the}} Israelites. Unarmoured and equipped only with a sling, 5 smooth rocks, and his staff; David defeats the champion Goliath with a well-aimed shot to the head.|$|R
50|$|Oxylus, a one-eyed {{man from}} Aetolia, son of Haemon (himself son of Thoas) or of Andraemon. He was exiled from Aetolia {{on account of}} unintentional homicide; his victim was either his own brother Therimus or a certain Alcidocus, son of Scopius. In his wanderings, he met Temenus, son of Aristomachus, on a road. Temenus {{had been told by}} an oracle to look out for a man with three eyes, and Oxylus, having one eye himself and riding a horse or mule with two more, matched that description. Oxylus then, as the oracle had recommended, {{accompanied}} Temenus and his brother, Cresphontes, in their invasion of the Peloponnesus. For his aid, Oxylus received Elis, a fertile land, as his own; others say, though, that he had to win it. He had been wanting the land for himself for a while and, suspecting that the Dorians would not give it to him, led them through Arcadia and not Elis, so they {{would not be able to}} observe the goodliness of it. Nevertheless, he did have to fight over the land with the Dorian Dius. The latter proposed that each side chose a single soldier to represent his army. Degmenus, an archer, fought for Dius and Pyraechmes, <b>a</b> <b>slinger,</b> for Oxylus; the latter won, and Oxylus received Elis as his domain. In accordance with a prophecy of the oracle, he brought in Agorius, great-grandson of Orestes and thus a descendant of Pelops, as a co-founder. The land became prosperous under him. By Pieria, Oxylus had two sons: Aetolus, who died before his parents, and Laias, who inherited the kingdom after him.|$|R
