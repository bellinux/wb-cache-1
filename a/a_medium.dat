5|$|Maxwell also {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} the electromagnetic field in comparison to force lines that Faraday described. By understanding the propagation of electromagnetism as a field emitted by active particles, Maxwell could advance his work on light. At that time, Maxwell believed that the propagation of light required <b>a</b> <b>medium</b> for the waves, dubbed the luminiferous aether. Over time, the existence of such <b>a</b> <b>medium,</b> permeating all space and yet apparently undetectable by mechanical means, proved impossible to reconcile with experiments such as the Michelson–Morley experiment. Moreover, it seemed to require an absolute frame of reference in which the equations were valid, with the distasteful result that the equations changed form for a moving observer. These difficulties inspired Albert Einstein to formulate the theory of special relativity; in the process Einstein dispensed with the requirement of a stationary luminiferous aether.|$|E

50|$|A simple thought {{experiment}} {{highlights the}} biological basis of media naturalness theory, and the {{fundamental difference between}} the media naturalness and media richness theories. Let us assume that the human species had evolved in an ancestral environment without light. If that were the case, modern humans would all be blind, and therefore <b>a</b> communication <b>medium's</b> ability to convey facial expressions and body language would be irrelevant for effective communication. Conversely, <b>a</b> <b>medium's</b> ability to convey smell might be fairly important for effective communication. This illustrates {{the fact that one}} cannot define <b>a</b> <b>medium's</b> ability to support effective communication without taking into consideration characteristics of the communicators. Of these, biological characteristics often have an evolutionary basis.|$|R

40|$|AbstractComparisons of the {{laboratory}} physical modeling experiment and the finite element numerical simulation of the physical modeling experiment of wave propagation in <b>an</b> acoustic/elastic coupled <b>medium,</b> reveal that the finite element numerical simulation of the physical modeling experiment, when <b>an</b> elastic <b>medium</b> is modeled as <b>an</b> acoustic <b>medium,</b> is definitely inferior than that, when <b>an</b> elastic <b>medium</b> is modeled actually as <b>an</b> elastic <b>medium.</b> The elasticity of <b>an</b> acoustic/elastic coupled <b>medium,</b> as expected, has a pronounced influence on the shear wave conversion and propagation; in turn, the characteristics of wave forms and arrival events involve both the compressional and shear waves.
