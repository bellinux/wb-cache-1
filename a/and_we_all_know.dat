500|$|Iginla is {{well known}} for his kind-hearted nature. Former Flames General manager Craig Button {{described}} Iginla as being grounded: [...] "He doesn't carry himself with any attitude or arrogance. He's confident in his abilities. He's self-assured. He's genuine. He's a better person than he is a player, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> what kind of player he is." [...] In 2002, while in Salt Lake City for the Winter Olympic Games, Iginla struck up a conversation with four Calgarians sitting next to his table, and found out they were sleeping in their car outside of the hotel. He excused himself from the conversation, and booked them accommodations at his own expense at the hotel his family was staying in.|$|E
500|$|The {{video for}} [...] "Misery" [...] premiered on Stefani's Vevo account on May 31, 2016. On the same night, it was {{distributed}} to iTunes as a paid download in the United States. Outside North America, the video {{was available for}} preorder in several countries starting May 11, but was not officially released until May 31, 2016. A majority of critics praised the video for creating glamorous and fashionable surroundings. Bustles May Sofi ranked the nine outfits the singer wore during the video and listed her pink tulle frock at number one. The publication's consensus on their decision reads: [...] "This adorable pink frock is not only super wearable, it's also pretty on-trend. The pale pink tulle gives off a ballerina-chic vibe, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> how popular that style has been as of late." [...] The site listed the [...] "floral co-ords" [...] look in the bottom position, but still claimed that the outfit was [...] "probably the most costume-like of [...] all." [...] Seija Rankin of E! Online stated: [...] "Contrary to the song's title, this tune and the corresponding video is not actually miserable at all; it's quite upbeat." ...|$|E
500|$|... "No Future" [...] {{was nearly}} {{cut from the}} record. It was {{inspired}} by punk rock history, as many songs—for example, the Sex Pistols' [...] "God Save the Queen"—contain a [...] "no future" [...] lyric. [...] "Home Is Such a Lonely Place" [...] is a ballad with [...] "clean arpeggiated finger-picking guitars with strings underneath it." [...] Its lyrics are themed around lost love; it emerged from an early-morning coffee meeting between Hoppus and Feldmann, who both imagined how lonely their homes would be when their children grow up and move away. [...] "Kings of the Weekend" [...] was also nearly moved off the final track listing, but kept because of its recognizable guitar riff. Feldmann described it as [...] "the party song. We've all had day jobs <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> what it's like to have that day off {{to do what we}} want." [...] "Teenage Satellites" [...] is based around [...] "being a kid and not knowing who you are, not having enough courage to say what you mean." [...] It was the last song recorded for the album, and it was at first written without a hook or melody in mind. [...] "Left Alone" [...] made the album cut because the band liked Skiba's vocal performance. [...] "Rabbit Hole" [...] was one of Hoppus' favorites, and revolves around [...] "standing your ground and not falling for people's nonsense." ...|$|E

500|$|In June 2011, Julian re-joined {{his former}} club, now renamed simply Stevenage, on a free transfer, {{three years after}} leaving the club. The move meant that Julian would be playing under the {{management}} of Graham Westley once more, who first brought Julian to Stevenage in 2005 – Westley said [...] "Alan sees the opportunity {{in the long term}} <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> how much quality he will bring into the squad. He is a different type of character but another man that you would happily go into the trenches with". On signing for Stevenage, Julian said [...] "I had a great time at Stevenage before and coming back now and we are in League One, it is a dream come true". As a result of Chris Day dislocating his finger, Julian started in the club's first game of the 2011–12 campaign, keeping a clean sheet in Stevenage's 0–0 home draw against Exeter City. He played the first three games of the season, before first choice goalkeeper Chris Day returned from injury. Julian made just two further appearances during the campaign; in a 2–2 draw with AFC Wimbledon in the Football League Trophy, and an appearance as a second-half substitute in Stevenage's 2–2 home draw against Huddersfield Town. He was released by Stevenage when his contract expired in May 2012.|$|E
500|$|... "The Problem Solvers" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Robert Canning of IGN {{reviewed the}} episode, {{giving it a}} 7.4 out of 10 rating and opining the episode had [...] "a few audible chuckles and several silent smiles", and that the tone of it [...] "was just off." [...] He cited that the Liz and Jack characters on opposing sides [...] "was not {{as much fun as}} seeing them working together", and that Jenna and Tracy's antics throughout the series have been [...] "funny most of the time", though [...] "very little clicked in this episode." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that the Tracy and Jenna team [...] "often seems too far out of the realm of reality... to enjoy them." [...] Sepinwall was positive about Cheyenne Jackson's debut, noting he [...] "fit in well his first time out." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste magazine called the episode the [...] "best so far in the season" [...] but admitted he was [...] "disappointed in it" [...] for not coming [...] "close to greatness <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> [...] done it before and can do it again." [...] Gandert, who has not been a fan of Liz's [...] "Dealbreakers" [...] storyline, commented her plot here was [...] "somewhat annoying, generally not that interesting", and concluded [...] "it's hard to really care" [...] that Liz get her talk show.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} {{to release the}} files generated much controversy because it went against both parents' direct request, and because it reversed the earlier {{decision to}} seal the papers {{in the best interest}} of the child. Jim Oberweis, Ryan's defeated GOP opponent, commented that [...] "these are allegations made in a divorce hearing, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> people tend to say things that aren't necessarily true in divorce proceedings when there is money involved and custody of children involved." ...|$|E

5000|$|JAB {{relocated}} to Melbourne in August 1977 joining the punk scene and playing alongside the Boys Next Door and X-Ray-Z. Bohdan later recalled, [...] "They were very exciting times, we were changing {{the face of}} the music scene <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> it. .... <b>All</b> the bands on the scene just kind of found each other.

2500|$|Writing for CNN, Sonia Katyal and Eduardo Peñalver {{said that}} [...] "A {{straight}} line {{runs from the}} 1930s sit-down strikes in Flint, Michigan, to the 1960 lunch-counter sit-ins to the occupation of Alcatraz by Native American activists in 1969 to Occupy Wall Street. Occupations employ physical possession to communicate intense dissent, exhibited by a willingness {{to break the law}} and to suffer the -- occasionally violent -- consequences." [...] Another CNN report by Douglas Rushkoff, said that even though the protesters are not ready to articulate an exact array of problems or how to solve them,"Anyone who says he has no idea what these folks are protesting is not being truthful. Whether we agree with them or not, we all know what they are upset about, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> that there are investment bankers working on Wall Street getting richer while things for {{most of the rest of}} us are getting tougher. What upsets banking's defenders and politicians alike is the refusal of this movement to state its terms or set its goals in the traditional language of campaigns...They mean to show that there is an inappropriate and correctable disconnect between the abundance America produces and the scarcity its markets manufacture".|$|E
2500|$|Mary McNamara for the Los Angeles Times {{commented on}} {{parallels}} drawn between the Visitors and President Barack Obama, insofar as: [...] "The instant adoration, the attractiveness and rhetorical skills of Anna, {{the idea that}} the Visitors will woo us with universal healthcare and then destroy us all seem a right-wingish take on the president's ascendancy." [...] She continued: [...] "Perhaps that is the creators' intent, but most successful science fiction contains an element of, if not outright humor, then the absurd. That the human race will be enslaved not through brainwashing or firepower but adequate healthcare is pretty hilarious in a dark and almost possible way. And Anna and her crew seem to embody more of a Wall Street deregulated/Bernie Madoff mentality—big returns for minimum investment. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> how that turns out." [...] Linda Stasi for The New York Post conversely compared the Visitors to extremist Muslims. Though in the original series the aliens were a metaphor for Nazis, Stasi commented: [...] "TV shows no longer have to rely on Nazis, because now we have the hated extremist Muslims to make all bad-guy metaphors with", adding on the Visitors' appearance: [...] "Once you peel back the outer, good-looking shell, you've got your standard outer-space Nazi/Taliban lizard person lurking beneath." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{press in}} Australia and England blamed the hype {{surrounding}} Kerry Packer and his proposed World Series Cricket for tension within the Australian side (Malone had already signed a contract), {{leading to the}} poor performances. Malone disagrees, [...] "The press said we were a divided side," [...] says Malone, [...] "but {{that was not the}} case. There were 13 of the 17 players who had signed for Packer <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> each other <b>and</b> got on, Packer and non-Packer players.

2500|$|Derek is {{described}} by Inside Soap as [...] "a man who doesn't {{take no for an}} answer", [...] "dangerous and edgy" [...] and [...] "the exact opposite of poor Alfie." [...] The magazine said that if Derek chose to have an affair with Kat, he could end up back in prison if Alfie found out and would be taken away from his daughter Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks). They later said that Derek had previously declared that he and Kat were [...] "two peas in a pod", which would [...] "make her very appealing to an egotist like Derek!" [...] They said that [...] "sparks would fly if Derek and Kat hooked up. He's got that dangerous edge that [...] Kat loves, but Alfie lacks! <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> that Derek's a man who's used to getting what he wants—every time..." [...] Soaplife said that Derek is part of every other storyline and actor Foreman's contract was extended, so the chances of it being Derek are high, but they did not want it to be Derek. However, they later said they thought it would be Derek, as love is not Kat's motivation (ruling out Jack), and Derek {{is the only one who}} would not be cheating on a partner, saying the others [...] "would have to cheat on their other half [...] for no better reason than Kat has to cheat on Alfie (ie. none). And that would be too far-fetched." [...] They said Derek would probably enjoy the danger of being caught out by Alfie, and continued to rule out the other suspects, maintaining that they have seen nothing to change their minds that it is Derek. All About Soap wondered if Derek would have the time and inclination to woo Kat as he is struggling to bond with his children Alice and Joey Branning (David Witts), and opined that he would, and the fact that [...] "he's just the wrong side of dodgy, [...] right up Kat's street. Walford's creepiest couple could be on the cards!" [...] They made him their joint third favourite for the affair, along with Ray, and later said that an affair between Kat and Derek would be [...] "very believable" [...] but [...] "more than a little bit gross", noting that Derek is on a power trip and Kat loves to be dominated and as there is more to the affair than physical attraction, there would be a [...] "strong chance" [...] it would be Derek. Julie Emery of Heat said of the affair, [...] "Our money's on Derek. What a couple they'd make..." ...|$|E

5000|$|During {{the merger}} between Polygram and Universal, which {{ultimately}} put the album's release in limbo, the band {{decided to call}} it quits. Said Adams at the time: [...] "The decision was made for us, really, just by time and circumstance, and I respect things that happen like that. By the time we went to make Pneumonia, {{there were only three}} surviving members. Everybody kind of pooled thoughts together for that album, and when it didn't come out, {{it was kind of like}} we reached an end that's inevitable, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> it in the back of our minds." ...|$|R
