500|$|In 1997, ruling {{unanimously}} in {{the case}} of Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, the Supreme Court voted down anti-indecency provisions of the Communications Decency Act (the CDA), finding they violated the freedom of speech provisions of the First Amendment. In their decision, the Supreme Court held that the CDA's [...] "use of the undefined terms 'indecent' and 'patently offensive' will provoke uncertainty among speakers about how the two standards relate to each other <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> they mean." ...|$|E
500|$|... "A Golden Crown" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Todd VanDerWerff from the A.V. Club gave it an A-, and Maureen Ryan from AOL TV rated {{it with a}} 70 out of 100. HitFix's Alan Sepinwall titled his review [...] "The rules get upended in a terrific episode." [...] Both Elio Garcia from westeros.org and Jace Lacob from Televisionary considered it the best episode of the series so far. In the words of reviewer Jace Lacob, the episode [...] "revolves around changes both great and small, {{about the way the}} scales can fall from our eyes and we can see the truth that has been standing in front of us for so long. For Eddard, it's a realization of just why Jon Arryn died, of the terrible secret he had gleaned from the book of royal lineages, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> this could mean for the throne...and for the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. For Dany, it's the brutal truth of her brother's real nature, of his insatiable thirst for power and the twisted quality of his rampant heart." ...|$|E
500|$|Lombard {{was then}} {{recruited}} by the director Howard Hawks, a second cousin, to star in his screwball comedy film Twentieth Century [...] which proved a watershed in her career and made her a major star. Hawks had seen the actress inebriated at a party, where he found her to be [...] "hilarious and uninhibited <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> the part needed", and she was cast opposite John Barrymore. In Twentieth Century, Lombard played an actress who is pursued by her former mentor, a flamboyant Broadway impresario. Hawks and Barrymore were unimpressed with her work in rehearsals, finding that she was [...] "acting" [...] too hard and giving a stiff performance. The director encouraged Lombard to relax, be herself, and act on her instincts. She responded well to this tutoring, and reviews for the film commented on her unexpectedly [...] "fiery talent"—"a Lombard like no Lombard you've ever seen". The Los Angeles Times critic {{felt that she was}} [...] "entirely different" [...] from her formerly cool, [...] "calculated" [...] persona, adding, [...] "she vibrates with life and passion, abandon and diablerie".|$|E

500|$|The {{book was}} {{generally}} well received by critics, with several {{commenting on the}} honesty of the work. Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "Life offers much more than vicarious thrills. It captures the true spirit of rock and roll, the nitty-gritty {{of life on the}} road, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> {{it feels like to be}} a heroin addict who doesn't know where his next fix is coming from. It also movingly captures Richards' extraordinary love of music—an even more powerful addiction for him than smack—and perhaps more surprisingly, his manifest destiny as a human being." [...] Jim Fusilli of the Wall Street Journal said that [...] "Mr. Richards writes with disarming introspection about his childhood, family and fame. And it's quite likely that no rock musician has ever written so keenly about the joys of making music. With a warm sense of humor and willingness to share his grief, Mr. Richards in [...] "Life" [...] defies almost every public perception about him." [...] In The Independent, John Walsh commented, [...] "He tells it with complete, reckless, disclosure. Sometimes it sounds like a man ranting into a tape machine; sometimes, in the tidier and more reflective sections, you can detect the hand of his co-writer, James (White Mischief) Fox. But the watchwords of this book are honesty, confessionalism, telling it straight." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a July 2015 USA Today {{article about}} how the actors of The Cosby Show responded to the allegations, Keshia Knight Pulliam of the cast stated [...] "All I can speak to is the man I know and I {{love the fact that}} he has been such an example [...] you can't take away from the great that he has done, the {{millions}} and millions of dollars he has given back to colleges and education, <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> he did with the Cosby Show and how groundbreaking that was. The Cosbys, we were the first family that no matter what race, religion, you saw yourself in", further addressing the charges against Cosby. [...] "At the end of the day they are allegations ... I don't have that story to tell." ...|$|E
2500|$|The next day, Riggan {{wakes up}} in {{hospital}} with his face covered in a mask of bandages where his nose has been surgically reconstructed after he blew it off during the botched suicide. His ex-wife is worried about him but Jake cannot contain his excitement that the play will run forever after Tabitha's rave-review which called the suicide attempt [...] "super-realism" [...] <b>and</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> American theater needed. Sam visits with flowers, which he cannot smell, and takes {{a picture of him}} to scare the skyrocketing number of followers on the Twitter account she has created for him. While she steps outside to find a vase, Riggan goes into the bathroom, removes the bandages revealing his swollen new nose, and obscenely says goodbye to Birdman, whom he sees sitting on the toilet. Fascinated by some birds flying outside his room, he opens the window and climbs out onto the ledge. When Sam returns, Riggan is nowhere to be seen. She frantically scans the ground below the open window before she slowly looks up into the sky, smiles, and laughs.|$|E
