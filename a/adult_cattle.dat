40|$|The Busha is an {{indigenous}} breed of cattle in many Balkan countries. It has been bred for centuries. It belongs to primitive shorthorn cattle (Bos brachyceros europaeus). These cattle {{used to be}} the dominant and most important breed in almost all Balkan countries until the 1950 s and 1960 s, but today in lowland areas where intensive farming is practiced they have already been replaced by more productive and specialized breeds of cattle. In Macedonia this breed has officially been classified as a triple purpose breed (raised for meat, milk and draft) but considering its low production capabilities it is more similar to some primitive draft breeds. This breed is part of the National Biodiversity Program for the conservation of indigenous breeds of animals in the Republic of Macedonia. Economic, cultural and scientific reasons underlie the need to protect the biological diversity of autochthonous breeds of cattle such as the Busha. The aim of the research was to establish a gene bank for different strains of <b>adult</b> Busha <b>cattle</b> in the Republic of Macedonia. To this end, 998 samples of blood, 1100 hair coat samples and 958 doses of semen were collected from <b>adult</b> Busha <b>cattle.</b> Also, a phenotypic characterization was done on <b>adult</b> Busha <b>cattle</b> for their major productive and morphological traits.

25|$|In blood, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and {{eosinophilia}} may {{be observed}} in all types of fasciolosis. Elevation of liver enzyme activities, such a glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), is detected in subacute or chronic fasciolosis from 12 to 15 weeks after ingestion of metacercariae. Economical effect of fasciolosis in sheep consists in sudden deaths of animals {{as well as in}} reduction of weight gain and wool production. In goats and cattle, the clinical manifestation is similar to sheep. However, acquired resistance to F. hepatica infection is well known in <b>adult</b> <b>cattle.</b> Calves are susceptible to disease but in excess of 1000 metacercariae are usually required to cause clinical fasciolosis. In this case the disease is similar to sheep and is characterized by weight loss, anemia, hypoalbuminemia and (after infection with 10,000 metacercariae) death. Importance of cattle fasciolosis consist in economic losses caused by condemnation of livers at slaughter and production losses especially due to reduced weight gain.|$|E
25|$|A {{limitation}} of food sources {{in early spring}} and wild berry and nut crop failures during summer months may be contributing factors to black bears regularly feeding from commercial human-based food sources. Crops are frequently eaten by these bears, especially during autumn hyperphagia when natural foods are scarce. Favored crops may include apples, oats and corns. Black bears can do extensive damage {{in some areas of}} the northwestern United States by stripping the bark from trees and feeding on the cambium. Livestock depredations by black bears occur mostly in spring. Though black bears have the capacity to (and occasionally do) hunt <b>adult</b> <b>cattle</b> and horses, they seem to prefer smaller, more easily overwhelmed prey such as sheep, goats, calves, and pigs. They normally kill by biting the neck and shoulders, though they may break the neck or back of prey with blows from the paws. Evidence of a bear attack includes claw marks and is frequently found on the neck, back, and shoulders of larger animals. Surplus killing of sheep and goats are common. Bears have been known to frighten livestock herds over cliffs, causing injuries and death to many animals; {{whether or not this is}} intentional is not known. Occasionally, pets, especially dogs, which are most prone to harass a bear, are killed by black bears. It is not recommended to use unleashed dogs as a deterrent from bear attacks. Although large, aggressive dogs sometimes cause a bear to run, if pressed, angry bears frequently turn the tables and end up chasing the dog in return. A bear in pursuit of a pet dog has the potential to threaten both canid and human lives.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S., Biological Sciences (Molecular and Cellular Biology)) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2009. Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) {{are one of}} {{the leading}} causes of human {{gastrointestinal}} disease in the United States and other developed countries worldwide. Illnesses caused by STEC range from mild non-bloody diarrhea to hemorrhagic colitis that can lead to life threatening renal failure, a condition known as hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). The most common reservoir of STEC is cattle. Therefore, the majority of human outbreaks reported have been associated with the consumption of undercooked ground beef and other beef products (Arthur et al. 2002; Gyles 2007; Hussein et al. 2003). 	There are two main groups of cattle that are used in the beef manufacturing industry, feedlot <b>cattle</b> and <b>adult</b> range-grazing <b>cattle.</b> Earlier investigations of STEC prevalence have focused primarily on the O 157 :H 7 Escherichia coli serotype in cattle on feedlots. This is problematic, as over 100 other serotypes have been identified as having pathogenic potential in humans (Gioffre et al. 2002; Gyles et al. 1998; Law 2000), and not all cattle that enter the food chain spend time on feedlots. <b>Adult</b> range-grazing <b>cattle</b> are removed from their herd once past their reproductive prime, and sent directly to meat processing. They are not grain fed on a feedlot like younger cattle. Research that uses feedlot cattle for their investigations of STEC prevalence should not be applied to non-feedlot cattle. The two groups of cattle are managed differently and should be investigated separately. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence levels of all types of STEC in healthy <b>adult</b> range-grazing <b>cattle</b> from Northern California, specifically Sacramento County and neighboring counties. Our hypothesis was that healthy <b>adult</b> range-grazing <b>cattle</b> would have a prevalence of STEC lower than what previous studies utilizing feedlot cattle have reported. In this study, we also assessed the effects of precipitation and temperature on the prevalence of STEC in one isolated cattle herd over a sixteen-month time period, and then analyzed our data using linear regression analysis. To test our hypothesis, fresh fecal samples from 152 healthy range-grazing cattle were collected and evaluated for the presence of the Shiga toxin genes by PCR. It was determined that 71. 7...|$|R

40|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} infectious causes of diarrhea in <b>adult</b> dairy <b>cattle</b> with salmonellosis being most important. In my opinion, salmonellosis {{is the most}} important infectious disease of <b>adult</b> dairy <b>cattle,</b> regardless of clinical signs! The number of herds with Salmonella spp. infected cattle is estimated to be as high as 40 % (CEAH and NAHMS, 2009). Among infected cattle, clinical disease (diarrhea) can range from 0 % to nearly 100 % (epidemic) (Van Kessel et al., 2007). Epidemics usually occur when a new Salmonella serovar (often introduced from a newly purchased cow or from a feed source) is introduced into the herd. These epidemics may have a significant mortality, although most cows in the herd recover with supportive care within two weeks. Most recovered cows shed the organism in the manure in large numbers for three to four weeks and some become more chronic shedders. Farms that are endemically infected with a particular serovar may have sporadic diarrhea cases, often in periparturient cows or in cows with other medical conditions. A heavily contaminated maternity pen frequently serves as the source of infection for both cow and calf, and the stress of calving, early lactation, and other medical disorders enhance colonization of th...|$|R

40|$|Our {{primary goal}} was to {{generate}} an accurate estimate of the daily environmental loading rate of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts for <b>adult</b> beef <b>cattle,</b> using immunomagnetic separation coupled with direct immunofluorescence microscopy for a highly sensitive diagnostic assay. An additional {{goal was to}} measure the prevalence and intensity of fecal shedding of C. parvum oocysts in pre- and postparturient cows {{as an indicator of}} their potential to infect young calves. This diagnostic method could detect with a ≥ 90 % probability oocyst concentrations as low as 3. 2 oocysts g of feces− 1, with a 54 % probability of detecting just one oocyst g of feces− 1. Using this diagnostic method, the overall apparent prevalence of <b>adult</b> beef <b>cattle</b> testing positive for C. parvum was 7. 1 % (17 of 240), with 8. 3 and 5. 8 % of cattle shedding oocysts during the pre- and postcalving periods, respectively.
