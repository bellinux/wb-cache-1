5|$|Finally, an aminocarbonylation {{reaction}} {{reported by}} Stephen Buchwald allows conversion of <b>aryl</b> halides directly into <b>aryl</b> Weinreb–Nahm amides.|$|E
5|$|Caesium {{fluoride}} is also {{a popular}} source of fluoride in organofluorine chemistry. For example, CsF reacts with hexafluoroacetone to form a caesium perfluoroalkoxide salt, which is stable up to 60°C, unlike the corresponding sodium or potassium salt. It will convert electron-deficient <b>aryl</b> chlorides to <b>aryl</b> fluorides (halex reaction).|$|E
5|$|If the ylide carbon is {{substituted}} with an <b>aryl</b> or allyl group, the reagent {{is referred}} to as a semi-stabilized ylide. These have been developed extensively, second only to the classical methylene reagents (R1=R2=H). The substitution pattern on <b>aryl</b> reagents can heavily influence the selectivity of the reaction as per the criteria above.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, a one-pot magnesium–halogen {{exchange}} with subsequent arylation has been developed, showcasing {{the stability of}} the Weinreb–Nahm amide and providing an operationally simple method for the synthesis of <b>aryl</b> ketones.|$|E
5|$|Anhydrous SnCl2 {{can be used}} to make {{a variety}} of {{interesting}} tin(II) compounds in non-aqueous solvents. For example, the lithium salt of 4-methyl-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol reacts with SnCl2 in THF to give the yellow linear two-coordinate compound Sn(OAr)2 (Ar = <b>aryl).</b>|$|E
5|$|In the laboratory, POCl3 {{is widely}} used as a {{dehydrating}} agent, for example the conversion of primary amides to nitriles. Similarly, certain <b>aryl</b> amides can be cyclised to dihydroisoquinoline derivatives using the Bischler-Napieralski reaction.|$|E
5|$|Alkanes and <b>aryl</b> alkanes may be {{chlorinated}} under {{free radical}} conditions, with UV light. However, {{the extent of}} chlorination is difficult to control: the reaction is not regioselective and often results {{in a mixture of}} various isomers with different degrees of chlorination, though this may be permissible if the products are easily separated. <b>Aryl</b> chlorides may be prepared by the Friedel-Crafts halogenation, using chlorine and a Lewis acid catalyst. The haloform reaction, using chlorine and sodium hydroxide, is also able to generate alkyl halides from methyl ketones, and related compounds. Chlorine adds to the multiple bonds on alkenes and alkynes as well, giving di- or tetra-chloro compounds. However, due to the expense and reactivity of chlorine, organochlorine compounds are more commonly produced by using hydrogen chloride, or with chlorinating agents such as phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) or thionyl chloride (SOCl2). The last is very convenient in the laboratory because all side products are gaseous and {{do not have to be}} distilled out.|$|E
5|$|Armillaria gallica {{can produce}} cyclobutane-containing {{metabolites}} such as arnamiol, a natural {{product that is}} classified as a sesquiterpenoid <b>aryl</b> ester. Although the specific function of arnamiol is not definitively known, similar chemicals present in other Armillaria species are thought {{to play a role}} in inhibiting the growth of antagonistic bacteria or fungi, or in killing cells of the host plant prior to infection.|$|E
5|$|Due to its fat-soluble nature, TCDD {{enters the}} body through {{physical}} contact or ingestion. Dioxin easily accumulates {{in the food}} chain. Dioxin enters the body by attaching to a protein called the <b>aryl</b> hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcription factor. When TCDD binds to AhR, the protein moves to the nucleus, where it influences gene expression.|$|E
5|$|Alkyllithiums and aryllithiums {{may also}} react with N,N-disubstituted amides to give {{aldehydes}} and ketones, and symmetrical ketones by reacting with carbon monoxide. They thermally decompose {{to eliminate a}} β-hydrogen, producing alkenes and lithium hydride: another route is the reaction of ethers with alkyl- and aryllithiums that act as strong bases. In non-polar solvents, aryllithiums react as the carbanions they effectively are, turning carbon dioxide to aromatic carboxylic acids (ArCO2H) and <b>aryl</b> ketones to tertiary carbinols (Ar'2C(Ar)OH). Finally, they {{may be used to}} synthesise other organometallic compounds through metal-halogen exchange.|$|E
5|$|Organic mercury {{compounds}} are historically important but are of little industrial {{value in the}} western world. Mercury(II) salts are a rare example of simple metal complexes that react directly with aromatic rings. Organo{{mercury compounds}} are always divalent and usually two-coordinate and linear geometry. Unlike organocadmium and organozinc compounds, organomercury compounds do not react with water. They usually have the formula HgR2, which are often volatile, or HgRX, which are often solids, where R is <b>aryl</b> or alkyl and X is usually halide or acetate. Methylmercury, a generic term for compounds with the formula CH3HgX, is a dangerous family of compounds that are often found in polluted water. They arise by {{a process known as}} biomethylation.|$|E
5|$|TCDD and dioxin-like {{compounds}} act via {{a specific}} receptor {{present in all}} cells: the <b>aryl</b> hydrocarbon (AH) receptor. This receptor is a transcription factor which is involved in expression of genes; in fact {{it has been shown}} that high doses of TCDD either increase or decrease the expression of several hundred genes in rats. Genes of enzymes activating the breakdown of foreign and often toxic compounds are classic examples of such genes. TCDD increases the enzymes breaking down, e.g., carcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbons such as benzo(a)pyrene.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{conditions for the}} Weinreb–Nahm ketone synthesis are known to tolerate {{a wide variety of}} functional groups elsewhere in the molecule, including alpha-halogen substitution, N-protected amino acids, α-β unsaturation, silyl ethers, various lactams and lactones, sulfonates, sulfinates, and phosphonate esters. A wide variety of nucleophiles can be used in conjunction with the amide. Lithiates and Grignard reagents are most commonly employed; examples involving aliphatic, vinyl, <b>aryl,</b> and alkynyl carbon nucleophiles have been reported. However, with highly basic or sterically hindered nucleophiles, elimination of the methoxide moiety to release formaldehyde can occur as a significant side reaction.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the organolithium compounds, the {{organometallic}} compounds of the heavier alkali metals are predominantly ionic. The application of organosodium compounds in chemistry {{is limited in}} part due to competition from organolithium compounds, which are commercially available and exhibit more convenient reactivity. The principal organosodium compound of commercial importance is sodium cyclopentadienide. Sodium tetraphenylborate can also be classified as an organosodium compound since in the solid state sodium is bound to the <b>aryl</b> groups. Organometallic compounds of the higher alkali metals are even more reactive than organosodium compounds and of limited utility. A notable reagent is Schlosser's base, a mixture of n-butyllithium and potassium tert-butoxide. This reagent reacts with propene to form the compound allylpotassium (KCH2CHCH2). cis-2-Butene and trans-2-butene equilibrate when in contact with alkali metals. Whereas isomerisation is fast with lithium and sodium, it is slow with the heavier alkali metals. The heavier alkali metals also favour the sterically congested conformation. Several crystal structures of organopotassium compounds have been reported, establishing that they, like the sodium compounds, are polymeric. Organosodium, organopotassium, organorubidium and organocaesium compounds are all mostly ionic and are insoluble (or nearly so) in nonpolar solvents.|$|E
25|$|Potassium iodide {{finds its}} most {{important}} applications in organic synthesis mainly {{in the preparation of}} <b>aryl</b> iodides in the Sandmeyer reaction, starting from <b>aryl</b> amines. <b>Aryl</b> iodides are in turn used to attach <b>aryl</b> groups to other organics by nucleophilic substitution, with iodide ion as the leaving group.|$|E
25|$|The <b>aryl</b> {{hydrocarbon}} receptor (AhR or AHR or ahr or ahR) is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the AHR gene. The <b>aryl</b> hydrocarbon receptor is a ligand-activated transcription factor {{involved in the}} regulation of biological responses to planar aromatic (<b>aryl)</b> hydrocarbons. This receptor {{has been shown to}} regulate xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450.|$|E
25|$|The photo-Claisen {{rearrangement}} {{is closely}} related to the photo-Fries rearrangement, that proceeds through a similar radical mechanism. <b>Aryl</b> ethers undergo the photo-Claisen rearrangement, while the photo-Fries rearrangement utilizes <b>aryl</b> esters.|$|E
25|$|In 1904, Fritz Ullmann {{found out}} that copper powder could {{significantly}} improve the reaction of <b>aryl</b> halides with phenols to give biaryl ethers. This reaction is known as Ullmann condensation. In 1906, I. Goldberg extended this reaction to synthesize an arylamine by reacting <b>aryl</b> halides with an amide {{in the presence of}} Potassium Carbonate and CuI. This reaction is known as Goldberg modified Ullmann condensation. In 2003, R. A. Batey and T. D. Quach have modified this kind of reactions by using potassium organotrifluoroborates salts to react with aliphatic alcohols, aliphatic amines or anilines to synthesize <b>aryl</b> ethers or <b>aryl</b> amines.|$|E
25|$|Copper-promoted {{nucleophilic}} aromatic substitution. Electronegative {{groups in}} the ortho position of the <b>aryl</b> halogen are strongly activated toward these reactions. On the other hand, this reaction is inhibited by the steric hindrance provided by bulky groups on ortho positions of the <b>aryl</b> groups.|$|E
25|$|This {{cycle is}} not limited to vinyl compounds, in the Sonogashira {{coupling}} one of the reactants is an alkyne and in the Suzuki coupling the alkene is replaced by an <b>aryl</b> boronic acid and in the Stille reaction by an <b>aryl</b> stannane. The cycle also extends to the other group 10 element nickel for example in the Negishi coupling between <b>aryl</b> halides and organozinc compounds. Platinum forms strong bonds with carbon and does not have a catalytic activity in this type of reaction.|$|E
25|$|The {{compound}} {{has been}} found to act as an agonist of the <b>aryl</b> hydrocarbon receptor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aryl</b> boronic acids or esters may be hydrolyzed to the {{corresponding}} phenols by reaction with hydroxylamine at room temperature.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, N. Miyaura and A. Suzuki {{reported}} {{the synthesis of}} arylated (E)-alkenes in high yield from <b>aryl</b> halides with alkyl-1-enylboranes and catalyzed by tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium and bases. Then A. Suzuki and co-workers extend this kind of reaction to other organoboron compounds and other alkenyl, <b>aryl,</b> alkyl halides and triflate. The palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction organoboron compounds and these organic halides to form carbon-carbon bonds are known as Suzuki–Miyaura Cross-Coupling.|$|E
25|$|Reductive {{coupling}} is {{a coupling}} reaction of <b>aryl</b> halides with a stoichiometric equivalent of copper metal {{that occurs in}} the Ullmann reaction. In {{an example of a}} present-day cross coupling reaction called decarboxylative coupling, a catalytic amount of Cu(I) displaces a carboxyl group forming the arylcopper (ArCu) intermediate. Simultaneously, a palladium catalyst converts an <b>aryl</b> bromide to the organopalladium intermediate (Ar'PdBr), and on transmetallation the biaryl is formed from ArPdAr'.|$|E
25|$|The {{electronic}} {{trends in}} cation-π binding energy {{are not quite}} analogous to trends in <b>aryl</b> reactivity. Indeed, the effect of resonance participation by a substituent does not contribute substantively to cation-π binding, despite being very important in many chemical reactions with arenes. This was shown by the observation that cation-π interaction strength {{for a variety of}} substituted arenes correlates with the σmeta Hammett parameter. This parameter is meant to illustrate the inductive effects of functional groups on an <b>aryl</b> ring.|$|E
25|$|Boronic acids {{are used}} in organic {{chemistry}} in the Suzuki reaction. In this reaction the boron atom exchanges its <b>aryl</b> group with an alkoxy group from palladium.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} {{is reported to}} be favorable in ethereal solvents. This method was proved to be very effective for the oxidative coupling of amines and alkyl, including tertbutyl, and <b>aryl</b> halides.|$|E
25|$|HfCl4 {{increases}} the rate {{and control of}} 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions. It was found to yield better results than other Lewis acids when used with <b>aryl</b> and aliphatic aldoximes, allowing specific exo-isomer formation.|$|E
25|$|Oxidative {{coupling}} is {{the coupling}} of copper acetylides to conjugated alkynes in the Glaser coupling (for {{example in the}} synthesis of cyclooctadecanonaene) or to <b>aryl</b> halides in the Castro-Stephens Coupling.|$|E
25|$|A third {{method is}} by {{palladium}} catalysed reaction of <b>aryl</b> halides and triflates with diboronyl esters in a coupling reaction. An alternative to esters in {{this method is}} the use of diboronic acid or tetrahydroxydiboron (2).|$|E
25|$|Various cyclic amine {{groups can}} act as the basic moiety and potency stays {{relatively}} unchanged for example <b>aryl</b> piperazine, piperidine and morpholine. An acyclic tertiary amine is tolerated as the basic moiety but larger steric groups are less tolerated.|$|E
25|$|Alkyl halides {{are reduced}} by {{samarium}} iodide to the corresponding alkanes. The {{conditions of the}} reduction are compatible {{with a variety of}} functional groups, including alcohols, arenes, alkenes, and esters. <b>Aryl</b> halides are reduced to the corresponding halogen-free aromatic compounds.|$|E
25|$|Acetylacetone is a {{versatile}} bifunctional precursor to heterocycles because both keto groups undergo condensation. Hydrazine reacts to produce pyrazoles. Urea gives pyrimidines. Condensation with two aryl- and alkylamines to gives NacNacs, wherein the oxygen atoms in acetylacetone {{are replaced by}} NR (R= <b>aryl,</b> alkyl).|$|E
25|$|Aldehyde substituents suffer {{nucleophilic}} addition in {{the presence}} of organolithium compounds; however, adducts of aldehydes with lithium diamines can serve as effective directing groups for lateral lithiation. Subsequent treatment with an electrophilic primary alkyl halide and elimination of the diamine provides functionalized <b>aryl</b> aldehydes.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to {{the work on the}} destruction of <b>aryl</b> chlorides {{it has been shown that}} aliphatic chlorine and bromine compounds such as perchloroethylene, Freon (1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane) and halon-2402 (1,2-dibromo-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethane) can be dehalogenated by the action of radiation on alkaline isopropanol solutions. Again a chain reaction has been reported.|$|E
25|$|In the Favorskii {{reaction}} and in alkynylations in general, terminal alkynes add to carbonyl compounds {{to give the}} hydroxyalkyne. Coupling of terminal alkynes to give dialkynes is effected in the Cadiot–Chodkiewicz coupling, Glaser coupling, and the Eglinton coupling reactions. Terminal alkynes can also be coupled to <b>aryl</b> or vinyl halides as in the Sonogashira coupling.|$|E
