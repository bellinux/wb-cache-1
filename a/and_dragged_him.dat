5|$|In his 1931 autobiography, {{the public}} {{relations}} pioneer Harry Reichenbach {{claimed responsibility for the}} controversy surrounding September Morn– and the work's resulting popularity. He stated that Braun and Company had acquired some 2,000 reproductions of the painting which they could not sell, and then hired him for $45 so that he could unload the stock. They then paid for a large lithograph reproduction to be made and put on display. Reichenbach, he stated, then contacted public figures to protest against the display. When there was no response, he accosted Comstock in his office <b>and</b> <b>dragged</b> <b>him</b> to the dealership, where some young children, whom Reichenbach had hired for fifty cents each, lusted over the display. The public relations man then worked towards maintaining interest in the work, prints of which had already increased in price– from 10 cents to a dollar.|$|E
5|$|After {{four minutes}} of deliberation, the jury's foreman {{announced}} a guilty verdict and {{a sentence of}} death. The trial lasted about one hour. Court officers approached Washington to escort him away, but were pushed aside by a surge of spectators, who seized Washington <b>and</b> <b>dragged</b> <b>him</b> outside. Washington initially fought back, biting one man, but was soon beaten. A chain was placed {{around his neck and}} he was dragged toward city hall by a growing mob; on the way downtown, he was stripped, stabbed, and repeatedly beaten with blunt objects. By the time he arrived at city hall, a group had prepared wood for a bonfire next to a tree in front of the building. Washington, semiconscious and covered in blood, was doused with oil, hung from the tree by a chain, and then lowered to the ground. Members of the crowd cut off his fingers, toes, and genitals. The fire was lit and Washington was repeatedly raised and lowered into the flames until he burned to death. German scholar Manfred Berg posits that the executioners attempted to keep him alive to increase his suffering. Washington attempted to climb the chain, but was unable to, owing to his lack of fingers. The fire was extinguished after two hours, allowing bystanders to collect souvenirs from the site of the lynching, including Washington's bones and links of the chain. One attendee kept part of Washington's genitalia; a group of children snapped the teeth out of Washington's head to sell as souvenirs. By the time that the fire was extinguished, parts of Washington's arms and legs had been burned off and his torso and head were charred. His body was removed from the tree and dragged behind a horse throughout the town. Washington's remains were transported to Robinson, where they were publicly displayed until a constable obtained the body late in the day and buried it.|$|E
25|$|Judson {{was imprisoned}} for 17 months {{during the war}} between the United Kingdom and Burma, first at Ava and then at Aung Pinle. Judson and Price were violently arrested.

Kasatka tried to bite a trainer during a show in 1993, and again in 1999. On November 30, 2006, Kasatka grabbed a trainer <b>and</b> <b>dragged</b> <b>him</b> underwater during their show. The trainer suffered puncture wounds to both feet and a torn metatarsal ligament in his left foot.|$|E
25|$|On 24 July 1941 Dawson was the bomb-aimer and {{navigator}} in a Halifax aircraft {{taking part}} in an attack against the Scharnhorst, a German battleship that had been harassing North Atlantic convoys. Despite heavy fire from the Scharnhorst and circling Me109s, Dawson, who was by then positioned in the exposed aircraft fore-belly, achieved a perfect bomb release and five direct hits. The fierce German counter-attack resulted in Dawson's aircraft being badly damaged and the rear-gunner being seriously injured. Dawson then crawled {{to the rear of}} the aircraft <b>and</b> <b>dragged</b> <b>him</b> to the midsection where he injected him with painkillers.|$|E
25|$|Pippin {{joined the}} Army of the West, led by Aragorn, as it {{assaulted}} the Black Gate of Mordor {{in a desperate}} gambit. At the final parley with the Mouth of Sauron, members of all the races opposed to Sauron were represented, Men, Elves, Dwarves and Hobbits, and Pippin was the sole Hobbit (as Merry had been injured during the earlier Battle of the Pelennor Fields). During the last battle before the Morannon, Pippin slew a troll officer. The dying troll fell upon him, knocking him unconscious. Gimli later recognised his Hobbit feet under the troll <b>and</b> <b>dragged</b> <b>him</b> out of the battle, saving his life.|$|E

25|$|In 1998, Shawn Allen Berry, Lawrence Russel Brewer, and ex-convict John William King murdered James Byrd, Jr. in Jasper, Texas. Byrd was a 49-year-old {{father of}} three, who had {{accepted}} an early-morning ride {{home with the}} three men. They attacked him <b>and</b> <b>dragged</b> <b>him</b> to his death behind their truck. The three men dumped their victim's mutilated remains in the town's segregated African American cemetery {{and then went to}} a barbecue. Local authorities immediately treated the murder as a hate crime and requested FBI assistance. The murderers (two of whom turned out to be members of a white supremacist prison gang) were caught and stood trial. Brewer and King were sentenced to death; Berry was sentenced to life in prison.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} hours of April 19, 2013, in Watertown, a suburb of Boston, Tsarnaev was apprehended by police after being shot {{multiple}} times. The exact sequence of events remains clouded in confusion, as do key details. According to police, Tsarnaev's younger brother ran him over with an SUV <b>and</b> <b>dragged</b> <b>him</b> with the vehicle for , which is substantiated by the federal indictment. He was taken to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where, despite efforts to revive him by emergency medical personnel, he was pronounced dead from several critical injuries, massive blood loss, and cardiac and respiratory arrest. Emergency physicians said that he did not appear to have been run over. An eyewitness says that he was struck by a police SUV before he was shot multiple times.|$|E
25|$|The second {{match was}} a six-man tag team match {{featuring}} Nation of Domination (Faarooq, Crush and Savio Vega) against Bart Gunn, Goldust and Flash Funk. All the six men began brawling with each other, until Nation {{were sent to}} the outside. As they regrouped, Funk dived from the top rope onto all the three members of Nation. Funk hit a hurricanrana on Vega from the top rope and tried to dive on the Nation again but they controlled his landing <b>and</b> <b>dragged</b> <b>him</b> into the ring. Faarooq, Crush and Vega took turns and attacked Funk. After a great damage, he was able to tag with Gunn who took care of all three men. Gunn, Goldust and Funk sent Nation outside the ring and Gunn hit a diving bulldog on Faarooq and went for the cover but the referee was distracted in sending Goldust and Funk to the outside. Crush took advantage and hit a leg drop on Gunn while Faarooq pinned Gunn to get the win.|$|E

25|$|Three Israeli commandos were {{captured}}. The first captured soldier, {{the commanding}} officer of the assault team, was abseiling from the helicopter when he was attacked by ten men before his feet hit the deck. He was beaten across his body and head, then picked up and thrown to the lower deck, where he was attacked by a dozen activists. They beat and choked him, removed his bulletproof vest and sidearm and smashed his helmet, and shoved him into a passenger hall below deck. The second soldier {{was surrounded by a}} team of fifteen to twenty activists in two groups. One group attacked him when he landed on the ship's roof. He fired one shot at an activist holding a knife before being subdued. The activists seized his gun and beat him as he attempted to fight them off {{with his back to the}} hull. He was picked up by his arms and legs, and thrown over the hull. He attempted to hang onto the hull with both hands, but was forced to let go when activists beat his hands and pulled him down by his legs. He was then surrounded by another group of activists, stabbed in the stomach and dragged into a lounge while being beaten. A third soldier who was lowered onto the deck saw an activist waiting to attack him with an iron crowbar. After shoving him away, he was attacked by four more activists, one of whom wrapped a chain around his neck and choked him until he lost consciousness. He was then thrown onto the bridge deck, where he was attacked by about twenty activists, who beat him, cut away his equipment, <b>and</b> <b>dragged</b> <b>him</b> into the lounge. The three soldiers were severely wounded and bleeding heavily. Two of the soldiers had their hands tied, and a third was unconscious and went into convulsions. During their captivity, they were subjected to physical and verbal abuse, and photographed and filmed. One of the soldiers said that he was beaten after he began moving and yelling that one of the soldiers needed a doctor, and another said that he was placed onto a couch, beaten, and threatened that he would be beaten every time he moved. Although radical activists attempted to harm them further, more moderate passengers intervened and protected the soldiers. Two were given water and one with a severe stomach wound was given a gauze pad. Hasan Huseyin Uysal, a Turkish doctor, cleaned the blood off their faces and tended to facial cuts.|$|E
500|$|The presidential {{campaign}} of 1904, as Roosevelt sought election {{in his own}} right, brought Mr. Dooley ample opportunity to comment. The bartender mocked those who wished to be vice presidential candidate on Roosevelt's ticket, alleging that the Republicans [...] "found a man from Wisconsin who was in drink and almost nominated him when his wife came in <b>and</b> <b>dragged</b> <b>him</b> away. They got Senator Fairbanks to accept... by showing him a picture of our great and noble president trying to jump a horse over a six-foot fence". The president's enthusiastic campaigning attracted Mr. Dooley's attention: [...] "And when Theodore Roosevelt kisses a baby thousands of mothers in {{all corners of the}} land hear the report and the baby knows it's been kissed and bears the honorable scar through life. Twenty years from now the country will be full of young fellows looking as though they'd graduated from a German college." ...|$|E
500|$|The tour {{started on}} 28 October 1973. The {{original}} plan {{had been to}} play most of the album, but after the first gig at Stoke-on-Trent, the band dropped [...] "The Dirty Jobs", [...] "Is It In My Head" [...] and [...] "I've Had Enough" [...] from the set. Both Daltrey and Townshend felt they had to describe the plot in detail to the audience, which took up valuable time on stage. A few shows later in Newcastle upon Tyne, the backing tapes to [...] "5:15" [...] came in late. Townshend stopped the show, grabbed Pridden, who was controlling the mixing desk, <b>and</b> <b>dragged</b> <b>him</b> onstage, shouting obscenities at him. Townshend subsequently picked {{up some of the}} tapes and threw them over the stage, kicked his amplifier over, and walked off. The band returned 20 minutes later, playing older material. Townshend and Moon appeared on local television the following day and attempted to brush things off. The Who played two other shows in Newcastle without incident.|$|E

[...] "He was already built like a grown man; he was all cut up (like a bodybuilder). I asked him, 'Can I help you sir?' He looked around to see who I was talking to. I said, 'Are you looking for a student?' He said, 'No, I go here.' He said he was a freshman. I thought he was lying." [...] When the defensive coordinator kicked Gholston off the team for being too soft, Wilcher went to his house <b>and</b> <b>dragged</b> <b>him</b> back into the program: [...] "I told him I didn't care if he wasn't tough enough, he was going to play football for me," [...] Wilcher said. [...] "I knew that he had desire to play. My only regret is that I didn't put him at running back. I didn't know how fast he was." ...|$|E
500|$|Patton {{arrived at}} the {{hospital}} the same day, accompanied {{by a number of}} medical officers, as part of his tour of the U.S. II Corps troops. He spoke to some patients in the hospital, commending the physically wounded. He then approached Kuhl, who {{did not appear to be}} physically injured. Kuhl was sitting slouched on a stool midway through a tent ward filled with injured soldiers. When Patton asked Kuhl where he was hurt, Kuhl reportedly shrugged and replied that he was [...] "nervous" [...] rather than wounded, adding, [...] "I guess I can't take it." [...] Patton [...] "immediately flared up," [...] slapped Kuhl across the chin with his gloves, then grabbed him by the collar <b>and</b> <b>dragged</b> <b>him</b> to the tent entrance. He shoved him out of the tent with a kick to his backside. Yelling [...] "Don't admit this son of a bitch", Patton demanded that Kuhl be sent back to the front, adding, [...] "You hear me, you gutless bastard? You're going back to the front." ...|$|E
500|$|The gang {{lived in}} or around London. [...] For a time Turpin stayed at Whitechapel, {{before moving to}} Millbank. [...] On 4February 1735 he met John Fielder, Samuel Gregory, Joseph Rose, and John Wheeler, at an inn along The Broadway in London. [...] They planned to rob the house of Joseph Lawrence, a farmer at Earlsbury Farm in Edgware. [...] Late that afternoon, after {{stopping}} twice along the way for food and drink, they captured a shepherd boy and burst into the house, armed with pistols. [...] They bound the two maidservants, and brutally attacked the 70-year-old farmer. [...] They pulled his breeches around his ankles, <b>and</b> <b>dragged</b> <b>him</b> around the house, but Lawrence refused to reveal the whereabouts of his money. [...] Turpin beat Lawrence's bare buttocks with his pistols, badly bruising him, {{and other members of}} the gang beat him around the head with their pistols. [...] They emptied a kettle of water over his head, forced him to sit bare-buttocked on the fire, and pulled him around the house by his nose, and hair. [...] Gregory took one of the maidservants upstairs and raped her. [...] For their trouble, the gang escaped with a haul of less than £30.|$|E

2500|$|The Men of Dor-lómin indeed {{fought to}} the death. Late in the afternoon, Huor was killed, {{shot through the}} eye with a {{poisoned}} arrow, {{and all the others}} were killed; the Orcs chopped the heads off the bodies and piled them [...] "as a mound of gold in the sunset". Finally, Húrin was the only one left, and during this very last phase of the battle he killed no fewer than seventy of Morgoth's soldiers. But Morgoth gave orders that Húrin was to be taken alive, and the corpses of Orcs eventually became so numerous that at the end he fell trapped beneath a pile of them. The battle thus ending, Gothmog bound him <b>and</b> <b>dragged</b> <b>him</b> to Angband.|$|E
