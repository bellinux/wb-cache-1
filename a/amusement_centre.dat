40|$|This report summarises the indings of {{a survey}} amongst {{respondents}} connected with the <b>amusement</b> and leisure <b>centre</b> industry {{in the inner city}} area of Perth in April 1988. The survey canvassed perception of the social composition of users of the <b>amusement</b> <b>centres</b> and the pattern of centre usage. It asked questions concerning a number of areas of social concern that are sometimes raised in connection with centres, and canvassed opinion regarding the need for regulation or licensing of centres. Briefly, the survey found that: There is no evidence to suggest that <b>amusement</b> <b>centres</b> are in any way connected with drug dealing or usage, nor prostitution or sexual exploitation of young people. On the contrary, such activities are less likely there than at many other venues. Disorderly conduct of various kinds is rare within centres but is associated with groupings of young people outside some centres with reasonable frequency. This is usually of the order of a fight or of loud abusive language. The cause of this cannot be sheeted home to <b>amusement</b> <b>centres</b> with any surety without significant further research. <b>Amusement</b> <b>centres</b> satisfy various social and psychological needs of young people which would need to be catered for in other ways if access to these centres were restricted. There appears to be little call for licensing of centres. Centres within the inner city area appear to be sufficiently rigorous in their own application of adequate standards of behaviour and it does not appear that formal regulation would achieve much further benefit. Generally, while it is appropriate that the State government maintain a watching brief on centres, {{little in the way of}} social policy imperatives seem necessary for inner city centres at this stage...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a representative sample}} of the wrong use of both seat belts and child seats. The study was conducted {{on the basis of the}} results of a before study. In March and April 1991, 578 interviews were held, and 973 measurements were carried out. The field study took place on parking places near <b>amusement</b> parks, shopping <b>centres,</b> and wayside restaurants, spread all over the Netherlands. The most important results are as follows: (1) Nine measurements could not be used; (2) 69 % of the child seats were used in the wrong way; (3) Seat belts on the front seats were used considerably better than the child seats; (4) Seat belts on the rear seats investigated were mainly used by children under 12 years old; and (5) Many child seat errors were caused by interface problems between the child seat and the passenger car.

40|$|Quality {{management}} systems {{have recently been}} implemented in all sectors of the UK leisure industry. The author has attempted to discover {{whether or not their}} introduction has improved service delivery to external customers. The research project was developed so that the SERVQUAL instrument, devised by Zeithami, Parasuraman and Berry (1990), could be applied to a diverse range of leisure facilities; art gallery, museum, <b>amusement</b> park, leisure <b>centre,</b> golf course and theatre. Diversity was also achieved by the operational environments of the facility providers; public (local and central government), commercial and voluntary. A quantitative and qualitative research approach was implemented. In the first phase, the model generated numerical data, to analyse five gaps that cause service quality problems. The perspectives of the managers and operational staff as well as the customers were investigated. The model is based on a number of concepts, that are not without their critics. The first, is that customers are satisfied when their expectations of a service equal their perceptions of the service actually delivered. This has been questioned by Carman (1990). Secondly, the notion that "excellence" is the benchmark that customers should judge organisations by and for organisations to try to emulate. The author questions {{whether or not this is}} valid when the non-profit sectors of an industry are measured. The the author concludes that the SERVQUAL model would be valid if industry, sector and facility specific instruments could be developed. The second aspect of the thesis was to investigate service quality improvement. There is little evidence to suggest that any of the organisations researched totally embrace the philosophy of a quality leisure experience for their customers. At present simplistic, very mechanistic quality approaches have been initiated. The organisations' know what their customers needs are but are deflected from these to cope reactivly with external factors especially statutory regulations. The introduction of quality processes into operational procedures were carried out when looking for solutions for regulation compliance; improvements to service quality comes about as a by-product...|$|R

40|$|In {{the year}} 1999 {{the project of}} the inventarisation of the {{historic}} gardens in Austria, financed by the Austrian Science Fund FWF was finished with the manuscript “Historic Gardens in Austria. Gardens and Parks from the Renaissance to 1930 ”. Since 1984 this project {{was in charge of}} the author with some other co-workers at the Technical University of Vienna, Department of Landscape Planning and Garden History. This first Austrian inventory tended to consider public and private gardens, parks and artistically formed landscapes of all nine Austrian states from the Renaissance to about 1930 in a systematic manner. In the years of the inventarisation over 1750 historic gardens and parks were discovered, photographed and described. For the publication this numerous and mostly unknown quantity of gardens and parks was arranged in typological groups: gardens and parks of ecclesiastic dwelling-houses as monasteries, convents and cloisters, episcopal and provost buildings, parsonages, gardens and parks of profane buildings as castles, chateaus, palaces, manor-houses, country-houses, villas, dwelling-buildings, development houses, farmhouses, mills, factories, public buildings (monumental buildings) of culture (museum, theatre), education (school, university, botanic garden, arboretum), healing and welfare work (hospital, sanatorium, old people´s home, residential home, youth welfare home), administration (office, embassy), catering and hotel industry and tourism (hotel, inn, restaurant), sport, recreation and leisure (swimming-bath, shooting-stand, <b>amusement</b> park, leisure <b>centre),</b> public gardens and parks (without any main-building) as green places, village parks, town parks, village woods, town woods, parks of a spa, memorial parks, promenades, green outside staircases. With the elaboration of the results of the inventarisation, with the consideration of the trade literature, historic maps, plans, views, pictures and other source materials it was possible to present the first documentation of the existing historic gardens and parks in Austria in three volumes, published 2002 - 2004 (Böhlau Verlag, Wien-Köln-Weimar). This first survey makes known the rich existence of historic garden substance, is available to further scientific research on Austrian garden art and garden culture and affords first informations to protect and preserve this important cultural heritage. The second volume of the inventarisation of the historic gardens and parks in Austria presents the public and private gardens of the Austrian states Upper Austria, Salzburg, Vorarlberg, Carinthia, Styria and Tyrol.
