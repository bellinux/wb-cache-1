5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly inelastic (Ed = 0), changes in the price do not affect the quantity demanded for the good; raising prices will always cause total revenue to increase. Goods necessary to survival can be classified here; a rational person {{will be willing to}} pay <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> good if the alternative is death. For example, a person in the desert weak and dying of thirst would easily give all the money in his wallet, no matter how much, for a bottle of water if he would otherwise die. His demand is not contingent on the price.|$|E

Naidu was busy on the set of Munna (2007) and was unable to shoot it so cinematographer K. V. Guhan, who had worked on Mahesh's Athadu (2005), was recruited instead. The film's climax sequences were shot in March 2006 at the defunct Binny Mills located in Chennai under the supervision of FEFSI Vijayan. He suggested that Jagannadh include a scene where Prakash Raj fails to hear <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while after he is hit by Mahesh during the climax sequence.|$|E
500|$|In early 1990, Nirvana began {{planning}} {{its second}} album for Sub Pop, tentatively titled Sheep. For the album, Sub Pop head Bruce Pavitt suggested Butch Vig {{as a potential}} producer. Nirvana particularly liked Vig's work with Killdozer and called Vig up to tell him, [...] "We want to sound as heavy as that record." [...] The band traveled out to Vig's Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin, recording from April 2nd to 6th, 1990, [...] Most of the basic song arrangements were completed by that time, but Cobain was still working on lyrics and the band was unsure of which songs to record. Ultimately, eight songs were recorded: [...] "Immodium" [...] (later renamed [...] "Breed"), [...] "Dive" [...] (later released as the B-side to [...] "Sliver"), [...] "In Bloom", [...] "Pay to Play" [...] (eventually renamed [...] "Stay Away" [...] and given {{a new set of}} lyrics), [...] "Sappy", [...] "Lithium", [...] "Here She Comes Now" [...] (released on Velvet Underground Tribute Album: Heaven and Hell Volume 1), and [...] "Polly". On April 6th, [...] the band played a local show in Madison with fellow Seattle band Tad [...] [...] Vig began to mix the recordings while the band hung out in Madison, [...] giving an interview to Madison's community radio station WORT on April 7th [...] Nirvana had planned to record more tracks, but Cobain had strained his voice, forcing Nirvana to shut down recording. On April 8th the group headed to [...] Milwaukee, Wi to kick off an extensive Midwest and East Coast tour of 24 shows in 39 days[...] Vig was told that the group would come back to record more songs, but the producer did not hear <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while. With the band parting ways with drummer Chad Channing after the tour, additional recording was put on hold. Instead, Nirvana used the sessions as a demo tape to shop for a new label. Within a few months, the tape was circulating amongst major labels, creating a buzz around the group.|$|E

A few weeks before the film's premiere, De Palma told the crew not to get their hopes up about the film's reception.

2500|$|... "Loser" [...] {{was first}} {{released}} in March 1993 as a 12" [...] vinyl single on Bong Load, with only 500 copies pressed. Beck felt that [...] "Loser" [...] was mediocre, and only agreed to its release at Rothrock's insistence. [...] "Loser" [...] unexpectedly received radio airplay, starting in Los Angeles, where college radio station KXLU {{was the first}} to play it, followed by modern rock station KROQ-FM. The song then spread to Seattle through KNDD, and KROQ-FM began playing the song on an almost hourly basis. By the time stations in New York were requesting copies of [...] "Loser", Bong Load had already run out. Beck was soon beset with offers to sign with major labels. Convinced that the song was a potential hit, Rothrock gave a vinyl pressing of the single to his friend Tony Berg, who had been working in the A department for Geffen Records. Berg said, [...] "I just lost my mind when I heard it. He left my office, and I swear, {{by the time he got}} home, I had left a message asking him to introduce me to [...] ". Beck, in spite of his hesitance to be on any major label, signed with Geffen subsidiary DGC. He explained, [...] "I wasn't going to do <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time, but Bong Load didn't have the means to make as many copies as people wanted. Geffen were involved and they wanted to make it to more of an organized place, one with a bigger budget and better distribution." ...|$|E

Several years later, wanting to be closer to her sons, she returned to Los Angeles and obtained a real estate license, like her eldest sister, Kay. In 1995, she landed a small part as the [...] "Madam" [...] in Wild Bill. In 1998, she appeared as herself in the Kevin Burns TV documentary Behind the Planet of the Apes about the making of the first five Planet of the Apes films. In October 1998, Harrison attended her first science fiction convention in New Jersey. Also in attendance were Jonathan Harris, Marta Kristen, Mark Goddard and Angela Cartwright, of the original Lost in Space TV series; Lou Ferrigno of The Incredible Hulk TV series; and Bela Lugosi Jr. and Sara Karloff. Harrison found it [...] "rewarding when you really haven't done <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> number of years and then, all of a sudden, people want your autograph. It was very gratifying." [...] Eventually, Harrison became an institution at Planet of the Apes cons. [...] "I like it. It's very good. You're being appreciated for your work." [...] In 2001, she had a cameo as the [...] "Woman in Cart" [...] in Tim Burton's remake of Planet of the Apes. [...] "They are much more brutal in the new movie," [...] she said. [...] "And strong.

2500|$|There are {{commonly}} {{said to be}} three (or maybe four) small exceptions to the rule against enforcing non-charitable purpose trusts, and there is one certain and major loophole. First, trusts can be created for building and maintaining graves and funeral monuments. Second, trusts have been allowed for the saying of private masses. Third, it was (long before the Hunting Act 2004) said to lawful to have a trust promoting fox hunting. These [...] "exceptions" [...] {{were said to be}} fixed in Re Endacott, where a minor businessman in who lived in Devon wanted to entrust money [...] "for the purpose of providing some useful memorial to myself". Lord Evershed MR held this invalid because it was not a grave, let alone charitable. It has, however, been questioned whether the existing categories are in fact true exceptions given that graves and masses could be construed as trusts which ultimately benefit the landowner, or the relevant church. In any case the major exception to the no purpose trust rule is that in many other common law countries, particularly the United States and a number of Caribbean states, they can be valid. If capital is entrusted under the rules of other jurisdictions the Recognition of Trusts Act 1987 Schedule 1, articles 6 and 18 requires that the trusts are recognised. This follows the Hague Trust Convention of 1985, which was ratified by 12 countries. The UK recognises any offshore trusts unless they are [...] "manifestly incompatible with public policy". Even trusts in countries that are [...] "offshore financial centres" [...] (typically described as [...] "tax havens" [...] because wealthy individuals or corporations shift their assets there to avoid paying taxes in the UK), purpose trusts can be created which serve no charitable function, or any function related to the good of society, so long as the trust document specifies someone to be an [...] "enforcer" [...] of the trust document. These include Jersey, the Isle of Mann, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands. It is argued, for example by David Hayton, a former UK academic trust lawyer who was recruited to serve on the Caribbean Court of Justice, that having an enforcer resolves any problem of ensuring that the trust is run accountably. This substitutes for the oversight that beneficiaries would exercise. The result, it is argued, is that English law's continued prohibition on non-charitable purpose trusts is antiquated and ineffective, and is better removed so that money remains [...] "onshore". This would also have the consequence, like in the US or the tax haven jurisdictions, that public money would be used to enforce trusts over vast sums of wealth which might never do <b>anything</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> living person.|$|E
