40|$|Since {{unmanned}} aircraft {{do not have}} a human on board, they need to have a sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> capability that provides an "equivalent level of safety" (ELOS) to manned aircraft. The question then becomes - is sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> ELOS for {{unmanned aircraft}} adequate to satisfy the requirements of 14 CFR 91. 113 ? Access 5 has proposed a definition of sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid,</b> but the question remains as to whether any sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> system can comply with 14 CFR 91. 113 as currently written. The Access 5 definition of sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> ELOS allows {{for the development of a}} sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> system for unmanned aircraft that would comply with 14 CFR 91. 113.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} potential of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and MAV (Micro Air Vehicle) technology and their wide ranging applications including defence missions, reconnaissance and surveillance, border patrol, disaster zone assessment and atmospheric research. High investment levels from the military sector globally is driving {{research and development and}} increasing the viability of autonomous platforms as replacements for the remotely piloted vehicles more commonly in use. UAV/UAS pose a number of new challenges, with the autonomy and in particular collision avoidance, detect <b>and</b> <b>avoid,</b> or sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid,</b> as the most challenging one, involving both regulatory and technical issues. Sense <b>and</b> <b>Avoid</b> in UAS: Research and Applications covers the problem of detect, sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> in UAS (Unmanned Aircraft Systems) in depth and combines the theoretical and application results by leading academics and researchers from industry and academia. Key features: •Presents a holistic view of the sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> problem in the wider application of autonomous systems •Includes information on human factors, regulatory issues and navigation, control, aerodynamics and physics aspects of the sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> problem in UAS •Provides professional, scientific and reliable content that is easy to understand, and •Includes contributions from leading engineers and researchers in the field Sense <b>and</b> <b>Avoid</b> in UAS: Research and Applications is an invaluable source of original and specialised information. It acts as a reference manual for practising engineers and advanced theoretical researchers and also forms a useful resource for younger engineers and postgraduate students.

40|$|Since {{unmanned}} aircraft {{do not have}} a pilot on-board the aircraft, they cannot literally comply with the "see and avoid" requirement beyond a short distance from the location of the unmanned pilot. No performance standards are presently defined for unmanned Sense <b>and</b> <b>Avoid</b> systems, <b>and</b> the FAA has no published approval criteria for a collision avoidance system. Before the FAA can develop the necessary guidance (rules / regulations / policy) regarding the see-and-avoid requirements for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), a concise understanding of the term "equivalent level of safety" must be attained. Since this term is open to interpretation, the UAS industry and FAA need to come to an agreement on how this term can be defined and applied for a safe and acceptable collision avoidance capability for {{unmanned aircraft}}. Defining an equivalent level of safety (ELOS) for sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> {{is one of the first}} steps in understanding the requirement and developing a collision avoidance capability. This document provides a functional level definition of see-and-avoid as it applies to unmanned aircraft. The sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> ELOS definition is intended as a bridge between the see <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> requirement <b>and</b> the system level requirements for unmanned aircraft sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> systems. Sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> ELOS is defined in a rather abstract way, meaning that it is not technology or system specific, and the definition provides key parameters (and a context for those parameters) to focus the development of cooperative and non-cooperative sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> system requirements...|$|R

These creatures fed upon sediment {{at the bottom of}} ponds <b>and</b> <b>avoided</b> retracing paths they had already travelled because food would be scarce there but, because food occurred in patches, it was in the worm's interest to stay near previous trails. Different species of worm had different innate rules regarding how close to travelled paths to stay, when to turn, and how sharp a turn to make. In 1969 Raup and Seilacher created computer simulations of the fossilized worm trails, and these simulations inspired Paterson and Conway to develop a simple set of rules to study idealized worms on regular grids.|$|E

The authors showed that a large congruency effect (participants were faster to approach pleasant <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> unpleasant stimuli, than to approach unpleasant <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> pleasant stimuli) could be produced on a novel touchscreen paradigm (Experiment 1), and that the congruency effect could be reversed by spatial (Experiment 2) and nonspatial (Experiment 3) response effects.

40|$|The sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> {{capability}} {{is one of}} the greatest challenges that has to be addressed to safely integrate unmanned aircraft systems into civil and nonsegregated airspace. This paper gives a review of existing regulations, recommended practices, and standards in sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> for unmanned aircraft systems. Gaps and issues are identified, as are the different factors that are likely to affect actual sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> requirements. It is found that the operational environment (flight altitude, meteorological conditions, and class of airspace) plays an important role when determining the type of flying hazards that the unmanned aircraft system might encounter. In addition, the automation level and the data-link architecture of the unmanned aircraft system are key factors that will definitely determine the sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> system requirements. Tactical unmanned aircraft, performing similar missions to general aviation, are found to be the most challenging systems from an sense <b>and</b> <b>avoid</b> point of view, and further research and development efforts are still needed before their seamless integration into nonsegregated airspac...|$|R

5|$|After playing League cricket for Blackpool in 1939, on the {{outbreak}} of war Larwood left the game altogether, to work away from the public eye as a market gardener.

The following year Larwood became one of 26 former professional Test cricketers awarded honorary membership of the MCC. This recognition, he said, went some way to help heal the hurt he had felt over his treatment by the game's ruling body 15 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is common}} amongst spiders, both in luring prey and stealthily {{approaching}} predators. One {{case is the}} golden orb weaver (Nephila clavipes), which spins a conspicuous golden colored web in well-lit areas. Experiments show that bees are able to associate the webs with danger when the yellow pigment is not present, as occurs in less well-lit areas where the web is much harder to see. Other colors were also learned <b>and</b> <b>avoided,</b> but bees seemed least able to effectively associate yellow pigmented webs with danger. Yellow {{is the color of}} many nectar bearing flowers, however, so perhaps avoiding yellow is not worth while. Another form of mimicry is based not on color but pattern. Species such as Argiope argentata employ prominent patterns {{in the middle of their}} webs, such as zigzags. These may reflect ultraviolet light, and mimic the pattern seen in many flowers known as nectar guides. Spiders change their web day to day, which can be explained by bees' ability to remember web patterns. Bees are able to associate a certain pattern with a spatial location, meaning the spider must spin a new pattern regularly or suffer diminishing prey capture.|$|E
5|$|Alan Grant, {{a writer}} from Scotland, {{got his start}} on 2000 AD as an {{assistant}} writer for John Wagner. Grant rose to prominence as an equal of Wagner's {{in the creation of}} Judge Dredd comic strips. These stories were noted favorably for their use of socio-political commentary and satire. Together, the duo acquired employment with DC Comics. Dennis O'Neil assigned them to Detective Comics in 1988, hoping they would bring their gritty, violent take on Judge Dredd to Batman storylines. Soon after, Wagner left the company, leaving Grant to continue the run on his own. Drawing on his work for Judge Dredd, Grant began injecting social commentary into the comic book, <b>and</b> <b>avoided</b> using common Batman rogues in favor of his own creations. Some of these villains were influenced by characters from the Judge Dredd universe. Anarky was conceived singularly by Grant {{as a result of these}} circumstances, and Grant's own intellectual and philosophical meditations influenced the portrayal of the character over the following years.|$|E
