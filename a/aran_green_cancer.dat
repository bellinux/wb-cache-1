40|$|Green tea catechin {{and green}} tea extract are now {{recognized}} as non-toxic cancer preventives for humans. We first review our brief historical development of <b>green</b> tea <b>cancer</b> prevention. Based on exciting evidence that green tea catechin, (−) -epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) {{in drinking water}} inhibited lung metastasis of B 16 melanoma cells, we and other researchers have studied the inhibitory mechanisms of metastasis with green tea catechins using biomechanical tools, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and microfluidic optical stretcher. Specifically, determination of biophysical properties of cancer cells, low cell stiffness, and high deformability in relation to migration, along with biophysical effects, were studied by treatment with green tea catechins. The study with AFM revealed that low average values of Young’s moduli, indicating low cell stiffness, are closely associated with strong potential of cell migration and metastasis for various cancer cells. It {{is important to note}} that treatments with EGCG and green tea extract elevated the average values of Young’s moduli resulting in increased stiffness (large elasticity) of melanomas and various cancer cells.

40|$|The {{beneficial}} effects of tea consumption on cancer prevention have been generally reported, while (−) -Epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate (EGCG) {{is the major}} active component from <b>green</b> tea. <b>Cancer</b> stem cells (CSCs) {{play a crucial role}} in the process of cancer development. Targeting CSCs may be an effective way for cancer intervention. However, the effects of EGCG on colorectal CSCs and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Spheroid formation assay was used to enrich colorectal CSCs from colorectal cancer cell lines. Immunoblotting analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to measure the alterations of critical molecules expression. Immunofluorescence staining analysis was also used to determine the expression of CD 133. We revealed that EGCG inhibited the spheroid formation capability of colorectal cancer cells as well as the expression of colorectal CSC markers, along with suppression of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Moreover, we illustrated that EGCG downregulated the activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway, while upregulation of Wnt/β-catenin diminished the inhibitory effects of EGCG on colorectal CSCs. Taken together, this study suggested that EGCG could be an effective natural compound targeting colorectal CSCs through suppression of Wnt/β-catenin pathway, and thus may be a promising agent for colorectal cancer intervention...|$|R

The increment of mononuclear cells proliferation around breast cancer tissue represent good prognose of immune system. The purpose of this research was to prove the effect of Green Tea Polifenol mononuclear cells proliferation around breast cancer’s tissue in C 3 H mice. Methods: This experimental study applied post test only control group design. Fifteen C 3 H mices as samples were divided into 3 groups. Group K: were innoculated with cancer cells, and received standard diet. P 1 : were administrated with 0, 8 mg/day Green Tea Polifenol orally for 3 weeks, and then the mice were inoculated with cancer cells. P 2 : were innoculated with cancer cells and then 3 weeks after tumors appeared, administrated with 0, 8 mg/day Green Tea Polifenol orally Result: The highest mean of mononuclear cells proliferation’s was 1, 7 (0, 20) on P 1; 1, 3 (0, 39) on P 2 and the lowest was on 0, 9 (0, 22) on group K. There was a significant difference in mononuclear cells proliferation’s score between all groups (p= 0, 006).

40|$|Abstract Background Green tea {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{beverages}} worldwide. This review summarizes the beneficial effects of <b>green</b> tea on <b>cancer</b> prevention. Methods Electronic databases, including PubMed (1966 – 2008), the Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2008) and Chinese Biomedical Database (1978 – 2008) with supplement of relevant websites, were searched. There was no language restriction. The searches ended at March 2008. We included randomized and non-randomized clinical trials, epidemiological studies (cohort and case-control) and a meta-analysis. We excluded case series, case reports, in vitro and animal studies. Outcomes were measured with estimation of relative risk, hazard or odd ratios, with 95 % confidence interval. Results Forty-three epidemiological studies, four randomized trials and one meta-analysis were identified. The overall quality of these studies was evaluated as good or moderate. While some evidence suggests that green tea has beneficial effects on gastrointestinal cancers, the findings are not consistent. Conclusion Green tea may have beneficial effects on cancer prevention.

40|$|Green tea {{is highly}} {{effective}} in aiding in overall health if consumed {{on a daily}} basis and can reduce incidence of cardiovascular disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer. The primary compounds found in green tea are polyphenols which include catechins, epicatechin(EC), epigallocatechin(EGC), epicatechingallate(ECG), andepigallocatechingallate(EGCG). Five research studies were analyzed to verify the validity of the hypothesis that green consumption is beneficial in overall health. In these studies, green tea was found to aid in weight loss with those who consumed green tea regularly, as well as having effects on thermogenesis and fat oxidation to control wait maintenance. There was also a beneficial inverse association between green tea, coffee, and caffeine consumption and the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality rates. The EGCG in the green tea was considered to be the primary ingredient that reduced mortality rates. Green tea is known to contain powerful antioxidants that help fight off diseases such as <b>cancer.</b> <b>Green</b> tea was statistically proven to contain the highest antioxidant content compared to other teas such as black tea, oolong tea, and roasted tea (...|$|R
40|$|The cancer-preventive {{effects of}} green tea {{and its main}} {{constituent}} (-) -epigallocatechin gallate [(-) - EGCG] are widely supported by results from epidemiological, cell culture, animal and clinical studies in the recent decade. In vitro cell culture studies show that tea polyphenols potently induce apoptotic cell death and cell cycle arrest in tumor cells but not in their normal cell counterparts. Green tea polyphenols affect several signal transduction pathways, including growth factor-mediated, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) -dependent, and ubiquitin/proteasome degradation pathways. Epidemiological {{studies have suggested that}} the consumption of green tea lowers the risk of cancer. Various animal studies have revealed that treatment by green tea inhibits tumor incidence and multiplicity in different organ sites such as skin, lung, liver, stomach, mammary gland and colon.

This parametric image is interpreted by clinicians based on predominant colorization of the tumor: red indicates a suspicion of malignancy (risk of <b>cancer),</b> <b>green</b> or yellow - a high probability of benignity. In the first case (suspicion of malignant tumor), the clinician typically prescribes a biopsy to confirm the diagnostic or a CT scan examination as a second opinion. In the second case (quasi-certain of benign tumor), only a follow-up is needed with a contrast ultrasonography examination a few months later. The main clinical benefits are to avoid a systematic biopsy (risky invasive procedure) of benign tumors or a CT scan examination exposing the patient to X-ray radiation.
