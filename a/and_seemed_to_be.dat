5|$|At {{first he}} took soft clay in his bill {{from the edge}} of the water <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{smearing}} it on one leg near the knee. Then he fluttered away on one foot for a short distance <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pulling tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he worked into the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again he took some clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more till I could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen minutes, while I watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood perfectly still for a full hour under an overhanging sod, where the eye could with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay bandage with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from the brook and disappeared in the thick woods.|$|E
5|$|In 6BC, on {{the verge}} of {{accepting}} command in the East and becoming the second most powerful man in Rome, Tiberius suddenly announced his withdrawal from politics and retired to Rhodes. The precise motives for Tiberius's withdrawal are unclear. Historians have speculated a connection with the fact that Augustus had adopted Julia's sons by Agrippa Gaius and Lucius, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> moving them along the same political path that both Tiberius and Drusus had trodden.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} protect the Big Bend region, the United States {{deployed}} a number of cavalry and signalmen in various posts along the Texas border. One of these posts was at the village of Ojo de Agua which had been raided on September 3, 1915 and was the planned target of a Seditionista raid in October 1916. The American base at Ojo de Agua under the command of Sergeant Ernest Schaeffer consisted of a radio station manned by approximately ten men from Troop G, 3rd Cavalry, and eight men of the United States Army Signal Corps. The post at Ojo de Agua was lightly defended <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> little match for the 25 to 100 raiders that planned to raid the village.|$|E
5|$|On 9 July 1806, {{the small}} British brig HMS Rattlesnake under Commander John Bastard was {{cruising}} off the Southern {{coast of the}} British colony of Ceylon in search of French privateers that had been attacking small British traders, known as country ships, in the region. Most notorious of these was the Bellone, known to be operating in the area. In the early afternoon, lookouts on Rattlesnake spotted sails near the Little Basses Reef and approached the ship, which turned with the wind and fled to the southwest. Bastard immediately gave chase, and soon came close enough to identify the vessel as the Bellone. Although Bellone was {{much larger than the}} British warship, Captain Perroud was unwilling to risk his vessel in an unprofitable confrontation with Rattlesnake <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> making an effective withdrawal when, at 15:15, a large ship came within sight directly ahead.|$|E
5|$|The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, today {{known as}} DARPA) {{was formed in}} 1958 by President Dwight Eisenhower's Secretary of Defense, Neil McElroy, in {{reaction}} to Soviet rocketry advances. US efforts had suffered from massive duplication of effort between the Army, Air Force, and Navy, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> accomplishing little {{in comparison to the}} Soviets. ARPA was initially handed the mission of overseeing all of these efforts. As the problems with Zeus became clear, McElroy also asked ARPA to consider the antimissile problem and come up with other solutions. The resulting Project Defender was extremely broad in scope, considering everything from minor Zeus system upgrades to far-out concepts like antigravity and the recently invented laser.|$|E

5|$|The 1995 Brazilian Grand Prix (formally the XXIV Grande Prêmio do Brasil) was a Formula One motor race held on 26 March 1995 at the Autódromo José Carlos Pace, São Paulo, Brazil. It was the firstround of the 1995 Formula One season. The 71-lap {{race was}} won by Michael Schumacher for the Benetton team after {{starting}} from second position. David Coulthard {{finished second in}} a Williams, with Gerhard Berger third in a Ferrari. Damon Hill, who started the race from pole position, spun out while leading on lap30 with an apparent gearbox problem, which was later {{found to be a}} suspension failure. Schumacher's win came despite Benetton encountering steering problems with his car during Friday practice, leading to him crashing heavily and necessitating steering component changes {{for the rest of the}} event. Despite Schumacher's victory, Hill proved to be faster during the race, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on course for a comfortable victory before his sudden retirement.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} year with the Lakers under new coach Joe Mullaney, Chamberlain seriously injured his knee. He was injured in the ninth game of the schedule, {{suffering}} a total rupture of the patellar tendon {{at the base of}} his right kneecap, and missed the next several months before appearing in the final three games of the 82-game regular season. Owing to a great start, he managed to average 27.3 points, 18.4 rebounds and 4.1 assists per game. Again, the Lakers charged through the playoffs, and in the 1970 NBA Finals, the Lakers were pitted against the New York Knicks, loaded with future Hall-of-Famers Willis Reed, Dave DeBusschere, Bill Bradley, and Walt Frazier. Cherry observed that Reed, a prolific midrange shooter, was a bad matchup for Chamberlain: having lost lateral quickness due to his injury, the Lakers center was often too slow to block Reed's preferred high post jump shots. In Game 1, New York masterminded a 124–112 win in which Reed scored 37 points. In Game 2, Chamberlain scored 19 points, grabbed 24 rebounds, and blocked Reed's shot in the final seconds, leading the Lakers to a 105–103 win. Game 3 saw Jerry West famously hit a 60-foot shot at the buzzer to tie the game at 102; however, the Knicks took the game 111–108. In Game 4, Chamberlain scored 18 points and grabbed 25 rebounds and helped tie the series at 2. In Game 5, with the Knicks trailing by double digits, Reed pulled his thigh muscle <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done for the series. By conventional wisdom, Chamberlain now should have dominated against little-used Knicks backup centers Nate Bowman and Bill Hosket or forwards Bradley and DeBusschere, who gave up more than half a foot against the Lakers center. Instead, the Lakers gave away their 13-point halftime lead and succumbed to the aggressive Knicks defense: L.A. committed 19 second half turnovers, and the two main scorers Chamberlain and West shot the ball only three and two times, respectively, in the entire second half. The Lakers lost 107–100 in what was called one of the greatest comebacks in NBA Finals history. In Game 6, Chamberlain scored 45 points, grabbed 27 rebounds and almost single-handedly equalized the series in a 135–113 Lakers win, and with Reed out, the Knicks seemed doomed prior to Game 7 in New York.|$|E

25|$|By 1768, {{the rapid}} growth of Glasgow had vastly {{increased}} the demand for coal, and its price: several bodies expressed concern, and the magistrates of Glasgow took action. The Lord Provost was James Buchanan of Drumpellier, and the rich Monklands coalfield was practically untapped. Canals were being promoted all over the country, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the obvious solution here; the magistrates commissioned James Watt to recommend a route.|$|E

25|$|In {{the twelfth}} stage, Heusghem {{attacked}} Alavoine again. Alavoine punctured {{six times in}} that stage, which {{made it impossible for}} him to keep up with Heusghem. Heusghem won over 35 minutes on Alavoine, and more than 10 minutes on second-placed Lambot, which was enough to take over the lead. Heusghem was at that point the strongest rider in the race, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{on the way to the}} overall victory in Paris.|$|E
25|$|Egypt's President Mubarak {{was already}} lashing out at American arrogance and Italy's {{assistance}} in the affair.

The Egyptian populace was irate at the American action, Craxi worried that if the U.S. wound up with Abbas an outraged Egyptian populace might turn against Mubarak for caving {{in the face of}} pressure.|$|E
25|$|After 1930, Longrigg's {{career as}} a {{solicitor}} in Bath in the family business increasingly took him away from cricket. In the 1931, 1932 and 1933 seasons he played 12 matches in each season; that tailed off until in 1936 he played only four times. He played more often in home matches than away, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> available most often in the cricket festival at Bath, where he made at least one appearance every season except 1936.|$|E

25|$|Nationally, President Grant {{was blamed}} for the depression; the Republican Party lost 96 seats {{in all parts of}} the country in the 1874 elections. The Bourbon Democrats took control of the House and were {{confident}} of electing Samuel J. Tilden president in 1876. President Grant was not running for re-election <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> losing interest in the South. States fell to the Redeemers, with only four in Republican hands in 1873, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina; Arkansas then fell after the violent Brooks–Baxter War in 1874 ripped apart the Republican party there.|$|E
25|$|There was a moral {{elevation}} in Cousin's spiritual philosophy which {{touched the}} hearts of his listeners, <b>and</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the basis for higher development in national literature and art, and even in politics, than the traditional philosophy of France. His lectures produced more ardent disciples than those of any other contemporary professor of philosophy. Judged on his teaching influence, Cousin occupies a foremost place in the rank of professors of philosophy, who like Jacobi, Schelling and Dugald Stewart have united the gifts of speculative, expository and imaginative power. The taste for philosophy—especially its history—was revived in France to an extent unknown since the 17th century.|$|E
