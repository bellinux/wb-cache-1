5|$|Crosses that precede an {{offensive}} bicycle kick are of dubious accuracy—German striker Klaus Fischer reportedly stated that most crosses {{prior to a}} bicycle kick are bad. Moreover, performing a bicycle kick is dangerous, even when done correctly, as it may harm <b>a</b> <b>startled</b> participant in the field. For this reason, Peruvian defender César González recommends that the player executing the bicycle kick have enough space to perform it. For the player using the manoeuvre, the greatest danger happens during the drop; a bad fall can injure the head, back, or wrist. Witzig recommends players attempting the move to land on their upper back, using their arms as support, and simultaneously rolling over to a side in order to diminish impact from the drop. A poor bicycle kick can also expose a player to ridicule.|$|E
25|$|The film's villain, Freddy Krueger, draws {{heavily from}} Craven's early life. One night, a young Craven saw {{an elderly man}} walking on the sidepath outside {{the window of his}} home. The man stopped to glance at <b>a</b> <b>startled</b> Craven and walked off. This served as the {{inspiration}} for Krueger. Initially, Fred Krueger was intended to be a child molester, but Craven eventually characterized him as a child murderer to avoid being accused of exploiting a spate of highly publicized child molestation cases that occurred in California around the time of production of the film.|$|E

500|$|Curious and unaggressive, the short-tail {{stingray}} may approach {{humans and}} can be trained to be hand-fed. [...] At Hamelin Bay in Western Australia, many short-tail stingrays, thorntail stingrays (D. thetidis), and Australian bull rays (Myliobatis australis) regularly gather to be hand-fed fish scraps; {{the number of visitors}} has steadily increased in recent years, and there is interest in developing the site as a permanent tourist attraction. However, if startled or harassed this species is capable of inflicting a serious, even fatal wound with its sting. The sting can measure over [...] long and penetrate most types of footwear, including kevlar bootees; its mucous sheath contains a toxin that causes necrosis. The most dangerous injuries involve damage to a vital organ, massive blood loss, and/or secondary septicemia or tetanus. There have been cases where <b>a</b> <b>startled</b> ray had jumped {{out of the water and}} pierced a wader's chest cavity. This species is responsible for the majority of stingray injuries off New Zealand.|$|E
500|$|The Sue storyline {{garnered}} many unfavorable reviews. Reiter criticized her inconsistent characterization, {{which made}} her actions seem [...] "like fragments pasted {{together to form a}} disjointed collage." [...] While VanDerWerff was more favorable, he wrote that Sue's jokes about committing [...] "Sue-icide" [...] were [...] "neither dark enough to provoke <b>a</b> <b>startled</b> burst or laughter nor funny enough to overcome their central tastelessness", and called the scene in the pediatric oncology ward [...] "woefully misjudged and inappropriately hilarious." [...] The Atlantic Meghan Brown found the use of seriously ill children [...] "borderline offensive", and called Sue's suicide attempt [...] "in totally bad taste". Miriam Krule of NPR felt that Glee treated suicide too lightly, and in doing so sent a mixed message to its youth audience. Poniewozik wrote that Sue has become [...] "a burden on the show", and described her as [...] "a breakout character who's broken out of the constraints of recognizable character." [...] He questioned the point of her arc, and suggested that the attempt at humanizing her was redundant, as viewers already know Sue to be capable of compassion.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of season two, Michael and Sawyer are stranded {{in the middle of}} the ocean, with Jin missing. They wash ashore and discover Jin, then are knocked unconscious by one of the survivors from the tail section of the plane. After convincing the tail section survivors that they were on the same plane, they all return to the beach camp of the fuselage survivors. Later, Michael offers to take a shift in the [...] that the survivors have found. Here, he begins receiving computer messages from someone who he thinks is Walt, who gives him directions to where he is being held. Michael ventures off in search of him, but moments after leaving the camp, two of the Others kidnap him and hold him hostage. Michael is told to retrieve their leader, who is held captive in the hatch, then bring Sawyer, Kate (Evangeline Lilly), Jack (Matthew Fox) and Hurley (Jorge Garcia) to them, and they will return Walt and let them leave the Island. In order to free their leader, Ben (Michael Emerson), Michael convinces Ana Lucia (Michelle Rodriguez), who is guarding Ben, that he will kill Ben on her behalf, but instead kills her when she hands over the gun and the combination to the armory. When Libby (Cynthia Watros) walks in on them, <b>a</b> <b>startled</b> Michael shoots her twice. He succeeds in bringing the four requested survivors to the Others, so Ben reunites him with Walt. Michael and Walt are given a boat and coordinates to freedom, and they sail away from the Island.|$|E

2500|$|Howard has an {{irritable}} {{and cynical}} attitude to the often bizarre events around him; he feels {{there is nothing}} special about him except {{that he is a}} duck, and though he has no goals other than seeking comfort and to be left alone, he is often dragged into dangerous adventures simply because he is visibly unusual. His series' tagline, [...] "Trapped in a world he never made", played off the genre trappings of 1950s science fiction.

Researchers also {{concluded that}} the witnesses' inability to agree on whether the creature had arms, combined with Kathleen May's report of it having [...] "small, claw-like hands" [...] which [...] "extended in front of it", also matched the description of a barn owl with its talons gripping a tree branch.|$|E
2500|$|It was at Isandhlwana {{that the}} main force materialized undetected to {{liquidate}} their enemies.

Johnson, Secretary of Defense, sent Jolson a telegram. 'Sorry for delay but regret no funds for entertainment – STOP; USO disbanded – STOP.' The message was as much an assault on the Jolson sense of patriotism as the actual crossing of the 38th Parallel had been. 'What are they talkin' about', he thundered. 'Funds? Who needs funds?

2500|$|Critical {{reception}} in the United States was also largely positive following PBS' {{acquisition of the}} show. Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times labelled the series as [...] "the best new show of the fall" [...] describing it as [...] "a rapturous mix of absurdly fairy-tale-romance and frantic modern complications, set in the picturesque drear of Yorkshire and brought to life by masterfully shaded performances." [...] She opined that Reid and Jacobi [...] "are capable of doing more with <b>a</b> <b>startled</b> look or careful smile... than most actors can do in seven pages of dialogue". Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe acknowledged that the public might not find the series appealing based on its title and premise alone, stating that PBS' description of the programme made it sound [...] "as saccharine and hackneyed as a Geritol commercial". Upon viewing the series however, he praised the added dimensions of the series and wrote that it was [...] "so much more interesting" [...] than the central premise suggested. He also felt that Walker and Lancashire played an important part; [...] "both add a necessary amount of bitter to the sweet". Mike Hale of The New York Times was more cynical about the series, describing it as a [...] "warm comforter of a series" [...] and [...] "treacle". However he felt that series also distinguished itself from this category of media by its [...] "relatively dry style and careful modulation of tone and volume" [...] in addition to [...] "a crackerjack cast".|$|E
2500|$|The loss of Attu placed American {{forces in}} between Paramushiro and Kiska, {{allowing}} them to blockade Kiska. United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) aircraft soon began to operate from Attu; USAAF aircraft staging through Attu even made the first airstrike against Paramushiro on 18 July 1943, causing <b>a</b> <b>startled</b> Kawase to wheel his office chair to a window {{to see what was}} happening after a string of bombs detonated on a taxiway. The USAAF aircraft on Attu strengthened the blockade of Kiska and made it impossible for Kawase to send supplies or reinforcements to Kiska in surface ships; only his submarine force made resupply runs there, completing 20 such trips by 9 June 1943. Imperial General Headquarters wanted the Kiska garrison withdrawn so that its troops could be employed in the defense of the Kurile Islands, and ordered Kawase to use his submarines to evacuate them. The pace of American operations in the Aleutians suggested that the Allies would invade Kiska by late July 1943, and Kawase doubted that his submarine force [...] originally 13 submarines, but reduced to eight thanks to combat losses since the Battle of Attu began [...] could complete the 40 to 50 trips necessary to complete an evacuation by then. By 21 June, when Kawase ordered an end to the submarine evacuation operations, the 5th Fleet had lost three more submarines, and Japanese submarines had managed to evacuate only 820 troops, of whom 300 had died in the sinking of the submarines carrying them.|$|E
