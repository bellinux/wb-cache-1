Myasthenia gravis, too, may happen {{in the presence of}} tumors (thymoma, <b>a</b> <b>tumor</b> of the thymus in the chest); people with MG without <b>a</b> <b>tumor</b> and people with LEMS without <b>a</b> <b>tumor</b> have similar genetic variations that seem to predispose them to these diseases. HLA-DR3-B8 (an HLA subtype), in particular, seems to predispose to LEMS.|$|E
5|$|Unless the {{pituitary}} {{damage is}} being caused by <b>a</b> <b>tumor</b> that overproduces a particular hormone, {{it is the}} lack of pituitary hormones that leads to the symptoms described above, and an excess of a particular hormone would indicate the presence of <b>a</b> <b>tumor.</b> The exception to this rule is prolactin: if <b>a</b> <b>tumor</b> compresses the pituitary stalk, a decreased blood supply means that the lactotrope cells, which produce prolactin, are not receiving dopamine and therefore produce excess prolactin. Hence, mild elevations in prolactin are attributed to stalk compression. Very high prolactin levels, though, point more strongly towards a prolactinoma (prolactin-secreting tumor).|$|E

5|$|Hormonal {{therapy is}} only {{beneficial}} in {{certain types of}} endometrial cancer. It was {{once thought to be}} beneficial in most cases. If <b>a</b> <b>tumor</b> is well-differentiated and known to have progesterone and estrogen receptors, progestins may be used in treatment. About 25% of metastatic endometrioid cancers show a response to progestins. Also, endometrial stromal sarcomas can be treated with hormonal agents, including tamoxifen, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, letrozole, megestrol acetate, and medroxyprogesterone. This treatment is effective in endometrial stromal sarcomas because they typically have estrogen and/or progestin receptors. Progestin receptors function as tumor suppressors in endometrial cancer cells. Preliminary research and clinical trials have shown these treatments to have a high rate of response even in metastatic disease.|$|E
