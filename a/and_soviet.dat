5|$|Germany {{had been}} de facto divided, and two {{independent}} states, the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic were created within {{the borders of}} Allied <b>and</b> <b>Soviet</b> occupation zones, accordingly. The rest of Europe was also divided into Western <b>and</b> <b>Soviet</b> spheres of influence. Most eastern and central European countries fell into the Soviet sphere, which led to establishment of Communist-led regimes, with full or partial support of the Soviet occupation authorities. As a result, East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Albania became Soviet satellite states. Communist Yugoslavia conducted a fully independent policy, causing tension with the USSR.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{economist}} Zdzisław Sadowski, the Poles were generally euphoric {{about the end}} of the era of communist rule <b>and</b> <b>Soviet</b> domination. Because of the belief that the Balcerowicz Plan would quickly result in universal Western-like prosperity, the plan enjoyed broad social support, which would cause any conceivable competing pursuits of more moderate economic policies to be politically unrealistic.|$|E

50|$|In an {{interlude}} set in China, it is disclosed {{how badly}} Comrade Li's miscalculated in his nefarious plan. While the Americans <b>and</b> <b>Soviets</b> did destroy each other, {{that did not}} leave China free to claim the world; rather, both Americans <b>and</b> <b>Soviets</b> reserved some of their missiles for China, enough to completely destroy it. Comrade Li meets a suitable gruesome and ignominious end at the vengeful hands of a band of surviving Chinese soldiers.|$|R

5|$|Because the Home Army was {{loyal to}} the Polish Government-in-Exile, the Soviet Union saw it as an {{obstacle}} to a Soviet takeover of Poland. Consequently, {{over the course of the}} war, conflict grew between the Home Army <b>and</b> <b>Soviet</b> forces.|$|E

On {{the way to}} his briefing, Bond escapes an ambush by Soviet agents in Austria, killing their leader during a downhill ski chase. The plans for a highly advanced submarine tracking system are being offered in Egypt. There, he encounters Major Anya Amasova—KGB agent Triple X—his rival to recover the microfilm plans. They travel across Egypt together, encountering Jaws – a tall assassin with razor sharp steel teeth – along the way. Bond and Amasova reluctantly join forces after a truce is agreed by their respective British <b>and</b> <b>Soviet</b> superiors. They identify the person responsible for the thefts as the shipping tycoon and scientist Karl Stromberg.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the success}} of the Summit Series in 1972, a series of {{exhibition}} games between NHL <b>and</b> <b>Soviet</b> league clubs known as the Super Series was launched. On New Year's Eve 1975, the Canadiens met the Soviet Red Army in a game that is considered {{to be one of the}} greatest ever played. A contest between the two greatest hockey teams in the world, the match ended in a 3–3 draw following Soviet goaltender Vladislav Tretiak's 35-save performance.|$|E
5|$|German {{forces in}} the area had been further split up, as German general Erich von Manstein was given command of the newly created Army Group Don, {{comprising}} the German Fourth Panzer and Sixth Armies, and the Third and Fourth Romanian Armies.

5|$|In October 1977, the {{original}} {{parties to the}} PTBT renewed discussion of a comprehensive test ban in Geneva.

However, the sides remained at odds over the precise details of verification and talks would permanently disband with the departure of President Jimmy Carter in 1981.|$|E

5|$|In modern Polish historiography the battle's {{outcome is}} seen as a victory, if a very costly one, for the Polish <b>and</b> <b>Soviet</b> troops. As noted by historians such as Wawer and Komorowski, despite the heavy casualties, the Polish–Soviet {{frontline}} was not seriously breached, and thus the German offensive was a failure.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the occupation, the Allies {{controlled}} traffic between the zones to manage the flow of refugees and prevent the escape of former Nazi officials and intelligence officers. These controls were gradually lifted in the Western zones, but were tightened between Western <b>and</b> <b>Soviet</b> zones in 1946 to stem a flow of economic and political refugees from the Soviet zone. Between October 1945 and June 1946, 1.6million Germans left the Soviet zone for the west.|$|E
5|$|It must {{be taken}} into account that Soviet T-26 was one the most modern tanks of the world when it arrived to Spain, <b>and</b> <b>Soviet</b> Army tank {{doctrine}} was really advanced. Unfortunately for the Spanish Government during these years Stalin decided to eliminate all those generals that supported modern tank warfare and sent to Spain the officers that he liked. This meant Soviet tanks potential was never exploited in Spain as it could.|$|E
