25|$|In {{the poem}} Lalla Radha and the Churel, a priest warns the protagonist to not go near the Peepul trees {{because that is}} where the Churel lives <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> take him away and kill him. He still went to the Peepul tree and she called out to him in a sweet tone and seduced him until he went to her. Blinded by his desire, he did not notice that while he lay with her, his body seemed to get frailer until he died in a state of ecstasy. In The Female Element in Indian Culture, it says, “The Churel runs after and seeks to possess every man whom she meets, for, it is said, her carnal {{appetite}} remains unsatisfied in life”. She also possesses girls during dances, causing a trance. According to Persian legend, when travelers saw the tracks of a Churel in the dirt they would try to flee by heading in the opposite direction, but her reversed feet would inevitably lead them right into her grasp. The Patari and Majhwar think that she appears to take her victims to the mountains and {{the only way they can}} be freed is if a goat is sacrificed.|$|E
500|$|Delays in the {{shooting}} schedule pushed filming into the autumn, which required the set decorators to spray-paint the autumn leaves green. The uncooperative weather then took a different turn, plunging from oppressive heat to down near , causing frigid conditions for the famous swimming scene in October. The crew wore warm coats, gloves, and boots. Swayze and Grey stripped down to light summer clothing, to repeatedly dive into the cold water. Despite her character's enjoyment, Grey later described the water as [...] "horrifically" [...] cold, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> not have gone into the lake, except that she was [...] "young and hungry".|$|E
500|$|Jeff Kaplan has {{commented on}} her harassing {{gameplay}} style, noting that: [...] characters like Tracer and Genji ... {{who are really}} unique in how Overwatch is played, and sometimes the absolute right thing for Tracer to be doing is to be off on her own, completely away from the objective or completely away from the team, harassing other players who are running back from the spawn. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> not even be killing those players [...] She's a distracting, ambushing skirmisher. And that doesn't really fit in necessarily with objective time. [...] You can be the absolute MVP of the match when you're doing some of those things, and there's no way to really score it accurately.|$|E

She hires Shawn Spencer (James Roday) and Burton [...] "Gus" [...] Guster (Dulé Hill) to find the money her husband and the men stole and lost. While Shawn and Gus meet with Raylene and her family, Lassiter and Juliet follow the bank robbers, {{in the hope that}} they will lead the police to the money. After conducting a séance in the Psych office, Shawn and Gus visit the cemetery where the husband, David Wilcroft (Steve Bacic) is buried. Shawn and Gus find David alive and well at the cemetery, where he tells them that he faked his death after he accidentally lost the money. He, like his partners, has been searching for the money.|$|E
2500|$|The {{timing was}} unfortunate for the Hutchinsons' {{settlement}} in this area. Animosity had grown between the Dutch and the Siwanoy Indians of New Netherland. Hutchinson had a favorable {{relationship with the}} Narragansetts in Rhode Island, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have felt {{a false sense of}} safety among the Siwanoys. However, these Indians rampaged through the New Netherland colony in a series of incidents known as Kieft's War, and a group of warriors entered the small settlement above Pelham Bay in late August 1643 and killed every member of the Hutchinson household, except for Hutchinson's nine-year-old daughter Susanna.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a journal}} entry {{written in the}} 1970s, Oates sarcastically {{addressed}} her critics, writing, [...] "So many books! so many! Obviously JCO has a full career behind her, if one chooses {{to look at it}} that way; many more titles <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> as well... what?...give up all hopes for a 'reputation'? [...] but I work hard, and long, and as the hours roll by I seem to create more than I anticipate; more, certainly, than the literary world allows for a 'serious' writer. Yet I have more stories to tell, and more novels [...] ". In The New York Review of Books in 2007, Michael Dirda suggested that disparaging criticism of Oates [...] "derives from reviewer's angst: How does one judge a new book by Oates when one is not familiar with most of the backlist? Where does one start?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{case was}} {{something}} of a cause célèbre and attracted considerable newspaper coverage {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic. [...] Arsenic was then regarded by some men as an aphrodisiac and tonic, and James Maybrick had certainly taken it on a regular basis. A city chemist confirmed that he had supplied Maybrick with quantities of the poison over a lengthy period and a search of Battlecrease House later turned up enough to kill at least fifty people. Although her marriage was clearly over in all but name, Florence had little motive to murder her husband. The financial provision Maybrick had made for her and his children in his will was paltry <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have been far better off with him alive but legally separated from her. Many people held the view that Florence had indeed poisoned her husband because he was about to divorce her which, in Victorian society, would see her ruined. An even more compelling motive might have been the prospect of losing the custody of her beloved children.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{reported}} that in late November 2012, Kat's lover would [...] "turn stalker", with Inside Soap saying that [...] "there {{is no way that}} the mystery man is letting her get away so easily [...] That's proved when he ups his game to get Kat to meet with him at their lovenest". An insider told the magazine that Kat's man is [...] "persistent, ruthless and utterly fixated on her. This could be a very dangerous game for Kat to play. Might the man who loves her completely destroy her life?" [...] It was also reported in November that Derek would be killed off from the series at Christmas, and it was speculated that he would be murdered. Alfie and Kat were both named as suspects, amongst many others, with Soaplife saying that if Derek is Kat's lover, he might turn violent if she continues to reject him <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be forced to kill him, or Alfie might find out that Derek is Kat's lover and murder him in revenge, referring back to Richie's reminders that Alfie had been in jail and would want to harm Kat's lover. In fact, Alfie quickly became the favourite with bookmakers William Hill.|$|E
2500|$|Born This Way was {{included}} in several year-end lists by music critics and publications. Rolling Stone magazine, in their list of the [...] "50 Best Albums of 2011", ranked it at sixth place, writing [...] "none of Gaga's previous exercises in musical plussizing prepared us {{for this kind of}} anything-goes extravagance". The Guardian, in their list of the best albums of 2011, listed Born This Way at 31st. Slant Magazine ranked the album as the third best of 2011 in their list of [...] "The 25 Best Albums of 2011", calling it a [...] "magnum opus", and describing it as a [...] "sincere ode to the bedazzled hearts of outsiders past and present". Furthermore, MTV ranked it as the tenth best album of 2011, claiming it is the [...] "first multi-national, multi-hyphenate, multi-sexual pop album of our time", and called it [...] "her grandest mission statement to date".
