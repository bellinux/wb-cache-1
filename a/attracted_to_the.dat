5|$|A {{variety of}} pollinators have been {{recorded}} visiting the flower spikes, including New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), native and European honey bees, wasps and ants.

Being upside down may facilitate this process.|$|E

40|$|We {{typically}} observe large-scale {{outcomes that}} arise from the interactions of many hidden, small-scale processes. Examples include age of disease onset, rates of amino acid substitutions and composition of ecological communities. The macroscopic patterns in each problem often vary around a characteristic shape that can be generated by neutral processes. A neutral generative model assumes that each microscopic process follows unbiased or random stochastic fluctuations: random connections of network nodes; amino acid substitutions with no effect on fitness; species that arise or disappear from communities randomly. These neutral generative models often match common patterns of nature. In this paper, I present the theoretical background by which we can understand why these neutral generative models are so successful. I show where the classic patterns come from, such as the Poisson pattern, the normal or Gaussian pattern and many others. Each classic pattern was often discovered by a simple neutral generative model. The neutral patterns share a special characteristic: they describe the patterns of nature that follow from simple constraints on information. For example, any aggregation of processes that preserves information only about the mean and variance <b>attracts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gaussian pattern; any aggregation that preserves information only about <b>the</b> mean <b>attracts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> exponential pattern; any aggregation that preserves information only about <b>the</b> geometric mean <b>attracts</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> power law pattern. I present a simple and consistent informational framework of the common patterns of nature based on the method of maximum entropy. This framework shows that each neutral generative model is a special case that helps to discover {{a particular set of}} informational constraints; those informational constraints define a much wider domain of non-neutral generative processes that <b>attract</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same neutral pattern...|$|R

5|$|A {{trend of}} {{decreasing}} electron affinity going down groups would be expected. The additional electron will be entering an orbital {{farther away from}} the nucleus. As such this electron would be less <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nucleus and would release less energy when added. However, in going down a group, around one-third of elements are anomalous, with heavier elements having higher electron affinities than their next lighter congenors. Largely, {{this is due to the}} poor shielding by d and f electrons. A uniform decrease in electron affinity only applies to group 1 atoms.|$|E

Even giving silent assent or endorsement to acts of violence from far away has karmic consequences for the soul. Hence, the scriptures advise carefulness in actions, awareness of the world, and purity in thoughts as means to avoid the burden of karma.|$|E

5|$|Bulls have a loud vocalization {{consisting}} of screams known as bugling, {{which can be}} heard for miles. Bugling {{is often associated with}} an adaptation to open environments such as parklands, meadows, and savannas, where sound can travel great distances. Females are <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> males that bugle more often and have the loudest call. Bugling is most common early and late in the day {{and is one of the}} most distinctive sounds in nature, akin to the howl of the gray wolf.|$|E
5|$|Electronegativity is a {{chemical}} property {{that describes the}} tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself. If the bond between sodium and chlorine in sodium chloride were covalent, the pair of shared electrons would be <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium. The electron pair is attracted {{so close to the}} chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom (an ionic bond). However, if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom, the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller, making the electron pair more strongly <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> closer effective nuclear charge from lithium. Hence, the larger alkali metal atoms (further down the group) will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them. As mentioned previously, francium is expected to be an exception.|$|E
5|$|Franklin {{was first}} <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> study of {{electricity}} {{when he saw}} the showman Archibald Spencer do magic demonstrations in Boston (1743) and in Philadelphia (1744). He purchased Spencer's equipment and used it for his electricity experiments after these demonstrations were completed. He referred to Spencer as Dr. Spence from Scotland. In 1746, at the age of forty years, Franklin began turning over the affairs of his printing company to his business partner David Hall, and went into semi-retirement so he could carry out research on electricity; initially using Spencer's equipment.|$|E
