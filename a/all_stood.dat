5|$|The Doctor {{comes to}} the end of the {{transcript}} and Sally realises Larry has stopped writing it due to the presence of an Angel in the room. The Doctor, surmising their fate, warns them not even to blink around the Angels. Sally and Larry make their way to the basement of the house and discover more Angels guarding the TARDIS. The Angels attack and Sally and Larry use the Yale key to hide inside the TARDIS. The Angels surround and rock the TARDIS to try to gain entry. Once in the control room, a hologram of the Doctor informs them that they have a control disk with them. Larry takes a now-glowing DVD from his pocket and inserts it into the console. The TARDIS' engines engage and the ship dematerialises, leaving a panicking Sally and Larry behind. With the TARDIS gone, the Angels who were <b>all</b> <b>stood</b> around the TARDIS have been tricked into looking at each other and have become permanently frozen as statues.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} pioneer days of Western Canada's prairie towns, when a good farming spot being settled, many {{people wanted to}} make money by {{building}} their own grain elevators. This brought in droves of private grain companies. Towns boasted dozens of elevator companies which <b>all</b> <b>stood</b> in a row along the railway tracks. If a town {{was lucky enough to}} have two railways, it was {{to be known as the}} next Montreal. In many elevator rows there would be two or more elevators of the same company. Small towns bragged of their large elevator rows in promotional pamphlets to attract settlers. With so much competition in the 1920s, consolidation began almost immediately, and many small companies were merged or absorbed into larger companies.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{the three}} companies, all {{competing}} for passengers between Åland Islands and Sweden, realised that they {{in the long}} run <b>all</b> <b>stood</b> to lose from mutual competition. In 1965 Vikinglinjen and Slite began collaborating, and in the end of July 1966 Viking Line was established as a marketing company for all three companies. At this time Rederi Ab Vikinglinjen changed their name to Rederi Ab Solstad, in order to avoid confusion with the marketing company. The red hull livery was adopted from Slite's Ålandspilen service (to which it had been taken from the colour of the chairman's wife's lipstick!). In 1967 Rederi Ab Ålandsfärjan changed its name to SF Line and in 1977 Rederi Ab Solstad was merged into its mother company Rederi Ab Sally.|$|E

[...] Each team was represented by a delegate, and the meeting was chaired by IIHF President Günther Sabetzki. [...] The delegates voted 7–1 in favour of ejecting both teams from the tournament, the lone dissenting vote being that of Canada's Dennis McDonald. McDonald was incensed by the voting: Finland, Czechoslovakia and Sweden <b>all</b> <b>stood</b> to gain medal position by voting the two teams out, the Americans only promised support if other nations supported Canada, and Sabetzki could barely control his disdain for the Canadians.|$|E
500|$|The first {{election}} to the Shadow Cabinet that took place under Miliband's leadership was on 7 October 2010.

The three other defeated candidates for the Labour leadership <b>all</b> <b>stood</b> in the election, though Diane Abbott failed to win enough votes to gain a place. Following the election, Miliband unveiled his Shadow Cabinet on 8 October 2010. Among others he appointed Alan Johnson as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, Yvette Cooper was chosen as Shadow Foreign Secretary, and both defeated Labour leadership candidates Ed Balls and Andy Burnham were given senior roles, becoming Shadow Home Secretary and Shadow Education Secretary respectively. Burnham was also given responsibility for overseeing Labour's election co-ordination.|$|E

In 1841, William Watson Waldron of Trinity College, Dublin, in Ireland, published Pocahontas, American Princess: and Other Poems, calling Pocahontas [...] "the beloved and only surviving daughter of the king". Indeed, Pocahontas was a favorite of her father's—his [...] "delight and darling", according to the colonist Captain Ralph Hamor—but she was not in line to inherit a position as a weroance, subchief, or mamanatowick (paramount chief).

In the run-up to the law's ratification, state media in the PRC accused those in Taiwan in favour of Taiwan independence of creating hostility to the new law and of confusing the Taiwanese into thinking that the law had hostile intent. [...] Prior to passing the law, Hu Jintao in a speech outlined a four-point guideline to resolving the issue.|$|E

2500|$|One {{important}} {{place for the}} exchange of ideas was the salon. The word salon first appeared in France in 1664 (from the Italian word salone, itself from sala, the large reception hall of Italian mansions). [...] Literary gatherings before this were often referred to by using {{the name of the}} room in which they occurred, like cabinet, réduit, ruelle and alcôve. [...] Before the end of the 17th century, these gatherings were frequently held in the bedroom (treated as a more private form of drawing room): a lady, reclining on her bed, would receive close friends who would sit on chairs or stools drawn around. This practice may be contrasted with the greater formalities of Louis XIV's petit lever, where <b>all</b> <b>stood.</b> Ruelle, literally meaning [...] "narrow street" [...] or [...] "lane", designates the space between a bed and the wall in a bedroom; it was used commonly to designate the gatherings of the [...] "précieuses", the intellectual and literary circles that formed around women {{in the first half of}} the 17th century. The first renowned salon in France was the Hôtel de Rambouillet not far from the Palais du Louvre in Paris, which its hostess, Roman-born Catherine de Vivonne, marquise de Rambouillet (1588–1665), ran from 1607 until her death. She established the rules of etiquette of the salon which resembled the earlier codes of Italian chivalry.|$|E

2500|$|Floodway Park, {{bounded by}} North Main Street, Station Street, the Center Township boundary, and Yellow Creek, is a multi-use {{recreational}} site maintained by Homer-Center Parks and Recreation. [...] It offers visitors two softball fields with bleachers, a pavilion with electricity, a walking trail, restroom facilities, parking for events {{and serves as}} a [...] "trailhead" [...] for the Hoodlebug Trail. [...] Its name speaks volumes about the history of this section of the borough and the origins of the park itself. [...] It is located on a natural flood plain adjacent to Yellow Creek Park, and it represents [...] a different approach to land use: it can be developed and used on a regular basis, but in ways that do not profoundly inhibit the flood plain nor will structures built on the plain be ruined should severe flooding occur. [...] Prior to the Flood of '77 the area was an extension of the Main Street/Downtown Business District. [...] C. S. Kunkle Lumber, Sesti's Restaurant, the Colonial Hotel, and the original location of Luther Ford Sales at one point <b>all</b> <b>stood</b> where the park is now found. [...] (A residential neighborhood was located behind the businesses, too. [...] On {{the opposite side of the}} creek the Empire - later Homer City - Theater dating to 1913 was another prominent structure.) [...] The entire area was decimated by the Flood of 1977 with clean-up and restoration of the landscape lasting into the 1980s and the dedication of the park in the early 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the help}} of the referendum, Bartlett was able to {{introduce}} a bill to Congress. The bill, however, was immediately shot down by a coalition of Democrats and Republicans. [...] (Republicans feared that Alaska would be unable to raise enough taxes due to its small population, and end up as a welfare state. The Southern Democrats feared more pro-civil rights congressmen.) [...] To retaliate, Gruening established the [...] "Alaska Statehood Committee" [...] in 1949. He encouraged journalists, newspaper editors, politicians, and members of national and labor organizations to help use their positions and power to make the issue of Alaskan statehood more known. He gathered a group of 100 prominent figures, including Eleanor Roosevelt, actor James Cagney, Pearl S. Buck, John Gunther, historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. and Reinhold Niebuhr, who <b>all</b> <b>stood</b> for the Alaskan cause. Another bill was introduced to Congress in 1949 and passed in the House by a 186 to 146 vote in 1950. However, the bill was then shot down in the Senate, again for fear of adding more Democrats to the 81st Congress (1949–1951) Democrat (54 seats) Republican (42 seats). On February 27, 1952, the Senate by a one-vote margin (45-44) killed the statehood bill for another year. Southern Democrats had threatened a filibuster to delay consideration. [...] In the 1954 State of the Union address, Eisenhower referred to statehood for Hawaii (then a Republican territory) but not Alaska (then a Democratic territory). By March, frustrated by Eisenhower's refusal to support statehood for Alaska, a Senate coalition led by Democrats tied the fates of Alaska and Hawaii statehood together as one package. The procedural move was backed by some Southern Democrats, concerned about the addition of new votes in the civil rights for blacks movement, in the hope of defeating both measures.|$|E
2500|$|For {{their next}} two albums, Every Good Boy Deserves Favour (1971) – from which Hayward's [...] "The Story in Your Eyes" [...] {{was taken as}} a US {{charting}} single (No. 23) - and Seventh Sojourn (1972) (which reached No. 1 in the US), the band returned to their signature orchestral sound which, while difficult to reproduce in concert, had become their trademark. The title [...] "Every Good Boy Deserves Favour" [...] was borrowed, tongue-in-cheek, from a mnemonic used to remember the musical notes that form {{the lines of the}} treble clef: EGBDF. The opening track [...] "Procession" [...] was the only item composed by all five band members, a fascinating track depicting the [...] "evolution" [...] of music, leading into Hayward's [...] "Story in Your Eyes". Thomas's reflective [...] "Our Guessing Game" [...] and whimsical [...] "Nice To Be Here" [...] offset the deeper drama of Hayward's [...] "You Can Never Go Home", Lodge's [...] "One More Time To Live" [...] and Pinder's [...] "My Song". Edge, the long-standing drummer-poet, started writing lyrics intended to be sung, rather than verses to be spoken – his [...] "After You Came" [...] (1971) featured each of the four lead singers taking a vocal section. Then in 1972, Lodge's songs [...] "Isn't Life Strange?" [...] (No. 13) and [...] "I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)" [...] (No. 36) were lifted from Seventh Sojourn as charting UK singles. Sojourn also saw Pinder using the new Chamberlin instrument in place of the mellotron and Edge using an electronic drum kit. Pinder's stirring lament [...] "Lost in a Lost World" [...] opened this last [...] "Core Seven" [...] outing, while his sympathetic ode to Timothy Leary [...] "When You're a Free Man", Thomas's romantic [...] "For My Lady", and Hayward's serene [...] "New Horizons" [...] <b>all</b> <b>stood</b> out.|$|E
