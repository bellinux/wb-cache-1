6000|$|Close to the Dispensary {{stood the}} Free School, and thither an importunate munshi steered the Englishman, who, by this time, was {{beginning}} to persuade herself that he really was an accredited agent of Government, sent {{to report on the}} progress of Boondi. From a peepul-shaded courtyard came a clamour of young voices. Thirty or forty little ones, from five to eight years old, were sitting in an open verandah learning accounts and Hindustani, said the teacher. No need to ask from what castes they came, for it was written on their faces that they were Mahajans, Oswals, Aggerwals, and in one or two cases, it seemed, Sharawaks of Guzerat. They were learning the business of their lives, and, in time, would take their father's places, and show in how many ways money might be manipulated. Here the profession-type came out with startling distinctness. Through the chubbiness of almost babyhood, or the delicate suppleness of maturer years, in mouth and eyes and hands, it betrayed itself. The Rahtor, who comes of a fighting stock, is a fine animal, and well bred; the Hara, who seems to be more compactly built, is also a fine animal; but for a race that show blood in every line of their frame, from the arch of the instep to the modelling of the head, the financial--trading is too coarse a word--the financial class of Rajputana appears to be the most remarkable. Later in life may become clouded with fat jowl and paunch; but in his youth, his quick-eyed, nimble youth, the young Marwar, to give him his business title, is really a thing of beauty. His manners are courtly. The bare ground and a few slates sufficed for the children who were merely learning the ropes that drag States; but the English class, of boys from ten to twelve, was supplied with real benches and forms and a table with a cloth top. The assistant teacher, for the head was on leave, was a self-taught man of Boondi, young and delicate looking, who preferred reading to speaking English. His youngsters were supplied with [...] "The Third English Reading Book," [...] and were painfully thumbing their way through a doggerel poem about an [...] "old man with hoary hair." [...] One boy, bolder than the rest, slung an English sentence at the visitor, and collapsed. It was his little stock-in-trade, and the rest regarded him enviously. The Durbar supports the school, which is entirely free and open; a just distinction being maintained between the various castes. The old race prejudice <b>against</b> <b>payment</b> for knowledge came out in reply to a question. [...] "You must not sell teaching," [...] said the teacher; and the class murmured applausively, [...] "You must not sell teaching." ...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} using Human Interactive Security Protocols (HISPs) {{to secure}} payments. We start our research by conducting extensive {{investigations into the}} payment industry. After interacting with different payment companies and banks, we present two case studies: online payment and mobile payment. We show how to adapt HISPs for payments by establishing the reverse authentication method. In order to properly and thoroughly evaluate different payment examples, we establish two attack models which cover the most commonly seen attacks <b>against</b> <b>payments.</b> We then present our own payment solutions which aim at solving the most urgent security threats revealed in our case studies. Demonstration implementations are also made to show our advantages. In the end we show how to extend the use of HISPs into other domains.
