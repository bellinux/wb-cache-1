This article investigates the relevance of tax revenue as an <b>automatic</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>stabiliser</b> in the South African economy by an empirical analysis of its role and impact since the 1970 s. The study finds that cyclical changes in tax revenue are relatively small and provide no significant evidence of automatic stabilisation; however, the potential of this tool as an effective <b>automatic</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>stabiliser</b> in South Africa cannot be overlooked as results show a high correlation between the output gap and automatic stabiliser estimates.

40|$|Theoretically, {{unemployment}} insurance (UI) contributions and benefits act in tandem {{to serve as}} counterbalances to {{the direction of the}} economy. Government transfers to households to cover costs related to unemployment are usually the principal source of automatic fluctuation in government expenditure. This article investigates the interaction between such transfers and economic performance with the South African economy as a case study. The main finding is that UI contributions destabilised economic activity most of the time, but that the stabilising effect resulting from UI benefits was sufficient to offset these destabilising effects so that the UI balance acted as an <b>automatic</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>stabiliser</b> over the period 1970 to 2000. The article points out that although UI benefits demonstrate countercyclical properties, the same could not be said with confidence about other components of general government expenditure in South Africa. Furthermore, the stabilising effect of the South African Unemployment Insurance Fund can be expected to be relatively insignificant due to its small share in the total public finances. However, the possible psychological benefits of the UI system and the evidence provided in this paper emphasise the potential of the Unemployment Insurance Fund as an effective <b>automatic</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>stabiliser</b> also in South Africa...|$|E

40|$|When {{setting and}} {{monitoring}} fiscal targets, {{there is a}} need to take explicit account of the cyclical position of the economy and its effect on the budget. Most of the discussion on fiscal policy in South Africa deals only with long-term sustainability issues, largely ignoring the effects of the economic cycle. As a result, serious policy mistakes can occur if purely cyclical improvements in the public finances are treated as if they represent structural improvements, or if structural deterioration is interpreted as a cyclical effect. This study considers the countercyclical role of South African fiscal policy during the period 1970 to 2000. More specifically, it presents theoretical and empirical analysis of the significance of <b>automatic</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>stabilisers</b> in the South African economy and calculates the cyclically adjusted budget balance that can improve fiscal policy-making and analysis. The study compares results for South Africa with six other developing countries (Chile, Mexico, Indonesia, India, Mauritius and Romania) and macroeconomic stabilisation and the potential role of <b>automatic</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>stabilisers</b> in the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) are also investigated. This study highlights the need for continued caution in the use of discretionary policy, greater focus on making <b>automatic</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>stabilisers</b> more effective in South Africa and the integration of better measures of fiscal balance into the discretionary policy process. <b>Automatic</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>stabilisers</b> could also play an important role as a complement to countercyclical monetary policy and the operation of monetary policy could be facilitated by the predictable and automatic responses from <b>automatic</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>stabilisers.</b> Budget rules could play an important role in developing countries and specifically in African countries. If applied flexibly, fiscal rules could be regarded as restoring at least a moderate countercyclical role in these countries through the operation of <b>automatic</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>stabilisers.</b> Although <b>automatic</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>stabilisers</b> are likely to be less important in African countries due to structural reasons, the combination of appropriate rules, taking into account the impact of the business cycle on the public finances and vigilance against the dangers of inappropriate discretionary policy, may make a valuable contribution to Africa’s development.

40|$|The eurozone crisis {{triggered}} {{a whole new}} series of innovations in EU economic governance {{in order to make}} the Union more resilient for the next economic downswing. But one of the more persistent issues are the socio-economic divergences between member states, identified by the Five Presidents’ Report as a major problem in the functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Debates took place in recent years about automatic stabilisers, and more specifically about the possibility of introducing an unemployment insurance within the EMU. While the need for some form of fiscal risk-sharing has become a dominant view in expert circles, there has been much less progress among the main political parties and stakeholders. In this study, Regula Hess and László Andor analyse the political feasibility of the adoption of an <b>automatic</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>stabiliser</b> (AFS) for the eurozone by evaluating actors’ positions towards three distinctive proposals: 1) cyclical shock insurance, 2) reinsurance, 3) a European basic unemployment insurance; they included an empirical case study of France and Germany as the most relevant players within the intergovernmental bargaining constellation. Although the authors realise the current political context makes the adoption of an AFS improbable, Hess and Andor encourage stakeholders to further pursue the discussion, as windows of opportunities can open at any time, and even give some suggestions on what the parameters of the most feasible proposal might be...|$|E

40|$|The article assesses to {{what extent}} various {{components}} of government budgets affected by the macroeconomic situation operate (through influencing domestic demand) to smooth the business cycle 1 in Germany. The {{aim of the research}} is to evaluate government budget sensitivity to economic fluctuations and thereby assess the importance of <b>automatic</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>stabilisers.</b> <b>Fiscal</b> policies and the analysis of <b>fiscal</b> <b>stabilisers</b> {{have been added to the}} agenda due to the fact that the EMU member countries no longer have national monetary policies at their disposal and therefore fiscal policy has to play a more important role in smoothing shocks, especially if they originate on the demand side. However, in order to avoid the typical pitfalls of fiscal finetuning, the main focus has increasingly been put on the work of automatic stabilisers. This view is codified in the Stability and Growth Pact, whose “fiscal philosophy” implies that countries should set a structural target of close to balance or surplus and simply let automatic stabilisers work, where appropriate, over the whole business cycle without breaching the 3 % reference value for the deficit. To determine the size of budgetary cyclical components, i. e. the size of <b>automatic</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>stabilisers</b> and the structural balance, the standard two-step procedure (also followed by the OECD, the IMF and the European Commission) was used. The first stage of this method is to measure the GDP gap, which is needed for both, estimating budget sensitivity and extracting a budget cyclical component. In line with the method of the European Commission, the estimate of the GDP gap is based upon a statistical smoothing technique (the Hodrick-Prescott filter). The Hodrick-Prescott filter (HP-filter) has been selected on the basis of pragmatic criteria such as simplicity and transparency. The second stage is to identify the cyclical sensitivity of all budget components (on the revenue and expenditure side 2) - their sensitivity to the GDP gap. Finally, budget’s cyclical component and structural balance are both calculated on the basis of sensitivity estimates and the GDP gap. It is well known that the <b>automatic</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>stabilisers</b> generally reduced cyclical volatility in the 1990 s, although they were growing weak, while discretionary fiscal policy became more active. However, in Germany the need to undertake fiscal consolidation in order to improve public finances forced governments to take discretionary actions that in effect reduced, or even offset, the effect of <b>automatic</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>stabilisers.</b> Based on data from 1980 until 1998 and using the two-step method, the cyclical sensitivity of the German budget was found to be only 0, 35. This means that when the GDP diverges from its potential value by 1 %, the budget balance will change accordingly by up to 0, 35 % of the GDP...|$|R

This paper shows that differences in opinion mirror a deeper disagreement over how the budget would look like without automatic stabilisers. This issue is addressed by defining two types of counterfactual budgets giving rise to two different interpretations about the nature of automatic stabilisation.

40|$|The {{current debt}} crisis {{has given rise}} to a debate about deeper fiscal {{integration}} in Europe. The view is widespread that moving towards a ‘fiscal union’ would increase the ability of the currency union to maintain economic stability in situations where some member states are affected by economic shocks. At the same time the idea of deepening fiscal integration raises a number of concerns. In particular, residents of high income countries fear that more fiscal integration may lead to massive redistribution in favour of low income countries. As a result, taxes in high income countries could increase and undermine incentives to work and invest. Higher transfers in low income countries could also distort incentives to work. While deeper fiscal integration in Europe is thus a widely debated issue, {{little is known about the}} economic implications of sucha move. This paper contributes to filling this gap by analysing the economic effects of two key elements of fiscal integration, i) the introduction of an EU-wide integrated tax and transfer system which partly or fully replaces the existing national systems and ii) the introduction of a system of fiscal equalisation. These reforms would be far reaching, but they do reflect the widespread view that radical steps towards more fiscal integration are necessary. Even if these reforms seem unlikely to find political support in the short term, it is important to understand why this might be the case and whether much is lost if fiscal integration fails to proceed into this direction. In this paper we study the economic effects of introducing two elements of a fiscal union: Firstly, an EU-wide tax and transfer system and secondly, an EU-wide system of fiscal equalisation. Using the European tax-benefit calculator EUROMOD, we exploit representative household micro data from 11 Eurozone countries to simulate these policy reforms and to study their effects on the distribution of income as well as their impact on <b>automatic</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>stabilisers.</b> We find that replacing one third of the national tax and transfer systems by a European system would lead to significant redistributive effects both within and across countries. Our analysis confirms that labour supply incentives may be undermined in both low and high incume countries. The EU system would improve fiscal stabilisation especially in countries which cannot rely on national <b>automatic</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>stabilisers</b> because they face borrowing constraints while such constraints are unlikely to occur at the EU level. The EU system would absorb between 10 and 15 per cent of a macroeconomic income shock.

Based on the literature in the field, this paper points out the disadvantages of fiscal discretionary policy and argue the need of using <b>Automatic</b> <b>Fiscal</b> Stabilizers in order to provide a faster decision making process, shielded from political interference, and reduced uncertainty for households and business environment. The paper conclude about the need of using fiscal policy for smoothing the economic cycle, but in a way which includes among its features transparency, responsibility and clear operating mechanisms.

Such estimates are useful for analysts who forecast federal revenues and spending; the estimates also allow high- employment or cyclically-adjusted federal tax receipts and expenditures to be estimated. Using frequency domain techniques, we confirm that the relationships found in the time domain are strong at the business cycle frequencies.

Part I examines the economic environment in EMU, analysing the role of markets and the macro-economic framework. It finds that the prospect of EMU has already succeeded in creating a stable macro-economic environment, but that structural reforms aimed at better functioning markets take more time to be implemented and to produce results. Part II investigates the issue of adjustment in EMU in response to macro-economic disturbances, exploring the potential contribution of market mechanisms and macro-economic policies for coping with country-specific shocks. It finds that the new macro-economic framework will soon enable automatic stabilisers to operate better than in the recent past, but that it may take longer for market mechanisms to play their full part.

This paper explores a number of policy issues deriving from Economic and Monetary Union: - Monetary Policy and the Exchange Rate; - Budgetary Policy; - Shocks and Market Adjustment; - Real and Nominal Convergence. II/ 0453 / 97 -ENOn January 1 st 1999, Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) will move to its third and final stage. The exchange rates between the parties will be locked irrevocably and the euro will be introduced. The responsibility for monetary policy in the participating countries will be entrusted to the newly-created European Central Bank. European monetary union must be understood as comprising two separate, but complementary facets: a single currency, and a stable currency. These two facets correspond to the two interrelated objectives of EMU: efficiency and stability. The commitment by national public authorities to meet {{the terms of the}} Treaty on European Union for creating EMU is already bearing important fruit in terms of stability: in the past several years, the convergence towards low inflation has been spectacular and, although more efforts are in order, budget deficits have been substantially reduced. This has resulted in more stable nominal exchange rates and lower long term interest rates, thus paving the way to the current economic recovery. Although EMU represents first and foremost a monetary reform, its implications are much wider. The construction of EMU is geared towards the stability of the new currency, and sound public finances. Together with a well-functioning Single Market, this new policy regime is bound to bring about a new economic environment with fundamental consequences for the behaviour of public and private agents. The gradual elimination of budget deficits, as provided for by the Stability and Growth Pact, implies that government debt, currently still at too high levels, will be set on a consistently downward path. This will have beneficial consequences for interest rates and private investment, help restructuring public expenditure by giving more weight to growth-enhancing factors (such as investment in education and infrastructure), and raise the room for manoeuvre of national budgetary policies in stabilising the cycle. Budgetary discipline will also imply a new, fairer contract between the current and the next generation which will not have to shoulder the burden of today's spending choices. In total, with the change brought about by the EMU regime, the risk of a new stability conflict between the monetary and budgetary policies, which in the past repeatedly contributed to the unsatisfactory growth and employment performance of the Community, could be avoided in the coming years. Private agents, as consumers and producers, will not only benefit from lower transaction costs and simplification entailed by the replacement of multiple national currencies by the euro, but will also see their spectrum of choice broadened. The euro will strengthen the effects of the Single Market due to higher price transparency and greater competition. The relationship between factors of production will also undergo important changes. It will become apparent that if prices and wages are inconsistent with macroeconomic stability and with the Single Market rules, {{there will not be a}} â€œbail outâ€ by public authorities - be it in the form of budgetary handout, looser monetary policy or â€œdefensiveâ€ industrial policies. To the extent that wage and price behaviour anticipate this constraint, EMU will lead to a greater efficiency and higher employment. The changes in behaviour on the part of public authorities and private agents in the new EMU regime are desirable per se, as a means of tackling the structural problems faced by Europe, namely the high and structural unemployment and the budgetary consequences of ageing. Hence EMU acts as a catalyst of changes which would have to take place anyhow to shift the European economies on a path of sustainable growth and high employment. By definition, EMU implies the loss of national monetary autonomy. One of the criticisms often levied against the EMU project is that member countries will not be able to respond to economic disturbances via changes in national monetary policy or in their nominal exchange rate. It is then alleged that negative shocks will result in a surge of unemployment. In reality, the exchange rate, being a â€œnationalâ€ instrument - in that it changes the whole set of domestic prices vis-Ã -vis third countries - is potentially appropriate only in a narrow set of circumstances, namely in the event of shocks affecting the entire national economy and only that economy. If the shock only effects a particular region or sector, a devaluation would lead to over-heating in other parts of the economy. Mutatis mutandis, the same can be said of monetary policy. Shocks that are truly national are already relatively infrequent. And they will become even more so once EMU is in place: The stability-oriented macroeconomic framework will reduce the likelihood of policy-induced shocks (such as disturbances originating in reckless fiscal behaviour), which in the past have been an important source of country-specific shocks. Moreover, the increasing trade interdependence among EMU members will further blur the economic importance of national boundaries, thereby reducing national specificity of economic developments. Admittedly, in those circumstances in which a change in the exchange rate or national monetary policy would have been useful, alternative adjustment channels will have to be provided for in EMU. At the macroeconomic level, a rapid reduction of deficits below the 3 % threshold will create sufficient room for <b>automatic</b> <b>fiscal</b> <b>stabilisers</b> to offset cyclical downturns. Where structural adjustment, rather than mere macro-economic stabilisation is called for, changes in prices and wages will be needed. This requires that product and labour markets operate with greater flexibility. In conclusion, EMU offers important opportunities for better allocation of resources, higher growth and higher employment, but also challenges of completing the necessary budgetary consolidation and stepping up the reforms in product and labour markets. Meeting these challenges will ensure not only the full success of EMU, but will also help in solving Europe's structural problems. macroeconomic policy coordination, emu...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an optimal fiscal policy response {{to address the}} basic tradeoff between the automatic stabilisation properties of budgets and the long run fiscal positions. The framework is an overlapping generations model `a la Weil (1989), extended to account for stochastic endowments and borrowing constrained households. A benign government chooses over the optimal degree of responsiveness of net taxes to individual incomes, an optimal measure of long-run public debt, or both, in order to smooth households’ consumption across states of nature. In {{the presence of a}} deficit constraint for the government, the results unambiguously point to the desire for lower debt levels than those currently prevailing in order to enable a more effective hedging of personal income uncertainty by means of more active <b>fiscal</b> <b>stabilisers.</b> Citizens in economies exhibiting more pronounced cycles will favour less automatic stabilisation combined with a more aggressive policy of debt reduction.

40|$|This paper explores whether {{collective}} {{insurance schemes}} {{of various kinds}} could improve the degree of cyclical income stabilisation and the operation of <b>fiscal</b> <b>stabilisers</b> in the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). We review the potential issues, the underlying trade-offs and the necessary conditions for such schemes to be workable. The paper discusses "good" design features, which raise the potential efficiency and acceptability of these mechanisms. It argues that such schemes would preferably focus on large shocks, moderate the boom times as well as cushion adverse shocks, and include a degree of budgetary prudence to cater for real-time uncertainty in assessing business cycles. It carries out retrospective simulations using both "ex post" and "real-time" data. The results suggest that all the schemes considered would have provided non-negligible income stabilisation over the past 10 - 20 years, although somewhat less so when operating {{on the basis of}} data available in real time. The stabilisation schemes reviewed do not require particularly large or persistent payments into or out of them. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
