The algorithm is very simple to use in radiative transfer codes and is easily adapted to provide analytic Jacobians of radiances. A Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is used to transform very large monochromatic lookup tables of optical depths into a compressed representation that is approximately 73 times smaller. Temperature and pressure interpolations are performed in the compressed representation, resulting in significant savings in computation times. The resulting transmittances are as accurate as those computed with a line-by-line algorithm. 1 Introduction The upcoming generation of nadir viewing satellite instruments for remote sensing of atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles will require accurate forward models for radiative transfer.

Channel dependent empirical tuning coefficients were found such that the biases in the channel brightness temperatures are removed if the transmittances used to calculate these brightness temperatures are modified. Possible shortcomings of this method are that some of the bias errors may be due to instrumental calibration problems and that the part that is computational may not be of the form assumed in the equation used.

Clear-column radiance data in the carbon dioxide channels of the VTPR of NOAA 2 are used in inverting the radiative transfer equations to deduce the T(P) profile. The retrieval technique includes the computation of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>transmittances</b> due to three atmospheric absorber masses (carbon dioxide, water vapor, and ozone) and non-homogeneous temperature-pressure effects along the vertical. The program also corrects these transmittances for zenith path differences between the satellite and the retrieval site when the site is not directly below the sensor. A normalized wave number, close to 700 cm, but decreasing with decreasing values of pressure, was used in solving the Planck function for temperature, level-by-level.

50|$|The entire {{electromagnetic}} spectrum highlighting the infrared part located between the visible {{and the radio}} waves, is depicted in the figure. The IR spectrum can be subdivided into 5 regions, although this definition is somehow arbitrary and it differs from one author to another. The subdivision presented here {{is based on a}} combination of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>transmittance</b> windows, i.e. the wavelengths regions in which infrared radiation is better transmitted through the atmosphere, the detector materials used to build the infrared sensors and the main applications. In this way, the Near Infrared (NIR) band is mostly used in fiber optic telecommunication systems since silica (SiO2) provides a low attenuation losses medium for the infrared, whilst the Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) band allows to work on long-distance telecommunications (remote sensing) using a combinations of detector materials. The Medium Wavelength Infrared (MWIR) and the Long Wavelength Infrared (LWIR) bands find applications in Infrared Thermography for military or civil applications, e.g. target signature identification, surveillance, NonDestructive Evaluation, etc. The Very Long Wavelength Infrared (VLWIR) band is used in spectroscopy and astronomy.|$|E

Simultaneous retrieval of the vertical distribution of both atmospheric temperature and dust optical depth is accomplished through an iterative procedure which is performed on each individual spectrum.

40|$|A {{technique}} for computing the spectral and angular (both the zenith and azimuthal) {{distribution of the}} solar energy reaching the surface of earth and any other plane in the atmosphere has been developed. Here the computer code LOWTRAN is used for getting the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>transmittances</b> in conjunction with two approximate procedures: one based on the Eddington method {{and the other on}} van de Hulst's adding method, for solving the equation of radiative transfer to obtain the diffuse radiation in the cloud-free situation. The aerosol scattering phase functions are approximated by the Hyeney-Greenstein functions. When the equation of radiative transfer is solved using the adding method, the azimuthal and zenith angle dependence of the scattered radiation is evaluated, whereas when the Eddington technique is utilized only the total downward flux of scattered solar radiation is obtained. Results of the diffuse and beam components of solar radiation received on surface of earth compare very well with those computed by other methods such as the more exact calculations using spherical harmonics and when atmospheric conditions corresponding to that prevailing locally in a tropical location (as in India) are used as inputs the computed values agree closely with the measured values...|$|R

It uses the quasi-random band model of absorption for computing <b>atmospheric</b> <b>transmittances</b> due to various bands.

In addition, sensitivity to changes in a number of cloud parameters, namely, fractional cloud cover, cloud height, and high-cloud emissivity, has also been examined. Results obtained with the present model compare well with those from the empirical and semi-empirical correlations.

SEVIRI lacks sufficient bands for chlorophyll remote sensing but its spectral resolution is sufficient for quantification of Total Suspended Matter (TSM) in turbid waters, using a single broad red band, combined with a suitable near infrared band.

40|$|The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) is an Earth-observing sensor, which {{provides}} global retrievals of aerosols, clouds, and land surface parameters. Instrument specifications require an accurate absolute calibration, {{as well as}} accurate camera-to-camera, band-to-band and pixel-to-pixel relative response determinations. In order to achieve these requirements, MISR makes use of an on-board calibrator (OBC), as well as vicarious calibration (VC) experiments. The OBC makes use of two Spectralon diffuse panels {{in order to provide}} a flatfield illumination. Bi-monthly deployments of these panels into the camera fields-of-view will be made. At these times, solar-reflected radiance values are measured by photodiode detector standards. Accurate relative bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) data are required to transfer these photodiode-measured radiances into camera-incident values.
