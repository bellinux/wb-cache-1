25|$|Research on {{alcoholism}} within families has leaned towards exploring {{issues that}} are wrong in the community rather than potential strengths or positives. When researchers conduct research that helps communities, it can be easier for community members {{to identify with the}} positives and work towards a path of resilience. Flawed research design in adult children of alcoholics (ACOA) research showed ACOAs were psychologically damaged. Some flawed research designs include using ACOAs as part of the control group and comparing them to other ACOAs within the same study. This may have caused some limitations in the study that were not listed. When comparing ACOAs to other ACOAs, it is difficult to interpret accurate results that show certain behaviors in the group studied. Research that has been conducted more recently has used control groups with non-ACOAs to see whether the behaviors align with prior research. This research has shown that behaviors were similar between non-ACOAs and ACOAs. An 18 year-long study compared children of alcoholics (COA) to other COAs. In failing to use non-COAs as controls, we miss an opportunity to see if the negative aspects of a person are related to having an alcoholic parent, or <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> simply a fact of life. For example, in Werner’s study, he found that 30% of COAs were committing serious delinquencies. This data would have been more usable if they had viewed the percentage of those committing crimes when compared to non-ACOAs. In a study conducted in a midwestern university, researchers found that {{there was no significant difference}} between ACOA and non-ACOA students. One of the main differences was the student’s views on how they connect their past experiences with their current social-emotional functioning. Students who were ACOAs did not demonstrate issues with their perspective on their interpersonal issues any more than the non-ACA students. However, this study did show that there were other underlying problems in the family structure that may attribute to the perception of not being well adjusted in life.|$|E

50|$|Character {{weaknesses}} and faults, such as tardiness, cowardice, or vice, may leave the narrator unintentionally absent or unreliable for certain key events. Specific events may further be colored or obscured by a narrator's background, since non-omniscient characters must by definition be laypersons and foreigners to some circles, and limitations such as poor eyesight and illiteracy may also leave important blanks. Another consideration {{is how much}} time has elapsed between when the character experienced {{the events of the}} story and when they decided to tell them. If only a few days have passed, the story could be related very differently than if the character was reflecting on events of the distant past. The character's motivation is also relevant. <b>Are</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> trying to clear up events for their own peace of mind? Make a confession about a wrong they did? Or tell a good adventure tale to their beer-guzzling friends? The reason why a story is told will also affect how it is written. Why is this narrator telling the story in this way, why now, and is he to be trusted? Unstable or malevolent narrators can also lie to the reader. Unreliable narrators are not uncommon.|$|E

In 1988, McDonald's contributions to the Special Olympics as a coach and co-chairman of the organization's fundraising efforts, as well as his work with the Alberta Children's Miracle Network Hospitals, were recognized by the NHL as he was named the inaugural recipient of the King Clancy Memorial Trophy. The award is given to the hockey player who best exemplifies leadership on the ice with humanitarian contributions off of it. McDonald was previously honoured by the Flames as the first winner of the Ralph T. Scurfield Humanitarian Award in 1987, which he won again in 1989.|$|E
5000|$|Zohar states: If a {{man looks}} upon the Torah {{as merely a}} book {{presenting}} narratives and everyday matters, alas for him! Such a Torah, one treating with everyday concerns, and indeed a more excellent one, we too, even we, could compile. More than that, {{in the possession of}} the rulers of the world there are books of even greater merit, and these we could emulate if we wished to compile some such torah. But the Torah, in all of its words, holds supernal truths and sublime secrets.Thus the tales related in the Torah are simply her outer garments, and woe to the man who regards that outer garb as the Torah itself, for such a man will be deprived of portion in the next world. Thus David said:" [...] Open Thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of Thy law" [...] (Psalms 119:18), that is to say, the things that are underneath. See now. The most visible part of a man are the clothes that he has on, and they who lack understanding, when they look at the man, are apt not to see more in him than these clothes. In reality, however, it is the body of the man that constitutes the pride of his clothes, and his soul constitutes the pride of his body.Woe to the sinners who look upon the Torah as simply tales pertaining to things of the world, seeing thus only the outer garment. But the righteous whose gaze penetrates to the very Torah, happy <b>are</b> <b>they.</b> <b>Just</b> as wine must be in a jar to keep, so the Torah must also be contained in an outer garment. That garment is made up of the tales and stories; but we, we are bound to penetrate beyond.|$|E

5000|$|December 2016, Klein was {{a return}} guest on The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe {{talking about his}} book His Porn, Her Pain: Confronting America's Porn Panic with Honest Talk about Sex. He {{explained}} that he wrote this book in response to Broadband internet making porn more available - and the accompanying increase in women complaining about their men viewing porn. He also observes {{a new generation of}} stakeholders jumping on the [...] "bandwagon" [...] and being given a seat at the public policy table, even though they know little about sexuality. Host Steven Novella asked Klein if these anti-porn groups are trying to justify their opposition by claiming health issues or <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> confused with the science? Klein said both. People who think masturbation is harmful are falling for pseudoscience. Couples that don't have sex anymore are finding it easier to fight about porn rather than have a meaningful conversation about their lost sexual relationship. [...] "The junk science is there for anyone who wants to use it," [...] he says, noting the common claims that porn leads to various social problems lack evidence to support them. In reality the rates of sexual violence, divorce, teen pregnancy and child molestation are all down since Broadband pornography flooded the country. And the same pattern holds true in countries as diverse from each other as Denmark, Croatia, Japan and Hong Kong. Cara Santa Maria asked if porn leads to unrealistic expectations by men. [...] "Absolutely yes!" [...] Klein answered. [...] "Some people think porn is a documentary, showing real people in real situations... porn is usually unusual bodies, doing unusual things in unusual circumstances." [...] And [...] "Pornography leaves out so much that we value in sex. Kissing, hugging ... whispering... because if you watch people hug, after about 2 seconds it gets real boring." [...] He states that as a consumer product based on fantasy, what you find in it is what people want to see, not necessarily {{what they want to do}} or experience. Both men and woman fantasize about things they would not do even if given the chance. Klein states that he wrote this book to help improve sexual literacy of both adults and minors.|$|E
