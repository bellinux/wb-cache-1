50|$|From 1924 until {{independence}} in 1956, the British had {{a policy of}} running Sudan as two essentially separate territories, the north and south. The assassination of a Governor-General of Khartoum in Cairo was the causative factor; it brought demands of the newly elected Wafd government from colonial forces. A permanent establishment of two battalions in Khartoum was renamed the Sudan Defence Force acting as under the government, replacing the former garrison of Egyptian army soldiers, saw action afterwards during the Wal Wal Incident. The Wafdist parliamentary majority had rejected Sarwat Pasha's <b>accommodation</b> <b>plan</b> with Austen Chamberlain in London; yet Cairo still needed the money. The Sudan Government's revenue had reached a peak in 1928 at £6.6 million, thereafter the Wafdist disruptions, and Italian borders incursions from Somaliland, London decided to reduce expenditure during the Great Depression. Cotton and Gum exports were dwarfed by the necessity to import almost everything from Britain leading to a balance of payments deficit at Khartoum.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Wind {{power in}} China is {{developing}} rapidly but facing the {{problems such as}} wind power integration. Based on the reference to the technical background and experience of the United States, Europe and Japan, some suggestions on wind power portfolio system are made in this paper, which may be helpful for building renewable portfolio standard (RPS) system in China. The suggestions include the function of renewable portfolio standard (RPS) system, the role and manifestation of management measures and formulation of the regulation. Main Problem and Existing Situation of Wind Power Integration in China China has developed a lot in renewable energy industry, especially wind power industry. However, with the great increase of installed wind power capacity blindsides such as difficulty in incorporating wind power into a power grid system and the market lacks sufficient sound economic policies are becoming more obvious. Wind power, PV power status report(2011), released by State Electricity Regulatory commission of People’s Republic of China, indicates that only {{in the first half}} year of 2010, the quantity of non-grid electricity generated from wind power is 100 GWh. The report also indicates that the current development plan of China`s wind power industry mainly places emphasis on resource planning lacks specific delivery and <b>accommodation</b> <b>plan,</b> especially for large capacity wind power generation system which is becoming serious. [1] A. Background of incorporating wind power into power grid in China Wind power industry in China is developing fast. In 2005, the Chinese government began to plan the million-kilowatt wind power base; in 2008, China accelerated the wind power construction and is currently building eight 10 -million-kilowatt wind power bases in seven provinces.

40|$|Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is a {{civil rights}} statute. The purpose of the statute was to {{prohibit}} {{discrimination on the basis}} of disability in any program receiving federal funds. The passage of the Act set the stage for future legislation which addressed the education of students with disabilities. The Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) encased, specified and extended the regulatory requirements of Section 504. It is this very nature of co-existence that has created a climate of confusion for those who are charged with the responsibility of implementation, particularly in the area of designing 'reasonable accommodations' for disabled students. The language of Section 504 is relatively vague, opening the door for wide interpretation. Common terminology in IDEA and Section 504 are defined differently. Again, creating confusion and, in some cases, argument between parents and the school district. 'Reasonable accommodations' is a relevant term under Section 504 however; it is not a relevant term under the IDEA. The Office for Civil Rights has infrequently attended to substantive issues but rather focused on procedural issues, leaving 'reasonable accommodations' and other such questions to the courts. Although marked by inconsistency and some confusion, the judicial trend seems to be toward interpreting Section 504 as requiring recipients to make 'reasonable accommodations' rather than unqualified affirmative action. This dissertation will provide an examination of select court cases that address the issue of 'reasonable accommodations' under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act 1973. It is assumed that the most recent court rulings would incorporate the findings of prior court rulings as a basis for the decision. This analysis of the interpretations of the rulings will be the foundation for the development of a reference tool for district administration to consider when developing an <b>accommodation</b> <b>plan...</b>|$|E

40|$|The boom-bust cycles within {{resources}} {{industries in}} Australia {{make it difficult}} to plan for the sustainable development of workforce locations in regional communities. A variety of logistical, financial and lifestyle factors are contributing to an increased use of non-resident workforce for both short and long term construction, operational and maintenance, raising a number of issues about the sustainability of mining village accommodation and development that this encourages. Forward planning {{to meet the needs of}} resource industries and their workforce requires knowledge of accommodation alternatives and preferences, especially when seeking to attract skilled professionals to regional areas.

30|$|In the Netherlands, {{this meant}} making {{employers}} bear {{more of the}} direct costs {{of the program and}} making employees comply with rehabilitation and retraining in order to maintain benefits. In Sweden this meant standardizing the disability screening process and holding disability gatekeepers accountable for engaging applicants in work rehabilitation plans. Sweden also mandated that employers document how they had attempted to accommodate impaired workers. Finally, reforms focused on making workers comply with the work-first approach by reducing or eliminating benefits to those workers who did not comply with the rehabilitation and <b>accommodation</b> <b>plans.</b> Great Britain has similarly made employers responsible for paying sickness benefits for the first 28 weeks of a claim, has standardized the disability screening process, and has made it increasingly difficult to remain passively on long-term disability benefits without engaging in work-related activity. Reforms have also sought to address financial incentives related to imbalances in replacement rates between disability benefits and other welfare benefits. In Australia, most recently (since 2011) it has meant implementation of a new disability benefit assessment procedure, under which eligibility for benefits typically requires evidence that claimants were unable to obtain employment through vocational rehabilitation or other employment services over a period of up to two years, during which time claimants receive NSA and associated support services.|$|R

40|$|Early {{strategic}} mine planning includes decisions {{over the}} {{organisation of work}} and workforce accommodation. These decisions involve significant commitments that affect not only employee quality of life but also the impacts and relationships with existing local communities. Strategies for workforce accommodation are characteristically community-based (either as purpose-built company towns or integrated within existing local communities) or commuter (fly-in, fly-out) mine camps. The quality of accommodation underpins the fulfilment, morale and motivation of employees. This is not only relevant to productivity and safety, but also to recruitment and retention, particularly with the current onset of a significant human resources crisis. In the event that communities exist in proximity to a proposed mine then the accommodation strategy selected can influence the value-adding potential for the sustainable development of such communities. This early planning is particularly challenging where mine locations are isolated and/or face significant economic, social and political adversity. This paper draws upon a case study review of five large mining projects implemented in three South American countries, selected to cover a range of scenarios and accommodation strategies.
