5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E
25|$|It sort of is {{a little}} puzzle <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> it goes by - but they're all great things. 'I won't stop doing {{beautiful}} things and I won't do bad things.' It's very noble. I'm {{very proud of that}} song because it's very much like out of the world of Excalibur. To me, it's like Sir Lancelot or something - very noble and chivalrous. That's my favorite song on the record - it's very ambitious.|$|E
25|$|He wasn't a gregarious bloke, really. He was {{actually}} quite retiring, {{but he was}} always up for a bit of fun. He never seemed to take his cricket all that seriously, in that country way. Numbers didn't mean much to him. In a lot of respects he had that 'Hookesy' outlook. Why would you get eight not out in 10 overs? He couldn't understand, what's the use of that? His record suggests unfulfilled talent <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that's what it was to a certain extent.|$|E
6000|$|We {{sat down}} in the window-seat; I assured her I would not scold, {{whatever}} her secret might be, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> it, of course; so she commenced-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no,' {{said the}} old lady, with some vexation, closing her eyes. 'I said so. He asked me to <b>guess.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> Mary Lawford; now do you see?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] she replied, {{with a faint}} note of truculence in her tone. [...] "You know I'm not {{short of}} money, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> it was where I should find you." ...|$|R
25|$|It's {{tougher to}} {{be a young}} writer today than when I was a young writer. I don't think my first novel would have been {{published}} today as I submitted it. I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually we all did some work on the book and it was published. I don't think publishers {{have that kind of}} tolerance these days, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> possibly as a result, more writers go to writing class now than then. I think first, fiction, and second, novels, are much more refined in terms of language, but they may tend to be too well behaved, almost in response to the narrower market.|$|E
500|$|It was cool. It was {{a really}} nice session, she was really lovely. [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> as the song ('Hold Tight') came out, her fans seem to respond it really well, so yeah, awesome! And she's a legend, and it's an awesome {{opportunity}} to work with someone like Madonna who's literally shaped the careers of so many artists that I've wanted to work with and that I look up to. She's the queen!.|$|E
500|$|While {{working with}} Williams College's {{baseball}} team in 1929, McGinnity became ill. He had {{surgery to remove}} tumors from his bladder, and {{was said to be}} in critical condition. After the surgery, he was quoted as saying [...] "it's the ninth inning, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> they're going to get me out." [...] He died November 14, 1929 in Brooklyn, New York, at the home of his daughter. He was interred in McAlester.|$|E
60|$|I slipped {{behind a}} large boulder {{near the mouth}} of the ravine <b>and</b> waited. <b>I</b> could hear the {{crashing}} of underbrush in the forest, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> that whoever came came quickly--pursued and pursuers, doubtless.|$|R
6000|$|... "Friend," [...] {{answered}} Marcus, [...] "If {{you desire}} to know, I {{was about to}} fall upon my sword. One more minute <b>and</b> <b>I</b> should have been dead. They brought it me with the cloak and other things. It was thoughtful of them, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> their meaning." ...|$|R
60|$|I saw Madonna Paola's eyes gleam with {{a sudden}} light of admiration, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> that {{in the matter of}} Giovanni's valour her {{opinions}} were undergoing the same change as the verses had caused them to undergo in the matter of his intellect.|$|R
500|$|Despite its poor {{performance}} at the American box office, Labyrinth was a success on home video and later on DVD. David Bowie told an interviewer in 1992, [...] "every Christmas a new flock of children comes {{up to me and}} says, 'Oh! you're the one who's in Labyrinth!" [...] In 1997, Jennifer Connelly said [...] "I still get recognized for Labyrinth by little girls in the weirdest places. I can't believe they still recognize me from that movie. It's on TV all the time <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> I pretty much look the same." ...|$|E
500|$|She {{began to}} appear in small-budget films which did well with critics, such as 1997's drama Inventing the Abbotts, set in the late 1950s, in which she played the part of Eleanor, one of three daughters of the town millionaire, Lloyd Abbott. About her performance, {{director}} Ron Howard said, [...] "She not only was beautiful and seductive but gave some difficult psychological moments in the film a lot of depth and complexity. She had an extraordinary combination of talent and beauty, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> I stored that information {{in the back of my}} brain".|$|E
500|$|Derulo {{explained}} {{that he did not}} believe in the possibility of [...] "It Girl" [...] to be the next single from Future History. However, his peers believed that it was very distinct from the lead single, [...] "Don't Wanna Go Home" [...] and that response motivated him to pick it as the second single. He believed that showing the difference in the new album was important in picking the single. He did not want to put another dance song so that his fans do not assume that the entire album consisted of uptempo songs. He concluded that [...] "growing up has definitely taken place. My music has always been a representation of who I am <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> I speak differently, my demeanour is different." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You wouldn't know me, would you?" [...] she inquired. [...] "Say, I {{scarcely}} know myself. I used to {{wear this}} dress at Pratt's, with white collars <b>and</b> cuffs and--well, <b>I</b> just put it on again. I had it {{in the bottom of}} my trunk, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> you'd like it." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{followed}} {{down the}} bank of the Thames after we came upon it. I was anxious to look with my own eyes upon the famous bridge, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed,</b> too, that the river would lead me into the part of London where stood Westminster Abbey and the Tower.|$|R
6000|$|... “Dry up, Papa,” said Case. “’Tain’t you that’s {{to marry}} her. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> you’re not her godfather <b>and</b> godmother. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> Mr. Wiltshire’s going to please himself.” ...|$|R
500|$|On 18 October, The Sun {{reported}} that McGuire {{had left the}} band. At a reception when Ayers Rock returned to Australia, he said: [...] "The pressure of the tour was just too much. We {{were on the road}} all the time <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> I wasn't as strong {{as the rest of the}} band. When we got into the studio I had the shakes. I mean I was playing the right notes, but not in the right places." [...] To finish the album McGuire's friend Les Young played some of the bass guitar parts, and American Jeff Castleman played bass on [...] "Catchanemu". Young also briefly played live with Ayers Rock in Australia, including an October 1975 show at the State Theatre in Sydney. McGuire returned to the group at the Dallas Brooks Hall on 21 October 1975, to warm applause.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the less}} {{favorable}} contemporary critiques, a Melody Maker reviewer dismissed the album as [...] "Not typical Byrds music, which is rather a pity." [...] Writing in Crawdaddy! {{just before he}} withdrew from city life and temporarily retired from music journalism, Paul Williams lamented: [...] "I'm beginning to think I'll have to make this jailbreak unaided … The Byrds have gone country and Big Pink is out, and it's beautiful stuff, man, beautiful … But country is just more relaxation, wonderful stifling inertia … <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> this isn't the summer to look to be rescued by music." [...] Robert Shelton of The New York Times similarly commented that [...] "The latest Byrds album adheres {{to most of the}} 'rules of the game' about country sound, and yet, sad to say, to this old fan of the Byrds, the album is a distinguished bore." ...|$|E
500|$|During Howard's solo concerts from 1983to 1999, [...] "Shivers" [...] was {{the song}} most {{requested}} by audience members. However, {{by the time}} of his final tour in 2009—the year he died—he had stopped receiving requests for it. In an October 2009 interview, Howard commented on his relationship with the song, and its position in his setlists, stating: [...] "I have just tried, perhaps finally successfully, to divorce myself from the song. It's impossible for me to recreate what I was trying to do when I wrote that song so whilst I can see that people have an attachment to it, I don't. I feel like, when I did use to do it in shows, I was doing a cover of some song that had been around forever. That's how it felt. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that is a strange way to feel about a song you wrote, so yeah, I am happy to not have to do it these days".|$|E
60|$|You see, {{it was an}} {{endurance}} test, and no man {{likes to}} give another best. Faugh! it was steam beer. I had learned more expensive brews. Not for years had I drunk steam beer; but when I had, I had drunk with men, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>I</b> could show these youngsters some ability in beer-guzzling. And the drinking began, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had to drink {{with the best of}} them. Some of them might lag, but the guest of honour was not permitted to lag.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dry up, Papa," [...] said Case. [...] "'Tain't you that's {{to marry}} her. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> you're not her godfather <b>and</b> godmother. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> Mr. Wiltshire's going to please himself." ...|$|R
50|$|On 13 April 2017, 10 {{days after}} the meeting. Isa Sadriu, Kosovo U15 coach said that Zeka {{expected}} be invited {{to one of the}} upcoming clusters of Kosovo U21 <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> that is very big talent, otherwise an Albanian would had it impossible to play for Partizan or Serbia national teams.|$|R
500|$|The {{cast and}} {{the crew of the}} show enjoyed the episode, for the most part. Co-producer Paul Rabwin said that the episode had some of the funniest {{material}} in The X-Files {{as well as some of}} the most horrific, such as the scene where a cockroach crawled into someone's arm. Gillian Anderson rated the episode one of her favorite episodes of the third season. On a more negative note, writer Darin Morgan ended up being unhappy with the final product, saying [...] "The other day, my girlfriend was saying, 'I never understood that episode,' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> I don't either. It was an episode that had a lot of what I thought were really good ideas and never quite got it to work. I was really disappointed with that episode. Some people love it." [...] The plot for [...] "War of the Coprophages" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1997 by Les Martin, under the title Die, Bug, Die!.|$|E
500|$|The {{musical score}} for Hulk was {{composed}} by Danny Elfman, who scored Spider-Man the previous year. Frequent Ang Lee collaborator, Mychael Danna, {{was the original}} composer for the film. However, Danna's score was rejected by studio executives for its non-traditional approach, which featured Japanese taiko, African drumming, and Arabic singing. Elfman was then approached by Universal's president of film music, Kathy Nelson. With 37 days to compose over two hours of music, Elfman agreed out of respect to Lee. While instructing to retain much {{of the character of}} Danna's score, Lee pushed Elfman to write material that did not sound like his previous superhero scores. [...] "They did leave some of my music in the movie," [...] said Danna, [...] "so the Arabic singing and some of the drumming is mine. What happened is that they panicked, they brought in Danny and he heard what I've been doing <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> he liked it." ...|$|E
500|$|On August 28, 1974, Louis Peraino of Bryanston {{agreed to}} {{distribute}} the film worldwide, from which Bozman and Skaaren would receive $225,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted) and 35% of the profits. Years later Bozman stated, [...] "We {{made a deal with}} the devil, , <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that, in a way, we got what we deserved." [...] They signed the contract with Bryanston and, after the investors recouped their money (with interest),—and after Skaaren, the lawyers, and the accountants were paid—only $8,100 (about $ inflation-adjustedn) was left to be divided among the 20 cast and crew members. Eventually the producers sued Bryanston for failing to pay them their full percentage of the box office profits. A court judgment instructed Bryanston to pay the filmmakers $500,000 (about $ inflation-adjusted), but by then the company had declared bankruptcy. In 1983 New Line Cinema acquired the distribution rights from Bryanston and gave the producers a larger share of the profits.|$|E
60|$|Harold bit {{the hair}} that hung over his lip, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed,</b> what <b>I</b> {{afterwards}} {{found to be}} the truth, that his stepfather was no small trial to him; being, in fact, an unprosperous tutor and hanger-on on some nobleman's family, finally sent out by his patrons in despair, to keep school in Sydney.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew your}} funny sneeze, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> {{that you came}} to see how I did, though it is very late. Don't be worried, I'm better now, {{and it is my}} fault I was ill, not yours; for I needn't have been so silly as to wait in the cold just because I said I would." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you don't}} I'll {{try not to}} cry over you," [...] she retorted; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> the madcap had made some wager with {{him that he could}} not leap the fence. Sally {{afterwards}} declared penitently that she never fancied he would attempt it; but I could see by the lad's face he meant to take the risk.|$|R
500|$|The {{edition of}} October 1, 1990 of People {{included}} {{an interview with}} then-First Lady of the United States Barbara Bush. The article included the following passage: [...] "She loves America's Funniest Home Videos but remains baffled after sampling The Simpsons. [...] "It was the dumbest thing I had ever seen," [...] she says, [...] "but it's a family thing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> it's clean." [...] The writers decided to respond by privately sending a polite letter on September 28 to Bush where they posed as Marge Simpson. On October 9, Bush sent a reply: [...] "Dear Marge, How kind of you to write. I'm glad you spoke your mind ... I foolishly didn't know you had one. I am looking {{at a picture of}} you... depicted on a plastic cup... with your blue hair filled with pink birds peeking out all over. Evidently, you and your charming family— Lisa, Homer, Bart and Maggie— are camping out. It's a nice family scene. Clearly you are setting a good example {{for the rest of the}} country. Please forgive a loose tongue." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2012, Marco Beltrami, who {{previously}} scored James Mangold's film [...] (2007), {{announced that he}} had signed on to score The Wolverine. Following Mangold's noir and Spaghetti Western inspirations for the film, Beltrami explained, [...] "I think I do every movie as a western whether it is or not, so there’s definitely some of the spaghetti western influence on my music throughout the score, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> throughout a lot of my work. I wouldn’t say there was a particular movie that influenced me more than something else. There was nothing that I was trying to mimic or anything." [...] On associating sounds with the film's primary location, Beltrami said, [...] "I think the last thing that Jim [...] and I wanted to do was Japanese music associated with Japanese places. There's a reference; I do use Japanese instruments, [...] not really in a traditional way." [...] The score was performed by an 85-piece ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Newman Scoring Stage at 20th Century Fox.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of GoldenEye in {{reviving}} the Bond series, there was pressure to recreate that success in the film's follow-up production. This pressure came from MGM along with its new owner, billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, both of whom wished for the film's release to coincide with their public stock offering. Co-producer Michael G. Wilson also expressed concern regarding the public's expectations subsequent to {{the success of}} GoldenEye, commenting: [...] "You realize that there's a huge audience <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> you don't want to come out with a film that's going to somehow disappoint them." [...] This was the first Bond film to be made after the death of Albert R. Broccoli, who had previously been involved with the series' production since its beginning. The rush to complete the film drove the budget to $110 million. The producers were unable to persuade Martin Campbell, the director of GoldenEye, to return; his agent said that [...] "Martin just didn't want to do two Bond films in a row." [...] Instead, Roger Spottiswoode was chosen in September 1996. Spottiswoode said he had previously offered to direct a Bond film while Timothy Dalton was still in the leading role.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind," [...] Joe Garland {{answered}} softly. [...] "You are too kind. <b>And</b> anyway, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> don't want your money. I go tomorrow on the Alameda." ...|$|R
