5|$|A Bulldog Drummond {{radio series}} {{ran on the}} Mutual Broadcasting System from 13 April 1941 to 12 January 1949. An <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> at a revival between 3 January and 28 March 1954. Drummond was {{initially}} portrayed by George Coulouris, before being taken over by Santos Ortega and Ned Wever after 1942; Cedric Hardwicke took over in 1954.|$|E
25|$|<b>Attempts</b> have <b>been</b> <b>made</b> {{to combine}} {{aspects of the}} Kharkiv and Kyiv banduras into a unified instrument. The first <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> by the Honcharenko {{brothers}} in Germany in 1948. <b>Attempts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> in the 1960s by Ivan Skliar, in the 1980s by V.

5|$|A £40 million {{contract}} to build 27 Urbos 3 trams, sufficient for phase 1a and (unbuilt) 1b lines, {{was awarded to}} CAF. When the line was cut back to York Place, only 17 trams would be needed. An unsuccessful <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> in 2011 to lease ten trams to Transport for London for use on Tramlink.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> {{to collect}} a {{specimen}} by Lord Crawford on his yacht Valhalla in 1905. A final <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> during the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition, which passed by in April 1922 on its way back to Britain. This visit also failed, but members of the expedition left collecting material with a Rev. H. M. C. Rogers, then chaplain on Tristan da Cunha. The following year two study skins arrived in the Natural History Museum, London, followed soon after by another skin and a specimen in spirits. Physician Percy Lowe was then {{able to use the}} skins to describe the species. He did so, briefly, {{at a meeting of the}} British Ornithologists' Club, in 1923.|$|E

5|$|Road Runner, Rocky and Bullwinkle, and The Muppets {{have all}} been cited as inspirations for the film.

5|$|The first poorhouse at Framlingham, the Red House, {{was finally}} {{built in the}} Inner Court and used as a home for poor families; it proved {{unsatisfactory}} and, following the mismanagement of the poorhouse funds, the Red House was closed and used as a public house instead. The maintenance of the meres ceased around this time {{and much of the}} area returned to meadow. In 1699 another <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> to open a poorhouse on the site, resulting in the destruction of the Great Chamber around 1700. This poorhouse failed too, and in 1729 a third <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> – the Great Hall was pulled down and the current poorhouse built on its site instead. Opposition to the Poor Law grew, and in 1834 the law was changed to reform the system; the poorhouse on the castle site was closed by 1839, the inhabitants being moved to the workhouse at Wickham Market.|$|E
5|$|To {{assist in}} {{speeding}} up the ship's construction, the internal hull structure was simplified {{as much as possible}} and an <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> to standardize on a limited number of standard plates, which varied only in their thickness.|$|E
5|$|An <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> {{to provide}} the {{completed}} Arrows to the National Research Council of Canada as high-speed test aircraft. The NRC refused, noting that without sufficient spare parts and maintenance, as well as qualified pilots, the NRC could make no use of them. A similar project initiated by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (Boscombe Down) had resulted in Avro vice-president (engineering) Jim Floyd's preparing a transatlantic ferry operation. This proposal, like others from the United States, was never realized.|$|E

5|$|At this time, the {{existing}} infantry battalions of the Citizens Force were redesignated {{to perpetuate the}} numerical designations of the AIF, and although an <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> to allocate these designations based on regional considerations, ultimately this was not always possible and ultimately when the 3rd Division was re-established, only two of its component battalions—the 37th and 39th Battalions—had previously been assigned to the division.|$|E
5|$|From 1513, Petar Kružić {{was one of}} the {{commanding}} officers of Klis Fortress. The Ottomans attempted to conquer the Klis Fortress on several occasions. The first major attempt was by Skender-beg Ornosović in 1515. The Ottomans captured Klis, a village just below the fortress bearing the same name, but the garrison in the fortress above held. Kružić was promoted to captain of the Klis Fortress by the ban Petar Berislavić in 1520. The second major attempt was in 1520, and a year later another <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> by Makut-paša, with additional 2,000 infantry, 50 horsemen and siege equipment. Another unsuccessful <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> in 1522, by Hasan-paša from Mostar and Mehmed-beg Mihalbegović. Later that year, Mihalbegović made another attempt at a siege with 3,000 men, but failed again. During 1523, Klis Fortress was again under attack by the Sultan's army. Attempts were also made by Gazi Husrev-beg in 1526 and 1528, and later in 1531 and 1532.|$|E
5|$|Little or no <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> {{to recruit}} African-American or other women {{minorities}} until October 1944, when President Roosevelt approved of accepting African-American {{women into the}} women's reserve, under pressure {{to do so by}} African-American organizations. Harriet Ida Pickens and Frances Wills were the first African-American women to become WAVE officers. By September 1945, there were 72 African-American women in the WAVES and integrated.|$|E

5|$|Many in Rome {{still thought}} {{reconciliation}} with England was possible, and Paul III elevated two English cardinals, John Fisher (at the time imprisoned {{and sentenced to}} death by Henry VIII) and Girolamo Ghinucci. The execution of Fisher prompted Paul III to excommunicate and purportedly depose Henry VIII. While Campeggio lived, no <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> in Rome to fill any of the thirteen episcopal vacancies in England.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Israeli Southern Command {{attempted}} {{to pinpoint the}} main Egyptian effort to launch a counterattack with Dan Shomron's reserve armored brigade, when, in fact, there was no main effort. As a result, Southern Command wasted several critical hours without taking decisive action. Tactical errors also showcased themselves when Reshef moved his tank brigade forward; Israeli commanders neglected to conduct reconnaissance beforehand, causing their units to fall into Egyptian ambushes. In the confusion ensuing the surprise assault, no <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> at evacuating the Bar Lev garrison.|$|E
5|$|On 30 November 1974, an {{assassination}} <b>attempt</b> <b>was</b> <b>made</b> on Kiep, during {{which a man}} fired three shots {{at the door of}} his sauna, though he remained uninjured. The assassin was never found and leads hinting towards involvement of the Red Army Faction proved inconclusive. As the German magazine Der Spiegel wrote a year later, some party colleagues allegedly considered it possible that Kiep had staged the attack himself.|$|E
50|$|The {{elections}} were marred by riots in Peshtera, where <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> {{to steal the}} ballot boxes and assault the presiding officer. Violence also occurred in Belogradchik, where <b>attempts</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> to prevent the polling station closing until supporters of one candidate had arrived. Voter turnout was low, largely due to indifference in rural areas where national politics was not considered of importance.|$|R
