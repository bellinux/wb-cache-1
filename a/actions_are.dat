5|$|Utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill criticised Kant for {{not realizing}} that moral laws are {{justified}} by a moral intuition based on utilitarian principles (that the greatest good for the greatest number ought to be sought). Mill argued that Kant's ethics could not explain why certain <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> wrong without appealing to utilitarianism. As basis for morality, Mill believed that his principle of utility has a stronger intuitive grounding than Kant's reliance on reason, and can better explain why certain <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> right or wrong.|$|E
5|$|Brooke's {{character}} is strongly driven by {{his desire to}} break from conventions. Brooke's unconventional <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> common throughout the novel, the most prominent being nude bathing and odd remarks and humour. These actions create an externally carefree individual that is in strong contrast to the down-to-earth Nell.|$|E
5|$|Composers {{tried to}} match beats-per-minute to the {{gameplay}} and traversal system. The game features a dynamic music system, in which in-game <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> {{reflected by the}} music. When there is more on-screen action, or when players perform kills, the music becomes more frantic and exciting to help players further immerse themselves in the game.|$|E
50|$|Imperative: The {{imperative}} mode {{is marked}} by several different morphemes, {{depending on how the}} <b>action</b> <b>is</b> to be carried out. /pi/ is used when the <b>action</b> <b>is</b> to be carried out {{in the presence of the}} speaker, as in cenopi Look!. /pada/ is used when the <b>action</b> <b>is</b> to be completed in the absence of the speaker.|$|R
50|$|Primary <b>action</b> <b>is</b> extorsion (external rotation); {{secondary}} <b>action</b> <b>is</b> elevation; tertiary <b>action</b> <b>is</b> abduction (i.e. it extorts the eye {{and moves}} it upward and outwards). The field of maximal inferior oblique elevation is in the adducted position.|$|R
50|$|The {{dependent}} <b>action</b> <b>is</b> expressed with an adverbial participle. The main <b>action</b> <b>is</b> {{conveyed by}} the verb. If also the main <b>action</b> <b>is</b> conditional (a typical usage), {{than it can}} be expressed with a verb of conditional mood. The persons need not coincide.|$|R
5|$|Several {{courses of}} <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> being taken globally, notably the Convention on Biological Diversity, {{otherwise}} known as the Rio Accord, which includes 189 signatory countries that are focused on identifying endangered species and habitats. Another notable conservation organization is the IUCN, which has a membership of over 1,200 governmental and non-governmental organizations.|$|E
5|$|The {{most modern}} <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> {{primarily}} electronic, which connect the console and windchests via narrow data cables {{instead of the}} larger multiconductor cables of electric actions. Boxes containing small embedded computers in the console and near the windchests translate console commands into fast serial data for the cable, and back into electrical commands at the windchest.|$|E
5|$|Finite {{symmetry}} {{groups such}} as the Mathieu groups are used in coding theory, which is in turn applied in error correction of transmitted data, and in CD players. Another application is differential Galois theory, which characterizes functions having antiderivatives of a prescribed form, giving group-theoretic criteria for when solutions of certain differential equations are well-behaved. Geometric properties that remain stable under group <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> investigated in (geometric) invariant theory.|$|E
2500|$|The {{bioavailability}} is 100% in intravenous (IV) injection, and {{the very}} rapid onset of <b>action</b> <b>is</b> seen within seconds. The T1/2 is 14.1 to 26.2 hours. The apparent volume of distribution is between 9.5 and 21.7 L/kg. [...] The duration of <b>action</b> <b>is</b> four to six hours. If haloperidol is given as a slow IV infusion, the onset of <b>action</b> <b>is</b> slowed, and the duration of <b>action</b> <b>is</b> prolonged.|$|R
25|$|The {{essential}} {{difference is}} in what determines {{whether or not}} an <b>action</b> <b>is</b> the right <b>action.</b> Act utilitarianism maintains that an <b>action</b> <b>is</b> right if it maximizes utility; rule utilitarianism maintains that an <b>action</b> <b>is</b> right if it conforms to a rule that maximizes utility.|$|R
50|$|Following {{intramuscular}} injection, the antiemetic <b>action</b> <b>is</b> evident within 5 to 10 {{minutes and}} lasts for 3 to 4 hours. Rapid <b>action</b> <b>is</b> also noted after buccal treatment. With oral dosing, {{the start of}} <b>action</b> <b>is</b> delayed but the duration somewhat longer (approximately 6 hours).|$|R
5|$|Golden Sun is a {{contemporary}} {{presentation of the}} traditional role-playing video game formula, in which the player controls a cast of four characters as they journey through a fantasy-themed world, interact with other characters, battle monsters, acquire increasingly powerful abilities and equipment, and take part in an ongoing narrative. Although many of the player's <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> compulsory, Golden Sun often allows the player to visit previous locations and complete certain objectives out of order.|$|E
5|$|Habermas {{argues that}} his ethical theory is an {{improvement}} on Kant's ethics. He rejects the dualistic framework of Kant's ethics. Kant distinguished between the phenomena world, {{which can be}} sensed and experienced by humans, and the noumena, or spiritual world, which is inaccessible to humans. This dichotomy was necessary for Kant because it could explain the autonomy of a human agent: although a human is bound in the phenomenal world, their <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> free in the intelligible world. For Habermas, morality arises from discourse, which is made necessary by their rationality and needs, rather than their freedom.|$|E
5|$|Monsters {{will talk}} to the player during the battle, and the game will tell the players what the monster's {{feelings}} and <b>actions</b> <b>are.</b> Enemy attacks change based on how players interact with them: should players choose non-violent options, enemy attacks are easy, whereas they become difficult if players choose violent options. The game relies {{on a number of}} metafictional elements in both its gameplay and story. When players participate in a boss battle on a second playthrough, the dialogue will be altered depending on actions in previous playthroughs.|$|E
50|$|The {{essential}} {{difference is}} in what determines {{whether or not}} an <b>action</b> <b>is</b> the right <b>action.</b> Act utilitarianism maintains that an <b>action</b> <b>is</b> right if it maximizes utility; rule utilitarianism maintains that an <b>action</b> <b>is</b> right if it conforms to a rule that maximizes utility.|$|R

5|$|Red Cloud's actions gave E Company {{time and}} warning to blunt the Chinese offensive, {{eventually}} repelling the attack. His <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> also credited with allowing his company to evacuate several others {{wounded in the}} attack. When members of the 2nd Battalion returned to the hill and arrived at Red Cloud's position to recover his body the next morning, they found it {{was surrounded by a}} large number of dead Chinese troops.|$|E
5|$|The NSS {{is headed}} by Baek San (Kim Yeong-cheol), its {{standing}} deputy director only in title and {{the man responsible for}} the recruiting of Hyun-jun and Sa-woo. The named director of the NSS comes and goes with each change of power in the presidency, but it is the deputy director that oversees the organization. Baek San's motivations for many of his <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> mysterious, occasionally outright inconsistent with that of the general national interests. Due to the very existence of the organization being kept secret, he enjoys a state of personal protection that few others do.|$|E
5|$|The {{combat system}} is turn-based instead of real-time. Gameplay is usually step-based, where player <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> {{performed}} serially {{and take a}} variable measure of in-game time to complete. Game processes (e.g., monster movement and interaction, progressive effects such as poisoning or starvation) advance based on {{the passage of time}} dictated by these actions. This requires the player to learn and apply tactics as they progress in the dungeon.|$|E

30|$|When the <b>action</b> <b>is</b> {{a single}} path action and no handoff happens, the penalty is 0. The penalty will change to be K {{when the current}} <b>action</b> <b>is</b> a {{multi-path}} policy. As shown in Figure 3, there are information exchanges between the SA and AP when handoff is triggered and finished. We assume the reward for these <b>actions</b> to <b>be</b> zero {{since most of the}} bandwidth is occupied by the communication overhead. The cost for these <b>actions</b> <b>is</b> f(s(t)).|$|R
5|$|These <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> {{represented}} {{in a form}} of visual shorthand by the three basic elements of Feynman diagrams: a wavy line for the photon, a straight line for the electron and a junction of two straight lines and a wavy one for a vertex representing emission or absorption of a photon by an electron. These can all {{be seen in the}} adjacent diagram.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Raziel {{discovers the}} Oracle's Cave, where Moebius the Time Streamer once hid the Chronoplast, a magical time machine. Raziel {{traverses}} the caves and finds Kain in the Chronoplast's control room. Raziel is angered {{over what he}} has learned, and Kain says his <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> justified due to his being subject to destiny, before proceeding to inform Raziel that the Sarafan were far from the noble crusaders that Raziel believes them to be when the latter demands to know why he created him, which Raziel refuses to listen to. Raziel attacks Kain while the latter continues to adjust the Chronoplast's controls. Although Raziel eventually gains an advantage, the Chronoplast activates, and Kain escapes through a time portal, beckoning Raziel to follow. Raziel complies, ignoring warnings from The Elder God. As the game ends, Raziel emerges from the timeslip and is greeted by Moebius, leading into the events of Soul Reaver 2.|$|E
5|$|As a point-and-click {{adventure}} game, {{the player}} controls Simon using the mouse. The iOS and Android versions feature touch-screen controls. Gameplay involves moving Simon around and interacting with objects and other characters. The player can make Simon perform actions such as giving an item to another character, talk to another character, {{and pick up}} (add to inventory), examine, use, move, consume, wear, or open or close an item. Some <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> binary: they involve two objects and the player sometimes, after telling Simon to use an item, needs to specify what to use it with. A map that enables Simon to instantly transport to a major landmark (if it has been discovered) is provided. The postcard is used to load, save, or quit the game.|$|E
50|$|The primary (main) {{action of}} the {{superior}} oblique muscle is intorsion (internal rotation), the secondary <b>action</b> <b>is</b> depression (primarily in the adducted position) and the tertiary <b>action</b> <b>is</b> abduction (lateral rotation).|$|R

5|$|At a church, {{the killer}} is searching through files {{when he is}} interrupted, and flees, leaving bloodied {{fingerprints}} at the scene. Black constructs {{a profile of the}} man, and deduces that his <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> attacks on faith, believing that the killer has suffered a devastating loss which has caused him to lose his own faith. As the manhunt for the killer tightens, another cleric is tortured and killed; however, Black senses that the killer has returned to where his life fell apart. He and the police are able to identify the killer as Galen Calloway (Michael Zelniker), whose wife and daughter had been killed in a house fire several years earlier. Black knows the killer's next target will be the church that held the family's funeral.|$|E
5|$|Bonuses can {{be earned}} by {{achieving}} specific goals. If stunts or <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> repeated within a time limit, a score multiplier is earned and repeated actions boost the player's score further. Gameplay {{takes place in}} a single tropical jungle area, {{at the beginning of a}} game the jeep appears in a random location within the jungle. Stunt ramps are set up throughout the game area, along with the hills and valleys these facilitate long-distance jumps and other stunts. Each game takes four minutes, after the timer counts down to zero, the total score and any bonuses earned are shown. The player's ranking compared to other games played that day and the all-time highscores are also shown. Specific achievements can be gained by players, which are saved to their online profile, though the game can be played as a 'guest', which doesn't require a game profile to be created.|$|E
5|$|British philosopher Richard Swinburne {{proposed}} {{a version of}} the Irenaean theodicy based on his libertarian view of free will, a view that one's free <b>actions</b> <b>are</b> not caused by any outside agent. He argued that, in order for people to make free moral decisions, they must be aware of the consequences of such decisions. Knowledge of these consequences must be based on experience—Swinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing that humans would question its reliability. Swinburne argued that humans must have first hand experience of natural evil {{in order to understand the}} consequences of moral evil and that for God to give humans moral free will, he must allow human suffering. Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal physical punishment, and argued that people who had chosen to reject God throughout their lives would continue to do so after death.|$|E
