40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} confer optimal {{strength}} and stiffness to the graft in Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction, {{the maintenance of}} equal strand tension prior to fixation, is desired; positioning of the <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> can significantly affect strand tension This study aimed {{to determine the effect}} of <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> mal-positioning on individual strand tension in simulated cadaveric ACL reconstructions. Methods Twenty cadaveric specimens, comprising bovine tibia and tendon harvested from sheep, were used to simulate ACL reconstruction with a looped four-strand tendon graft. A proprietary <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> was used to tension the graft during tibial component fixation with graft tension recorded using load cells. The effects of the <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> at extreme angles, and in various locking states, was evaluated. Results Strand tension varied significantly when the <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> was held at extreme angles (p Conclusion An even distribution of tension among individual graft strands is obtained by maintaining the <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> in an unlocked state, aligned with the longitudinal axis of the tibial tunnel. If the maintenance of equal strand tension during tibial fixation of grafts is important, close attention must be paid to positioning of the <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> in order to optimize the resultant graft tension and, by implication, the strength and stiffness of the graft and ultimately, surgical outcome. </p...|$|R
40|$|The <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> is {{designed}} to pull the contact wire straight at all times. Pulling a contact wire straight ensures that smooth contact is maintained at all times between the contact wire and pantograph of an electric train, and this {{makes it possible to}} ensure a stable supply of electricity to the train. Normally, <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> are installed at two positions over a distance of 1 to 1. 6 km per line. Fig. 1 shows a conceptual view {{of the relationship between the}} contact wire and pulley type balancer. The <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> can be broadly classified into the two types; the wheel type <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> that pulls the contact wire by concrete or iron weights and the spring type <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> that use the force of a spring to pull it. Fig. 2 shows the wheel type balancer, while Fig. 3 represents the spring type balancer. The spring type <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> comprises a spring and a sleeve for accommodating the spring. Only the sleeve portion is visible to the outside. The wheel depends on gravity acting on the weight to produce tension, so it is possible to pull the contact wire at an almost uniform force, regardless of the height of the weight. In the spring type The wheel type <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> used in the Tohoku and Joetsu Shinkansen lines of JR East requires much time and labor for maintenance including wire replacement and oil application. Further, parts become superannuated and in need of periodic replacement very quickly. So we found it necessary to develop a new type of maintenance-free <b>tensioning</b> <b>device.</b> To accomplish this, we have been making efforts since 1999 to develop a new spring type <b>tensioning</b> <b>device</b> for Shinkansen, making effective use of the spring type balancer technologies used in the narrow gauge lines, where the major target is to develop a maintenance-free <b>tensioning</b> <b>device.</b> Thus, fairly satisfactory development results have been attained. This paper introduces and discusses this development...|$|R

50|$|A dynamic {{compression}} plate (DCP) is a metallic plate used in orthopedics for internal fixation of bone, typically after fractures. As the name implies, {{it is designed}} to exert dynamic pressure between the bone fragments to be transfixed. Dynamic compression is achieved either by attaching a <b>tension</b> <b>device</b> to a plate or by using a special {{dynamic compression}} plate. However, compression plating requires a longer surgical incision to allow insertion of the <b>tension</b> <b>device</b> and the possibility of refracture after the plate is removed. A neutralization plate is used to bridge a comminuted fracture; it also transmits bending or torsional forces from the proximal to the distal fragment. Plates used for buttressing prevent collapse by supporting an area of thin cortex or cancellous bone graft.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn the {{manufacture}} of cellular concrete products a string cutting of the raw material before autoclaving is widely used. The quality of cutting which represents {{the interaction of the}} string with a moving mass of the raw material is largely determined by the dynamics of the string deflection size Δх especially at the stage of its insertion and withdrawal from the material. So it is very relevant to stabilize Δх through the system of the <b>automatic</b> string <b>tension.</b> The structure of the proposed control system by the pneumatic cylinder, which is used as the power actuating <b>tensioning</b> <b>device,</b> is presented in this paper. The system contains two circuits. The inner circuit is closed by the pressure magnitude in the pneumatic cylinder, while the outer one by the axial force of the string measured with the strain sensor, which is structurally located between the pneumatic cylinder and the string. Itis shown that the use of such system increases the service life of the string and reduces deficiencies formed at the string withdrawal from the raw material...|$|R

40|$|Lasers {{are being}} used in various {{surgical}} proce- dures to remove tissue or bones, to coagulate vessels or other structures. Due to difficulties in handling {{only a limited number}} of surgeons manage to display sufficient levels of precision in Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) procedures. Prior works on robotic laser surgery demonstrated shorter learning curves and higher ablation precision, but unfortunately ignored the fact that most clinically relevant tasks are bi-manual by nature. Surgeons are also reluctant to use current commercial surgical robotic systems for complex laser tasks, indicating that the lack of haptic feedback prevents them from efficient and safe tissue handling in preparation of laser treatment. This paper expands earlier robotic laser work towards bi-manual operation. The paper introduces a system for precisely tensioning tissue that is being targeted by the laser. An artificial test-setup that captures some essential features of bimanual laser surgery is described. Experiments have been conducted to investigate the effect of haptic feedback on ablation performance. A comparison is made of achievable levels of ablation precision when there is no haptic feedback, when there is haptic feedback and when an <b>automatic</b> <b>tension</b> control algorithm is deployed. The conducted experimental results confirm the great potential of haptic feedback and <b>automatic</b> <b>tensioning</b> systems for complex bi-manual lasering tasks. status: publishe...|$|R
