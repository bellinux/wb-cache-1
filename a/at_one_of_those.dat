The magazine was saved {{by a group}} of sf fans who since 1946 had been meeting regularly on Thursday nights at the White Horse public house on New Fetter Lane, near Fleet Street. <b>At</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> meetings it was suggested that they form a company to revive New Worlds; one of those present, Frank Cooper, recently retired from the RAF, agreed to look into what would be necessary to start a new company.|$|E

25|$|Atterberg limits : The Atterberg limits {{define the}} {{boundaries}} of several states of consistency for plastic soils. The boundaries are defined {{by the amount of}} water a soil needs to be <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> boundaries. The boundaries are called the plastic limit and the liquid limit, and the difference between them is called the plasticity index. The shrinkage limit is also a part of the Atterberg limits. The results of this test can be used to help predict other engineering properties.|$|E

25|$|The Confederates marched west, {{heading toward}} Danville, Virginia or Lynchburg, Virginia as an alternative. Lee planned to {{resupply}} his army <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> cities and march southwest into North Carolina {{where he could}} unite his army with the Confederate army commanded by General Joseph E. Johnston. Grant's Union Army pursued Lee's fleeing Confederates relentlessly. During the next week, the Union troops fought a series of battles with Confederate units, cut off or destroyed Confederate supplies and blocked their paths {{to the south and}} ultimately to the west. On April 6, 1865, the Confederate Army suffered a significant defeat at the Battle of Sailor's Creek, Virginia, where they lost about 7,700 men killed and captured and an unknown number wounded. Nonetheless, Lee continued to move the remainder of his battered army to the west. Soon cornered, short of food and supplies and outnumbered, Lee surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia to Grant on April 9, 1865 at Appomattox Court House, Virginia.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of more victims sparked a massive police operation. Because several victims {{had been found}} at stations on one rail route through the Rostov Oblast, Viktor Burakov suggested a plan to saturate all larger stations in the Rostov Oblast with an obvious uniformed police presence which the killer could not fail to notice. The intention was to discourage the killer from attempting to strike at any of these locations, and to have undercover agents patrol smaller and less busy stations, where the murderer's activities {{would be more likely}} to be noticed. The plan was approved, and both the uniformed and undercover officers were instructed to question any adult man in the company of a young woman or child, and note his name and passport number. Police deployed 360 men at all the stations in the Rostov Oblast, but only undercover officers were posted at the three smallest stations on the route through the oblast where the killer had struck most frequently—Kirpichnaya, Donleskhoz, and Lesostep—in an effort to force the killer to strike <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> three stations. The operation was implemented on 27 October 1990.|$|E

500|$|Dworsky's {{first major}} {{commission}} was {{to design a}} basketball arena for his alma mater, the University of Michigan. The members of the 1947 Michigan Wolverines football team had reunions with Fritz Crisler every five years in Ann Arbor, and it was <b>at</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> reunions that Crisler (by then the school's athletic director) gave Dworsky one of his big breaks, asking him to design the arena. Built in 1967, the arena was named Crisler Arena, {{as a tribute to}} the coach. Dworsky's design of the arena was well received and was said to demonstrate [...] "his ability to combine majesty of scale with human accessibility". The roof of Crisler Arena is made of two plates, each weighing approximately 160tons. The bridge-like construction allows them to expand or contract given the change of seasons or the weight of the snow. Crisler Arena remains the home of Michigan's basketball team and houses memorabilia and trophies from all Wolverine varsity athletic teams.|$|E
