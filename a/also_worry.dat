25|$|Mexican state social {{investment}} depends to a {{great extent}} on the profits from oil exports controlled by Pemex as a state monopoly. The leftist political movement National Regeneration Movement has expressed concern that Pemex will be systematically excluded as a commercial competitor by the government. They believe that Pemex's infrastructural decline was due to a deliberate strategy of self-sabotage by the government through lack of reinvestment, and fear that the Mexican oil rent may be taken over by private corporations. The leftist opposition is concerned that energy reform may be a concealed maneuver for privatization. They <b>also</b> <b>worry</b> that laws derived from the constitutional reforms are not explicit in demonstrating that energy reform will avoid having the oil rent be controlled by the private sector. There are questions as to how the Mexican system of public health, education and subsidized transportation (not to mention the newly created presidential fund for retirement and umemployment) would be funded if there is privatization of the oil rent.|$|E

2500|$|Commenters have however {{pointed out}} that Israel had already promised to release these same 104 Palestinians, back in 1999 under the Sharm el-Sheikh Memorandum, but never did. Critics <b>also</b> <b>worry</b> that Israel will simply quietly re-arrest the {{potentially}} released Palestinians, and state that Israel is using the slow release to hold the negotiations hostage and that the main goal of the release is to bolster Israel's image. According to the Sharm el-Sheikh Fact-Finding Committee Report, Israel's decision not to release the prisoners {{at the time was}} due to significantly increased violence against Israel by their partner in the memorandum, the PLO, leading up to the Second Intifada. In the time leading up to the planned release, Israel perceived [...] "institutionalized anti-Israel, anti-Jewish incitement; the release from detention of terrorists; the failure to control illegal weapons; and the actual conduct of violent operations" [...] as a sign that [...] "the PLO has explicitly violated its renunciation of terrorism and other acts of violence, thereby significantly eroding trust between the parties." ...|$|E

50|$|Critics <b>also</b> <b>worry</b> {{that the}} {{existence}} of lower-yield nuclear weapons for relatively limited tactical purposes will lower the threshold for their actual use, thus blurring the sharp line between conventional weapons intended for use and weapons of mass destruction intended only for hypothetical deterrence, and increasing the risk of escalation to higher-yield nuclear weapons.|$|E

5000|$|Critics <b>also</b> <b>worry</b> that a constructivist {{approach}} to education leaves the learner too disconnected from reality since it constantly focuses on building new knowledge based on pre-existing knowledge.

[...] While this may be a weakness for many courses, in service-learning, students work to create real solutions for a real customer.

A high-profile report from the American Federation of Teachers (2002), for example, argued that many charter school authorizers have failed to hold the administrators and teachers accountable, leaving some students to languish in low-performing schools. Another concern of critics is that charters are more racially segregated than traditional public schools, thus denying students the educational [...] "benefits associated with attending diverse schools". Skeptics <b>also</b> <b>worry</b> that charter schools unfairly divert resources and policy attention from regular public schools.|$|E
