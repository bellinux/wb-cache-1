5|$|New Media {{consultant}} Glen Whitman {{stated in}} an interview that this particular episode contains some recent scientific developments that were part of their inspiration for the creation of Fringe in the first place. Specifically, Whitman is referring to the use of transgenics, which is the idea that there are organisms with genes from other species. Whitman concluded that they were partly inspired by scientists Osamu Shimomura, Martin Chalfie, and Roger Y. Tsien <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>work</b> on research on isolating genes from jellyfish for the treatment of Huntington's disease; all three won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.|$|E
5|$|By March 2008, the duo had {{recruited}} SebRochford to play drums with Byrne in New York City. Later that month, multi-instrumentalist {{and previous}} Eno collaborator LeoAbrahams was enlisted to perform guitar, percussion instruments, and piano in his London home studio. Abrahams and Rochford would continue {{working on the}} tracks in Abrahams' studio through May <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>work</b> was e-mailed to other collaborators—Byrne attended one session to play guitar. Other musicians worked with Byrne in NewYorkCity and Eno in London, such as frequent Byrne collaborator MauroRefosco, Eno's daughters Darla and Irial, and JarvisCocker of Pulp, who added uncredited guitar in London. The duo attempted to record {{as much of the}} music from home studios as possible and played almost all instrumentation themselves, saving the drums and percussion for the studio. In addition to the tracks that were released, the musicians had some other instrumentals that Byrne did not complete.|$|E

5|$|In 1905, Albert Einstein {{published}} his paper On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies about special relativity. Born was intrigued, and began researching the subject. He was devastated {{to discover that}} Minkowski was also researching special relativity along the same lines, but when he wrote to Minkowski about his results, Minkowski asked {{him to return to}} Göttingen and do his habilitation there. Born accepted. Toeplitz helped Born brush up on his matrix algebra so he could work with the four-dimensional Minkowski space matrices used in the latter's project to reconcile relativity with electrodynamics. Born and Minkowski got along well, <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>work</b> made good progress, but Minkowski died suddenly of appendicitis on 12 January 1909. The mathematics students had Born speak on their behalf at the funeral.|$|E
5|$|In 1999 Kelly {{formed the}} band Professor Ratbaggy with Hadley (bass guitar, backing vocals), Haymes (keyboards, organ, backing vocals) and Luscombe (drums). Kelly {{provided}} guitars and vocals for their debut album, Professor Ratbaggy, on EMI Records. Songs were written jointly by all group members <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>work</b> {{was a more}} groove-oriented style compared to Kelly's usual folk or rock formula, using samples, synthesiser and percussion. Kelly's second anthology of lyrics entitled Don't Start Me Talking {{was first published in}} 1999, with subsequent songs appended in the 2004 edition. This second edition was added to the Victorian Certificate of Education English reading list for Year 12 (final year of secondary schooling) in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Super Mario Bros. {{was released}} in North America in October 1985. Within four months, it had sold {{tens of millions of}} Nintendo Entertainment System (Famicom in Japan) video game consoles and signaled the end of the 1983 video game crash. When developing a version of the game for Nintendo's coin-operated arcade machine, the VS. System, the team experimented with new, challenging level designs. They enjoyed these new levels, and thought that Super Mario devotees would too. Shigeru Miyamoto, who created the Mario franchise and directed Super Mario Bros., no longer had time to design games by himself, given his responsibilities leading Nintendo's R division <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>work</b> on The Legend of Zelda. Thus, the Super Mario sequel was delegated to its predecessor's assistant director, Takashi Tezuka, as his directorial debut. He worked with Miyamoto and the R team to develop a sequel based on the same underlying technology, including some levels directly from Vs. Super Mario Bros.|$|E
