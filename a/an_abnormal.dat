5|$|A {{brain tumor}} is <b>an</b> <b>abnormal</b> growth of cells within the brain or inside the skull, {{and can be}} {{cancerous}} (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). Just over half of all primary brain tumors are malignant; the rest are benign, though they may still be life-threatening. In the United States in 2000, survivors of benign primary brain tumors outnumbered those who had cancerous primary brain tumors by approximately 4:1. Metastatic brain cancer is over six times more common than primary brain cancer, as it occurs in about 10–30% of all people with cancer.|$|E
5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} (collapsed lung) is <b>an</b> <b>abnormal</b> {{collection of}} {{air in the}} pleural space that causes an uncoupling of the lung from the chest wall. The lung cannot expand against the air pressure inside the pleural space. An easy to understand example is a traumatic pneumothorax, where air enters the pleural space from outside the body, as occurs with puncture to the chest wall. Similarly, a scuba diver ascending while holding their breath with their lungs fully inflated can cause air sacs (alveoli) to burst and leak high pressure air into the pleural space.|$|E

5|$|In epileptic {{seizures}} a {{group of}} neurons begin firing in <b>an</b> <b>abnormal,</b> excessive, and synchronized manner. This results {{in a wave of}} depolarization known as a paroxysmal depolarizing shift. Normally, after an excitatory neuron fires it becomes more resistant to firing for a period of time.

5|$|Potassium ions are {{necessary}} for the function of all living cells. The transfer of potassium ions through nerve cell membranes is necessary for normal nerve transmission; potassium deficiency and excess can each result in numerous abnormalities, including <b>an</b> <b>abnormal</b> heart rhythm and various electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities. Fresh fruits and vegetables are good dietary sources of potassium. The body responds to the influx of dietary potassium, which raises serum potassium levels, with a shift of potassium from outside to inside cells {{and an increase in}} potassium excretion by the kidneys.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{sometimes}} {{refer to}} Parkinson’s disease as a synucleiopathy (due to <b>an</b> <b>abnormal</b> accumulation of alpha-synuclein protein in the brain) to {{distinguish it from}} other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease where the brain accumulates tau protein. Considerable clinical and pathological overlap exists between tauopathies and synucleinopathies. In contrast to Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease presents most commonly with memory loss, and the cardinal signs of Parkinson's disease (slowness, tremor, stiffness, and postural instability) are not normal features of Alzheimer's.|$|E
40|$|International audienceObjectives: Inflammation, {{measured}} by abnormal blood C-reactive protein ă (CRP) level, {{has been described}} in schizophrenia (SZ), being ă inconsistently related to impaired cognitive functions. The aim of the ă present study is to investigate cognitive impairment associated with <b>ă</b> <b>abnormal</b> CRP levels in a large multi-centric sample of ă community-dwelling SZ patients, using a comprehensive neuropsychological ă battery. Method: Three hundred sixty-nine community-dwelling stable SZ ă subjects (76. 2 % men, mean age 32. 7 y) were included and tested with a ă comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests. <b>Abnormal</b> CRP level <b>ă</b> was defined as > 3 mg/L. Results: Multiple factor analysis revealed that <b>ă</b> <b>abnormal</b> CRP levels, found in 104 patients (28. 2 %), were associated ă with impaired General Intellectual Ability and Abstract Reasoning (aOR = ă 0. 56, 95 % CI 0. 35 - 0. 90, P =. 014), independently of age, sex, education ă level, psychotic symptomatology, treatments, and addiction <b>ă</b> comorbidities. <b>Abnormal</b> CRP levels were also associated with the decline ă of all components of working memory (respectively effect size [ES] = ă 0. 25, P =. 033; ES = 0. 27, P =. 04; ES = 0. 33, P =. 006; and ES = 0. 38, ă P =. 004) and {{a wide range of}} other impaired cognitive functions, ă including memory (ES = 0. 26, P =. 026), learning abilities (ES = 0. 28, P ă =. 035), semantic memory (ES = 0. 26, P =. 026), mental flexibility (ES = ă 0. 26, P =. 044), visual attention (ES = 0. 23, P =. 004) and speed of ă processing (ES = 0. 23, P =. 043). Conclusion: Our results suggest that <b>ă</b> <b>abnormal</b> CRP level is associated with cognitive impairment in SZ. ă Evaluating the effectiveness of neuroprotective anti-inflammatory ă strategies is needed in order to prevent cognitive impairment in SZ...|$|R

5|$|The dacite volcanics {{composing}} Mount Fee contain brown {{volcanic glass}} {{as much as}} 70% and vesicular textures as much as 15%. About 25% of the volcanics contain crystal content, including plagioclase, hornblende, orthopyroxene, orthoclase and sporadic quartz. The orthoclase crystals are interpreted to represent rock fragments that became enveloped during hardening of the dacitic lavas.

They are therefore counselled to avoid scuba diving, during which small air bubbles may form in the bloodsteam that may migrate to the brain and cause stroke. Similarly, antimicrobial prophylaxis is advised during procedures in which bacteria may enter the bloodstream, such as dental work, and avoidance of air bubbles during intravenous therapy.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the most}} common {{congenital}} malformations affecting the esophagus are an esophageal atresia where the oesophagus ends in a blind sac instead of connecting to the stomach; and an esophageal fistula – <b>an</b> <b>abnormal</b> connection between the esophagus and the trachea. Both of these conditions usually occur together. These are found in about 1 in 3500 births. Half of these cases may be part of a syndrome where other abnormalities are also present, particularly of the heart or limbs. The other cases occur singly.|$|E

5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} is <b>an</b> <b>abnormal</b> {{collection of}} {{air in the}} pleural space between the lung and the chest wall. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. In a minority of cases the amount of air in the chest increases when a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, leading to a tension pneumothorax. This condition can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure. Unless reversed by effective treatment, it can result in death. Very rarely both lungs may be affected by a pneumothorax. It is often called a collapsed lung, although that term may also refer to atelectasis.|$|E
5|$|Good {{conformation}} in {{the limbs}} leads to improved movement and decreased likelihood of injuries. Large differences in bone structure and size {{can be found}} in horses used for different activities, but correct conformation remains relatively similar across the spectrum. Structural defects, as well as other problems such as injuries and infections, can cause lameness, or movement at <b>an</b> <b>abnormal</b> gait. Injuries to and problems with horse legs can be relatively minor, such as stocking up, which causes swelling without lameness, or quite serious. Even non-fatal leg injuries can be fatal to horses, as their bodies are designed to bear weight on all four legs and serious problems can result if this is not possible.|$|E
5|$|HD {{affects the}} whole brain, but certain areas are more {{vulnerable}} than others. The most prominent early effects are {{in a part of}} the basal ganglia called the neostriatum, which is composed of the caudate nucleus and putamen. Other areas affected include the substantia nigra, layers 3, 5 and 6 of the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, purkinje cells in the cerebellum, lateral tuberal nuclei of the hypothalamus and parts of the thalamus. These areas are affected according to their structure and the types of neurons they contain, reducing in size as they lose cells. Striatal spiny neurons are the most vulnerable, particularly ones with projections towards the external globus pallidus, with interneurons and spiny cells projecting to the internal pallidum being less affected. HD also causes <b>an</b> <b>abnormal</b> increase in astrocytes and activation of the brain's immune cells, microglia.|$|E
