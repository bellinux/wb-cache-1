5|$|By mid-morning, Hotze's <b>advanced</b> <b>guard</b> had {{encountered}} moderate French resistance first from Roget's brigade, and then, almost immediately, from Gazan's. The Austrian advance troops quickly overran Gazan's weak brigade and took {{possession of the}} woods surrounding the village of Islikon. After securing the villages of Gundeschwil, Schottikon, Wiesendangen, and Stogen, further west of Islikon, Hotze deployed two of his columns facing the French front, while a third angled to the French right, as Ney had expected he would.|$|E
5|$|The <b>advanced</b> <b>guard</b> of the Turks {{arrived at}} on 2 August 1566 and the {{defenders}} made several successful sorties causing considerable {{loss to the}} Turks. The Sultan arrived with the main force on 5 August and his big war tent was erected on the Similehov hill, giving him {{a view of the}} battle. The Sultan had to stay in his camp where he received verbal battle progress reports from his Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha, the real operational commander of the Ottoman forces.|$|E
5|$|Latour led the 3rd Column {{which was}} {{organized}} into an <b>Advanced</b> <b>Guard</b> under Canisius and three brigades directed by Kerpen, Liechtenstein and Württemberg. Canisius commanded three battalions of the Franz Kinsky Nr. 47 Infantry Regiment, four companies from the Serbian and three companies of the Slavonian Infantry Regiments, six squadrons of the Lobkowitz Chevau-légers Nr. 28, four squadrons of the Szekler Hussars and two squadrons of the Coburg Dragoons Nr. 37. Kerpen led three battalions of the Alton Nr. 15 Infantry Regiment and the Bideskuty, Szenassy and Benjowski Grenadier Battalions. Liechtenstein controlled three squadrons of the Kaiser Dragoons Nr. 1. Württemberg directed six squadrons of the Mack Nr. 20 and four squadrons of the Ansbach Nr. 33 Cuirassiers.|$|E

5|$|He was wrong; the Austrians {{engaged with}} the French <b>advance</b> <b>guard</b> {{numbered}} closer to 50,000, and constituted {{the main body}} of Charles' army, not its <b>advance</b> <b>guard.</b> In the night, Charles also had moved additional troops to renew the attack on the Pfullendorf heights at daybreak.|$|R

5|$|On 20 September, the 17th and 122nd French Colonial Divisions {{along with}} the 1st Serbian Army crossed river Crna. News of a {{breakthrough}} at Dobro Pole prompted the defenders of Doiran to abandon their positions and rush {{to the defense of}} their homeland, in order to prevent a future occupation by the Entente. On 21 September, the Allies became aware of the Bulgarian withdrawal after observing a series of fires and munition dump explosions on the Bulgarian positions, a pursuit by the British XII Corps was launched immediately. The Serbian <b>advanced</b> <b>guard</b> approached Krivolak, thus creating a wedge between the 1st Bulgarian and 11th German Armies in an effort to force the latter to retire towards Albania. The 2nd Bulgarian Army headed towards the Kosturino Pass avoiding direct engagement with the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{vary greatly}} on the {{relative}} strength of the Russian and Austrian armies. Saltykov had started the summer with a force of about 60,000 men; he had lost close to 4,000 at the Battle of Kay. Laudon had been detached from the main Austrian army with 22–24,000 men, and sent north to support the Russian cause. A portion of the Russian force remained in Frankfurt as the Allied <b>advanced</b> <b>guard.</b> Saltykov had expected the Austrian commander-in-chief's entire army to arrive; instead a mere wing under Laudon's command came to his aid. Their collaboration was complicated by their personalities. Neither Laudon nor Saltykov had great command of operational arts. Saltykov did not like foreigners; Laudon thought Saltykov was inscrutable. Neither liked conversing through translators, and both mistrusted each other's intentions.|$|E
5|$|Sztáray {{commanded}} the 2nd Column {{which consisted of}} an <b>Advanced</b> <b>Guard</b> under Devay, two brigades led by Latour-Merlemont and the Prince of Lorraine and two unbrigaded mounted units, four squadrons each of the Archduke John Dragoons Nr. 26 and Waldeck Dragoons. Devay led two battalions of the Pellegrini Nr. 49 Infantry Regiment, one battalion each of the Splenyi Nr. 51 and Serbian Infantry Regiments, seven squadrons of the Archduke Ferdinand Hussars and six squadrons of the Kinsky Chevau-légers Nr. 7. Latour-Merlemont commanded three battalions of the Manfredini Nr. 12 Infantry Regiment and the Candiani, Dietrich, Reisingen and Warren Grenadier Battalions. Lorraine directed four squadrons each of the Kavanaugh Nr. 12 and Archduke Franz Nr. 29 Cuirassiers.|$|E

5|$|The 5th Cavalry Division's {{remaining}} brigade; the 13th Cavalry Brigade reached Nazareth at 05:30, {{having been}} weakened by diversions {{and a number}} of detachments. One squadron of 9th Hodson's Horse had lost touch during the night march. Two troops of lancers were clearing the village of Yafa. The 18th Lancers surrounded and captured 200 sleeping Ottoman soldiers in the village of El Mujeidil at 03:30, which they had mistaken for Nazareth. While the rest of the brigade were collecting prisoners, the only unit available to attack Nazareth, the Gloucester Hussars, was ordered to take over the <b>advanced</b> <b>guard</b> and attack Nazareth, closely followed by one squadron and three troops of the 18th Lancers.|$|E
5|$|The army {{advanced}} in four columns. First Division, the right wing, assembled at Hüningen, crossed at Basel and advanced eastward {{along the north}} shore of the Rhine toward Lake Constance. The <b>Advanced</b> <b>Guard</b> crossed at Kehl, and Vandamme led it north-east through the mountains via Freudenstadt. This column eventually became the left flank. It was followed across the Rhine, also at Kehl, by the II. Division. The Third Division and the Reserve also crossed at Kehl, and then divided into two columns, III. Division traveling through the Black Forest via Oberkirch, and the Reserve, with most of the artillery and horse, further south via the valley at Freiburg im Breisgau, where they would find more forage, and then over the mountains past the Titisee to Löffingen and Hüfingen.|$|E
5|$|By 11:04, Lindmayr's Dorniers {{had reached}} Calais. Wing Commander Lord Willoughby de Broke, Park’s senior fighter controller, watched with the Prime Minister and Park as the Germans moved closer. De Broke {{had a problem}} of his own. He {{had no way of}} knowing which plots {{represented}} bombers and fighters. Bombers had to be intercepted, fighters could be ignored. The trick was to strike a balance and time the interception as well as possible. On one hand he must scramble early and allow enough time to get into a favourable attack position; but on the other hand he had to avoid scrambling them too early lest the fighters run short of fuel before they met the enemy. Park joined de Broke. After a brief discussion he decided to commit several squadrons from RAF Biggin Hill. Park realised the raid could be a trap. Though the target seemed to be London, the aircraft, comprising 120–150 in number, may be an <b>advanced</b> <b>guard</b> of Bf 109s sent to clear the skies or disrupt fighter defences. Still, he gambled and sent nine squadrons into action at 11:15.|$|E
5|$|The cavalry {{continued}} with {{its plan to}} attack. Paxton sent the regiment's <b>advance</b> <b>guard,</b> led by Major Powell, down the mountain to scout the rebel camps in Sinking Creek Valley. Each man in the 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry's 22-man <b>advance</b> <b>guard</b> was armed with two six-shot revolvers and a saber. The <b>advance</b> <b>guard</b> discovered that the rebels in the first camp were focused on staying warm, and many did not have their one-shot muskets loaded. Powell and his <b>advance</b> <b>guard</b> {{decided to try to}} capture the camp by themselves, and were successful in persuading a 500-man rebel camp to surrender. Rebel weapons were destroyed, and over 100 prisoners on horses were brought up the mountain to the remaining portion of the regiment. Union casualties in the raid were 2 horses killed.|$|R

5|$|By 23March, Jourdan had his {{headquarters}} {{in the vicinity of}} Stockach. He had recalled Barthélemy Ferino from the far right flank; Ferino had retreated along the coast of the Überlingen Lake, the northwestern finger of Lake Constance, to be in position at the close right flank, adjacent to Souham's division. Lefebvre, wounded at Ostrach, was unable to take the field himself, and Laurent Saint Cyr commanded the left flank. When Jourdan considered his position, he felt it too extended, so he drew back further behind Stockach, toward Engen, where he could concentrate his force. The first division camped near the Hohentwiel, the 11th-century fortress overlooking the marshes at the westernmost point of the Lake Constance. The second division, the <b>advanced</b> <b>guard,</b> and a cavalry division were camped on the heights above Engen. The third division was camped by Leibtengen (Liptingen, the French called it), and Neuhausen. Vandamme and his small corps worked themselves discreetly into a position behind the Austrian right flank. Jourdan established {{his headquarters}} at Engen.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} was mobilised in August 1914 in the 1st South Western Mounted Brigade, but did {{not proceed}} to France until December 1915. In May 1916, two squadrons joined the XV Corps cavalry unit, with two further squadrons joining IX Corps Cavalry regiment. During 1916–17, duties mainly involved policing, traffic control, despatch riding and similar activities. In March 1917, the regiment played its only part in the War as horsed cavalry, during the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line. Over an eleven-day period, German forces retreated 20–25 miles to prepared positions. The RWY formed part of the <b>advanced</b> <b>guard</b> of the British Army, attempting {{to keep in touch}} with the German rearguards, but this was difficult owing to the broken nature of the ground behind the original German lines. Contact was made several times with Uhlans and a lance captured in one of these engagements is still in possession of the regiment.|$|E
5|$|Soubise has {{historically}} taken {{the blame for}} the loss, but this may be an unfair assessment. While he did owe his rank to his good relationship with Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of King Louis XV, he was neither blessed with extraordinary military acumen nor with the best troops: he could do nothing about the former, and most of the latter were with Louis Charles César Le Tellier, fighting in the Rhineland. Under Soubise's command, the French had conducted a notorious march across Germany, characterized by persistent pillaging. His army also had approximately 12,000 civilian camp followers. There were chefs, hair dressers, perruquiers, barbers, wives and mistresses, pastry chefs, tailors and clothiers of all kinds, saddle makers, bridle makers, grooms, and servants of all varieties who served the nobility. In addition, the army had its usual motley crew of farriers, grooms, veterinarians, surgeons, and cooks that sustained an army on the march. After the battle, the Comte de Saint Germain, who had commanded the <b>advanced</b> <b>guard</b> and also the rear guard that struggled {{to keep up with the}} fleeing army, complained that the troops in his charge had been defective, a gang of robbers, murders, and cowards who ran at the sound of a gunshot.|$|E
25|$|Pyrrhus sent an <b>advance</b> <b>guard</b> to Tarentum {{under the}} command of Cineaus with 3,000 infantry.

After his early success on the march Pyrrhus entered Tarentum to rejoin with his <b>advance</b> <b>guard.</b>|$|R

25|$|Charbonnier {{received}} his orders on 6 May and immediately held a conference with Desjardin, François Séverin Marceau-Desgraviers and their {{chiefs of staff}} where they drew up plans for the offensive. Shortly afterward, Charbonnier wanted to delay {{in order to get}} clearer instructions from Pichegru, but Desjardin emphasized that their orders were plain. In preparation, Charbonnier divided his 17,000-man field force into two divisions under Jacob and Marceau plus an independent detachment under Claude Vezú. The two divisions and Hardy's <b>advanced</b> <b>guard</b> were grouped into a corps under Marceau's tactical direction. For his part, Desjardin commanded three divisions, his own and those of Éloi Laurent Despeaux and Jacques Fromentin plus an <b>advanced</b> <b>guard</b> under Guillaume Philibert Duhesme. François Muller took over Desjardin's former division.|$|E
25|$|In August 1813, Hiller's army {{consisted}} of an <b>Advanced</b> <b>Guard</b> under General-major Aron Stanisavlevics and divisions commanded by Feldmarschall-Leutnants Peter Marchal de Perclat, Johann Maria Philipp Frimont, Franz Marziani, Hannibal Sommariva, and Paul von Radivojevich. The <b>Advanced</b> <b>Guard</b> had two Grenz infantry battalions and two hussar squadrons. Marchal's division {{was made up}} of a light brigade of one jäger and one Grenz battalion and four hussar squadrons under General-major Christoph Ludwig von Eckhardt and a brigade of four line battalions under General-major Timotheus Winczian. Frimont's division had three brigades led by General-majors Franjo Vlašić, Ferdinand Daniel Pulszky, and August von Vécsey. Vlašić's light brigade comprised one jäger and one Grenz battalion and six hussar squadrons, Pulszky's brigade {{consisted of}} four line battalions, and Vécsey's cavalry brigade had 12 squadrons of uhlans.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Advance</b> <b>Guard</b> {{crossed the}} Rhine River at Kehl, and {{marched to the}} northeast.

Vandamme had been lobbying with Jourdan for a larger and more important command but, given the claims of other officers, {{this was the best}} Jourdan could do for him. Vandamme led the <b>Advance</b> <b>Guard</b> through the mountains via Freudenstadt. On 5 March, Lefebvre returned to his command. Within a week, part of the <b>advance</b> <b>guard</b> broke off from the main body and, under command of Vandamme, moved to Stuttgart, to investigate the rumored presence of Habsburg units.|$|R

25|$|Dohna {{distinguished}} {{himself not}} only in the war against Austria, but subsequently in the first two of Frederick's three Silesian Wars. By 1751 he commanded the <b>advanced</b> <b>guard</b> of the Lehwaldt corps against the Russians at the first meeting at Groß-Jägersdorf, where he was wounded. Dohna was awarded the Order of the Black Eagle in 1753 and also promoted to lieutenant general in January of that year.|$|E
25|$|On 10 April, Albert Gyulay's VIII Armeekorps {{advanced}} from Tarvisio (Tarvis) and {{two days}} later it occupied Udine. Near the latter city, he was joined by his brother's corps which had marched from Ljubljana (Laibach). French reconnaissance was poor and the opposing army commander, Eugène de Beauharnais remained unaware that the VIII and IX Armeekorps had joined forces. Meanwhile, Archduke John formed a third maneuver unit, an army <b>Advance</b> <b>Guard</b> and placed it {{under the command of}} Johann Maria Philipp Frimont. The <b>Advance</b> <b>Guard</b> was created from Frimont's 2nd Division of the VIII Armeekorps. John ordered a night march on the evening of the 14th, Frimont's <b>Advance</b> <b>Guard</b> leading, followed by the VIII Armeekorps, while the IX brought up the rear. Frimont caught Eugène's own <b>advance</b> <b>guard</b> at Pordenone on the morning of 15 April and defeated it.
