5|$|Just before junior prom, Jesse returns, having flunked out of UCLA, and Rachel invites him to {{the prom}} with her, Sam and Mercedes (Amber Riley). Jesse and Finn are {{kicked out of the}} prom when Finn picks a fight with Jesse over his attentions to Rachel on the dance floor, which {{effectively}} ends Finn and Quinn's campaign for prom king and queen. Finn ultimately breaks up with Quinn when he realizes he has a deeper connection with Rachel, {{despite the fact that she}} and Jesse seem to be a couple again. At Nationals, as the New Directions are <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> stage, Finn begs Rachel to get back together with him, but though she professes her love, she refuses, still torn between her love for New York and Broadway and her love for him. At the end of their duet—"Pretending", written by Finn—an enthusiastic audience falls silent when Rachel and Finn share an overlong, unscripted kiss; the glee club comes in twelfth. Back in Ohio, Finn reminds Rachel that she has a year until graduation and any move to New York; he kisses her, and their relationship resumes.|$|E
