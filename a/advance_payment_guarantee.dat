40|$|The cost of {{interest}} <b>payment</b> <b>guarantees</b> {{is difficult to}} evaluate because guarantees are a contingent obligation that become effective only if a certain condition is met (that is, the debtor fails to make a certain payment). In this paper a technique to value interest <b>payment</b> <b>guarantees</b> on developing country debt is developed and preliminary estimates are presented. Using results from option pricing theory, the market price that an interest <b>payment</b> <b>guarantee</b> would have if it were traded in financial markets is estimated from the characteristics of secondary market prices of developing country debt. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} was conducted to evaluate the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> methods in the construction sector. Data were collected from different contractors, consultants & clients to analyses the contractor's financing state {{and the effect of}} the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> methods on the contractor's finance. Interviews and the documentary research are the two methods adopted for the data collection. From the data analysed during this research {{it is clear that the}} almost of all contractors are facing to cash flow problems during the projects. The existing <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> practice of providing 20 % advance at the beginning of the project is not sufficient to overcome these cash flow problems. Therefore improvement in the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> system is urgently required for the development of the construction sector in Sri Lanka. The main conclusions of the research were that a better <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> proposal couldn't be generalize. The three advance payment" proposals considered in the research were: A. Providing <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> of 20 % at the beginning. B. 20 % advance at the beginning and another 10 % advance at the middle third of the project; and C. Providing 20 % advance & the material advances for the main construction materials. The suitable <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> proposal has a greater bearing on the variable factors for the contractors finance. These variable factors and their effect on each of these <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> proposals are analysed and presented. By observing in to the data analysed it's clear that the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> system for each and every contract, must be decided by considering limitations of the contractors finance. Presently the client & the consultant decide the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> method. But this system has to be modified, as the contractor will be able to request for his preferred <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> option. By looking in to the other possible alternatives available for the contractors,(for to find the finance); going for his preferred <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> system is profitable for the contractor even after allowing of a discount to the client. Therefore the existing <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> system can be used to improve the contractors finance without increasing the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> percentage. However allowing the selection of the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> option to the contractor may create an another difficulty in evaluation of the contracts at the tendering stage. If the request for discount percentages, for each and every <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> option &their modifications (Delayed <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> recovery or reduced payback period) are included in the tender document the evaluation of the tender can be done under the grounds of equity...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{determine}} that how far is the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> needed to ensure the smooth running of construction works. A questionnaire survey was used {{to carry out the}} study. The questionnaire consists of 10 factors that bring to the needs of <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> in smoothing the construction works. The level of importance factors was measured and the relative importance of weights was ranked. The scope of study is limited to contractor firms, developer companies and consultants firms in the Penang Island, Butterworth (main land) and Taiping, Perak are located. The study found that, to prevent the delay of works is the main factor and to speed up the progress of works is the second most important factor by providing the <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> in construction projects. The results were analyzed to rank the need of <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> to ensure the smoothing of construction works. Based on the analysis of the ranking and intensity of the needs of <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> in construction works, this paper suggest possible improvements that could be in order to increase the construction performance by providing the <b>advance</b> <b>payment...</b>|$|R

50|$|This case {{highlights}} {{an ambiguous}} {{area in the}} U.S. tax codeâ€™s treatment of deposits. The code treats <b>advance</b> <b>payments</b> and loans differently. Generally, the full amount of an <b>advance</b> <b>payment</b> for services is taxable income to the recipient in the year received. This is true even if the services extend beyond the taxable year. However, a loan is not gross income to the recipient.

There are some case studies about L/C?s discrepancies that may happen because of human error and less knowledge about L/C. The use of Letter of Credit is very helpful for international transactions. As the time goes by, {{there will be more}} people use L/C for their transactions.

40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} determination {{as to whether}} the Mobilization <b>Advance</b> <b>Payment</b> is actually necessary in the Sri Lankan construction industry, its effect on contractors' cash flow and whether it is a motivation for the contractors. Accurate cash flow forecasting is essential to all contractors in the construction Industry for successful operation and existence in the long run. At initial stages of a project the cash flow aspect of the contractor is negative. The main role of project financing is to cover up this negative flow in a beneficial, cost effective manner. Mobilization <b>Advance</b> <b>Payment</b> enhances the quality and productivity in the construction industry. It improves the performance and cost efficiency of the contractors as well as the clients. Cash data in relation to thirty projects were collected. Three criteria, no Mobilization Advance, 20 % of the initial contract sum as the Mobilization Advance paid at the inception of the project and 20 % of the initial contract sum as Mobilization Advance given in stages, were identified to determine the differences in the effects of cash flow. The effect of these different criteria on the cumulative cash flow was examined. Further Scheduled Performance Index was calculated for further analysis. Results show and confirm that Mobilization <b>Advance</b> <b>Payment</b> has a big bearing on the contractors' existence and their motivation towards attaining objectives of the project. Research confirms that Mobilization <b>Advance</b> <b>Payment</b> is a necessity in the Sri Lankan construction industry. Further it can be confirmed that the provision of Mobilization <b>Advance</b> <b>Payment</b> is very essential for the Sri Lankan contractors.
