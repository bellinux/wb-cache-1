5|$|Fishermen have {{traditionally}} used seabirds <b>as</b> <b>indicators</b> of both fish shoals, underwater banks that might indicate fish stocks, and of potential landfall. In fact, the known association of seabirds with land {{was instrumental in}} allowing the Polynesians to locate tiny landmasses in the Pacific. Seabirds have provided food for fishermen away from home, as well as bait. Famously, tethered cormorants {{have been used to}} catch fish directly. Indirectly, fisheries have also benefited from guano from colonies of seabirds acting as fertilizer for the surrounding seas.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} and arterial gas embolism in recreational diving {{are associated with}} certain demographic, environmental, and dive style factors. A statistical study published in 2005 tested potential risk factors: age, gender, body mass index, smoking, asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, previous decompression illness, years since certification, dives in the last year, number of diving days, number of dives in a repetitive series, last dive depth, nitrox use, and drysuit use. No significant associations with risk of decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism were found for asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, smoking, or body mass index. Increased depth, previous DCI, larger number of consecutive days diving, and being male were associated with higher risk for decompression {{sickness and}} arterial gas embolism. Nitrox and drysuit use, greater frequency of diving in the past year, increasing age, and years since certification were associated with lower risk, possibly <b>as</b> <b>indicators</b> of more extensive training and experience.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to their}} habitat specificity, {{many species of}} beetles have been {{suggested}} as suitable <b>as</b> <b>indicators,</b> their presence, numbers, or absence providing a measure of habitat quality. Predatory beetles such as the tiger beetles (Cicindelidae) have found scientific use as an indicator taxon for measuring regional patterns of biodiversity. They are suitable for this as their taxonomy is stable; their life history is well described; they are large and simple to observe when visiting a site; they occur {{around the world in}} many habitats, with species specialised to particular habitats; and their occurrence by species accurately indicates other species, both vertebrate and invertebrate. According to the habitats, many other groups such as the rove beetles in human-modified habitats, dung beetles in savannas and saproxylic beetles in forests have been suggested as potential indicator species.|$|E
5|$|Terns have {{sometimes}} benefited from human activities, following the plough or fishing boats for easy food supplies, although some birds get trapped in nets or swallow plastic. Fishermen looked for feeding tern flocks, since the birds could {{lead them to}} fish shoals. Overfishing of small fish such as sand eels can lead to steep declines in the colonies relying on these prey items. More generally, the loss or disruption to tern colonies caused by human activities has caused declines in many species. Pollution {{has been a problem}} in some areas, and in the 1960s and 1970s DDT caused egg loss through thinning of the shells. In the 1980s, organochlorides caused severe declines in the Great Lakes area of the US. Because of their sensitivity to pollutants, terns are sometimes used <b>as</b> <b>indicators</b> of contamination levels.|$|E

40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{adversely}} affecting wildlife species. Species are affected differently {{due to the}} different ways they respond to climate change stresses. Terrestrial large mammals have not often been considered <b>as</b> potential <b>indicators</b> of climate change impacts. This research identified potential terrestrial large mammals <b>as</b> a possible <b>indicator</b> species for climate change effects, and analysed their implications for climate change adaptation policy in Tanzania. Desktop analysis and survey questionnaires were used to gather information and showed that some terrestrial large mammals could be used <b>as</b> <b>indicator</b> species for climate change effects in Tanzania. Both the desktop analysis and survey questionnaire revealed highly water dependent species (hippopotamus and waterbuck) and migratory species (wildebeest) <b>as</b> potential <b>indicator</b> species for climate change effects in Tanzania. Both academic and field ecologists regarded the African elephant highly <b>as</b> potential <b>indicator</b> species for climate change in Tanzania. This suggests that climate change adaptation policy in Tanzania should prioritize the use of hippopotamus, waterbuck, African elephant, and wildebeest <b>as</b> <b>indicator</b> species for climate change effects.

Within the HR model, unpleasant feelings or emotions, or stressful feelings, indicate that one's thinking is based on insecurity, negative beliefs, conditioning or learned patterns that are not necessarily appropriate to the live moment here and now. They simultaneously indicate that the individual has temporarily lost sight of what HR asserts is his or her own role in creating experience. Pleasant or desired feelings (such as a sense of well-being, gratitude, compassion, peace, etc.) indicate, within the HR model, that the quality of one's thinking is exactly as it needs to be.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species of}} birds have been driven to {{extinction}} by human activities. Being conspicuous elements of the ecosystem, they have been considered <b>as</b> <b>indicators</b> of ecological health. They have also helped in gathering support for habitat conservation. Bird conservation requires specialized knowledge in aspects of biology, ecology and may {{require the use of}} very location specific approaches. Ornithologists contribute to conservation biology by studying the ecology of birds in the wild and identifying the key threats and ways of enhancing the survival of species. Critically endangered species such as the California condor have had to be captured and bred in captivity. Such ex-situ conservation measures may be followed by re-introduction of the species into the wild.|$|E

25|$|From {{the thirteenth}} century, the Middle English plural pronouns 'ye' (nominative) and 'you' (accusative) {{were used to}} address single {{individuals}} in upper-class or courtly contexts. As a result, there were two sets of second-person singular pronouns, and the alternative singular pronouns 'thou' (nominative) and 'thee' (accusative) became increasingly associated with lower status. These distinctions had become established indices of social status by the fifteenth century, and they also developed <b>as</b> <b>indicators</b> of interpersonal relationships at this time: 'you' might show emotional distance or {{be used in a}} public setting, 'thou' familiarity/intimacy in a private setting.

The major issue in all these indicators is comparing any future projections against current law vs. what the actuaries expect to happen. For example, current law specifies that Part A payments to hospitals and skilled nursing facilities will be cut substantially after 2028 and that doctors will get no raises after 2025.
