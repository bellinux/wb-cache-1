40|$|Abstract- The {{deposition}} process of IV-VI semiconductors is studied {{in order to}} determine optimal conditions of evaporation. A thermodynamical model of the growth is proposed and its use explained in HWE applications. Using these results, epitaxial thin films have been achieved on BaF 2 and Si substrates in all the composition range from PbSe to PbTe. The epilayers obtained were then characterized by Xray diffraction, Auger spectroscopy, SEM observations and electrical measurements. An optical study from 4. 2 to 300 K is finally presented and the energy band gap dependence versus composition and temperature has been established. The evaporation of IV-VI compounds and particularly lead chalcogenides {{has been the subject of}} considerable attention [I, 2, 31 for many years because of their technological applications in the infrared field: laser emission and detection. It is very important to note that their narrow energy band gap can be easily <b>ajust</b> by the substitution of IV orland VI element in ternary or quaternary alloys [4]. In this paper, we present a general study of the substitution of selenium by tellurium in PbSe which have an important interest in the accordance between the Iattice constants of substrate and layer in the case of epitaxial elaborating methods.

40|$|The present {{thesis is}} not a mere {{overview}} of the existing legal literature bearing on choice of law rules for marriage, {{nor is it a}} simple survey of the whole range of arguments endorsing one approach over another with regard to this issue: it rather puts forward a sustained argument towards a more appropriate {{way of looking at the}} conflict of law problems in marriage. Though choice of law rules for marriage has long preoccupied scholars and judges alike, the ever increasing antagonism between the preponderance of conflict values [predictability, certainty] and the growing concern to guarantee <b>ajust</b> result in individual atypical cases makes the continuous exploration of this particular topic both necessary and of significant legal interest. The study seeks essentially to establish that, contrary to what most scholars would have us believe, the intractable conflict problems in marriage are not inherent in the inefficiency of the traditional general choice of law rules, nor simply in the interrelation between different social, religious and legal cultures. Rather,they are attributable to the structure of a seemingly modem methodology that focuses more and more on the the attainment of <b>ajust</b> substantive result, the astonishing lack of consensus among legal systems, the disregard of coordination of policy considerations relevant in marriage, the parochial and nationalistic focus in choice of law, as well as in the application of the rule that lex fori is the only source of conflict norms. Further, the inappropriate application of the general choice of law rules, and the lasting antinomy between the international objectives [the attribution of an international relationship to the relevant system] and the national sources of conflict of laws are at the heart of the choice of law problems in marriage. The emerging academic movement to modernise choice of law rules for marriage, with a view to guaranteeing desirable results in hard cases, defeats the very essence of conflict of laws, and renders illusory what little certainty and predictability the normative criteria of the com 1 icts orthodoxies may provide. The underlying reason lies in the inherent disregard of the practical difficulties facing the officials who have, outside the courts, to apply the law and to reconcile the competing goals of predictability and flexibility. The present writer's objective is the development of a more appropriate approach which can establish an equilibrium between the much needed certainty in the present subject and judicial appreciation of the difficulties presented in the individual atypical cases, without scuttling the established conflicts orthodoxies, and at the same time to eliminate the social evil termed "limping marriage". Finally, the domestic and intemationallaw reform agencies should avoid the parochial and nationalistic focus in choice of law, and the rule that lex fori is the only source of conflicts norms if they wish to make a claim that their aim is the attainment of a universal uniform body of rules which will ensure the universal validity of a marriage, and the maximum harmony of decisions...|$|E

The temperature profile (TP) of the intracluster medium (ICM) is of primeval importance for deriving the dynamical {{parameters of the}} largest equilibrium systems known in the universe, in particular their total mass profile. Analytical models of the ICM often assume that the ICM is isothermal or parametrize the TP with a polytropic index γp. This parameter is <b>ajusted</b> to observations, but has in fact poor physical meaning for values other than 1 or 5 / 3, when considering monoatomic gases. In this article, I present a theoretical model of a relaxed cluster where the TP is instead structured by electronic thermal conduction. Neglecting cooling and heating terms, the stationnary energy conservation equation reduces to a second order differential equation, whose resolution requires two boundary conditions, taken here as the inner radius and the ratio between inner and outer temperature.

40|$|Segmentation is an {{essential}} ingredient {{in a wide range}} of image processing tasks and a building block of many visualization environments. Many known segmentation techniques suffer from being computationally exhaustive and thus decreasing interactivity, especially when considering volume data sets. Multilevel methods have proved to be a powerful machinery to speed up applications which incorporate some hierarchical structure. So does segmentation when considered on quadtree respectively octree data sets. Here we present a new approach which combines a discrete and a continuous multilevel segmentation model. In figure 1 four different grid segments are depicted which resulted from the multilevel segmentation by using combinations of different boundary indicators which will be described later in detail. At first, the discrete method enables a fast segmentation depending on possibly multiple parameters describing the segment boundary and on selected seed points inside a segment. In an interactive process the user is able to <b>ajust</b> seed points which steer the automatic discrete segmentation process. Furthermore fast multilevel splatting techniques simultaneously enable interactive frame rates in the visualization to validate the obtained results. Thus, the user is effectively supported in the selection of appropriate parameters for the segmentation. Once an acceptable voxel discrete approximation is found a second segmentation and smoothing method based on a continuous model comes into play. It can be regarded Figure 1 : Segmentation Results by greyvalue and gradient magnitude thresholding and the exclusion indicator σ = −χGc to prevent the algorihm to grow into Lena’s hat.

40|$|The spatial {{characterization}} of soil attributes is fundamental for {{the understanding of}} forest ecosystems. The objective of this work {{was to develop a}} geostatistical study of chemical and physical soil attributes at three depths (D 1 – 0 - 20 cm; D 2 – 20 - 50 cm; D 3 – 50 - 100 cm), in an Experimental Hydrographic Micro-catchment entirely covered by Atlantic Forest, in the Mantiqueira Range region, Minas Gerais. All the considered variables presented spatial dependence structure in the three depths, and the largest degrees of spatial dependence were observed for pH in the three depths, soil cation exchange capacity potential in D 3, soil organic matter in D 1 and D 3 and clay and soil bulk density in D 2. The method most used for the adjustments of semi-variogram models was the Maximum Likelihood and the most selected model was the Exponential. Furthermore, the ordinary kriging maps allowed good visualization of the spatial distribution of the variables. Index terms: Brazilian native forest, geostatistics, soil features. RESUMO A caracterização espacial de atributos do solo é fundamental para o entendimento de ecossistemas florestais. Neste trabalho, objetivoi-se desenvolver um estudo geoestatístico de atributos químicos e físicos do solo em três profundidades (P 1 – 0 - 20 cm; P 2 – 20 - 50 cm; P 3 – 50 - 100 cm), em uma Microbacia Hidrográfica Experimental inteiramente coberta por Mata Atlântica, na região Serra da Mantiqueira, Minas Gerais. Todas as variáveis consideradas apresentaram estrutura de dependência espacial nas três profundidades, sendo que os maiores graus de dependência espacial foram observados para pH nas três profundidades, capacidade de troca de cátions potencial do solo em P 3, matéria orgânica do solo em P 1 e P 3 e argila e densidade do solo em P 2.

ABSTRACT Kinetics {{of fruit}} drop on Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck cv. Salustiana The kinetics and anatomy of abscission were studied {{during the initial}} development of fruits of sweet orange cv. Salustiana (Citrus sinensis (L). One hundred and fifty unifloral leafy shoots were labelled in 25 trees in an orchard located in Museros (Valencia, Spain) to follow the development from anthesis to 104 days after anthesis (daa), from March to July. The fruit diameter was measured and the histology was recorded in fresh made slides from a freezing microtome. The growth in diameter followed a sigmoidal curve with a close relation between the rate of fruit growth and its relative abscission. Three abscission zones were identified early in the fruitlets; one for the drop of the style/floral axis and two for the ovary/fruitlet which activated as progress the fruit development...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{is to improve the}} steady state {{stability}} of a pencil balanc-ing system. The first phase of this project involves modeling and implementing of an inverted pendulum system. Aim is to provide a stable control loop to keep a pen in unstable equilibrium, including human pen positioning at startup. Complete anal-ysis of mechanical system is provided through linearized model on operating point, using Matlab Simulink. Our control loop is closed through DVS cameras, providing angle (slope of the captured line) and base position of the moving object. Different types of controllers (from simple PID to self-adaptive controllers and Fuzzy) have been analyzed in detail. In order to reduce the extra motion of the cup and make the system more stable we implemented a low pass filter on the servomotors inputs. This filter can be manually in the configuration panel <b>ajusted.</b> Another point to be discussed is the startup conditions. The humain slow perception makes it hard to work with a system, which moves with a higher frequency than ours. By means of the implemented low pass filter during this project {{it is much easier to}} stablize the pencil. 3 Content...|$|R
40|$|In {{an earlier}} work we had {{considered}} a Gaussian ensemble of random matrices {{in the presence}} of a given external matrix source. The measure is no longer unitary invariant and the usual techniques based on orthogonal polynomials, or on the Coulomb gas representation, are not available. Nevertheless the n-point correlation functions are still given in terms of the determinant of a kernel, known through an explicit integral representation. This kernel is no longer symmetric though and is not readily accessible to standard methods. In particular finding the level spacing probability is always a delicate problem in Fredholm theory, and we have to reconsider the problem within our model. We find a new class of universality for the level spacing distribution when the spectrum of the source is <b>ajusted</b> to produce a vanishing gap in the density of the state. The problem is solved through coupled non-linear differential equations, which turn out to form a Hamiltonian system. As a result we find that the level spacing probability p(s) behaves like [- C s^ 83] for large spacing s; this is consistent with the asymptotic behavior [- C s^ 2 β + 2], whenever the density of state behaves near the edge as ρ(λ) ∼λ^β.

40|$|Understand {{the stages}} of current use and {{occupation}} of land {{on the banks of}} rivers is crucial for planning and managing these environments. Watersheds as the São Francisco river need, increasingly, studies that aim to contribute to the planning of the use of their land, as well as its key resource, water. In this context, this article aims to present the current situation of land use in the areas bordering the São Francisco River in the stretch that includes the cities of Petrolina and Juazeiro states of Pernambuco and Bahia respectively, taking into account the degree of protection these uses related to water body. From an orbital image obtained by the TM sensor coupled to the Landsat 5 was obtained the <b>Ajusted</b> Soil Vegetation Index (SAVI). The results point that the outcome of the SAVI, befits with the reality observed in the field and that the use of land for the crops that use irrigation, allied with areas with exposed soils put the banks of the São Francisco River with a low degree of laminar erosion protection and washout the banks. Given the current structure of the submitted land use in the margins of 1 km from the river São Francisco expose out how much has been dedicated to the protection and preservation of the water environment.
