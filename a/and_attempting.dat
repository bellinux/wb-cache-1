40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to see whether {{differences}} in suicidal ideation <b>and</b> <b>attempts</b> between men <b>and</b> women could be explained by gender differences in sense of control.

40|$|This study explores {{associations}} of IQ at age 14 with adult symptoms of suicidal thoughts <b>and</b> <b>attempts</b> at age 21. Analysis {{was based on}} the Mater University Study of Pregnancy and its outcomes, an Australian prospective birth cohort study started in Brisbane Australia in 1981. We assessed associations with suicide thoughts, plans, <b>and</b> <b>attempts.</b> We used two measures of IQ: the Raven 2 ̆ 7 s Standard Progressive Matrices and the Wide Range Achievement Test. In multivariable analyses, there was an inverse association between Raven 2 ̆ 7 s IQ and suicide thoughts, plans, <b>and</b> <b>attempts,</b> but no strong evidence of an association between the WRAT 3 and the three suicidal items. Specific aspects of intelligence may be associated with suicidal thoughts, plans, <b>and</b> <b>attempts...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{influence}} of involuntary job loss on suicide <b>and</b> <b>attempted</b> suicide in young adults. Method: A population-based case–control study of young adults (18 – 34 years) was conducted in New South Wales, Australia. Cases included both suicides (n= 84) <b>and</b> <b>attempts</b> (n= 101). A structured interview was conducted with next of kin (for suicide cases) and suicide attempters admitted to hospital. Controls selected {{from the general population}} were matched to cases by age and sex. Job dismissal or redundancy (involuntary job loss) in the 12 months before suicide or attempt was the main study variable of interest. Suicide <b>and</b> <b>attempts</b> were modelled separately and in combination as outcomes using conditional logistic regression modelling. The analysis was also adjusted for marital status, socio-economic status and diagnosis of an affective or anxiety disorder. Results: Following adjustment for other variables, involuntary job loss was associated with an odds ratio of 1. 82 for suicide <b>and</b> <b>attempted</b> suicide (combined) (95 % CI 0. 98 to 3. 37; p= 0. 058). Low socio-economic status was associated with an odds ratio of 3. 80 for suicide <b>and</b> <b>attempted</b> suicide (95 % CI 2. 16 to 6. 67; p< 0. 001) compared to high socio-economic status (after adjustment). Diagnosis of a mental disorder was associated with a 7. 87 (95 % CI 5. 16 to 12. 01; p< 0. 001) odds ratio of suicide <b>and</b> <b>attempted</b> suicide compared to no diagnosis (after adjustment). Involuntary job loss was associated with increased odds of suicide <b>and</b> <b>attempts</b> when these were modelled separately, but results did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: Involuntary job loss was associated with increased odds of suicide <b>and</b> <b>attempted</b> suicide. The strength of this relationship was attenuated after adjustment for socio-economic status and mental disorders, which indicates that these may have a stronger influence on suicide than job loss...|$|R
