5|$|Following the 1932–33 series, several authors, {{including}} {{many of the}} players involved, released books expressing various points of view about bodyline. Many {{argued that it was}} a scourge on cricket and must be stamped out, while some did not see what all the fuss was about. The series has been described as the most controversial period in Australian cricket history, and voted the most important Australian moment by a panel of Australian cricket identities. The MCC asked Harold Larwood to sign an apology to them for his bowling in Australia, making his selection for England again conditional upon it. Larwood was furious at the notion, pointing out that he had been following orders from his upper-class captain, and that was where any blame should lie. Larwood refused, never played for England again, and became vilified in his own country. Douglas Jardine always defended his tactics and in the book he wrote about the tour, In Quest of the Ashes, described allegations that the England bowlers directed their attack with the intention of causing physical harm <b>as</b> <b>stupid</b> and patently untruthful. The immediate effect of the law change which banned bodyline in 1935 was to make commentators and spectators sensitive to the use of short-pitched bowling; bouncers became exceedingly rare and bowlers who delivered them were practically ostracised. This attitude ended after the Second World War, and among the first teams to make extensive use of short-pitched bowling was the Australian team captained by Bradman between 1946 and 1948. Other teams soon followed.|$|E

500|$|The popular {{ideals of}} dinosaurs have many misconceptions, {{reinforced}} by films, books, comics, television shows, and even theme parks.

500|$|The Great Depression and World War II {{combined}} to sink {{the study of}} dinosaurs into a decades-long lull. Scientists considered dinosaurs a group of unrelated animals that left no descendants, and dinosaurs were presented <b>as</b> <b>stupid,</b> slow, stuck in swamps, and doomed to extinction. Scientific dinosaur artwork, primarily from Rudolph F. Zallinger and Zdeněk Burian, reflected and reinforced the conception of dinosaurs as slow and static (one artistic quirk that became commonplace in representations of Mesozoic landscapes, {{the presence of a}} volcano, was a hallmark of Zallinger's). From such ideas came the alternate use of [...] "dinosaur" [...] as something out of date.|$|E

Chris Mathews, in Modern Satanism: Anatomy of a Radical Subculture, describes The Satanic Bible as [...] "hastily prepared" [...] and cynical. Both Mathews and a 1971 article in Newsweek compare the ideologies presented in The Satanic Bible to Nazism: containing [...] "unremitting focus on social elitism, appeals to force, and scorn for egalitarian principles".

Mirkin had worked on {{the idea for the}} episode for a long time, basing the story on NASA's Teacher in Space Project to send ordinary civilians into space in order to spark interest amongst the general public. There was some controversy amongst the show's writing staff during production. Some of the writers felt that having Homer go into space was too large an idea. Matt Groening felt that the idea was so big that it gave the writers [...] "nowhere to go". Several silly gags were therefore toned down to make the episode feel more realistic, including an idea that everyone at NASA was <b>as</b> <b>stupid</b> as Homer. The writers focused more upon the relationship between Homer and his family and Homer's attempts to be a hero.|$|E

[...] Stylus Magazine was pleased with the use of overdubbing in the song's [...] "anthemic rock chorus", but referred to its lyrics <b>as</b> <b>stupid.</b> [...] Billboard referred to the group as the B-52's of the 2000s and praised [...] "Hella Good"'s combination of a strong bassline; [...] "fairly aggressive electric guitar accents"; Kraftwerk-style electronics; and Stefani's [...] "loose, playful" [...] vocals.

500|$|Rockwell's {{summer was}} full of distractions. At one point a Manhattan gastroenterologist {{prescribed}} a surgery of uncertain nature, {{though it was not}} performed. He had commissions for other magazines, and business complications regarding second reproduction rights. He also had his Boy Scout commitment. Under time constraints, Rockwell made every excuse to avoid all other distracting assignments. In October, The Post sent its art editor to Arlington to check on Rockwell's progress. At about the same time, despite its Graphics Division chief's, Francis Brennan's outrage, the OWI began showing signs of renewed interest. In fact, after Rockwell was chosen the entire OWI Writers' Division resigned. The press release associated with the resignation asserted that the OWI was dominated by [...] "high-pressure promoters who prefer slick salesmanship to honest information. These promoters would treat <b>as</b> <b>stupid</b> and reluctant customers {{the men and women of}} the United States." [...] There was further turmoil in the OWI from a faction supporting work by Ben Shahn; Shahn's work was not used in propaganda because it lacked general appeal. There were several artists who were commissioned to promote the war, including Jean Carlu, Gerard Hordyke, Hugo Ballin, and Walter Russell. Russell created a Four Freedoms Monument that was eventually dedicated at Madison Square Garden in New York City.|$|E

500|$|The season five episode [...] "Deep Space Homer", {{in which}} the {{characters}} Homer and Barney are recruited by NASA, is Mirkin's first writing credit on The Simpsons, the second being [...] "The Man Who Came to Be Dinner", which was co-written with Al Jean. Mirkin worked on the concept for a long time, basing the story on NASA's Teacher in Space Project scheme to send ordinary civilians into space in order to spark interest amongst the general public. The idea proved controversial {{to some of the}} show's writing staff, who felt that having Homer go into space was too [...] "large" [...] an idea. Series creator Matt Groening felt that the idea gave the writers [...] "nowhere to go". Based on these attitudes, several jokes were toned down to make the episode feel more realistic, including the impression that everyone at NASA was <b>as</b> <b>stupid</b> as Homer. During re-writes, Mirkin and the other writers placed greater emphasis on the relationship between Homer and his family and on Homer's attempts to be a hero, but most of Mirkin's original script was retained. The episode {{is considered one of the}} show's best. Colin Kennedy of Empire magazine named it a [...] "contender for greatest ever episode", and in Chris Turner's book, Planet Simpson, he says the episode is [...] "second to none". Regarding the long sequence that begins with Homer eating potato chips in the space shuttle and ends with Kent Brockman's dramatic speech, Turner claimed that it was [...] "simply among the finest comedic moments in the history of television". A copy of the episode was later sent to the International Space Station for astronauts to view. Mirkin considers the episode to be [...] "very very special". Ortved says the episode, in its plot and surreal humor, epitomizes Mirkin's era.|$|E
500|$|Dale Keown's {{comic book}} artwork of the Hulk was an {{inspiration}} for his design. Leterrier felt the first Hulk had [...] "too much fat [...] the proportions were a little off". He explained, [...] "The Hulk is beyond perfect so there is zero grams of fat, all chiseled, and his muscle and strength defines this creature so he's like a tank." [...] Visual effects supervisor Kurt Williams envisioned the Hulk's physique as a linebacker rather than a bodybuilder. A height of nine feet was chosen for the character as {{they did not want}} him to be too inhuman. To make him more expressive, computer programs controlling the inflation of his muscles and saturation of skin color were created. Williams cited flushing as an example of humans' skin color being influenced by their emotions. The animators felt green blood would make his skin become darker rather than lighter, and his skin tones, depending on lighting, either resemble an olive or even gray slate. His animation model was completed without the effects company's full knowledge of what he would be required to do: he was rigged to do whatever they imagined, in case the model was to be used for The Avengers film. The Hulk's medium-length hair was modeled on Mike Deodato's art. He originally had a crew cut, but Leterrier decided flopping hair imbued him with more character. Leterrier cited An American Werewolf in London as the inspiration for Banner's transformation, wanting to show how painful it was for him to change. As a nod to the live action TV series, Banner's eyes change color first when he transforms. Leterrier changed the Abomination's design from the comics because he felt the audience would question why he resembled a fish or a reptile, instead of [...] "an über-human" [...] like the Hulk. Rather, his hideousness is derived from being injected multiple times into his skin, muscles and bones; creating a creature with a protruding spine and sharp bones that he can use to stab. His green skin is pale, and reflects light, so it appears orange because of surrounding fire during the climactic battle. The motion capture performers, including Roth, tried to make the character behave less gracefully than the Hulk. They modeled his posture and the way he turns his head on a shark. The character also shares Roth's tattoos. A height of eleven feet was chosen for the character. Leterrier tried to work in the character's pointed ears, but realized the Hulk would bite them off (using the example of Mike Tyson when he fought Evander Holyfield), and felt ignoring that would make the Hulk come across <b>as</b> <b>stupid.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Donkeys hold a {{significant}} place in literature, especially in Western cultures. The original representations of donkeys in Western literature come {{mainly from the}} Bible and Ancient Greece. Donkeys were represented in a fairly negative form by the Greeks, but perceptions later changed, partially due to donkeys becoming increasingly symbolically connected to Christianity. Donkeys {{were found in the}} works of Homer, Aesop and Apuleius, where they were generally portrayed <b>as</b> <b>stupid</b> and stubborn, or servile at best, and generally represented the lower class. They were often contrasted with horses, which were seen as powerful and beautiful. Aesop's The Ass in the Lion's Skin, representational of the almost 20 of his fables that portray donkeys, shows the donkey as a fool. Apuleius's The Golden Ass (160 AD), where the narrator is turned into a donkey, is also notable for its portrayal of donkeys as stubborn, foolish, wicked and lowly. This work had a large influence on the portrayal of donkeys in later cultures, including medieval and renaissance Europe. During this time, donkeys continued to be shown <b>as</b> <b>stupid,</b> clumsy and slow. Shakespeare popularized {{the use of the word}} [...] "ass" [...] as an insult meaning stupid or clownish in many of his plays, including Bottom's appearance in A Midsummer Night's Dream (1600). In contrast, a few years later, Cervantes' Don Quixote shows a more positive slant on the donkey, primarily as Sancho Panza's mount, portraying them as steady and loyal companions. This difference is possibly due to donkeys being an important aspect of many Spaniards' lives at this point in time.|$|E
