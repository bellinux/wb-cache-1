5|$|After drying, the {{harvested}} stems or rhizomes were steamed for 24 {{hours or}} more in the umu tī pit. Steaming converted the carbohydrate fructan in the stems to very sweet fructose. The cooked stems or rhizomes were then ﬂattened by beating and carried back to villages for storage. Kāuru could be stored dry until {{the time came to}} <b>add</b> <b>it</b> to fern root and other foods to improve their palatability. The sugar in the stems or rhizomes would be partially crystallised, and could be found mixed in a sugary pulp with other matter between the fibres of the root, which were easily separated by tearing them apart. Kāuru could also be dipped in water and chewed, and was said to smell and taste like molasses.|$|E
5|$|Corder's {{skeleton}} was put {{on display}} in a glass case in the West Suffolk Hospital, and apparently was rigged with a mechanism that made its arm point to the collection box when approached. Eventually, the skull was removed by Dr John Kilner, who wanted to <b>add</b> <b>it</b> to his extensive collection of Red Barn memorabilia. After a series of unfortunate events, he became convinced that the skull was cursed and handed it on to a friend named Hopkins. Further disasters plagued both men, and they finally paid for the skull {{to be given a}} Christian burial in an attempt to lift the supposed curse.|$|E

5|$|I {{realize that}} many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written, {{sometimes}} in rhapsodical strains, about {{the duty of}} this Court to keep the Constitution {{in tune with the}} times. The idea is that the Constitution must be changed from time to time, and that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes. For myself, I must, with all deference, reject that philosophy. The Constitution makers knew the need for change, and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people's elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification. That method of change was good for our Fathers, and, being somewhat old-fashioned, I must <b>add</b> <b>it</b> is good enough for me.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} segment, Burns and Smithers {{go down to}} the lab during Homer's nightmare. The animators decided to make the {{animation}} a bit more impressive, and decided to do the concave and convex images of Burns and Smithers. Even though it was tough and took up more time, the producers felt that it was a necessary tour-de-force. Originally, Homer's robotic voice was done post-animation in order to avoid stress on the voice actor. One of the writers who created the Davy Crockett joke thought it was so funny that he actually mimicked the actions of Mr. Burns putting on Homer's brain in the writing room; the producers thought that it was hilarious, so they decided to <b>add</b> <b>it</b> into the episode.|$|E

However, the Up Next feature does not include features that used to be found in iTunes DJ, such as the ability for guests to request songs, does not provide as much information as the playlist view, and requires juggling multiple windows and floating dialogs to perform similar tasks.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin C (or ascorbic acid) {{is present}} in the grape and the must up to 50 milligrams per litre. It is a {{protection}} in the wort against the oxidation phenomenon. In the presence of oxygen it produces hydrogen peroxide; by this reaction it deprives the enzymes in the wort of oxygen that is necessary to oxidize the wine. Since 1962 the addition of vitamin C in the wine has been allowed to a maximum of 15 grams per hectolitre at the time of packaging to stabilize the wine. Experiments in the late 2000s tried to determine a method to <b>add</b> <b>it</b> to fresh harvests or in the wort.|$|E
25|$|Then {{comes the}} tens-column. The tens-column so far {{contains}} only one digit: the tens-digit of the multiplicand (though it might contain a carry digit under the line). Find {{the product of}} the multiplier and the tens-digits of the multiplicand. Then, if there is a carry digit (superscripted, under the line and in the tens-column), <b>add</b> <b>it</b> to this product. If the resulting sum is less than ten then write it in the tens-column under the line. If the sum has two digits then write its last digit in the tens-column under the line, and carry its first digit over to the next column: in this case the hundreds column.|$|E

25|$|Vitamin B1 or {{thiamine}} {{is present}} at a concentration between 0.2 and 0.5 milligrams per litre. This vitamin {{is necessary for}} the proper growth of yeasts that ensure alcoholic fermentation. In the must of healthy grapes the natural quantity is sufficient for the yeast. On the other hand, for a degraded harvest (by gray mold), the degradation of this vitamin leads the winemaker to <b>add</b> <b>it</b> to the must to ensure a trouble-free fermentation. In the case of a harvest with a very clear wort and low temperature the yeast works in a limited way and the addition of thiamine can help avoid a difficult end of fermentation. Legislation limits the amount added to 30 milligrams per hectolitre.|$|E
25|$|Tik-Tok informs Dorothy and Billina {{that they}} are in the Land of Ev, which has {{recently}} lost its royal family due to the King of Ev selling them to the Nome King, who rules in a neighboring underground kingdom. Afterwards, the King regretted what he had done and in despair jumped off a cliff into the sea and was drowned. Tik-Tok protects Dorothy and Billina from the Wheelers and takes them to the royal residence where Princess Langwidere resides. Langwidere is the spoiled and highly vain niece of the deceased king of Ev, and she has many exchangeable, detachable heads. When Dorothy refuses to let Langwidere take her head and <b>add</b> <b>it</b> to her collection, Langwidere has a tantrum and locks Dorothy in a high tower within the palace.|$|E
25|$|Then {{comes the}} tens-column. The tens-column might contain two digits: the tens-digit {{of the first}} number and the tens-digit of the second number. If one of the numbers has a missing tens-digit then the tens-digit for this number can be {{considered}} to be a 0. Add the tens-digits of the two numbers. Then, if there is a carry digit, <b>add</b> <b>it</b> to this sum. If the sum was 18 then adding the carry digit to it will yield 19. If the sum of the tens-digits (plus carry digit, if there is one) is less than ten then write it in the tens-column under the line. If the sum has two digits then write its last digit in the tens-column under the line, and carry its first digit (which should be a 1) over to the next column: in this case the hundreds-column.|$|E

25|$|Platinum {{was first}} used for minting coins in Spanish-colonized America. Following the {{discovery}} of platinum in gold rocks, the Spaniards were unable {{to use it for}} a long time because they had no technology for processing this metal. The then-cheap platinum was used for various kinds of frauds, such as substituting it for the more expensive silver. After the discovery that platinum alloys with gold, counterfeiters began to <b>add</b> <b>it</b> to gold coins. The platinum confiscated from counterfeiters was then thrown into the sea, in accordance with the royal decree of 1735. Later, the practice of adding platinum to gold as a ligature was adopted by the authorities in Spain in order to lower the gold content of coins. Also in Spain, in the mid-19th century, counterfeiters began producing British Sovereigns out of a gold-plated alloy of platinum and copper, relying on a similar specific weight of platinum and gold.|$|E

In order to win her love he tried to become a glorious warrior, but when she rejected him, spent years learning the magical arts instead. He finally cast a spell to win Naina's love, only to find that she herself was actually an old crone. After he rejected her, she became bent on revenge. Now that Finn had helped Ruslan, Naina will hate him as well.|$|E
25|$|For example, in most {{motion control}} systems, {{in order to}} {{accelerate}} a mechanical load under control, more force is required from the actuator. If a velocity loop PID controller {{is being used to}} control the speed of the load and command the force being applied by the actuator, then it is beneficial to take the desired instantaneous acceleration, scale that value appropriately and <b>add</b> <b>it</b> to the output of the PID velocity loop controller. This means that whenever the load is being accelerated or decelerated, a proportional amount of force is commanded from the actuator regardless of the feedback value. The PID loop in this situation uses the feedback information to change the combined output to reduce the remaining difference between the process setpoint and the feedback value. Working together, the combined open-loop feed-forward controller and closed-loop PID controller can provide a more responsive control system.|$|E
