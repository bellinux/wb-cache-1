50|$|The {{generally}} accepted reaction mechanism initially utilizes two successive stages of transmetallation of the committed Grignard reagent, {{leading to an}} intermediate dialkyldiisopropyloxytitanium complex. This complex undergoes a dismutation to give an alkane molecule and a titanacyclopropane 1. The insertion of the carbonyl group of the ester in the weakest carbon-titanium bond leads to an oxatitanacyclopentane 2 being rearranged to ketone 3. Lastly, the insertion of the carbonyl group of 3 in the residual carbon-titanium connection forms a cyclopropane ring. In the transition state of this elementary stage, which is the limiting stage of the reaction, an agostic interaction stabilizing between the beta hydrogen and the R2 group and the titanium atom was called upon to explain the diastereoselectivity observed.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in the technique of preparing oxide glasses from metal alcoholates through hydrolysis and gelling processes have been reviewed. Metal alcoholates undergo hydrolysis to form clear gels, which are converted to the corresponding oxide glasses on heating at considerably low temperatures compared to those required for {{the preparation of the}} equivalent glasses by the conventional melting technique. On the basis of the present technique, (1) the glasses with very high purity can be obtained, and (2) the glasses which are difficult to obtain by the conventional melting techniques because of extremely high melting temperature or high tendency toward crystallization and/or phase separation during cooling can be easily obtained. The glasses with attractive properties, e. g. low thermal expansion glasses of the TiO 2 -SiO 2 system, high alkali-resistance glasses of the ZrO 2 -SiO 2 system, high melting glasses of the Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 system and many other useful single or complex oxide glasses have been prepared from the corresponding metal alcoholates. Approprite control of the hydrolysis condition led us to the <b>alcoholate</b> solution sitable for making either glass films, glass fibers or monolithic glasses : (1) Slow hydrolysis based on the exposure of the <b>alcoholate</b> solution to atmosphere, or addition of the insufficient water and catalyst led to the solution of linearly polymerized alcoholates suitable for fiber drawing. (2) The careful addition of relatively large amounts of water and catalyst changed the <b>alcoholate</b> solution on the three-dimensional polymer gels suitable for preparing monolithic glasses. It has been revealed that the glasses derived from metal alcoholates often contain a relatively large amount of water. The removal of the water out of the glasses remains to be accomplished, since the incorporated water would decrease their mechanical strength and increase the tendency toward crystallization. It is hoped that further detailed informations on the polymerization process of metal alcoholates will provide us with castable gels which might form the glasses having any desired shapes.

Furthermore inhibiting or promoting action of some reagents for the above reaction was reported as an attempt to checking the solvent effect of these reagents on the reaction catalyzed by aluminum chloride. In the present work, the similar studies for the solvent effect of some reagents on the reactions shown as the heading carried out. The results obtained is as follows: (i) To the two kinds of reactions of the p-oxybenzylbromid-nitrobenzene-Al system and the p-oxybenzylbromid-Fe system, most of amines, mercaptans, Al <b>alcoholates</b> and liguroin showed promoting action, whereas most of alcohols and phenols showed inhibiting action. To the reaction of the p-nitrobenzylbromide-Fe system, these reagents showed, generally, inhibiting action but some sorts of amines and mercaptans showed promoting action. (ii) There is optimum quantity in amines, mercaptans, phenols, Al <b>alcoholates,</b> liguroin and nitrobenzene, respectively, required to minimize to their retardation. The effect of this quantity in phenols on the p-nitrobenzylbromide-Fe system reaction were evident especially. (iii) From the checking of the results relating the aspect of the additive influence for these reactions. It is presumed that the influence was mainly due to nitrobenzene as an additive and in some case ascribed to the nitrogroup existence in reactants. Therefore, our suggestion for the presence of suitable range of electric conductivity over which the intermediate complex in the system of catalytic reaction with metallic halide is activated by the ionization or polarization of that to desirable degree were reinforced. 著者らはハロゲン化炭化水素と金属類との反応性の研究に関し，ハロゲン化ベンジルと各種の金属との反応より，その進行の第 1 段階がハロゲン化金属の生成であり，第 2 段階がそれを触媒とする脱ハロゲン化縮合反応であること，および第 1 段の反応が金属の電溶圧と密接な関連のあることを見出してきている。さらにこれらの反応系に種々の添加物を添加した際の反応の阻害あるいは促進の様相を調べて塩化アルミニウム系触媒反応に対する広い意味での溶媒効果についても検討をおこなってきている。本報ではパラ位置に水酸基またはニトロ基を導入した臭化ベンジル化合物を使用して類縁の研究をおこなったものである...|$|R
