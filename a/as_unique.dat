5|$|In retrospect, Newcomer commended Williams' {{management}} {{for taking a}} risk on him and the game. The game has garnered praise from industry professionals as well. Jeff Peters of GearWorks Games lauded the gameplay, describing it <b>as</b> <b>unique</b> and intuitive. Fusion Learning Systems' Jeff Johannigman praised the flapping mechanism and Kim Pallister of Microsoft enjoyed the multi-player aspect.|$|E
5|$|Schubert's last sonatas are {{sometimes}} compared to Mozart's last symphonies, <b>as</b> <b>unique</b> compositional achievements: both consist of trilogies with one tragic, minor-key work, and two major-key works; both were created during an astoundingly {{short period of}} time; and both creating a culmination of the composer's lifetime achievement in their respective genres.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{emergence}} of these first multicellular organisms, a remarkable amount of biological diversity appeared over approximately 10 million years, in an event called the Cambrian explosion. Here, the majority of types of modern animals appeared in the fossil record, as well <b>as</b> <b>unique</b> lineages that subsequently became extinct. Various triggers for the Cambrian explosion have been proposed, including the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere from photosynthesis.|$|E

5|$|A {{central theme}} {{throughout}} Symeon's teachings and writings {{is that all}} Christians should aspire to have actual direct experience of God in deep contemplation, or theoria. Regarding his own mystical experiences, he presented them not <b>as</b> <b>unique</b> to himself, but as the norm for all Christians. He taught that the experience came after purification through prayer, repentance, and asceticism. He especially called on his monks {{to take on the}} traditional charismatic and prophetic role in the Church.|$|E
5|$|A {{research}} team undertook {{a study in}} 2016 to understand the appeal behind Mercury's voice. Led by Professor Christian Herbst, the team identified his notably faster vibrato and use of subharmonics <b>as</b> <b>unique</b> characteristics of Mercury's voice, particularly in comparison to opera singers, and confirmed a vocal range from F#2 to G5 (just over 3 octaves) but were unable to confirm claims of a 4-octave range. The {{research team}} studied vocal samples from 23 commercially available Queen recordings, his solo work, {{and a series of}} interviews of the late artist. They also used an endoscopic video camera to study a rock singer brought in to imitate Mercury's singing voice.|$|E
5|$|The cuisine of Switzerland is multifaceted. While some {{dishes such as}} fondue, raclette or rösti are omnipresent {{through the}} country, each region {{developed}} its own gastronomy according to the differences of climate and languages. Traditional Swiss cuisine uses ingredients {{similar to those in}} other European countries, as well <b>as</b> <b>unique</b> dairy products and cheeses such as Gruyère or Emmental, produced in the valleys of Gruyères and Emmental. The number of fine-dining establishments is high, particularly in western Switzerland.|$|E

5|$|Throughout his life, but {{especially}} during the 1770s, Bellman also wrote religious poetry, seeing no conflict with his bacchanalian works; he published collections of his religious poems in 1781 and 1787. He wrote some ten plays (none with particularly strong plots) as divertimentos, some of them later serving as entertainments at the royal court. The plays fill Volume 6 of his collected works. In 1783, Bellman brought out The Temple of Bacchus (Bacchi Tempel), perhaps hoping to establish {{his reputation as a}} poet, rather than the merry entertainer that he was in fact known as at the time; but he always stood out in people's minds <b>as</b> <b>unique,</b> a different kind of writer and performer.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Trenyce played Portia in David E. Talbert's play Love in the Nick of Tyme. It toured in North America to {{seventeen}} cities, {{starting in}} the Beacon Theatre in New York in January. In 2010, a film of the play was released on DVD, and its soundtrack was released separately. The film was also broadcast on Black Entertainment Television (BET). Trenyce performed at the Razz Room in San Francisco from July 22 to August 2, 2008. The same year, she made her film debut <b>as</b> <b>Unique</b> in the LGBT independent romantic comedy movie Friends & Lovers: The Ski Trip 2. A year later, she contributed the title track to the soundtrack for the film Truth Hall. Trenyce {{played a role in}} the 30th anniversary revival tour of the musical Ain't Misbehavin' after a recommendation from Ruben Studdard. As traditionally done with the show, the performers used their own names for their characters. The cast album received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, the Euclidean {{algorithm}} led to {{the development}} of new number systems, such as Gaussian integers and Eisenstein integers. In 1815, Carl Gauss used the Euclidean algorithm to demonstrate unique factorization of Gaussian integers, although his work was first published in 1832. Gauss mentioned the algorithm in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (published 1801), but only as a method for continued fractions. Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet seems to have been the first to describe the Euclidean algorithm as the basis for much of number theory. Lejeune Dirichlet noted that many results of number theory, such <b>as</b> <b>unique</b> factorization, would hold true for any other system of numbers to which the Euclidean algorithm could be applied. Lejeune Dirichlet's lectures on number theory were edited and extended by Richard Dedekind, who used Euclid's algorithm to study algebraic integers, a new general type of number. For example, Dedekind was the first to prove Fermat's two-square theorem using the unique factorization of Gaussian integers. Dedekind also defined the concept of a Euclidean domain, a number system in which a generalized version of the Euclidean algorithm can be defined (as described below). In the closing decades of the 19th century, the Euclidean algorithm gradually became eclipsed by Dedekind's more general theory of ideals.|$|E

5|$|Pinker's 1994 The Language Instinct was {{the first}} of several books to combine {{cognitive}} science with behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology. It introduces the science of language and popularizes Noam Chomsky's theory that language is an innate faculty of mind, with the controversial twist that the faculty for language evolved by natural selection as an adaptation for communication. Pinker criticizes several widely held ideas about language – that it needs to be taught, that people's grammar is poor and getting worse with new ways of speaking, the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis that language limits the kinds of thoughts a person can have, and that other great apes can learn languages. Pinker sees language <b>as</b> <b>unique</b> to humans, evolved to solve the specific problem of communication among social hunter-gatherers. He argues that it is as much an instinct as specialized adaptative behavior in other species, such as a spider's web-weaving or a beaver's dam-building.|$|E
5|$|Season 5, unlike {{previous}} seasons, {{continues the}} school year begun in the previous season. The season shows the reigning champion glee club finishing second at Nationals competition (episode 11) before the club is permanently disbanded by Sue Sylvester, now school principal, for budgetary reasons (episode 12), leaving the focus on graduation. The show then jumps several months forward in time and deals entirely with the alumni's lives in New York City {{for the remainder of}} the season, including Rachel's successful Broadway debut. Throughout this season, the club and its alumni deal with relationships; death and mourning; body image, gay bashing, intimacy, and other social issues. Several main cast members dropped to recurring guest stars as of this season: Amber Riley as Mercedes, Mark Salling as Puck, Harry Shum Jr. as Mike and Heather Morris as Brittany. New main cast members included glee club members introduced in the fourth season: Melissa Benoist as Marley Rose, Alex Newell <b>as</b> <b>Unique</b> Adams, Blake Jenner as Ryder Lynn, Jacob Artist as Jake Puckerman, and Becca Tobin as Kitty Wilde. Actor Cory Monteith died during summer before the fifth season was shot; his character, Finn Hudson, died in the season's third episode, The Quarterback.|$|E
5|$|The {{secretions}} {{from the}} parasite give the Nemesis massively heightened regenerative abilities, which {{result in the}} creature being almost impervious to damage; although it can be put down with enough fire from small arms, eventually it will repair itself and resume the pursuit of its targets. However, this resulted in unexpected side effects, including damage to the skin {{and the emergence of}} additional tentacles, as well as unpredictable mutations caused by further attacks. In Resident Evil 3, the creature's survival instincts eventually override Nemesis' programming, causing the host's body to reject the parasite and transform into a giant digestive organ. Featuring large central bone protrusions and elongated tentacles, it crawls looking for prey, yet continues trying to complete its mission despite its now diminished intelligence. This design proved to be the most difficult for the game's development team, as they worked {{to try to make it}} appear <b>as</b> <b>unique</b> as possible.|$|E
