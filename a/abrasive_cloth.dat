The microsample laid on a glass slide was embedded in a drop of acrylic resin, Technovit® 2000 LC, and polymerized with blue light for 3  min. After cured, the sample was fixed with Technovit® 2000 LC fixing paste within a Teflon mounting mould with the stratigraphy facing upwards. The mould was filled with more acrylic resin which cured for 15  min. Finally, the cross-section was revealed by dry polishing with micromesh® <b>abrasive</b> <b>cloths</b> (granulometry 600 and 8000). This method enabled the multi-layer analysis of the microsample. The composition of the micromesh® 8000 grit (aluminium oxide) was taken into account when interpreting the analytical results.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} tempering temperatures (300 - 600 degrees C) on abrasive wear resistance of {{mottled cast iron}} were studied. Abrasive wear tests were carried out using the rubber-wheel test on quartz sand and the pin test on Al(2) O(3) <b>abrasive</b> <b>cloths.</b> The retained austenite content of the matrix was determined by X-ray diffraction. The wear surface of the specimens was examined by scanning electron microscopy for identifying the wear micromechanism. Bulk hardness and matrix hardness {{before and after the}} tests were measured. The results showed that in the two-body (pin-on-disc test) system, the main wear mechanism was microcutting and high matrix hardening was presented. The wear rates presented higher correlation with the retained austenite than with the bulk and matrix hardness. In the three-body system (sand-rubber wheel), the wear surfaces presented indentations due to abrasive rolling. The wear rates had better correlation with both the bulk and matrix hardness (before and after the wear test) than with the retained austenite content. There are two groups of results, high and low wear rates corresponding to each tribosystem, two-body abrasive wear and three-body abrasive wear, respectively. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Plastics are {{macromolecular}} materials without {{we cannot}} imagine any branch {{of human activity}} with. Plastics have unique properties, often very different from metals. At {{the choice of the}} concrete plastic for the concrete application it is necessary to evaluate its mechanical, physical, chemical and technological properties. In last years producers offer also plastics for production of parts exposed to different types of wear. In the contribution the results of wear resistance studying of 10 types of plastics (PTFE, PVC, POM-C, PC, PETP, PEEK, PA 66, PP, PA 6 E and PE-UHMW) of one producer are published and compared with test results of four different Fe alloys (grey iron, structural steel, cast steel wear resistant and high-speed steel). The laboratory tests were carried out using the pin-on-disk machine with <b>abrasive</b> <b>cloth</b> (according to ČSN 01   5084), when the abrasive clothes of three different grits (240, 120 and 60) were used. It corresponds to the average abrasive grain sizes of 44. 5 µm, 115. 5 µm and 275 µm. During the test the test sample was pressed to the <b>abrasive</b> <b>cloth</b> by the pressure of 0. 1 MPa.

40|$|Tooth {{cleaning}} and household cleaning are common tasks people undertake {{on a daily}} basis and they share significant analogies. Both rely on the combined action of a detergent - usually a fluid which may contain abrasive particles - and an applicator on a cleaning surface. While scientific information covers some of the aspects related to abrasive tooth cleaning, such as the main tooth wear mechanisms and the influence of dental care products on tooth {{cleaning and}} wear, household cleaning has not been covered in such detail. The aim of this work was to investigate abrasive tooth cleaning and abrasive household cleaning from a tribological perspective in terms of the interactions between human/applicator, applicator/abrasive particles and abrasive particles/substrate, in order to expand the knowledge on both subjects and gather information useful to improve the design of current cleaning products. A study has been carried out by means of a hand operated friction rig to measure the loads applied by human subjects while performing simulated abrasive cleaning operations in order to better understand the interaction between human test subject and applicator. The analysis investigated the loads applied during tooth cleaning processes and household cleaning processes, and the results (from 180 g to 4230 g for tooth cleaning tests and from 290 g to 4. 3 Skg for household cleaning tests) helped Unilever in developing their friction analysis techniques. Particle entrainment into the contact area between the applicator and the surface has been analysed using two types of test rig- one with a unidirectional motion and the other a reciprocating motion - and an optical apparatus featuring a microscope and a camera for image and video capturing. The scratches produced by abrasive particles were studied with an optical microscope and a Scanning Electron Microscope in order to understand how they scratch the surface during abrasive cleaning processes. The investigation helped to gather information on how abrasive particles were trapped {{at the tip of the}} toothbrush filaments and between the cloth fibres and the observation of the scratched surfaces led to identify grooving abrasion as the main wear mechanism taking place in both abrasive tooth cleaning and household cleaning. A friction analysis of both tooth cleaning and household cleaning processes was carried out using the hand operated rig and a friction rig on which the applicators were mounted, to study the connection between the friction coefficient) l and the ability of the particles to remove material from the test surface. It was found that under the adopted experimental conditions, the lubricating action exerted by the carrying fluids in both tooth cleaning and household cleaning is mainly based on boundary lubrication. The values of the friction coefficient determined from the experiments ranged from around 0. 20 (in wet condition, without abrasive particles) to 0. 37 (in dry condition, without abrasive particles) for brushing tests, and from around 0. 20 (in lubricated condition, with 5 urn Calcium Carbonate particles) to 0. 66 (in dry condition, without <b>abrasive</b> particles) for <b>cloth</b> tests. The influence of the applied load, the particle size and concentration on friction coefficient was also investigated. Finally, a semi-empirical model was developed to estimate the rate of material removal during a simulated household cleaning process, in order to gather information useful to improve the ability of cleaning fluids to remove stain while reducing the damage to the cleaning surfaces. Results from the modelling were compared with data from reciprocating cleaning tests. Although the model often overestimated the amount of material removed from the test surface due to the assumptions made in order to simplify its implementation, it produced results of the same magnitude order of those obtained from material removal experiments within the ranges of applied loads, particle sizes and concentrations. lJEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the process of wear and {{abrasive}} materials which are able to withstand wear and to prove these findings in experiments in both laboratory and operational conditions. The first section includes an analysis of a material of the worn parts of dies (mould tools) for the manufacture of technical ceramics and solutions to increase their lifespan. A more resistant ledeburitic tool steel for the manufacture of dies (mould tools) 19 573 (according to ČSN) was chosen. The second section comprises laboratory tests with chosen PVD coatings applied on selected steel. The most resistant nitride coating was chosen after laboratory tests done in an abrasive vessel and with an <b>abrasive</b> <b>cloth.</b> The third section describes the operational test of the dies (mould tools) with functional component parts on which there was applied a chosen coating. The last section of the work proves the possibility of a usage of tool steels for the manufacture of abrasively stressed components of a plough. Unalloyed structural steel samples with a different heat treatment and the abrasion-resistant material Hardox were tested together with the samples of tool steels. The wear resistance of these steels was also proven by the laboratory tests with the <b>abrasive</b> <b>cloth</b> and the Bond`s device.

40|$|Bonded joint {{is a very}} {{exacting}} system. Its {{quality and}} failure rate depends on many factors. Basic failures of bonded joints divide in adhesive and cohesive ones. When the breakaway between adhesive lay and bonded material occurs, it is adhesive failure. The presence of oxides and of not quite suitable wetted surface geometry is the reason. By a suitable mechanical pretreatment of a bonded surface the adhesive failure can be hindered. For tests two groups of materials were chosen, namely steel and aluminum alloys. The aim of tests was the evaluation of roughness parameters change of steel, aluminum and duralumin surfaces using different grit of the <b>abrasive</b> <b>cloth.</b> Thanks to different material structure {{it was possible to}} determine the different effect of the same abrasives on the integrity of the grinded surface. Comparing the reached strength values the hypothesis was confirmed that the bonded surface mechanical pretreatment is one of key influences on the bonded joint primary strength. The analysis of reached data makes possible the formulation of optimum roughness parameters values with contemporary defining the <b>abrasive</b> <b>cloth</b> type. Lepený spoj je velmi náročný systém a jeho kvalita či poruchovost závisí na mnoha faktorech. Základní poruchy lepených spojů se dělí na adhezní a kohezní.

40|$|Any {{machine part}} {{is subject to}} {{degradation}} processes. Intensive wear occurs either when two bearing surfaces come into contact or when loose particles rub the function surface of a machine part. Soil processing machines are a good example. A similar process of abrasive wear occurs also in mixing machines or lines for material transport, such as worm-conveyors. The experiment part of this paper analyses hard metal weld deposit dedicated for renovation of abrasive stressed surfaces. In order to prolong the service life of a blade disc in a mixing machine Kreis-Biogas-Dissolver, the technology of hard surfacing by an electric arc was used. Tested hard metal electrodes were applied on a steel tape class 11 373. To eliminate mixing with the base material, weld beads were applied in two layers. Firstly, the weld bead was visually analyzed on a binocular microscope. Further, weld bead {{as well as the}} base material was analyzed from the metallographic point of view, whose aim was to identify the structure of weld metal and the origin of microcracks in weld bead. Moreover, there was also measured microhardness of weld metal. Abrasive resistance was tested according to the norm ČSN 01 5084, which is an <b>abrasive</b> <b>cloth</b> test. As in the mixing process also erosion wear occurs, there was also processed a test on a Bond device simulating stress of test samples by loose abrasive particles.
