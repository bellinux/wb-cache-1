40|$|Sex <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> {{may have}} {{behavioral}} and psychological relationships and have cortical regions in common. This research investigated the general relationship between sex <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> from a reward perspective {{among the general}} population. Two-hundred and sixty-one Chinese participants were recruited via the internet (136 males, 125 females, mean age 30. 46 years) to fill in questionnaires about wanting and liking for sex <b>and</b> <b>eating.</b> The results revealed that first, there was {{a positive correlation between}} wanting for sex <b>and</b> wanting to <b>eat</b> only for males. Second, the relationship between liking for sex <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> was also positive for males and not significant in females. Third, the correlation between sociosexual orientation <b>and</b> wanting to <b>eat</b> was significant only in females, and there was no significant correlation between sociosexual orientation <b>and</b> liking for <b>eating.</b> Fourth, emotional sex cravings (or emotional sexual activity) was positively correlated with emotional food cravings (or emotional eating behavior), with a higher magnitude correlation in males than females. Finally, analysis of wanting (liking) models of sex <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> for males <b>and</b> females revealed three models for wanting among females: high wanting, low wanting for <b>eating,</b> <b>and</b> low wanting for sex; and two models for wanting among males: high wanting and low wanting. Liking for sex <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> among females consisted of two types of model: high liking and low liking; whereas three type models existed for males: high liking for sex, high liking for <b>eating,</b> <b>and</b> low liking. In general, our research revealed that, as with other natural rewards, sex <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> have considerable commonality and are related in numerous ways...|$|R

5|$|Females of P. labiata and P. schultzi {{try to kill}} <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> {{their mates}} during or after copulation, by {{twisting}} and lunging. The males wait until the females have hunched their legs, making this attack less likely. Males also try to abseil from a silk thread to approach from above, but females may manoeuvre to get the higher position. If the female moves at all, the male leaps and runs away.|$|E
5|$|Most microbats, {{especially}} in temperate areas, prey on insects. The diet of an insectivorous bat may span {{a wide range}} of species, including flies, beetles, moths, grasshoppers, crickets, termites, bees, wasps, mayflies and caddisflies. Large numbers of Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) fly hundreds of meters above the ground in central Texas to feed on migrating moths. Species that hunt insects in flight, like the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), may catch an insect in mid-air with its mouth, <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> it in the air or use their tail membranes or wings to scoop up the insect and carry it to the mouth. The bat may also take the insect back to its roost <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> it there. Slower moving bat species such as the brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus) and many horseshoe bat species, may take or glean insects from vegatation or hunt them from perches. Insectivorous bats living at high latitudes have to consume prey with higher energetic value than tropical bats.|$|E
40|$|Body image <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> {{disorders}} {{have emerged}} as an essential facet of bio-psychosocial well-being. Although considered less prevalent in Ghana than in the West, body image <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders are issues of global concern. One hundred (100) female participants {{with a mean age}} of approximately 21 years were recruited after informed consent for this pilot study. Results showed a positive correlation between body image <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders. In addition, there was no significant difference between the levels of university education on female body image <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> distortions in Ghana. These findings underscore the importance for more future studies in nutritional psychology and related clinical management...|$|R

40|$|Symptoms {{of muscle}} dysmorphia, body dysmorphic disorder, <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> {{disorders}} in a nonclinical population of adult male weightlifters in Australia. J Strength Cond Res 29 (5) : 1406 – 1414, 2015 —The current study aimed to (a) determine {{the rates of}} symptoms of muscle dysmorphia (MD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorder; (b) determine the relationships among symptoms of MD, BDD, <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders; <b>and</b> (c) provide a comprehensive comparison of symptoms of MD, BDD, <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders in a nonclinical population of adult male weightlifters in Australia. The participants (N = 648, mean age = 29. 5 years, SD = 10. 1) participated in an online survey, consisting of Muscle Appearance Satisfaction Scale, the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Questionnaire, and the Eating Attitude Test- 26. Results indicated that 110 participants (17 %) were {{at risk of having}} MD, 69 participants (10. 6 %) were at risk of having BDD, and 219 participants (33. 8 %) were at risk of having an eating disorder. Furthermore, 36 participants (5. 6 %) were found at risk of having both MD and BDD, and 60 participants (9. 3 %) were at risk of having both MD <b>and</b> an <b>eating</b> disorder. Significant correlations and associations were found between symptoms of MD and BDD, and symptoms of MD <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders. Support was provided for the comorbidity of, and symptomatic similarities between, symptoms of MD and BDD, and symptoms of MD <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders. This may reflect a shared pathogenesis between symptoms of MD, BDD, <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders. Strength <b>and</b> conditioning professionals, exercise scientists, athletic trainers, and personal trainers should be aware that adult males who are working out with weights (i. e., free weights or machines) may be at increased risk of having MD, BDD, <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorders...|$|R
5|$|A {{parasitic}} fly, Lucilia bufonivora, attacks adult common toads. It lays its eggs on the toad's {{skin and}} when these hatch, the larvae crawl into the toad's nostrils <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> its flesh internally with lethal consequences. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum) {{is unusual in}} that it can climb up water plants and move around on its muscular foot. It sometimes clings to the toe of a common toad and this {{is believed to be}} one of the means by which it disperses to new locations.|$|E
5|$|Bog turtles are {{omnivorous}} <b>and</b> <b>eat</b> {{aquatic plants}} (such as duckweed), seeds, berries, earthworms, snails, slugs, insects, other invertebrates, frogs, {{and other small}} vertebrates. They also occasionally eat carrion. Invertebrates such as insects are generally the most important food item. In captivity, a bog turtle can be fed a variety of fruits and vegetables, as well as meat such as liver, chicken hearts, and tinned dog food. Bog turtles feed only during the day, but rarely during the hottest hours, consuming their food on land or in the water.|$|E
