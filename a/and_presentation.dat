5|$|Although the 77,777 {{copies of}} Advent Pieces: Limited that were {{released}} in Japan sold out {{months in advance}} of the official release date, Last Order received a negative fan response due to changes in content <b>and</b> <b>presentation</b> from the original Final Fantasy VII game, and because of this, the crew working on Crisis Core avoided recreating certain scenes from Last Order.|$|E

Critics praised the graphics <b>and</b> <b>presentation,</b> although some criticised the repetitiveness and hard difficulty.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} directly after Nightshade, and re-uses the latter game's Filmation II game engine that allows images to be rendered without overlapping each other. The game received mostly positive reviews upon release; praise {{was directed at}} the graphics <b>and</b> <b>presentation,</b> but criticism was directed at the game's similarity to Nightshade. It was later included in Rare Replay, Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation.|$|E

5|$|Above the {{transport}} layer, {{there are certain}} protocols that are sometimes used and loosely fit in the session <b>and</b> <b>presentation</b> layers, most notably the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols.

Finally, at the application layer, are many of the protocols Internet users would be familiar with such as HTTP (web browsing), POP3 (e-mail), FTP (file transfer), IRC (Internet chat), BitTorrent (file sharing) and XMPP (instant messaging).|$|E
5|$|Admittedly, Diocletian's praetorian prefects—Afranius Hannibalianus, Julius Asclepiodotus, and Aurelius Hermogenianus—aided in {{regulating}} the flow <b>and</b> <b>presentation</b> of such paperwork, but the deep legalism of Roman culture kept the workload heavy. Emperors in the forty years preceding Diocletian's reign had not managed these duties so effectively, and their output in attested rescripts is low. Diocletian, by contrast, was prodigious in his affairs: there are around 1,200 rescripts {{in his name}} still surviving, and these probably represent {{only a small portion}} of the total issue. The sharp increase in the number of edicts and rescripts produced under Diocletian's rule has been read as evidence of an ongoing effort to realign the whole Empire on terms dictated by the imperial center.|$|E

5|$|Haunting Ground {{was first}} {{revealed}} in September 2004, {{and was released}} next April garnering mixed to average reviews. The graphics <b>and</b> <b>presentation</b> were praised, but critics found the gameplay somewhat repetitive, predictable, and derivative of previous horror titles. The sexual objectification of Fiona was highlighted by some critics {{as one of the}} game's best elements. They found that by illustrating her as an object of desire, the game makes Fiona and therefore the player feel more fragile and endangered, building a more disturbing atmosphere. The fluctuating degree of player control over Fiona has made Haunting Ground a key subject in the study of avatars and their relationship with players in video games.|$|E
5|$|Interspersed {{throughout}} his scientific essays for Natural History magazine, Gould frequently {{referred to his}} nonscientific interests and pastimes. As a boy he collected baseball cards and remained a New York Yankees fan {{throughout his}} life. As an adult {{he was fond of}} science fiction movies, but often deplored their poor storytelling <b>and</b> <b>presentation</b> of science. His other interests included singing baritone in the Boston Cecilia, and he was a great aficionado of Gilbert and Sullivan operas. He collected rare antiquarian books, possessed an enthusiasm for architecture, and enjoyed city walks. He often traveled to Europe, and spoke French, German, Russian, and Italian. He sometimes alluded ruefully to his tendency to put on weight.|$|E
5|$|Karas, however, {{suffered}} the worst criticisms for its story. Many reviewers {{and even the}} voice actors could not follow its dialogue <b>and</b> <b>presentation.</b> Other reviewers felt the abstract presentation forced viewers who wanted to understand the story, to pay extreme attention to the scant details presented in the show. Reelfilm and DVD Verdict were more critical, stating the viewer {{should not have to}} resort to reading summaries on the packaging to make sense of a story populated with incoherent battles and characters hard to tell apart from.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{have liked}} finding contradictions; a common complaint, however, is the games' linearity, {{as well as}} how the player {{sometimes}} has to resort to a trial-and-error method due to the games only accepting specific pieces of evidence, and how testimony statements sometimes need to be pressed in a specific order. Some reviewers have criticized the lack of changes to the gameplay <b>and</b> <b>presentation</b> throughout the series, while some have said that fans of the series would not have a problem with this.|$|E
5|$|Since Madagascar gained {{independence}} from French colonial rule in 1960, Malagasy cuisine has reflected the island's diverse cultures and historic influences. Throughout the country, rice {{is considered the}} preeminent food and constitutes the main staple of the diet {{in all but the}} most arid regions of the south and west. Accompanying dishes served with rice vary regionally according to availability of ingredients and local cultural norms. Outside the home, Malagasy cuisine is served at simple roadside stalls (gargottes) or sit-down eateries (hotely). Snacks and rice-based meals may also be purchased from ambulatory street vendors. Upscale restaurants offer a wider variety of foreign cuisine and Malagasy dishes bearing French and other outside influences in preparation technique, ingredients <b>and</b> <b>presentation</b> alike.|$|E
5|$|The album title {{derives from}} the Dutch art {{movement}} of the same name; common elements of the De Stijl aesthetic are demonstrated on the album cover, which sets the band members against an abstract background of rectangles and lines in red, black and white.

5|$|The {{game has}} been mostly {{positively}} received by critics, who have appreciated its premise, writing, characters <b>and</b> <b>presentation.</b> The game {{has been a}} commercial success both in Japan and internationally, with the North American release selling higher than expectations and being hard to find in stores shortly after release.

5|$|The {{game was}} a {{critical}} and commercial success; with more than 3.5 million copies of the game sold, {{it is the most}} successful game by developer id Software to date.
