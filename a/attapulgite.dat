40|$|An {{account of}} recent {{progress}} and current work {{is given in}} a summarized form dealing mainly with clay investigations in C. S. I. R. O., an Australian government rese~irch organi-zation. Although some emphasis laid on the work designed to identify the nature and assess the properties of clays concerned with building-material manufacture, soils, and ceramics, there are several investigations which deal in a fundamental manner with the crystal struc-ture and surface properties of clay minerals. These items of general interest include projects {{on the structure of}} vermiculite, the rehydration and surface properties of kaolinites, the na-ture and occurrence of Australian illites and <b>attapulgites,</b> and a regular cxfoliation effect in montmorillonite suspensions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Organified <b>Attapulgites</b> (AT) were {{grafted with}} 3 -(trimethoxysilyl) propyl {{methacrylate}} (KH 570) {{on the surface}} of AT particles. Then, the modified AT (AT-g-KH 570) and untreated AT particles were compounded with polypropylene (PP) to prepare PP/AT-g-KH 570 and PP/AT composites respectively. The morphology, chemical structure and mechanical properties of the composites were also investigated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectra (FTIR) and mechanical testing. The FTIR results showed that the KH 570 is grafted on the AT particles. The tensile strength and izod impact strength of PP/AT-g-KH 570 composites were improved obviously than those of PP/AT composites. The izod impact strength of PP/AT-g-KH 570 composites show the maximum and was enhanced 50 % at 1 wt % loading, which contributed to homogeneous dispersion of particles and enhanced the interfacial interaction between modified AT particles and PP matrix...|$|R
50|$|<b>Attapulgite</b> clays are a {{composite}} of smectite and palygorskite. Smectites are expanding lattice clays, of which bentonite is a commonly known generic name for smectite clays. The palygorskite component is an acicular bristle-like crystalline form that does not swell or expand. <b>Attapulgite</b> forms gel structures in fresh and salt water by establishing a lattice structure of particles connected through hydrogen bonds.|$|E
50|$|Two {{companies}} {{are involved in}} the industrial extraction and processing of gellant-grade <b>attapulgite</b> clay within the same Attapulgus deposit: Active Minerals International, LLC, and BASF Corp. In 2008, BASF acquired the assets of Zemex <b>Attapulgite,</b> leaving only two gellant-grade producers. Active Minerals operates a dedicated factory to produce the patented product Actigel 208 and built a new state-of-the-art production process in early 2009 involving portable plant processing at the mine site.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} {{over the counter}} {{remedies}} for internal use that contained clay before discontinuation. Examples include Kaopectate (Upjohn), Rheaban (Leeming Div., Pfizer), and Diar-Aid (Thompson Medical Co.). The labels {{on all of these}} showed the active ingredient to be <b>Attapulgite,</b> each tablet containing 600 (or 750 mg) of this component along with inert materials or adjuvants.However, since April 2003, <b>attapulgite</b> medication was discontinued due to lack of evidence according to the U.S. Foods and Drugs Administration.|$|E
50|$|The synonym <b>attapulgite</b> {{is derived}} from the U.S. town of Attapulgus, in the extreme {{southwest}} corner of Georgia, where the mineral is abundant and surface-mined.|$|E
50|$|Fuller's {{earth is}} any clay {{material}} {{that has the}} capability to decolorize oil or other liquids without chemical treatment. Fuller's earth typically consists of palygorskite (<b>attapulgite)</b> or bentonite.|$|E
50|$|Until 2003, Kaopectate marketed in the US also {{contained}} <b>attapulgite.</b> However, at that time, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration retroactively rejected medical studies showing its efficacy, calling them insufficient. Kaopectate's U.S. formula {{was changed to}} bismuth subsalicylate (pink bismuth). The next year (2004), an additional change in labelling was made; from then on, Kaopectate was no longer recommended for children under 12 years old. Nevertheless, Kaopectate with <b>attapulgite</b> is still available in Canada and elsewhere. Until the early 1990s, Kaopectate used the similar clay product kaolinite with pectin (hence the name).|$|E
5000|$|The active {{ingredient}} in kaopectate {{has changed since}} its original creation. Originally, kaolinite {{was used as the}} adsorbent and pectin as the emollient. <b>Attapulgite</b> (a type of absorbent clay) replaced the kaolinite in the 1980s, but was found to be unproven as to effectiveness by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in a ruling made in April 2003. As a consequence, since 2004, bismuth subsalicylate has been used as the {{active ingredient}} in U.S. marketed products. [...] In Canada, McNeil Consumer Healthcare continues to market kaopectate using <b>attapulgite</b> as the active ingredient.|$|E
5000|$|The town's name is an Indian {{word meaning}} [...] "Dogwood"; {{due to the}} {{abundance}} of <b>attapulgite,</b> which makes up the clay soil {{throughout much of the}} Southeast, the mineral was named after the town.|$|E
50|$|Bentonite clay is {{available}} worldwide as a digestive aid; kaolin is also widely {{used as a}} digestive aid and as the base for some medicines. <b>Attapulgite,</b> another type of clay, is an active ingredient in many anti-diarrheal medicines.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Attapulgite</b> or {{palygorskite}} {{is a very}} absorbent clay, {{somewhat similar}} to bentonite. When used in medicine, it physically binds to acids and toxic substances in the stomach and digestive tract. For this reason, {{it has been used}} in several anti-diarrheal medications.|$|E
50|$|Gel-grade, dry-processed attapulgites {{are used}} in a very wide range of {{applications}} for suspension, reinforcement, and binding properties. Paints, sealants, adhesives, tape-joint compound, catalysts, suspension fertilizers, wild-fire suppressants, foundry coatings, animal feed suspensions, and molecular sieve binders {{are just a few}} uses of dry-process <b>attapulgite.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 7% - 10% <b>attapulgite</b> clay {{mixed with}} the {{eutectic}} salt, sodium sulfate decahydrate (Glaubers salt), keeps anhydrous crystals suspended in the solution, where they hydrate during phase transition and hence contribute to the heat absorbed and released when Glaubers salt is used for heat storage.|$|E

5000|$|Clays - <b>attapulgite</b> {{which also}} disperses suspensions, {{bentonite}} (both flocculating and non-flocculating), and other montmorillonite clays. Usually clays, when dry, {{exist as a}} very fine powder, facilitating dispersion and compatibility with other ingredients. Clays generally make matte surfaces, {{in spite of their}} fine particulate nature. Not only paints and inks, but other industries such as pharmaceutical, construction, and cosmetics, especially hair styling aids and facial detoxifying masks increasingly favor bentonite and <b>attapulgite</b> clays over other rheology modifiers, dispersion aids, opacifying fillers, antifoam, and numerous niche uses which exploit the numerous inherent qualities which have drawn artisans to this amazing material [...] Clays are sustainably sourced and do not involve any egregious environmental damage, which were among the cheapest bulk materials until recently, when the pricing went up steadily, following the upsurge in its use pattern.|$|E
50|$|Fuller's earth {{consists}} {{primarily of}} hydrous aluminum silicates (clay minerals) of varying composition. Common components are montmorillonite, kaolinite and <b>attapulgite.</b> Small amounts of other minerals {{may be present}} in fuller's earth deposits, including calcite, dolomite, and quartz. In some localities fuller's earth refers to calcium bentonite, which is altered volcanic ash composed mostly of montmorillonite.|$|E
50|$|Palygorskite or <b>attapulgite</b> is a {{magnesium}} aluminium phyllosilicate with formula (Mg,Al)2Si4O10(OH)·4(H2O) {{that occurs}} in a type of clay soil common to the Southeastern United States. It {{is one of the}} types of fuller's earth. Some smaller deposits of this mineral can be found in Mexico, where its use is tied to the manufacture of Maya blue in pre-Columbian times.|$|E
5000|$|... {{to soothe}} an upset stomach, {{similar to the}} way parrots (and later, humans) in South America {{originally}} used it (more recently, industrially-produced kaolinite preparations were common for treatment of diarrhea; the most common of these was kaopectate, which abandoned the use of kaolin in favor of <b>attapulgite</b> and then (in the United States) bismuth subsalicylate (the active ingredient in Pepto-Bismol)) ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Attapulgite,</b> {{unlike some}} {{bentonite}} (sodium rich montmorillonites can gel in sea water), forms gel structures in salt water {{and is used}} in special saltwater drilling mud for drilling formations contaminated with salt. Palygorskite particles {{can be considered as}} charged particles with zones of positive and negative charges. The bonding of these alternating charges allows them to form gel suspensions in salt and fresh water.|$|E
50|$|Kaopectate is an orally taken {{medication}} from Chattem, Inc. for {{the treatment}} of mild diarrhea. It is also sometimes used to treat indigestion, nausea and stomach ulcers. The active ingredients have varied over time, and are different between the United States and Canada. The original active ingredients were kaolinite and pectin. In the U.S., the active ingredient is now bismuth subsalicylate, the same as in Pepto-Bismol. In Canada, <b>attapulgite</b> is used.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Attapulgite</b> is used {{widely in}} medicine. Taken by mouth, it {{physically}} binds to acids and toxic substances {{in the stomach}} and digestive tract. Also, as an antidiarrheal, it was believed to work by adsorbing the bacteria or germ that may be causing the diarrhea. For this reason, {{it has been used}} in several antidiarrheal medications, including Diar-Aid, Diarrest, Diasorb, Diatabs, Diatrol, Donnagel, Kaopek, K-Pek, Parepectolin, and Rheaban. [...] It has been used for decades to treat diarrhea.|$|E
50|$|<b>Attapulgite</b> clays {{found in}} the Meigs-Quincy {{district}} are bundles of palygorskite clay particles between 2 and 3 μm long and below 3 nm in diameter. The bundles are surrounded by a matrix of smectite clays that are slightly swellable. Dry-process grades contain up to 25% nonattapulgite material {{in the form of}} carbonates and other mineral inclusions. Processing of the clays consist of drying and grinding the crude clay to specific particle size distributions with specific ranges of gel viscosity measured by a variety of means depending on the end use.|$|E

50|$|Borate salts used in {{the past}} to fight {{wildfires}} have been found to sterilize the soil and be toxic to animals so are now prohibited. Newer retardants use ammonium sulfate or ammonium polyphosphate with <b>attapulgite</b> clay thickener or diammonium phosphate with a guar gum derivative thickener. These are not only less toxic but act as fertilizers to help the regrowth of plants after the fire. Fire retardants often contain wetting agents, preservatives and rust inhibitors and are colored red with ferric oxide or fugitive color to mark where they have been dropped. Brand names of fire retardants for aerial application include Fire-Trol and Phos-Chek.|$|E
5000|$|Substances {{discontinued}} such as kaolin and <b>attapulgite</b> were formerly considered gastric demulcents {{and diarrhea}} medication, until official {{studies by the}} USFDA disproved these views. Clays are classified as excipients and their main side-effects are that of neutral excipients, which is to impair and slow down absorption of antibiotics, hormones and heart medication amongst others by coating the digestive tract [...] and this slowed down absorption can lead to increased toxicity of some medication (e.g. citrate salts) which can become toxic if not metabolized quickly enough, which is one contraindication of attapulgite.Usual mild side-effects are nausea, slowed down absorption of nutrients from food (in excess dosage of medicinal clay) and constipation.|$|E
50|$|Some {{substances}} {{cause cancer}} primarily through their physical, rather than chemical, effects on cells. A prominent {{example of this}} is prolonged exposure to asbestos, naturally occurring mineral fibers which are a major cause of mesothelioma, which is a cancer of the serous membrane, usually the serous membrane surrounding the lungs. Other substances in this category, including both naturally occurring and synthetic asbestos-like fibers such as wollastonite, <b>attapulgite,</b> glass wool, and rock wool, are believed to have similar effects. Non-fibrous particulate materials that cause cancer include powdered metallic cobalt and nickel, and crystalline silica (quartz, cristobalite, and tridymite). Usually, physical carcinogens must get inside the body (such as through inhaling tiny pieces) and require years of exposure to develop cancer.|$|E

50|$|Iran {{produces}} orpiment and realgar arsenic concentrates, silver, asbestos, borax, hydraulic cement, clays (bentonite, industrial, and kaolin), diatomite, feldspar, fluorspar, turquoise, industrial {{or glass}} sand (quartzite and silica), lime, magnesite, nitrogen (of ammonia and urea), perlite, natural ocher and iron oxide mineral pigments, pumice and related volcanic materials, caustic soda, stones and decorative stones (including granite, marble, travertine, dolomite, and limestone), celestite, natural sulfates (aluminum potassium sulfate and sodium sulfate), amber, tungsten, agate, lapislazuli and talc. Iran also produces ferromanganese, ferromolybdenum, nepheline syenite, demantoids, phosphate rock, selenium, shell, andalusite, rockwool, garnet, gabbro, diorite, vermiculite, <b>attapulgite,</b> calcium, barium, rare earth elements, scandium, yttrium and zeolite, {{and had the}} capacity to mine onyx. Iran also has large deposits of herbertsmithite around the city of Anarak.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{physical}} and chemical properties of some clays (such as the Lias Group) large swelling occurs when water is absorbed. Conversely when the water dries up these clays contract (shrink). The presence of these clay minerals is what allows soils to have the capacity to shrink and swell. Some of these clay minerals are: smectite, nontronite, bentonite, chlorite, montmorillonite, beidellite, <b>attapulgite,</b> illite and vermiculite. The amount of these minerals in a particular soil will also determine the severity of the shrink-swell capacity. For instance, soils {{with a small amount of}} expansive clay minerals will not expand as much when exposed to moisture as a soil with a large amount of the same clay minerals. If a soil is composed of at least 5 percent of these clay minerals by weight, it could have the ability to shrink and swell.|$|E
50|$|Suitably {{prepared}} hydrogels can simultaneously {{supply and}} slowly release pesticides (such as herbicides) in the soil, and increase a sandy soil's retention of water. Hydrogels developed {{for this purpose}} include polymers of oligooxyethylene methacrylate, linked by ionic and covalent bonds to a herbicide such as 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid (CMPA). Other hydrophilic polymers studied have been made {{from a variety of}} different acrylate monomers to release the pesticides 2,4-D and CMPA. These offer different combinations of pesticide release rate and soil water retention. Hydrogels {{can also be used to}} encapsulate the insecticide cypermethrin and the fungicide copper sulphate. Superabsorbent polymers can be used to release phosphate fertiliser slowly, by making an ester bond between polyvinyl alcohol and phosphoric acid. A polymer/clay superabsorbent composite material made by attaching acrylamide to finely powdered <b>attapulgite</b> (a fuller's earth clay) shows promise for its excellent water retention and low cost compared to polyacrylamide hydrogel.|$|E
