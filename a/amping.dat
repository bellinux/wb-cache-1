We have examined the conformational and biological properties of cyclic <b>AMP</b> receptor protein as a function of cyclic <b>AMP</b> concentrations, using the gal operon of E. coli. A biphasic behavior is observed. It is shown that only the complex formed at lower concentrations of cyclic <b>AMP</b> is the transcriptionally active form.
