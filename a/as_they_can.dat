In general, morels should not be eaten raw, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> trigger allergic reactions in susceptible individuals. Their flavor is enhanced after they are fried, stuffed, or dried.|$|E

5|$|Although several Roman sources {{including}} Livy and Polybius talk {{extensively about}} the Roman {{army of the}} Roman Kingdom period that followed the Etruscan capture of the city, no contemporary accounts survive. Polybius, for example, was writing some 300 years after the events in question, and Livy some 500 years later. Additionally, what records were kept by the Romans at this time were later destroyed when the city was sacked. The sources for this period cannot therefore be seen as reliable, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be for later military history, e.g. from the First Punic War onwards.|$|E

5|$|Another way to view {{surface tension}} is {{in terms of}} energy. A {{molecule}} in contact with a neighbor is in a lower state of energy than if it were alone (not in contact with a neighbor). The interior molecules have as many neighbors <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> possibly have, but the boundary molecules are missing neighbors (compared to interior molecules) and therefore have a higher energy. For the liquid to minimize its energy state, the number of higher energy boundary molecules must be minimized. The minimized number of boundary molecules results in a minimal surface area.|$|E
5|$|Ant {{societies}} have division of labour, communication between individuals, {{and an ability}} to solve complex problems. These parallels with human {{societies have}} long been an inspiration and subject of study. Many human cultures make use of ants in cuisine, medication, and rituals. Some species are valued in their role as biological pest control agents. Their ability to exploit resources may bring ants into conflict with humans, however, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> damage crops and invade buildings. Some species, such as the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), are regarded as invasive species, establishing themselves in areas where they have been introduced accidentally.|$|E
5|$|Common ixodid ticks {{collected}} from impala include Amblyomma hebraeum, Boophilus decoloratus, Hyalomma marginatum, Ixodes cavipalpus, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and R. evertsi. In Zimbabwe, heavy infestation by ticks such as R. appendiculatus {{has proved to}} be a major cause behind the high mortality of ungulates, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> lead to tick paralysis. Impala have special adaptations for grooming, such as their characteristic dental arrangement, to manage ticks before they engorge; however, the extensive grooming needed to keep the tick load under control involves the risk of dehydration during summer, lower vigilance against predators and gradual wearing out of the teeth. A study showed that impala adjust the time devoted to grooming and the number of grooming bouts according to the seasonal prevalence of ticks.|$|E

5|$|Concentrator {{photovoltaics}} (CPV) systems employ sunlight concentrated onto photovoltaic surfaces for {{the purpose}} of electrical power production. Contrary to conventional photovoltaic systems, it uses lenses and curved mirrors to focus sunlight onto small, but highly efficient, multi-junction solar cells. Solar concentrators of all varieties may be used, and these are often mounted on a solar tracker {{in order to keep the}} focal point upon the cell as the sun moves across the sky. Luminescent solar concentrators (when combined with a PV-solar cell) can also be regarded as a CPV system. Concentrated photovoltaics are useful <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> improve efficiency of PV-solar panels drastically.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus humilis clouds usually {{indicate}} fair weather. Cumulus mediocris {{clouds are}} similar, {{except that they}} have some vertical development, which implies that they can grow into cumulus congestus or even cumulonimbus clouds, which can produce heavy rain, lightning, severe winds, hail, and even tornadoes. Cumulus congestus clouds, which appear as towers, will often grow into cumulonimbus storm clouds. They can produce precipitation. Glider pilots often {{pay close attention to}} cumulus clouds, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be indicators of rising air drafts or thermals underneath that can suck the plane high into the skya phenomenon known as cloud suck.|$|E
5|$|Geneticists {{often use}} viruses as vectors to {{introduce}} genes into cells {{that they are}} studying. This is useful for making the cell produce a foreign substance, or to study the effect of introducing a new gene into the genome. In similar fashion, virotherapy uses viruses as vectors to treat various diseases, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> specifically target cells and DNA. It shows promising use {{in the treatment of}} cancer and in gene therapy. Eastern European scientists have used phage therapy as an alternative to antibiotics for some time, and interest in this approach is increasing, because of the high level of antibiotic resistance now found in some pathogenic bacteria.|$|E

5|$|In {{intelligent}} mammals, such as primates, the cerebrum {{is larger}} {{relative to the}} rest of the brain. Intelligence itself is not easy to define, but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn, matched with behavioral flexibility. Rats, for example, are considered to be highly intelligent, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> learn and perform new tasks, an ability that may be important when they first colonize a fresh habitat. In some mammals, food gathering appears to be related to intelligence: a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat, which must think to outwit its prey.|$|E
5|$|In rural areas, law {{enforcement}} that operates outside of incorporated cities {{may also have}} mounted units. These include specially deputised, paid or volunteer mounted search and rescue units sent into roadless areas on horseback to locate missing people. Law enforcement in protected areas may use horses in places where mechanised transport is difficult or prohibited. Horses can be {{an essential part of}} an overall team effort <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> move faster on the ground than a human on foot, can transport heavy equipment, and provide a more rested rescue worker when a subject is found.|$|E
5|$|Kalimpong {{is located}} off the National Highway 31A (NH31A), which links Sevok to Gangtok. The NH31A is an {{offshoot}} of the NH 31, which connects Sevok to Siliguri. These two National Highways together, via Sevok, links Kalimpong to the plains. Regular bus services and hired vehicles connect Kalimpong with Siliguri and the neighbouring towns of Kurseong, Darjeeling and Gangtok. Four wheel drives are popular means of transport, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> easily navigate the steep slopes in the region. However, road communication often get disrupted in the monsoons due to landslides. In the town, people usually travel by foot. Residents also use bicycle, two-wheelers and hired taxis for short distances.|$|E

Analgesics such as ibuprofen {{can be taken}} for headache, but paracetamol (acetaminophen) is preferred {{to minimize the risk}} of intracranial hemorrhage. Concussed individuals are advised not to use alcohol or other drugs that have not been approved by a doctor <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> impede healing. Activation database-guided EEG biofeedback has been shown to return the memory abilities of the concussed individual to levels better than the control group.|$|E
5|$|Ski flying is {{a winter}} sport {{discipline}} derived from ski jumping, in which much greater distances can be achieved. It {{is a form}} of competitive Nordic skiing where athletes descend individually at very fast speeds along a specially built takeoff ramp using skis only; jump from the end of it with as much power <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> generate; then glide – or 'fly' – as far as possible down a steeply sloped hill; and ultimately land within a target zone in a stable manner. Points are awarded for distance and stylistic merit by five judges, and events are governed by the International Ski Federation (FIS).|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} {{cetacean}} live in rivers and lakes, but are {{more closely related}} to oceanic dolphins or porpoises and entered fresh water more recently. Such species are considered facultative freshwater cetaceans <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> use both marine and freshwater environments. These include species such as the Irrawaddy dolphin, Orcaella brevirostris, found in the Mekong, Mahakam, the Irrawaddy Rivers, as well as the Yangtze finless porpoise Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaeorientalis.|$|E

5|$|The 20 {{amino acids}} that are encoded {{directly}} by the codons of the universal genetic code are called standard or canonical amino acids. A modified form of methionine (N-formylmethionine) is often incorporated in place of methionine as the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Other amino acids are called non-standard or non-canonical. Most of the non-standard amino acids are also non-proteinogenic (i.e. they cannot be incorporated into proteins during translation), but {{two of them are}} proteinogenic, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be incorporated translationally into proteins by exploiting information not encoded in the universal genetic code.|$|E
5|$|The addax mainly eats {{grasses and}} leaves of any {{available}} shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes. These animals are well-adapted {{to exist in}} their desert habitat, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> live without water {{for long periods of}} time. Addax form herds of five to 20 members, consisting of both males and females. They are led by the oldest female. Due to its slow movements, the antelope is an easy target for its predators: lions, humans, African wild dogs, cheetahs, and leopards. Breeding season is at its peak during winter and early spring. The natural habitat of the addax are arid regions, semideserts and sandy and stony deserts.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the work carried out by {{accountants}} and auditors requires a high level of ethics. Shareholders, potential shareholders, and other users of the financial statements rely heavily on the yearly financial statements of a company <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> use this information to make an informed decision about investment. They rely on the opinion of the accountants who prepared the statements, as well as the auditors that verified it, to present a true and fair view of the company. Knowledge of ethics can help accountants and auditors to overcome ethical dilemmas, allowing for the right choice that, although it may not benefit the company, will benefit the public who relies on the accountant/auditor's reporting.|$|E
