5|$|Any {{curve of}} {{constant}} width can form a rotor within a square, a shape that can perform a complete rotation while staying within the square and {{at all times}} touching all four sides of the square. However, the Reuleaux triangle is the rotor with the minimum possible area. As it rotates, its axis does not stay fixed <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> point, but instead follows a curve formed by the pieces of four ellipses. Because of its 120° angles, the rotating Reuleaux triangle cannot reach some points near the sharper angles at the square's vertices, but rather covers a shape with slightly rounded corners, also formed by elliptical arcs.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} colonial period, {{under the rule}} of the House of Bourbon, the ideas of the Enlightenment on public health and social control shaped the {{development}} of Lima. New buildings undertaken during this period include a cockfighting coliseum and a bullring, the Plaza de toros de Acho, as well as the General Cemetery. The first two were built to regulate these popular activities by centralizing them <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> venue, while the cemetery {{put an end to the}} practice of burials at churches which was considered unhealthy by public authorities.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, William Gray noticed a trend of low {{hurricane}} {{activity in the}} North Atlantic basin during El Niño years. He was the first researcher to make a connection between such events and positive results led him to pursue further research. He found numerous factors across the globe influence tropical cyclone activity, such as connecting wet periods over the African Sahel {{to an increase in}} major hurricane landfalls along the United States East Coast. However, his findings also showed inconsistencies when only looking <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> factor as a primary influence.|$|E

5|$|Nuclear waste {{policy in}} Germany is in flux. German {{planning}} for a permanent geologic repository began in 1974, focused on salt dome Gorleben, a salt mine near Gorleben about 100 kilometers northeast of Braunschweig. The site was announced in 1977 with plans for a reprocessing plant, spent fuel management, and permanent disposal facilities <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> site. Plans for the reprocessing plant were dropped in 1979. In 2000, {{the federal government and}} utilities agreed to suspend underground investigations for three to ten years, and the government committed to ending its use of nuclear power, closing one reactor in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Observations of the {{large-scale}} {{structure of the}} Universe, a branch known as physical cosmology, have provided a deep understanding of the formation and evolution of the cosmos. Fundamental to modern cosmology is the well-accepted theory of the big bang, wherein our Universe began <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> point in time, and thereafter expanded {{over the course of}} 13.8 billion years to its present condition. The concept of the big bang {{can be traced back to}} the discovery of the microwave background radiation in 1965.|$|E
5|$|On days of {{particular}} religious significance, the daily rituals were replaced with festival observances. Different festivals occurred at different intervals, though most were annual. Their timing {{was based on}} the Egyptian civil calendar, which most of the time was far {{out of step with the}} astronomical year. Thus, while many festivals had a seasonal origin, their timing lost its connection with the seasons. Most festivals took place <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> temple, but others could involve two or more temples or an entire region of Egypt; a few were celebrated throughout the country. In the New Kingdom and later, the festival calendar <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> temple could include dozens of events, so it is likely that most of these events were observed only by the priests. In those festivals that involved a procession outside the temple, the local population also gathered to watch and to celebrate. These were the most elaborate temple ceremonies, accompanied by the recitation of hymns and the performance of musicians.|$|E

Chris Hoy became Scotland's most successful Olympic competitor ever, and the first Briton to win three gold medals <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> Olympic Games since Henry Taylor in 1908. His success resulted in the velodrome for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow being named in his honour. Rebecca Romero became the first British woman to win a medal in two different Olympic sports by following her silver medal in the quadruple sculls rowing in 2004 with gold in the women's individual pursuit.|$|E
5|$|The net {{aerodynamic}} drag forces {{may be considered}} to act <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> point, called the center of pressure. At high speeds, this will create a net moment about the rear driving wheel and result in a net transfer of load from the front wheel to the rear wheel. Also, depending on {{the shape of the}} bike and the shape of any fairing that might be installed, aerodynamic lift may be present that either increases or further reduces the load on the front wheel.|$|E
5|$|The trophies Taylor won were {{collected}} and temporarily displayed at Chadderton Baths. In 1969 he was posthumously {{inducted into the}} International Swimming Hall of Fame. In 2002, a blue plaque was unveiled at Chadderton Baths commemorating his swimming achievements. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, Rebecca Adlington became the first British swimmer to win more than one gold medal <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> Olympic Games since Taylor won three in 1908.|$|E

5|$|Until 1914, {{artillery}} generally fired over open sights at visible targets, {{the largest}} unit accustomed to firing <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> target was the artillery regiment or brigade. One innovation {{brought about by}} the adoption of trench warfare was the barrage—a term first used in the battle of Neuve Chapelle in 1915. Trench warfare had created the need for indirect fire, with the use of observers, more sophisticated artillery fire plans, and an increasingly scientific approach to gunnery, where artillerymen had to use increasingly complicated calculations to lay the guns. Individual guns were aimed so that their fall of shot was coordinated with others to form a pattern; {{in the case of a}} barrage, the pattern was a line.|$|E

CFMI was made responsible for the day-to-day decision making for the project, while major decisions (developing a new variant, for example) required the go-ahead from GE and SNECMA management.|$|E
