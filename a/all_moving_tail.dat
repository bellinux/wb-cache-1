2500|$|Cody's {{previous}} {{designs were}} pusher canard biplanes, {{but the new}} aircraft was a tractor high-winged monoplane powered by a single 120hp (89kW) Austro-Daimler engine which had been fitted to an Etrich Taube which had crashed during the 1911 Circuit of Britain, which Cody had purchased after the race. It had a deep fuselage that accommodated the crew of two side-by-side. The tail arrangement was unusual, with two elevators [...] and two rudders carried on four bamboo booms that led back from the fuselage, the <b>all</b> <b>moving</b> <b>tail</b> surfaces forming a box shape. Fabric was stretched between the tail booms giving a cruciform shape as seen in cross-section. Lateral control was by means of wing warping, and the aircraft was fitted with a nosewheel undercarriage.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1974 {{the design}} of a new model was begun by Strauber and Frommhold, now {{operating}} as Ingenieur-Büro Strauber - Frommhold Gmbh. This became the Mistral-C or model 2 Mistral-C {{and was one of the}} first gliders to meet the specifications of the then new FAI Club Class. It first flew on 21 October 1976. The main changes were to the wings and, overall, to the construction materials. [...] As detailed in the Specification section below, the wing area was increased, though the span was unchanged, reducing the aspect ratio and consequentially the performance. [...] The new wings had different Wortmann sections, quarter chord forward sweep of 1.0° and dihedral 4.30°. GRP/PVC foam sandwich replaced the earlier balsa sandwich in the wings and the ailerons and fuselage were all GRP. As in the wings, the PMI foam in the tail was replaced by PVC and the <b>all</b> <b>moving</b> <b>tail</b> was changed to a fixed tailplane, fitted with a spring tab. [...] The canopy is side-hinged. [...] The Mistral-Cs produced by Valentin were little different, though the dihedral is reported to be 4.20°.|$|E

5000|$|It is a {{shoulder}} wing competition sailplane. The first aircraft, the Phoebus A, {{was designed to}} Standard Class rules, with a span of 15 m. Its straight tapered wings have an aspect ratio of 17.1; airbrakes are fitted at 70% chord. The fin and rudder are straight edged and only slightly tapered, with a high aspect ratio <b>all</b> <b>moving</b> T <b>tail</b> mounted at the tip. The fuselage is a monocoque. with the cockpit, ahead of the wings, enclosed with a one piece canopy. The Phoebus A has a monowheel plus tail bumper undercarriage, but in the later variants the main wheel is retractable. [...] The Phoebus C has a braking parachute.|$|R

50|$|Working {{closely with}} NASA's Langley Research Center, the company {{invested}} significant Internal Research and Development (IRAD) funds for wind tunnel testing {{and that led}} to the Model 400. It featured <b>all</b> <b>moving</b> wing tips for roll control and an <b>all</b> <b>moving</b> vertical <b>tail.</b> These surfaces were actually the horizontal tail surfaces from the F-16A. These surfaces were later dropped as they did not provide adequate control at low speed, high angle of attack. Also, {{there would have been no}} provision for wing-tip mounted missiles. The main wing incorporated forebody strakes to enhance vortex generation for high angle of attack maneuverability, negative stability for improved subsonic lift and reduced supersonic drag. It was built around a 40-inch fuselage stretch. Both the large wing and fuselage stretch yielded a dramatic increase in range at all speeds. In 1979, with a strong positive response by the USAF, GD released the Model 400 for a company funded preliminary design effort.|$|R
50|$|As an RAE {{test pilot}} he was {{involved}} in the wartime Miles M.52 supersonic project, test flying a Spitfire fitted with the M.52's <b>all</b> <b>moving</b> <b>tail,</b> diving from high altitude to achieve high subsonic speeds. He was due to fly the M.52 in 1946, but this fell through when the project was cancelled. The <b>all</b> <b>moving</b> <b>tail</b> information, however, supplied upon instruction from the British government ostensibly as part of an information exchange with the Americans (although no information was ever received in return), allowed Bell to modify its XS-1 for true transsonic pitch controllability, in turn allowing Chuck Yeager to become the first man to exceed Mach 1 in 1947.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Darmstadt was a plywood skinned, oval cross sectioned semi-monocoque, slightly tapered {{and more}} rounded towards the tail. The open, unscreened cockpit was placed immediately {{ahead of the}} wing leading edge with the pilot's head against {{the front of a}} low, long chord, faired pylon which supported the wing. A short undercarriage skid was attached to the fuselage underside, aided by a small tailskid. The D-17 had <b>all</b> <b>moving</b> <b>tail</b> surfaces with straight edges, rounded tips and tapered by forward sweep on their trailing edges. The large rudder extended to the keel, moving in a cut-out in the one piece elevator.|$|E
50|$|The {{straight}} tapered, <b>all</b> <b>moving</b> <b>tail</b> of the Squale is also wooden, with a ply covered {{leading edge}} and fabric covering aft. It is shoulder {{mounted on the}} fuselage. The early Squales lacked elevator feel, so anti-balance tabs were added on the WA 26M version. The straight edged, swept fin and rudder, the latter horn balanced, are GRP structures, integral with the fuselage. This has an oval section which gradually increases in diameter forwards to the wings. There is a retractable monowheel undercarriage, fitted with an hydraulic brake and assisted by a small, fixed tailskid. The pilot's semi-reclining position is under a long, single piece canopy which hinges to port.|$|E

5000|$|Recognition that wooden-winged gliders were {{becoming}} outdated {{resulted in a}} redesigned wing, aerodynamically {{the same as the}} WA 26 Squale but built of GRP and fitted with Schempp-Hirth rather than trailing edge airbrakes. This led to the WA 28 Espadon, the new wing mounted on a Squale fuselage with a GRP <b>all</b> <b>moving</b> <b>tail</b> in place of the Squale's wooden one. The Espadon is 20-25 kg (44-55 lb) heavier than the Squale; its best glide ratio is 1:36 at 88 km/h (55 mph). [...] It first flew in May 1974 and went into production that November; by the Spring of 1975, 20 were on order. It soon became apparent that competitors like the Schleicher ASW 15 had significantly better performance and production did not continue for long.|$|E

50|$|The {{collared}} falconet is a {{very small}} falcon, shrike-like in shape, mainly pied and having bold white supercilia and collar, with relatively heavy double-toothed bill. It has shortish wings, a medium-length tail, strong half-feathered legs, and powerful feet. It perches conspicuously on top or edge of tree or bush, often on dead twig, frequently bobbing head and slowly <b>moving</b> <b>tail</b> up and down; wing-tips less than half down tail.

In another common scheme, the snake has a specific length, so there is a <b>moving</b> <b>tail</b> a fixed number of units away from the head. The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border, a trail or other obstacle, or itself.|$|R
