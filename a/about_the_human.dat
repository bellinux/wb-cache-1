With her best friend Flounder, Ariel collects human artifacts in her grotto, and often goes {{to the surface of the}} ocean to visit Scuttle, a seagull who offers very inaccurate knowledge of human culture. She ignores the warnings of her father King Triton, the ruler of Atlantica, and Sebastian, a crab who serves as Triton's adviser and court composer, that contact between merpeople and humans is forbidden.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Wallace was {{drawn into the}} debate over {{mandatory}} smallpox vaccination. Wallace originally saw the issue {{as a matter of}} personal liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the germ theory of disease was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew enough <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> immune system to understand why vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, in a few cases completely phony, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.|$|E
5|$|Motion picture company Nippon Eigasha started sending cameramen to Nagasaki and Hiroshima in September 1945. On October 24, 1945, a U.S. {{military}} policeman {{stopped a}} Nippon Eigasha cameraman from continuing to film in Nagasaki. All Nippon Eigasha's reels were then confiscated by the American authorities. These reels were in turn {{requested by the}} Japanese government, declassified, and saved from oblivion. Some black-and-white motion pictures were released and shown {{for the first time}} to Japanese and American audiences in the years from 1968 to 1970. The public release of film footage of the city post-attack, and some research <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> effects of the attack, was restricted during the occupation of Japan, and much of this information was censored until the signing of the San Francisco Peace Treaty in 1951, restoring control to the Japanese.|$|E

5|$|Denise Wong, the Calgarian {{actor who}} portrayed Number 18 in the premiere, {{said that the}} play was <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> condition. Evelyn Chew, the Vancouverite actor {{who took over the}} role for the 2012 tour, said that the play is intense because it unabashedly deals with human trafficking, and that builds in {{intensity}} to its climax. Sienna Howell-Holden, who played Mama in the premiere and the 2012 tour, said that many audience members had not been previously familiar with 21st-century human trafficking. The character of Mama calls {{attention to the fact that}} poverty in the Third World fuels sex trafficking. Stephen Waldschmidt said he hoped that the play will educate Canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on what they learn, thereby turning them into anti-sexual slavery activists. He also said he hoped that the play will put a face on the million women and children sold into sexual slavery each year worldwide. Because of the play's heavy themes, producers of the first performances issued an advisory for parents. Waldschmidt also stressed the amount of action in the play and said that, if the play was a film, it would receive a PG-13 rating and would be billed a thriller. He also said it was difficult to stage a play that is inherently sexual and extremely violent in nature without making it feel pornographic. Waldschmidt said that he wanted to stage She Has a Name partially to show how horrible human trafficking is and partially because the play is so theatrically gripping.|$|E

25|$|There is {{some debate}} {{about whether or not}} Ibn al-Nafis participated in {{dissection}} to come to his conclusions about pulmonary circulation. Although he states in his writings that he was prevented from practicing dissection because of his beliefs, other scholars have noted that al-Nafis must have either practiced dissection or seen a human heart in order to come to his conclusions. According to one view, his knowledge <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> heart could have been derived from surgical operations rather than dissection. Other comments found in al-Nafis’s writings such as dismissing earlier observations with a reference to dissection as proof, however, support the view that he practiced dissection in order to come to his conclusions <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> heart and pulmonary circulation. Ibn al-Nafis’s comments to the contrary and the alternate explanations, however, keep his possible practice of dissection in question.|$|E

25|$|In Passion: An Essay on Personality, Unger {{explores the}} {{individual}} and his relation to society {{from the perspective of}} the root human predicament of the need to establish oneself as a unique individual in the world but at the same time to find commonality and solidarity with others. This exploration is grounded in what Unger calls a modernist image of the human being as one who lives in context but is not bound by context. Unger's aim is to level a critique, expansion, and defense of modern thinking <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> and society.|$|E
25|$|Unger’s aim is twofold. First, {{to level}} a critique, expansion, and defense of modern {{thinking}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>human</b> and society “so that this practice can better withstand the criticisms that philosophy since Hume and Kant has leveled against it.” And second, {{to develop a}} prescriptive theory of human identity centered on what Unger calls the passions—our raw responses {{to the world that}} are ambivalent towards reasons but also act in the service of reason. He outlines nine passions that organize and are organized by our dealings with others: lust, despair, hatred, vanity, jealousy, envy, faith, hope, and love. While these emotional states may be seen as raw emotion, their expression is always conditioned by the context within which the individual mobilizes or learns to mobilize them.|$|E
