40|$|Abstract Return on assets (ROA) from {{household}} {{enterprise is}} crucial for understanding the wellbeing and productivity of households in developing economies. Yet the definition and measurement of household enterprise ROA remain inconsistent or unclear. We illustrate potential measurement problems with examples from various actual surveys. We then {{take advantage of a}} detailed integrated household survey to perform a robustness analysis, acting as if we had gathered less data than was actually the case, to see what matters and for whom. The three issues that matter most for accurate measurement of household enterprise ROA are the choice of accrual versus cash basis of income, the treatment of household’s own labor in enterprise income, and the treatment of non-factor income. Also, this sensitivity matters most for a relatively poor region dominated by crop cultivation relative to a richer region with non-farm enterprises. Though the choice between <b>accrued</b> <b>income</b> and cash income matters less when the frequency of the data declines, there remains high sensitivity in longer-term and annualized data. We conclude the paper by providing recommendations on how to improve the survey questionnaires for more accurate measurement in field research...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} {{teaching}} and learning mathematical functions. 1 Functions are all around us, though students do not always realize this. For example, a functional relationship between quantities is at play when we are paying for gasoline by the gallon or fruit by the pound. We need func-tions for financial plans so we can calculate such things as <b>accrued</b> <b>income</b> and interest. Functions are important as well to interpretations of local and world demographics and population growth, which are critical for economic planning and development. Functions are even found in such familiar set-tings as baseball statistics and metric conversions. Algebraic tools allow us to express these functional relationships very efficiently; find the value of one thing (such as the gas price) when we know {{the value of the}} other (the number of gallons); and display a relationship visually in a way that allows us to quickly grasp the direction, magnitude, and rate of change in one variable over a range of values of the other. For simple problems such as determining gas prices, students ’ existing knowl-edge of multiplication will usually allow them to calculate the cost for a specific amount of gas once they know the price per gallon (say, $ 2) with no problem. Students know that 2 gallons cost $ 4, 3 gallons cost $ 6, 4 gallons cost $ 8, and so on. While we can list each set of values, it is very efficient to say that for all values in gallons (which we call x by convention), the total cost (which we call y by convention), is equal to 2 x. Writing y = 2 x is a simple way of saying a great deal. As functional relationships become more complex, as in the growth of a population or the accumulation of interest over time, solutions are not so easily calculated because the base changes each period. In these situations...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether a}} taxpayer should have “standing” in international dispute resolutions. To {{answer this question}} the primary task is to identify the nature of international taxation. In other words, this paper discusses how to classify the field of international taxation. Is it part of public international law, private international law (i. e., conflict of laws), national (domestic) law, {{or is it a}} hybrid field that requires specific attention? Making this distinction is vital for resolving disputes when a taxpayer is taxed twice for cross-border transactions in cases where the double tax convention is unclear and both contracting states claim full or partial tax on <b>accrued</b> <b>income.</b> In 1924, the Permanent Court of International Justice defined dispute as “disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests between two persons. ” In the case brought before the Court in 1924, it determined that the dispute started between an individual and a state, but then the individual’s government “took up the case. The dispute then entered upon a new phase; it entered the domain of international law, and became a dispute between two States. ” If we analogize that case to a tax case derived by a cross-border transaction, {{there is no doubt that}} we have a dispute — a dispute on tax liability. But there are still two lingering doubts. First, is it an international dispute? And second, who are the parties to it? If one examines the current mechanisms available in the OECD Model Tax Convention for resolving double taxation disputes, one realizes that the taxpayer’s standing is somewhat ambiguous. In order to clarify this ambiguity we need to address the question of categorizing the conflict as a national or international one. The question at stake is whether a taxpayer should be a party to the dispute resolution process. In this paper, the cases cited are limited to where double tax treaties apply. I reserve the cases where they are inapplicable to further discussion. Part I highlights the tax complexity arising from cross-border transactions. Since the article focuses on OECD Model dispute resolution mechanisms, Part II briefly introduces the model’s history and its official aims. Part III discusses the available dispute resolution mechanism in the OECD Model — the Mutual Agreement Process (MAP) and Arbitration. Part IV reviews the hybrid elements of international taxation. This paper suggests that international taxation has both national and international characteristics. This hybrid nature is the basis of the discussion in Part V: after identifying the parties to the international tax dispute, this paper suggests two solutions to the research question — the apparent and normative solutions. In the former, a taxpayer should have standing in the international dispute, though recall that this solution is not based on normative grounds. The normative rationale introduces the equity principle whereby taxpayers should have no official role in resolving the dispute. Finally, this paper offers a brief recommendation in Part VI...|$|E

40|$|This article {{critically}} analyses {{the challenges}} e-commerce poses {{to the traditional}} source- and residence-based taxation systems.

40|$|This study {{looks at}} the impact of {{non-traditional}} crops on farmers income focusing on the cultivation of birds-eye chili in two rural communities in Ghana. The two communities selected for this study both display the emerging characteristics of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa who are gradually shifting from attempting to raise yields of current crops to the cultivation of new, high value export crops in order to <b>accrue</b> higher <b>incomes.</b> A qualitative research method was employed to understand {{the factors that influence}} farmers to shift to the cultivation of birds-eye chili, the problems that are encountered in this new activity and most importantly the effect this has on their incomes. Elements of the popular sustainable livelihoods framework were adopted for analysing the impacts. The study revealed a number of issues relevant to the discourse on improving incomes of smallholders. The study confirmed the shift of some smallholders to cultivation of new, high value export crops such as birds-eye chili. Again the study provided evidence of a unique brand of farming known as block farming in one of the two communities and how this is contributing to higher incomes compared to traditional methods of farming. Challenges that are faced by birds-eye chili farmers were also identified and the extents to which these challenges impact <b>incomes</b> <b>accrued</b> from the activity were explored as well.

In particular we compute the individual changes in logarithmic earnings between t and t+r and we then collapse them in country-year-occupation cells. On the one hand, we may expect a positive effect of immigration on wages, due to the occupational upgrade identified before. On the other, occupation upgrading needs not imply significantly higher wages for an individual. In fact, it may take longer than 4 years to <b>accrue</b> measurable <b>income</b> effects. Moreover, immigrant competition may decrease the occupational wages at low level of the ranking (see for instance Bratsberg and Raaum 2012) so that climbing up the occupational ladder simply offsets those potential wage decreases.
