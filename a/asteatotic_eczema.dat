5000|$|Xerotic eczema (<b>asteatotic</b> <b>eczema,</b> eczema craquele, eczema craquelatum, winter itch, {{pruritus}} hiemalis) is {{dry skin}} that becomes so serious {{it turns into}} eczema. It worsens in dry winter weather, and limbs and trunk are most often affected. The itchy, tender skin resembles a dry, cracked, river bed. This disorder is very common among the older population. Ichthyosis is a related disorder. (ICD-10 L30.8A; L85.0) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Clinical {{practice}} in dermatology indicates that alpha-tocopherol acetate is beneficial in xerosis, hyperkeratosis, <b>asteatotic</b> <b>eczema,</b> atopic dermatitis, superficial burns, cutaneous ulcers, onychoschizia and, in general, skin diseases {{in which an}} inflammatory process is activated. The positive effect results from the combination of biological activity, the absence of adverse reactions, and the physical effect of the alpha-tocopherol acetate oil. The viscosity of this oil in bulk phase accounts for a remarkable moisturizing effect and minimization of transepidermal water loss. This effect combines well with the antioxidant capacity of alpha-tocopherol released from the ester, and the recently emerging effect on reprogramming of gene expression...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the prevalence of skin diseases among soldiers who were assigned duties in Kahramanmaras, a province of east Mediterranean region of Turkey. One hundred eighty-eight soldiers were assessed for skin diseases by a complete dermatological examination and the findings were recorded to a form. Apart from the low number of older ones, the soldiers were of 20 – 22 years. The diagnosis of superficial fungal infections {{was made by the}} use of potassium hydroxide preparations in addition to clinical appearance. On completion of the study period, the data were evaluated, and patients were grouped. Pitted keratolysis was the primary dermatologic disease in 34. 5 % of the soldiers, 29. 2 % were diagnosed with oral candidiasis, and 25. 5 % suffered from tinea pedis. Among the soldiers suffering from a cutaneous disease, dyshidrotic eczema (18. 6 %), intertrigo (excluding candidal intertrigo) (17 %), acne (17 %), seborrheic dermatitis (14. 9 %), plantar hyperkeratosis (14. 3 %), contact dermatitis (13. 8 %), and folliculitis (12. 2 %) were the other most frequent dermatoses. Other less frequent dermatoses were <b>asteatotic</b> <b>eczema,</b> callus, onychomycosis, traumatic onychodystrophy, and so on. We conclude that the prevalence of skin diseases in soldiers is very high {{and is one of the}} major public health problems that have a significant burden on our nation...|$|E
40|$|The {{geriatric}} {{population is}} continuously growing, {{which leads to}} more aged patients being admitted to dermatology clinics. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the dermatological complaints of the elderly attending a dermatology outpatient clinic. All of the patients aged 65 years and older admitted to our dermatology outpatient clinic over a 1 -year period were included. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to their ages as group I (65 - 74 years) and group II (≥ 75 years). The patients were asked about their dermatologic complaints. A total of 240 geriatric patients attended to the dermatology outpatient clinic over a 1 -year period. Overall, the five most frequent dermatologic complaints of the patients were eczematous dermatitis (21. 7 %), pruritus (19. 6 %), fungal infections (16. 7 %), precancerous and malignant lesions (9. 6 %), and bacterial infections (7. 1 %). The most frequent types of eczematous dermatitis were <b>asteatotic</b> <b>eczema</b> (26. 9 %), neurodermatitis (26. 9 %), and stasis dermatitis (17. 3 %). Among fungal infections, the most frequent was tinea pedis (62. 5 %), followed by onychomycosis (32. 5 %) and tinea versicolor (5. 0 %). The most common precancerous lesion was actinic keratosis (78. 3 %). Bacterial infections encountered were pyoderma (58. 8 %), cellulitis (23. 5 %), and erythrasma (17. 6 %). Most of the skin problems in the elderly are preventable or treatable, so proper skin care and treatment of skin diseases should be emphasized in general health care for the elderly. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{pattern of}} eczema is altered by geography, habits {{of people and}} {{environmental}} factors and regional variation in skin structure and function. Aims: Our study was done to estimate frequency and patterns of {{lower leg and foot}} eczemas. Methods: A total of 200 patients with various types of lower leg and foot eczemas were recruited over a period of 2 years. Demographic and clinical characteristics were noted. Suspected cases of allergic contact dermatitis were patch tested. Results: The frequency of these eczemas was 2. 5 per 1000 out patients. Mean age of patients was 40. 49 years. Female to male ratio was 1. 6 : 1. Sixty (30 &#x 0025;) patients were farmers, sixty (30 &#x 0025;) were housewives, forty (20 &#x 0025;) were students, nineteen (9. 5 &#x 0025;) were daily laborers, nine had sedentary jobs and three were teachers. Most eczemas were bilateral (72 &#x 0025;). Mean duration of eczema was 36. 6 months. Most common type of eczema was lichen simplex chronicus (36 &#x 0025;) followed by discoid eczema (18. 5 &#x 0025;), allergic contact dermatitis (14. 5 &#x 0025;) and stasis eczema (7. 5 &#x 0025;). Other eczemas noted were juvenile plantar dermatosis, cumulative irritant contact dermatitis, infected eczema, hyperkeratotic eczema, <b>asteatotic</b> <b>eczema,</b> pompholyx, infective eczema and unclassified endogenous eczema. Common sites of involvement were dorsa of feet (49. 5 &#x 0025;), followed by lateral aspect of lower leg (31 &#x 0025;), medial aspect of lower leg (17. 5 &#x 0025;) and ankle (12 &#x 0025;). Conclusion : Our study highlights lichen simplex chronicus as the most common eczema affecting the lower legs and feet...|$|E

The treatments for AE are mainly emollients, usually containing urea, lactic acid, or a lactate salt. N-palmitoylethanolamine (PEA) and N-acetylethanolamine (AEA) are both endogenous lipids used as novel therapeutic tools {{in the treatment of}} many skin diseases. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare a PEA/AEA emollient with a traditional emollient in the treatment of AE. Methods: A monocentric, randomized, double-blind, comparative trial was conducted in 60  AE patients to evaluate and compare the efficacy of the two emollients. The level of skin dryness among the subjects ranged from mild to moderate. The subjects’ skin barrier function and the current perception threshold were tested for 28  days by clinical scoring and bioengineering technology. Results: The results showed that, although some aspects were improved in both groups, the group using the emollient containing PEA/AEA presented a better skin surface change in capacitance. However, the most impressive finding was the ability of the PEA/AEA emollient to increase the 5  Hz current perception threshold to a normal level after 7  days, with a significant difference between values at baseline and after 14  days. A current perception threshold of 5  Hz was positively and significantly correlated with skin surface hydration and negatively correlated with transepidermal water loss in the PEA/AEA emollient group. Conclusion: Compared with traditional emollients, regular application of a topical PEA/AEA emollient could improve both passive and active skin functions simultaneously.
