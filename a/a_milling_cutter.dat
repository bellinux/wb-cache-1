25|$|The process uses <b>a</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> with a {{cross-section}} that is slightly {{smaller than the}} final cross-section of the cut; {{it has the same}} diameter as the worm. The cutter is then angled to the gashing angle. The gashing angle is calculated from the lead and pitch diameter of the worm; often tables are available with the gashing angles for common diameters and leads. The cutter is centered over the blank and then plunged into it to the proper depth. The cutter is finally withdrawn and the blank indexed to the next tooth space and cut. This is repeated until all of the tooth spaces have been cut.|$|E
2500|$|Milling is {{the complex}} shaping of metal or other {{materials}} by removing material {{to form the}} final shape. It is generally done on a milling machine, a power-driven machine that in its basic form consists of <b>a</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> that rotates about the spindle axis (like a drill), and a worktable that can move in multiple directions (usually two dimensions [...] relative to the workpiece).

5000|$|The {{most common}} tool styles used in arbor milling are: double angle, form relived, plane, and {{staggered}} tooth Among many other tool styles. The double angle <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> can make <b>a</b> {{wide variety of}} V shaped cuts with straight surfaces in the material. <b>A</b> form relieved <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> can produce U shaped cuts with curved surfaces, unlike the double angle cutter, into the material. <b>A</b> plane <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> can produce surfaces similar to a planer but can make varying contours across the material. <b>A</b> staggered tooth <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> can produce <b>a</b> rectangular groove in the material at varying depths and widths.

50|$|The cutting {{surfaces}} of <b>a</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> are generally {{made of a}} hard and temperature-resistant material, so that they wear slowly. A low cost cutter may have surfaces made of high speed steel. More expensive but slower-wearing materials include cemented carbide.

5000|$|Helix angle: The flutes of <b>a</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> {{are almost}} always helical. If the flutes were straight, the whole tooth would impact the {{material}} at once, causing vibration and reducing accuracy and surface quality. Setting the flutes at an angle allows the tooth to enter the material gradually, reducing vibration. Typically, finishing cutters have a higher rake angle (tighter helix) to give a better finish.|$|E

50|$|The spindle speeds may be {{calculated}} for all machining operations once the SFM or MPM is known. In most cases {{we are dealing}} with a cylindrical object such as <b>a</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> or a workpiece turning in a lathe so we need to determine the speed at the periphery of this round object. This speed at the periphery (of a point on the circumference, moving past a stationary point) will depend on the rotational speed (RPM) and diameter of the object.|$|E
50|$|Selecting <b>a</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> is not {{a simple}} task. There are many variables, {{opinions}} and lore to consider, but essentially the machinist is trying to choose a tool which will cut the material to the required specification for the least cost. The cost of the job is a combination of the price of the tool, the time taken by the milling machine, and the time taken by the machinist. Often, for jobs {{of a large number of}} parts, and days of machining time, the cost of the tool is lowest of the three costs.|$|E
50|$|An {{indexing}} head, {{also known}} as a dividing head or spiral head, is a specialized tool that allows a workpiece to be circularly indexed; that is, easily and precisely rotated to preset angles or circular divisions.

Common jobs for a dividing head include machining the flutes of <b>a</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutter,</b> cutting the teeth of a gear, milling curved slots, or drilling a bolt hole circle around the circumference of a part.|$|E

50|$|Milling is {{a cutting}} process that uses <b>a</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> to remove {{material}} {{from the surface of}} a workpiece. The milling cutter is a rotary cutting tool, often with multiple cutting points. As opposed to drilling, where the tool is advanced along its rotation axis, the cutter in milling is usually moved perpendicular to its axis so that cutting occurs on the circumference of the cutter. As the milling cutter enters the workpiece, the cutting edges (flutes or teeth) of the tool repeatedly cut into and exit from the material, shaving off chips (swarf) from the workpiece with each pass. The cutting action is shear deformation; material is pushed off the workpiece in tiny clumps that hang together {{to a greater or lesser}} extent (depending on the material) to form chips. This makes metal cutting somewhat different (in its mechanics) from slicing softer materials with a blade.|$|E

The present study addresses machining of free-form surfaces on a 3 -axis NC machine tool.

[...] Roberts adopted rotary cutters, which he had seen used at Maudslays. This is one of the earliest records of <b>a</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> used in engineering. In 1816 he made the first reliable wet gas meter. In 1817 he made a lathe able to turn work 6 ft. This had a back gear to give an increased range of speeds, and a sliding saddle to move the tool along the work. The saddle was driven by a screw through gearing which could be disengaged when the end of the cut was reached. Also in 1817 he built a planing machine to allow the machining of flat surfaces. Previous to this flat surfaces were laboriously made by hand with the fitter using hammers and chisels, files and scrapers to get a true surface.|$|E
