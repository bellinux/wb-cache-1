40|$|A {{number of}} calcium buffers were {{examined}} {{for their ability}} to reduce evoked transmitter release when injected into the presynaptic terminal of the squid giant synapse. Injection of EGTA was virtually ineffective at reducing transmitter re-lease, even at estimated intracellular concentrations up to 80 mu. Conversely, the buffer 1, 2 -bis(2 -aminophe-noxy) ethane-/V,N,N’,N’-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), which has an equilibrium affinity for calcium similar to that of EGTA at pH 7. 2, produced a substantial reduction in transmitter re-lease when injected presynaptically. This effect of BAPTA was reversible, presumably because the buffer diffused out of the terminal and into uninjected regions of the presynaptic axon.

40|$|SUMMARY – Effective {{procedures}} of vaccination against lactococcosis in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) {{are still under}} investigation and the methods currently employed are based on “autovaccines” that are injected intraperitoneally to fish. These vaccines allow a protection for 8 months, when integrated with adjuvants. The bacterial antigenic components involved in the protection are only partially considered by the literature. This investigation concerns the effect of some fractions of Lactococcus garvieae {{in the development of}} a protective immune response to the infection. Extracellular products (ECPs), bacterial whole cells (WCs) and membrane antigens (<b>AM)</b> <b>were</b> injected intraperitoneum to 90 g. rainbow trouts. Fish were subsequently submitted to an intraperitoneal challenge with L. garvieae (2. 6 × 105 cfu/individual). The treatments allowed the following relative percentages of survival (RPS) : 95 % for WCs; 35 % for ECPs, 33 % for AM. These results suggest that WCs give the best protection, but also ECPs and <b>AM</b> <b>are</b> <b>effective.</b> Samples of serum collected from immunized and control fish were analysed by immunoblotting against the SDS-PAGE/Western Blotting protein profile of each bacterial fraction. The control and immunized fish sera contained immunoglobulins able to bind aspecifically the proteins having a molecular weight of 23, 48 and 102 kDa respectively...|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the ability of}} cryopreserved rabbit amniotic membrane (AM) transplantation to reduce postoperative inflammation {{and the extent of}} fibrosis following experimental strabismus surgery. Ten white rabbits underwent bilateral superior rectus (SR) muscle resection. In the left eye, the resected SR muscle was wrapped with cryopreserved rabbit AM. The right eye underwent SR resection only and served as a control. The eyes were enucleated 4 weeks after strabismus surgery. The degree of postoperative inflammatory infiltration, the extent of fibrosis, and profile of the relative expression of inflammatory mediators in the SR muscle were evaluated and compared between the two groups by histological analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). There were statistically meaningful differences in the degree of postoperative inflammatory infiltration and extent of fibrosis between the eyes treated with cryopreserved rabbit AM after SR resection and those underwent SR resection only. A significant decrease in the expression of inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL) - 12 a, IL- 12 b, IL- 17 f, and tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF-α) ], and a markedly increased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (transforming growth factor-beta- 1 (TGFβ- 1) and IL- 10) were observed in the eyes treated with cryopreserved rabbit AM. In this study, we demonstrate that cryopreserved rabbit <b>AM</b> <b>is</b> <b>effective</b> in reducing postoperative inflammation and extent of fibrosis in a rabbit model of strabismus surgery.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the healing process}} after severe corneal epithelial damage in rats treated with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) cultured with or without keratinocyte growth factor (KGF- 2) and autologous serum (AS) on amniotic membrane (<b>AM).</b> Many patients <b>are</b> blind and devastated by severe ocular surface diseases due to limbal stem cell deficiency. Bone marrow-derived MSCs are potential sources for cell-based tissue engineering to repair or replace the corneal tissue, having the potential to differentiate to epithelial cells. METHODS: The study included 5 groups each including 10 female “Sprague Dawley” rats in addition to 20 male rats used as bone marrow donors. Group I rats received AM+MSCs, Group II rats AM+MSCs cultured with KGF- 2, Group III rats AM+MSCs cultured with KGF- 2 +AS, Group IV rats only AM and Group V rats, none. AS was derived from blood drawn from male rats and bone marrow {{was obtained from the}} femur and tibia bones of the same animals. Therapeutic effect was evaluated with clinical, histopathological and immunohistochemical assessment. MSC engraftment was demonstrated via detection of donor genotype (Y+) in the recipient tissue (X) with polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Corneal healing was significantly better in Groups I-III rats treated with MSC transplantation compared to Group IV and Group V rats with supportive treatment only. The best results were obtained in Group III rats with 90 % transparency, 70 % lack of neovascularization, and 100 % epithelium damage limited to less than 1 / 4 of cornea. CONCLUSION: We suggest that culture of MSCs with KGF- 2 and AS on <b>AM</b> <b>is</b> <b>effective</b> in corneal repair in case of irreversible damage to limbal stem cells...|$|R
40|$|Acid soil is {{commonly}} grown with cassava, which in general, tolerate low soil fertility and aluminum (Al) toxicity. However, without any improvement efforts such soil will become worse. Intercropping cassava with Brachiaria decumbens (BD) which adapts to acid soil and tolerates low fertility soils {{as well as}} application of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and organic matters are among the important efforts to rehabilitate this soil. The experiment was conducted to {{examine the impact of}} BD, AM, and potassium (K) enriched rice straw compost on exchangeable Al, available K, and stability of soil aggregates. Experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design with three factors and three replications. The first factor was BD as cassava intercropping, the second factor <b>was</b> <b>AM,</b> and the third factor was 2 t ha- 1 rice straw compost enriched with 0 kg, 50 kg, 100 kg, and 200 kg KCl ha- 1. Brick pots (1 m length x 1 m width x 0. 45 m depth) filled with Kanhapludult soil was used for growing cassava in which row of BD was planted at 60 cm from cassava stem. K-enriched rice straw compost and AM (10 g per stem) were applied around cassava stem at 2 and 12 days after planting, respectively. BD was cut every 30 days and the cutting was returned to the soil. Soil exchangeable Al was analyzed at 0, 3, 6 and 9 months after planting (MAP), while Al and K contents as well as aggregate stability were measured at 6 MAP. The results showed that planting BD decreased 33 % exchangeable Al, which means that the root exudates of this grass <b>was</b> <b>effective</b> in detoxifying Al 3 +. Treatment of BD and/or in combination with <b>AM</b> <b>was</b> <b>effective</b> in preserving K added to the soil, increasing total polysaccharides, and improving soil aggregate stability.

40|$|Urocortin 1 (UCN) and adrenomedullin (<b>AM)</b> <b>are</b> two neuropeptides {{that have}} emerged as {{potential}} endogenous anti-inflammatory factors based on their production by and binding to immune cells. Because human septic shock involves excessive inflammatory cytokine production, we investigated the effect of UCN and AM {{in the production of}} inflammatory mediators and their therapeutic actions in two models of septic shock. Both peptides down-regulated the production of inflammatory mediators by endotoxin-activated macrophages. The administration of UCN or AM protected against lethality after cecal ligation and puncture or after injection of bacterial endotoxin and prevented septic shock-associated histopathology, such as infiltration of inflammatory cells and intravascularly disseminated coagulation in various target organs. The therapeutic effect of UCN and <b>AM</b> <b>was</b> mediated by decreasing the local and systemic levels of a wide spectrum of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, and the acute phase protein serum amyloid A.

It has recently been demonstrated that all-trans retinoic acid can suppress Th 17 differentiation and promote the generation of Foxp 3 + regulatory T cells via retinoic acid receptor signals. Here, we investigated the effects of AM 80, a synthetic retinoid with enhanced biological properties to all-trans retinoic acid, on Th 17 differentiation and function and evaluated its therapeutic potential in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis. <b>AM</b> 80 treatment <b>was</b> more <b>effective</b> than all-trans retinoic acid in inhibiting Th 17 differentiation in vitro. Oral administration of <b>AM</b> 80 <b>was</b> protective for the early development of EAE and the down-modulation of Th 17 differentiation and effector functions in vivo. Moreover, AM 80 inhibited interleukin- 17 production by splenic memory T cells, in vitro-differentiated Th 17 cells, and central nervous system-infiltrating effector T cells. Accordingly, <b>AM</b> 80 <b>was</b> <b>effective</b> when administered therapeutically after the onset of EAE. Continuous AM 80 treatment, however, was ineffective at inhibiting late EAE symptoms despite the maintained suppression of RORγt and interleukin- 17 expression levels by central nervous system-infiltrating T cells. We reveal that continuous AM 80 treatment also led to the suppression of interleukin- 10 production by a distinct T cell subset that expressed both Foxp 3 and RORγt.

The present study {{has been designed to}} investigate the anticonvulsant potential of chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of leaves of AM against pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and maximal electroshock (MES) induced convulsions. All the three extracts were administered (i. e. 100, 200, 400 mg/kg, p. o.) for 7 days {{and at the end of}} the treatment convulsions were induced experimentally. Diazepam and phenytoin (1 mg/kg, i. p. and 25 mg/kg, i. p., respectively) were used as reference anticonvulsant drugs against experimentally induced convulsions. High doses (400 mg/kg, p. o.) of chloroform and ethyl acetate extracts both significantly decreased the extent of MES- and PTZ-induced convulsions. On the other hand, ethyl acetate extract at lowest and medium selected doses (i. e. 100 mg/kg, p. o. and 200 mg/kg, p. o., respectively, for 7 days) had also significantly attenuated PTZ-induced convulsions. However, methanol extract at any of the doses used (i. e. 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg, p. o.) did not show any significant effect on PTZ- and MES-induced convulsions.

PU- 35 and Triticum aestivum L. var. WH- 147) and seedlings of two multi purpose tree species (Eucalyptus tereticornis Sm. [Clone C- 7, ITC, Bhadrachalam] and Albizia procera Benth.). Significant increase in plant growth parameters and phosphorus (P) uptake was recorded after inoculations with AM fungi (Acaulospora scrobiculata Trappe, Glomus cerebriforme McGee and G. intraradix Schenck & Smith). Different <b>AM</b> fungi <b>were</b> <b>effective</b> in terms of plant growth and P uptake at different soil moisture levels with most of them having maximum efficacy at FC. Maximum AM activity in terms of arbuscules, vesicles, sporocarp formation, colonization index and spore count per 100 g soil was also recorded at FC in studied plants. While ranking the importance of two factors studied viz., soil moisture levels and inoculation with AM fungi for their effect on the growth of crop / trees, inoculations with AM fungi ranked first (explaining 33 to 86 % variation in plant growth) for P. mungo, T. aestivum and A. procera (forward selection method), whereas soil moisture levels dominantly explained the growth variation in E. tereticornis, except few cases.

The disease has been controlled for over 40  years through the deployment of cultivars with durable resistance derived from the line NDB 112. Pathotypes of C. sativus with virulence for the NDB 112 resistance have been detected in Canada; thus, many commercial cultivars are vulnerable to spot blotch epidemics. To increase the diversity of spot blotch resistance in cultivated barley, we evaluated 318 diverse wild barley accessions comprising the Wild Barley Diversity Collection (WBDC) for reaction to C. sativus at the seedling stage and utilized an association mapping (AM) approach to identify and map resistance loci. A high frequency of resistance {{was found in the}} WBDC as 95 % (302 / 318) of the accessions exhibited low infection responses. The WBDC was genotyped with 558 Diversity Array Technology (DArT®) and 2, 878 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and subjected to structure analysis before running the AM procedure. Thirteen QTL for spot blotch resistance were identified with DArT and SNP markers. These QTL were found on chromosomes 1 H, 2 H, 3 H, 5 H, and 7 H and explained from 2. 3 to 3. 9 % of the phenotypic variance. Nearly half of the identified QTL mapped to chromosome bins where spot blotch resistance loci were previously reported, offering some validation for the AM approach.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to explore the effects of AM and to assess if insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) could protect retinal neuronal cells from AM-induced apoptosis, and to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects. Accordingly, the phosphorylation/activation of Akt and FoxO 3 a were analyzed by Western blot while the possible pathways involved in the protection of IGF- 1 were investigated by application of various pathway inhibitors. The full electroretinogram (FERG) was used to evaluate in vivo effect of AM and IGF- 1 on rat retinal physiological functions. Our results showed that AM concentration dependently caused an apoptosis of RGC- 5 cells, while IGF- 1 protected RGC- 5 cells against this effect by AM. The protective effect of IGF- 1 was reversed by PI 3 K inhibitors LY 294002 and wortmannin as well as the Akt inhibitor VIII. AM decreased p-Akt and p-FoxO 3 a while increased the nuclear localization of FoxO 3 a in the RGC- 5 cells. IGF- 1 reversed the effect of AM on the p-Akt and p-FoxO 3 a and the nuclear translocation of FoxO 3 a. Similar results were obtained in primary cultured retinal ganglia cells. Furthermore, FERG in vivo recording in rats showed that AM decreased a-wave and b-wave of FERG while IGF- 1 reversed the effects of AM. These data show that AM induced apoptosis of retinal neuronal cells via inhibiting the PI 3 K/Akt/FoxO 3 a pathway while IGF- 1 protected RGC- 5 cells against AM-induced cell apoptosis by stimulating this pathway...|$|R

40|$|Study Type - Therapy (case series) Level of Evidence  4 What's {{known on}} the subject? and What does the study add? The {{interest}} in metastatic {{renal cell carcinoma}} has increased {{in the last few}} years, mainly due to the advent of targeted therapies, but metastasectomy remains the sole therapy that can lead to a complete and durable regression, even if only in a minority of patients. The literature reports quite large series of metastasectomies for the most common sites of metastasis, e. g. lung, liver, bone, adrenal and brain, whereas {{little is known about the}} management of metastasis in 'atypical' sites. The prognosis of patients submitted to metastasectomy for a metastasis in an atypical site is equivalent to patients with lung metastasis. The characteristics of the primary tumour in these patients are not indicative, but atypical metastasis (<b>AM)</b> <b>are</b> often located in superficial sites and frequently associated with other metastases. So, physical examination should be included in all follow-up regimens and a complete re-staging should be performed after the diagnosis of an AM. OBJECTIVE: •  To review the clinical characteristics and oncological results in patients submitted to surgical removal of metastasis from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in atypical sites (atypical metastasis [AM], i. e. metastasis in sites other than the chest, liver, bone, adrenal, brain, kidney, and lymph nodes), compared with patients submitted to metastasectomy due to a lung metastasis (LM). PATIENTS AND METHODS: •  From an institutional database of ≈ 1800 patients surgically treated for a RCC, we retrospectively identified 37 cases that had undergone metastasectomy for AM and 57 operated for LM. •  Clinicopathological features of the primary RCC and metastasis, and cancer-specific survival (CSS) computed from the time of metastasectomy of patients with <b>AM</b> and LM, <b>were</b> compared. •  A univariate and multivariable analysis applying a Cox regression model was used to evaluate CSS. RESULTS: •  The patients with <b>AM</b> and LM <b>were</b> followed for an average of 40. 8 and 50. 7 months from metastasectomy, respectively (P= 0. 372). •  There were no significant differences in the characteristics of the primary tumour between patients with AM and LM. •  In the cases with AM and LM the diagnosis was simultaneous with that of the primary tumour in 32. 4 % and 24. 6 %, (P= 0. 40) respectively, and, when metachronous, occurred at an average delay of 53. 4 and 44. 3 months (P= 0. 370). •  More frequently in the cases with AM other metastases had been diagnosed in the previous medical history (35. 2 vs 8. 8 %, P= 0. 001) or simultaneously (48. 6 vs 8. 8 %, P= 0. 001). •  CSS from metastasectomy was affected by the synchronicity in diagnosis between metastasis and primary tumour, and by the simultaneous presence of other metastases, while the type of metastasis (AM vs LM) did not affect CSS. In fact, metastasectomy in <b>AM</b> <b>was</b> as <b>effective</b> as in LM. CONCLUSION: •  <b>AM</b> <b>are</b> an exceptional presentation of metastatic RCC, but the role of surgery is similar to that of pulmonary metastasis. In these cases, metastasectomy is accepted as possible care, and in AM the CSS after metastasectomy is similar...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Let R be a {{noetherian}} ring, a {{an ideal}} of R, and M an R–module. We prove {{that for a}} finite module M, if H i <b>a(M)</b> <b>is</b> minimax for all i ≥ r ≥ 1, then H i <b>a(M)</b> <b>is</b> artinian for i ≥ r. A Local-global Principle for minimax local cohomology modules is shown. If H i <b>a(M)</b> <b>is</b> coatomic for i ≤ r (M finite) then H i <b>a(M)</b> <b>is</b> finite for i ≤ r. We give conditions for a module, which is locally minimax to be a minimax module. A non-vanishing theorem and some vanishing theorems are proved for local cohomology modules. 1...|$|R
