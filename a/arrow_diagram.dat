40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of three management and planning quality control tools – affinity diagram, <b>arrow</b> <b>diagram</b> and process decision program chart – was performed. Then fuzzy logic was used for increase the yield of information of these tools. All three tools shown up to be flexible for fuzzy approach application. As the first, an application of an <b>arrow</b> <b>diagram</b> with a support of fuzzy logic to solution of mobile phone functionality problem at a service center for repair of mobile phones is presented. For the smooth course of negotiation between a client and the mobile phone reparation service {{there is a need}} to estimate the time of the problem solution as precisely as possible. Fuzzy logic as a supporter for an <b>arrow</b> <b>diagram</b> was used in order to determine the time interval of mobile reparation process more accurately in comparison with a standard approach. Better estimation of the time of a step “Diagnostics with the goal to find a cause of a problem” using the fuzzy logic is demonstrated. Then, an affinity diagram formed for a process of adhesive assembly of electronic components on the printed circuit board was constructed. Fuzzy approach showed the degree of an influence of the failures in some operations of the process to the failures in the following operations of this process. Non-obvious failures that could be met during a testing step were estimated and their significance was calculated. Process decision program chart (PDPC) created for assembly of electronic components on a printed circuit board based on wave soldering was also presented. The process decision program chart was constructed to identify risks and develop counter-measures (preventive actions). Volume of information, which should be involved into such the diagram, is very high. Fuzzy approach was used to find information of lower importance, which can occur, and thereby reduce the amount of entering information for processing of the PDPC diagram. The use of fuzzy logic is, with respect to the range of the thesis, documented on selected steps used in the processing of selected managerial quality control tools. The approach is generic and can be used for any technological or other type of an operation or a process to obtain deeper insight into the problem and better estimation of the course of an event under analysis.

From the {{viewpoint}} of project management, {{it is essential to}} qualitatively analyze the risks and conduct the risk management. However, in reality, the data for the analysis is usually very limited in the countries and areas in Eastern Asia. The aim of the present study is to conduct quantitative risk analysis based on real data in road projects in Japan and discuss the risk management. Based on the obtained data, the frequency and the impact of each event are analyzed and summarized in a risk ranking matrix. In addition, <b>arrow</b> <b>diagrams</b> are built to represent the sequence of project steps.

An appropriate framework is necessary for such kind of the analysis. The main problem of modern modelling object-oriented techniques, which are easy in use and comprehension, (e. g.

40|$|Abstract. Arrows {{are major}} {{components}} of diagrams, {{where they are}} typically used to facilitate the communication of spatial and temporal knowledge. An automated interpretation of arrow diagrams would be highly desirable in pen-based interfaces. This paper develops a method for deducing possible interpretations of arrow diagrams, which is composed of a uni-directional arrow symbol and one or more components. Based on {{a study of the}} use of arrow diagrams, we classify their semantics into properties, annotations, actions, and conjunctions. Then, we discuss the structural requirements of arrow diagrams for illustrating each class of semantics, as well as the structural rules for adding optional components. Finally, we investigate all possible structures of simple arrow diagrams for each class of semantics and demonstrate that knowledge about the structure of an <b>arrow</b> <b>diagram</b> reduces the ambiguity of its interpretation. ...|$|E
40|$|Causal mapping is a {{tool that}} enables you {{to make sense of}} {{challenging}} situations so that you can get more out of them. A causal map is a word and <b>arrow</b> <b>diagram</b> in which ideas and actions are causally linked with one another through the use of arrows. Typically, only specialists such as physical or social scientists and operations researchers know about causal mapping and the tool is therefore not widely known or its broad applicability understood. Until now there has been no guidance available on how {{to make use of the}} tool for more general purposes. This book lets managers understand the theory and practice of causal mapping in layman's terms for use in both individual and group settings. It shows managers how to develop and use action-oriented strategy maps and logic models in business decision making. The authors show how causal mapping can be used as a tool to make sense of challenging situations and develop effective business responses...|$|E

In this context we introduce Gauss diagrams counterparts to chord diagrams, 4 T relation and weight systems arising from Lie algebras.

An algebra of acyclic arrow graphs is also introduced and its isomorphism to the algebra ~ Am of <b>arrow</b> <b>diagrams</b> is veried.

Quantum Grav. 32, 175007 (2015), and we will advance our programme in accordance with the road map recently given in arXiv: 1611. 04424 v 2.

40|$|One of {{the goals}} of systems biology is to reverse {{engineer}} in a comprehensive fashion the arrow diagrams of signal transduction systems. An important tool for ordering pathway components is genetic epistasis analysis, and here we present a strategy termed Alternative Inputs (AIs) to perform systematic epistasis analysis. An alternative input is defined as any genetic manipulation that can activate the signaling pathway instead of the natural input. We introduced the concept of an "AIs-Deletions matrix" that summarizes the outputs of all combinations of alternative inputs and deletions. We developed the theory and algorithms to construct a pairwise relationship graph from the AIs-Deletions matrix capturing both functional ordering (upstream, downstream) and logical relationships (AND, OR), and then interpreting these relationships into a standard <b>arrow</b> <b>diagram.</b> As a proof-of-principle, we applied this methodology to a subset of genes involved in yeast mating signaling. This experimental pilot study highlights the robustness of the approach and important technical challenges. In summary, this research formalizes and extends classical epistasis analysis from linear pathways to more complex networks, facilitating computational analysis and reconstruction of signaling arrow diagrams...|$|E

Thus the problem necessarily contains aspects of both cognitive and formal cognitive and formal logic. A key point in the CMD-problems is that the universe to be specified is not an example from a textbook but a piece of reality like a bank or an airport. In addition, the specification has to be somehow extracted from multiple, very informal and often hardly consistent descriptions provided by different people. Moreover, as the process of information system design is going on, and mutual understanding between the contributors is increasing, these partial descriptions may be changed so that the entire specification is permanently revised and corrected. On a whole, the design process goes along something like a spiral rather than a direct line, and thus the conceptual model is endlessly reengineered until the approaching deadline captures it as it is. So, a conceptual model has to compress a bulky array of diverse information into a compact comprehensible specification suitable for effective communication between the database designers...|$|E

Sequence diagram editors have more functionality than simple box and <b>arrow</b> <b>diagram</b> editors. This is because we are dealing with a language. A language with syntactical and semantical constraints and rules. To have a fully functional editor for a language it should support these constraints and rules. To add an extra level of complexity the constraints and rules for sequence diagram are in two dimensions. This means the placement of elements have significance both in the vertical and the horizontal direction. The thesis shows that it is possible, with limited resources, to develop a sequence diagram editor supporting the new UML 2. 0 specification. The thesis will also show a systematic approach to defining editing behavior in a sequence diagram editor. The editor was also used to look at the possibility of integration with other tools.

The following results are obtained. • The mod 2 reduction of ϑ is incomplete, which answers a question of Sarkaria. • An odd-dimensional analogue of ϑ is a complete obstruction to linkless embeddability (=“intrinsic unlinking”) of the given n-polyhedron in R 2 n+ 1. • A “blown up ” 1 -parameter version of ϑ is a universal type 1 invariant of singular knots, i. e. knots in R 3 with {{a finite number of}} rigid transverse double points.

One technique to produce this master model is using Roland MDX 40 machine which is already used in ADTC. However, duplicating master model by using this machine is not recommended because : (1) Producing a master model using a Roland MDX 40 machine consumes a long time (depend on product complexity) due to metal material used for producing the master model is a heat resistant material, hence requires more time to shape; (2) Roland MDX 40 machine are high costly to use. The time consumption {{in the process of}} making the master model would burden the cost of electricity and replacing the cutter all the time when it is not sharp anymore; (3) A Roland MDX 40 machine also requires a machine operator to always stand by to frequently giving the machine and cutter oil lubricant during the process.

40|$|Two new {{techniques}} for analyzing retinotopic maps— arrow diagrams and visual field sign maps—are demonstrated {{with a large}} electrophysiological mapping data set from owl monkey extrastriate visual cortex. An <b>arrow</b> <b>diagram</b> (vectors indicating receptive field centers placed at cortical coordinates) provides a more compact and understandable representation of retinotopy than does a standard receptive field chart (accompanied by a penetration map) or a double contour map (e. g., isoeccentricity and isopolar angle {{as a function of}} cortical x, y-coordinates). None of these three representational techniques, however, make separate areas easily visible, especially in data sets containing numerous areas with partial, distorted representations of the visual hemrfield. Therefore, we computed visual field sign maps (non-mirror-image vs mirror-image visual field representation) from the angle between the direction of the cortical gradient in receptive field eccentricity and the cortical gradient in receptive field angle for each small region of the cortex. Visual field sign is a local measure invariant to cortical map orientation and distortion but also to choice of receptive field coordinate system. To estimate the gradients, we first interpolated the eccentricity and polar angle data onto regular grids using a distance-weighted smoothing algorithm. The visual field sign technique provides a more objective method for using retinotopy to outline multiple visual areas. In order to relate these arrow and visual field sign maps accurately to architectonic features visualized in the stained, flattened cortex, we also developed a deformable template algorithm for warping the photograph-derived penetration map using the final observed location of a set of marking lesions...|$|E
