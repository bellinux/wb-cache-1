According to Forman: [...] "This great actor, who had tremendous artistic intuition, completely mistrusted his talent. I think this was because he had a very rationalist disposition and could never see, much less measure, the result of his acting. 'Was it good, Mr. Forman?” he asked me after every perfect shot.

Interviewed in 2005 about the shootdown, Tracy stated, [...] "Jim (Wang) <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> at first were held up as scapegoats. I think that was to cover up for the pilots.

500|$|The show, {{as well as}} a {{majority}} of UPN's programs, was officially canceled when the network merged with The WB Television Network (The WB) to form The CW in 2006. Fern Gillespie of The Crisis was critical of UPN's decision to cancel the series given how the network [...] "in one swoop, wiped out five of its eight African American comedies" [...] with the creation of The CW. Gillespie expressed disappointment at the lack of African American sitcoms on the three major networks, saying: [...] "Without that opportunity for some of the younger artists to hone and develop their skills, it will potentially have a generational impact." [...] IndieWire's Dara T. Mathis identified Eve as an example of UPN's notable black sitcoms and equated the cancellations of {{a majority}} of UPN's comedies as a sign that the genre {{was in a state of}} decline. Critic Tim Goodman noted that Eve was one of six shows [...] "geared for an African American audience", featuring [...] "an African American lead actress" [...] that were canceled during the merger. He viewed these cancellations as a sign of networks [...] "eliminat niche programming". Julian Kimble of Complex included Eve on a list of programs that [...] "are often forgotten about", alongside other UPN sitcoms Half & Half <b>and</b> <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>Us.</b> The series has not been made available on Blu-ray or DVD, but it was released on the iTunes Store and Amazon Video.|$|E

After his death, Rutherford's burial {{was delayed}} {{for three and a half}} months due to legal {{proceedings}} arising from his desire to be buried at Beth Sarim, which he had previously expressed to three close advisers from Brooklyn headquarters. Watchtower attorney Hayden C.

2500|$|One of Reed's sore points {{resulting}} from that unauthorized re-editing {{was that the}} [...] "heavenly wine and roses" [...] melody was cut out of [...] "Sweet Jane". In the original recording, this part was intended to provide a perfectly flowing bridge to a full-fledged plagal cadence two-chord version of the chorus (earlier choruses in the song have a 4-chord riff). In Reed's initial solo performances, he would include the verse (see for instance American Poet), until 1973, when he would routinely leave it out, as the bridge fits less well in a more hard rock version (as heard for instance on Rock 'n' Roll Animal). However, the post-Reed, Doug Yule-led Velvets always performed the song with the verse included. A career-spanning retrospective of Reed's recordings with the Velvet Underground and as a solo artist, NYC Man (The Ultimate Collection 1967–2003), which Reed compiled himself, uses the shorter version. When asked about the shortened versions of [...] "Sweet Jane" [...] and [...] "New Age" [...] and Reed's long-standing claims that they were re-edited without his consent, Yule claimed that Reed had in fact edited the songs himself. [...] "He edited it. You have to understand at the time, the motivation was... Lou was, <b>and</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> were, intent on one thing {{and that was to}} be successful and what you had to do to be successful in music, was you had to have a hit, and a hit had to be uptempo, short, and with no digressions, straight ahead basically, you wanted a hook and something to feed the hook and that was it. 'Sweet Jane' was arranged just exactly the way it is on the original Loaded release exactly for that reason—to be a hit! 'Who Loves The Sun' was done exactly that way for that reason—to be a hit." ...|$|E
