5|$|Palmer and Buckner {{both had}} {{developed}} reputations as independent executives {{while serving as}} governors of their respective states. Because they had served on opposite sides during the Civil War, their presence on the same ticket emphasized national unity. The ticket was endorsed by several major newspapers including the Chicago Chronicle, Louisville Courier-Journal, Detroit Free Press, Richmond Times, and New Orleans Picayune. Despite these advantages, the ticket was hurt by the candidates' ages, Palmer being 79and Buckner 73. Further, some supporters feared that voting for the National Democrat ticket would be a wasted vote <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> throw the election to Bryan. Ultimately, Palmer and Buckner received just over {{one percent of the}} vote in the election.|$|E
5|$|Tarbosaurus and Alioramus shared several skull features, {{including}} a locking mechanism {{in the lower}} jaw between the dentary and angular bones, and both lacked the prong of the nasal bones which connected to the lacrimal bones in all other tyrannosaurids except adult Daspletosaurus. The two genera may be closely related, representing an Asian branch of the Tyrannosauridae. Some specimens of Tarbosaurus have a row of bumps on the nasal bones like those of Alioramus, although much lower. The long and low shape of the only known Alioramus remotus skull indicated that it was immature when it died <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> have been a juvenile Tarbosaurus, which {{lived in the same}} time and place. The more prominent nasal crests and much higher tooth count of Alioramus, however, suggested it was a separate taxon, even if it is known only from juvenile remains, confirmed by the discovery of A. altai. Specimens identified as immature Tarbosaurus have the same tooth count as adults.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} was {{made worse by}} the fact that Icesave was operating as a branch of Landsbanki, rather than as a legally independent subsidiary. As such, it was completely dependent on the Central Bank of Iceland for emergency loans of liquidity, and could not turn to the Bank of England for help. The UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) was aware of the risk, and was considering imposing special liquidity requirements on Icelandic deposit-taking banks in the weeks before the crisis. However the plan – which was never implemented – would have forced the Icelandic banks to cut interest rates or stop taking new deposits, <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> have sparked the sort of bank run it was designed to prevent. The Guernsey authorities were also planning on bringing in restrictions on foreign banks operating as branches and on transfers of funds between Guernsey subsidiaries and parent banks ("parental upstreaming"). Landsbanki operated in Guernsey through a legally independent subsidiary.|$|E

Massa got the third place, with 21% of the vote, and both candidates sought to secure the voters that had voted for him. Both candidates were polarized on the opinion about the presidency of Cristina Kirchner: Scioli proposes to keep most of the Kirchnerite policies, and Macri to change them. In the legislative elections, the FPV lost the majority of the chamber of deputies, but keeps the majority of the senate.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{controversy}} concerning the capital, and public dissatisfaction of economic development, Uri party lost much of its popularity. When the Uri party was defeated in by-elections held on 30 April 2005, losing every one of the 23 electoral districts, Uri Party lost its majority in the National Assembly. Facing the outcome of his unpopularity, Roh took a rather strange measure to manage the government when he proposed a grand coalition with the opposition Grand National Party. Roh's rationale was that since it was impossible to continue his presidency with an approval rate of around 20 percent, a grand coalition comprising the Uri party and the Grand National Party was desirable, and that the difference between both parties in terms of political agendas was actually minute. Roh promised he would yield much of his power <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> resign from office if a grand coalition was successfully launched.|$|E

25|$|On 16 June at 10:00 am, MacDonald's vanguard arrived near Piacenza {{and began}} {{pressing}} Ott's command. Suvorov reiterated his orders for Ott {{to make a}} fighting retreat to the Stradella defile. By this time Austrian military engineer Albert Johann de Best got the Piacenza citadel into a defensible state after eight days of work; two or three companies of the Fröhlich Regiment were assigned to garrison it. Victor's division led the French attack on Ott as Rusca's soldiers edged toward the south as if to flank the Austrians out of position. That night, Suvorov's chief of staff Johann Gabriel Chasteler de Courcelles rushed toward Ott's position with 100 dragoons of the Karaczay Regiment plus a half-battery of horse artillery. Following behind was an improvised force including the Wouwermanns Grenadier Battalion, three battalions of the Fröhlich Regiment, {{the remainder of the}} Karaczay Regiment and one and one-half batteries of horse artillery. If Ott could hold out along the Tidone River, it would allow ample space for the Austro-Russian army to deploy between the Po and the mountain spurs to the south. If Ott were forced back into the narrow Stradella position, {{it would be difficult for}} the Allies to form a line of battle <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> cause a rout.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} other {{characteristics}} of B.prionotes {{can be understood as}} secondary responses to weak serotiny. For example, winter flowering ensures that seed is ripe {{by the beginning of the}} bushfire season; this is very important for weakly serotinous species, which rely heavily upon the current year's seed crop. Another example is the deciduous florets of B.prionotes. In strongly serotinous species, the old florets are retained on the cones, where they function as fire fuel, helping to ensure that follicles reach temperatures sufficient to trigger seed release. In B.prionotes, however, seed release is triggered at relatively low temperatures: in one study, 50% of follicles opened at , and 90% opened at in contrast, the closely related but strongly serotinous B. hookeriana required [...] respectively. Floret retention would therefore be to no advantage, <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> prevent seed from escaping spontaneously opened follicles.|$|E

500|$|The {{central theme}} {{in almost all}} {{renditions}} of the narrative favouring the Mortara family was that of Marianna Mortara's health. From July 1858 onwards it was reported across Europe {{that as a result}} of her grief, Edgardo's mother had practically if not actually gone insane, <b>and</b> <b>might</b> <b>even</b> die. The powerful image of the heartbroken mother was stressed heavily in the family's appeals both to the public and to Edgardo himself. Momolo and the secretary of Rome's Jewish community, Sabatino Scazzocchio, told Edgardo that his mother's life was at risk if he did not come back soon. When Marianna wrote to her son in August, Scazzocchio refused to deliver the letter on the grounds that, being relatively calm and reassuring in tone, it might work against the impression they were trying to give him that she was no longer herself and that only his return could save her. One correspondent reported in January 1859: [...] "The father shows a great deal of courage, but the mother is having a hard time carrying on.... If the Holy Father had seen this woman as I saw her, he would not have the courage to keep her son another moment." ...|$|E
