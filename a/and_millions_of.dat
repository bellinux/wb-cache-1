It was {{settled out of court}} by her lawyers in June 2013 who said that they had cancelled because GateFive had lost its financial backers. Beyoncé also has had deals with American Express, Nintendo DS and L'Oréal since the age of 18.|$|E

5|$|By July 1940 the {{situation}} had improved somewhat with uniforms, a modicum of training {{and the arrival of}} hundreds of thousands of rifles <b>and</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> rounds of ammunition from the USA. New weapons were developed that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that were needed to produce armaments for the regular units. An early example was the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade (a glass bottle filled with highly flammable material of which more than six million were made), and the No. 73 Grenade (an anti-tank grenade resembling a Thermos flask).|$|E
5|$|The SS was the {{organization}} {{most responsible for}} the genocidal killing of an estimated 5.5 to 6 million Jews <b>and</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> other victims in the Holocaust. Members of all of its branches committed war crimes and crimes against humanity during World War II (1939–45). The SS was also involved in commercial enterprises and exploited concentration camp inmates as slave labor. After Nazi Germany's defeat, the SS and the NSDAP were judged by the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg to be criminal organizations. Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the highest-ranking surviving SS main department chief, {{was found guilty of}} crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg trials and hanged in 1946.|$|E
5|$|Under Hitler's {{leadership}} and racially motivated ideology, the Nazi regime {{was responsible for}} the genocide of at least 5.5 million Jews <b>and</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> other victims whom he and his followers deemed Untermenschen (sub-humans) or socially undesirable. Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19.3 million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 29 million soldiers and civilians {{died as a result of}} military action in the European theatre of World War II. The number of civilians killed during the Second World War was unprecedented in warfare and the casualties constituted the deadliest conflict in human history.|$|E

5|$|Germany's {{foreign policy}} {{during the war}} {{involved}} the creation of allied governments under direct or indirect control from Berlin. A main goal was obtaining soldiers from the senior allies such as Italy and Hungary <b>and</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> workers and ample food supplies from subservient allies such as Vichy France. By the fall of 1942, there were 24 divisions from Romania on the Eastern Front, 10 from Italy and 10 from Hungary. When a country was no longer dependable, Germany assumed full control as it did with France in 1942, Italy in 1943 and Hungary in 1944. Although Japan was an official powerful ally, the relationship was distant and there was little co-ordination or co-operation. For example, Germany refused to share their formula for synthetic oil from coal {{until late in the}} war.|$|E
5|$|LCA is {{used for}} example in the {{building}} sector. Buildings today account for the 40% of the world’s energy use. The resulting carbon emissions are substantially {{higher than those of}} the transportation sector. New buildings using more energy than necessary are being built every day, <b>and</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> today's inefficient buildings will remain standing until at least 2050. It’s therefore necessary to start reducing energy use in new and existing buildings {{in order to reduce the}} planet's energy-related carbon footprint. Growing interest, space, and attention in the architecture sector are directed to environmental issues according to the principles of green building. Mineral, vegetable, or animal materials such as perlite, vermiculite, rock wool, glass wool, cork, plant fibers (cotton, flax, hemp, coconut), wood fiber, cellulose, and sheep's wool can be used for the production of insulation panels.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Rose deduces {{that she}} and Mickey were kept alive because their touch can {{activate}} the Genesis Ark. Dalek Sec explains that they cannot open the Ark because it is stolen Time Lord technology. He demands that Rose open it, but she refuses and mocks the Daleks until the Doctor arrives. The Doctor realises that these Daleks are the enigmatic Cult of Skaro, and uses his sonic screwdriver to allow the Cybermen into the sphere chamber. As the Cybermen attack the Daleks, Mickey accidentally activates the Ark while escaping. The Daleks battle the Cybermen and Dalek Sec takes the Ark outside. The Doctor and his companions flee into the tower. Along the way, Pete saves Jackie from the Cybermen and the two embrace. The Doctor then takes everyone to the control room where they witness the Genesis Ark open <b>and</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> Daleks that were imprisoned during the Time War pour out and begin engaging the Cybermen firing on them from below, though humanity is {{caught in the crossfire}} and many are killed while running for cover.|$|E

5|$|The Allies {{called for}} {{unconditional}} Japanese surrender in the Potsdam Declaration of 27 July, but the Japanese government rejected the call. In early August, the USAAF dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Allies justified the atomic bombings {{as a military}} necessity to avoid invading the Japanese home islands which would cost the lives of between 250,000 and 500,000 Allied servicemen <b>and</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> Japanese troops and civilians. Between the two bombings, the Soviets, pursuant to the Yalta agreement, invaded Japanese-held Manchuria, and quickly defeated the Kwantung Army, which was the largest Japanese fighting force. The Red Army also captured Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands. On 15 August 1945, Japan surrendered, with the surrender documents finally signed at Tokyo Bay {{on the deck of}} the American battleship USS Missouri on 2 September 1945, ending the war.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish conquest {{stripped}} away {{most of the}} defining features of Maya civilization. However, many Maya villages remained remote from Spanish colonial authority, {{and for the most}} part continued to manage their own affairs. Maya communities and the nuclear family maintained their traditional day-to-day life. The basic Mesoamerican diet of maize and beans continued, although agricultural output was improved by the introduction of steel tools. Traditional crafts such as weaving, ceramics, and basketry continued to be practised. Community markets and trade in local products continued long after the conquest. At times, the colonial administration encouraged the traditional economy in order to extract tribute in the form of ceramics or cotton textiles, although these were usually made to European specifications. Maya beliefs and language proved resistant to change, despite vigorous efforts by Catholic missionaries. The 260-day tzolk'in ritual calendar continues in use in modern Maya communities in the highlands of Guatemala and Chiapas, <b>and</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> Mayan-language speakers inhabit the territory in which their ancestors developed their civilization.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Floyd in New York {{included}} two deaths <b>and</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> dollars in damage. Hurricane Floyd, once {{a large and}} powerful Category 4 hurricane, made landfall in North Carolina and moved northward along the East Coast, making landfall on Long Island as a tropical storm. The threat of the hurricane prompted schools in New York City to close {{for the first time}} since 1996, and 20 shelters were opened. Floyd produced flooding rainfall and gusty winds throughout the state, from the southern Hudson Valley to the Lake Champlain area. The flood waters damaged multiple roads and forced residents to evacuate from certain locations. Strong winds left as many as 100,000 people without power and brought down a high number of trees due to the saturated ground. In the aftermath of the storm, 15 counties in eastern New York were declared eligible for state or federal assistance.|$|E
5|$|Wind gusts {{in central}} Maryland peaked at 83mph (134km/h) in Silver Spring, with a {{location}} along the Patuxent River recording sustained winds of 55mph (88km/h). Unofficially, rainfall reached 7inches (178mm) in portions of Maryland, though the highest precipitation amount totaled 3.21inches (82mm) at the Baltimore-Washington International Airport. Swells from the hurricane produced high storm surges along the Western Shore which peaked at 8.2feet (2.5m) in Baltimore. Annapolis also reported {{a surge of}} 7.2feet (2.2m). In many locations, the storm surge was higher than the previous record set by the 1933 Chesapeake Potomac Hurricane. Throughout central Maryland, 472buildings and homes were destroyed, with 3,260 greatly damaged and another 3,600 affected in general. Strong storm surge from the hurricane washed 43,000tons (39,000 t) of salt, millions of pounds of nitrogen and phosphorus, <b>and</b> <b>millions</b> <b>of</b> gallons of raw sewage into the Chesapeake Bay. One person {{died as a result}} of a traffic death in the state. Property damage totaled $530.5million (2003USD, ($ USD), with an additional $190,000 (2003USD, ($ USD) in crop damage. The crop damage was primarily limited to minor damage to livestock buildings and sheds, though the winds destroyed a hay barn and a dairy barn at one farm in Frederick County. The United States Department of Agriculture estimated the winds of the hurricane destroyed 15–30% of the field corn and 10–15% of the soybean crop. Excess amounts of water led to the closure of many crab processing plants and crab house restaurants, and officials restricted harvest on shellfish for eleven days due to unsafe impurities in the water.|$|E
