50|$|In aviation, {{pushback}} is an <b>airport</b> <b>procedure</b> {{during which}} an aircraft is pushed backwards {{away from an}} airport gate by external power. Pushbacks are carried out by special, low-profile vehicles called pushback tractors or tugs.|$|E
50|$|In {{accordance}} with Section 14a AsylVfG the procedure can vary greatly if it {{falls under the}} so-called <b>airport</b> <b>procedure</b> (Flughafenverfahren), an altered jurisdiction for refugees travelling to Germany by plane and applying for asylum before entering German borders. In short, it states that refugees may be processed within 3 days, and be sent home much quicker if the police can determine that the refugees started their journey in a country previously defined as safe by the German government. The law {{was put in place}} to keep airports from having to house refugees for extended periods of time and potentially becoming overrun while refugees waited for their application for asylum to be processed.|$|E

40|$|In {{air traffic}} management, {{optimization}} is often restricted to local areas, e. g., to {{the vicinity of}} <b>airports.</b> <b>Procedures</b> around these areas stay unchanged, and effects from optimizations concerning ecological efficiency are not considered adequately. Investigating new concepts, this typically results in local gain of efficiency without proving the global benefit. The project World Wide Air Traffic Management (WW-ATM) creates a platform for optimization and validation of world-wide concepts considering feasibility, throughput, costs- and ecological efficiency, and robustness respectively fault liability. Based on different evaluation and optimization tools, complete traffic scenarios can be analyzed and improved both strategically and tactically...|$|R
50|$|A {{high-speed}} rail link between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore was {{proposed in the}} late 1990s, but due to high costs the proposal was shelved. In 2006 YTL Corporation, operator of the Express Rail Link in Kuala Lumpur, revived the proposal, with a projected speed of 250 km/h (155 mph). This was expected to trim travel time between the two cities to 99 minutes, compared with 4-5 hours by road, 7 hours by conventional rail services, or 3 hours by air (including travel {{to and from the}} airports, check-in, boarding and other <b>airport</b> <b>procedures).</b> In 2008 the Malaysian government halted the project citing high-costs of over RM8 billion.|$|R
5000|$|Australia {{used to have}} a {{non-standard}} {{class of}} airspace for use at the capital city general aviation airports, called a General Aviation <b>Airport</b> <b>Procedures</b> Zone (GAAP Zone). A control tower provided procedural clearances for all aircraft inside the zone. Additionally, any aircraft operating within [...] of the zone must obtain a clearance. VFR aircraft arrive and depart using standard arrival and departure routes, while instrument arrival and departure procedures are published for IFR operations. During visual meteorological conditions (VMC), IFR aircraft are not provided with full IFR services. During instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), or marginal VMC, VFR operations are restricted in order to facilitate full IFR service for IFR aircraft.|$|R

One of the Canadian embassy officers spotted the mistake while checking the documents. Fortunately, extra passports had been included, so Mendez was able to insert new visa stamps with dates based on the Iranian calendar. As the weeks passed, the Americans read and played games, mainly cards and Scrabble, while Taylor made efforts to fly out non-essential Canadian embassy personnel. Taylor sent others on fake errands to establish erratic patterns and to case <b>airport</b> <b>procedures.</b> Tension rose as suspicious telephone calls and other activity indicated that their concealment might have been discovered.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This work {{is focused}} on norm {{operationalization}} in aviation domain. The investigated paradigm can be described as: from legal norms to technical rules in the artifact. Normative requirements (norms) for the aircraft trajectories are extracted from the flight rules and <b>airport</b> <b>procedures,</b> and operationalized in a decision support system (DSS). The decision support is based on evaluation of risk to violate the normative requirement. The following risks are modeled: trajectories' conformance with the flight rules, safe distance between aircraft, wake turbulence separation and avoidance of volcanic ash. The DSS is for the air traffic controller (not pilot) and must respond in real time. It provides surveillance, evaluates and recommends, whereas the human controller takes a decision...|$|R

50|$|Backtaxi (also {{known as}} backtrack) is an <b>airport</b> ground <b>procedure</b> which {{involves}} the use of any portion of a runway as a taxiway for an aircraft to taxi in the opposite direction from which it will take off or has landed. The procedure is commonly used at smaller airports and private strips which may not have separate paved taxiways parallel to the runway.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{negative}} association with the term CDA, new procedures introduced at LAX and other US airports are instead called optimized profile descent (OPD). Although CDA procedures were documented at Louisville International <b>Airport,</b> the <b>procedures</b> at high capacity airports, such as Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), require lower altitudes than step down approaches. Not only does this negate the benefits of CDAs, but actually increases noise and pollution.|$|R

The crew then told the controllers on the ETA of Flight 812, and stated their intention to make a right turn within 25 miles from the beacon for a track out on 261 degrees, descending to 1,500 ft followed by a procedure to turn over the water for final approach on Runway 09.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{consider}} modelling {{an airport}} inside a computer. A procedural (e.g. C) programmer would create data structures {{to represent the}} elements of an <b>airport</b> and <b>procedures</b> or routines to operate on those data structures. An object-oriented (e.g. C++) programmer would create objects to represent {{the elements of the}} airport with methods which represent their behaviors. A functional (e.g. Scheme) programmer would create higher-order functions representing both the elements and behaviors of the airport. A metalinguistic programmer would abstract the problem by creating new, embedded domain specific languages for modelling an airport, with peculiar primitives and types for doing so naturalistically. The language could then encompass any or all of the above techniques as required by the problem at hand.|$|R
