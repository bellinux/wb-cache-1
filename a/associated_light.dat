The British forces began to leave port {{on the evening of}} 26 August, beginning with the submarines assigned to the operation. Most of the surface forces went to sea early on the following morning; the 7th Cruiser Squadron, which had been added to provide further support to the Harwich Force, left port later in the day.|$|E

40|$|Hermissenda crassicornis is a shell-less marine snail {{that can}} be classically {{conditioned}} to <b>associate</b> <b>light</b> (the conditioned stimulus) with turbulence (the unconditioned stimulus). Acquisition of the association is critically dependent on elevation of intracellular calcium in the B cell soma, the location of memory storage. The source of calcium elevation has implications for cellular mechanisms underlying memory storage. To investigate sources of calcium elevation, a model of calcium dynamics in the photoreceptor was developed. Mechanisms of calcium diffusion, buffering and light activated release from intracellular stores {{were included in the}} model. Simulations show that release of calcium from intracellular stores is a significant source of calcium in the soma and may be the activating signal for the light-induced potassium current.
