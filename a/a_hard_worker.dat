5|$|I've liked Tommy {{for a long}} time. He's clever, infectious, {{enthusiastic}} and <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>worker.</b> He can play as a centre-forward, behind the centre-forward or out wide, so covers a lot of positions. He's {{going to be a}} great asset to us.|$|E
5|$|The second subplot {{involves}} {{the family of}} Bullhampton's miller, Jacob Brattle. His youngest son, Sam, is <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>worker</b> at the mill, but has fallen in with bad companions, and is often absent from home. Sam's sister Carry is worse off yet: having yielded to a seducer, she has been disowned by her father, and is living a life of sin in an unknown location.|$|E
5|$|Culverhouse was {{diagnosed}} with lung cancer in 1992. After a successful operation to remove a tumor and part of his lung, he began chemotherapy a few months later, when a routine exam revealed a recurrence of the cancer. Despite his health problems, he remained <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>worker</b> until the end, and even went hunting in Tanzania only four days after having part of his lung removed. An experimental procedure failed to stop the cancer, and he died on August 25, 1994, at the Medical Center of Louisiana at New Orleans. He was survived by wife Joy, daughter Gay, and son Hugh, Jr.|$|E

5000|$|Despite being [...] "undersized", Azary was {{routinely}} {{given the}} top defensive assignments against much taller players. He even played against centers {{and used his}} aggressiveness and hustle to outplay them. His head coach, Gordon Ridings, said of Azary, [...] "I never saw <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> <b>worker</b> than John. He once stayed an hour after practice taking foul shots because he had missed two out of ten free throws in the previous night’s game." ...|$|R
5|$|As a child, Marmaduke was academically {{gifted and}} also a keen boxer and long-distance swimmer. He also took a keen {{interest}} in mechanical things, particularly combustion engines, and was building Meccano models of aircraft and other vehicles by the age of 12. In his early teens, he became an avid amateur mechanic, fixing the family motor car and learning to drive. Marmaduke was never <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>worker</b> and did not embark upon an academic career, but was considered to possess above average intelligence. In 1929, he passed the Junior Certificate Exam with first class honours. The certificate qualified him for Victoria Boy's High School from which he graduated in 1931.|$|E
5|$|Hammond was {{involved}} with several businesses. In 1933, to ease his financial concerns, {{he took a job}} with the Cater Motor Company. He was used as a sales promotions manager, which mainly involved publicity and meeting customers, although he also test-drove cars. Taking a job with Marsham Tyres in 1937 enabled him to become an amateur cricketer. He joined the board of directors and was again used for publicity, but he was never <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>worker</b> or determined salesman. Returning to Marsham's after he was discharged from the RAF in 1944, he supplemented his income by working as a journalist. He wrote for The Star during the 1948 Test series and penned three books with the assistance of a ghostwriter.|$|E
5|$|David's {{private life}} was less felicitous. In April 1963 her affair with Higgins {{came to an}} end when he remarried. For a period she drank too much brandy and resorted too often to {{sleeping}} pills. Probably {{as a result of these}} factors and overwork, in 1963, when she was 49, David suffered a cerebral haemorrhage. She kept the news of the event within her close circle of friends—none of the editors of the publications she worked for were aware of the collapse—as she did not want her reputation as <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>worker</b> to be damaged. She recovered, but her confidence was badly shaken and her sense of taste was temporarily affected; for a period she could not taste salt, or the effect salt had on what she was cooking, but her sense of smell of frying onions was so enhanced as to be unpleasant for her.|$|E
50|$|He {{played in}} the Shute Shield {{competition}} with Eastwood, impressing coach John Manenti, who said:Steve Cummins has established himself as <b>a</b> real <b>hard</b> <b>worker</b> with huge involvements at the tackle and breakdown areas.|$|R
50|$|Executives' feedback: The Renuzit {{executives}} {{noted that}} James's and Stefani's team {{worked very well}} complementing each other's strength and weaknesses, while Frank took over while Nicole stayed behind the scenes. They did note that Frank was <b>a</b> very <b>hard</b> <b>worker.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fired: Victoria Gotti - for {{faulting}} on {{the sound}} production and letting her emotions hinder her performance. While Lisa Lampanelli was ultimately responsible for the loss after taking accountability for the concept and was criticized for bringing back Dayana Mendoza instead of Aubrey O'Day (who had made {{a majority of the}} creative decisions), Lisa made a compelling and emotional case as to why she should stay since Victoria had threatened to quit the team and help the men. This, along with Dayana's testimony that Lisa was <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> <b>worker,</b> sealed Victoria's fate.|$|R
5|$|Nixon {{was offered}} a tuition grant to attend Harvard University, but Harold's {{continued}} illness {{and the need for}} their mother to care for him meant Richard was needed at the store. He remained in his hometown and attended Whittier College, his expenses there covered by a bequest from his maternal grandfather. Nixon played for the basketball team; he also tried out for football but lacked the size to play. He remained on the team as a substitute and was noted for his enthusiasm. Instead of fraternities and sororities, Whittier had literary societies. Nixon was snubbed by the only one for men, the Franklins; many members of the Franklins were from prominent families, but Nixon was not. He responded by helping to found a new society, the Orthogonian Society. In addition to the society, schoolwork, and work at the store, Nixon found time for a large number of extracurricular activities, becoming a champion debater and gaining a reputation as <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>worker.</b> In 1933, he became engaged to Ola Florence Welch, daughter of the Whittier police chief. The two broke up in 1935.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of his career Rodman was known for his defensive hustle, which was later accompanied by his rebounding prowess. In Detroit, he was mainly played as a small forward, and his usual assignment was to neutralize the opponent's best player; Rodman was so versatile that he could guard centers, forwards, or guards equally well and won two NBA Defensive Player of the Year Awards. From 1991 on, he established himself {{as one of the best}} rebounders of all time, averaging at least 15 rebounds per game in six of the next seven years. Playing power forward as member of the Spurs and the Bulls, he had a historical outburst in the 1996 NBA Finals: he twice snared 11 offensive rebounds, equalling an all-time NBA record. In addition, he had a career-high 34-rebound game on March 4, 1992. Rodman's rebounding prowess with Detroit and San Antonio was also aided by his decreased attention to defensive positioning and helping teammates on defense. Daly said Rodman was selfish about rebounding, but deemed him <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>worker</b> and coachable. Rodman's defensive intensity returned while with Chicago.|$|E
25|$|In 1791, {{at the age}} of 16, Eckford left Scotland – {{to which}} he never {{returned}} – to begin a five-year shipbuilding apprenticeship with his mothers brother, the noted Scottish-born Canadian shipwright John Black, at a shipyard Black had established on the St. Lawrence River in Lower Canada. Eckford proved to be <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>worker</b> and quick learner, with a flair for shipbuilding and ship design. When Black moved to Kingston on Lake Ontario late in 1792, Eckford followed to continue his apprenticeship, but the two soon went their separate ways, with Black moving to Quebec City to pursue revolutionary politics while Eckford stayed behind in Kingston to continue to learn the shipbuilding trade. In 1794, Eckford joined a Freemason Lodge in Kingston, beginning a long association with Freemasonry.|$|E
50|$|At the elimination, the Blue team {{decided to}} boot out Yana over Peachy, {{because they believe}} Peachy is <b>a</b> very <b>hard</b> <b>worker.</b> Yana then says her goodbyes and {{reflects}} on how far she has come since day one in The Biggest Loser.|$|R
50|$|Tory {{was known}} to be <b>an</b> {{extremely}} <b>hard</b> <b>worker,</b> often taking on large workloads. Some time around 1511, he became a professor at Collège de Coqueret, and soon after at the Collège de Bourgogne, which at the time was a principal unit of the University of Paris. His lectures were said to draw large audiences.|$|R

500|$|After {{beginning}} the 2011–12 NHL {{season in the}} Ducks' organization, McGrattan was claimed off waivers by the Nashville Predators on October 11, 2011. The transaction resurrected his NHL career and earned praise from his former teammates who praised him as being a [...] "great guy" [...] and <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>worker.</b> McGrattan appeared in 30 games for Nashville, including his 200th career game on December 8 against the Columbus Blue Jackets. After two games with the Predators in the lockout-shortened 2012–13 season, McGrattan {{was assigned to the}} AHL's Milwaukee Admirals.|$|E
500|$|It was {{announced}} that Raekwon of the Wu-Tang Clan would also be featured on the song, who West had invited to Hawaii. Raekwon initially {{had no interest in}} working with West musically, and originally only went to Hawaii to share some insight with him. According to the rapper, a lot of artists in the music industry refuse to be honest and give genuine advice because they don't want to help their competition, comparing the mentality to a group of crabs in a barrel. One of the reasons for Raekwon's desire to give West advice was because the frontman of the Wu-Tang Clan, RZA, spoke positively of West. RZA stated that West embodied the mentality of the Wu-Tang Clan, and praised his skills as a producer. RZA {{was a part of the}} recording sessions for the album in Hawaii, and contributed to the production of songs [...] "Dark Fantasy" [...] and [...] "So Appalled". Eventually after being impressed by West himself, Raekwon decided to collaborate with West on several tracks, including [...] "Gorgeous". Raekwon described West as <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>worker,</b> and stated that the [...] "first thing I can tell you about Kanye West is that he's <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>worker.</b> When you look at him, you can tell that he still has that whole hip-hop thing in his bones." ...|$|E
500|$|Laich is <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>worker,</b> and {{dedicated}} to his team, saying, [...] "If I asked {{you about your}} family, you would talk about them forever because it's something you love. That's the way I feel about this team. This team is my life, and I love playing here and I'm passionate about playing hockey. So it's {{easy for me to}} talk about it." [...] Boudreau has said, [...] "You are never going to find a guy that cares more than Brooks Laich." [...] Laich spends time in the off-season with a power skating instructor, which he feels is key to a long career.|$|E
5000|$|Stog (mule): A mule {{previously}} {{owned by}} the Dragonblade and longed for the glory days he had with his group despite his friendship with Wistala.

He is shot and killed by Barbarians while trying to protect Mossbell.|$|R
5000|$|Lycurgus {{himself was}} said to be mild, gentle, forgiving, and calm in temper, even when attacked; he was thought to have been {{extraordinarily}} sober and <b>an</b> extremely <b>hard</b> <b>worker,</b> all qualities that other Greeks admired in the Spartans; in this sense he was also the [...] "founder" [...] of the admirable qualities displayed by contemporary Spartans of later ages.|$|R
5000|$|Bob Burnet {{played for}} six seasons for Hawick RFC up to 1888. He was {{captain of the}} club in the 1887 season and was also {{selected}} to play for his county side, Roxburgh. He was described as [...] "a good sterling forward and <b>a</b> very <b>hard</b> <b>worker</b> in the mauls, and can always be relied upon turning out in good condition" ...|$|R
500|$|... "The show is {{extremely}} technical, extremely fast-paced, and {{the variety of}} music is amazing. [...] It goes from screaming heavy metal to techno dance, to Country and Western; there's even a flamenco hootenanny where everyone comes down front, beats on logs and plays acoustic guitars and pennywhistles. Then {{it goes back to}} 'Holiday' which is an old dance number. It keeps you steppin'. Madonna sings everything live. She's been that way from the beginning of her career, even with all the athletic dancing. She's <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>worker</b> and she expects everybody else to work as hard or harder. I respect that." ...|$|E
500|$|At first, Hand found Harvard a {{difficult}} social environment. He was not selected {{for any of}} the social clubs that dominated campus life, and he felt this exclusion keenly. He was equally unsuccessful with the Glee Club and the football team; for a time he rowed as a substitute for the rowing club. He later described himself as a [...] "serious boy", <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>worker</b> who did not smoke, drink, or consort with prostitutes. He mixed more in his sophomore and senior years. He {{became a member of the}} Hasty Pudding Club and appeared as a blond-wigged chorus girl in the 1892 student musical. He was also elected president of The Harvard Advocate, a student literary magazine.|$|E
500|$|Parry {{was known}} as a {{religious}} man and <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>worker</b> both at the iron works and at his craft. Despite his recognition in Wales and in the United States, he was not a wealthy man. Parry had little aptitude for business. [...] With his permission, a committee of his friends managed his affairs, with Parry creating compositions and his friends tending to the business of publications. Since his compositions were based primarily on Welsh subjects, many of Parry's friends believed it would have been to his advantage to have settled in London, where there were more cosmopolitan experiences to draw inspiration from. In 1859, Parry and his family became citizens of the United States; he was equally proud of being a Welshman and a United States citizen.|$|E
5000|$|Minh, Bình's older brother, is the sous-chef in the Governor-General's house under Chef Blériot.

Bình realizes, however, that despite Minh's hard work and skill, he can never become a head chef under French Colonialism in Vietnam.|$|R
50|$|He became General Manager of North West Thames Regional Health Authority in 1991. Between 1994 and 2000 {{he served}} as the chief {{executive}} of the NHS executive in England where he was the Secretary of State’s principal policy adviser for the NHS. He was known as <b>a</b> formidably <b>hard</b> <b>worker.</b> In 1998 he received a Knighthood in the Queen's Birthday Honours for his services to the NHS.|$|R
5000|$|Safiullah, {{the bureau}} chief of Dunya TV, stated that Atif was <b>a</b> pleasant, <b>hard</b> <b>worker.</b> David Ensor, {{director}} for Voice of America, stated [...] "Atif risked his life {{on a daily basis}} to provide his audience with fair and balanced news from this critical region and we mourn the loss of our colleague." [...] Atif was trained to educate journalists on how to protect themselves.|$|R
500|$|In December 1895, the Boston Daily Globe {{published}} a lengthy biography of Lowe, whom the paper described as Boston's [...] "quiet, unassuming but phenomenal second baseman." [...] The Globe {{noted that the}} ease with which Lowe played the game led many to understate his value to the club:"For a grand player, Lowe is seldom given the credit often dished out to his inferiors. His work does not appeal to the bleachers and grandstand like the less natural and clumsy player who is often seen floundering around like a fish out of water, while the crowd enjoy the effort and go home to tell what great playing they saw. 'He is a hard worker,' you will hear them say. Bobby Lowe is not only <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>worker</b> but a conscientious player and an artist of the first magnitude." ...|$|E
500|$|Taft {{exercised}} {{the power}} of his position to influence the decisions of his colleagues, urging unanimity and discouraging dissents. Alpheus Mason, in his article on Chief Justice Taft for the American Bar Association Journal, contrasted Taft's expansive view {{of the role of the}} chief justice with the narrow view of presidential power he took while in that office. Taft saw nothing wrong with making his views on possible appointments to the court known to the White House, and was annoyed to be criticized in the press. He was initially a firm supporter of President Coolidge after Harding's death in 1923, but became disillusioned with Coolidge's appointments to office and to the bench; he had similar misgivings about Coolidge's successor, Herbert Hoover. Taft advised the Republican presidents in office while he was chief justice to avoid [...] "offside" [...] appointments like Brandeis and Holmes. Nevertheless, by 1923, Taft was writing of his liking for Brandeis, whom he deemed <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>worker,</b> and Holmes walked to work with him until age and infirmity required an automobile.|$|E
500|$|On 16 March 2011, judge Kyle Sandilands {{announced}} on his breakfast radio show, Kyle & Jackie O {{that he would}} not be returning to the judging panel for the third season. Of his decision, Sandilands said, [...] "Not because I didn't like it. I thought the show was great and it was great fun to do but it's just too hectic, it's too much work. So, I've told Channel Seven, no." [...] On 31 March 2011, it was announced that Natalie Bassingthwaighte would join the judging panel as a replacement for Natalie Imbruglia. When speaking of her role as a judge, Bassingthwaighte said she would focus on bringing an honest critique to the show and would guide [...] "the artists through the competition". In late April 2011, it was confirmed that Mel B would be Sandilands' replacement. Mel B said, [...] " [...] are either going to love me or hate me but it's going to be a fun ride. I'm really easy to get on with and I'm <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>worker.</b> I'm firm but nice." [...] Guy Sebastian and Ronan Keating were the only judges from the second season who returned.|$|E
