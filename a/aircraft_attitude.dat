5|$|Furthermore, Peterson, who {{had failed}} an {{instrument}} checkride nine {{months before the}} accident, had received his instrument training on airplanes equipped with a conventional artificial horizon as source of <b>aircraft</b> <b>attitude</b> information, while N3794N was equipped with an older-type Sperry F3 attitude gyroscope.

5|$|The log-on message {{sent from}} the {{aircraft}} at 08:19:29 {{was not immediately}} well understood. The 02:25 handshake was also initiated by the aircraft. Only a few reasons that the SDU would transmit a log-on message exist, such as a power interruption, software failure, loss of critical systems providing input to the SDU, or a loss of the link due to <b>aircraft</b> <b>attitude.</b> Investigators consider the most likely reason to be that they were sent during power-up after an electrical outage. At 08:19, the aircraft had been airborne for 7h 38min; the typical Kuala Lumpur-Beijing flight is 5hours and fuel exhaustion was likely. In the event of fuel exhaustion and engine flame-out, the aircraft's ram air turbine would deploy, providing power to various instruments and flight controls, including the SDU. Approximately 90seconds after the 02:25 handshake, communications from the aircraft's inflight entertainment system were recorded in the ground station log. Similar messages would be expected following the 08:19 handshake but none were received, supporting the fuel starvation scenario.|$|E
500|$|Since the A-10 flies low to {{the ground}} and at subsonic speed, {{aircraft}} camouflage is important to make the aircraft more difficult to see. Many different types of paint schemes have been tried. These have included a [...] "peanut scheme" [...] of sand, yellow and field drab; black and white colors for winter operations and a tan, green and brown mixed pattern. Many A-10s also featured a false canopy painted in dark gray {{on the underside of the}} aircraft, just behind the gun. This form of automimicry is an attempt to confuse the enemy as to <b>aircraft</b> <b>attitude</b> and maneuver direction. Many A-10s feature nose art, such as shark mouth or warthog head features.|$|E

50|$|Almost {{all modern}} jet airliners are fitted with inboard lift {{spoilers}} {{which are used}} together during descent to increase the rate of descent and control speed.

50|$|Most airliners and {{transport}} aircraft feature a large, slow-moving trimmable tail plane which {{is combined with}} independently-moving elevators. The elevators are controlled by the pilot or autopilot and primarily serve to change the <b>aircraft’s</b> <b>attitude,</b> while the whole assembly is used to trim (maintaining horizontal static equilibrium) and stabilize the aircraft in the pitch axis.|$|R

50|$|The captain's mistaken {{perception}} of the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>attitude</b> resulted in his using the aircraft flight control system to add more left bank and left rudder, causing the Boeing 747 to rapidly lose altitude.

50|$|A 1939 {{government}} {{study found}} the I-16 had exhausted its performance potential. The addition of armor, radio, battery, and flaps during the aircraft's evolution exacerbated the rear weight distribution problems {{to the point}} where the aircraft required considerable forward pressure on the stick to maintain level flight and at the same time developed a tendency to enter uncontrolled dives. Extension and retraction of the landing flaps caused a dramatic change in the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>attitude.</b> Accurate gunfire was difficult.|$|R
50|$|Aerobatics (a {{portmanteau}} of aerial-acrobatics) is {{the practice}} of flying maneuvers involving <b>aircraft</b> <b>attitudes</b> that are not used in normal flight. Aerobatics are performed in airplanes and gliders for training, recreation, entertainment, and sport. Additionally, some helicopters, such as the MBB Bo 105, are capable of limited aerobatic maneuvers.

5000|$|On 25 November 1969, a SAHSA Douglas DC-3 (HR-ANA) crashed whilst {{attempting}} {{to land on}} runway 01 at Toncontin.

50|$|The {{body frame}} is often of {{interest}} because {{the origin and}} the axes remain fixed relative to the aircraft.

30|$|A {{rotorcraft}} was a type {{of civil}} unmanned aircraft system with low precision, which was widely used in the aerial, model aircraft, and navigation fields. Stability control of a rotorcraft represents a microcosm of an unmanned combat platform.

And the core aspect was decoding of the high-precision hovering attitude and position information in real time, such that the accurate four-degrees-of-freedom motion parameter information about hovering becomes an essential asset.|$|R

50|$|In actual use, {{the pilot}} {{initially}} sets {{the brightness of}} the line so that it just disappears when looking at it with his central vision.

5000|$|Specific design {{concepts}} for a vertical-takeoff-and-landing supersonic electric jet were first made public by Musk in 2014. The concept includes {{a large percentage}} of the aircraft by weight being made up of high-capacity batteries and significantly decreasing the amount of aircraft structure devoted to control surfaces, depending to a greater extent on [...] "gimbaling the electric fan" [...] for control of <b>aircraft</b> <b>attitude.</b>|$|E
50|$|These balance out, so {{on a large}} {{aircraft}} the equivalent aileron will accelerate the wing tip up or down {{at the same speed}} as a smaller aircraft. But on a wing twice the span, the tip must travel twice as far to achieve the same change in <b>aircraft</b> <b>attitude.</b> This takes longer, so a {{large aircraft}} manoeuvres more slowly than the equivalent smaller aircraft.|$|E

The effect on runway image geometry was examined for different <b>aircraft</b> <b>attitudes</b> and different <b>aircraft</b> positions relative to a standard three degree glide slope. Measurement errors investigated were errors in radar azimuth angle and range, and errors in those aircraft parameters supplied to the radar for use in converting the radar image into a perspective format (namely pitch, roll, and altitude). Also investigated were the effects of using certain mathematical approximations, such as small angle, in the coordinate transformation which converts the image to a perspective format...|$|R
