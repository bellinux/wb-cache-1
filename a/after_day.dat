5|$|The {{competition}} was split into several stages: auditions, bootcamp, home visits and live shows. Auditions {{in front of}} the show's producers took place throughout March and April 2011. The successful auditionees chosen by the producers were then invited back to the last set of auditions that took place {{in front of the}} judges and a live studio audience during May and June. After the auditions was bootcamp, where successful acts were split into four categories: Under 25 Boys (male soloists aged 14 to 24), Under 25 Girls (female soloists aged 14 to 24), Over 25s (soloists aged 25 and over) and Groups. Each judge was given a category to mentor and had to decide on their twelve acts <b>after</b> <b>day</b> two, and their six acts <b>after</b> <b>day</b> three. Special guest judges, including Wynter Gordon, Stephen Belafonte, Darren Hayes and The Veronicas, were brought in to help the judges decide their acts. Following bootcamp was the home visits stage, where each of the judges reduced their six acts to three, with help from more guest judges including Beyoncé, Melanie C, Jason Derulo, Good Charlotte and Leona Lewis. The live shows began on 19 September 2011.|$|E
5|$|Males perch after {{emerging}} from their nest. They pick out an area {{close to a}} nest with females inside and guard the territory around it so as {{to have a better}} chance of mating. They tend to perch on many different substrates such as stumps, pebbles, wood, weeds, grass blades and low tree branches. Males assume an alert posture, ready for a challenge from another male, or from a predator. One study by a behavioral ecologist, John Alcock, showed that a large majority of the marked wasps returned to the same perch day <b>after</b> <b>day,</b> and two males swapped between two different sites. The species rarely perches on the ground.|$|E

40|$|Effect of {{different}} combinations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) on six characters namely Root Length (RL), Root Fresh Weight (FRW), Root Volume (RV), Nodule Number (NN), Nodule Weight (NW) and Pod Fresh Weight (PFW) were studied in three lines such as Line- 2, Line- 16 and Line- 18 of blackgram. Analysis of variance showed that all the three lines are {{different from each other}} for each of the characters. Factorial analysis showed that N and P <b>after</b> 15 <b>days</b> of sowing, N and K <b>after</b> 30 <b>days</b> of sowing, NPK <b>after</b> 60 <b>days</b> of sowing and P, NP and NK <b>after</b> 75 <b>days</b> of sowing had significant effect on root length. N and NK after 30 and 90 days of sowing and N after 45 and 75 days of sowing had significant effect on root fresh weight. For root volume, N after 45 and 75 days of sowing and N and NK <b>after</b> 90 <b>days</b> of sowing had significant effect. N <b>after</b> 15 <b>days</b> of sowing, PK <b>after</b> 30 <b>days</b> of sowing, P <b>after</b> 45 <b>days</b> of sowing, K and NP <b>after</b> 60 <b>days</b> of sowing, K <b>after</b> 75 <b>days</b> of sowing and NK <b>after</b> 90 <b>days</b> of sowing found to be significantly effective for nodule number.

The next day, Frankie has grown outraged about her job as the house caretaker; Mr. Herriman has been giving her endless chores to take care day <b>after</b> <b>day</b> without thanking her for any of it. When Frankie discovers the box left on the doorstep, Herriman instructs her to leave it in the attic. In a fit of anger toward Herriman, she intentionally ignores the instructions given in the box and peeks inside it. She falls inside, only to discover it is a vast world filled with anthropomorphic toys and delectable treats.

5|$|Durkheim {{believed}} {{there was more to}} suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, a loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took suicide and explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one’s circumstances. Durkheim believed that suicide was an instance of social deviance. Social deviance being any transgression of socially established norms. He created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. The four different types of suicide that he proposed are egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. He began by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis. Egoistic suicide corresponds to a low level of social integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to a feeling that he or she has not made a difference in anyone’s lives. On the other hand, too much social integration would be altruistic suicide. This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. Anomic suicide occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term anomie meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. Lastly, there is fatalistic suicide, which results from too much social regulation. An example of this would be when one follows the same routine day <b>after</b> <b>day.</b> This leads to he or she believing there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.|$|E
