40|$|Humoral and {{cellular}} immune responses are currently induced against hepatitis C virus (HCV) core following vaccination with core-encoding plasmids. However, the <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibody</b> response is frequently weak or transient. In this paper, we evaluated {{the effect of}} different additives and DNA-protein combinations on the <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibody</b> response. BALB/c mice were intramuscularly injected with an expression plasmid (pIDKCo), encoding a C-terminal truncated variant of the HCV core protein, alone or combined with CaCl 2, PEG 6000, Freund's adjuvant, sonicated calf thymus DNA and a recombinant core protein (Co. 120). Mixture of pIDKCo with PEG 6000 and Freund's adjuvant accelerated {{the development of the}} anti-core Ab response. Combination with PEG 6000 also induced a bias to IgG 2 a subclass predominance among anti-core antibodies. The kinetics, IgG 2 a/IgG 1 ratio and epitope specificity of the <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibody</b> response elicited by Co. 120 alone or combined with pIDKCo was different regarding that induced by the pIDKCo alone. Our data indicate that the antibody response induced following DNA immunization can be modified by formulation strategies...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis C {{virus has}} three {{structural}} genes named C, E 1, and E 2. The C gene encodes the core (capsid) protein and the E 1 and E 2 genes encode the envelope proteins. In an immunoprecipitation experiment, the E 1 protein {{was found to}} be precipitated by an <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibody</b> in the presence but not {{in the absence of the}} core protein, indicating that the E 1 protein can interact with the core protein. This interaction is independent of whether the E 1 and the C genes are linked in cis or separated in different DNA constructs for expression. The interaction between the core and the E 1 proteins is confirmed by the observation that a hybrid protein derived from the core protein and the tissue plasminogen activator is localized in the nucleus in the absence of the E 1 protein and in the perinuclear region in the presence of the E 1 protein. Deletion-mapping studies indicate that the carboxy-terminal sequences of both the core and the E 1 proteins are important for their interaction. Since little E 1 sequence is exposed on the cytosolic side of the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, the interaction between the core and the E 1 proteins most likely takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The E 2 protein could not be coprecipitated with the core protein by the <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibody</b> in a similar assay and likely does not interact with the core protein. The implications of these findings on the morphogenesis of the hepatitis C virus virion are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{relation}} between antibody-response profiles to Escherichia coli-produced HIV- 1 nef, rev, tat, and protease proteins {{and the risk}} of developing AIDS was studied using stored serum samples taken sequentially from a cohort of 195 initially symptom-free men who were seropositive for antibodies to HIV- 1 structural proteins and 72 men who seroconverted for such antibodies. The AIDS attack rates at 39 months follow-up were significantly higher in the men with negative versus positive antibody profiles to nef, tat, and protease, respectively. [Difference (D) between attack rates = 11. 279, 5. 884, and 8. 322, respectively]. No significant difference was found between men with negative versus positive antibody profiles to rev. The above differences between AIDS attack rates were clearly lower than those reported from the same cohort for men who were serum HIV- 1 antigen positive versus negative, and for men with low versus normal CD 4 + lymphocyte counts, but with respect to nef antibody-response profiles, resembled the difference reported between anti-HIV- 1 core antibody-negative versus antibody-positive men. In the subgroup of men without any of the markers previously found to be predictive of progression to AIDS in the cohort (persistent HIV- 1 p 24 antigenemia, low anti-HIV- 1 <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibody</b> reactivity, and low CD 4 + cell counts), antibody profiles to nef, rev, tat, and protease did not contribute to the prediction of outcome of infection. When used in combination with persistent HIV- 1 p 24 antigenemia and low CD 4 + cell counts, negative antibody profiles to nef and protease, respectively, were equally sensitive and specific in predicting progression to AIDS, as was low anti-HIV- 1 <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibody</b> reactivit...|$|E
40|$|Endotoxin is {{composed}} of lipid A, the toxic moiety, of the core region, a conserved structure among Gram-negative bacteria, and of the O-side chains, a highly variable part responsible for the antigenic specificity. The concept of cross-protection afforded by antiserum raised against the core region of endotoxin {{is supported by the}} following data: experimentally antiserum protected against infections caused by a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria or endotoxins; in patients with Gram-negative bacteremia, survival was associated with high levels of <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibodies,</b> and mortality was reduced by the prophylactic or therapeutic use of immune serum or plasma. However, the proof that protection is afforded by cross-protective <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibodies</b> is still lacking. Furthermore, many experimental studies and clinical studies trials have shown controversial results. Ongoing experimental studies and recently completed clinical trials, using either polyclonal or monoclonal <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibodies</b> should help clarify the issues both of the clinical efficacy and of the mechanism of protection. Tumor necrosis factor/cachectin has been unequivocally shown, both in experimental animal models and in humans to be a pivotal mediator of the clinical and humoral manifestations of shock induced by endotoxin or by whole Gram-negative bacteria. In humans, TNF was been transiently detected in the blood of volunteers challenged with endotoxin, in a small proportion of patients with Gram-negative sepsis, but {{in the vast majority of}} patients with established septic shock. However, in patients the magnitude and the evolution of the blood concentration of TNF differed from that observed in animal models or in human volunteers after an acute challenge with either Gram-negative bacteria or endotoxin, probably reflecting differences in infectious stimuli. In children with meningococemia and in adults with Gram-negative septic shock, TNF was associated with the patient's outcome. Anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies are presently undergoing clinical investigation in patients with septic shock. However, one should keep in mind that TNF serves both beneficial and detrimental functions depending upon its concentration in body fluids...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the clinical feasibility of the antibody titer against a chimeric polypeptide (named Core 518), {{in which a}} domain of Core and NS 3 of hepatitis C virus (HCV) was fused, ELISA was performed {{in a total of}} 76 serum samples. Each serum was serially diluted using two-fold dilution method with distilled water into 10 concentrations. They were all positive for second generation anti-HCV assay (HCV EIA II; Abbott Laboratories). Genotyping RT-PCR, quantitative competitive RT-PCR, and RIBA (Lucky Confirm; LG Biotech) were also assayed. <b>Anti-Core</b> 518 <b>antibody</b> was detected in x 12800 or higher dilutions of sera from 35 of 43 chronic hepatitis C (81. 4 %) and nine of 16 hepatocellular carcinoma sera (56. 3 %), one of four cirrhosis (25 %), 0 of four acute hepatitis C, and one of nine healthy isolated anti-HCV-positive subjects (p= 0. 0000). The <b>anti-Core</b> 518 <b>antibody</b> titers were well correlated with the presence of HCV RNA in serum (p= 0. 002). The <b>anti-Core</b> 518 <b>antibody</b> titers decreased significantly in nine of ten responders to IFN-alpha treatment. Monitoring anti-Core 518 titers may be helpful not only for differentiating the status of HCV infection among patients with various type C viral liver diseases, but also for predicting responses to IFN-alpha treatment...|$|R
40|$|Background. An {{experimental}} {{vaccine for}} sepsis, composed of detoxified Escherichia coli J 5 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) complexed with the outer membrane protein (OMP) of Neisseria meningitidis group B, induces <b>anti–core</b> glycolipid <b>antibody</b> {{and has been}} tested in pilot studies in human volunteers. Methods. Mice were immunized with the LPS-J 5 /OMP vaccine with or without synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) containing unmethylated CpG motifs as a vaccine adjuvant (CpG ODN). The efficacy of the vaccine-induced antibody response was tested in a cecal ligation and puncture model. Results. Immunization resulted in a 120 -fold increase in <b>anti–core</b> glycolipid <b>antibody</b> levels, which were further increased 5 -fold {{by the addition of}} CpG ODN, compared with the levels in mice in the control group. The vaccine provided a survival advantage after a cecal ligation and puncture was performed () and sig-P!. 01 nificantly decreased the levels of bacteria in organs. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) <b>anti–core</b> glycolipid <b>antibodies</b> were decreased in mice to a significantly greater extent than were levels of total circulating IgG or IgG to the OMP part of the vaccine complex, suggesting specific epitope binding and clearance. Conclusions. These results indicate that the detoxified LPS-J 5 /OMP vaccine induces high levels of antibody against the core glycolipid of LPS and functions in vivo to promote clearance of gram-negative bacteria and improve the outcome of experimental polymicrobial intra-abdominal sepsis...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the in vitro antibody production from {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) against HIV- 1 proteins in infected adults. Fifty-four HIV- 1 infected patients (four recent seroconverters, 15 asymptomatics with a CD 4 count higher than 500 /microliters, 27 asymptomatics with a CD 4 count between 200 and 500 /microliters and eight symptomatic patients) were tested. PBMC were incubated {{in the presence}} or absence of 1 % pokeweed mitogen (PWM) at 37 degrees C for 8 days. Western blot assay, p 24 antigen ELISA and anti-p 24 antibody ELISA were performed on serum and culture supernatants. Spontaneous production of anti-env antibody in culture supernatants was evidenced in all subjects. All the positive supernatants for anti-core antibodies (18 / 54) were derived from asymptomatic patients. PBMC from recent seroconverters and from symptomatic patients did not produce any <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibody.</b> Antibody production decreased after stimulation with PWM. The concentration of p 24 antigen did not significantly increase in p 24 positive supernatants following acidification (P = 0. 1), suggesting that the inability to detect p 24 antibody was not due to the anti-p 24 antibody complexed to p 24 antigen in culture supernatants. In vitro production of anti-p 24 antibodies was significantly more frequent in asymptomatic subjects with high CD 4 + cell counts (P = 0. 02) and was absent in recent seroconverters. This last finding suggests that during the initial phases of the infection, anti-p 24 antibody production may be restricted to cells residing in lymphoid organs. In addition, the lower percentage of <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibody</b> in people with low CD 4 + cell counts is not merely a consequence of the binding of the antibody to an increased amount of antigen, but probably reflects an impaired production or a sequestration of producing cells in lymphoid tissue during the late stages of the infection...|$|E

40|$|Firemen {{have been}} {{considered}} at occupational risk of hepatitis (HBV) infection, but proof is lacking. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the degree of risk by determining the prevalence of serological markers of past infection with HBV in members of the West Yorkshire Fire Service. Sera from 173 firemen, 9. 3 % of the brigade, were tested for antibodies to HBV surface antigen and to core antigen. Those containing anti-HBs greater than or equal to 10 IU/L or <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibody,</b> were also tested for antibody to HBe antigen. The presence of more than one marker was used to define past infection. One sample satisfied this criterion, giving a prevalence rate of 0. 6 %. This compares with a rate of 1 % in London blood donors. We conclude that the group shows no evidence of having been at increased risk of HBV infection.

40|$|International audienceThe {{biological}} role of {{the protein}} encoded by the alternative open reading frame (core+ 1 /ARF) of the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome remains elusive, as does {{the significance of the}} production of corresponding antibodies in HCV infection. We investigated the prevalence of anti-core and anti-core+ 1 /ARFP antibodies in HCV-positive blood donors from Cambodia, using peptide and recombinant protein-based ELISAs. We detected unusual serological profiles in 3 out of 58 HCV positive plasma of genotype 1 a. These patients were negative for <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibodies</b> by commercial and peptide-based assays using C-terminal fragments of core but reacted by Western Blot with full-length core protein. All three patients had high levels of anti-core+ 1 /ARFP antibodies. Cloning of the cDNA that corresponds to the core-coding region from these sera resulted in the expression of both core and core+ 1 /ARFP in mammalian cells. The core protein exhibited high amino-acid homology with a consensus HCV 1 a sequence. However, 10 identical synonymous mutations were found, and 7 were located in the aa(99 - 124) region of core. All mutations concerned the third base of a codon, and 5 / 10 represented a T>C mutation. Prediction analyses of the RNA secondary structure revealed conformational changes within the stem-loop region that contains the core+ 1 /ARFP internal AUG initiator at position 85 / 87. Using the luciferase tagging approach, we showed that core+ 1 /ARFP expression is more efficient from such a sequence than from the prototype HCV 1 a RNA. We provide additional evidence of the existence of core+ 1 /ARFP in vivo and new data concerning expression of HCV core protein. We show that HCV patients who do not produce normal <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibodies</b> have unusually high levels of antit-core+ 1 /ARFP and harbour several identical synonymous mutations in the core and core+ 1 /ARFP coding region that result in major changes in predicted RNA structure. Such HCV variants may favour core+ 1 /ARFP production during HCV infection...|$|R

40|$|The {{putative}} hepatitis C {{virus core}} protein has a predicted molecular weight of about 22 kD and contains two carboxy (COOH) -terminal hydrophobic domains. The cleavages generating the hepatitis C virus structural proteins (core, El and E 2) are catalyzed by host signal peptidases. In the present study, we investigated the processing and intracellular localization of the hepatitis C virus core protein expressed in mammalian cells.

Immunofluorescent staining with either polyclonal immunoglobulin or monoclonal <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibodies</b> showed that fragments containing the COOH-terminal hydrophobic stretch were retained in the cytoplasm of transfected cells, whereas truncated core proteins deleted of 28 or more residues were located in the nucleus.

40|$|The {{identification}} and characterization of conserved epitopes on the HIV- 1 viral spike that are immunogenic in humans and targeted by neutralizing antibodies {{is an important}} step in vaccine design. Antibody cloning experiments revealed that 32 % of all HIV-neutralizing antibodies expressed by the memory B cells in patients with high titers of broadly neutralizing antibodies recognize one or more “core” epitopes that were not defined. Here, we show that anti-core antibodies recognize a single conserved epitope on the gp 120 subunit. Amino acids D 474, M 475, R 476, which are essential for <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibody</b> binding, form an immunodominant triad at the outer domain/inner domain junction of gp 120. The mutation of these residues to alanine impairs viral fusion and fitness. Thus, the core epitope, a frequent target of anti–HIV-neutralizing antibodies, including the broadly neutralizing antibody HJ 16, is conserved and indispensible for viral infectivity. We conclude that the core epitope should be considered as a target for vaccine design...|$|E

Eleven of the 20 CAH patients showed a significant T lymphocyte proliferative response to HBcAg, whereas no proliferation was detectable in response to envelope antigens (HBs and pre-S) in any patient. T cell subset fractionation revealed that HBcAg specific proliferation {{was limited to the}} CD 4 + (helper/inducer) population.

40|$|AbstractHepatitis B virus (HBV) is a DNA virus which {{replicates}} via reverse transcription. The {{structure and}} function of the reverse transcriptase play important roles in HBV replication. We have previously reported that when proline at residue 306 in HBV reverse transcriptase was substituted by other amino acids, most of the mutants showed decreased replicative competency. To explore the mechanisms for this decrease in replicative competency, constructs with substituted amino acid residues at rtP 306 were used to transfect Huh- 7 cells, and replication competencies, transcription levels and encapsidation efficiencies of the mutants and the parental viral strain were compared. Decreased replication competency was found {{with many of the}} mutants and confirmed by trans-complementation between each mutant and a replication-defective replicon. No change in transcriptional level was detected between all mutated constructs. The encapsidation competencies of these constructs were studied by assaying pregenomic RNAs in intracytoplamic core particles from transfected cells, which were normalized for the amount of HBV core protein by Western blotting using <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Impaired encapsidation was found in several mutants substituted at residue 306, thereby demonstrating {{for the first time that}} conservation of proline at this residue is crucial for efficient encapsidation of pregenomic RNA...|$|R

To assess whether unique or specific HS proteoglycans (HSPGs) may be involved in the formation of these lesions, we have investigated the accumulation of several distinct HSPG epitopes in the cerebra of patients with different forms of neurodegenerative disease. A panel composed of several antibodies revealed distinctive patterns of HSPG accumulation. In patients with dementia of the Lewy body type, the burned-out-type plaques and preamyloid-type plaques were strongly stained by both the anti-HS 'chain' and anti-HS 'stub' antibodies, but by none of the available <b>anti-core</b> protein <b>antibodies.</b> In Alzheimer's disease, the preamyloid-type plaques, dense-cored-type plaques, neuritic-type plaques and the neurofibrillary tangles were stained by the anti-'stub' antibody.

40|$|A precore-deficient mutant of duck {{hepatitis}} B virus (DHBV) produced by site-directed mutagenesis was tested {{for its ability}} to compete with wild-type virus in a mixed infection of 3 -day-old ducklings. The mutation was shown to produce a cis-acting defect, resulting in a replication rate that was about one-half that of wild-type virus. Accordingly, wild-type virus was rapidly selected during the spread of infection. During the chronic phase of the infection, however, two selection patterns were seen. In 4 of 10 ducks, the wild-type virus slowly replaced the precore mutant. In another four ducks, the precore mutant virus slowly replaced the wild-type virus. In the remaining two ducklings, ratios of wild-type and precore mutant virus fluctuated, with wild-type virus slowly predominating. The replacement of wild-type virus was not due to the emergence of a rapidly replicating variant of the precore mutant, since genomes cloned from the infected ducks retained their original replication defect. Replacement of wild-type virus, however, correlated with elevated <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibody</b> titers, which continued to increase with time. The selection of a precore-negative strain of DHBV may be analogous to the selection for precore mutants of HBV during chronic hepatitis in humans...|$|E

One chimpanzee, inoculated sequentially with saliva from three individuals, developed HBsAg at 9 weeks and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase elevation at 13 weeks after injection.

HBsAg was positive in two consecutive samples and was confirmed by specific neutralization. Autopsy did not reveal evidence of hepatitis.

All patients with a marker for HCV infection had persistent normal levels of transaminases. Three patients had elevated ALT values without a marker for HCV infection and suffered from hepatitis B virus infection.

40|$|A current {{concept of}} the {{serological}} response to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in humans is that antibodies to core antigens (p 55, p 24, and p 15) are detectable earlier during initial stages of antibody production than antibodies against envelope antigens (gp 160, gp 120, and gp 41). Comparative studies of Western blot (immunoblot), radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) during initial antibody production are limited to case reports and have not resolved the issue. Thirty of the 37 participants {{who are part of}} a prospective study had at least one specimen that was negative for anti-gp 41 but had one or more other bands on Western blot. Twenty-seven of these 30 specimens were reactive for anti-gp 120 / 160 in the RIPA. Of the same 30 specimens, kits from Bionetics identified 2 (7 %), ElectroNucleonics 4 (13 %), Abbott 13 (43 %), Du Pont 25 (83 %), and Genetic Systems 25 (83 %). All participants had evidence of serological progression by Western blot, including a gp 41 band, on subsequent visits; the ELISA kits of all manufacturers identified these later specimens with greater accuracy. These data show that the RIPA detects anti-envelope antibodies that may be not detectable by Western blot and that the production of anti-envelope antibodies approximately parallels the production of <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibodies.</b> The false-negative results by ELISA would permit transmission of HIV by blood transfusion from donors in early stages of infection.

40|$|International audienceWe have {{previously}} demonstrated that viral particles with {{the properties of}} nonenveloped hepatitis C virus (HCV) nucleocapsids occur in the serum of HCV-infected individuals (1). We show here that nucleocapsids purified directly from serum or isolated from HCV virions have FcgammaR-like activity and bind "nonimmune" IgG via its Fcgamma domain. HCV core proteins produced in Escherichia coli and in the baculovirus expression system also bound "nonimmune" IgG and their Fcgamma fragments. Folded conformation was required for IgG binding because the FcgammaR-like site of the core protein was inactive in denaturing conditions. Studies with synthetic core peptides showed that the region spanning amino acids 3 - 75 was essential for formation of the IgG-binding site. The interaction between the HCV core and human IgG is more efficient in acidic (pH 6. 0) than in neutral conditions. The core protein-binding site on the IgG molecule differs from those for C 1 q, FcgammaRII (CD 32), and FcgammaRIII (CD 16) but overlaps with that for soluble protein A from Staphylococcus aureus (SpA), which {{is located in the}} CH 2 -CH 3 interface of IgG. These characteristics of the core-IgG interaction are very {{similar to those of the}} neonatal FcRn. Surface plasmon resonance studies suggested that the binding of an <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibody</b> to HCV core protein might be "bipolar" through its paratope to the corresponding epitope and by its Fcgamma region to the FcgammaR-like motif on this protein. These features of HCV nucleocapsids and HCV core protein may confer an advantage for HCV in terms of survival by interfering with host defense mechanisms mediated by the Fcgamma part of IgG. We {{have previously}} demonstrated that viral particles with the properties of nonenveloped hepatitis C virus (HCV) nucleocapsids occur in the serum of HCV-infected individuals (1). We show here that nucleocapsids purified directly from serum or isolated from HCV virions have FcgammaR-like activity and bind "nonimmune" IgG via its Fcgamma domain. HCV core proteins produced in Escherichia coli and in the baculovirus expression system also bound "nonimmune" IgG and their Fcgamma fragments. Folded conformation was required for IgG binding because the FcgammaR-like site of the core protein was inactive in denaturing conditions. Studies with synthetic core peptides showed that the region spanning amino acids 3 - 75 was essential for formation of the IgG-binding site. The interaction between the HCV core and human IgG is more efficient in acidic (pH 6. 0) than in neutral conditions. The core protein-binding site on the IgG molecule differs from those for C 1 q, FcgammaRII (CD 32), and FcgammaRIII (CD 16) but overlaps with that for soluble protein A from Staphylococcus aureus (SpA), which is located in the CH 2 -CH 3 interface of IgG. These characteristics of the core-IgG interaction are very similar to those of the neonatal FcRn. Surface plasmon resonance studies suggested that the binding of an <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibody</b> to HCV core protein might be "bipolar" through its paratope to the corresponding epitope and by its Fcgamma region to the FcgammaR-like motif on this protein.

40|$|A highly {{sensitive}} enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) core antigen (HCVcAg) was developed, and its performance was {{compared with that}} of the AMPLICOR HCV test (Roche Molecular Systems). The developed one-step pretreatment method, 30 -min incubation of the specimen with a solution containing three different types of detergents (Triton X- 100, 3 -[(3 -cholamidopropyl) -dimethylammonio]- 1 -propanesulfonate [CHAPS], and sodium dodecyl sulfate), does not require any special device. Because the interfering <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibody</b> in the sample was sufficiently inactivated by the pretreatment, HCVcAg in the sample could be detected. The immunoreactivity on gel filtration was shifted from void fractions to those corresponding to the molecular mass range from 20 to 25 kDa, which is equal to the estimated molecular mass of HCVcAg, after the pretreatment. By the recovery test with HCVcAg-positive serum, the recovery rate was 93. 5 to 106. 5 %. There was no interference with the EIA by anticoagulants or blood components in the serum. When the cutoff value was tentatively set at 0. 5 mU/ml based on the distribution of healthy subjects’ sera, the sera of all healthy subjects (n = 125) and patients with hepatitis B (n = 50) were negative. HCVcAg was detected in sera from 57 of 73 individuals (78. 1 %) with anti-HCV antibody. Similarly, HCV RNA was detected in sera from 59 individuals (80. 8 %) with the AMPLICOR HCV as the qualitative test (AMPLICOR HCV test) and in sera from 54 individuals (74. 0 %) by the AMPLICOR HCV Monitor as the quantitative test (AMPLICOR Monitor test). Concentrations of HCVcAg and HCV RNA (measured by the AMPLICOR Monitor test) correlated significantly (r = 0. 8, P < 0. 001). On seroconversion panels, HCVcAg was detected during the early stage of infection, when anti-HCV antibodies had not been produced. This assay for HCVcAg is simpler than assays for HCV RNA based on gene technology and shows specificity and sensitivity equivalent to those of the AMPLICOR HCV test...|$|E
40|$|Negative {{strands of}} the {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) genome (a positive-stranded RNA virus) {{have been found}} in a nuclease-resistant form in the serum of patients with HCV infections. We determined whether a complete negative-strand copy is present in the serum, whether the negative strand is particle-associated, and finally, whether it is virion-associated and encapsidated like the positive (genomic) strand. Isopyknic sucrose and cesium chloride density ultracentrifugation followed by a strand-specific reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on the collected fractions was performed to determine whether both positive and negative strands were associated with similar particles. Both strands comigrated to approximately the same density (1. 11 - 1. 16 g/cm 3) in sucrose. After treatment of the plasma with detergent (0. 1 % Nonidet P- 40) to remove the viral envelope and centrifugation on cesium chloride gradients, the positive strands shifted to a density of 1. 35 g/cm 3, and the negative strands were not detected. By using antibodies specific for the HCV core or envelope glycoproteins E 1 or E 2 coated onto the wells of a microtiter plate, it was possible to specifically bind HCV or viral cores to the solid phase. Pelleted virus particles were resuspended in either PBS or PBS with 0. 1 % Nonidet P- 40 to expose the core. These pellets were then incubated in antibody-coated microtiter wells. RNA extracted from the bound and unbound fractions was tested for HCV RNA. The <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibody</b> was able to bind positive strands but not negative strands only in detergent-treated samples. In the nondetergent-treated pellets, the anti-E 1 and -E 2 bound the positive strand, but only anti-E 1 bound the negative strands. These findings indicate that while both strands of HCV RNA can be detected in serum, the positive strand is encapsidated within the enveloped core, and the negative strand appears to be in a membrane particle associated with the viral envelope protein E 1 but {{does not appear to be}} within the HCV core of circulating virions...|$|E
40|$|The {{biological}} role of {{the protein}} encoded by the alternative open reading frame (core+ 1 /ARF) of the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome remains elusive, as does {{the significance of the}} production of corresponding antibodies in HCV infection. We investigated the prevalence of anti-core and anti-core+ 1 /ARFP antibodies in HCV-positive blood donors from Cambodia, using peptide and recombinant protein-based ELISAs. We detected unusual serological profiles in 3 out of 58 HCV positive plasma of genotype 1 a. These patients were negative for <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibodies</b> by commercial and peptide-based assays using C-terminal fragments of core but reacted by Western Blot with full-length core protein. All three patients had high levels of anti-core+ 1 /ARFP antibodies. Cloning of the cDNA that corresponds to the core-coding region from these sera resulted in the expression of both core and core+ 1 /ARFP in mammalian cells. The core protein exhibited high amino-acid homology with a consensus HCV 1 a sequence. However, 10 identical synonymous mutations were found, and 7 were located in the aa(99 – 124) region of core. All mutations concerned the third base of a codon, and 5 / 10 represented a T. C mutation. Prediction analyses of the RNA secondary structure revealed conformational changes within the stem-loop region that contains the core+ 1 /ARFP internal AUG initiator at position 85 / 87. Using the luciferase tagging approach, we showed that core+ 1 /ARFP expression is more efficient from such a sequence than from the prototype HCV 1 a RNA. We provid...|$|R

40|$|A {{distinctive}} feature of HCV {{is that its}} life cycle depends on lipoprotein metabolism. Viral morphogenesis and secretion follow the very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) biogenesis pathway and, consequently, infectious HCV in the serum is associated with triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL). Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) hydrolyzes TRL within chylomicrons and VLDL but, independently of its catalytic activity, it has a bridging activity, mediating the hepatic uptake of chylomicrons and VLDL remnants. We previously showed that exogenously added LPL increases HCV binding to hepatoma cells by acting as a bridge between virus-associated lipoproteins and cell surface heparan sulfate, while simultaneously decreasing infection levels. We show here that LPL efficiently inhibits cell infection with two HCV strains produced in hepatoma cells or in primary human hepatocytes transplanted into uPA-SCID mice with fully functional human ApoB-lipoprotein profiles. Viruses produced in vitro or in vivo were separated on iodixanol gradients into low and higher density populations, and the infection of Huh 7. 5 cells by both virus populations was inhibited by LPL. The effect of LPL depended on its enzymatic activity. However, the lipase inhibitor tetrahydrolipstatin restored only a minor part of HCV infectivity, suggesting an important role of the LPL bridging function in the inhibition of infection. We followed HCV cell entry by immunoelectron microscopy with anti-envelope and <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibodies.</b> These analyses demonstrated the internalization of virus particles into hepatoma cells and their presence in intracellular vesicles and associated with lipid droplets. In the presence of LPL, HCV was retained at the cell surface. We conclude that LPL efficiently inhibits HCV infection by acting on TRL associated with HCV particles through mechanisms involving its lipolytic function, but mostly its bridging function. These mechanisms lead to immobilization of the virus at the cell surface. HCV-associated lipoproteins may therefore be a promising target {{for the development of}} new therapeutic approaches...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background An {{effective}} vaccine and new therapeutic {{methods for}} hepatitis C virus (HCV) are needed, and a potent HCV vaccine must induce robust and sustained cellular-mediated immunity (CMI). Research {{has indicated that}} adenoviral and vaccinia vectors may {{have the ability to}} elicit strong B and T cell immune responses to target antigens. Results A recombinant replication-defective adenovirus serotype 5 (rAd 5) vector, rAd 5 -CE 1 E 2, and a recombinant Tian Tan vaccinia vector, rTTV-CE 1 E 2, were constructed to express the HCV CE 1 E 2 gene (1 - 746 amino acid HCV 1 b subtype). Mice were prime-immunised with rAd 5 -CE 1 E 2 delivered via intramuscular injection (i. m.), intranasal injection (i. n.), or intradermal injection (i. d.) and boosted using a different combination of injection routes. CMI was evaluated via IFN-γ ELISPOT and ICS 2 weeks after immunisation, or 16 weeks after boost for long-term responses. The humoral response was analysed by ELISA. With the exception of priming by i. n. injection, a robust CMI response against multiple HCV antigens (core, E 1, E 2) was elicited and remained at a high level for a long period (16 weeks post-vaccination) in mice. However, i. n. priming elicited the highest <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibody</b> levels. Priming with i. d. rAd 5 -CE 1 E 2 and boosting with i. d. rTTV-CE 1 E 2 carried out simultaneously enhanced CMI and the humoral immune response, compared to the homologous rAd 5 -CE 1 E 2 immune groups. All regimens demonstrated equivalent cross-protective potency in a heterologous surrogate challenge assay based on a recombinant HCV (JFH 1, 2 a) vaccinia virus. Conclusions Our data suggest that a rAd 5 -CE 1 E 2 -based HCV vaccine would be capable of eliciting an effective immune response and cross-protection. These findings have important implications for the development of T cell-based HCV vaccine candidates. </p...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{relationship}} between serum antibodies to the cross-reactive endotoxin core of Escherichia coli and survival following Pseudomonas aeruginosa septicemia. Core glycolipid was purified from the outer cell membrane of a uridine diphosphate galactose 4 -epimerase-deficient rough mutant E. coli (J 5 strain), characterized, and used as the antigen in a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure core-specific IgG and IgM antibodies. 43 patients with Pseudomonas septicemia, among whom there was a mortality of 42 %, were evaluated. Core-specific antibody concentrations in acute sera ranged from 1 to 49 micrograms/ml {{in the case of}} IgG and from 1 to 200 micrograms/ml for IgM. Core-specific antibodies of both isotypes were higher in patients who survived compared with those who succumbed to their septicemias (mean, microgram/ml +/- SEM, 26 +/- 3 vs. 14 +/- 4, P = 0. 005 for IgG, and 55 +/- 12 vs. 18 +/- 5, P = 0. 009 for IgM). Although total IgG levels were also higher in acute sera from survivors compared with nonsurvivors (mean, mg/dl +/- SEM, 1, 120 +/- 99 vs. 694 +/- 119, P = 0. 004), total IgM levels were virtually identical in the two groups (146 +/- 23 vs. 148 +/- 48, P = 0. 52). Conversely, patients with core-specific IgG levels greater than 10 micrograms/ml at the onset of septicemia had better survival than those with levels less than 10 micrograms/ml (79 vs. 14 %, P less than 0. 001), and patients with core-specific IgM levels greater than 30 micrograms/ml had better survival than those with levels less than 30 micrograms/ml (81 vs. 44 %, P = 0. 01). In comparison, patients with total IgG levels greater than 1, 000 mg/dl also had better survival than those with levels less than 1, 000 mg/dl (82 vs. 42 %, P = 0. 01), while those with total IgM levels greater than 150 mg/dl showed somewhat less improvement in survival compared with those with levels less than 150 mg/dl (71 vs. 50 %, P = 0. 12). Core-specific IgM was highly correlated with core-specific IgG (r = 0. 52), but not with type-specific anti-lipopolysaccharide (r = 0. 13) or anti-toxin A (r = 0. 12) antibodies, or with total IgG (r = 0. 28) or IgM (r = 0. 31). In contrast, core-specific IgG correlated somewhat more closely with type-specific antibodies (r = 0. 36), and with total IgG (r = 0. 51) and IgM (r = 0. 52). Stepwise linear discriminant analysis indicated that type-specific antibody levels were the best predictor of outcome, among those antibodies examined, followed by anti-core IgM. Although anti-core IgG, anti-toxin A, and total IgG levels all correlated individually with survival, none augmented the prognostic power of type-specific antibodies in combination with anti-core IgM, which together predicted outcome accurately 73. 5 % of the time. Host factors not significantly associated with <b>anti-core</b> <b>antibody</b> levels included rapidly fatal underlying disease, age, sex, leukopenia, and prior treatment with cytotoxic drugs. In contrast, prior steroid therapy was associated with low levels of both core-specific IgG and IgM (P < 0. 05). These data suggest cross-protective activity against P. aeruginosa septicemia of naturally occurring antibodies to the endotoxin core of E. coli. Anti-core antibodies, particularly of the IgM isotype appear to augment the more specific protective immunity engendered by antibodies to the O-specific side chains of Pseudomonas lipopolysaccharides. This cross-protective immunity likely applies to other Gram-negative pathogens as well...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{characteristics}} of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the high incidence of persistent infection. HCV core protein, in addition to forming the viral nucleocapsid, has multiple regulatory functions in host-cell transcrip-tion, apoptosis, cell transformation, and lipid metabolism and {{may play a role in}} suppressing host immune response. This protein is thought to be present in the bloodstream of the infected host as the nucleocapsid of infectious, enveloped virions. This study provides evidence that viral particles with the physicochemical, morphological, and antigenic properties of nonenveloped HCV nucleocapsids are present in the plasma of HCV-infected individuals. These particles have a buoyant density of 1. 32 to 1. 34 g/ml in CsCl, are heteroge-neous in size (with predominance of particles 38 to 43 or 54 to 62 nm in diameter on electron microscopy), and express on their surface epitopes located in amino acids 24 to 68 of the core protein. Similar nucleocapsid-like particles are also produced in insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus bearing cDNA for structural HCV proteins. HCV core particles isolated from plasma were used to generate <b>anti-core</b> monoclonal <b>antibodies</b> (MAbs).

Dois grupos de pacientes em tratamento hemodialítico foram avaliados quanto às respostas de anticorpos contra as proteínas não estrutural c 100 / 3 (anti-c 100 / 3) e estrutural core (anti-HCV core) do vírus da hepatite C (HCV). Quarenta e seis pacientes (Grupo 1) nunca apresentaram alterações dos níveis de alanina aminotransferase (ALT) durante o tratamento hemodialítico, ao passo que 52 pacientes (Grupo 2) têm ou já tiveram elevações desta enzima hepática. Em pacientes sem alterações bioquímicas evidentes (Grupo 1) foram encontradas prevalências de 32. 6 % e 41. 3 % para anti-c 100 / 3 e anti-HCV core, respectivamente. No Grupo 2, estas prevalências foram de 71, 15 % e 86, 5 %. Um teste composto de peptídeos estruturais e não estruturais imobilizados separadamente e dispostos em bandas paralelas em fitas de nailon, foi usado como teste confirmatório.
