50|$|The {{suspension}} system uses Land Rover Discovery beam <b>axles</b> <b>front</b> and rear. The <b>front</b> <b>axles</b> are located by radius rods and a Panhard rod. The rear axle is located by trailing arms and Watt's linkage.|$|R
50|$|In general, Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axles</b> are uncommon, due to {{attributes}} that the Dana 60 <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> can match. The main advantage a Dana 70 <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> has over a Dana 60 <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> is better gross axle weight ratings.|$|R

5000|$|Transverse {{leaf spring}} and solid <b>axle</b> <b>front</b> {{suspension}} of early Ford cars {{is a type}} of automotive front suspension that has been most common in early Ford Motor Company products. [...] "Suicide front axle" [...] is a term that has been used for it.|$|E
50|$|Braking is {{achieved}} by a disc brake mounted on the rear <b>axle.</b> <b>Front</b> disc brakes are used in most shifter kart classes and are increasingly popular in other classes; however, certain classes do not allow them. Shifter karts have dual master cylinders, one for the front {{and one for the}} rear and are adjustable to allow for front/ rear bias changes.|$|E
50|$|For 1959, Ballamy {{developed}} two ladder chassis {{which used}} a semi-swing <b>axle</b> <b>front</b> suspension featuring Citroën 2CV-style leading arms. At the rear was a transverse double cantilever layout. The ‘A’ model chassis suited Ford side valve engines while the ‘B’ model was for Ford overhead valve and BMC B-series motors. Various proprietary specials shells could be fitted. Only {{two of these}} chassis {{are known to have}} survived.|$|E
50|$|The {{drum brakes}} {{operated}} {{on all four}} wheels. Suspension was traditional, involving rigid <b>axles</b> <b>front</b> and back with semi-elliptic leaf springs and “friction dampers”.|$|R
50|$|The chassis had beam <b>axles</b> <b>front</b> {{and rear}} and {{suspension}} by half elliptic leaf springs and hydraulic dampers. The brakes used a Lockheed hydraulic system.|$|R

50|$|The GM 9.25 IFS {{has been}} the main front {{differential}} in Four-wheel drive 3/4 Ton and 1 Ton GM trucks since 1988. The Dana 60 solid <b>axle</b> <b>front</b> end was used selectively in trucks with a higher GVWR from 1988-1991. The original Saginaw 9.5 differential, ring and pinion were modified {{to work with the}} independent front suspension. The ring and pinion were also reverse-cut as well.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} engine had 110 hp (82 kW) {{and gave}} the car {{a top speed of}} 90 mph.Suspension was Henry Ford-era transverse springs front and rear, with dead <b>axle</b> <b>front</b> and torque tube rear, already quite outdated when the car was introduced. Brakes were cable-activated for 1936 to 1938; 1939 and onwards were hydraulic. The Zephyr was the first Ford product to have an all-steel roof, except the late 1931 Model AA truck.|$|E
5000|$|The 4wd F150 {{continued}} {{the use of}} the Dana 44 Twin-Traction Beam axle from the 80-91 trucks, and the Ford 8.8" [...] Rear Straight axle. The 4wd F250 carried the Dana 50 Twin Traction Beam axle, the Sterling 10.25 from the previous generation for the rear; full float on heavy duty 3/4 ton trucks and the 4wd F350 used the Dana 60 Straight <b>Axle</b> <b>front,</b> and the Sterling 10.25" [...] rear Straight axle.|$|E

50|$|The drawbar {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the fifth wheel coupling. The drawbar requires a trailer which either loads the drawbar lightly (for example a small boat trailer, or caravan, where a load of up to ~50 kg is part of correct trailer loading practice), or the load is the weight of the coupling components only (larger trailers, usually but not always with a steerable hauled <b>axle,</b> <b>front</b> or rear). By contrast, the fifth wheel is designed to transmit a major proportion of the load's weight to the hauling vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|Normally a {{front-wheel drive}} vehicle (except Vanagon, see above).In normal driving conditions, 95% of torque is {{transferred}} to front axle. Because viscous coupling {{is considered to be}} [...] "slow" [...] (some time is needed for silicone fluid to warm-up and solidify), 5% of torque {{is transferred to}} rear axle at all times to [...] "pre-tension" [...] the viscous coupling and reduce activation time. The coupling locks when slipping occurs and up to near 50% of torque is automatically transferred to rear <b>axle</b> (<b>front</b> in Vanagon). In on-road conditions, the car will not move if one front wheel and one rear wheel lose traction.|$|E
5000|$|This layout, {{similar to}} above FMR layout, with engine between driver and behind <b>front</b> <b>axle,</b> adds <b>front</b> wheel drive {{to become a}} four-wheel drive.|$|R
50|$|The {{body was}} built in the {{traditional}} method of aluminium panels fixed to a wooden framework. The suspension used leaf springs and was non independent with rigid <b>axles</b> <b>front</b> and rear. The brakes were mechanically operated.|$|R
50|$|Key {{products}} include <b>axles,</b> drive shafts, <b>front</b> <b>axle,</b> {{universal joints}} and sealing and thermal-management products.|$|R
50|$|A {{properly}} equipped C-Series half-ton class pickup could tow up to 8,000 lbs (4 tons) of braked trailer, while {{a properly}} equipped C-Series three quarter-ton or one-ton class pickup could tow up to 12,000 lbs (6 tons) of braked trailer. Adding four-wheel drive reduced towing capability {{due to increased}} curb weight, which resulted from additional driveline components (transfer case, front <b>axle,</b> <b>front</b> differential, front propeller shaft, and so on) needed to facilitate four-wheel drive. A properly equipped K-Series half-ton or three quarter-ton class pickup could tow up to 6,500 lbs (3.25 tons) of braked trailer, whilst a properly equipped K-Series one-ton class pickup could tow 500 lbs more, up to 7,000 lbs (3.5 tons) of braked trailer.|$|E
5000|$|The Continental Cowley, {{shown to}} the press in April 1915, was a larger engined (1495 cc against 1018 cc), longer, wider and better {{equipped}} version of the first Morris Oxford with the same [...] "Bullnose" [...] radiator; in addition it could carry a four-passenger body. To reduce the price many components were bought from United States suppliers. The 1495 cc, side valve, four cylinder engine was made by Continental Motor Manufacturing Company of Detroit, and the clutch and three speed gearbox by Detroit Gear & Machine Co. Back <b>axle,</b> <b>front</b> axle and steering gear also came from the USA. Supply of these components was badly affected by World War I. The suspension used semi elliptic leaf springs at the front and three quarter elliptics at the rear.|$|E
5000|$|The Styrofoam {{model was}} {{used to create a}} steel [...] "test frame", which had to stand up to several standards: have a speed of over 100 mph, go from 0 to 60 mi/h km/h in 5 seconds, possess a {{steering}} system to make sharp turns at city corners, and to withstand a self-propelled launch of up to 30 ft. On the first jump test, the Tumbler's front end collapsed and had to be completely rebuilt. The basic configuration of the newly designed vehicle included a 5.7-liter Chevy V8 engine, a truck axle for the rear <b>axle,</b> <b>front</b> racing tires by Hoosier, rear 4×4 mud tires by Interco., and the suspension system of Baja racing trucks. The design and development process took nine months and cost several million dollars.|$|E
50|$|The LT was {{equipped}} with a <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> with independent <b>front</b> wheel suspension. Later options, such as the heavy LT 40 to LT 55, had a solid <b>front</b> <b>axle</b> to achieve increased to load-carrying capacity as is common for light trucks.|$|R
50|$|The 105 {{carried over}} the {{majority}} of its chassis and powertrain from the 80-series with coil suspended solid <b>axles</b> <b>front</b> and rear, and straight-6 petrol and diesel engines. These models were only sold in African, Australian, Russian, and South American markets.|$|R
