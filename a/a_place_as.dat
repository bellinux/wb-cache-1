25|$|A lower-order {{right-handed}} batsman and a fast-medium right-handed bowler, Cowie played first-class cricket for Auckland {{from the}} 1932-33 season, appearing regularly in Plunket Shield matches from 1934-35.

The teachers ranked her 14th in tragedy and second in comedy. Once again, Morny came to her rescue. He put in a good word for her with the National Minister of the Arts, Camille Doucet.
