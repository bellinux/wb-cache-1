5|$|In clock-limited sports, games {{often end}} with a team that holds the lead killing the clock rather than {{competing}} aggressively against the opposing team. In contrast, baseball has no clock; a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time. At almost any turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy. In contrast, again, the clock comes into play even {{in the case of}} multi-day Test and first-class cricket: the possibility of a draw often encourages <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> batting last and well behind to bat defensively, giving up any faint chance at a win to avoid a loss. Baseball offers no such reward for conservative batting.|$|E
25|$|For <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{losing a}} game, a fresh striker can bring more benefit in {{circumventing}} an opposed defence line composed of relatively tired players. For <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> winning a game, a fresh midfielder or a defender can bring more benefit in strengthening the defence against the opposition's attackers (who may be fresh substitutes themselves). In this situation, {{it is usually}} imaginative attacking flair players who are replaced by tough-tackling defensive midfielders or defenders.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> losing {{by one or}} {{two goals}} {{in the last few}} minutes of play will often elect to pull the goalie; that is, remove the goaltender and replace him or her with an extra {{attacker}} on the ice in the hope of gaining enough advantage to score a goal. However, it is an act of desperation, as it sometimes leads to the opposing team extending their lead by scoring a goal in the empty net.|$|E

25|$|The Yale Inter-Varsity Debate Tournament is {{an annual}} {{international}} debate tournament {{for college students}} held in British Parliamentary (BP) style. It was first held in 2006.

25|$|Allows <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{over the}} cap {{to acquire a}} {{replacement}} for a disabled player who will be out for either the remainder of that season (for in-season injuries/deaths) or the next season (if the disability occurs during the offseason). The maximum salary of the replacement player is either 50% of the injured player's salary, or the mid-level exception for a non-taxpaying team, whichever is less. This exception requires an NBA-designated doctor to verify {{the extent of the}} injury. Under the 2005 CBA, a team could sign a player under this exception for five years; since the 2011 CBA, it has been allowed only for one year.|$|E
25|$|Led by coach Béla Guttmann, Benfica {{were one}} of two teams, along with Barcelona, to break Real Madrid's {{dominance}} in the European Champion Clubs' Cup by winning two consecutive European Cup titles, the first one against Barcelona in 1961 (3–2) and the second one against Real Madrid in 1962 (5–3). Later on, Benfica reached another three European Cup finals but lost them to Milan in 1963, to Inter Milan in 1965, and to Manchester United in 1968 at the Wembley Stadium, where they were presented with European Team of the Year by France Football. The 1960s were the best period of the club, in which Benfica won eight Primeira Liga (1959–60, 1960–61, 1962–63, 1963–64, 1964–65, 1966–67, 1967–68, 1968–69), three Taça de Portugal (1962, 1964, 1969) and two European Cups (1960–61, 1961–62). Many of their successes in this decade were achieved with Eusébio– the only player to win the Ballon d'Or for a Portuguese club– Coluna, José Águas, José Augusto, Simões, Torres and other players, who formed the team of 1963–64 that set a club record of 103 goals in 26 league matches, <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{regarded as one of}} the best in world football. During the 1960s, Benfica was ranked first in European football three times (in 1965, 1966 and 1969).|$|E

2500|$|The {{paradox is}} {{sometimes}} re-stated as [...] "commercial sporting organizations need close competition {{if they are}} to be able to maximize their income", as a result of Neale's further conclusion that [...] "demand for competition will decrease if the spectators can predict the outcome of the game". However, this has been challenged by Roger G. Noll, who noted in the Oxford Review of Economic Policy in 2003 that [...] "a team that has dropped out of contentions for a championship will generally draw poorly, but it is likely to sell more tickets if it is playing <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> at or near that top of the standings than if it is playing another weak team, even though the outcome of the latter game is more uncertain".|$|E

2500|$|In {{his role}} as manager, Zimmer took over a team that had {{finished}} in seventh place in 1902. [...] By the first of June 1903, the Phillies were struggling with an 11-26 record. Zimmer at that time acknowledged that the [...] "task of managing a team that does not stand so well up in the race {{is not the most}} pleasant one in the world", but he insisted that he was not discouraged and noted that the greater satisfaction comes not from taking charge of a first-class team and keeping it going, but [...] "to take hold of <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> down in the race and bring it up to a high standard." [...] The Phillies did improve late in the season, compiling a 16-13 record in their last 29 games. However, with a seventh-place finish, the 1903 season was Zimmer's only one as a Major League manager. [...] In fairness to Zimmer, the Phillies simply lacked the talent to compete with the best teams in the National League, had finished in seventh place in 1902 under Bill Shettsline, and dropped to eighth place in 1904 under Hugh Duffy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{score of}} a cricket team whose innings is in {{progress}} is given {{as the number of}} runs they have scored [...] "for" [...] the number of wickets their opponents have taken. For example, a team that has scored 100 runs and lost three wickets has a score of [...] "one hundred for three", written 100–3 (also 100/3); The exception to this is in Australia, where it is conventional to reverse the wickets and runs scored, so that what would be written 100–3 elsewhere in the world is written and said 3–100 (or 3/100) in Australia. <b>A</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> dismissed having scored 300 runs is said to have a score of [...] "three hundred all out", rather than [...] "three hundred for ten"; the score for the innings is then simply written 300. However, if a team declare their innings closed (in a First-class match) or reach an over limit (in a limited-overs match), the number of wickets is included in their score for the innings, for example 275–7. A declaration is noted by appending a [...] "d" [...] or [...] "dec" [...] to the score (for example 300–8d); such a score is spoken in the standard form with the word [...] "declared" [...] appended (example: [...] "300 for 8, declared").|$|E
2500|$|The 2011 CBA instituted {{major changes}} to the luxury tax regime. The {{previous}} CBA had a dollar-for-dollar tax provision system, which remained in effect through the 2012–13 season. Teams exceeding the tax level were punished by being forced to pay one dollar to the league for each dollar by which their payroll exceeded the tax level. Starting in 2013–14, the tax changed to an incremental system. Under the current system, tax is assessed at different levels based on the amount that a team is over the luxury tax threshold. The scheme is not cumulative—each level of tax applies only to amounts over that level's threshold. For example, <b>a</b> <b>team</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> $8 million over the tax threshold will pay $1.50 for each of its first $5 million over the tax threshold, and $1.75 per dollar for the remaining $3 million. Starting in 2014–15, [...] "repeat offenders", subject to additional penalties, are defined as teams that paid tax in previous seasons. In the first season, repeat offenders from in all previous three seasons will pay a stiffer tax rate; from 2015–16 thereafter, teams paying taxes in {{three out of four}} years will be subject to the higher repeater rate. As in the previous CBA, the tax revenue is divided among teams with lower payrolls. However, under the new scheme, no more than 50% of the total tax revenue can go exclusively to teams that did not go over the cap. Initial reports did not specify the use of the remaining 50% under the 2011 CBA, but it was later confirmed that this amount would be used to fund revenue sharing for the season during which tax was paid.|$|E
