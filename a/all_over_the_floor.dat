500|$|Doggett {{manages to}} trick and subdue Tommy by pretending {{to set the}} house on fire. [...] He pours a {{canister}} of water <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and furniture, acting {{as if it is}} gasoline. [...] However, because Tommy believes it to be real, he sees Doggett pouring gasoline and lighting a match, and sees flames burn in the living room. [...] Tommy passes out in fear. [...] Tommy is eventually transported to a psychiatric ward, where his imagination is stifled by watching several televisions all at the same time.|$|E
500|$|Alfred Meldrew (Richard Pearson) - Victor's {{absent-minded}} brother, {{who lives}} in New Zealand. During the episode [...] "The Broken Reflection", he comes to visit after 25 years, to the disdain of Victor. Alfred is an eccentric character, often walking around with his hat on fire, and bringing over his and Victor's great-grandfather's skull. He is a clumsy character too, mistaking the table-cloth for a napkin and dropping the entire contents of the table <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> when he stands up, and breaking a mirror {{in the middle of}} the night after mistaking his own reflection for a burglar. Victor starts to warm to Alfred towards the end of his visit, but Alfred leaves early the next day after finding an unpleasant message about him that Victor had accidentally recorded on a dictaphone. He is not seen again, but keeps in touch with the Meldrews, as Victor is seen looking at some photographs Alfred had sent over in [...] "The Trial".|$|E
500|$|Mulder tells Scully his version. In his recollection, he is {{sensitive}} and polite to Scully, {{while she is}} dismissive and irritable, and clearly enamored with Sheriff Hartwell (who, in Mulder's version, is far less refined and has obvious buck teeth). While Scully is performing the autopsy, Mulder and Hartwell get a call {{to go to the}} local RV park, where there is [...] "a situation". They find another dead body, apparently a victim of the same attacker. Mulder returns to the motel room; after Scully has left, he eats her pizza and realizes that he has been drugged. Ronnie enters, with glowing green eyes, and prepares to attack Mulder, but Mulder manages to postpone his demise by scattering sunflower seeds <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> which Ronnie compulsively starts to pick up. Scully enters and shoots Ronnie, but the bullets have no effect, and Ronnie runs out with Scully in pursuit. Mulder recovers from being drugged and chases after Ronnie.|$|E
2500|$|A {{theatrical}} production {{based on}} his work was produced at Duke University in the early 1990s. Directed by Johnny Simons, and co-starring Avner Eisenberg and Nicholas de Wolff, {{the development of the}} play was supervised by Crumb, who also served as set designer, drawing larger-than-life representations of some of his most famous characters <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> and walls of the set.|$|R

2500|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to rein in the}} excess of the upper classes, the Zen masters {{introduced}} the tea ceremony. In architecture this promoted the design of chashitsu (tea houses) to a modest size with simple detailing and materials. The style informed residential architecture with lighter, more intimate buildings relying on slender rafters and pillars with sliding inner partitions fusuma and outer sliding walls shōji [...] Although woven grass and straw tatami mats first began to appear in the Kamakura period, they were often thrown <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> In the Muromachi period they began to have a regular size and be closely fitted together. A typically sized Chashitsu is 4 1/2 mats in size.|$|E
2500|$|With {{such great}} capital spent on publicity, Zachary and Rosenthal decided Portfolio {{would have to}} include advertising. Upon seeing the advertisements, however, they {{could not bear to}} ruin {{the look and feel of}} the {{publication}} by running them. It was decided that Portfolio would run without the aesthetic burden of advertising, freeing up more space for the overall design. Brodovitch was responsible for sorting through the articles and illustrations to create the spreads. Zachary described watching Brodovitch in action: He'd go through the stuff fast, really fast, and pick out always the right thing, you know, and then he would mark it up , an inch, inch and a half, two and a half inches... But anyhow, I'd go back to see him, he'd have these dam 'stats <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> ankle deep in them, and he would look around, pick one up, until there were six or eight or ten and then he'd lay them out and it worked... that was the magic of it, you know?" ...|$|E

50|$|Binaliw Isle: Located in Brgy. Maguino-o, Tinambacan District, Calbayog City, it is {{separated}} from the mainland by the Silangan Channel. A potential deep diving spot, about 40 to 50 meters from the water surface and measuring less than a hectare in area. The islet is surrounded with aquifers equally and uniformly spread at the peripheral limits of the islet with white sand and pebbles. Beneath the deep waters are sea corals of multifarious varieties, rare white pebbles spread <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floors,</b> 20 types of shells, and ornamental types of aquamarine species - which can all be explored by the diver {{for as long as}} in his underwater gear.|$|R

5000|$|Walkowitz {{was drawn}} to art from childhood. In a 1958 oral {{interview}} with Abram Lerner, he recalled: [...] "When I was a kid, about five years old, I used to draw with chalk, <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> and everything... I suppose it's in me. I remember myself as a little boy, of three or four, taking chalk and made drawings." [...] In early adulthood, {{he worked as a}} sign painter and began making sketches of immigrants in New York's Jewish ghetto where he lived with his mother. He continued to pursue his formal training, and with funds from a friend traveled to Europe in 1906 to attend the Académie Julian. Through introductions made by Max Weber, it was here that he met Isadora Duncan in Auguste Rodin's studio, the modern American dancer who had captured the attention of the avant-garde. Walkowitz went on to produce more than 5,000 drawings of Duncan.|$|R

60|$|They {{then went}} into the barn and brought out a {{quantity}} of hay, and sprinkled it <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of the hen-house, which made the apartment look extremely neat and comfortable. They then brought out another fork-full of hay and pitched it up upon the loft.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a general}} {{scrambling}} up <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> and Edgar rushed across to light a candle. Wilmet alone had not stirred, as Bernard lay asleep across her lap. The flash of the match revealed a mass of light disordered heads, and likewise a black figure in the doorway.|$|E
50|$|There were so {{many things}} that he hadn't noticed about the place Café de la Gare. The scum who threw up and urinated, regularly, <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> toilet <b>floor.</b> <b>The</b> early starts, late finishes, the guys who had never had enough. Seven nights a week. Fifty-two weeks of the year. But there was no turning back. He would make it work. It was sink or swim.|$|R
6000|$|Alas! {{that was}} no refuge. She had been too much tired to hear {{anything}} the night before, but to-night there was scratching, nibbling, careering, fighting, squeaking, recoil and rally, charge and rout, as the grey Hanover rat fought his successful battle with his black English cousin <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> and stairs--nay, once or twice came rushing up and <b>over</b> <b>the</b> bed--frightening its occupant almost out of her senses, as she cowered under the bed-clothes, {{not at all sure}} that they would not proceed to eating her. Happily daylight came early. Aurelia, at its first ray, darted across the room, starting in horror when she touched a soft thing with her bare foot, opened the shutter, and threw open the casement. Light drove the enemy back to their holes, and she had a few hours' sleep, but when Mrs. Loveday came to the room when she was nearly dressed, she exclaimed, [...] "Why, miss, you look paler than you did yesterday." ...|$|R
5000|$|Returning in {{the spring}} of 2008 he rented out a small {{apartment}} to start his very own MMA training gym in his home town calling it The Slaughter House,inside the makeshift gym were mats made out of tarp and carpet pads. His students were the same children he trained when he visited Pakistan in 2007. Others from the martial arts community took notice when he started showing Pride and UFC fights explaining MMA was the evolution of combat sports. This served as the first MMA training centre in the country, the gym ran till the spring of 2009 until Bashir Ahmad left his home town to promote MMA in the major cities of the country. [...] "I rented this small place above a restaurant. It was a nasty, filthy restaurant. There was grease <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floors.</b> It was disgusting. I got it for fifty dollars a month and nicknamed the place 'The Slaughterhouse' because it was so filthy." ...|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} Professor Lemm {{had managed to}} regain his feet a second time, but the broken sheets of ice were now <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of his room, and just as he managed {{to turn on the}} lights he slipped once more, this time sending a chair {{spinning}} against the closet door.|$|E

'What are you doing there?' asked the mother.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{suppose it}} might, miss; it be sharp {{sometimes}} outside. Why, there is oilcloth <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> and a mat to wipe one's {{feet at the}} bottom of the ladder, and a rug by the side of the bed! I never did see such things. Bill must have gone clean off his chump. Well, I am blessed!" ...|$|E
50|$|Roscommon County Council {{purchased}} {{the building in}} 1987 and began a restoration project in 1989 following years of neglect. Using artisans and local craftsmen who employed traditional techniques and materials, <b>the</b> three <b>floors</b> and basement were restored. Included in the restoration were the main entrance gallery with its tripate windows and original fireplace, the vaulted ceilings on all <b>floors,</b> and <b>the</b> main salon which is in use again as a venue for recitals and banquets. The other rooms in the house are used for temporary exhibitions and these are open to visitors. In The Kings of Connaught exhibition, visitors are led {{through a series of}} tableaux. <b>The</b> displays, ranging <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floors,</b> cover four main themes: The Kingdom of Connaught - from the earliest recorded times showing the importance of the clans and their kings; The King Family - meet the families who lived in the house from Sir John King who came to Boyle in 1603 to the fascinating accounts of life, both for the family and the staff, at Rockingham Estate (now Lough Key Forest Park); The Restoration - a room left partially restored so that visitors can see the fabric of the house.|$|R
60|$|Lane {{experienced}} an indefinable thrill at the scene. The air seemed to reek with a mixed perfume and cigarette smoke--to resound with high-keyed youthful laughter, wild and sweet and vacant above the strange, discordant music. Then the flashing, changing, whirling {{colors of the}} dancers struck Lane as oriental, erotic, bizarre--gorgeous golds and greens and reds striped by the conventional black. Suddenly the blare ceased, and the shrill, trilling laughter had dominance. The rapid circling of forms came to a sudden stop, and the dancers streamed in <b>all</b> directions <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|R
60|$|This silly dog had thrust {{its head}} up <b>the</b> hole <b>over</b> a fire {{such as the}} stops make outside the coverts when men are going to shoot, either to hide {{something}} or to look for me there. When it came down again because the Red-faced Man kicked it, the dog put its paws into the fire and pulled it <b>all</b> out <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> Also it howled very beautifully. Just then another hound, that one which generally led the pack, began to sniff about near me and finally poked its nose under the stuff which hid me.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, please, a {{few minutes}} more," [...] began Kitty, but was off like a flash; for the shoes trotted her upstairs so fast that she ran against old Nursey, and down she went, {{splashing}} the water <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> and scolding in such a funny way that it made Kitty laugh {{so that she could}} hardly pick her up again.|$|E
60|$|Yes, by the way, {{there was}} one other {{drawback}} to the otherwise picturesque and interesting group, {{and this was the}} spitting propensity of <b>the</b> Yankees. <b>All</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> floor--that <b>floor,</b> too, on which other men besides themselves were to repose--they discharged tobacco-juice and spittle. The nation cannot be too severely blamed and pitied for this disgusting practice, yet we feel a tendency, not to excuse, but to deal gently with individuals, most of whom, having been trained to spitting from their infancy, cannot be expected even to understand the abhorrence with which the practice is regarded by men of other nations.|$|R
50|$|After {{the end of}} his NFL career, he {{appeared}} at ringside in the WWF for Lawrence Taylor at WrestleMania XI on April 2, 1995 in Hartford, Connecticut. Taylor was wrestling Bam Bam Bigelow and there were several football players at ringside to keep wrestlers from interfering in the match. During a previous episode Monday Night Raw, McMichael provided guest commentary with Vince McMahon and would later brawl with Kama Mustafa, one of Bigelow's comrades. <b>The</b> fight was <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> arena <b>floor</b> and almost into <b>the</b> stands, knocking <b>over</b> <b>the</b> broadcast table, soon being broken up by personnel. Taylor ended up winning the later match.|$|R
5000|$|The San Juan de Dios Church {{still stands}} as the silent witness of the bloody battles that the Filipino insurgents fought during the Philippine Revolution of 1896. This church was used as {{military}} barracks for almost three days, after the insurgents had destroyed all papers and documents they found in the convents. When the Spanish Cazadores learned of these rebellious activities, they entered the church and fought the insurgents. [...] The combatants fought heavily inside the church {{to a point that}} blood was spilled <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> church <b>floor.</b> <b>The</b> patio in front of the church was littered by dead bodies of Filipino insurgents. The gobernadorcillo ordered people to dig a common grave near the church for the bodies of the insurgents.|$|R

See how I had to tear my pajamas to get him out?" [...] and he showed the spot.|$|E
60|$|The {{other young}} man was {{occupied}} busily in collecting coral beads which were scattered <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of the room, and as he picked them up he placed them on the same table where his brother was sitting. He had already gathered together ninety-eight beads, and thought they were all there, when they suddenly rolled {{off the table and}} he had to begin his work over again.|$|E
60|$|Wid that we wint aff to the widdy's, next door, and ye {{may well}} {{say it was}} an illigant place; so it was.

6000|$|Suddenly the {{henhouse}} {{door was}} thrown open and Farmer Brown's boy stepped inside. In his hand {{he held a}} pan filled with the breakfast he had brought for the hens. Suddenly a box in the darkest corner of the henhouse moved. Farmer Brown's boy turned to look, and {{as he did so}} a slim form dashed fairly between his legs. It startled him so that he dropped the pan and spilled <b>the</b> corn <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> henhouse <b>floor.</b> [...] "Great Scott!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "What under the sun was that?" [...] and rushed to the door to see. He was just in time {{to get a glimpse of}} a red coat and a bushy tail disappearing around a corner of the barn.|$|R
50|$|One {{evening after}} Martha had not {{appeared}} for classes or meals all day, her former roommate, the dormitory president, had a guilty feeling {{and decided to}} go see her, thinking that this time {{she might be able}} to help Martha in some way. As she neared Martha's room at an isolated corridor at <b>the</b> top <b>floor</b> of <b>the</b> building, she is said to have noticed flashes of red shooting out into the corridor from the room's transom. Opening the door, she screamed and fainted. Girls from <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> fourth <b>floor</b> of Pratt rushed from their rooms to see what was wrong. Martha, or so the story goes, was found on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of her room, dressed in her red robe and draped in her red bedspread, having committed suicide by slashing her wrists.|$|R
5000|$|For the {{recording}} of Dopesick, Eyehategod's third album, Williams went through several issues. At {{the time he was}} living in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn in New York City so he had to travel between there and New Orleans, Louisiana frequently for {{the recording}} sessions, which took place at Side One Studios. He attempted to record the sound of smashing glass for the introduction to the album, by smashing a bottle on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of <b>the</b> studio. In the process he slashed his hand open badly and bled <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> studio <b>floor.</b> One of <b>the</b> band members then apparently smeared the words [...] "Hell" [...] and [...] "Death to Pigs" [...] in his blood. The studio owner reportedly called Century Media to ask if the band were insane, and threatened to kick them out because of this.|$|R
