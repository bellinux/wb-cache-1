Compensation of the residually present hydroxyl ions in the oxygen sublattice by cation vacancies results in strains leading to metastable presence of the cubic phase at room temperature. Studies on the diffuse phase transition behaviour of these submicron powders show that the stable tetragonal phase is produced only on annealing at high temperatures where the mobility of cations vacancies are larger. Heat-treatment reduces anisotropy and strain in undoped samples, whereas annealing is less effective in doped materials.

30|$|From the {{development}} of Ga 2 O 3, this material still has some disadvantages as follows. (1) P-type doping is a big challenge of Ga 2 O 3 material. Because the acceptor levels are far from the valence band of β-Ga 2 O 3, the activation energy of <b>acceptor</b> <b>impurities</b> is very high. Meanwhile, the n-type background impurities in Ga 2 O 3 crystal will also produce self-compensation effect on <b>acceptor</b> <b>impurities,</b> resulting to the self-insulating of the material. Therefore, there still has been no effective p-type doing. (2) The thermal conductivity of Ga 2 O 3 is too low. Experimental and theoretical investigations have proved that the thermal conductivity of β-Ga 2 O 3 is just only 0.1 – 0.3  W cm− 1  K− 1 [51 – 53]. This is adverse to the power device used in high-voltage and high-current circumstance. Excessive heat accumulation will seriously affect the performance and reliability of the device. (3) Carrier mobility is low. The theoretical mobility of Ga 2 O 3 is limited to about 200  cm 2 /V s due {{to the influence of}} scattering [54]. Low mobility has a negative impact on the frequency and current characteristics.|$|R

The variation of the electronic structures and binding energy with the QD structure parameters and the position of the impurity are studied in detail. We find that (1) <b>acceptor</b> <b>impurity</b> energy levels depend more sensitively {{on the size of the}} QD than those of a donor impurity; (2) all impurity energy levels strongly depend on the GaAs quantum well (QW) width; (3) a donor impurity in the QD has only one binding energy level except when the GaAs QW is large; (4) an <b>acceptor</b> <b>impurity</b> in the QD has two binding energy levels, which correspond to heavy- and light-hole quantum states; (5) the binding energy has a maximum value when the impurity is located below the symmetry axis along the growth direction; and (6) the binding energy has a minimum value when the impurity is located at the top corner of the QD.
