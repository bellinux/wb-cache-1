5|$|Newer {{aircraft}} designs {{such as the}} McDonnell Douglas MD-11 {{have incorporated}} hydraulic fuses to isolate a punctured section and prevent a total loss of hydraulic fluid. Following the UAL 232 accident, such fuses were installed in the number 3 hydraulic system in the area below the number 2 engine on all DC-10 aircraft to ensure sufficient control capability remained if all three hydraulic system lines should be damaged in the tail area. Although elevator and rudder control would be lost, the aircrew would still be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the aircraft's pitch (up and down) with stabilizer trim, and would be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> roll (left and right) {{with some of the}} aircraft's ailerons and spoilers. Although not an ideal situation, the system provides a greater measure of control than was available to the crew of United 232.|$|E

5|$|A few insects, such {{as members}} of the {{families}} Poduridae and Onychiuridae (Collembola), Mycetophilidae (Diptera) and the beetle families Lampyridae, Phengodidae, Elateridae and Staphylinidae are bioluminescent. The most familiar group are the fireflies, beetles of the family Lampyridae. Some species are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> this light generation to produce flashes. The function varies with some species using them to attract mates, while others use them to lure prey. Cave dwelling larvae of Arachnocampa (Mycetophilidae, fungus gnats) glow to lure small flying insects into sticky strands of silk.|$|E
5|$|A graphic {{description}} of the nuckelavee as it appears on land was given by an islander {{who claimed to have}} had a confrontation with it, but accounts describing the details of the creature's appearance are inconsistent. In common with many other sea monsters it is unable to tolerate fresh water, therefore those it is pursuing have only to cross a river or stream to be rid of it. The nuckelavee is kept in confinement during the summer months by the Mither o' the Sea, an ancient Orcadian spirit, and the only one <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> it.|$|E
5|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review of}} Srigala Item in the Surabaya-based daily Soerabaijasch Handelsblad was positive, predicting the film {{would be a}} commercial success. This prediction was fulfilled, as Srigala Item reached extensive audiences– mostly lower-class natives. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran credits this success to escapism. He writes that the film's theme of an oppressed, financially destitute youth who is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> his destiny by becoming a masked vigilante, allowed viewers {{to be able to}} see themselves as the Black Wolf, and thus take revenge against those who had wronged them.|$|E

Goldwater carried six states: Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina and his home state of Arizona. Goldwater's strong showing in the south is largely due to his support of the white southern view on civil rights: that states should be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> their own laws without federal intervention.|$|E

5|$|The {{female worker}} ants {{do not have}} wings and {{reproductive}} females lose their wings after their mating flights in order to begin their colonies. Therefore, unlike their wasp ancestors, most ants travel by walking. Some species are capable of leaping. For example, Jerdon's jumping ant (Harpegnathos saltator) is able to jump by synchronising the action of its mid and hind pairs of legs. There are several species of gliding ant including Cephalotes atratus; {{this may be a}} common trait among most arboreal ants. Ants with this ability are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the direction of their descent while falling.|$|E

In 1949 international pressure on the Netherlands became such that, together with the existing partial military stalemate, it recognised Indonesian independence.|$|E
5|$|To further {{improve the}} {{function}} of heterodimeric antibodies, many scientists are looking towards artificial constructs.

Although the device temporarily malfunctions, he ultimately defeats the bodyguard. The scene concludes with Grilka and Quark alone and enamored with one another. Worf opines to Jadzia that Quark is unworthy of such a great Klingon woman, and she counters that Worf's interest in Grilka is superficial, asserting that there are better options awaiting him. Observing that Worf still fails to see the subtext in her hints, Dax initiates an aggressive romantic encounter. In the next scene, both couples are shown in the infirmary; Doctor Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) treats their wounds and quickly deduces {{the source of their}} injuries.|$|E
5|$|During the Han, {{the empire}} {{was divided into}} large {{administrative}} units of kingdoms and commanderies; within a commandery there were counties, and within counties there were districts that contained at least several hamlets. An average hamlet contained about a hundred families and usually was enclosed by a wall with two gates. At the center of social life in the hamlet was the religious altar (built in honor of a local deity) where festivities could be staged. Each district and county also had an official religious altar. The official reach of government extended {{no further than the}} district level, where county-appointed officials included the chief of police who maintained law and order and the district tax collector. However, the government was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> local society at the hamlet level with their bestowal of twenty ranks.|$|E
5|$|Forest Hill {{was a new}} air base, {{and roads}} and {{buildings}} were still under construction when its first course of flying training commenced with Avro Ansons on 29July 1940. One of the Ansons crashed in August, killing its instructor and a student. Later that month the second flying course began, on CAC Wirraways. The school was then reorganised into Initial and Advanced Squadrons. On 29September, two Ansons collided in mid-air and became locked together. Both navigators bailed out, to be followed shortly afterwards by the injured pilot of the lower aircraft. The pilot of the upper Anson, however, {{found that he was}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the interlocked aircraft using his ailerons and flaps, coupled with the engine power of the Anson underneath.

5|$|France hosted England at Colombes on 1 January 1908 for {{the third}} rugby {{encounter}} between the two nations. Although France lost the game 0–19, the press did not consider it a crushing defeat, given that on the previous occasions England had scored 35 points and then 41. During the first half, two French players departed the field injured, {{so that by the}} second half, England had the advantage in numbers and were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the game, which at the start had appeared (to the French press) to be well-balanced. The forwards were considered to be at least equal to, if not better, than the English. Guillemin and Duval amongst the forwards, as well as the backs Hubert and Moure, drew praise from Reichel.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, Casey became Chief Engineer at MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ), Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA). He faced {{enormous}} engineering challenges. Most of New Guinea {{consisted of}} mountains and jungle, {{with very few}} airstrips, ports or roads. All of these had to be developed to support operations. To provide additional expertise in construction, Casey had Leif Sverdrup assigned to his staff as chief of the Construction Section, with the rank of colonel. As U.S. Army engineers were few, Casey worked closely with his Australian Army counterpart at General Sir Thomas Blamey's Allied Land Forces headquarters, Major General Clive Steele. Construction activities in Australia were also undertaken by civilians of the Allied Works Council. Casey attempted to coordinate {{the activities of the}} various agencies. He had to fend off attempts by the U.S. Army Air Forces to gain control of his aviation engineer battalions. The Royal Australian Air Force organized its own airbase construction squadrons and only with difficulty was Casey <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> their activities.|$|E
5|$|On 29 September 1940, a mid-air {{collision}} occurred over Brocklesby, New South Wales, Australia. The accident was unusual {{in that the}} aircraft involved, two Avro Ansons of No.2 Service Flying Training School RAAF, remained locked together after colliding, and then landed safely. The collision stopped the engines of the upper Anson, but those of the machine underneath continued to run, allowing the pair of aircraft to keep flying. Both navigators and the pilot of the lower Anson bailed out. The pilot of the upper Anson {{found that he was}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the interlocked aircraft with his ailerons and flaps, and made an emergency landing in a nearby paddock. All four crewmen survived the incident, and the upper Anson was repaired and returned to flight service.|$|E
