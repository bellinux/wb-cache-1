5|$|<b>Arsenic</b> is a grey, {{metallic}} looking solid. It has a {{density of}} 5.727 g/cm3 and is brittle, and moderately hard (more than aluminium; less than iron). It is stable in dry air but develops a golden bronze patina in moist air, which blackens on further exposure. <b>Arsenic</b> is attacked by nitric acid and concentrated sulfuric acid. It reacts with fused caustic soda {{to give the}} arsenate Na3AsO3 and hydrogen gas. <b>Arsenic</b> sublimes at 615°C. The vapour is lemon-yellow and smells like garlic. <b>Arsenic</b> only melts under a pressure of 38.6 atm, at 817°C. It is a semimetal with an electrical conductivity of around 3.9 × 104S•cm−1 and a band overlap of 0.5eV. Liquid <b>arsenic</b> is a semiconductor with a band gap of 0.15eV.|$|E
5|$|For relapsed acute {{promyelocytic leukemia}} (APL), <b>arsenic</b> {{trioxide}} is {{approved by the}} US FDA. Like ATRA, <b>arsenic</b> trioxide does not work with other subtypes of AML.|$|E
5|$|Orders for {{the bodies}} of the previously-deceased members of the {{household}} to be exhumed were issued {{when it became clear that}} <b>arsenic</b> was the mechanism of Thomas Higgins's death. The bodies of John Flannagan, Mary Higgins, and Margaret Jennings all showed evidence of minimal deterioration – a quality associated with <b>arsenic</b> poisoning – and traces of <b>arsenic</b> were found in the remains of all three.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of <b>arsenic</b> is predominately nonmetallic. Whether or not <b>arsenic</b> forms a cation is unclear. Its many metal alloys are mostly brittle. It shows fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by {{the formation of}} oxyanions. <b>Arsenic</b> generally forms compounds {{in which it has}} an oxidation state of +3 or +5. The halides, and the oxides and their derivatives are illustrative examples. In the trivalent state, <b>arsenic</b> shows some incipient metallic properties. The halides are hydrolysed by water but these reactions, particularly those of the chloride, are reversible {{with the addition of a}} hydrohalic acid. The oxide is acidic but, as noted below, (weakly) amphoteric. The higher, less stable, pentavalent state has strongly acidic (nonmetallic) properties. Compared to phosphorus, the stronger metallic character of <b>arsenic</b> is indicated by the formation of oxoacid salts such as AsPO4, As2(SO4)3 and <b>arsenic</b> acetate As(CH3COO)3. The oxide As2O3 is polymeric, amphoteric, and a glass former. <b>Arsenic</b> has an extensive organometallic chemistry (see organoarsenic chemistry).|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies can {{bioaccumulate}} {{the toxic}} heavy metal <b>arsenic</b> {{from the soil}} {{in the form of}} the compound methylarsonic acid. Although less toxic than <b>arsenic</b> trioxide, it is still relatively dangerous. Concentrations over 1000mg/kg (dry weight) are often reached. As reported in one 2004 publication, a mature specimen collected near the town of Český Šternberk in the Czech Republic was found to have an <b>arsenic</b> content of 7090mg/kg dry weight, the highest concentration ever reported in a mushroom. Typically, the <b>arsenic</b> content of mycorrhizal mushrooms collected from unpolluted areas is lower than 1mg/kg. In a 2007 Turkish study of 23 wild edible mushroom species (collected from areas not known to be polluted), S.coronaria had the highest concentration of <b>arsenic</b> at 8.8mg/kg dry weight, while the <b>arsenic</b> concentration of the other tested mushrooms ranged from 0.003mg/kg (in Sarcodon leucopus) to 0.54mg/kg (in Lactarius salmonicolor).|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} modern {{studies that have}} {{supported}} the original autopsy finding. In a 2008 study, researchers analysed samples of Napoleon's hair from throughout his life, as well as samples from his family and other contemporaries. All samples had high levels of <b>arsenic,</b> approximately 100 {{times higher than the}} current average. According to these researchers, Napoleon's body was already heavily contaminated with <b>arsenic</b> as a boy, and the high <b>arsenic</b> concentration in his hair was not caused by intentional poisoning; people were constantly exposed to <b>arsenic</b> from glues and dyes throughout their lives. Studies published in 2007 and 2008 dismissed evidence of <b>arsenic</b> poisoning, and confirmed evidence of peptic ulcer and gastric cancer as the cause of death.|$|E
5|$|After {{the deaths}} of the Gienkes, {{authorities}} began to investigate the cluster of deaths. The county sheriff, Fred Roshon, soon discovered that Martha Wise had signed at a local drug store for a series of purchases of large quantities of <b>arsenic.</b> An autopsy on Lily Gienke confirmed the presence of <b>arsenic</b> in her digestive tract. Brought in for questioning by the sheriff, Wise at first claimed she had obtained the <b>arsenic</b> to kill rats, but eventually confessed that she had used it to poison family members by putting it in water buckets and coffee pots the family drank out of.|$|E
5|$|Banshbaria Union {{has been}} {{declared}} as 100% sanitized, as all households in the union adopted sanitary latrines, while the upazila has only 16% sanitation coverage. A survey published in 2006 by the Bangladesh <b>Arsenic</b> Mitigation Water Supply Project found that of the 18,843 tube wells surveyed, 24.7% {{were found to be}} contaminated. Visible signs of <b>arsenic</b> poisoning were found in 47 people.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, {{the diaries}} of Napoleon's valet, Louis Marchand, were published. His {{description}} of Napoleon {{in the months}} before his death led Sten Forshufvud in a 1961 paper in Nature to put forward other causes for his death, including deliberate <b>arsenic</b> poisoning. <b>Arsenic</b> was used as a poison during the era because it was undetectable when administered over a long period. Forshufvud, in a 1978 book with Ben Weider, noted that Napoleon's body was found to be well preserved when moved in 1840. <b>Arsenic</b> is a strong preservative, and therefore this supported the poisoning hypothesis. Forshufvud and Weider observed that Napoleon had attempted to quench abnormal thirst by drinking large amounts of orgeat syrup that contained cyanide compounds in the almonds used for flavouring.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{initially}} {{assumed that}} the <b>arsenic</b> used to poison the victims had come from rat poison, but when common adulterants used in rat poison {{failed to show up}} in autopsies, they were forced {{to come up with a}} new theory. It was unlikely that the illiterate sisters would have been able to acquire <b>arsenic</b> through the usual method of visiting a chemist, a route more open to doctors than spinsters. Eventually it was discovered that common flypaper at the time contained <b>arsenic,</b> and that by soaking the flypaper in water, a solution substantially identical – including the same adulterants – to that found in a bottle at the Higgins residence could be obtained.|$|E
5|$|On Earth, nickel occurs {{most often}} in {{combination}} with sulfur and iron in pentlandite, with sulfur in millerite, with <b>arsenic</b> in the mineral nickeline, and with <b>arsenic</b> and sulfur in nickel galena. Nickel is commonly found in iron meteorites as the alloys kamacite and taenite.|$|E
5|$|Selenium is {{commonly}} {{described as a}} metalloid in the environmental chemistry literature. It moves through the aquatic environment similarly to <b>arsenic</b> and antimony; its water-soluble salts, in higher concentrations, have a similar toxicological profile to that of <b>arsenic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Selenium, and {{possibly}} boron, silicon, <b>arsenic</b> and tellurium, plus the organogen elements are sometimes categorized together as other nonmetals, as they fall outside the halogens and noble gases. The first {{five of these}} (Se; B, Si, As, Te) differ from the organogens: none are universally required for life; <b>arsenic</b> is notoriously poisonous; and tellurium hydride is a fairly strong, rather than weak, acidic hydride.|$|E
5|$|A 2015 study {{reported}} that during the non-monsoon season the levels of <b>arsenic</b> in the Duilong River, at 205.6 μg/L were higher than the WHO guideline of 10 μg/L for drinking water.|$|E
5|$|After the impact, villagers who had {{approached}} the impact site grew sick from a then-unexplained illness, {{with a wide}} array of symptoms. Two days later, Peruvian scientists confirmed that there had indeed been a meteorite strike, quieting widespread speculation that {{it may have been a}} geophysical rather than a celestial event. At that point, no further information on the cause of the mystery illness was known. The ground water in the local area is known to contain <b>arsenic</b> compounds, and the illness is now believed to have been caused by <b>arsenic</b> poisoning incurred when residents of the area inhaled the vapor of the boiling arsenic-contaminated water.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth forms {{trivalent}} and pentavalent compounds, the trivalent ones {{being more}} common. Many of its chemical properties {{are similar to}} those of <b>arsenic</b> and antimony, although they are less toxic than derivatives of those lighter elements.|$|E
5|$|Carl von Sickingen {{researched}} platinum {{extensively in}} 1772. He {{succeeded in making}} malleable platinum by alloying it with gold, dissolving the alloy in hot aqua regia, precipitating the platinum with ammonium chloride, igniting the ammonium chloroplatinate, and hammering the resulting finely divided platinum to make it cohere. Franz Karl Achard made the first platinum crucible in 1784. He worked with the platinum by fusing it with <b>arsenic,</b> then later volatilizing the <b>arsenic.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} exobiologists have {{proposed}} {{the existence of}} a shadow biosphere, a postulated microbial biosphere of Earth that uses radically different biochemical and molecular processes than currently known life. One of the proposals was the existence of lifeforms that use <b>arsenic</b> instead of phosphorus in DNA. A report in 2010 of the possibility in the bacterium GFAJ-1, was announced, though the research was disputed, and evidence suggests the bacterium actively prevents the incorporation of <b>arsenic</b> into the DNA backbone and other biomolecules.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to concerns about nuclear waste, numerous other pollutants {{are found in}} the river. These include chemical pesticides, bacteria, <b>arsenic,</b> dioxins, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB).|$|E
5|$|In {{the past}} the Norman water supply has also been criticized for the {{presence}} of excessive levels of <b>arsenic.</b> The city is attempting to combat this problem by building new wells and removing older ones.|$|E
5|$|Items {{added to}} the suicide cult punch mix by Jennifer include cyanide, <b>arsenic,</b> rat poison, and the book Couplehood by Paul Reiser.|$|E
5|$|Regarding Hall's fate, the {{official}} investigation that followed ruled {{the cause of}} death was apoplexy (an early term for stroke). Some of Hall's symptoms— partial paralysis, slurred speech, delirium— certainly fit that diagnosis. Indeed, the pains that Hall complained about down one side of his body, which he attributed to many years' huddling in an igloo, may have been due to a previous minor stroke. However, in 1968, Hall's biographer Chauncey C. Loomis, a professor at Dartmouth College, made an expedition to Greenland to exhume Hall's body. Because of the permafrost, Hall's body, flag shroud, clothing and coffin were remarkably well-preserved. Tests on tissue samples of bone, fingernails and hair showed that Hall had received large doses of <b>arsenic</b> in the last two weeks of his life. <b>Arsenic</b> poisoning appears consistent with the symptoms party members reported: stomach pains, vomiting, stupor, and mania. <b>Arsenic</b> can have a sweet taste, and Hall had complained that the coffee had tasted too sweet, and had burned his stomach. It also appears that at least three of the crew, Budington, Meyer, and Bessels, expressed relief at Hall's death and said that the expedition would be better off without him. In his book The Arctic Grail, Pierre Berton suggests that it is possible that Hall accidentally dosed himself with the poison, as <b>arsenic</b> was common in medical kits of the time. But it is considered more probable that he was murdered by one of the other members of the expedition, possibly Bessels, who was in nearly constant attendance of Hall. No charges were ever filed.|$|E
5|$|The {{biocidal}} {{effects of}} some heavy metals {{have been known}} since antiquity. Platinum, osmium, copper, ruthenium, and other heavy metals, including <b>arsenic,</b> are used in anti-cancer treatments, or have shown potential. Antimony (anti-protozoal), bismuth (anti-ulcer), gold (anti-arthritic), and iron (anti-malarial) are also important in medicine. Copper, zinc, silver, gold, or mercury are used in antiseptic formulations; small amounts of some heavy metals are used to control algal growth in, for example, cooling towers. Depending on their intended use as fertilisers or biocides, agrochemicals may contain heavy metals such as chromium, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, <b>arsenic,</b> cadmium, mercury, or lead.|$|E
5|$|The {{incidence}} of albinism can be artificially increased in fish by exposing the eggs to heavy metals (e.g. <b>arsenic,</b> cadmium, copper, mercury, selenium, zinc).|$|E
5|$|This {{reaction}} is {{conducted in the}} oxidising solvent <b>arsenic</b> pentafluoride. The trichloride anion, , has also been characterised; it is analogous to triiodide.|$|E
5|$|Vanadinite {{is in the}} apatite {{group of}} phosphates, and forms a {{chemical}} series with the minerals pyromorphite (Pb5(PO4)3Cl) and mimetite (Pb5(AsO4)3Cl), with both of which it may form solid solutions. Whereas most chemical series involve the substitution of metallic ions, this series substitutes its anion groups; phosphate (PO4), arsenate (AsO4) and vanadate (VO4). Common impurities of vanadinite include phosphorus, <b>arsenic</b> and calcium, where these may act as an isomorphic substitute for vanadium. Vanadinite when containing a high amount of the <b>arsenic</b> impurity is known as endlichite.|$|E
5|$|A colour {{reaction}} for salts of acetic acid is iron(III) chloride solution, {{which results in}} a deeply red colour that disappears after acidification. A more sensitive test uses lanthanum nitrate with iodine and ammonia to give a blue solution. Acetates when heated with <b>arsenic</b> trioxide form cacodyl oxide, which can be detected by its malodorous vapours.|$|E
5|$|After this, the alchemist Agathodaemon (around 300) {{spoke of}} a mineral that when mixed with natron {{produced}} a 'fiery poison'. He described this poison as 'disappearing in water', giving a clear solution. Emsley speculates that the 'fiery poison' was <b>arsenic</b> trioxide, the unidentified mineral having to have been either realgar or orpiment, due to {{the relation between the}} unidentified mineral and his other writings.|$|E
5|$|<b>Arsenic</b> and {{antimony}} are not semiconductors {{in their}} standard states. Both form type III-V semiconductors (such as GaAs, AlSb or GaInAsSb) {{in which the}} average number of valence electrons per atom is {{the same as that of}} Group 14 elements. These compounds are preferred for some special applications. Antimony nanocrystals may enable lithium-ion batteries to be replaced by more powerful sodium ion batteries.|$|E
5|$|Boron, silicon, germanium, <b>arsenic,</b> antimony, and {{tellurium}} are recognised commonly as metalloids. Depending on the author, one or {{more from}} selenium, polonium, or astatine are sometimes added to the list. Boron sometimes is excluded, by itself, or with silicon. Sometimes tellurium is not regarded as a metalloid. The inclusion of antimony, polonium, and astatine as metalloids also has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|Chromium, <b>arsenic,</b> cadmium, mercury, {{and lead}} have the {{greatest}} potential to cause harm on account of their extensive use, the toxicity {{of some of their}} combined or elemental forms, and their widespread distribution in the environment. Hexavalent chromium, for example, is highly toxic as are mercury vapour and many mercury compounds. These five elements have a strong affinity for sulfur; in the human body they usually bind, via thiol groups (–SH), to enzymes responsible for controlling the speed of metabolic reactions. The resulting sulfur-metal bonds inhibit the proper functioning of the enzymes involved; human health deteriorates, sometimes fatally. Chromium (in its hexavalent form) and <b>arsenic</b> are carcinogens; cadmium causes a degenerative bone disease; and mercury and lead damage the central nervous system.|$|E
5|$|Compounds of boron, silicon, <b>arsenic</b> and {{antimony}} {{have been}} used as flame retardants. Boron, in the form of borax, {{has been used as a}} textile flame retardant since at least the 18th century. Silicon compounds such as silicones, silanes, silsesquioxane, silica and silicates, some of which were developed as alternatives to more toxic halogenated products, can considerably improve the flame retardancy of plastic materials.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{smelting}} was independently {{invented in}} different places. It was probably discovered in China before 2800 BC, in Central America around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD. Investment casting {{was invented in}} 4500–4000 BC in Southeast Asia and carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK, at 2280 to 1890 BC. Ötzi the Iceman, a male dated from 3300–3200 BC, was found with an axe with a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels of <b>arsenic</b> in his hair suggest an involvement in copper smelting. Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, copper smelting led {{to the discovery of}} iron smelting. Production in the Old Copper Complex in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC. Natural bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon, <b>arsenic,</b> and (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC.|$|E
5|$|However, further {{investigations}} {{have led to}} the conclusion that the <b>arsenic</b> content in the groundwater did not differ from that of the local drinking supply, and that the illness reported was likely caused by the vaporization of troilite, a sulfur-bearing compound present within the meteorite in large amounts, which would have melted at relatively low temperatures and high pressures created by such an impact.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to dissolved gases, hot water from geothermal sources may hold in solution trace amounts of toxic {{elements such as}} mercury, <b>arsenic,</b> boron, and antimony. These chemicals precipitate as the water cools, and can cause environmental damage if released. The modern practice of injecting cooled geothermal fluids back into the Earth to stimulate production has the side benefit of reducing this environmental risk.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} of antimony is characteristic of a nonmetal. Antimony has some definite cationic chemistry, SbO+ and Sb(OH)2+ being present in acidic aqueous solution; the compound Sb8(GaCl4)2, which contains the homopolycation, Sb82+, was prepared in 2004. It can form alloys {{with one or more}} metals such as aluminium, iron, nickel, copper, zinc, tin, lead and bismuth. Antimony has fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by the formation of oxyanions. Like <b>arsenic,</b> antimony generally forms compounds in which it has an oxidation state of +3 or +5. The halides, and the oxides and their derivatives are illustrative examples. The +5 state is less stable than the +3, but relatively easier to attain than with <b>arsenic.</b> This is explained by the poor shielding afforded the <b>arsenic</b> nucleus by its 3d10 electrons. In comparison, the tendency of antimony (being a heavier atom) to oxidize more easily partially offsets the effect of its 4d10 shell. Tripositive antimony is amphoteric; pentapositive antimony is (predominately) acidic. Consistent with an increase in metallic character down group 15, antimony forms salts or salt-like compounds including a nitrate Sb(NO3)3, phosphate SbPO4, sulfate Sb2(SO4)3 and perchlorate Sb(ClO4)3. The otherwise acidic pentoxide Sb2O5 shows some basic (metallic) behaviour in that it can be dissolved in very acidic solutions, with the formation of the oxycation SbO. The oxide Sb2O3 is polymeric, amphoteric, and a glass former. Antimony has an extensive organometallic chemistry (see organoantimony chemistry).|$|E
