5|$|Although {{hostilities}} {{existed between}} the Mam and the K'iche' of Q'umarkaj after the rebellion of the Kaqchikel people against their K'iche' allies, the <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish conquistadors shifted the political landscape.

5|$|Egypt {{and much}} of Palestine were {{controlled}} by the Arab Shi'ite Fatimid Caliphate, which was significantly smaller since the <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Seljuqs. Warfare between the Fatimids and Seljuqs caused great disruption for the local Christians and for western pilgrims. The Fatimids, under the nominal rule of caliph al-Musta'li but actually controlled by vizier al-Afdal Shahanshah, had lost Jerusalem to the Seljuqs in 1073 (although some older accounts say 1076); they recaptured it in 1098 from the Artuqids, a smaller Turkish tribe associated with the Seljuqs, just before the <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crusaders.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, {{the celebration}} of 200 years since the <b>arrival</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> First Fleet was {{organised}} on a large scale, with many significant events taking place in all major cities.

30|$|We tested {{different}} {{configurations of}} this algorithm with steering directions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beams equal to <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> <b>arrivals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sources and with fixed steering directions. We also varied the step angle between the beams. The beamforming preprocessing improves the separation performance as {{it reduces the}} reverberation and noise effects. The maximum gain is obtained when we select the beams with the highest energies and use the corresponding filters as beamformers or when the sources DOAs are known. The beamforming preprocessing with fixed steering directions has also good performance and does not use an estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DOAs or beam selection, which represent a gain in the processing time. Using the 5 ° step beamforming preprocessing with beams selection, we can also have a rough estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> <b>arrivals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sources.|$|R
