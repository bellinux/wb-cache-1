5|$|Another area of {{interest}} for Rubin was the phenomenon of counter-rotation in galaxies. Her discovery that some gas and stars moved {{in the opposite direction}} to the rotation {{of the rest of the}} galaxy challenged the prevailing theory that all of the material in a galaxy moved in the same direction, <b>and</b> <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> first evidence for galaxy mergers and the process by which galaxies initially formed.|$|E

He also became a trustee of The New School in New York, to whom he donated $100,000 <b>and</b> <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> money for a scholarship.|$|E
5|$|The Narragansett was {{possibly}} an ambling horse, {{rather than a}} true pacing breed. It {{was known as a}} sure-footed, dependable breed, although not flashy or always good-looking. Pacers were used for racing and general riding. They were frequently crossed with other breeds, <b>and</b> <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> foundation for several other American breeds, including the American Saddlebred, Standardbred and Tennessee Walking Horse.|$|E

5|$|As supervisor, Newsom had as his {{centerpiece}} a voter initiative called Care Not Cash (Measure N), {{which offered}} care, supportive housing, drug treatment, and help from behavioral health specialists {{for the homeless}} in lieu of direct cash aid from the state's general assistance program. Many homeless rights advocates protested against the initiative. The successfully passed ballot measure raised the political profile of Gavin Newsom <b>and</b> <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> volunteers, donors, and campaign staff that helped make him a leading contender for the mayorship in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Bite force {{estimates}} for Deinonychus were first produced in 2005, based on reconstructed jaw musculature. This {{study concluded that}} Deinonychus likely had a maximum bite force only 15% that of the modern American alligator. A 2010 study by Paul Gignac and colleagues attempted to estimate the bite force based directly on newly discovered Deinonychus tooth puncture marks in the bones of a Tenontosaurus. These puncture marks came from a large individual, <b>and</b> <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> first evidence that large Deinonychus could bite through bone. Using the tooth marks, Gignac's team were able to determine that the bite force of Deinonychus {{was significantly higher than}} earlier studies had estimated by biomechanical studies alone. They found the bite force of Deinonychus to be between 4,100 and 8,200 newtons, greater than living carnivorous mammals including the hyena, and equivalent to a similarly sized alligator.|$|E

5|$|Both {{boats were}} {{commissioned}} into the Austro-Hungarian Navy in 1909, with U-4 commissioned in August and U-3 in September. During the evaluations {{conducted by the}} Navy, the U-3 design bested the U-1 (Lake) and U-5 (Holland) classes in reliability <b>and</b> <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> best living conditions. They did, however, have the worst diving abilities of the three designs, and produced excessive exhaust smoke. To remedy the diving problems of the U-3-class, the fins were changed in size and shape several times. Eventually the front diving planes were removed and a stationary stern flap was affixed to the hull.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{spent most}} of this time {{exploring}} on land: three years and three months on land, 18 months at sea. Early in the voyage {{he decided that he}} could write a book about geology, and he showed a gift for theorising. At Punta Alta he made a major find of gigantic fossils of extinct mammals, then known from only a very few specimens. He ably collected and made detailed observations of plants and animals, with results that shook his belief that species were fixed <b>and</b> <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> basis for ideas which came to him when back in England, and led to his theory of evolution by natural selection.|$|E
5|$|Fàbregas {{started in}} {{the centre of the}} front three of a 4–3–3 {{formation}} against Italy in Spain's opening Group C match, essentially acting as a false 9. In the 64th minute he scored the equaliser after Italy had taken the lead in the 61st minute; the game finished in a 1–1 draw. He then scored his second goal of the tournament in the next group stage match against Ireland, which ended in a 4–0 win to Spain. When Spain faced Portugal in the semi-finals and the game remained scoreless at the end of extra time, Fàbregas scored the winning penalty of the shootout as Spain prevailed 4–2. In the final against Italy, Fàbregas started <b>and</b> <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> assist to David Silva for the game's opening goal, en route to a 4–0 Spain victory.|$|E

5|$|In the Pacific, US forces {{continued}} to press back the Japanese perimeter. In mid-June 1944, they began their offensive against the Mariana and Palau islands, and decisively defeated Japanese {{forces in the}} Battle of the Philippine Sea. These defeats led to {{the resignation of the}} Japanese Prime Minister, Hideki Tojo, <b>and</b> <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> United States with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the Japanese home islands. In late October, American forces invaded the Filipino island of Leyte; soon after, Allied naval forces scored another large victory in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, one of the largest naval battles in history.|$|E
5|$|KQED, after airing The Rejected, did not archive a {{hard copy}} of the {{documentary}}, and for many years, the full documentary was considered lost, with only transcripts available. Robert Chehoski, an archivist for KQED, and Alex Cherian, an archivist for the J. Paul Leonard Library at San Francisco State University, searched for any remaining hard copy {{for up to six}} years. Eventually, the two found that the film was owned by WNET, which funded the film, and a single 2-inch quad videotape was archived in the Library of Congress. The Library's Recording Laboratory had already remastered the film onto a digital format <b>and</b> <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> San Francisco Bay Area Television Archive with a copy, for the purpose of making it available online. The 60-minute film was released by the TV Archive online on May 22, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Levant {{returned}} to Portsmouth in early 1775, but put to sea again on 22 June amid {{the early stages}} of the American Revolutionary War. Captain Murray's orders were to join a Mediterranean squadron under the overall command of Captain Robert Mann, which was tasked with intercepting merchant vessels suspected of supplying American rebels. While at sea Murray also took the opportunity to train his crew in seamanship and battle techniques, in preparation for future enemy engagement. In March 1776 she anchored in the Bay of Algiers where the Dey, or local ruler, received her warmly <b>and</b> <b>provided</b> <b>the</b> crew with supplies of bread, vegetables, and three live sheep.|$|E
