40|$|The {{genetic control}} of eight isozyme loci {{revealed}} by starch gel electrophoresis was studied through {{the analysis of}} three progenies derived from four tetraploid cultivars of Solanum tuberosum (groups Andigena and Tuberosum). Duplicate gene expression was found in seven (Got-A, Got-B, Pgd-C, Pgi-B, Pgm-A, Pgm-B and Pox-C) isozyme loci. In another isozyme gene (Adh-A), the parental genotypes were not adequate to distinguish between a monogenic or a digenic model of genetic control. Tetrasomic inheritance was demonstrated in four (Got-A, Got-B, Pgd-C and Pgi-B) isozyme loci. In the remaining duplicate genes, the parental genotypes precluded discrimination between disomic or tetrasomic models. Tetrasomic segregations of the chromosomal type were generally found; however, the isozyme phenotypes shown by three descendants from selfing cv. Katahdin indicate the occurrence of chromatid segregations, although aneuploidy cannot be ruled out.

40|$|Corn {{and rice}} genetic linkage map {{alignments}} were extended and refined {{by the addition}} of 262 new, reciprocally mapped maize cDNA loci. Twenty chromosomal rearrangements were identified in maize relative to rice and these included telomeric fusions between rice linkage groups, nested insertion of rice linkage groups, intrachromosomal inversions, and a nonreciprocal translocation. Maize genome evolution was inferred relative to other species within the Panicoideae and a progenitor maize genome with eight linkage groups was proposed. Conservation of composite linkage groups indicates that the tetrasomic state arose during maize evolution either from duplication of one progenitor corn genome (<b>autoploidy)</b> or from a cross between species that shared the composite linkages observed in modern maize (alloploidy). New evidence of a quadruplicated homeologous segment on maize chromosomes 2 and 10, and 3 and 4, corresponded to the internally duplicated region on rice chromosomes 11 and 12 and suggested that this duplication in the rice genome predated the divergence of the Panicoideae and Oryzoideae subfamilies. Charting of the macroevolutionary steps leading to the modern maize genome clarifies the interpretation of intercladal comparative maps and facilitates alignments and genomic cross-referencing of genes and phenotypes among grass family members...|$|E

40|$|Ipomoea fnfida (H. B. K.) DON. forms a {{polyploid}} complex with a {{range from}} diploid to hexaploid. The synthesized hexaploids (SH, 2 n= 6 x= 90) with I. trlfida d{ploid (K 221, 2 n = 2 x= 30) and tetraplold (K 233, 2 n= 4 x= 60) have been considered {{to have the same}} genomic structure (B 1 B 1 B 2 B 2 B 2 B 2) as the sweet potato (SP, 2 n= 6 x= 90). To determine the genomic structure of the derived hexaploids (DH) frorn intercrosses of I. trzfida triploid (K 222, 2 n= 3 x= 45), and the genomic structure of I. trzfida hexaploid (K 123, 2 n= 6 x= 90), F_ 1 hybrids from DH×SH, DH×SP, SH×K 123, and DH×K 123, and their backcross (BC_ 1) and double-cross progenies have been cytologically examined. When the genomes existing in quadruplicate in the parental hexaploids are non-homologous, such non-homology may cause failure of chromosome pairing in a BC_ 1 or double-cross progeny. Meiotic analyses of these hexaploid hybrids showed almost complete chromosome pairing at the matephase I (MI), suggesting that the hexaploids DH and K 123 have the same genomic structure just as do SH and the sweet potato. Further, to clarify the genomic structure of the sweet potato and the I. tnfida hexaploids by estimating the degree of homology between the B_ 1 and B_ 2 genomes, meiotic pairing was observed in the tetraploid hybrids (B_ 1 B_ 1 B_ 2 B_ 2) from DH×K 221 and tetraploid hybrids (B_ 1 B_ 2 B_ 2 B_ 2) from (DH×K 221) ×K 233. Both tetraploid hybrlds demonstrated a reasonable frequency of tetravalents to support the <b>autoploidy</b> of their genomic constitution. These results led {{to the conclusion that the}} sweet potato and the I trifida hexaploids are autoploids with respect to the B genome of the I. trlfida diploid (K 221). The use of wild germplasm of I. trtfida to incorporate its valuable traits into cultivars was undertaken and 'has brought some remarkable results in sweet potato breeding. A significant role of the <b>autoploidy</b> in possible gene flow through inter- and intraploidy hybridization between the sweet potato and I. trlfida was discussed. サツマイモに最も近縁な種Ipomoea trifidaは二倍体から六倍体をふくむ倍数体複合種である.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The Artemisia ludoviciana {{polyploid}} {{complex is}} a highly polymorphic assembledge of eight taxa in the Pacific Northwest, with a chromosome base number of x= 9. A cytogenetic analysis of this complex was carried out to determine the sources of its variation, the types of polyploidy present, and the genetic processes active in its evolution. Chromosome counts in the complex disclosed two diploid taxa, A. michauxiana and A. cavaticaulis, {{in addition to the}} previously counted diploids, A. suksdorfii and A. lindleyana. Results of meiotic analysis and artificial hybridization experiments strongly suggested the autoploid origin of the polyploid members of the complex. These results included the constancy of multivalent formation among the polyploids, the maximum number of multivalents formed in each taxon, the pairing relationships of the hexaploid and trisomic hexaploid A. douglasiana, the degree of homology between the included genomes of the artificial hybrids, and the presence of heteroploidy in at least five of the included taxa. The attributes of the complex that might have contributed to the origin and success of <b>autoploidy</b> were also examined. Observations indicate that the diploids produce a low but constant number of unreduced pollen grains. Introgression from the diploid to the tetraploid level, through tetraploid progeny, provides a source of variation for the newly formed autoploids. The complex has a broad physiological base. Mechanisms are present in the meiotic apparatus that could allow for an increase in fertility of autoploid individuals. The phylogenetic and taxonomic relationships among several of the taxa are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Studies based upon; 9012 Interspecific sexual crosses (attempted in 42, 96 and 18 amphidiploid-amphidiploid, amphidiploid-diploid and diploid-diploid {{combinations}} respectively), and chromosomal {{associations in}} 5 species, 8 digenomic triploids, 3 trigenomic haploids and 2 induced colchiploids are presented here. Crosses were attempted among fourteen genotypes, three each of B. nigra, B. campestris, B. juncea, B. napus {{and two of}} B. carinata. Sum of 2645, 4823 and 1544 pollinations were made at the amphidiploid-amphidiploid, amphidiploid-diploid and diploid-diploid levels, respectively. The crossibility was very high at amphidiploid- amphidiploid ploidy level. Brassica napus and B. juncea among the species and B. juncea X B. napus among the combinations/direction of cross proved highly crossible. Brassica juncea crossed freely with Brassica napus and B. campestris, and fairly with B. carinata and B. nigra. Brassica napus neither proved as a good seed parent or as a good pollinator with B. carinata. None out of 267 pollinations attempted In 6 combinations of B. campestris x B. carinata produced any hybrid seed. Hence Brassica juncea among the species and Jun 9 among its genotypes proved the highly crossible {{and can be used}} as bridge for genetic transgression across the genomes. The cross-compatibility at every level demonstrated the monophyletic origin of Brassica species. The highly crossible amphidiploids however determine their relative phylogenetic closeness as compared to the diploids. Chromosomally B. campestris (2 N) proved as ideal diploids with 1 / 1 synapsis and 1 - 1 disjunction. Neither any secondary association nor any B chromosomes was observed in its PMC's, at Ml. <b>Autoploidy</b> was induced through applying 0. 02 70 aqueous colchicine to the seedlings of Brassica campestris and it was concluded that, its 6 hours treatment is threshold for colchiploidy induction in Brassica. In autotetraploids however, the chromosomes were oriented into asyndetics, one or two-chiasmatic bivalents, trivalents and quadrivalents. The anomalous chromosomal behavior predicts the imbalance chromosomal disjunction; resulting into viable aberrant gametes the union of such gametes could give rise to individuals, with a variety of genome constitutions. Meiotic analysis of autotetraploids that, <b>autoploidy</b> and the union of their aberrant gametes has probably {{played an important role in}} the evolution of the present Brassica species. Meiotic analysis in 8 digenomic triploids, 4 each containing genomes AAC and AAB, and 3 trigenomic haploids containing genomes ABC revealed univalent, bivalent and multivalent chromosomal configurations of various orientations. Variation in pollen fertility was so evident even within a plant and tetrads ranging from all the fertile to all the sterile gametocytes with variety of all the possible intermediates were available. Though variation among chromosomal association was present at the combinations and association levels uniformity in the frequency of the synaptic and asynaptic chromosomes was uniforl 1 l i. e. 70 and 30 percent respectively either in the case of digenomic triploids or trigenomic haploids. Ml associations both in digenomic triploids or trigenomic haploids showed that, no one among the genomes B or C had got any genetic factor for suppressing the homoeologous pairing among genomes A, from various sources. Besides autosyndesis among the genomes A, allosyndesis was also evident among the genomes A, C and B from the same or different sources, respectively. Furthermore meiotic regularity was higher in the digenomic triploids ABA and ACA as compared to the trigenomic haploids ABC. The studies also concluded that, whatsoever the source or origin of genome A was, it has retained chromosomal homology resulting frequently into the autosyndetic bivalents in the digenomic triploids...|$|E
40|$|Gene {{frequencies}} at 13 isozyme loci {{were determined}} in three South American taxa of cultivated potatoes [the diploid group (gp.) Stenotomum, the diploid subgroups (subgp.) Goniocalyx, and the tetraploid gp. Andigena ofS. tuberosum], in the diploid weed speciesS. sparsipilum, {{and in most}} of the main cultivars now raised in the Northern Hemisphere (the tetraploid gp. Tuberosum ofS. tuberosum). High levels of genetic variability (mean number of alleles per locus, percentage of polymorphic loci, and mean heterozygosity) were detected, being higher in tetraploid potatoes. An equilibrium among the evolutionary factors which increase genetic variability and artificial selection for maximum yield would explain the high uniformity of heterozygosity values we observed in both Andigena (0. 36 ± 0. 02) and Tuberosum (0. 38 ± 0. 01) cultivars. —The low value of genetic distance (D = 0. 044) between Stenotomum and Goniocalyx does not support the status of species forS. goniocalyx. —In most isozyme loci, the electromorphs of gp. Andigena were a combination of those found in both gp. Stenotomum andS. sparsipilum, suggesting an amphidiploid origin of gp. Andigena from that two diploid taxa. The presence in Andigena of unique electromorphs, which were lacking in both gp. Stenotomum andS. sparsipilum, suggests that other diploid species could be also implied in the origin of tetraploid Andean potatoes. Furthermore, since Andigena were more related to Stenotomum (D = 0. 052) than toS. sparsipilum (D = 0. 241), the autopolyploidization of Stenotomum individuals and the subsequent hybridization with gp. Andigena may also have occurred. Thus, our study suggests a multiple origin (amphidiploidy, <b>autoploidy,</b> and hybridization at tetraploid level) of gp. Andigena. —Most of the electromorphs of gp. Tuberosum were also found in gp. Andigena; both the direct derivation of that group from the Andean tetraploid potatoes and the repeated introgression provided by breeding programmes could explain this result. However, the allele c of Pgm-B, present in 30 out of 76 Tuberosum cultivars from Northern Hemisphere as well as in 3 Chilean Tuberosum cultivars, lacks in the 258 Andigena genotypes sampled, suggesting that Chilean germplasm could have taken part in the origin of at least the 39 % of the potato cultivars from Europe and North America analyzed here. —The distanceWagner procedure provides an estimate of a 30 % of heterogeneity in the evolutionary divergence shown by different groups of cultivated potatoes. Diploid groups show a higher (22. 5 %) evolutionary rate than tetraploids, which can be attributed to both tetrasomic inheritance and facultative autofecundation that exists in Andigena and Tuberosum groups. Thus, artificial selection acting since 10000 years has not resulted in a higher rate of molecular evolution at the isozyme level in the tetraploids. Caja de Madrid (España) Peer reviewe...|$|E
