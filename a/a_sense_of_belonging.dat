5|$|Alexander's legacy {{extended}} beyond his military conquests. His campaigns greatly increased contacts and trade between East and West, and vast areas {{to the east}} were significantly exposed to Greek civilization and influence. Some of the cities he founded became major cultural centers, many surviving into the 21st century. His chroniclers recorded valuable information about the areas through which he marched, while the Greeks themselves got <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> to a world beyond the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|In {{the present}} day, Karman has {{returned}} to Pegaten to a warm reception. Marni, although she admits that she still loves Karman, insists that she will stay with her new husband; Haji Bakir, Karman's uncle, and Karman's mother have likewise forgiven him. Tini and Haji Bakir's grandson Jabir are betrothed as planned, and, when the villagers renovate the dilapidated mosque, Karman makes the cupola. He receives much praise for his work and finds <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> in the mosque.|$|E
5|$|Falle had no role models. She {{began writing}} poetry about suicide and wearing black clothing. She acted out by {{stealing}} cars and using drugs recreationally. She {{started out with}} soft drugs and {{then moved on to}} using psychedelic mushrooms and LSD. Her associates in these criminal activities, who came from similarly dysfunctional backgrounds, provided her with <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> that she no longer found at home. Falle's mother had a series of boyfriends who abused her and made the house unsafe, so Falle ran away from home. She slept at friends' houses, on their couches and in tents in their backyards, concealing her presence from her friends' parents.|$|E

5|$|Major {{cities and}} {{regional}} rivalry {{played an important}} role in the wars. The disappearance of a central, imperial authority—and in some cases of even a local, viceregal authority (as in the cases of New Granada and Río de la Plata)—initiated a prolonged period of balkanization in many regions of Spanish America. It was not clear which political units which should replace the empire, and there were no new national identities to replace the traditional sense of being Spaniards. The original juntas of 1810 appealed first, to a sense of being Spanish, which was counterposed to the French threat; second, to a general American identity, which was counterposed to the Peninsula lost to the French; and third, to <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> to the major cities or local province, the patria in Spanish. More often than not, juntas sought to maintain a province's independence from the capital of the former viceroyalty or captaincy general as much as from the Peninsula itself. Armed conflicts broke out between the provinces over the question of whether some cities or provinces were to be subordinate to others as they had been under the crown. This phenomenon was particularly evident in South America. This rivalry also leads some regions to adopt the opposite political cause to that chosen by their rivals. Peru seems to have remained strongly royalist in large part because of its rivalry with Río de la Plata, to which it had lost control of Upper Peru when the latter was elevated to a viceroyalty in 1776. The creation of juntas in Río de la Plata allowed Peru to regain formal control of Upper Peru for the duration of the wars.|$|E
25|$|Also, in some Indigenous {{communities}} in the Americas, motivation is a driving force for learning. Children are incorporated and welcomed to participate in daily activities and thus feel motivated to participate due to them seeking <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> in their families and communities.|$|E
25|$|Meaning-making through {{spirituality and}} religiosity is {{significant}} because it helps individuals cope with their loss, as well as develop their own spiritual or religious beliefs. Spirituality and religiosity helps grievers think about a transcendental reality, share their worldview, and feel <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> to communities with shared beliefs.|$|E

25|$|Difficulties with {{adjusting}} to adult life: {{the mixture of}} influences from the various cultures that the individual has lived can create challenges in developing an identity {{as well as with}} <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging.</b> Feelings of rootlessness and restlessness can make the transition to adulthood a challenging period for TCKs.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that this is the primary therapeutic factor from which all others flow. Humans are herd animals with an instinctive need to belong to groups, and personal development can only take place in an interpersonal context.

25|$|In {{the fourteenth}} century, the Flemish vehemently denied their French {{citizenship}} and {{identified themselves as}} Fleming.

The report showed that 90% of Pakistanis feel <b>a</b> strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> in Britain compared to 84% of white Britons. English Pakistanis tend to identify much more with the United Kingdom than with England, with 63% describing themselves in a Policy Exchange survey as exclusively [...] "British" [...] and not [...] "English" [...] in terms of nationality, and only 15% saying they were solely English.|$|R
25|$|The first Absolutely Incredible Kid Day, a call {{to action}} for all adults to {{communicate}} through letters their love and commitment to children, took place in 1997. In 2003 to further its commitment and inclusiveness, Camp Fire USA began translating its curricula to Spanish. As a way to excite and educate children in Pre-K, the Little Stars program, first developed by Camp Fire Green Country, was introduced nationally in 2005.

25|$|At {{lower levels}} of Maslow's {{hierarchy}} of needs, such as physiological needs, money is a motivator, however it tends to have a motivating effect on staff that lasts only {{for a short period}} (in accordance with Herzberg's two-factor model of motivation). At higher levels of the hierarchy, praise, respect, recognition, empowerment and <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> are far more powerful motivators than money, as both Abraham Maslow's theory of motivation and Douglas McGregor's theory X and theory Y (pertaining to the theory of leadership) demonstrate.|$|E
25|$|Humans {{have always}} been tribal creatures. In ancient times, {{primitive}} man lived in a tribe that provided him with physical and nutritional security, and <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging.</b> He could not have survived otherwise. Nowadays, the state provides all these things. It provides external protection {{by means of the}} military, and internal protection by means of the police. It also provides a security umbrella in terms of food and clothing and shelter in times of need. Most important, it satisfies that deep human need to belong to a group. The modern state has replaced the ancient tribe.|$|E

40|$|Much {{existing}} research assumes {{that there is}} an opposition between mobility and territorial belonging, so that mobile persons tend to have <b>a</b> weak <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> whereas persons with <b>a</b> strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> are less willing than others to move. Some studies, however, suggest that mobility may coex-ist with or even reinforce territorial belonging. This article uses Swedish sur-vey data to introduce two important qualifications to this discussion. First, it shows that different kinds of mobility—daily commuting, long-distance travel, residential mobility, and international migration—are differently related to people’s <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging.</b> Second, by examining local, regional, national, and European belonging, it shows that the relationship between mobility and belonging is to some extent a matter of territorial scale...|$|R
25|$|The club's {{office and}} {{training}} facilities {{are located in}} the one location, Blacktown International Sportspark.

It was initially believed that the club's administration and training facilities would be based at Football New South Wales' headquarters at Valentine Park in Parklea but the facilities at the ground were not to the standard required. Parramatta Council as part of its bid to host the team in the city offered Council owned office space inside the Parramatta CBD but this was declined in favour of staying at Blacktown.|$|E
25|$|Homelessness is the {{condition}} of people without a permanent dwelling, such as a house or apartment. People who are homeless are most often unable to acquire and maintain regular, safe, secure and adequate housing. The legal definition of homeless varies from country to country, or among different jurisdictions in the same country or region. The term homeless may also include people whose primary night-time residence is in a homeless shelter, a domestic violence shelter, long-term residence in a motel, a vehicle, squatting, cardboard boxes, a tent city, tarpaulins, shanty town structures made of discarded building materials or other ad hoc housing situations. According to the UK homelessness charity Crisis, a home {{is not just a}} physical space: it also provides roots, identity, security, <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> and a place of emotional wellbeing. American government homeless enumeration studies also include people who sleep in a public or private place not designed for use as a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings. There are a number of organizations who provide help for the homeless.|$|E
25|$|Blanchett {{is married}} to playwright and screenwriter Andrew Upton. They met in 1996 {{on the set of}} a TV show and were married on 29 December 1997. Blanchett and Upton have four children: {{biological}} sons Dashiell John (b. December 2001), Roman Robert (b. April 2004), and Ignatius Martin (b. April 2008), and adopted daughter Edith Vivian Patricia, whose adoption was confirmed in March 2015. Blanchett said {{that she and her husband}} had been wanting to adopt ever since the birth of their first child. After making Brighton, England their main family home for nearly 10 years, she and her husband returned to their native Australia in 2006. In November 2006, Blanchett attributed this move to desires to select a permanent home for her children, to be closer to her family, and to have <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> to the Australian theatrical community. She and her family lived in the Sydney suburb of Hunters Hill. Their Hunters Hill residence underwent extensive renovations in 2007 to be made more eco-friendly. Following the sale of their property there in late 2015, Blanchett and Upton purchased a house in East Sussex, England in early 2016.|$|E

25|$|The Laurel {{apartment}} building on 82nd Street at Northern Boulevard {{was the first}} of the Queensboro Corporation buildings in Jackson Heights, completed in 1914 with a small courtyard. The Greystones on either side of 80th Street between 37th and 35th Avenues were completed in 1918 with a design by architect George H. Wells. There was leftover unused space, which was converted to parks, gardens, and recreational areas, including a golf course; much of this leftover space, including the golf course, no longer exists. This was followed by the 1919 construction of the Andrew J. Thomas-designed Linden Court, a 10-building complex between 84th Street, 85th Streets, 37th Avenue, and Roosevelt Avenue. The two sets of 5 buildings each, separated by a gated garden with linden trees and two pathways, included parking spaces with single-story garages accessed via narrow driveways, the first Jackson Heights development to do so; gaps at regular intervals in the perimeter wall; a layout that provided light and ventilation to the apartments, as well as fostered <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>belonging</b> to a community; the area's first co-op; and now-prevalent private gardens surrounded by the building blocks.|$|E
