40|$|A wave <b>absorption</b> <b>control</b> {{strategy}} is proposed to suppress vibration at the distal {{end of a}} flexible robotic arm while achieving accurate position control. It assumes the flexible arm with an actuator {{at one end and}} a load at the other, and interprets the arm’s dynamics with a lumped model in terms of mechanical waves entering and leaving the arm at the actuator-arm interface. Control input to the actuator is thus resolved into two superposed waves, which the actuator launches and absorbs simultaneously. From the motion start-up, the launch wave is assigned to the actuator, to which the absorbing wave is added subsequently. The absorbing wave is computed with the delayed tip motion. It absorbs the vibratory energy within the arm, and prevents the wave returning from the arm tip from entering the control system again. The properties of the control scheme proposed are studied throughout. It works very well under uncertainty, and is stable and robust, for tip positioning and trajectory tracking control, as demonstrated in the numerical results...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel technique to efficiently compute illumination for Direct Volume Rendering using a local approximation of ambient occlusion {{to integrate the}} intensity of incident light for each voxel. An advantage with this local approach is that fully shadowed regions are avoided, a desirable feature in many applications of volume rendering such as medical visualization. Additional transfer function interactions are also presented, for instance, to highlight specific structures with luminous tissue effects and create an improved context for semitransparent tissues with a separate <b>absorption</b> <b>control</b> for the illumination settings. Multiresolution volume management and GPU-based computation are used to accelerate the calculations and support large data sets. The scheme yields interactive frame rates with an adaptive sampling approach for incrementally refined illumination under arbitrary transfer function changes. The illumination effects can give {{a better understanding of}} the shape and density of tissues and so has the potential to increase the diagnostic value of medical volume rendering. Since the proposed method is gradient-free, it is especially beneficial at the borders of clip planes, where gradients are undefined, and for noisy data sets. © 2009 IEEE.

For a proper choice {{of media and}} graphene doping/gating one can approach 50 - 100 % absorption in the GHz-THz range for the one atom thick material. This <b>absorption</b> is <b>controlled</b> by a characteristic chemical potential which depends only on carrier life-time and the indexes of refraction of the dielectric embedding...|$|R

We demonstrate rapid switching between picosecond and femtosecond operational regimes in a Cr 4 +:forsterite laser, using an electrically-contacted GaInNAs SESAM with saturable <b>absorption</b> characteristics <b>controlled</b> via the quantum-confined Stark effect. Additionally, continuous picosecond pulse duration tuning by over a factor 3 is reported. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} by immunocytochemistry the distribution of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in human and murine gastric epithelium. Using two different antisera specific for neuronal NOS (nNOS), we detected nNOS immunoreactivity in endocrine cells of the epithelium of the body and pyloric regions as well as in ganglion cells of the intrinsic plexi of the stomach of the three species studied. Both immunocytochemistry of contiguous sections and double immunolabeling methods showed that the nNOS-immunoreactive cells were also immunoreactive for somatostatin. Co-localization of nNOS and somatostatin has also been found in the pancreatic islets, where strong nNOS immunoreactivity appeared in scattered cells, which were peripheral in rat and mouse islets and more randomly distributed in human. The possibility of crossreactivity between the antisera against nNOS and somatostatin was ruled out by means of <b>absorption</b> <b>controls.</b> Immunocytochemical techniques were also applied to thin sections, confirming the immunostaining of gastric D-cells, which was restricted principally to the secretory granules. The possible functional implications of these findings for gastric and pancreatic physiology are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The body's <b>control</b> {{over the}} <b>absorption</b> of iron from the {{gastrointestinal}} tract {{has remained a}} fascinating and somewhat elusive problem in spite of considerable study. The data collected over many years and by various investigators (12) indicate that under ordinary conditions the body carefully guards its supply of iron. The limited ability to excrete iron points to <b>absorption</b> <b>controlled</b> by some mechanism {{which seems to be}} located in the cells of the gastrointestinal mucosa. This mechanism is in some manner linked to the amount of iron in storage since acute anemia does not increase iron absorption whereas depletion of the iron stores effected by regeneration after acute bleeding, or associated with a chronic iron deficiency anemia, markedly increases it (6). In a small series of preliminary experiments (6) {{it was found that the}} absorption of an oral dose of radioiron was somewhat reduced when preceded at 1 to 6 hours by a feeding of 100 rag. of ordinary iron. It was concluded therefrom that under these conditions the mucosa could be saturated or "blocked " in a matter of hours...|$|R
40|$|The DA {{isotherm}} {{parameters for}} U, Pu, Sr and Np have been updated {{to include a}}dditional data obtained since the original derivation. The DA isotherms were modified to include a kinetic function derived by Rahn to describe sorbate loading {{from the beginning of}} sorption up to equilibrium. The final functions describe both kinetic and thermodynamic sorption. We selected the Rahn function to describe radionuclide sorption because it originates from diffusion and <b>absorption</b> <b>controlled</b> sorption. An investigation of the thermal behavior of radionuclide sorption on MST as shown by this data revealed the sorption process is diffusion (or transport) controlled (in solution). Transport in solution can in theory be accelerated by vigorous mixing but the range of available mixing speed in the facility design will probably not be sufficient to markedly increase radionuclide sorption rate on MST from diffusion-controlled sorption. The laboratory studies included mixing energies hydraulically-scaled to match those of the Actinide Removal Process and these likely approximate the range of energies available in the Salt Waste Processing Facility...|$|R

It is considerably denatured {{in the process and}} has a shorter half life when given intravenously than 131 I-labelled albumin. Nevertheless it is satisfactory for absorption studies, although not for turnover observations. These studies on <b>absorption</b> in <b>control</b> subjects and in patients with intestinal malabsorption indicate that the excreted radioactivity may have been derived from endogenous sources rather than from the results of malabsorption alone...|$|R
