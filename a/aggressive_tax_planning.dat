40|$|The use of tax {{treaties}} {{to obtain}} Double Non-Taxation for multinational firms {{as part of}} <b>aggressive</b> <b>tax</b> avoidance <b>planning</b> is not always ethical conduct for U.

The interpretational methods underlying the use of tax treaties to obtain Double Non-Taxation are explained in detail. Although tax treaty interpretation is an art and not a science, thus rendering wide discretion to the tax planner, there are ethical boundaries in using tax treaties to achieve Double Non-Taxation...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates {{anticipated}} <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> as {{an underlying}} source of value creation for acquirers’ shareholders. We hypothesize that merger announcement returns for acquirers reflect their shareholders’ {{beliefs about the}} future <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> performance of the merged firm. Our analyses show that, in acquisitions of more <b>tax</b> <b>aggressive</b> targets by less <b>tax</b> <b>aggressive</b> acquirers, acquirers’ merger announcement abnormal returns decrease as the tax aggressiveness of the acquirer decreases relative {{to that of the}} target. For acquisitions of less <b>tax</b> <b>aggressive</b> targets by more <b>tax</b> <b>aggressive</b> acquirers, acquirers’ merger announcement abnormal returns increase as the tax aggressiveness of the acquirer increases relative to that of the target, but is only observable when omitting deals in either extreme decile of the targets’ tax aggressiveness. These findings suggest that the market expects the target to adopt the acquirer’s <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> rather than benefiting from the more aggressive planning of either party, and that the anticipated <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> changes are positively associated with acquirer returns. Further, the results suggest that the merged firm’s overall <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> is easier to reduce than increase through the acquisition...|$|R
40|$|Unprecedented {{attention}} to <b>aggressive</b> international <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> has shaken the earth {{under the most}} powerful {{players in the world}} of international tax policy design. The media exposure of what Bloomberg 2 ̆ 7 s calls “The Great Corporate Tax Dodge,” combined with the ever-growing discontent of civil society with the magnitude of contribution of the largest multinational enterprises to the society within which they operate, has recently forced the politicians to take action. Leaders of the strongest world economies demanded a revision of the rules of the international tax regime that would generate more revenues for their challenged coffers and would restore public trust in the system. In what is now commonly known as the Base Erosion and Profit Sharing (“BEPS”) project, the OECD has established three principles: (1) promotion of collaborative rather than competition based solutions; (2) take a holistic view of the challenges and their corresponding solutions rather than an ad hoc approach; and (3) permit the consideration of innovative solutions even when they conflict with the traditional premises of the current international tax regime. This Article reviews the progress of the BEPS project and its compatibility with the fundamental principles for reform set by the OECD with a view to influence the discourse and the outcome of the project. This Article focuses on the importance of the paradigm shift from the current emphasis on competitiveness and the perfection of competition to a collaborative international tax regime, demonstrating the desirability of such a shift and suggesting how the OECD should go about making that shift...|$|R

40|$|Cloud {{computing}} has fundamentally changed how companies operate. Companies have quickly {{adapted by}} moving their businesses to the cloud, but international tax standards {{have failed to}} follow suit. As a result, taxpayers and tax administrations confront significant tax challenges in applying outdated tax principles to this new environment. One particular area that raises perplexing tax issues is the transfer pricing rules. The transfer pricing rules set forth the intercompany price a cloud service provider must charge an affiliate using its cloud services, which ultimately affects {{the determination of the}} jurisdiction in which the company’s profits are taxed. This Article argues that, {{due to the nature of}} the cloud, the current transfer pricing rules give U. S. multinational enterprises substantial freedom to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions and avoid tax in the United States in a practice commonly referred to as base erosion and profit shifting, or “BEPS. ” This type of <b>aggressive</b> international <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> has become a pressing problem worldwide that poses a serious risk to tax sovereignty, tax fairness, and the integrity of the corporate income tax. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) launched an action plan to address the BEPS problem, but the OECD’s work falls short of coming up with an innovative solution that will minimize the artificial shifting of profits abroad. In response, this Article recommends that, given the features of this new business environment, an international tax reform solution that adopts formulary apportionment or the profit-split methodology on a coordinated global basis would better address BEPS and minimize the undesirable policy results of our current transfer pricing rules...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} whether Norwegian PE-backed companies engage in <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> activities {{to a larger}} extent than their peers, and if PE-firms operating in Norway actively look for targets that hold a potential for tax optimization, by utilizing five proxies for <b>tax</b> <b>planning.</b> Our results show that Norwegian PE-backed companies exhibit significantly larger leverage ratios than comparable companies. The PE-backed companies’ leverage ratios are on average 100. 82 percentage points higher than the ratios of non-PE-backed companies. This indicates that PE-backed companies engage in <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> activities to a somewhat larger extent than their peers, by generating debt tax shields. We do although see limitations to this result, as we have not included holding company debt of the peer companies in our sample, and as we cast doubt over the relevance of using Leverage Ratio {{as a proxy for}} <b>tax</b> <b>planning.</b> In addition to this, none of the four other proxies for <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> we investigate display significant differences between the <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> activities performed in PE-backed companies and comparable non-PE-backed companies.

40|$|Abstract__ In this paper, we test empirically {{whether there}} is a {{relationship}} between corporate income taxes and CEO bonus payments. Using Compustat and ExecuComp data from 1992 to 2010, we find mixed results. Looking at the whole sample, the average bonus contract rewards tax savings excessively in comparison to other determinants of corporate net income. A possible ex- planation is that managers require to be compensated for the additional risk inherent in running an <b>aggressive</b> <b>tax</b> strategy. In accordance with previous lit- erature, we document a substantial heterogeneity in compensation practices across industries. It appears that our main result is driven by firms in the In- dustrial and Retail sectors. We further find that companies with greater <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> opportunities, for example by virtue of size or operations abroad, are more likely to condition the CEO’s bonus on corporate income taxes...|$|R

Using an agency framework, I analyze the manager's choice of effort dedication in other tasks and her explicit choice of the firm's tax risk. I show that corporate tax aggressiveness may decrease with compensation incentives. By choosing the tax risk, the manager (partly) determines her compensation risk. When the manager {{is assumed to be}} risk averse, an increase in compensation incentives motivates her to reduce her compensation risk through a less <b>aggressive</b> <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> strategy. Further, a good governance structure may mitigate this effect of incentive compensation when marginal returns for tax planning are sufficiently ciently low.

40|$|Internal control {{disclosures}} {{mandated by}} section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) {{are designed to}} provide information about a firm’s financial reporting quality and in doing so may offer information on firm-specific <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> activities. Internal control weaknesses disclosed under SOX are frequently related to a firm’s tax function (Ge and McVay, 2005; Gleason, Pincus and Rego, 2010) and thus raise {{the question of whether or}} not these frequent problems affect corporate tax avoidance. In this thesis, I test hypotheses that tax-related disclosures, particularly those that contain company-level internal control weaknesses (ICWs), provide information with respect to long-run tax avoidance. Furthermore, I test hypotheses that the combination of internal control quality and <b>aggressive</b> <b>tax</b> avoidance aid in assessing shareholder returns. To conduct these tests, I collect and construct firm-level SOX disclosure data from 2004 to 2006 across 1, 286 publicly-owned corporations. I begin with an empirical analysis of the association between tax avoidance and firm-level ICWs and generally find that the presence of tax ICWs and company-level tax ICWs constrain long-run tax avoidance. For firms with low cash constraints however, company-level tax ICWs appear to lead to an increase in tax avoidance. Nevertheless, subsequent analysis of monthly abnormal returns implies that the stock market reacts negatively to the disclosure of company-level tax ICWs, regardless of whether or not tax aggressiveness is also present. This thesis contributes to the literature by documenting the first evidence that internal control disclosures provide information regarding firm-level <b>tax</b> <b>planning.</b> Although the number of internal control weakness disclosures is decreasing over time, the availability of these SOX disclosures represents a previously unavailable opportunity to examine and further understand internal governance mechanisms within the firm and their influence on <b>tax</b> <b>planning.</b> In addition, this thesis further corroborates prior literature that argues for the importance of the pervasiveness of internal control weaknesses by showing that the pervasive, company-level tax internal control weaknesses are associated with tax avoidance and lower shareholder returns. Finally, my dissertation implies that the presence of tax internal control weaknesses constrains tax avoidance and thus a focus on improving internal controls could help improve the <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> function. However, my firm-level analysis also implies that effective <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> is a sustainable process and thus a firm and its stakeholders may require several periods before the full benefits of these improvements are realized...|$|R
30|$|The command-and-control {{paradigm}} {{has long}} prevailed among tax authorities fighting tax evasion {{and it is}} still the dominant paradigm in practice. However, at least since globally operating corporations engage in increasingly <b>aggressive</b> <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> and tax avoidance strategies rather than in illegal activities such as evasion, the limitations of the command-and-control paradigm have become evident. In 2008, the OECD Forum on Tax Administration (OECD 2008) developed the concept of “enhanced relationships”, later coined “cooperative compliance” (OECD 2013), in order to face the new challenges of globally interlaced taxation systems, such as <b>aggressive</b> <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> and flight to tax havens. Moreover, research in economic psychology and behavioral economics has contributed to rethinking public administration paradigms and has promoted the development of concepts such as “Good Public Governance”. The Austrian approach to “Good Public Governance” explicitly acknowledges the importance of cooperative relations and services (Ehrke-Rabel and Gunacker-Slawitsch 2014; Müller 2014).|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyse the methods used by multinational enterprises in the context of business restructurings to shift profits from high to low tax jurisdictions. Transactions between associated entities have generally been manipulated by applying non-arm’s length prices to these transactions, as well as devising agreements where the economic substance varies from the form of the transaction. The study aims to investigate some of the practical challenges faced by tax administrators in the application of the arm’s length principle. The study was conducted based on a literature review, as well as analysing specific examples reported in newspapers where multinational enterprises have used <b>aggressive</b> <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> schemes to shift profits. International case law was also analysed to evaluate some of the factors considered by the courts in the determination of the arm’s length price. It was found that multinational enterprises definitely use <b>aggressive</b> <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> schemes to shift profits. The practical challenges in the determination of arm’s length prices, complexity of the transactions involved, as well as a lack of resources, especially in the developing nations, are some of the factors that cause tax administrators to battle to find a solution to deter and detect these schemes. Other methods such as the unitary taxation method and the country by country reporting concept have been brought forward as alternatives to the arm’s length principle. These alternatives have been proposed in an effort to find a solution to the challenges posed by the arm’s length principle. Specific measures have also been recommended for developing nations’ tax administrators to resolve the issues that they currently experience in this context. Master...|$|E
