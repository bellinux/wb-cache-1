5|$|The {{views of}} Winckelmann on art {{encompassed}} {{the entirety of}} civilisation. He drew a parallel between a civilisation's general level of development {{and the evolution of}} its art. He interpreted this artistic evolution the same way that his contemporaries saw the life cycle of a civilisation, in terms of progress, apogee and then decline. For him, Greek <b>art</b> <b>had</b> been the pinnacle of artistic achievement, culminating with Phidias. Further, Winckelmann believed that the most beautiful works of Greek <b>art</b> <b>had</b> been produced under ideal geographic, political and religious circumstances. This frame of thought long dominated intellectual life in Europe. He classified Greek art into four periods: Ancient (archaic period), Sublime (Phidias), Beautiful (Praxiteles) and Decadent (Roman period).|$|E

5|$|People visiting {{or living}} in Rome or the cities {{throughout}} the Empire {{would have seen}} art {{in a range of}} styles and media on a daily basis. Public or official art—including sculpture, monuments such as victory columns or triumphal arches, and the iconography on coins—is often analysed for its historical significance or as an expression of imperial ideology. At Imperial public baths, a person of humble means could view wall paintings, mosaics, statues, and interior decoration often of high quality. In the private sphere, objects made for religious dedications, funerary commemoration, domestic use, and commerce can show varying degrees of aesthetic quality and artistic skill. A wealthy person might advertise his appreciation of culture through painting, sculpture, and decorative arts at his home—though some efforts strike modern viewers and some ancient connoisseurs as strenuous rather than tasteful. Greek <b>art</b> <b>had</b> a profound influence on the Roman tradition, and some of the most famous examples of Greek statues are known only from Roman Imperial versions and the occasional description in a Greek or Latin literary source.|$|E

50|$|Wind refers {{frequently}} to Hegel in isolating the particular change that <b>art</b> <b>has</b> undergone: “when <b>art</b> is removed to {{a zone of}} safety, it may still remain very good art indeed, and also very popular art, but its effect on our existence will vanish.” <b>Art</b> <b>has</b> thus, according to Wind, moved to life’s periphery. Again, Wind notes that this distance carries with it certain benefits for the scholarly approach to art; “detachment brought freshness and breadth, and a freedom from prejudice, a willingness to explore the unfamiliar, even the repulsive, and to risk new adventures of sensibility.” At the same time, however, <b>art</b> <b>has</b> lost its ability to resonate at levels deeper than the intellect, to incite the passions. Engaging with a work of <b>art</b> <b>has</b> become an act of mere observation as opposed to “vital participation.” <b>Art</b> <b>has,</b> for Wind, gained interest {{at the expense of}} potency.|$|R
