25|$|On March 20 8th-seeded Cincinnati and 9th-seeded Purdue {{squared off}} in the game prior to Kentucky and Hampton playing. The Bearcats outlasted the Boilermakers 66 to 65 in overtime. On March 22 Cincinnati and Kentucky met in Louisville for a berth to the Sweet 16. This was the first meeting between the two {{programs}} since the 2005 NCAA Tournament in which Kentucky won. The game was not as easy for the Wildcats like {{it was in the}} opening round game against Hampton. Kentucky shot just 37 percent and was outrebounded 45 to 38 yet always seemed in control because of timely baskets and rebounds that Cincinnati failed to get. The physical, pesky Bearcats made the Wildcats work hard for every shot and rebound in an intense contest. Yet the Wildcats succeeded by making life difficult on both ends for Cincinnati, holding the Bearcats to 32 percent shooting including just 24 percent in the second half. Kentucky blocked six shots after halftime and nine overall while <b>also</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> with key rebounds. Kentucky outlasted Cincinnati's physicality, defeating the Bearcats 64 to 51 en route to the Sweet 16.|$|E

The Famicom had more {{advanced}} hardware, allowing it to perform smoother scrolling and more colorful sprites, and Nintendo boosted its games library by courting third-party developers, whereas Sega was less than eager to collaborate with the same companies they were competing with in arcades. The SG-1000 was <b>also</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> against game consoles from companies including Tomy and Bandai.

2500|$|Three mines were laid, each of 50lb., {{and were}} {{successfully}} fired. Amass {{of the wreckage}} was thrown to a great height, the vessel's mainmast <b>also</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up.</b> An immense volume of water was thrown into the air, and, after matters had subsided, it was seen that vast numbers of fish of all sizes and descriptions were floating on the surface. A grand haul {{was made by the}} boats on the spot one of the largest fish picked up, familiarly known as a jewfish, was found to measure 7ft. in length. It is intended to send the divers down at daylight today, and as the mines were so placed as to blow the bottom out of the schooner, and so release the topsides and the deck, the hull should now be readily floated.

2500|$|Wright has {{described}} [...] "Stand for Your Rights", the album's advance single, as [...] "a call {{for people to}} change their paradigms and unite, {{a reaction to the}} Vietnam War, and the upheaval of social values at the time". According to Wright, he and Harrison [...] "structured the track together", with Harrison suggesting they add a gospel chorus [...] "to get the right vibe" [...] for the song, and <b>also</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> with Keys and Price's horn parts. Supporting Wright on the basic track, which was taped at Olympic Studios, Gordon and Keltner played drums, with Jerry Donahue and Allen on percussion, Harrison and McCracken on guitars, White on harpsichord and Voormann playing bass. London-based American soul singers Doris Troy, Madeline Bell, Nanette Newman and P.P. Arnold were among the backing vocalists, who recorded their parts the following day. Wright says he was confident that the song already sounded like a [...] "smash hit", but [...] "the icing on the cake" [...] was King Curtis' overdubbed saxophone solo. Curtis recorded his contribution in New York, playing various parts from which Wright and Johns then edited a composite solo.|$|E

2500|$|While Oudinot {{was engaged}} with Hohenzollern at Baumersdorf, to the west, Général de Division Jacques MacDonald, {{commander}} of the V Corps of the [...] "Army of Italy" [...] launched his men in {{an assault on the}} Wagram plateau. With the village of Baumersdorf in flames and a gentle breeze blowing from the east, the advance of the French troops was masked by heavy smoke. Dupas's division, temporarily attached to the [...] "Army of Italy", spearheaded this attack and, as chance would have it, happened to get between the Austrian 1st and II Korps and was thus free to advance unmolested on Deutsch-Wagram from the east. Attacking Dedovich's division at Deutsch-Wagram, Dupas's small Franco-Saxon division was soon supported by Lamarque's division, personally led by MacDonald, with the divisions of Seras, Durutte and Sahuc, all from Paul Grenier's VI Corps, <b>also</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> in support. Seeing the French advance, the Austrian artillerymen panicked and abandoned their guns, with the infantry regiments 35 and 47 (Vogelsang) also retreating in some disorder. General der Kavallerie Bellegarde intervened in person, maneuvering to refuse his flank to the enemy, with the French advance also faltering, due to heavy smoke. With visibility reduced, the French mistook the white uniforms of their Saxon allies from the Schützen and Grenadier battalions, believing them to be Austrians and promptly firing at them, which triggered a precipitated retreat of these men. With Archduke Charles now personally present to reestablish order, the morale of the Austrians soared and a vigorous joint attack by infantry regiment 42 (Erbach), joined by Hohenzollern's Vincent Chevaulegers and Hessen-Homburg Hussars repulsed the French attackers, pushing them beyond the Russbach and to their initial positions. Bellegarde's good maneuver and Archduke Charles's inspired intervention ensured a totally successful counterattack, and avoided what could have developed into a dangerous situation for the Austrian army. Opposite to them, both the Saxons, who had suffered high casualties, and the French troops were retreating in complete disorder and halted only near Raasdorf.|$|E

We beat them back handsomely, and Derwentwater with his cavalry charged their dragoons so fiercely that he drove them out of the town. It was late in the afternoon when the fight began, and all night the struggle went on. At each of our posts we beat them back over and over again. The town was on fire in half a dozen places, but luckily the night was still and the flames did not spread. We knew that it was a hopeless fight we were making; for, from some prisoners, we learned that three regiments of dragoons were <b>also</b> <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> against us, and had already arrived at Clitheroe. From some inhabitants, I suppose, the enemy learned that the street leading to Wigan had nor been barricaded, and Lord Forrester brought up Preston's regiment by this way, and suddenly fell on the flank of our barrier. It was a tough fight, but we held our own till the news came that Forster had agreed to capitulate.|$|E

60|$|On {{the morning}} of the 18th, Lyttleton and Hildyard's brigades moved forward to storm the precipitous peak, and Barton's brigade marched against the tangled and {{difficult}} ground that surrounded Green Hill. The Queen's on the right and the Scotch Fusiliers on the left led the attack against the peak. The hillside was partly wooded, but although the smokeless powder gave little indication as to the progress the troops were making, occasional glimpses of the Boers flitting among the trees showed that these were falling back. The roar of musketry was continuous, as Hildyard's brigade and Lyttleton's were both engaged. For a short time there was a pause, and then Lyttleton's men, having gathered {{at the edge of a}} wood some couple of hundred yards from the summit, advanced with a rush up the terribly steep rocks. The Boers fired hurriedly, but the bullets flew for the most part far over the heads of the Queen's, and then, fearful of being caught by Hildyard's men, who were <b>also</b> rapidly <b>coming</b> <b>up,</b> they fled hastily.|$|R

50|$|Ear {{position}} is often {{one of the}} most obvious behaviors that humans notice when interpreting horse body language. In general, a horse will direct the pinna of an ear toward the source of input it is also looking at. Horses have a narrow range of binocular vision, and thus a horse with both ears forward is generally concentrating on something in front of it. Similarly, when a horse turns both ears forward, the degree of tension in the horse's pinna suggests if the animal is calmly attentive to its surroundings or tensely observing a potential danger. However, because horses have strong monocular vision, it is possible for a horse to position one ear forward and one ear back, indicative of similar divided visual attention. This behavior is often observed in horses while working with humans, where they need to simultaneously focus attention on both their handler and their surroundings. A horse may turn the pinna back when <b>also</b> seeing something <b>coming</b> <b>up</b> behind it.|$|R
