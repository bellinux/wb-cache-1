5|$|A new {{committee}} {{was established in}} 1910, led by Mayor Sven Nilssen of Gjesdal, who was also director at Ålgårds Ullvarefabrikker. His company paid for traffic counting along the route, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> {{concluded that there was}} sufficient traffic to build a line. Two routes were proposed: one branching from Sandnes Station and one from Ganddal Station. The Ganddal alternative had lower investment costs, but would give higher operating costs; in 1913, investments were stipulated at NOK787,800. Although NSB's board supported the line, construction was placed on hold.|$|E
5|$|As the 1880 presidential {{elections}} approached, many Democrats remained convinced Tilden had been robbed {{of the presidency}} in 1876. In the House, Tilden supporter Clarkson Nott Potter of New York sought {{an investigation into the}} 1876 election in Florida and Louisiana, hoping that evidence of Republican malfeasance would harm that party's candidate in 1880. The Democratic caucus, including Randall, unanimously endorsed the idea, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> convened in May 1878. Some in the caucus wished to investigate the entire election, but Randall and the more moderate members worked to limit the committee's reach to the two disputed states.|$|E

Cahervillahow came home second despite trailing in fourth at the elbow, Romany King was third <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Committee</b> fourth.

5|$|Flanders's {{voting record}} in the Senate was more {{conservative}} than his senior colleague, George Aiken, and reflected Flanders's business orientation. In his second term, a Republican majority allowed Flanders to obtain seats on the Joint Economic Committee—this committee acted in an investigatory and advisory capacity to both Houses of the Congress—the Finance Committee <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> on Armed Services. These assignments reflected his interests as a senator.|$|E

The first session ended in a stalemate between Crown and Parliament over the abolition of Episcopacy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Committee</b> of the Articles, an unelected body used by the Scottish Crown to control legislation. Parliament refused to approve taxes or accept nominations for legal officers, closing the law courts.

5|$|No primary {{airports}} {{had been}} built in Helgeland by the mid-1960s. The coastal parts of the region, such as at Brønnøysund, were without highways and railways. Although Widerøe operated a seaplane route, it remained a summer-only service. Travel time to Sandnessjøen, where the closest hospital was located, took five hours. A committee, led by Erik Himle and later Preben Munthe, was appointed in 1962 to consider additional airports in Norway. The Sud Aviation Caravelle jet aircraft {{was about to be}} phased into use on the main domestic routes by Scandinavian Airlines System <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>committee</b> recommended in 1964 that nine new airports be built which could serve jetliners, including an airport in Sandnesssjøen.|$|E
