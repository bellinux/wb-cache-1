5|$|First of all, {{this was}} the 60th {{homicide}} in Newark this year, and I'm sure Congressman Tancredo has not opined <b>about</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the other homicides, and only became interested in this one {{when it became clear}} that one of the six alleged perpetrators came to this country illegally at the age of 11. That's one thing.|$|E
5|$|The {{need to keep}} {{information}} secret {{may also}} {{have contributed to the}} delays and the defenders' scepticism. As the auxiliary patrol boat crews, the indicator loop staff, and other personnel manning defensive positions would have been outside 'need to know' and would not have been informed <b>about</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the incidents prior to the attack, they would not have been alert, contributing to the disbelief demonstrated {{in the early hours of}} the attack.|$|E
5|$|Love's Last Shift {{is today}} read mainly {{to gain a}} {{perspective}} on Vanbrugh's sequel The Relapse, which has by contrast remained a stage favourite. Modern scholars often endorse the criticism that was levelled at Love's Last Shift from the first, namely {{that it is a}} blatantly commercial combination of sex scenes and drawn-out sentimental reconciliations. Cibber's follow-up comedy Woman's Wit (1697) was produced under hasty and unpropitious circumstances and had no discernible theme; Cibber, not usually shy <b>about</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> his plays, even elided its name in the Apology. It was followed by the equally unsuccessful tragedy Xerxes (1699). Cibber reused parts of Woman's Wit for The School Boy (1702).|$|E
40|$|Teaching about legal {{ethics is}} just like {{teaching}} <b>about</b> <b>any</b> other area <b>of</b> law. And teaching about legal ethics is different from teaching <b>about</b> <b>any</b> other area <b>of</b> law. Teaching about legal ethics is harder than teaching <b>about</b> <b>any</b> other area <b>of</b> law. And teaching about legal ethics is easier than teaching <b>about</b> <b>any</b> other area <b>of</b> law. Legal ethics was {{once thought to be}} among the least important things about which American legal educators teach. Today, legal ethics is regarded as a quite important thing about which to teach. Someday soon, I expect, legal ethics will be regarded as {{the most important thing about}} which American law schools teach. Where does this odd mix of observations lead? And what do they have to do with experience...|$|R

5|$|At 8:32a.m., FAA {{officials}} were notified Flight 11 had been hijacked and {{they in turn}} notified the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). NORAD scrambled two F-15s from Otis Air National Guard Base in Massachusetts and they were airborne by 8:53a.m. Because of slow and confused communication from FAA officials, NORAD had 9minutes' notice that Flight 11 had been hijacked, and no notice <b>about</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the other flights before they crashed. After both of the Twin Towers had already been hit, more fighters were scrambled from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia at 9:30a.m. At 10:20a.m. Vice President Dick Cheney issued orders to shoot down any commercial aircraft that could be positively identified as being hijacked. These instructions were not relayed {{in time for the}} fighters to take action. Some fighters took to the air without live ammunition, knowing that to prevent the hijackers from striking their intended targets, the pilots might have to intercept and crash their fighters into the hijacked planes, possibly ejecting at the last moment.|$|E

25|$|In January 1916, Stieglitz {{was shown}} a {{portfolio}} of charcoal drawings by a young artist named Georgia O'Keeffe.

The first that O'Keeffe heard <b>about</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> this was from another friend who saw her drawings in the gallery in late May of that year.

25|$|In {{contrast}} to Schaeffer's own {{experience as a}} single child of a father with a third-grade education and a depressed mother, {{he grew up with}} a drive to understand reality in its complexity, including the glorious and tragic human realities. He was deeply engaged in the lives of each of his four children, continuously available to them, showing and explaining art, history, city and country life, philosophy, Roman ruins and medieval and Renaissance efforts to civilize a damaged human history. He enjoyed watching people, engaging them in conversation and showing his children the joy and tragedy of human existence. He laid out for them the philosophic foundations of societies without being idealistic <b>about</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> them.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{contract was}} for the game be completed within 18 months. In the course of its development, the game was nearly canceled twice: {{in the first instance}} due to the company's financial difficulties, and the second time under the pressure from Spectrum HoloByte after it had acquired Bill Stealey’s shares in MicroProse in 1993. Julian Gollop said the quality assurance team (Andrew Lucket, Phil McDonnel, and Jason Thompson) helped save the game from cancellation; their feedback also helped to polish the game. The game was in fact officially ordered to be canceled by Spectrum HoloByte, but MicroProse UK bosses Pete Moreland, Adrian Parr, and Paul Hibbard held a meeting and decided to ignore it and simply not inform Gollop <b>about</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> that. Thus, the development team continued their work without any knowledge of the parent company's executives, until it was eventually completed in March 1994, after 30 months in development since the initial contract. During the final three months, after Spectrum HoloByte was eventually informed of the game still being in production, the Gollop brothers were forced to work 7–12 in order to finish it {{before the end of the}} fiscal year. The overall development of the PC version cost £115,000.|$|E
25|$|One such {{story is}} that of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi. The rabbi, a friend of Elijah’s, was asked what favor he might wish. The rabbi {{answered}} only that {{he be able to}} join Elijah in his wanderings. Elijah granted his wish only if he refrained from asking any questions <b>about</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> the prophet’s actions. He agreed and they began their journey. The first place they came to was the house of an elderly couple who were so poor they had only one old cow. The old couple gave of their hospitality as best they could. The next morning, as the travelers left, Elijah prayed that the old cow would die and it did. The second place they came to was the home of a wealthy man. He had no patience for his visitors and chased them away with the admonition that they should get jobs and not beg from honest people. As they were leaving, they passed the man’s wall {{and saw that it was}} crumbling. Elijah prayed that the wall be repaired and it was so. Next, they came to a wealthy synagogue. They were allowed to spend the night with only the smallest of provisions. When they left, Elijah prayed that every member of the synagogue might become a leader.|$|E

The song is about yearning to rebuild a failed relationship and was interpreted by critics as being about Brown's former relationship with Barbadian singer Rihanna.
