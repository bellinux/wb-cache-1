Mick Quinn tried to {{describe}} the concept: [...] "There's {{a few people who}} are just really out there. There's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> Oxford who are real spliffheads and that, who go and lie down in Port Meadow, but I'm not really sure about them. I'm not really sure that they're individuals: they're part of a much larger thing."

500|$|Following the election, Ann Romney {{received}} {{an offer to}} appear on the spring 2013 season of Dancing with the Stars, but although she was a fan of the show, she declined: [...] "I would've loved to have done it, and I am turning 64, and I started thinking about it. I'm not really as flexible as I should be." [...] She still mourned the election loss, perhaps more than her husband did. [...] In a late February 2013 interview, she said, [...] "And you know, the other part of it was an amazing thing, and it was really quite a lot of energy and a lot of passion and a lot of – <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> us and all of a sudden, it was nothing," [...] then adding, [...] "But the good news is we like each other." [...] In October 2013, she published, and made promotional appearances for, The Romney Family Table: Sharing Home-Cooked Recipes & Favorite Traditions, a cookbook that made the New York Times Best Seller list.|$|E
500|$|As the storyline developed, it {{held the}} {{potential}} to ruin the positive changes that the character had achieved. Halfpenny said Amy had become really close to Val and Eric. They are in a [...] "good place" [...] and they think [...] "Amy's all happy." [...] The one person she wants to tell is Val, with whom she shares the closest bond and shes [...] "gutted" [...] to remain silent. It prevents them from having a normal parent/child relationship, as the truth would ruin her one last chance. Halfpenny said her portrayal turns Amy to a [...] "dark place" [...] as she is [...] "too young to be coping with something like this." [...] As Amy becomes preoccupied with fear in case Cain finds out, Halfpenny said it makes Amy do [...] "something dangerous." [...] Though, Amy has Victoria {{to fall back on}} and is described as [...] "her rock". Emmerdale series producer Stuart Blackburn said the storyline would change the lives of <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> Amy. At times he said the narrative is [...] "truly heart breaking" [...] and dangerous. [...] "I think it's going to change perceptions of Amy [...] we’re going to start to understand Amy an awful lot more." ...|$|E

500|$|Since 1978, Gabriel had {{composed}} all of {{his music}} at Ashcombe House, including his fourth studio album Peter Gabriel or [...] "Security" [...] (1982) and the Birdy (1984) soundtrack. An inexpensive studio existed in the house's adjacent barn, consisting of two rooms, one where Gabriel would produce his vocals and work on lyrics, and another where the music would be assembled. When preparing for So, Gabriel considered Chic's Nile Rodgers and Bill Laswell as potential producers. He eventually asked his Birdy collaborator, Daniel Lanois, to stay at Ashcombe and work with him further. Rehearsals began in May 1985 and consisted of Gabriel, Lanois and guitarist David Rhodes. Gabriel had begun work on some songs and provided Lanois and Rhodes with chord structures, around which they built their own improvised compositions. Lanois recalled they had [...] "a nice starting point [...] {{in that kind of}} scenario, it's {{not a good idea to}} have <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> because you get nervous that you're wasting other people's time". Consequently, there was a relaxed atmosphere surrounding these sessions and the trio would jokingly refer to themselves as The Three Stooges, an American vaudeville act of the mid-twentieth century. This also involved the wearing of construction site hard hats as they had a [...] "turning up for work humour". As sessions grew, engineer Kevin Killen, bassist Tony Levin, and drummer Jerry Marotta became significant contributors, and were aided by percussionists Manu Katché and Stewart Copeland and violinist L. Shankar.|$|E

The bass line had been milked through the Moog machine and, lo and high, we behold electronic music …" [...] The inside sleeve included a quotation attributed to [...] "Arthur Wax": [...] "There are <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>around,</b> making a lot of noise; here's some more." ...|$|E
2500|$|U.S. sources told The Washington Post in 1985 {{that the}} LaRouche {{organization}} had assembled a worldwide network {{of government and}} military contacts, and that his researchers sometimes supplied information to government officials. Bobby Ray Inman, the CIA's deputy director in 1981 and 1982, said LaRouche {{and his wife had}} visited him offering information about the West German Green Party, and a CIA spokesman said LaRouche met Deputy Director John McMahon in 1983 to discuss one of LaRouche's trips overseas. An aide to William Clark said when LaRouche's associates discussed technology or economics, they made good sense and seemed to be qualified. Norman Bailey, formerly with the National Security Council, said in 1984 that LaRouche's staff comprised [...] "one of the best private intelligence services in the world[...] [...] [...] They do know <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> the world.

2500|$|Following the {{expansion}} of his role from turntablist to keyboardist on Light Grenades (2006), Chris Kilmore stated that, during the band's hiatus, he [...] "took a lot of piano lessons and {{did a lot of}} learning keyboards. I made a lot of music, but it just sits at home, it’s not for everybody, it’s just for me as a learning process. A lot of practicing, I’d be playing music every single day, keys every single day. I was scratching a little bit, but mostly keys, because my role in this band has kind of evolved. So to pick up a new instrument and learn it in a few years was hard to do. [...] I’m really serious and focused about it, that’s what the rehearsals are for, hitting all those wrong notes. But I have questions, and there is <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> me that I can ask, Ben is an incredible musician, Mike is an incredible musician and composer, and if I need something explained or helped with, I don’t have to go far to get an answer." ...|$|E

5000|$|The final track, [...] "Vampire Money", was a {{reaction}} to the band being asked to do a song for the Twilight franchise. Gerard Way said that the reason the song was on the album was because [...] "there’s a lot of people chasing that fucking money. ‘Twilight?’ <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> us were like, ‘please, for the love of God, do this fucking movie.’ But we’d moved on." ...|$|E
