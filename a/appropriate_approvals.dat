5|$|In 1980, a Flint-area {{politician}} {{wanted to}} dedicate a highway after the United Auto Workers (UAW). As a result, the David Dunbar Buick Freeway name was moved off I-475 {{and applied to}} I-69 in Flint. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved {{the extension of the}} I-69 designation eastward in 1983 so that it would terminate at the international boundary at Port Huron; this approval was contingent on construction of the roadway to Interstate Highway standards and other <b>appropriate</b> <b>approvals</b> at the federal government level. The remaining segment of freeway connecting Lapeer with Wadhams opened in 1984 as I-69 and several additional changes were made to the highway system at the same time. M-21 was shortened to Flint and replaced M-56 through the city. The former route of M-21 in Port Huron became BLI-69, and the remainder of that highway was turned back to local control. The I-69 designation was officially extended once more under Congressional legislation on February 10, 1987; this last extension designated I-69 all the way to I-94 in Port Huron to reflect the 1984 openings.|$|E
