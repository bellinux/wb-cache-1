50|$|Once {{the desired}} {{operation}} of a circuit has been described using RTL operations, the datapath components may be derived. Every unique variable that is assigned a value in the RTL program can be implemented as <b>a</b> <b>register.</b> Depending on the functional operation performed when assigning a value to <b>a</b> variable, the <b>register</b> for that variable may be implemented as <b>a</b> straightforward <b>register,</b> <b>a</b> shift <b>register,</b> <b>a</b> counter, or <b>a</b> <b>register</b> preceded by <b>a</b> combinational logic block. The combinational logic block associated with <b>a</b> <b>register</b> may implement <b>an</b> adder, subtracter, multiplexer, or some other type of combinational logic function.|$|R

5000|$|In most {{register}} allocators, {{each variable}} {{is assigned to}} either <b>a</b> CPU <b>register</b> or to main memory. The advantage of using <b>a</b> <b>register</b> is speed. Computers have {{a limited number of}} registers, so not all variables can be assigned to <b>registers.</b> <b>A</b> [...] "spilled variable" [...] is a variable in main memory rather than in <b>a</b> CPU <b>register.</b> The operation of moving a variable from <b>a</b> <b>register</b> to memory is called spilling, while the reverse operation of moving a variable from memory to <b>a</b> <b>register</b> is called filling. For example, a 32-bit variable spilled to memory gets 32 bits of stack space allocated and all references to the variable are then to that memory. Such a variable has a much slower processing speed than a variable in <b>a</b> <b>register.</b> When deciding which variables to spill, multiple factors are considered: execution time, code space, data space.|$|R
40|$|<b>A</b> <b>register</b> {{specification}} typically {{states that}} in each cycle {{there is a}} possible read followed by a possible write; the sequence is strict. <b>A</b> <b>register</b> core with <b>a</b> separate read and write port is more efficient, because it can read and write to different locations simultaneously, and hence in one cycle. In the Caltech MiniMIPS processor, a control structure was added to such <b>a</b> <b>register</b> core, so that it implements the desired specification...|$|R
5|$|St Nazaire {{was one of}} the 38 battle honours {{presented}} to the Commandos after the war. The raid has since been called The Greatest Raid of All. The survivors formed their own association, the St Nazaire Society, which is <b>a</b> <b>registered</b> charity in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Telopea 'Shade of Pale' is {{an unusual}} pale-pink flowered form of T.speciosissima. It is less {{vigorous}} than the parent plant. It was initially promoted as 'Light Shade of Pale' but there can only be three words in <b>a</b> <b>registered</b> cultivar name.|$|E
5|$|The first Brahmousin cattle were {{produced}} from a multiple embryo transfer from a French-imported Limousin dam. The resulting progeny were then crossed with Brahman cattle {{to achieve an}} F1 hybrid. Further crosses over a broader base led {{to the production of}} the 5/8 Limousin – 3/8 Brahman Brahmousin purebred, a mix which {{has been found to be}} the most widely accepted and most useful for the majority of the USA. The American Brahmousin Council allows animals that are not purebred to be recorded as percentage animals as long as they are at least one-quarter Limousin and one-quarter Brahman. In order to be recorded as a purebred Brahmousin, the animal must then be sired by <b>a</b> <b>registered</b> purebred or fullblood Limousin bull, registered Brahman bull or <b>a</b> <b>registered</b> purebred Brahmousin bull.|$|E

5000|$|The x86 {{processor}} {{also includes}} complex addressing modes for addressing memory with an immediate offset, <b>a</b> <b>register,</b> <b>a</b> <b>register</b> with <b>an</b> offset, <b>a</b> scaled <b>register</b> {{with or without}} an offset, and <b>a</b> <b>register</b> with <b>an</b> optional offset and another scaled register. So for example, one can encode [...] as a single instruction which loads 32 bits of data from the address computed as [...] offset from the [...] selector, and stores it to the [...] register. In general x86 processors can load and use memory matched {{to the size of}} any register it is operating on. (The SIMD instructions also include half-load instructions.) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{technique}} uses a {{directed graph}} where the vertices represent asynchronous combinational blocks and the directed edges represent <b>a</b> series of <b>registers</b> or latches (the number of registers or latches can be zero). Each vertex has a value {{corresponding to the}} delay through the combinational circuit it represents. After doing this, one can attempt to optimize the circuit by pushing registers from output to input and vice versa - much like bubble pushing. Two operations can be used - deleting <b>a</b> <b>register</b> from each input of a vertex while adding <b>a</b> <b>register</b> to all outputs, and conversely adding <b>a</b> <b>register</b> to each input of vertex and deleting <b>a</b> <b>register</b> from all outputs. In all cases, if the rules are followed, the circuit {{will have the same}} functional behavior as it did before retiming.|$|R
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet is {{a medical}} nutrition therapy that involves participants from various disciplines. Team members include <b>a</b> <b>registered</b> paediatric dietitian who coordinates the diet programme; a paediatric neurologist who is experienced in offering the ketogenic diet; and <b>a</b> <b>registered</b> nurse who is familiar with childhood epilepsy. Additional help may come from a medical social worker who works with the family and a pharmacist who can advise on the carbohydrate content of medicines. Lastly, the parents and other caregivers must be educated in {{many aspects of the}} diet for it to be safely implemented.|$|E
5|$|The senior {{registrant}} {{in such a}} proceeding has ample {{incentive to}} oppose the grant of a concurrent use registration, because <b>a</b> <b>registered</b> trademark is presumed to apply throughout the entire United States. Thus, the grant of a concurrent use registration carves out some geographic territory from the senior registrant's exclusive control.|$|E

In March 1890 Samuel Webster & Sons became <b>a</b> <b>registered</b> company with £175,000 (£17.5million in 2010) of capital and Isaac Webster, Samuel's eldest son, its first chairman. In 1892 net profit was £20,000 (£2million in 2010). In 1896 the company took over H & T T Ormerod of Brighouse, West Yorkshire which could trace its origins back to 1760. Isaac Webster died in 1899, leaving an estate of £87,454 (£9million). By 1900 the company's office had moved to 57 Northgate, Halifax.|$|E
25|$|Conditional {{branches}} {{test whether}} the {{least significant bit}} of <b>a</b> <b>register</b> is set or clear, or compare <b>a</b> <b>register</b> as <b>a</b> signed quadword to zero, and branch if the specified condition is true. The conditions available for comparing <b>a</b> <b>register</b> to zero are equality, inequality, less than, {{less than or equal}} to, greater than or equal to, and greater than. The new address is computed by longword aligning and sign extending the 21-bit displacement and adding it to the address of the instruction following the conditional branch.|$|R
50|$|Without <b>a</b> <b>register</b> like <b>an</b> accumulator, {{it would}} be {{necessary}} to write the result of each calculation (addition, multiplication, shift, etc.) to main memory, perhaps only to be read right back again for use in the next operation. Access to main memory is slower than access to <b>a</b> <b>register</b> like the accumulator because the technology used for the large main memory is slower (but cheaper) than that used for <b>a</b> <b>register.</b> Early electronic computer systems were often split into two groups, those with accumulators and those without.|$|R
