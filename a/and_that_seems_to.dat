500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly {{mixed reviews}} from critics, with many {{commenting on the}} episode's reliance on humor. In a review of part one, a critic from the Knight Ridder wrote, [...] "As disorienting as this body transfer had to be for Mulder, the experience provided amusing television. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> {{be a problem for}} some X-Files fans. Knowing that the human population's survival is imperiled by the colonization plans of a fierce extraterrestrial race, a large number of X-Philes want the show to focus on our heroes' efforts to come to the rescue". The newspaper's review of Part 2 was much more negative, with the article saying [...] "by the end of the latest X-Files episode, we were wishing we could push a reset button on Dreamland II, just to forget some of the silly stuff that transpired in this show". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five and noted that the episode lacked [...] "structure and point". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave both episodes mixed reviews, awarding the first part two-and-a-half stars out of four, and the second part two stars. Vitaris was unhappy with the amount of comedy used in the episode, noting that once Mulder visited Fletcher's house, [...] "the comedy turns sour": she argued that the members of Fletcher's family were examples of caricatures. Despite this, she praised the scene featuring the murder of the gas station attendant, claiming that [...] "for a moment, this episode really clicks". Vitaris, in her review for part two, called the episode [...] "purely illogical", although she noted it did feature [...] "minor fun", pointing out the scene wherein Scully catches Fletcher by handcuffing him.|$|E
2500|$|On October 7, 2007, the Catholic League {{called for}} a boycott of the film. League {{president}} William A. Donohue {{said he would not}} ordinarily object to the film, but that while the religious elements are diluted from the source material, the film will encourage children to read the novels, which he says denigrate Christianity and promote atheism for children. He cited Pullman telling the Washington Post in 2001 that he is trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief. The League hoped that [...] "the film [...] to meet box office expectations and that [...] books attract few buyers", declaring the boycott campaign a success after a North American opening weekend which was lower than anticipated. One week after the film's release, Roger Ebert said of the campaign, [...] "any bad buzz on a family film can be mortal, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have been the case this time." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He was {{the most}} {{troublesome}} fellow on the line once, although he was the biggest worker," [...] the boss replied. [...] "He got {{five years in the}} penitentiary <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> have taken the spirit out of him." ...|$|E

No girl could love a man with three times the proper amount of face." ...|$|R
500|$|His {{treatment}} of dancers was sometimes caustic. Choreographer Hermes Pan recalled in 1972 interview that Prinz [...] "would make some girls hysterical. He {{loved to have}} them in tears. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be the thing, to swear at the girls and be nasty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, my dear girl, I've got no business. I'm {{making up}} my mind, you see, {{and do the}} {{ornamental}} while I'm deciding. There always ought to be one gentleman in a family, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be rather my line," [...] answered Charlie, posing for the character with an assumption of languid elegance {{which would have been}} very effective if his twinkling eyes had not spoilt it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, then," [...] said I, [...] "paper me, if you please, paper Alan, paper King George! We're {{all three}} innocent, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be what's wanted.

6000|$|... "Katharine," [...] she said, lifting {{it in the}} air, [...] "I've {{just made}} out such a queer, strange thing about your grandfather. I'm three years and six months older than {{he was when he}} died. I couldn't very well have been his mother, but I might have been his elder sister, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> me such a {{pleasant}} fancy. I'm going to start quite fresh this morning, and get a lot done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you want}} really to know, then--can't you see <b>that</b> your remorse <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me {{connected}} {{in a certain}} way with your affection; a sort of guarantee of it? You thought you had injured some one or other, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be mixed up with your loving me, and therefore I let it alone." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Mr Westlock, we {{have met}} only once before, but you have known Tom a long while, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> render you {{familiar}} to me. I cannot talk freely with you on any subject unless I relieve my mind of what oppresses it just now. I see with pain that you so far mistrust me that you think me likely to impose on Tom's regardlessness of himself, or on his kind nature, or some of his good qualities.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am very glad," [...] she replied, simply. [...] "Sometimes I get discouraged. I {{speak and}} people applaud, and I go away, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be {{all there is}} to it. I never hear a word afterwards; but once in a while, some one comes to me or writes to me, as you have done, and that gives me courage to go on; {{otherwise}} I'd think people came to hear me simply to be amused." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You take {{advantage}} of a hasty word of mine,' said Bella with a little sting of self-reproach, 'to make me seem--I don't know what. I spoke without consideration when I used it. If that was bad, I am sorry; but you repeat it after consideration, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> me to be at least no better. For the rest, I beg it may be understood, Mr Rokesmith, that there is an end of this between us, now and for ever.' ...|$|E
60|$|He turned away, and Ruth pondered {{what she}} had heard. It was plain that her father shrank from {{offending}} Clay; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> confirm the vague but unpleasant suspicions she had entertained about their business relations.

6000|$|... "I hope I shall be, Polly, but {{you know}} they say that in families, {{if there is a}} boy who can't do {{anything}} else, they make a minister of him. I sometimes think I ain't good for much, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> me the reason why I should n't even try to be a minister," [...] said Will, smiling, yet looking as if with all his humility he did have faith in the aspirations that came to him in his best moments.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't say it {{interests}} me much," [...] said the Irishman frankly, [...] "especially {{as it seems}} pretty plain now. Apparently Brayne hated this stranger for some reason; lured him into the garden, and killed him with my sword. Then he fled to the city, tossing the sword away as he went. By the way, Ivan tells me the dead man had a Yankee dollar in his pocket. So he was a countryman of Brayne's, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> clinch it.

6000|$|Our inn, the [...] "Hotel of the Post," [...] {{a spacious}} and {{comfortable}} residence, is {{on a little}} place planted round with trees, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> be the Palais Royal of the town. Three clubs, which look from without to be very comfortable, ornament this square with their gas-lamps. Here stands, too, the theatre that is to be; there is a cafe, and on evenings a military band plays the very worst music I ever remember to have heard. I went out to-night to take a quiet walk upon this place, and the horrid brazen discord of these trumpeters set me half mad.|$|E
50|$|Lady Ranelagh {{is known}} for her genius in medicine.

60|$|Somebody felt {{cautiously}} {{under the}} sofa. I recognized {{the shoes of}} Weeks, the butler.

500|$|Despite {{the success}} of the serial, Kneale felt that he had now taken the {{character}} of Quatermass as far as he could. [...] "I didn't want to go on repeating because Professor Quatermass had already saved the world from ultimate destruction three times, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> me to be quite enough," [...] he said in 1986. It was also his final new collaboration with Rudolph Cartier, although the director did later handle a new version of Kneale's 1953 adaptation of Wuthering Heights for the BBC in 1962.|$|R
