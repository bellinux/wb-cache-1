5|$|Alexios had {{anticipated}} {{help in the}} form of mercenary forces from the West, but he was totally unprepared for the immense and undisciplined force that soon arrived in Byzantine territory. It was no comfort to Alexios to learn that four of the eight leaders of {{the main body of the}} Crusade were Normans, among them Bohemund. Since the crusade had to pass through Constantinople, however, the Emperor had some control over it. He required its leaders to swear to restore to the empire any towns or territories they might reconquer from the Turks on their way to the Holy Land. In return, he gave them guides <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> escort.|$|E

5|$|On August 13, 1898, the Treaty of Paris {{transferred}} {{possession of}} Puerto Rico from Spain to the United States <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> government was established. In 1899, Muñoz Rivera resigned his {{position within the}} cabinet and remained inactive in politics for some time. In 1909, he was elected as Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico and participated {{in the creation of}} the Jones-Shafroth Act, proposing amendments before its final approval. Shortly after, Muñoz Rivera contracted an infection and traveled to Puerto Rico, where he died on November 15, 1916. His son, Luis Muñoz Marín would subsequently become involved in politics, becoming the first democratically elected Governor of Puerto Rico.|$|E

The resultant distinctive Darjeeling tea is internationally recognised and ranks among the most popular black teas in the world.|$|E

5|$|The {{return of}} {{democracy}} and government reforms beginning in 1986 were hampered by national debt, government corruption, coup attempts, disasters, a persistent communist insurgency, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> conflict with Moro separatists. During Corazon Aquino's administration, U.S. forces withdrew from the Philippines, due to {{the rejection of the}} U.S. Bases Extension Treaty, and leading to the official transfer of Clark Air Base in November 1991 and Subic Bay to the government in December 1992. The administration also faced a series of natural disasters, including the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991. After introducing a constitution that limited presidents to a single term, Aquino did not stand for re-election.|$|E

5|$|American {{officials}} {{decided to}} release the prisoners after a few weeks. First, however, the Natives were required to visit several large U.S. cities on the east coast. This was a tactic often used when Native American leaders came to the East, because {{it was thought that}} a demonstration of the size and power of the United States would discourage future resistance to U.S. expansion. Beginning on June 4, 1833, Black Hawk and his companions were taken on a tour of Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. They attended dinners and plays, and were shown a battleship, various public buildings, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> parade. Huge crowds gathered to see them. Black Hawk's handsome son Nasheweskaska (Whirling Thunder) was a particular favorite. Reaction in the west, however, was less welcoming. When the prisoners traveled through Detroit on their way home, one crowd burned and hanged effigies of the Indians.|$|E
5|$|As Osijek grew as a city, the fort's {{presence}} hindered {{the potential}} for urban development. The demolition {{of most of the}} fort walls happened between 1923 and 1926, with the construction of an electric tramway. The last gunpowder magazine, located behind the church of St. Michael, was demolished in 1958. While most of the fortifications have been demolished (only the first and eighth bastions and the northern wall with its so-called 'water gate' were kept), the center of Tvrđa remains intact. The Yugoslav People's Army maintained a garrison <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> hospital in Tvrđa, but in the 1980s these buildings were gradually being abandoned, and adapted into ateliers for local painters and sculptors.|$|E
5|$|By 13 February 1942, the Japanese {{had already}} reached Pasir Panjang Ridge (present Kent Ridge Park) after {{destroying}} the Allied artillery force on Chwee Chian Hill (where Poh Ern Shih Temple stands today). This location {{was near the}} Alexandra area where the main ammunition stores <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> hospital were situated. The men of the 1st Battalion, Charlie Company, Malay Regiment, led by Lieutenant Adnan Bin Saidi fought bravely to the last. Many Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. The guns from Labrador assisted the Malay Regiment in their 48-hour struggle against the Japanese by firing high-explosive shells at enemy troops. However, with Japanese reinforcements, the Malay Regiment were finally surrounded and massacred. Three lucky ones, together with Lieutenant Abbas Abdul-Manan managed to escape and later rejoined 30 surviving soldiers of a British battalion in the nearby area.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of Funeral (2004), which had been {{recorded}} in an attic studio known as Hotel2Tango, Arcade Fire decided a permanent recording location was necessary. Following their tour in support of Funeral, the band bought the Petite Église in Farnham, Quebec. Being used as a café {{at the time of}} purchase, the Petite Église had once been a church and a Masonic Temple. Once renovation of the church was complete, the band spent the latter half of 2006 recording a majority of the album there. Michael Pärt produced additional recordings in Budapest, recording the Budapest Film Orchestra <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> men's choir. Other sessions included one in New York, where the band recorded along the Hudson River to be near water.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert de Clare, 8th Earl of Gloucester, 7th Earl of Hertford, 10th Lord of Clare, 5th Lord of Glamorgan (c. 10May 1291 – 24June 1314) was an English nobleman <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> {{commander}} in the Scottish Wars. In contrast to most English earls at the time, his main focus lay {{in the pursuit of}} war rather than in domestic political strife. He was the son of Gilbert de Clare, 7th Earl of Gloucester, and Joan of Acre, daughter of EdwardI. The older Gilbert died when his son was only four years old, and the younger Gilbert was invested with his earldoms at the young age of sixteen. Almost immediately, he became involved in the defence of the northern border, but later he was drawn into the struggles between EdwardII and some of his barons. He was one of the Lords Ordainers who ordered the expulsion of the king's favourite Piers Gaveston in 1311. When Gaveston was killed on his return in 1312, Gloucester helped negotiate a settlement between the perpetrators and the king.|$|E
5|$|In August 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany {{signed the}} Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, in which Eastern European {{countries}} {{were divided into}} spheres of interest; Finland belonged to the Soviet sphere of interest.

The Soviet Union demanded territories on the Karelian Isthmus, the islands of the Gulf of Finland <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> base near the Finnish capital Helsinki, similar to the demands presented in the previous years. The Finns again refused, and the Red Army attacked on 30 November 1939. Simultaneously, Stalin set up a puppet government for the Finnish Democratic Republic, headed by the Finnish communist Otto Wille Kuusinen.|$|E
