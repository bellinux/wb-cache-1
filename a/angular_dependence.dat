25|$|If a hot {{emitting}} body {{is assumed}} to follow the Stefan–Boltzmann law and its power emission P and temperature T are known, this law {{can be used to}} estimate the dimensions of the emitting object, because the total emitted power is proportional to the area of the emitting surface. In this way it was found that X-ray bursts observed by astronomers originated in neutron stars with a radius of about 10km, rather than black holes as originally conjectured. It should be noted that an accurate estimate of size requires some knowledge of the emissivity, particularly its spectral and <b>angular</b> <b>dependence.</b>|$|E

25|$|Early {{attempts}} to quantitatively describe the electromagnetic force {{were made in}} the mid-18th century. It was proposed that the force on magnetic poles, by Johann Tobias Mayer and others in 1760, and electrically charged objects, by Henry Cavendish in 1762, obeyed an inverse-square law. However, in both cases the experimental proof was neither complete nor conclusive. It was not until 1784 when Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, using a torsion balance, was able to definitively show through experiment that this was true. Soon after the discovery in 1820 by H. C. Ørsted that a magnetic needle is acted on by a voltaic current, André-Marie Ampère that same year was able to devise through experimentation the formula for the <b>angular</b> <b>dependence</b> of the force between two current elements. In all these descriptions, the force was always given in terms of the properties of the objects involved and the distances between them rather than in terms of electric and magnetic fields.|$|E

40|$|A {{collection}} of results is presented relevant {{for the analysis}} of azimuthal asymmetries in inclusive two-hadron production at BELLE. The aim of this overview is to provide theoretical ingredients necessary to extract the Collins effect fragmentation function. The latter arises within the Collins-Soper factorization formalism, which describes both the transverse momentum and Q^ 2 dependence of the cross section and its <b>angular</b> <b>dependences</b> at low and moderate transverse momentum. Since the Collins effect is not the only source of <b>angular</b> <b>dependences,</b> a discussion of various other effects is included. This concerns higher twist contributions, photon-Z-boson interference effects, radiative corrections, beam polarization and weak decays. Furthermore, different frames, transverse momentum weighting and ratios of asymmetries are discussed. These issues are all of relevance for the unambiguous measurement of the Collins effect.

40|$|The {{transverse}} ultrasound absorption in cubic crystals {{with positive}} and negative anisotropies of the second-order elasticity moduli is analyzed. The scattering of the ultrasound by defects and during anharmonic scattering processes is considered. The transverse ultrasound absorption is analyzed {{as a function of}} the wave-vector direction in terms of the anisotropic continuum model. The Landau-Rumer mechanism is considered for anharmonic scattering processes. Known values of the second- and third-order elasticity moduli are used to calculate parameters determining the ultrasound absorption. It is shown that the <b>angular</b> <b>dependences</b> of the transverse ultrasound absorption differ qualitatively if the anharmonic scattering processes dominate in cubic crystals with {{positive and negative}} anisotropies of the second-order elasticity moduli. For the scattering by defects and the anharmonic scattering processes, the <b>angular</b> <b>dependences</b> of the transverse ultrasound absorption exhibit the inverse behavior, making it possible to determine the dominating mechanism of the ultrasound relaxation in the crystals under study.

The positron and electron induced ratios are analyzed to provide information about how first- and second-order double ionization mechanisms interfere and contribute to the differential {{electron emission}}. Experimental data has shown large, roughly factor of two, differences in the total double ionization cross sections resulting from medium to fast positive and negative particle impact, e. g., for positrons and electrons as well as for protons and antiprotons. In both cases, the total cross sections for negative particle impact are larger. See ref. 1. McGuire explained this difference by noting that two different mechanisms can lead to doubl...|$|R

Thus there is an optimum angle of detection [...] for each particle size. A high quality analysis should always be performed at several scattering angles (multiangle DLS). This becomes even more important in a polydisperse sample with an unknown particle size distribution. At certain angles the scattering intensity of some particles will completely overwhelm the weak scattering signal of other particles, thus making them invisible to the data analysis at this angle. DLS instruments which only work at a fixed angle can only deliver good results for some particles. Thus the indicated precision of a DLS instrument with only one detection angle is only ever true for certain particles.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the anisotropy of the thermal radiation emitted by a surface {{element of a}} neutron star atmosphere (e. g., by a polar cap of a radio pulsar). <b>Angular</b> <b>dependences</b> of the partial fluxes at various photon energies, and spectra at various angles are obtained for different values of the effective temperature T(sub eff) and magnetic field strength B, and for different directions of the magnetic field. It is shown that the local radiation of the magnetized neutron star atmospheres is highly anisotropic, with the maximum flux emitted in the magnetic field direction. At high B the <b>angular</b> <b>dependences</b> in the soft X-ray range have two maxima, a high narrow peak along B and a lower and broader maximum at intermediate angles. The radiation is strongly polarized, the modulation {{of the degree of}} polarization due to the rotation of the neurtron star may be much higher than that for the radiative flux.
