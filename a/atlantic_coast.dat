5|$|Before the 2004 college {{football}} season, the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Coast</b> Conference determined its champion via round-robin play {{during the course}} of the regular season and there was no conference championship game. In 2004, the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Coast</b> conference added two teams—Virginia Tech and Miami—expanding the league to 11 teams. At the time, {{college football}} teams were limited by the NCAA to 11regular-season games, three or four of which typically featured teams outside the home team's conference. Following the 2004season, the league added a 12th team—Boston College—and became eligible to hold a championship game at the conclusion of the 2005 season.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{captured}} Acadia from France in Queen Anne's War (1702–1713), but the Treaty of Utrecht left Cape Breton Island in French hands, and did {{not clearly}} demarcate a boundary between New France and the British colonies on the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>coast.</b> To protect the crucial passageway of the Saint Lawrence River {{into the heart of}} New France, France built a strong fortress at Louisbourg on the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>coast</b> of Cape Breton Island.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, the eight-team <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Coast</b> Conference added Florida State to the league, {{creating}} a new nine-team ACC. Though Florida State was the only school added to the conference, some league officials discussed offering one or more other schools—Navy, Pittsburgh, Syracuse, South Carolina, Miami, West Virginia, Boston College, Rutgers, or Virginia Tech—an offer to join the league. For various reasons, however, no other team was extended an offer. Throughout the 1990s, the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Coast</b> Conference remained at nine members. Ironically, South Carolina was a charter member of the ACC that left in 1971.|$|E

5|$|According to the Azores High hypothesis, an anti-phase {{pattern is}} {{expected}} to exist between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>coast.</b> During the quiescent periods, a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>coast.</b> During the hyperactive period, more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the Azores High was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean. Such a displacement of the Azores High is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in Haiti around 3200 14C years BP, and a change towards more humid conditions in the Great Plains during the late-Holocene as more moisture was pumped up the Mississippi Valley through the Gulf coast. Preliminary data from the northern <b>Atlantic</b> <b>coast</b> seem to support the Azores High hypothesis. A 3000-year proxy record from a coastal lake in Cape Cod suggests that hurricane activity increased significantly during the past 500–1000 years, just as the Gulf coast was amid a quiescent period of the last millennium.|$|E
