5|$|Montcalm, wary of a British counterattack, and {{concerned}} about the fatigue of his troops after <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> battle, had barrels of beer and wine brought forward to the lines. The troops spent the night alternating between sleeping and working on the defenses {{in anticipation of a}} renewed attack.|$|E
5|$|After <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> {{flying from}} their Half Moon Bay, California {{departure}} point, Jessica, her father, and her flight instructor arrived in Cheyenne {{the evening before}} their ill-fated flight. They were welcomed in Wyoming's capital city by Mayor Leo Pando. After some media interviews, they got a ride to their hotel in the car of a local radio station program director, who recalled them discussing the forecast weather conditions for the next day.|$|E
5|$|A {{vote was}} taken after <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> speeches, each colony casting a single vote, as always. The {{delegation}} for each colony numbered {{from two to}} seven members, and each delegation voted amongst themselves to determine the colony's vote. Pennsylvania and South Carolina voted against declaring independence. The New York delegation abstained, lacking permission to vote for independence. Delaware cast no vote because the delegation was split between Thomas McKean (who voted yes) and George Read (who voted no). The remaining nine delegations {{voted in favor of}} independence, which meant that the resolution had been approved by the committee of the whole. The next step was for the resolution to be voted upon by Congress itself. Edward Rutledge of South Carolina was opposed to Lee's resolution but desirous of unanimity, and he moved that the vote be postponed until the following day.|$|E

25|$|The Scots Greys, {{with the}} rest of the Union Brigade, missed the Battle of Quatre Bras despite <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> hard riding. As the French fell back, the Scots Greys and the rest of the Union Brigade arrived at the end of their 50-mile ride.|$|E
25|$|After <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> combat, the American fleet was {{in worse}} shape than the {{experienced}} British Navy. Upon ceasefire, Arnold called a council of war with his fellow officers, proposing to escape the British fleet via rowboats {{under the cover of}} night. As the British burned Arnold's flagship, the Royal Savage, to the east, the Americans rowed past the British lines.|$|E
25|$|Just after 01:00, 3 April, the Japanese {{commenced}} <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> aerial resistance. At 01:42, Prichett, having beaten off several attacks, {{was closed}} by two bogies. The first veered off, {{but the second}} pressed on and dropped a 500-pound bomb on the fantail. Exploding close under the counter, it holed the destroyer below the waterline, causing flooding aft and {{a fire in the}} 20 mm. clipping room. The crippled destroyer, maintaining a speed in excess of 28knots to minimize flooding and bringing the fire under control, remained in the area and continued to ward off enemy planes until relieved shortly before noon. She then retired to Kerama Retto for emergency repairs. On the 7th, she got underway for Guam where repairs were completed, and on 7 May she returned to Okinawa and radar picket duties. For almost 3 months she escaped further serious damage. However, on 29 July, while standing by a kamikaze victimshe became the target of a second suicide-minded Japanese pilot. Prichett took him under fire at 5,000 yards, but he bore on. Splashed into the sea approximately 6feet off the destroyer's port side, his mission was partially accomplished as his lethal cargo exploded on impact, bowing in the ship's hull and causing extensive damage to her superstructure, port depth charge racks, and radio and power leads. Prichett, despite her damage, remained in the area and for another two hours continued to pick up survivors from Callaghan.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} {{routes to}} the summit can be climbed in <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> out <b>of</b> Wild Basin. Most climbers ascent via Hourglass Ridge above Lion lakes or else via Boulder Grand Pass above Thunder Lake. Both are class 3 routes and do not require any technical moves.|$|R
60|$|There {{is nothing}} drearier than camping {{on the edge}} of civilization like this, where one is {{surrounded}} by ill smells, invaded by streams of foul dust, and deprived of wood and clear water. I was exceedingly eager to get away, especially as the wind continued cold and very searching. It was <b>a</b> <b>long</b> dull <b>day</b> <b>of</b> waiting.|$|R

500|$|I {{saw many}} signs in this campaign, {{some of them}} were not friendly; some were very friendly. But the one that touched me the most was one that I saw in Deshler, Ohio, at the end of <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> whistle-stopping. A little town. I suppose five times the {{population}} was there in the dusk. It was almost impossible to see, but a teenager held up a sign, [...] "Bring Us Together." [...] And that will be the great objective of this administration at the outset, to bring the American people together.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2009, while {{promoting}} their film Funny People Apatow and Rogen {{appeared on}} The Howard Stern Show and defended {{the work in}} Knocked Up, disagreeing with the position Heigl had stated. Rogen pointed to Heigl's work in the film The Ugly Truth to illustrate his point. Rogen said: [...] "I hear there's a scene where she's wearing underwear with a vibrator in it, so I'd have {{to see if that}} is uplifting for women." [...] Apatow attempted to discredit Heigl's criticisms, chalking up her harsh words to exhaustion at the end of <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> interviews and stating that he had expected an apology from Heigl. [...] "You would think at some point I'd get a call saying she was sorry, that she was tired, and then the call never comes." ...|$|E

5000|$|Lumberjack's breakfast, aka logger's breakfast, aka [...] "The Lumby" [...] — a gargantuan {{breakfast of}} three-plus eggs; rations of ham, bacon and sausages; and several large pancakes.

60|$|The {{sight of}} this Institution crowded with human derelicts {{struck me as}} most sad, more so indeed than many others that I have seen, though, perhaps, {{this may have been}} because I was myself tired out with <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> inspection.|$|E

60|$|Late on the {{following}} day the Nor'-West scouts reported the party of Indians, and soon a set of sleighs departed from the fort with loudly-ringing bells.

50|$|At {{a height}} of 714 m and a {{distance}} of about 3 mi from the Scottish border, it is best climbed from Langleeford in the Harthorpe Valley, over which it looms. A slightly gentler climb, though a longer distance, is from Linhope in the Breamish valley, approaching from the south east. An alternative route to the summit could involve <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day's</b> climb <b>of</b> both the Cheviot and Hedgehope Hill starting and finishing at Langleeford. It is a steep climb from any approach, best reserved for fitter walkers though the steepest inclines are not long in distance.|$|R

We should have stayed longer, but the ebbing away of our grub pile made us apprehensive. To return was impossible.|$|E

5000|$|Landings {{were another}} of the pair's biggest challenges. Approaching rocky shores that are being pounded by wind and surf is a {{hazardous}} business. Between timings and luck, you're a second away from disaster at any moment. Their landings were made even more difficult because of their [...] "sea-legs" [...] which they'd develop after <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>day's</b> paddle <b>of</b> 8 - 10 hours.

60|$|Captain Armand Jacot of the Foreign Legion sat upon an {{outspread}} saddle blanket at {{the foot}} of a stunted palm tree. His broad shoulders and his close-cropped head rested in luxurious ease against the rough bole of the palm.
