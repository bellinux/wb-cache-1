5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> {{continued}} to move northwestward, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 14W {{on the morning}} of September 10. Later that day, the tropical depression moved into the PAGASA Area of Responsibility, and was named Luis. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> {{continued to}} strengthen, the JMA upgraded the depression to a storm at 1200 UTC and named it Shanshan, a girls' given name submitted by Hong Kong. The HKO did the same at the same time, upgrading the depression to a storm.|$|E
5|$|Later on June14, the JTWC {{issued a}} Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the depression. Deep {{convection}} consolidated around {{the center of}} circulation and convective banding features developed along {{the periphery of the}} system. Several hours later, the TCFA was canceled <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> rapidly degenerated, with convection mostly dissipating and an exposed low. Outflow significantly deteriorated <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> detached itself from the TUTT. By this time, the JMA had ceased advisories on the depression. Two days later, after tracking across Luzon, the system began to regenerate. Convection redeveloped around the low and outflow was reestablished to the south.|$|E
5|$|The system {{began as}} a {{tropical}} wave that emerged off {{the west coast of}} Africa on September 21. The wave was not well-organized with only scattered thunderstorm activity and large area of low pressure. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> tracked westward south of Cape Verde, deep convection gradually increased, curved banding features became defined, and a poorly defined circulation became evident. Early on September 23, Dvorak classification estimates were introduced. Little change in organization took place until the evening of September 24. That evening, the low-level circulation and banding features became better defined <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> tracked west-northwest. Late that evening, the system was declared Tropical Depression Twelve while west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm warning was issued from Acapulco to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco at 2100UTC September 21, but was discontinued 18 hours later. On 0300 UTC September 12 a hurricane warning was issued for areas below La Paz. Twelve hours later, a {{tropical storm}} warning was issued for the remaining portion of Baja California Sur. The same day, a hurricane warning was issued for a large area of the mainland. However, all watches and warnings were discontinued on September 13 <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> had moved inland over Mexico.|$|E
5|$|A {{vigorous}} tropical wave {{exited the}} west coast of Africa on September 3. It quickly developed an area of deep convection with a well-defined circulation, which prompted it being classified a tropical depression on September4. At the time it was situated hundreds of miles south of Cape Verde at a very low latitude of 7.2°N. Initial intensification was slow <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> moved northwestward, a movement caused by a large mid-level trough over the central Atlantic. On September5 the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Isidore. Subsequently, it intensified at a faster rate, becoming a hurricane on September6. The following day, satellite estimates from the Dvorak technique suggested a peak intensity of 100mph (165km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 978 mbar (hPa; 28.88 inHg).|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> {{continued}} to move west on October 9, it strengthened into a hurricane, {{and while it}} began to curve toward the west-northwest, further strengthening occurred, as it intensified into a Category 2 hurricane. The hurricane made landfall in Nicaragua on October 10 as a Category 3 hurricane. The system quickly weakened to a tropical storm as it traveled west-northwestward on October 11, later passing over the Gulf of Honduras. It later struck Belize on October 13 as a strong Category 1 hurricane on October 13, tracking north-northwestward.|$|E

5|$|Despite a {{decrease}} in convection shortly after forming, the large depression remained well organized, with a wind field 575mi (930km) in diameter. On August 22, as it passed 140mi (225km) to south of the Cape Verde islands, deep convection developed over the center of circulation, and early on August 23 the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Debby about 300mi (485km) southwest of Cape Verde. Banding features continued to organize <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> slowly strengthened, and on August 23 Debby attained a peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) over the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters predicted Debby to continue to intensify to attain hurricane status, while its projected path placed the storm {{in an area of}} warm water temperatures and moderate upper level shear.|$|E
5|$|Despite its poor organization, Maria brought heavy {{rainfall}} to {{portions of the}} east Caribbean, notably Puerto Rico. Numerous roadways and homes were flooded, and as the storm passed through the extreme northeastern Caribbean, over 15,000 people went without power. In addition, tropical storm-force winds were observed {{on many of the}} U.S. Virgin Islands. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> passed west of Bermuda, brief tropical storm-force sustained winds were recorded, along with higher gusts; rainfall on the island, however, was minimal. In Newfoundland, strong winds were recorded, but rainfall totals were relatively minimal. There were no deaths reported in association with Maria, although the storm caused $1.3 million (2011 USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of September16, a reconnaissance plane recorded flight-level winds of 185km/h (115mph). Around this time, surface winds were estimated to be the same, making Helen a Category3 equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Later that day, the storm made landfall near Cape Kushimoto. In Shionomisaki Lighthouse, just west of where the center of Helen passed, a barometric pressure of 955mbar (hPa; 28.26inHg) was recorded, the lowest {{in relation to the}} storm. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> neared Hokkaido, it slowed down and began a multi-day anticyclonic loop. During this period, it merged with an upper-level low and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September19. The remnants of Helen then tracked across southern Hokkaido before dissipating just east of the island on September21.|$|E

5|$|During {{the morning}} of July 5, deep {{convection}} rapidly increased and banding features formed despite strong easterly wind shear. The convection persisted into the afternoon and the low was upgraded to Tropical Depression Five-E accordingly. Weak steering currents persisted as the depression moved towards the northwest at 4mph (6km/h) to 5mph (8km/h). Following the storm's upgrade, further development did not occur <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> tracked steadily towards the north-northwest. Early on July7, the depression made landfall near Lazaro Cardenas with winds of 35mph (55km/h). Rapid weakening followed shortly after landfall and the storm dissipated several hours later over the mountains of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Early on November 30, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> moved {{towards the}} east-southeast, TCWC Nadi issued a gale warning for the Cook Islands of Rarotonga and Mangaia, while issuing strong wind {{warnings}} and tropical cyclone alerts {{for the rest}} of the Southern Islands. The warnings were subsequently maintained until later that day, as Sina spared the Cook Islands its major effects and re-curved sharply towards the south-southeast. Only minor damage to shallow rooted crops and weak structures was reported, after high seas and gale force winds buffeted the northern side of Rarotonga.|$|E
5|$|Fay {{accelerated}} {{towards the}} Texas coast and made landfall early on September 7.

5|$|For the {{following}} ten days, Georges maintained a general west-northwest track {{for ten days}} due to a persistent mid to upper-level tropospheric ridge. Gradual intensification took place <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> developed strong outflow and warm sea surface temperatures aided in fueling further development. Easterly wind shear caused disruption of the storms' outflow; however, the center, previously surrounded by two deep areas of convection, was situated underneath one area of thunderstorm activity. By the late morning hours of September17, an eyewall developed within the circulation, indicating that Georges was nearing hurricane-status.|$|E

Rand advocated reason as {{the only means of}} acquiring knowledge, and rejected faith and religion. She supported rational and ethical egoism, and rejected altruism. In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral, and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism, and instead supported laissez-faire capitalism, which she defined <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> based on recognizing individual rights, including property rights. In art, Rand promoted romantic realism. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and classical liberals.|$|E

5|$|In early April 1996, a {{surge in}} the trade winds interacted with the monsoon trough to produce an area of convection. On 2April, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) first {{identified}} {{the system as a}} low to mid-level low pressure area over Indonesia north of Darwin, Australia. Despite strong wind shear, the system slowly became better organized as it moved southward, aided by improving upper-level outflow. Early on 5April, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified the system as Tropical Cyclone 25S <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> began a westward track, steered by a building mid-level ridge to the south. Shortly thereafter, the BoM upgraded the system to a Category1 cyclone, designating the storm as Tropical Cyclone Olivia.|$|E
