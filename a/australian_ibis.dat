40|$|Wild aquatic birds (WABs) are {{considered}} as reservoir hosts for Newcastle disease viruses (NDVs) and may act as vectors for transferring these viruses to poultry, causing outbreaks of disease. A 3 -year epidemiological {{study was conducted}} on WABs of north Queensland from April 2007 to March 2010. Swab and fresh moist faecal samples of WABs were screened to detect Newcastle disease viral (NDV) RNA by one-step real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in multiplex primers, targeting the matrix gene. The potential reactor samples in rRT-PCR were processed for sequencing of the different NDV genes using conventional PCR. The overall NDV RNA prevalence was 3. 5 % for live bird samples (N = 1461) and 0. 4 % for faecal samples (N = 1157). Plumed whistling ducks (PWDs) had a higher prevalence (4. 2 %) than Pacific black ducks (pBps) (0. 9 %) (χ² test, p = 0. 001). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the association between the proportion of reactor and non-reactor NDV RNA samples of PWDs and potential risk factors. The odds of reactor samples were 2. 7 (95 % Confidence Interval 1. 5 - 4. 9) times more likely in younger than older ducks (p = 0. 001) (data set B, multivariate analysis). Both NDV RNA class-one and class-two types were identified in samples of WABs (12 and 59, respectively) (Supplementary Table 1). Phylogenetic analysis of the matrix gene identified two reactor sequences of class-one type NDV RNA (PWD- 48 and 55) which were {{closely related to the}} sequences of <b>Australian</b> <b>Ibis</b> and duck isolates (Fig. 2). Another reactor sample sequence was determined as class-two type NDV RNA (PWD- 46, avirulent) based on analysis of the matrix and fusion genes which was more similar to the sequences of Australian 1 - 2 progenitor virus and vaccine strain virus (Figs. 3 and 4). Our findings of higher prevalence in PWDs along with confirmation of class-one and class-two type NDV RNAs will significantly contribute to the design of surveillance programs for NDVs in northern Australia...|$|E

40|$|The <b>Australian</b> White <b>Ibis</b> Threskiornis molucca is an {{unexpected}} {{addition to the}} small number of native birds that have recently moved into urban and suburban areas. The arrival of the species in the Central Business District of Brisbane in South East Queensland has been accompanied by an increase in associated human-wildlife conflicts. In order to provide essential ecological information of the species in this region, a series of studies have been undertaken. The present study attempts to determine the distribution of the <b>Australian</b> White <b>Ibis</b> with respect to six major habitat categories positioned along an 'urban gradient' from the urban centre, through suburban, exurban/rural and industrial areas, to wildland and coastal areas. Foraging ibis were surveyed during vehicle-based transects covering all parts of a 545 km 2 study area. All ibis detected were assigned to one of 218 1. 25 km 2 cells, which covered the entire study area. Ibis were detected throughout the area, though they occurred in highest numbers within urban and coastal areas. Ibis were found in 100 % of urban cells, 20 - 55 % of suburban, rural/exurban and industrial cells and were absent from all wildland cells.

40|$|Abstract: Over {{the last}} 20 years, <b>Australian</b> white <b>ibis</b> populations (Threskiornis molucca) have {{expanded}} into urban areas, leading to increased contact between ibis, domestic animals, and humans. This {{has led to}} concern that ibis may transmit pathogens that threaten public health or food production. Here we report results from a study of ibis viral serology and bacterial culture that indicate that ibis are hosts of zoonotic and livestock pathogens such as Salmonella spp., Newcastle disease virus, avian influenza virus, and flaviviruses in Australia. We also performed a behavioral study to measure contact rates among ibis, people, and livestock that determine the potential for disease transmission...|$|R
50|$|The {{islands of}} Rennell and Bellona are unique within the Solomon Islands, sharing {{similarities}} with New Caledonia and Australia {{as much as}} the Solomons. They are home to several endemic species, including the Rennell starling (Aplonis insularis) which is a species of starling in the family Sturnidae, the bare-eyed white-eye (Woodfordia superciliosa) which is a species of bird in the Zosteropidae family, the Rennell shrikebill (Clytorhynchus hamlini) which is a species of bird in the Monarchidae family, and the Rennell fantail (Rhipidura rennelliana) which is also a species of bird in the Rhipiduridae family. The Solomons white ibis (Threskiornis molucca pygmaeus) is a dwarf subspecies of the <b>Australian</b> white <b>ibis</b> that is endemic to Rennell and Bellona Islands.|$|R
50|$|The yellow-billed {{spoonbill}} nests once {{or twice}} a year, generally when water is plentiful. The breeding season varies: it is usually March to May after the wet season in the north of the country, and in winter-spring (August to October) in more temperate areas. The nest is a platform constructed of sticks; it has a hollowed centre, and can be located on the branches or fork of a tree, the base of which is often submerged in water. Reed beds are another nest location. The clutch consists of two to four dull white eggs measuring 68 x 45 mm. Nests are often located in colonies, with other species such as the royal spoonbill, <b>Australian</b> white <b>ibis,</b> straw-necked ibis, as well as herons, egrets or cormorants.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Australian</b> white <b>ibis</b> is {{widespread}} in eastern, northern and south-western Australia. It occurs in marshy wetlands, often near open grasslands {{and has become}} common in Australian east-coast city parks and rubbish dumps in the urban areas of Wollongong, Sydney, Perth, the Gold Coast, Brisbane and Townsville. Historically it was rare in urban areas; the first influx was noted after drought drove birds eastwards in the late 1970s. The urban population further increased after a further period of drought in 1998. [...] The first big colony {{set up in the}} Sydney suburb of Bankstown and started to cause anxiety in the local community.

50|$|With Astrebla Downs National Park, Diamantina National Park forms {{part of the}} 7627 km2 Diamantina and Astrebla Grasslands Important Bird Area, {{identified}} by BirdLife International as such because {{it is one of}} few sites known for the critically endangered night parrot. It also supports globally important populations of the plains-wanderer, <b>Australian</b> bustard, straw-necked <b>ibis,</b> white-necked heron, inland dotterel, Bourke's parrot, black and pied honeyeaters, gibberbird, Hall's babbler, chestnut-breasted quail-thrush, cinnamon quail-thrush and spinifexbird.|$|R
50|$|Few land {{birds are}} {{permanently}} resident, although many species visit and may breed. Large numbers of straw-necked ibis and, {{to a lesser}} extent, <b>Australian</b> white <b>ibis,</b> nest and roost on the islands and fly daily to the mainland for feeding. Lewin's rail occasionally breeds in the salt marsh but is so shy that nesting is seldom recorded. Up to 100 rare orange-bellied parrots have been seen on the islands during winter when they migrate to the Australian mainland from Tasmania. Since the mid-20th century, however, numbers have declined, possibly because {{the increasing number of}} gulls has changed the chemistry of the soil and so the vegetation on which the parrots feed. Nevertheless, the islands are an important habitat for this endangered species. Bronze whaler sharks are known to breed around the islands.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Australian</b> white <b>ibis</b> is {{a fairly}} large ibis species, around 65 - 75 cm long and has a bald black head and neck and a long black downcurved beak, {{measuring}} over 16.7 cm in the male, and under in the female. There is some sexual dimorphism in size, as the slightly heavier male weighs 1.7 - 2.5 kg compared to the 1.4 - 1.9 kg female. As a comparison, the American white ibis generally attains 1 kg in weight. The body plumage is white although it may become brown-stained. Inner secondary plumes are displayed as lacy black [...] "tail" [...] feathers. The upper tail becomes yellow when the bird is breeding. The legs and feet are dark and red skin is visible {{on the underside of}} the wing. Immature birds have shorter bills. The head and neck are feathered in juveniles.|$|R

50|$|It was {{initially}} described by Georges Cuvier in 1829 as Ibis molucca. It is {{considered part of}} a superspecies complex with the sacred ibis (T. aethiopicus) of Africa, and the black-headed ibis (T. melanocephalus) of Asia. Its status in the complex has vacillated over the years. Many older guidebooks referred to the bird as a species T. molucca, until {{a comprehensive review of}} plumage patterns by Holyoak in 1970. Holyoak noted the three species' similarities and that the Australian taxon resembled T. aethiopicus in adult plumage and T. melanocephalus in juvenile plumage. He proposed they all be considered part of a single species T. aethiopicus. This was generally accepted by the scientific community until Lowe and Richards's assessment of plumage in 1991. They again recommended the recognition of molucca at species level. This was followed by chromosome study which highlighted each of the three species having a different karyotype. The <b>Australian</b> white <b>ibis</b> has been considered a full species by most authorities since then.|$|R
40|$|Using {{a seven-year}} data set of visitation of an inner city park by the <b>Australian</b> white <b>ibis,</b> we {{investigated}} whether rain events {{were correlated with}} ibis abundance in the park. The park is associated {{with high levels of}} anthropogenic food, but relatively low levels of natural food sources. For all magnitudes of rainfall tested, ibis abundance significantly decreased after a rainfall event, although stronger responses were associated with higher rainfall, with a 46 % decline in ibis abundance following rainfall events of ¿ 60 mm. Average ibis abundance was higher during the dry, non-breeding period than during the breeding period, and variation associated with rainfall was particularly pronounced in the non-breeding period. However, the rainfall response was still evident in both periods. Results suggest that rainfall influences the ibis distribution in urban centres either by decreasing anthropogenic food supplied to the birds, forcing the birds to relocate to forage, or increasing the amount of natural food available elsewhere, or a combination of the two. Increased rainfall intensified the response by ibis, and our results demonstrate the importance of climatic processes on the behaviour of urban birds...|$|R
