30|$|After being {{quantified}} by the Bradford method [66], proteins {{from the}} FF and {{linked to the}} AgNPs were analyzed by LC-MS/MS according to a method based on denaturation followed by digestion using the trypsin enzyme (Sequencing Grade Modified Trypsin, Promega), desalting and concentration. The resulting solutions were centrifuged (10  min at 17, 000 ×g) and the supernatant was transferred into appropriate vials. Then, the samples were injected into the UPLC system, first passing through the precolumn (Waters Symmetry C 18, 20  mm[*]×[*] 180  μm, particles 5  μm), being desalted during 3  min with a flow of 5.0  μL min− 1 with 97 : 3 water/acetonitrile with 0.1  % formic acid (v/v) and, afterwards, they were transferred to the analytical column (Waters C 18 BEH 130, 100  mm ID[*]×[*] 100  μm, particles of 1.7  μm). Finally, the samples were eluted with a flow rate of 1.0  μL min− 1 by varying the gradient of mobile phases with a gradient of buffer A (water/formic acid 0.1  %, v/v) and B (acetonitrile/formic acid 0.1  %, v/v) at the rates of 97 : 3, 70 : 30, 20 : 80, 20 : 80, 97 : 3, and 97 : 3 at 0, 40, 50, 55, 56, and 60  min, respectively. The identification of the peptides was done using the online version of the Waters software with a mass spectrometer (Synapt HDMS-Waters) configured to operate in dependent acquisition data (<b>ADD)</b> <b>mode</b> containing a function MS full-scan (m/z 200 – 2000), a three function fragment ion spectrum (MS/MS, m/z 50 to 50 units over the m/z of the precursor) and a function of external standard calibration (lock-mass, m/z 200 – 2000). All spectra were acquired {{at a rate of}} 1  Hz. The other parameters were capillary voltage of 3.0  kV, cone voltage of 30  V, source temperature of 100  °C Gas Flow nanoESI 0.5  L h− 1, collision energies of 6 : 04  eV and a 1700 -V detector. The acquisition of raw data was performed with ProteinLynx Global Server v. 2.2 software (Waters). Data treatments for the deconvolutions of raw spectra were performed with Transform software (Micromass, UK). MASCOT v. 2.2 system (Matrix Science Ltd.

40|$|The reduced-order {{modeling}} of integrally bladed disks (blisks) for predicting the mis-tuned vibration {{response has been}} well studied and understood. For solving a direct vibra-tion problem, <b>adding</b> <b>modes</b> to the modeling basis improves {{the accuracy of the}} reduced-order model (ROM) with respect to the parent finite element model. In contrast, when solving an inverse problem for system identification, <b>adding</b> <b>modes</b> to the ROM while us-ing the same measurements may actually reduce its accuracy. This is especially true for solving inverse problems related to identification of blade mistuning parameters, because the characteristics of the selected system modes for the ROM may not match well the assumptions used in the mistuning modeling approach. In this work, a procedure is intro-duced for constructing a ROM referred to as the inverse ROM (IROM) that is well suited for solving the mistuning identification inverse problem. First, a quantitative metric is defined to characterize and rank the tuned system modes with respect to their suitability for constructing IROMs. Then, the direct problem is solved using a larger direct ROM (or DROM) with prescribed mistuning in order to interrogate and validate the performance of various IROMs as <b>modes</b> are <b>added.</b> This enables the automated construction of suitable IROMs and improves the overall accuracy and robustness of mistuning identification.

When dissolving rate is low while cleaning effect requirement is high, the traditional mode cannot achieve the target properly.
