5|$|The RAAF and Army jointly {{decided to}} {{withdraw}} the Chinooks from service in May 1989. This {{decision was made to}} reduce costs, the Army believing that the Black Hawks would provide sufficient <b>air</b> <b>lift</b> capability. Due to the Chinooks' high operating costs, only six of the helicopters were in service at the time. No. 12 Squadron ceased flying on 30 June 1989, and was disbanded on 25 August that year.|$|E
5|$|In February 1987, Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons joined No.33 Squadron (flying Boeing 707 tanker-transports) {{as part of}} a re-formed No.86 Wing {{under the}} newly {{established}} <b>Air</b> <b>Lift</b> Group (renamed Air Mobility Group in April 2014). In May that year four C-130s flew a rifle company of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, from Townsville to Norfolk Island during Operation Morris Dance, the Australian Defence Force's response to the first of the 1987 Fijian coups; the soldiers subsequently embarked onto RAN warships by helicopter. In 1988, No.37 Squadron's Hercules achieved 200,000accident-free flying hours. No.36 Squadron achieved 100,000accident-free flying hours on the C-130H in 1990. Members of the travelling public experienced flying by Hercules in 1989, when the Australian Government employed the C-130s and 707s for transport during the pilots' dispute that curtailed operations by the two domestic airlines; the resulting spike in operational hours necessitated No.486 Squadron sending detachments to several locations throughout the country to cope with increased maintenance demands. By the late 1980s, some C-130 maintenance tasks had been outsourced to commercial firms, and Air New Zealand won a four-year depot maintenance contract in 1990.|$|E
5|$|No. 38 Squadron {{relocated}} to RAAF Station Schofields near Sydney on 15 August 1946. It {{became part of}} No. 86 Wing, along with Nos. 36 and 37 Squadrons, which also operated Dakotas, and No. 486 (Maintenance) Squadron, which serviced the wing's flying units. Commencing on 22 January 1947, one of No. 38 Squadron's main responsibilities was to conduct thrice-weekly courier flights to Japan to support the Australian element of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. These flights were the longest regular air route serviced by twin-engined aircraft at the time, and took several days to complete. The courier flights continued until 13 January 1948, after which chartered Qantas aircraft were used to support the force in Japan. In August 1948, five of No. 38 Squadron's air crews were dispatched to Europe where, {{as members of the}} RAAF Squadron Berlin <b>Air</b> <b>Lift,</b> they participated in the international efforts to fly supplies into Berlin during the Soviet blockade of the city. These personnel remained in Europe for 12 months, and their absence greatly disrupted No. 38 Squadron's operations. Overall, twenty members of No. 86 Wing were sent to Europe; the resulting shortage of personnel forced Nos. 36 and 38 Squadrons to operate for a period as a single unit, all flying hours being attributed to No. 38 Squadron in official records. No. 86 Wing moved to Richmond between 22 June and 1 July 1949.|$|E

5|$|In January–February 1979, two No.37 Squadron C-130Es {{evacuated}} Australian {{and other}} foreign embassy staff from Tehran, shortly before the collapse of royal rule during the Iranian Revolution. The same year, the squadron began operations with two ex-Qantas Boeing 707s, handing them over to No.33 Flight (later No.33 Squadron) {{at the beginning of}} 1981. No.37 Squadron transported the Popemobiles on John Paul II's 1986 tour of Australia; its other unusual cargoes have included a stud bull presented to the Chinese government, kangaroos and sheep to Malaysia, and an exhibition of China's Entombed Warriors. In February 1987, the unit again joined No.36 Squadron, along with No.33 Squadron, as part of a re-formed No.86 Wing under the newly established <b>Air</b> <b>Lift</b> Group (later Air Mobility Group). The following year, No.37 Squadron achieved 200,000 accident-free flying hours on the Hercules. The Australian public had the experience of flying in the C-130s when the aircraft were employed by the Federal government to provide transport during the 1989 Australian pilots' dispute that curtailed operations by the two domestic airlines. In December 1990 and January 1991, a detachment of C-130s from Nos.36 and 37Squadrons flew missions to Dubai in support of Australia's naval contribution to the Gulf War. No.37 Squadron transported Australian troops to Somalia as part of Operation Solace in January 1993, and provided a shuttle service between Kenya and Somalia during May. No.486 Squadron was disbanded in October 1998, having transferred its C-130 maintenance functions to Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons. No.37 Squadron began re-equipping with new-model C-130J Hercules in September 1999. Its aircraft formed part of a detachment of C-130s supporting INTERFET forces in East Timor between September 1999 and February 2000, under Operation Warden. The squadron was awarded the Gloucester Cup in 2001, the same year it took delivery of its twelfth and final C-130J. Five C-130s of Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons participated in relief efforts following the Bali bombings in October 2002.|$|E

25|$|In the winter, Richthofen {{was forced}} to {{reshuffle}} his units around to meet threats and offer support. By 7 November, he had helped the German Sixth Army eliminate {{nearly all of the}} Soviet forces in Stalingrad. But the effort created a supply crisis. The Luftwaffes railheads were 100 kilometres west of Stalingrad, and regardless of the army's difficulties, his units got logistical priority. Richthofen recommended this be amended. The battle in Stalingrad had meant, in Richthofen's view, that air units could not be effective in close-quarter combat. Until this point, Richthofen had received 42,630 tons of supplies and 20,713 tons of fuel while the army received 9,492 tons of fuel. He rationed his own fuel stocks which allowed him to create a reserve but also increased, by <b>air</b> <b>lift,</b> the tonnage from 2,000 to 5,000 tons.|$|E

25|$|On 19 November the Red Army began {{a counter}} offensive, named Operation Uranus. Within days, the Soviets had encircled some 300,000 German, Italian, Romanian and Hungarian {{soldiers}} {{in the city of}} Stalingrad. It was decided by Hitler and the OKL to supply the Axis forces by air. Richthofen was horrified. He telephoned Berchtesgaden and tried to get through to Hitler, but none of his aides would put him through. He tried to convince Göring that his air fleet did not have the resources to sustain an <b>air</b> <b>lift,</b> and that the best option would be to attempt a breakout before the Soviet forces entrenched. He flew to Manstein's headquarters, and the Field Marshal agreed a breakout must take place. With the Sixth Army preserved, the initiative could be regained later. He made this request to Hitler. The Soviet divisions were smaller than their German counterparts: but they had 97. Holding Stalingrad was now impossible.|$|E
25|$|After the defeat, Richthofen {{travelled}} to see Hitler on 11 February. He {{first met}} with Göring, who {{was worried that}} Richthofen would use the opportunity to criticise his leadership. In the event he did not, but Richthofen did criticise Göring's reluctance to disagree with Hitler and attacked his willingness {{to allow him to}} receive what he considered to be faulty advice. When Richthofen did meet Hitler he criticised him openly for micromanagement, though he did insist he had been let down by his advisors. Hitler took all of this calmly, and admitted (as he had done to Erhard Milch) that he bore the ultimate responsibility for the <b>air</b> <b>lift</b> fiasco. Richthofen argued commanders needed more tactical and operational freedom, as had Manstein. Hitler agreed. Richthofen was probably helped, regardless of his criticism, by the fact that Hitler genuinely liked him, and believed him to be loyal. Four days later Richthofen was promoted to the rank of field marshall being the youngest officer beside Göring to reach this rank in the Wehrmacht.|$|E
25|$|Headquarters RAAF Base Richmond {{was formed}} in April 1952 to replace the former Station Headquarters, along with a {{subordinate}} unit, Base Squadron Richmond, for the day-to-day running of the establishment. The base was evacuated in February 1956 due {{to the threat of}} rising floodwaters nearby, the only time in its history that flooding in the Hawkesbury region became serious enough to warrant such action. In 1958–59, No.36 Squadron began operating its first C-130 Hercules heavy transports, which were augmented by No.38 Squadron's DHC-4 Caribou tactical transports in 1964. No.86 Wing was disbanded in August that year, but reformed in February 1987, under the newly established Headquarters <b>Air</b> <b>Lift</b> Group that replaced the former Base Headquarters. At the same time, Base Squadron was reformed as Base Support Wing. No.86 Wing took control of No.33 Squadron, operating Boeing 707 jet tanker/transports, as well as Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons, flying Hercules. No.486 Maintenance Squadron and Air Movements Training and Development Unit (AMTDU) were also under its aegis at Richmond. The Hercules, Caribous and 707s became synonymous with disaster relief and emergency transport in Australia and the region, as well as deploying on overseas peacekeeping missions. Richmond was the venue for many air shows including, in 1988, the largest staged in Australia to that date, celebrating the Australian Bicentenary. The base also staged the RAAF's 70th Anniversary Air show in 1991, the same year that the Hercules achieved 500,000 accident-free hours of operation.|$|E

500|$|In May 2006, No.36 Squadron {{personnel}} began {{conversion training}} in the US in preparation for re-equipping with Boeing C-17 GlobemasterIII heavy transports. It transferred its C-130Hs to No.37 Squadron on 17November 2006, prior to relocating to Amberley. Also on 17November, Wing Commander Linda Corbould took command of the unit, becoming {{the first woman to}} lead an RAAF flying squadron. Corbould was responsible for delivering the first Globemaster from the United States to Australia on 4December. No.36 Squadron achieved initial operating capability with the C-17 on 11September 2007, following eight months' work-up training. In June 2008, it received the Gloucester Cup as the RAAF's most proficient flying squadron of 2007 [...] "for achieving all training objectives, supporting <b>air</b> <b>lift</b> activities globally and nationally and fulfilling short-notice, high priority tasks, despite the squadron's expertise being in its infancy". Corbould completed her posting as commanding officer on 8December 2008, the day the squadron marked the second anniversary of C-17 operations by conducting the RAAF's first flight with an all-female aircrew.|$|E
500|$|No.486 Squadron {{celebrated its}} 40th Anniversary on 26August 1986. No.86 Wing re-formed at Richmond on 2February 1987, under the newly {{established}} <b>Air</b> <b>Lift</b> Group (ALG). As well as No.486 Squadron, the wing controlled No.33 Squadron flying Boeing 707 transports, Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons flying C-130H and C-130E Hercules respectively, and Air Movements Training and Development Unit. No.486 Squadron was responsible for operational and intermediate-level maintenance of the 707s {{as well as the}} Hercules. It also managed flight simulators and all ground-based equipment. The C-130Es operated by No.37 Squadron achieved 200,000accident-free flying hours in 1988. Two years later, No.36 Squadron achieved 100,000accident-free flying hours on the C-130H. [...] Some C-130 maintenance tasks were outsourced to commercial firms beginning in the late 1980s, and Air New Zealand won a four-year depot maintenance contract in 1990. Following conversion of four of No.33 Squadron's six aircraft to aerial tankers between 1988 and 1992, No.486 Squadron took on responsibility for servicing the 707s' refuelling pods.|$|E
500|$|On 1July 1983, {{after the}} {{government}} procured two more 707s for $7.5 million from Worldways Canada, No.33 Flight was reorganised as No.33 Squadron under Grierson's command. Responsible for transporting VIPs such {{as members of the}} British Royal Family, the Governor-General, the Prime Minister, and the Pope, the 707 also became the first RAAF aircraft to land in the Soviet Union, the occasion being the funeral of Konstantin Chernenko in 1985. Along with Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons, operating Lockheed C-130 Hercules, No.33 Squadron came under the control of No.86 Wing, part of the newly established <b>Air</b> <b>Lift</b> Group (later Air Mobility Group), in February 1987. Routine servicing of the 707s and Hercules was the responsibility of No.486 Squadron, another component of No.86 Wing. Qantas undertook heavier maintenance of the 707s at its jet base in Mascot. The RAAF acquired three more 707s on 25February 1988, following a $25 million purchase from Boeing Military. One of the airframes was non-flying, for spares only, and was nicknamed [...] "Hulksbury".|$|E

When No.86 Wing was re-formed at Richmond on 2February 1987, under the newly established <b>Air</b> <b>Lift</b> Group (later Air Mobility Group), No.36 Squadron formed part of its complement. The unit again received the Gloucester Cup in 1989. That year, it [...] provided transport for civilian passengers during the pilots' dispute that curtailed operations by the two domestic airlines; three aircraft and five crews undertook this task, over and above their normal duties. The squadron reached 100,000 accident-free flying hours on the C-130H during 1990. In December 1990 and January 1991, it flew missions to Dubai in support of Australia's naval contribution to the Gulf War, and in 1993 transported Australian troops to Somalia as part of Operation Solace. Four of its C-130Hs were equipped with Electronic Warfare Self Protection packs, including radar and missile warning systems, and countermeasures such as chaff and flares, in 1994. Later in the decade, one of the C-130Hs was fitted with signals intelligence equipment and crewed by RAAF and Defence Signals Directorate personnel.|$|E

The U.S. IX Troop Carrier Command were limited in their availability; with two more major drops taking place at the same time, there were insufficient carrier aircraft available to fly the entire division to the Netherlands in one lift. Additionally, Major General Williams—commander of IX Troop Carrier Command—decided that it would only be possible for one <b>air</b> <b>lift</b> per day, meaning it would take three days to deliver the entire Division and Polish Brigade to the area. A limited number of areas suitable for glider landings and a reluctance from troop command to fly too near to Arnhem, exposing them to flak from Deelen airfield after the drop, meant that Urquhart was forced to pick drop zones (DZ) and landing zones (LZ) up to [...] from Arnhem itself, {{on the north side of}} the river.

No.37 Squadron was strengthened to create a [...] "super squadron" [...] on 17November 2006, when its force of twelve C-130Js was augmented by No.36 Squadron's twelve C-130Hs, prior to the latter re-equipping with Boeing C-17 Globemasters and relocating to RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland. Two of the C-130s joined DHC-4 Caribous from No.38 Squadron {{as part of the}} RAAF's initial contribution to Operation Papua New Guinea Assist following Cyclone Guba in November 2007. No.37 Squadron took over full responsibility for the Hercules detachment to the MEAO in mid-2008, and in March 2010 one of its C-130Js completed the detachment's 20,000th hour of flying operations. The squadron was transferred from No.86 Wing to No.84 Wing on 1October 2010, as part of a restructure of <b>Air</b> <b>Lift</b> Group.

500|$|No. 84 Wing was re-established as a {{tactical}} transport wing under {{the newly formed}} Operational Support Group (OSG) at RAAF Base Townsville, Queensland, in February 1991. It comprised two squadrons of de Havilland DHC-4 Caribous: No.35 Squadron, located at Townsville, and No.38 Squadron, located at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales. Prior to this, the two squadrons had been {{under the control of}} Tactical Transport Group, OSG's predecessor at Townsville. No.84 Wing's primary purpose was to support Australian Army operations and exercises, as well as the Parachute Training School at HMAS Albatross in Nowra, New South Wales. It also maintained detachments for search-and-rescue and local transport duties at RAAF Base Darwin, Northern Territory, and RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia. The Pearce detachment (No.38 Squadron DetachmentA) was formed from No.2 Flying Training School's Caribou Flight on 1March 1991. In addition to their military role, the Caribous provided assistance to the civil community in the form of disaster relief and medical evacuation. The aircraft frequently operated in Papua New Guinea, for training and humanitarian missions. [...] No.38 Squadron, responsible for all Caribou aircrew conversion and operations training, transferred to RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, in October 1992. Beginning the following month, seven of the fleet's twenty-one Caribous were retired to storage at Amberley for use as spare parts. By mid-1996, No.84 Wing was under the control of <b>Air</b> <b>Lift</b> Group (ALG), located at Richmond, and had been augmented by No.32 Squadron, operating Hawker Siddeley HS748s for navigational training, VIP transport, and fisheries surveillance out of RAAF Base East Sale in Victoria.|$|E
500|$|In 1984, No.34 Squadron {{was awarded}} the Gloucester Cup for its proficiency. It again became part of No.86 Wing in June 1988, though its tasking {{continued}} {{to be controlled by}} the Governor-General, the Prime Minister, and the Minister for Defence. Commencing in September 1989, the twinjet Mysteres and BAC 1-11s were replaced by five trijet Dassault Falcon 900s leased from Hawker Pacific, the first time the RAAF had leased aircraft from a commercial company. The two HS748s were transferred to the newly formed No.32 Squadron at RAAF Base East Sale, Victoria. Responsibility for servicing the Falcon 900s was shared by No.34 Squadron and Hawker Pacific, the latter performing heavy maintenance. In an unusual operation for the squadron, one of the Falcons was dispatched to Jordan in September 1990 to evacuate thirteen Australian citizens who had been held hostage in Iraq. On 21December 1992, a Falcon900 became the first RAAF aircraft to take part in United Nations peacekeeping efforts in Somalia, when it departed RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, with a team of Australian Army personnel to reconnoitre the theatre of operations. The squadron received a commendation from the Chief of the Defence Force, General Peter Gration, shortly before his retirement in 1993. In January 1998, No.84 Wing was organised as a special transport wing under <b>Air</b> <b>Lift</b> Group (renamed Air Mobility Group in April 2014). The term [...] "special transport" [...] referred to activities not directly related to army support, such as carrying VIPs. Headquartered at Richmond, No.84 Wing took control of Nos.32, 33 and 34Squadrons.
