Obtaining accurate average-value models of individual subsystems {{that can be used for}} extracting the input/output impedance as well as for increasing the simulation speed of the respective models.

It was decided to study the behavior of a PEBB-based integrated shipboard power system during reconfiguration. Since no real time operation data was available, the problem was studied through the simulation of reconfiguration scenarios on a scaled-down computer model of an IPS in MATLAB. Reconfiguration scenarios were determined and staged, and an AC/DC power system stability assessment methodology was applied by decoupling the IPS test system around an intrazonal bus. The coupled system of the test IPS, consisted of two dynamic 4160 VAC generators, two rectifiers, two DC-DC converters between the rectifiers' output looped bus and the downstream intrazonal 775 V busses, inverters, buck converters, AC loads and DC loads. There was modeling of excitation perturbations which introduced errors in the assessment of the stability requiring an approximation analysis. The study found that the DC bus of interest was stable for all nine reconfiguration scenarios staged, but it found that other busses were not stable for two of the scenarios.

40|$|The {{electron}} transport in a 1 D conductor with {{an isolated}} local defect {{such as an}} impurity or a non-adiabatic contact is studied theoretically. New regime of conduction in correlated 1 D systems is predicted beyond the well-known regime of tunneling resulting in the power-law I-V-curves. In this regime a quantum wire becomes "opened" at voltage biases above the threshold value V_T, giving rise to a rapid increase of the dc current, I̅, accompanied by ac oscillations of frequency f = I̅/e. The effect of <b>ac</b> <b>generation</b> is related to sliding of the Friedel oscillations of electronic density produced by the defect. Manifestations of the effect resemble the Coulomb blockade and the Josephson effect. The spin bias applied to the system is shown to affect the I-V curves due to violation of the spin-charge separation at the defect site. In short quantum wires of length L T_ 0 ∼ eV_T/k_B the effect is destroyed by fluctuations. The threshold voltage V_T is determined by 2 k_F-component of impurity potential renormalized by fluctuations. The 1 D conductor is {{described in terms of}} the Tomonaga-Luttinger Hamiltonian with short range or long-range Coulomb interaction by means of the bosonization technique. We derive boundary conditions that take into account relaxation in the leads and permit to solve non-equilibrium problems.
