5|$|Beddard (1858–1925) was an English {{zoologist}} {{specializing in}} Annelid worms, but writing much more widely on topics including mammals and zoogeography. He also contributed articles on earthworms, leeches and nematode worms to the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica. His decision {{to write an}} accessible book on animal coloration falls into this pattern. Beddard wrote Animal Coloration {{at a time when}} scientists' confidence in Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection was at a low ebb. Beddard's book was part of an ongoing debate among zoologists <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>far</b> natural selection affected animals, and how far other forces – such as the direct action of light – might be the causes of observed features such as the colours of animals. Edward Bagnall Poulton's far more strongly pro-Darwinian book The Colours of Animals had appeared just two years earlier in 1890.|$|E

25|$|How far these snakes {{can strike}} has been controversial. Obviously this {{depends on the}} size of the animal, but other factors may also play a role, such as the species, the {{position}} of the body, and the degree of excitement. Additionally, the question of definition exists: from which point on the snake should a strike be measured: from the front, the middle, or the back of the anchor coil on the ground? Even if the length of the specimen is known, once it strikes, it is almost impossible to determine the limiting point reached by its head and the position of its body when the movement started. Therefore, it is not surprising that many conflicting statements can be found in the available literature <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>far</b> these snakes can strike. Estimates have been given that range from one-third of the body length, to half, three-quarters or even the full length of the animal. They rarely strike further than half of their body length, and almost never more than three-fourths, but that it is still not wise to trust such values if only because it is not possible to accurately judge the length of a coiled snake.|$|E

An interdisciplinary, international team set in to find out: 1) What are the students unhappy about?

500|$|Mackintosh's view having prevailed, on 24 January 1915 {{the first}} of three parties set out for the Barrier journey, the others {{following}} on the next day. [...] Further dissension soon arose between Joyce and Mackintosh <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>far</b> south the dogs should be taken. Joyce wanted them to go no further than the Bluff, but Mackintosh's sense of urgency meant that they were taken on to 80°S. [...] A further setback was the failure of the attempts to move stores by motor tractor. [...] Although, ultimately, the depots were laid at Minna Bluff and at 80°S, the overall operation was beset by problems. [...] Not all the stores had reached the depots, and, as well as the motor tractor failure, all ten dogs taken on the journey perished during the return. By the time that all parties were reunited at Hut Point (Scott's old Discovery base {{at the edge of the}} Barrier) on 25 March, the men themselves were exhausted and frostbitten, and there was a significant loss of confidence in Mackintosh.

500|$|This {{scene is}} {{remarkable}} {{not only for}} its vividness but {{as one of the few}} parts of the Book of the Dead with any explicit moral content. The judgment of the dead and the Negative Confession were a representation of the conventional moral code which governed Egyptian society. For every [...] "I have not..." [...] in the Negative Confession, it is possible to read an unexpressed [...] "Thou shalt not". While the Ten Commandments of Judeo-Christian ethics are rules of conduct laid down by a perceived divine revelation, the Negative Confession is more a divine enforcement of everyday morality. [...] Views differ among Egyptologists <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>far</b> the Negative Confession represents a moral absolute, with ethical purity being necessary for progress to the Afterlife. John Taylor points out the wording of Spells 30B and 125 suggests a pragmatic approach to morality; by preventing the heart from contradicting him with any inconvenient truths, it seems that the deceased could enter the afterlife even if their life had not been entirely pure. Ogden Goelet says [...] "without an exemplary and moral existence, there was no hope for a successful afterlife", while Geraldine Pinch suggests that the Negative Confession is essentially similar to the spells protecting from demons, and that the success of the Weighing of the Heart depended on the mystical knowledge of the true names of the judges rather than on the deceased's moral behaviour.|$|E

40|$|The Emerging Church Movement (ECM) is a {{primarily}} Western religious phenomenon, identifiable by its critical ‘deconstruction’ of ‘modern’ religion. While {{most prominent}} in North America, especially the United States, {{some of the}} most significant contributors to the ECM ‘conversation’ have been the Belfast-based Ikon Collective and one of its founders, philosopher Peter Rollins. Their rootedness in the unique religious, political and social landscape of Northern Ireland in part explains their position on the ‘margins’ of the ECM, and provides many of the resources for their contributions. Ikon’s development of ‘transformance art’ and its ‘leaderless’ structure raise questions about the institutional viability of the wider ECM. Rollins’ ‘Pyrotheology’ project, grounded in his reading of post-modern philosophy, introduces more radical ideas to the ECM conversation.
