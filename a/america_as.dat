5|$|In {{cases of}} massive and severe {{infection}} of invasive pests, techniques of pest control {{are often used}} in combination. An example is the emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis, an invasive beetle from China, which has destroyed {{tens of millions of}} ash trees in its introduced range in North <b>America.</b> <b>As</b> part of the campaign against it, from 2003 American scientists and the Chinese Academy of Forestry searched for its natural enemies in the wild, leading to the discovery of several parasitoid wasps, namely Tetrastichus planipennisi, a gregarious larval endoparasitoid, Oobius agrili, a solitary, parthenogenic egg parasitoid, and Spathius agrili, a gregarious larval ectoparasitoid. These have been introduced and released into the United States of <b>America</b> <b>as</b> a possible biological control of the emerald ash borer. Initial results for Tetrastichus planipennisi have shown promise, and it is now being released along with Beauveria bassiana, a fungal pathogen with known insecticidal properties.|$|E
