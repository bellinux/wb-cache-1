2500|$|Summers's protégée Sheryl Sandberg has defended {{him saying}} that [...] "Larry {{has been a}} true {{advocate}} for women throughout his career" [...] at the World Bank and Treasury. Sandberg described of the lunch talk [...] "What few seem to note {{is that it is}} remarkable that he was giving the speech in the first place – that he cared enough about women's careers and their trajectory in the fields of math and science to proactively analyze the issues <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> was going wrong".|$|E
2500|$|On the November 20, 2008 {{episode of}} Impact!, Kurt Angle {{threatened}} Mick Foley and wanted another match against Jarrett at Final Resolution after Foley {{announced that it}} was Angle vs. Rhino at the event. Angle continued to demand a match with Jarrett and he said if he couldn't get him at Final Resolution, he would wrestle Foley. Angle then slapped Foley causing Jarrett to come out <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> Angle wanted and then what Jarrett wanted (Angle to be fired). Because of Angle's contract clause, Jarrett could not fire him, so he made this stipulation: if Angle lost to Rhino, he would be fired from TNA; if Angle beat Rhino, he would get Jarrett at Genesis. Angle won, allowing him to face Jarrett at Genesis. The feud got even more personal when it started involving Jarrett's three daughters during the December 11, 2008 episode of Impact. Angle said that they would become orphans after Genesis and that [...] "Uncle Kurt" [...] may find it in his heart to adopt them and make them his. Jarrett came out to confront him but was held back by his longtime friend, BG James, TNA Personnel Terry Taylor, referee Earl Hebner, and Scott D'Amore. On January 11 at Genesis, Jarrett lost to Angle. Jarrett suffered some injuries, but able to compete on the TNA Maximum Impact Tour, by facing against Angle in two singles and a few tag team matches with A.J. Styles against Angle and Scott Steiner. Then on February 12, 2009, Jarrett returned to Impact! to stop Angle from forcing Sting to lay down and gain an easy championship victory. The next week, Jarrett allowed Angle to have another match against Sting, and on February 26, 2009 Jarrett announced Angle vs. Sting at Destination X for the TNA World Championship.|$|E
6000|$|March {{observed}} {{with a degree}} of mortification that the talk was very little of it in the New York press; there the references to the novel enterprise were slight and cold. But Fulkerson said: [...] "Don't mind that, old man. It's the whole country that makes or breaks a thing like this; New York has {{very little to do with}} it. Now if it were a play, it would be different. New York does make or break a play; but it doesn't make or break a book; it doesn't make or break a magazine. The great mass of the readers are outside of New York, and the rural districts are what we have got to go for. They don't read much in New York; they write, <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> they've written. Don't you worry." ...|$|E

60|$|And now I {{come to a}} bit of {{my story}} that clean takes my breath away as I think of it, and makes me wish that I had never taken the job of telling it in hand. For when I write I like things to come slow and orderly and in their turn, like sheep {{coming out of a}} paddock. So it was at West Inch. But now that we were drawn into a larger life, like wee bits of straw that float slowly down some lazy ditch, until they {{suddenly}} find themselves in the dash and swirl of a great river; then it is very hard for me with my simple words to keep pace with it all.

5000|$|I {{think the}} notion of {{traditional}} anchor is fading away, the all-knowing, all-seeing person who speaks from on high. I don't think the audience really buys that anymore. As a viewer, I know I don't buy it. I {{think you have to}} be yourself, and you have to be real and you have to admit what you don't know, <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> you do know, <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> you don't know as long as you say you don't know it. I tend to relate more to people on television who are just themselves, for good or for bad, than I do to someone who I believe is putting on some sort of persona. The anchorman on The Simpsons is a reasonable facsimile of some anchors who have that problem.|$|E

Around 20,000 workers were interviewed over a period of two years. The interviews enabled the researchers to discover a rich and intriguing world that previously remained undiscovered and unexamined within the Hawthorne studies undertaken so far. The discovery of the informal organisation and its relationship to the formal organization was the landmark of experiments in interviewing workers. These experiment led to a richer understanding of the social, interpersonal dynamics of people at work.|$|R
