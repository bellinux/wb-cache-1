5|$|On {{the third}} day of the battle the Persian fleet was ready to attack the Allied lines in full force. Seeing the Persian fleet assemble, the Allies {{attempted}} to block the Straits of Artemisium <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> and waited for the Persians to attack. The Persians formed their ships into a semicircle and tried to enclose the Allied fleet, upon which the Allies rowed forward and joined battle. The battle raged all day long, with the Allies hard put to defend their line. When the fleets finally disengaged at nightfall, both sides had suffered roughly equal losses. However, the smaller Allied fleet could scarcely afford such losses; half the Athenian ships (the largest contingent in the fleet) were damaged or lost.|$|E
5|$|Public {{reaction}} to the Emperor's speech varied–many Japanese simply listened to it, then went {{on with their lives}} <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> while some Army and Navy officers chose suicide over surrender. At a base north of Nagasaki, some Japanese Army officers, enraged at the prospect of surrender, pulled some 16 captured American airmen out of the base prison and hacked them to death with swords. A large, weeping crowd gathered in front of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo, with their cries sometimes interrupted by the sound of gunshots as military officers present committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|At 4:00 am on 25 August, {{the newly}} erected French gun battery {{opened fire on}} Sirius and Iphigenia, which {{returned}} fire <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> Accepting that Sirius was beyond repair, Pym removed all her personnel and military supplies, setting fire to the frigate at 9:00 am, shortly after Iphigenia had pulled beyond {{the range of the}} battery, using a cannon as an anchor after losing hers the previous day. French boats attempted to reach Sirius and capture her before she exploded, although they turned back when Pym launched his own boats to contest possession of the wreck. The frigate's remaining munitions exploded at 11:00 am. During the morning, Duperré sent an official boarding party aboard Nereide, who wet the decks to prevent any risk of fire from the ships burning in the harbour and removed 75 corpses from the frigate.|$|E

50|$|In the {{afternoon}} of May 5, the Prague mayor formally switched allegiance to the National Committee in the City Hall. The Czechs in the streets tore down the German road traffic signs and store inscriptions. The insurgents attacked any Germans within sight and seized their weapons. The Germans defended themselves <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> by shooting at the insurgents.|$|R
5|$|Charles XI {{had complained}} of stomach pains since 1694. In {{the summer of}} 1696, he asked his doctors for an opinion on the pain as it had {{continuously}} become worse, {{but they had no}} viable cure or treatment for it. He continued to perform his duties as usual, but, in February 1697, the pains became too severe for him to cope and he returned to Stockholm where the doctors discovered he had a large, hard lump in his stomach. At this point there was little the doctors could do except alleviate the King's pain <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> Charles XI died on 5 April 1697, in his forty-first year. An autopsy showed that the King had developed cancer and that it had spread through his entire abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the outpost on {{the left}} around the Isurava {{ridgeline}} held on throughout 27 August, but as the Japanese began bypassing the position, the order was given to withdraw across the ridgeline to the west. After this, frontal attacks against the dug-in defenders in the main defensive position began, representing the start {{of what would be}} four days of violent attacks. The attack was supported by a mountain gun and mortars that had been manhandled up the track. As the first wave fell on the position, the Australians sought to conceal their positions <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> firing as late as possible. Humidity and physical exertion sapped the strength of the attacking Japanese and the initial assault was held. That night, as heavy rain fell, the assault on the 39th around Isurava resumed, with a force penetrating the Australian positions around the abandoned garden.|$|E
5|$|Rowell was {{promoted}} to colonel on 13 October 1939, and when the government decided to form I Corps in April 1940, Blamey was given the command and Rowell became brigadier, general staff (BGS), with the rank of brigadier. Blamey and Rowell prepared I Corps for operations <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> completing the force's structure and integrating new units as they arrived in the Middle East. Rowell strove to establish {{good relations with the}} British Army, while occasionally having to remind them that the AIF was answerable to its own commander in chief and its own government. Rowell's efforts to create an administrative headquarters to free the I Corps staff for operational duties foundered on Blamey's reluctance to delegate authority. The best that he could achieve was the creation of a Base and Line of Communications Units command under Brigadier Allan Boase but I Corps remained responsible for organisation and training.|$|E
50|$|On 21 March, the {{two sides}} {{witnessed}} a brief cease fire. The day was quiet without a single shot. By this point in time, however, thousands of residents had fled the city. Those whom remained pressed on with life <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> while both factions licked their wounds. It was also on this day that the Macedonian army scaled Kale Hill under cover of artillery and gunfire.|$|R
50|$|When Nathaniel Gilbert died in 1774 {{his work}} in Antigua was {{continued}} by his brother Francis Gilbert to approximately 200 Methodists.

40|$|As part of {{a larger}} study, elderly {{applicants}} to institutions and elderly residents of the community were questioned on their potential interest in active euthanasia. Of these, 19 percent and 23 percent respectively said they would want a lethal injection. A further ten and nine percent respectively said they would want a lethal pill, if ever hopelessly ill. Most elderly community residents who would prefer to carry on <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> nevertheless thought that alternatives should be available to those wanting them...|$|R
5|$|Shortly after dark, around 7:00p.m., {{the first}} Ottoman counterattack {{came after a}} group from the 1st Battalion, 57th Regiment, under Major Zeki Bey, arrived to {{reinforce}} the battalions of the 47th. Attacking with hand grenades, the fighting {{took place in the}} complicated maze of the former Ottoman trench system. The close quarters meant that some of the grenades would travel back and forth up to three times before exploding. The Australians held the old Ottoman fire trench and had footholds deeper in Ottoman lines. They blocked the Ottoman communications trenches <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> often with the bodies of the dead, to thwart raids. Other bodies were moved to unused communication trenches and saps, and where possible the wounded were evacuated, however, the fighting was so intense, the conditions so cramped and the men so exhausted that in many cases they were left to lie {{at the bottom of the}} trench.|$|E
5|$|Rockefeller {{and his son}} {{continued}} to consolidate their oil interests <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> until New Jersey, in 1909, changed its incorporation laws to effectively allow a re-creation of the trust {{in the form of}} a single holding company. Rockefeller retained his nominal title as president until 1911 and he kept his stock. At last in 1911, the Supreme Court of the United States found Standard Oil Company of New Jersey in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. By then the trust still had a 70% market share of the refined oil market but only 14% of the U.S. crude oil supply. The court ruled that the trust originated in illegal monopoly practices and ordered it to be broken up into 34 new companies. These included, among many others, Continental Oil, which became Conoco, now part of ConocoPhillips; Standard of Indiana, which became Amoco, now part of BP; Standard of California, which became Chevron; Standard of New Jersey, which became Esso (and later, Exxon), now part of ExxonMobil; Standard of New York, which became Mobil, now part of ExxonMobil; and Standard of Ohio, which became Sohio, now part of BP. Pennzoil and Chevron have remained separate companies.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{stations}} called Radio London ("Big L") {{was so successful}} that the BBC was told to copy it <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> This led to a complete overhaul by Frank Gillard the BBC's Director of Radio of the BBC output creating the four analogue channels that still {{form the basis of}} its broadcasting today.

50|$|The {{two ships}} were put {{side-by-side}} {{and prepared for}} winter <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> It was a disastrous winter. Cold, famine, and scurvy destroyed most of the men. Jensen had died on 20 February 1620. Only Munk and two sailors survived to return, leaving no settlement in the New World. The frigate Enhiørningen had been broken down by ice during the winter. However, the smaller Lamprenen could be salvaged. The return trip lasted two months. The surviving crew members aboard the Lamprenen reached Bergen, Norway on 20 September 1620.|$|R

A former British militia commander led a force primarily of Indians and attacked the settlement.

25|$|A hasty last-minute air {{evacuation}} from Long Tieng on 14 and 15 May 1975 moved 2,500 Hmong to Thailand. However, {{the overwhelming majority}} of the Hmong were left on foot to find their way <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> Many of them walked south to Thailand for refuge. By the end of 1975, there were 54,000 Hmong refugees known to be in Thai refugee camps; an equal number were believed to have found shelter with relatives in northern Thailand.|$|E
25|$|The {{remnants}} of the Scots Greys retreated to the British lines, harried by French cavalry. They eventually reformed on the left, supporting {{the rest of the}} line <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> with carbine fire. In all, the Scots Greys suffered 104 dead and 97 wounded and 228 of the 416 horses. When they were finally reformed, the Scots Greys could only field two weakened squadrons, rather than the three complete ones with which they had begun the day.|$|E
25|$|On 27 September 1915, Townshend's forces {{approached}} the Ottoman {{positions at the}} Es Sinn. Over the previous days, air and cavalry reconnaissance had scouted the area and located the camouflaged Ottoman defenses <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> Scouts had discovered that the area between the Ataba and Suwaikiya Marshes, north of the Ottoman lines, was passable for a heavy formation. Rather than attacking the position head on, Townshend opted for a complicated plan to envelop the Nureddin's forces.|$|E

25|$|On December 13, General James M. Shackelford was {{commanding}} Union forces near Bean's Station on the Holston River. Longstreet {{decided to}} go back and capture Bean’s Station. Three Confederate columns and artillery approached Bean's Station to catch the Federals in a vise. By 2:00a.m. on December 14, one column was skirmishing with Union pickets. The pickets held out <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> and warned Shackelford of the Confederate presence. He deployed his force for an assault.

25|$|Hiding {{themselves}} <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> with aerials strung up in attics or {{disguised as}} washing lines, they tapped out Morse {{on the key}} of transmitters, and would often wait hours for a reply while alone waiting for a signal in reply saying the messages were received. If they stayed on the air transmitting for more than 20 minutes, their signals {{were likely to be}} picked up by the enemy, and detection vans would trace the source of these suspect signals. When the operator moved location, the bulky transmitter had to be carried, sometimes concealed in a suitcase or in a bundle of firewood. If stopped and searched, the operator would have no cover story to explain the transmitter. In 1943, an operator's life expectancy was six weeks.|$|E
25|$|In Switzerland, Schur's colleagues Heinz Hopf and George Pólya were {{informed}} of the dismissal of Issai Schur in 1935.

George Pólya arranged from this invitation of the Mathematical Seminars the Conference of the Department of Mathematics and Physics on December 16.

Researchers interviewed 29 men and women over 50 years of age about whether and how they treated recent illnesses and with what results. Several themes arose from the interviews. Many critical obstacles to successful health treatment existed. However, participants creatively used various methods to try to negotiate a flawed healthcare system <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> Participants blended religious/spiritual approaches including herbs, fasting, and prayer with western medicines, increased dependence on their social networks, and used various components of Ghana 2 ̆ 7 s National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) to varying degrees...|$|R
50|$|In 1934, the Belgian {{government}} again cut off {{funding for}} the project, and the offices were closed. (Otlet protested by keeping vigil outside the locked offices, but to no avail.) The collection remained untouched within those offices, however, until 1940, when Germany invaded Belgium. Requisitioning the Mundaneum's quarters to hold a collection of Third Reich art and destroying substantial amounts of its collections in the process, the Germans forced Otlet and his colleagues {{to find a new}} home for the Mundaneum. In a large but decrepit building in Leopold Park they reconstituted the Mundaneum <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> and there it remained until it was forced to move again in 1972, well after Otlet's death.|$|R
25|$|Africans {{captured}} {{as slaves}} {{no longer had}} the sort of resources to practice hair grooming that they had had when home. Slaves adapted <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> under the circumstances, finding sheep-fleece carding tools particularly useful for detangling their hair. They suffered from scalp diseases and infestations due to their deplorable living conditions. Slaves used varying remedies for disinfecting and cleansing their scalps, such as applying kerosene or cornmeal directly on the scalp with a cloth as they carefully parted the hair. For field work, male slaves shaved their hair and wore hats to protect their scalps against the sun. House slaves had to appear tidy and well-groomed. The men sometimes wore wigs mimicking their masters', or similar hairstyles, while the women typically plaited or braided their hair. During the 19th century, hair styling, especially among women, became more popular. Cooking grease such as lard, butter and goose grease, were used to moisturize the hair. Female slaves sometimes used hot butterknives to curl their hair.|$|E
25|$|Alerted to {{imminent}} danger, the British commander instantly {{ordered a}} retreat {{across the bridge}} at Arzobispo. For his part, Cuesta immediately led his army in retreat from Talavera to Oropesa, abandoning the British hospitals. With only about 40 wagons and carts available, 1,500 badly wounded men were left behind. The remainder were told {{to make their way}} <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> Eventually, 2,000 hobbled into the British lines. Another 500 either died en route or were captured by the French. The ones who were made prisoner by the French were well cared for. Cuesta could have crossed the Tagus at Talavera and retreated on the south bank. However, the roads on that side pass through the Sierra de Guadalupe and were so bad that the Spanish army would have had to abandon its artillery and wagon train. Instead, Cuesta took the risk of marching on the north bank, where the French were known to be at large.|$|E
25|$|Further {{operations}} followed, but disaster came on 3 May 1943, when an 11-aircraft Ramrod raid– one to {{be continued}} regardless of losses– against Amsterdam resulted {{in the loss of}} {{all but one of the}} squadron's Venturas. After crossing the Dutch coast, the Venturas were bounced by a group of 70 to 80 German fighters. They penetrated the Spitfire escort and got in amongst 487 Squadron's bombers, damaging one and forcing it to return to base. The squadron pressed on, with further losses; by the time the Venturas had begun their bomb run, only five aircraft remained. The Germans then proceeded to pick them off, although they fought back <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> with Squadron Leader Leonard Trent downing one attacker with his machine-guns as the German fighter flew across his nose. Finally only Trent's aircraft remained in the air. Reaching the target, he pressed home his attack, dropping his payload– narrowly missing the target, but causing some damage– before he too was shot down.|$|E
50|$|When {{reports of}} the {{incident}} at the Rand Club reached Pretoria by telegraph, Smuts resorted to personal action. He and Botha grabbed a car, and drove to Johannesburg, without accompaniment by assistance or bodyguard. They drove slowly and quietly to the centre of Johannesburg, <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> without being seen. A meeting with the Strike Committee was arranged, but what Smuts and Botha had assumed would be a professional meeting resembled a hostage situation, as the two were held at gun-point as they were dictated the unions’ terms. With the authorities being beaten {{on the streets of}} Johannesburg, secondary strikes breaking out across South Africa, and guns literally pointing at their heads, Smuts and Botha were forced to meet the strikers’ demands.|$|R

25|$|Unlike in {{classical}} Antiquity, the warships of the 6th century did not feature rams; naval combat was therefore dominated by missile exchanges and boarding actions. In {{this form of}} combat, experience {{and the ability to}} maintain a formation of ships was essential, and the Byzantine crews held the advantage over the inexperienced Goths. Soon, in the heat of battle, some Gothic ships drifted off the main body and were easily destroyed, while others sailed too close together and were unable to maneuver. In the end, the weary Gothic fleet disintegrated and their ships fled <b>as</b> <b>best</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>could.</b> <b>They</b> lost 36 ships, and Gibal was captured, while Indulf with the remainder fled towards Ancona. As soon as he came close to the Gothic army's camp, he beached his ships and set them on fire.|$|R
