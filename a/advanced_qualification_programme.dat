40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} the integrity static analysis approach developed {{to support the}} justification of commercial off-the-shelf software (COTS) used in a safety-related system. The static analysis {{was part of an}} overall software <b>qualification</b> <b>programme,</b> which also included the work reported in our paper presented at Safecomp 2002 [1]. Integrity static analysis focuses on unsafe language constructs and “covert ” flows, where one thread can affect the data or control flow of another thread. The analysis addressed two main aspects: the internal integrity of the code (especially for the more critical functions), and the intra-component integrity, checking for covert channels. The analysis process was supported by an aggregation of tools, combined and engineered to support the checks done and to scale as necessary. Integrity static analysis is feasible for industrial scale software, did not require unreasonable resources and we provide data that illustrates its contribution to the software <b>qualification</b> <b>programme.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{developments}} within activation policies emphasise tailor-made and individualised services; however, {{little is}} known of what {{the effects of these}} initiatives are. The aim of this study was, therefore, to analyse, in a cluster-randomised design, the long-term effects of an individualised follow-up model on welfare recipients' self-sufficiency. The follow-up model systematises the work done by social workers within the <b>Qualification</b> <b>Programme,</b> which is a welfare-to-work programme in Norway. In the study, 18 labour and welfare offices were randomised to experimental and control groups. The data consist of baseline questionnaires for <b>Qualification</b> <b>Programme</b> participants (n = 617) and follow-ups based on administrative data at 12, 24 and 30 months after baseline. The results show significant effects of individualised follow-up on self-sufficiency at the 30 -month follow-up and strong positive trends at the 18 - and 24 -month follow-ups. Thus, comprehensive and individualised follow-up of participants within activation programmes seems to generate positive long-term effects on self-sufficienc...|$|R
