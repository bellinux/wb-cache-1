25|$|When {{journalists and}} {{physicians}} began {{focusing on the}} narcotic contents of the patent medicines, some of their makers began replacing the opium tincture laudanum with <b>acetanilide,</b> a particularly toxic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with analgesic as well as antipyretic properties that had been introduced into medical practice under the name Antifebrin by A. Cahn and P. Hepp in 1886. But this ingredient change probably killed more of the nostrum's users than the original narcotics did, since <b>acetanilide</b> not only caused an alarming cyanosis due to methemoglobinemia but was later discovered to cause liver and kidney damage.|$|E
25|$|The {{occasional}} {{reports of}} acetanilide-induced cyanosis prompted {{the search for}} supposedly less toxic aniline derivatives, such as phenacetin. After several conflicting results over the ensuing fifty years, it was ultimately established in 1948 that <b>acetanilide</b> was mostly metabolized to paracetamol (known in the United States as USAN: acetaminophen) in the human body, {{and that it was}} this metabolite that was responsible for its analgesic and antipyretic properties. <b>Acetanilide</b> is no longer used as a drug in its own right, although the success of its metabolite – paracetamol (acetaminophen) – is well known.|$|E
25|$|Many {{substances}} {{are potentially}} harmful {{to people with}} G6PD deficiency. Variation {{in response to these}} substances makes individual predictions difficult. Antimalarial drugs that can cause acute hemolysis in people with G6PD deficiency include primaquine, pamaquine, and chloroquine. There is evidence that other antimalarials may also exacerbate G6PD deficiency, but only at higher doses. Sulfonamides (such as sulfanilamide, sulfamethoxazole, and mafenide), thiazolesulfone, methylene blue, and naphthalene should also be avoided by people with G6PD deficiency as they antagonize folate synthesis, as should certain analgesics (such as phenazopyridine and <b>acetanilide)</b> and a few non-sulfa antibiotics (nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, isoniazid, dapsone, and furazolidone). Henna has been known to cause hemolytic crisis in G6PD-deficient infants. Rasburicase is also contraindicated in G6PD deficiency. High dose intravenous vitamin C has also been known to cause haemolysis in G6PD deficiency carriers, thus G6PD deficiency testing is routine before infusion of doses of 25g or more.|$|E

50|$|In 1946-1947, while {{studying}} at Yale, he coauthored with Leon Greenberg {{a series of}} three papers on <b>acetanilide,</b> an analgesic that was still in use at the time, aiming to establish why it caused methemoglobinemia. Although {{more than half a century}} had passed since <b>acetanilide</b> was first used clinically, there was wide-ranging disagreement concerning its metabolism, and numerous theories had been postulated. The first of these three papers summarized these theories, and reexamined the proportion of various <b>acetanilide</b> metabolites in human urine. Finding that p-aminophenol conjugates were excreted, they refuted the earlier theories that the accumulation of this substance in the body was causing methemoglobinemia. Of far greater impact was the second paper in this series, showing that paracetamol was a metabolite of <b>acetanilide</b> in the blood. The third paper in the series reported that even large amounts of paracetamol (up to 4 grams per kg of body weight) did not produce methemoglobinemia in albino rats.
