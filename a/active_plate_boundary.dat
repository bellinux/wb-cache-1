Of the 846 earthquakes whose original bulletin epicenters were located in Atlantic Ocean crust and were at least 2 ° from <b>active</b> <b>plate</b> <b>boundaries,</b> 289 {{were found to be}} reliably intraplate. A significant number (237) of the original epicenters were actually mis-located interplate earthquakes that located to <b>active</b> <b>plate</b> <b>boundaries</b> upon relocation, or whose 95 % confidence locations determined through Monte Carlo simulations intersected seismically active boundaries. Many of these erroneous locations, partic-ularly in regions surrounding the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, frequently appear in global seismicity maps. The resulting reliable catalog of intraplate seismicity is not ran-domly distributed but shows significant clustering in space and time. Much of the seismicity is associated with the locations of hot spots, such as the Bermuda, Canary, and Cape Verde Islands. Seismicity is also clustered around other tectonic features, such as the diffuse <b>plate</b> <b>boundary</b> between North America and South America, and the fossil spreading ridge between Greenland and North America. While we did not examine intraplate arthquakes within 2 ° of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and some of our unreliable near-ridge earthquakes may be truly intraplate, we do not find an indication within our "reliable " data set of an increase in intraplate seismicity with increased proximity to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge beyond our 2 ° limit...|$|R

The Taconic Orogeny was just the first of a series of mountain building plate collisions that contributed to the formation of the Appalachians, culminating in the collision of North America and Africa (see Appalachian orogeny).|$|E

30|$|Many <b>active</b> <b>plate</b> <b>boundaries,</b> such as mid-ocean {{ridges and}} trenches, {{are under the}} sea. Seafloor crustal {{deformation}} data will contribute significantly to understanding {{the nature of the}} tectonic processes at these <b>plate</b> <b>boundaries.</b> We have developed a seafloor positioning system with a GPS-acoustic link. This system consists of two main components; (1) the surface positioning by differential GPS to on-land reference and (2) the precise acoustic ranging using the M-sequence between the surface and seafloor references. The position and attitude of the surface GPS-acoustic link unit are determined from the GPS observations. Simultaneously, the acoustic ranging between the surface unit and seafloor references are carried out. The positions of the seafloor references are determined from these observations and a sound-speed structure model of the seawater. We performed preliminary seafloor positioning experiments. In these experiments, simple 1 -D structure models are assumed for the sound-speed in the sea. The results show that the positions of the seafloor references are estimated with an accuracy on order of 10 cm. The residuals for acoustic ranging imply that there are systematic differences between the assumed and real sound-speed structure. It is necessary to reduce the uncertainties of sound-speed structures for more accurate positioning.|$|R

40|$|Mechanical fault {{reactivation}} is {{a mechanism}} where high fluid pressures generated within a fault zone {{can change the}} effective stress such that an optimally orientated fault segment will rupture. This style of strain has been recognized in three settings: (1) deep crustal locations at greenschist and higher-grade metamorphism with fluid generation; (2) <b>active</b> <b>plate</b> <b>boundaries</b> where tectonic stresses can result in seismicity; and (3) hydrocarbon column buoyancy pressure reactivation of critically stressed fault-bound traps. This paper examines category 3 {{in the context of}} mechanical fault reactivation and capillary processes. For water-wetting fault rock, mechanical reactivation may be reached prior to the capillary seal capacity. However, the non-wetting fluid cannot access the fault rock pore space until the hydrocarbon column height reaches the capillary threshold pressure. At the threshold pressure, the non-wetting fluid enters the fault rock imparting a buoyancy pressure in excess of the mechanical reactivation threshold causing rupture. This suggests that in certain circumstances the mechanical fault reactivation by buoyancy pressure is more accurately predicted by the capillary threshold pressure than mechanical reactivation pressure...|$|R

The present work integrates geological, geomorphological, structural, and seismological data in order to define the main potentially active faults in the region.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{reviews the}} current state of knowledge of non-living resource potentials within the extended "legal " continental shelf (ELCS). The ELCS lies beyond the 200 nautical mile jurisdiction of nation states' exclusive economic zones, but within the outer limits defined by the criteria established under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Article 76 (1982). The offshore non-living resource potentials are based on a statistical evaluation of known occurrences and reserves, the geologic environments favourable for their formation, models for sediment type and thickness, and basement composition. The result is an assessment of the potential for non-living marine resources to occur. The resources are divided into different types, based on their origin. Each is treated separately with a brief description of modes of formation followed by location, grade and resource estimate. Because placer deposits, comprising heavy minerals, gold and diamonds, are limited to near-shore areas they have negligible resource potential in the ELCS regions. Similarly, because phosphorite occurs mainly in the equatorial oceans between 400 m and 1, 500 m depth, they too have limited resource potential in ELCS areas. Evaporite deposits occur on many continental margins. However, they only occur within ELCS regions off eastern North America and western central Africa, where their resource potential is low. Polymetallic sulphides (PMS) are formed at volcanically <b>active</b> <b>plate</b> <b>boundaries.</b> With the exception of parts of the west Pacific and off the western coast of North America, where volcanically <b>active</b> <b>plate</b> <b>boundaries</b> are close to the continental margin, PMS resources are low in the ELCS regions. The major resource potential within the ELCS regions is held in iron-manganese nodules and crusts, oil, gas and gas hydrates. Four elemental metals are the main components of value in manganese nodules and crusts: manganese, copper, nickel and cobalt. Extrapolating known occurrences world wide, the total amount of these nodules and crusts within the ELCS regions may be as much as thirteen billion tonnes. Conventional oil and gas comprise an estimated 106 b. b. o. e. (billion barrels of oil equivalent) with a similar estimate of 115 b. b. o. e. for gas hydrates. In total, the resource potential (excluding recovery and production costs) contained within the ELCS regions of the world amounts to an estimated US$ 11, 934 trillions (at today's raw commodity prices) ...|$|R

Understanding the Quaternary history and sediments of the DSF {{requires}} investigation into the Neogene development of this <b>plate</b> <b>boundary.</b> DSF lateral motion preceded significant extension and rift morphology by - 10 Ma. Sediments of the Sedom Formation, dated here between 5. 0 0. 5 Ma and 6. 2 +/- 451 Ma, yielded extremely lowl Be concentrations and 26 A 1 is absent. These reflect the antiquity of the sediments, deposited in the Sedom Lagoon, which evolved in a subdued landscape and was connected to the Mediterranean Sea. The base of the overlying Amora Formation, deposited in the terminal Amora Lake which developed under increasing relief that promoted escarpment incision, was dated at 3. 311 Ma. Burial ages of fluvial sediments within caves (3. 4 +/- 0. 2 Ma and 3. 6 +/- 0. 4 Ma) represent the timing of initial incision. Initial DSF topography coincides with the earliest Red Sea MORB's and the East Anatolian fault initiation. These suggest a change in the relative Arabian-African plate motion.
