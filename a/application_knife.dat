40|$|AIM:To {{research}} clinical {{effect of}} two manual chopping methods for small incision extracapsular cataract extraction. METHODS: We observed 143 cases(184 eyes) with grade Ⅳ or higher taken the small incision cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation. Patients were given randomly knifed chopping with closed hook(92 eyes) or double knifed chopping(92 eyes). The intra-operative posterior capsule rupture was observed and compared. At 1 d, 1 wk and 1 mo postoperatively, visual acuity, corneal edema and corneal astigmatism were observed and analyzed. RESULTS:There were 10 eyes in patients accepting knifed chopping with closed hook with intra-operative posterior capsule rupture and 1 eye in patients accepting double knifed chopping. The {{difference between the}} two groups was statistically significant. The visual acuity of patients accepting knifed chopping with closed hook(92 eyes) at 1 d postoperatively was 0. 380 ± 0. 105, and that of patients accepting double knifed chopping(92 eyes) was 0. 420 ± 0. 095; the {{difference between the two}} groups was statistically significant. The visual acuity of patients accepting knifed chopping with closed hook(84 eyes) at 1 wk postoperatively was 0. 480 ± 0. 123, and that of patients accepting double knifed chopping(86 eyes) was 0. 520 ± 0. 085; the {{difference between the two groups}} was statistically significant. The visual acuity of patients accepting knifed chopping with closed hook(60 eyes) at 1 mo postoperatively was 0. 610 ± 0. 083, and that of patients accepting double knifed chopping(52 eyes) was 0. 643 ± 0. 072; the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. The differences on corneal edema and corneal astigmatism between the two methods at 1 d, 1 wk and 1 mo postoperatively were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION:The <b>application</b> of <b>knifed</b> chopping with closed hook and double knifed chopping in small incision extracapsular cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation can effectively treat with cataract with grade Ⅳ or higher. The most important difference is on the capsular rupture which causes the different recover periods after the two operations.

Several tissue effects {{are associated with}} the use of different surgical instruments. The aim of the present study was to compare tissue damage following the <b>application</b> of cold <b>knife</b> biopsy, bipolar electrocoagulation and the ultracision harmonic scalpel, through the analysis of inflammatory gene mediator expression. Three fragments of the round ligament (length 0. 5 cm) were obtained from 22 females who had undergone total or subtotal laparoscopic hysterectomy using three different modes of resection: Cold knife biopsy, bipolar electrocoagulation and ultracision harmonic scalpel. The tissue fragments were examined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of selected cytokines. Gene expression analysis demonstrated large standard deviations due to individual variability among patients and indicated variability in the concentrations of cytokines in the three different samples. The quantity of cytokine mRNA in the cold knife biopsy samples was generally greater than those obtained by other techniques. Tumor necrosis factor-α expression was significantly higher in the sample obtained with the ultracision harmonic scalpel and bipolar electrocoagulation (P= 0. 033) when compared with cold knife biopsy. The inflammatory response was analyzed by the quantification of gene expression through the use of qPCR. The ultracision harmonic scalpel and bipolar electrocoagulation triggered the inflammatory cascade and resulted in an increased production of cytokines compared with cold knife biopsy...|$|R

The Leksell Gamma Knife utilizes 201 intersecting 60 Co beams and four helmets with different size collimators to form four standard clinical beam sizes of 18, 14, 8 and 4 mm nominal diameter and a total geometrical accuracy in dose delivery {{of the order of}} 0. 5 mm (Leksell Gamma Unit User’s Manual Vol. 2). Quality assurance checks were made for every step of the entire planning and treatment procedure, including mechanical accuracy, precise dose delivery, Automatic Positioning System (APS) accuracy, as well as imaging and target localization accuracy, in order to guarantee a high quality standard. The polymer gel (Vipar and Pabig) - magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dosimetry method is being used due to its inherent three-dimensional feature and linear dose response over the range of gamma <b>knife</b> <b>applications.</b> Percentage relative dose results are presented not only in the form of one dimensional profiles but also planar isocontours and isosurfaces in three dimensions. Experimental results are compared with corresponding Gammaplan treatment planning system calculations as well as radiochromic film measurements. A good agreement, within the experimental uncertainty, has been observed between measured and expected dose distributions. Accuracy of the experimental data depends on the scanning resolution in MRI. Pituitary adenoma treatment by using four 8 mm and one 14 mm collimator helmet shots delivers to the 50 % isodose line, a prescription dose of 15 Gy (30 Gy maximum dose) to the target. The comparison of experimental and theoretical data in terms of percentage isodose contours on axial, coronal and sagittal planes, as well as 3 D plan evaluation criteria such as dose-volume histograms for the target volume, target coverage and conformity indices, were in good argument. The multiple metastasis treatment plan includes planning system calculations in different dose matrices which are be combined in the final stage of the calculations. The accuracy of APS, maximum dose and increased intra-target distances has been verified. Measured dose distributions were found to agree with corresponding treatment planning calculations, besides statistical fluctuation of experimental results. On average, distance to agreement between experimental and calculated dose distributions was satisfied within the experimental uncertainty of the order of one pixel in the MRI gel readout session (< 1 mm). The measured and calculated DVH results were in good agreement. ...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of AgronomyDavid B. MengelResearch {{has shown}} that {{nitrogen}} fertilizer is needed most years to optimize winter wheat yields in Kansas. Anhydrous ammonia (AA) {{has long been a}} favorite N fertilizer of producers as it {{has proven to be a}} reliable and economical source of N. Anhydrous application methods and equipment have changed little over the past 70 years. Recently John Deere has developed their 2510 HSLD (2510 H) anhydrous ammonia applicator designed to improve efficiency and performance in no-till systems. The 2510 H is designed to be run at high speed with low soil disturbance and low draft. This is achieved by using a rolling coulter type injection unit, designed much like modern single disk opener grain drill units, to apply AA at relatively shallow depths. With this low soil disturbance design, topdress AA applications may also be possible. Due to the environmental risks associated with wheat production, many Kansas producers prefer an N management system that consists of a “starter” application at planting with the majority of the N fertilizer applied in the spring. This approach makes certain that the crop survives the winter before the investment in N is made and eliminates the potential for fertilizer N being lost over the winter months. It has not been feasible to use AA for topdressing in the past due to the damage to the growing crop from <b>application</b> with traditional <b>knife</b> style applicators. The first part of this research revisits traditional preplant AA application methods by evaluating proper unit spacing and the use of nitrification inhibitors as well as comparing these AA treatments to common topdress applications of N. Over three site years, few consistently significant advantages between unit spacing, use of nitrification inhibitor or N management method were found. Unit spacing did show a notable trend favoring 50 cm spacing. The second part of this research was a two-year experiment conducted with the objective of assessing the feasibility of topdressing with AA using the 2510 H as compared with topdressing with granular urea. A number of factors such as application direction in relation to crop row, speed of application and timing as a function of crop development were examined to minimize crop injury and maximize crop yield. The initial 2010 study was promising, showing no significant yield loss topdressing with AA compared to topdressing with urea. The experiment was repeated at two locations in 2011. Results were mixed, indicated that soil conditions and the plants ability to recover from the AA application injury were important for the success of topdressing with AA. Lastly, an economic evaluation of the production economics of preplant and topdress AA was compared to the traditional practice of topdressing winter wheat with urea. Through evaluation of the agronomic and economic factors affecting the feasibility of uses of AA and the 2510 H, three main conclusions can be made: 1. Preplant application of AA has no agronomic advantage and only a small economic advantage over topdressing with urea when yields are the same. 2. Topdressing with AA is agronomically feasible but is at an economic disadvantage when compared to topdressing with urea, due to the yield reduction associated with the AA method. 3. Further research focused on reducing yield loss with topdress AA applications is needed before this N management strategy can be promoted on a large scale...|$|R
40|$|Quality knives are {{typically}} fabricated from high-strength steel alloys. Depending on the application, {{there are different}} requirements for mechanical and physical properties that cause problems for steel alloys. For example, diver's knives are generally used in salt water, which causes rust in steel knives. Titanium diver's knives are a popular alternative due to their salt water corrosion resistance, but are too soft to maintain a sharp cutting edge. Steel knives are also magnetic, which is undesirable for military <b>applications</b> where the <b>knives</b> are used as a tactical tool for diffusing magnetic mines. Steel is also significantly denser than titanium (8 g/cu cm vs. 4. 5 g/cu cm), which results in heavier knives for the same size. Steel is hard and wear-resistant, compared with titanium, and can keep a sharp edge during service. A major drawback of both steel and titanium knives is {{that they must be}} ground or machined into the final knife shape from a billet. Since most knives have a mirrored surface and a complex shape, manufacturing them is complex. It would be more desirable if the knife could be cast into a net or near-net shape in a single step. The solution to the deficiencies of titanium, steel, and ceramic knives is to fabricate them using bulk metallic glasses (or composites). These alloys can be cast into net or near-net shaped knives with a combination of properties that exceed both titanium and steel. A commercially viable BMG (bulk metallic glass) or composite knife is one that exhibits one or all of the following properties: It is based on titanium, has a self-sharpening edge, can retain an edge during service, is hard, is non-magnetic, is corrosion-resistant against a variety of corrosive environments, is tough (to allow for prying), can be cast into a net-shape with a mirror finish and a complex shape, has excellent wear resistance, and is low-density. These properties can be achieved in BMG and composites through alloy chemistry and processing. For each desired property for knife fabrication and performance, there is an alloy development strategy that optimizes behavior. Although BMG knives have been demonstrated as far back as 1995, they never found commercial success because they had to be ground (which presented problems because the alloys contained beryllium), they weren't low cost (because they weren't cast to a net-shape), they were brittle (because they were made with a low-quality commercial material), and they had extremely poor corrosion resistance (because corrosion was not well-understood in these materials). Ultimately, these shortcomings prevented the widespread commercialization. In the current work, the inventors have applied {{more than a decade of}} research on BMGs from Caltech and JPL to develop a better understanding of how to make BMG knives that exhibit an optimal combination of properties, processing and cost. Alloys have been developed based in titanium (and other metals), that exhibit high toughness, high hardness, excellent corrosion resistance, no ferromagnetism, edge-retaining selfsharpening, and the ability to be cast like a plastic using commercially available casting techniques (currently used by commercial companies such as Liquidmetal Technologies and Visser Precision Casting). The inventors argue that depending on the application (diving, military, tactical, utility, etc.) there is an optimal combination of design and alloy composition. Moreover, with new casting technologies not available at the inception of these materials, net-shaped knives can be cast into complex shapes that require no aftermarket forming, except for sharpening using water-cooled polishing wheel. These combinations of discoveries seek to make low-cost BMG knives commercially viable products that have no equal among metal or ceramic knives. Current work at JPL focuses on net-shape casting of these alloys and testing their mechanical properties versus commercially available knives to demonstrate their benefits...|$|R
60|$|A {{conviction}} that the subject is ill understood by those who were unprepared for what has just been said, is the excuse to my own mind, Gentlemen, for having made so protracted a demand upon your attention. The ruinous tendencies of this self-flattering enterprize can only be checked by timely and general foresight. The contest {{in which we are}} engaged has been described by Persons noticing it from a distance, as the work of a Cabal of Electioneering Jobbers, who have contrived to set up the Thanet against the Lowther interests, that both Parties might spend their money for the benefit of those who cared for neither. The Thanet interest in the County of Westmoreland!--one might almost as well talk of an interest in the moon! The Descendant of the Cliffords has not thought it worth while to recommend himself to the Electors, by the course either of his public or his private life; and therefore, though his purse may have weight, and his possessions are considerable, he himself, in reference to the supposed object, is nothing. If this had been really an attempt made by a numerous body of malcontent Freeholders to carry their wishes for a change into effect, by placing at their head some approved Chief of an ancient Family, possessed of real consequence in the County, the proceeding, considered in the abstract, could not have been objected to. This County is, and ever was, open to fair and honourable contest, originating in principles sanctioned by general practice; and carried on by means which, if universally adopted, would not be injurious to the State. But the present measure stands not upon any such grounds; it is an attempt, no matter with what ultimate view, TO EFFECT A TOTAL CHANGE IN THE CHARACTER OF COUNTY ELECTIONS; beginning here with the expectation, as is openly avowed, of being imitated elsewhere. It reverses the order hitherto pursued. Instead of aiming to influence the less wealthy and less instructed Freeholders through the medium of those whom they have been accustomed to confide in--instead of descending by legitimate gradations from high to lower, from the well-instructed and widely-experienced to those who have not had equal advantages--it commences at the bottom; far beneath the degree of the poorest Freeholders; and works upwards, with an inflammatory appeal to feelings that owe their birth to previous mistatement of facts. Opulence, rank, station, privilege, distinction, intellectual culture--the notions naturally following upon these in a Country like England are protection, succour, guidance, example, dissemination of knowledge, introduction of improvements, and all the benefits and blessings that among Freemen are diffused, where authority like the parental, from a sense of community of interest and the natural goodness of mankind, is softened into brotherly concern. This is no Utopian picture of the characteristics of elevated rank, wealth, competence, and learned and liberal education in England; for, with the liberty of speech and writing that prevails amongst us, if such rays of light and love did not generally emanate from superiority of station, possessions, and accomplishment, the frame of society, which we behold, could not subsist. Yes--in spite of pride, hardness of heart, grasping avarice, and other selfish passions, the not unfrequent concomitants of affluence and worldly prosperity, the mass of the people are justly dealt with, and tenderly cherished;--accordingly, gratitude without servility; dispositions to prompt return of service, undebased by officiousness; and respectful attachment, that, with small prejudice to the understanding, greatly enriches the heart: such are the sentiments with which Englishmen of the humblest condition have been accustomed to look up towards their Friends and Benefactors. Among the holders of fixed property (whether labourers in the field or artisans); among those who are fortunate enough to have an interest in the soil of their Country; these human sentiments of civil life are strengthened by additional dependencies.--I am aware how much universal habits of rapacious speculation, occasioned by fluctuations in the value of produce during the late war--how much the spread of manufactories and the baleful operation of the Poor Laws, have done to impair these indigenous and salutary affections. I am conscious of the sad deterioration, and no one can lament it more deeply; but sufficient vitality is left in the Stock of ancient virtue to furnish hope that, by careful manuring, and skilful <b>application</b> of the <b>knife</b> to the withered branches, fresh shoots might thrive in their place--were it not for the base artifices of Malignants, who, pretending to invigorate the tree, pour scalding water and corrosive compounds among its roots; so that the fibres are killed in the mould by which they have been nourished.|$|R
