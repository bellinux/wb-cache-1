5|$|There are {{a number}} of drugs that can help prevent or {{interrupt}} malaria in travelers to places where infection is common. Many of these drugs are also used in treatment. Chloroquine may be used where chloroquine-resistant parasites are not common. In places where Plasmodium is resistant to one or more medications, three medications—mefloquine (Lariam), doxycycline (available generically), or the combination of <b>atovaquone</b> and proguanil hydrochloride (Malarone)—are frequently used when prophylaxis is needed. Doxycycline and the <b>atovaquone</b> plus proguanil combination are the best tolerated; mefloquine is associated with death, suicide, and neurological and psychiatric symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Mitochondrial genomes {{have far}} fewer genes than the {{bacteria}} {{from which they}} {{are thought to be}} descended. Although some have been lost altogether, many have been transferred to the nucleus, such as the respiratory complex II protein subunits. This is thought to be relatively common over evolutionary time. A few organisms, such as the Cryptosporidium, actually have mitochondria that lack any DNA, presumably because all their genes have been lost or transferred. In Cryptosporidium, the mitochondria have an altered ATP generation system that renders the parasite resistant to many classical mitochondrial inhibitors such as cyanide, azide, and <b>atovaquone.</b>|$|E
25|$|In immunocompromised patients, {{prophylaxis}} with co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole), <b>atovaquone,</b> {{or regular}} pentamidine inhalations {{may help prevent}} PCP.|$|E
25|$|Antipneumocystic {{medication}} is used with concomitant steroids {{in order to}} avoid inflammation, which causes an exacerbation of symptoms about four days after treatment begins if steroids are not used. By far the most commonly used {{medication is}} trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, but some patients are unable to tolerate this treatment due to allergies. Other medications that are used, alone or in combination, include pentamidine, trimetrexate, dapsone, <b>atovaquone,</b> primaquine, pafuramidine maleate (under investigation), and clindamycin. Treatment is usually for a period of about 21 days.|$|E
50|$|Proguanil {{displays}} synergism {{when used}} {{in combination with the}} antimalarial <b>atovaquone.</b> This mechanism of action differs from when proguanil was used as a singular agent. In this case, it is not thought to function as a DHFR inhibitor. The addition of proguanil has shown to reduce resistance to <b>atovaquone</b> and increase the ability of <b>atovaquone</b> to trigger a mitochondrial apoptotic cascade. This is commonly referred to as “collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential.” Proguanil lowers the effective concentration of <b>atovaquone</b> needed to increase permeability of the mitochondrial membrane.|$|E
50|$|A {{standard}} tablet of Malarone contains 100 mg of proguanil hydrochloride and 250 mg of <b>atovaquone.</b> A pediatric tablet contains 25 mg of proguanil hydrochloride and 62.5 mg of <b>atovaquone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Proguanil {{acts as a}} {{mitochondrial}} sensitiser and synergizes with <b>atovaquone.</b> When <b>atovaquone</b> {{is used as a}} sole agent, a high {{natural frequency}} of cytochrome b mutants leads to a high failure rate. This is potentially due to the high lipophilicity and slow uptake of <b>atovaquone,</b> which results in a relatively prolonged period of parasite exposure at ineffective concentrations. Specific mutations (Y268S, Y268C) have been shown to confer resistance in vivo, but the other mechanisms of resistance remain unknown.|$|E
50|$|<b>Atovaquone</b> (alternative spelling: atavaquone) is a {{chemical}} compound {{that belongs to}} the class of naphthoquinones. <b>Atovaquone</b> is a hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, an analog of ubiquinone, with antipneumocystic activity. It is manufactured in the US in the liquid form, or oral suspension, under the brand name Mepron.|$|E
50|$|<b>Atovaquone</b> is {{available}} in combination with proguanil under the name Malarone, albeit at a price higher than Lariam. It is commonly used in prophylaxis by travellers and used to treat falciparum malaria in developed countries. A liquid oral suspension of <b>Atovaquone</b> {{is available}} under the name Mepron.|$|E
50|$|Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX, Bactrim) is {{generally}} considered first-line therapy for PCP or toxoplasmosis. However, <b>atovaquone</b> {{may be used in}} patients who cannot tolerate, or are allergic to, sulfonamide medications such as TMP-SMX. In addition, <b>atovaquone</b> has the advantage of not causing myelosuppression, which is an important issue in patients who have undergone bone marrow transplantation.|$|E
50|$|Chloroquine {{may be used}} {{where the}} {{parasite}} is still sensitive. However, due to resistance one of three medications: mefloquine (Lariam), doxycycline (available generically), and the combination of <b>atovaquone</b> and proguanil hydrochloride (Malarone) is frequently needed. Doxycycline and the <b>atovaquone</b> and proguanil combination are the best tolerated with mefloquine associated with higher rates of neurological and psychiatric symptoms.|$|E

5000|$|The {{most often}} used {{treatments}} for cytauxzoonosis are imidocarb dipropionate and a combination of <b>atovaquone</b> and azithromycin. Although imidocarb {{has been used for}} years, it is not particularly effective. [...] In a large study, only 25% of cats treated with this drug and supportive care survived. 60% of sick cats treated with supportive care and the combination of the anti-malarial drug <b>atovaquone</b> and the antibiotic azithromycin survived infection.|$|E
50|$|Single-point {{mutations}} in cytochrome b of Plasmodium falciparum and P. berghei {{are associated with}} resistance to the anti-malarial drug <b>atovaquone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some {{have been}} commercialized as {{fungicides}} (the strobilurin derivatives, {{best known of}} which is azoxystrobin; QoI inhibitors) and as anti-malaria agents (<b>atovaquone).</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Atovaquone,</b> as a {{combination}} preparation with proguanil, has been commercially available from GlaxoSmithKline since 2000 as Malarone for the treatment and prevention of malaria.|$|E
5000|$|Cycloguanil is a {{dihydrofolate reductase}} inhibitor, {{and is a}} {{metabolite}} of the antimalarial drug proguanil; its formation in vivo has been thought to be primarily responsible for the antimalarial activity of proguanil. [...] However, more recent work has indicated that, while proguanil is synergistic with the drug <b>atovaquone</b> (as in the combination Malarone), cycloguanil is in fact antagonistic {{to the effects of}} <b>atovaquone,</b> suggesting that, unlike cycloguanil, proguanil may have an alternative mechanism of antimalarial action besides dihydrofolate reductase inhibition.|$|E

50|$|Proguanil is {{used for}} the {{prevention}} and treatment of malaria in both adults and children, particularly in areas where chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum malaria has been reported. It is usually taken in combination with <b>atovaquone,</b> another antimalarial drug.|$|E
50|$|<b>Atovaquone</b> is {{recommended}} {{to be used}} only in combination with another anti-malarial compound as the selection of resistant parasites occurs very quickly when used in mono-therapy. Resistance is thought to originate from a single-point mutation in the gene coding for cytochrome-b.|$|E
50|$|Proguanil, {{also known}} as chlorguanide and chloroguanide, is a {{medication}} used to treat and prevent malaria. It is often used together with chloroquine or <b>atovaquone.</b> When used with chloroquine the combination will treat mild chloroquine resistant malaria. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
5000|$|Intravenous {{quinidine}} is {{also indicated}} {{for treatment of}} Plasmodium falciparum malaria. [...] However, quinidine is not considered the first-line therapy for P. falciparum. The recommended treatments for P. falciparum malaria, according to the Toronto Notes 2008, are a combination of either quinine and doxycycline or <b>atovaquone</b> and proguanil (Malarone).|$|E
50|$|Natural or {{synthetic}} quinones show {{a biological}} or pharmacological activity, {{and some of}} them show anti-tumoral activity. They embody some claims in herbal medicine. These applications include purgative (sennosides), antimicrobial and antiparasitic (rhein- and saprorthoquinone, <b>atovaquone),</b> anti-tumor (emodin and juglone), inhibition of PGE2 biosynthesis (arnebinone and arnebifuranone) and anti-cardiovascular disease (tanshinone).|$|E
50|$|<b>Atovaquone</b> {{selectively}} inhibits the malarial cytochrome bc1 {{complex in}} the parasitic electron transport chain, collapsing the mitochondrial membrane potential. The malarial electron transport chain does not contribute significantly to ATP synthesis; thus, {{it is believed that}} parasite death is due to the indirect inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, which requires transport chain function and is essential to pyrimidine biosynthesis.|$|E
50|$|The drug {{combination}} atovaquone/proguanil (INNs, trade names Malarone, Malanil) is an antimalarial medication {{used in both}} the treatment and prevention of malaria. <b>Atovaquone</b> alone is not indicated for treatment or prevention of malaria as monotherapy (i.e., without proguanil). Atovaquone/proguanil has been commercially available from GlaxoSmithKline since 2000, and its patent expired in 2013. Malarone has applications for treating chloroquine-resistant malaria.|$|E
50|$|The {{combination}} of <b>atovaquone</b> and proguanil to treat malaria was patented by Glaxo Wellcome in 1999, and its patent protection expired in 2013. Glenmark Generics had a generic formulation {{approved by the}} U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011. In February 2013, the United Kingdom High Court revoked Glaxo's patent on account of obviousness, {{clearing the way for}} generic versions to be sold there.|$|E
50|$|Chloroquine {{has been}} {{extensively}} used in mass drug administrations, which {{may have contributed to}} the emergence and spread of resistance. It is recommended to check if chloroquine is still effective in the region prior to using it. In areas where resistance is present, other antimalarials, such as mefloquine or <b>atovaquone,</b> may be used instead. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend against treatment of malaria with chloroquine alone due to more effective combinations.|$|E
50|$|Buparvaquone is a hydroxynaphthoquinone {{antiprotozoal}} drug {{related to}} parvaquone and <b>atovaquone.</b> It is a promising compound for the therapy and prophylaxis {{of all forms}} of theileriosis. Buparvaquone has been shown to have anti-leishmanial activity in vitro. It can be used to treat bovine East Coast fever protozoa in vitro, along with the only other substance known - Peganum harmala. It is the only really effective commercial therapeutic product against bovine theileriosis, where it has been used since the late 1980s.|$|E

50|$|The {{prime example}} for MDR against {{antiparasitic}} drugs is malaria. Plasmodium vivax has become chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistant {{a few decades}} ago, and as of 2012 artemisinin-resistant Plasmodium falciparum has emerged in western Cambodia and western Thailand.Toxoplasma gondii can also become resistant to artemisinin, as well as <b>atovaquone</b> and sulfadiazine, but is not usually MDRAntihelminthic resistance is mainly reported in the veterinary literature, for example {{in connection with the}} practice of livestock drenching and has been recent focus of FDA regulation.|$|E

50|$|Several {{methods are}} {{available}} to manage and treat babesiosis in animals. In many cases, patients spontaneously recover, having only experienced mild symptoms undiagnosed as the disease. This occurrence is almost always seen in B. microti infections, which are generally {{more common in the}} United States. For B. divergens and more severe B. microti infections, the standard treatment historically for symptomatic individuals was oral or intravenous clindamycin with oral quinine. With the results of research completed in 2000, however, treatment regimens have been increasingly leaning towards oral <b>atovaquone</b> with oral azithromycin. The latter medications are preferred, as they are equally effective in all but the most severe cases and exhibit fewer associated adverse reactions. In severe cases, blood exchange transfusions have been performed to lower the parasitic load in the individual. Other rudimentary treatment measures include addressing and correcting abnormal clinical signals.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} adverse effects involve {{a group of}} {{symptoms}} called cinchonism; almost everyone taking quinine has mild cinchonism , which can include headache, vasodilation and sweating, nausea, tinnitus, hearing impairment, vertigo or dizziness, blurred vision, and disturbance in color perception [...] More severe cinchonism includes vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, deafness, blindness, and disturbances in heart rhythms. [...] Cinchonism is much less common when quinine is given by mouth, but oral quinine is not well tolerated (quinine is exceedingly bitter and many patients will vomit after ingesting quinine tablets): Other drugs, such as Fansidar (sulfadoxine with pyrimethamine) or Malarone (proguanil with <b>atovaquone),</b> are often used when oral therapy is required. Quinine ethyl carbonate is tasteless and odourless, but is available commercially only in Japan. Blood glucose, electrolyte and cardiac monitoring are not necessary when quinine is given by mouth.|$|E
