40|$|A {{modified}} sink-float {{procedure to}} measure the density of tiny individual mineral particles A COMMON procedure for determining the den-sity of a small mineral particle is the heavy-liquid sink-float method. The procedure has been described in the literature, which has been ade-quately summarized by Muller 0977) - The sink-float method is quite straightforward for particles above o. ooi mm 3 (average dimension o. I mm), but problems arise when the particles are appreciably smaller than that. These problems include the difficulty of observing the mineral particle, dif-ficulty in recovering the particle, and anomalous particle movement due to convection currents in the heavy liquid. The procedure described here overcomes these difficulties to a large extent. The density determination is carried out using a small cell filled with heavy liquid and mounted in a temperature-controlled <b>air</b> <b>bath,</b> in the weighing chamber of an analytical balance. Sink-float behaviour of the small particles i observed using a stereomicroscope. Density calibration is achieved by use of a sealed mercury-in-glass plummet. Because the particles involved are not visible to the unaided eye, a stereomicroscope is mounted horizontally to enable {{the movement of the}} particle to be observed. The magnification used should initially be as low as possible so that a large field of view is obtained. To avoid having to shift the microscope up and down in searching for the particle, it is desirable to use as small a container as possible; a standard glass Io mm spectrophoto-metric ell, with a volume of about 3 ml, was found to be suitable. An added advantage of a small container is that it reduces thermal convection currents in the contained liquid. To control temperature, the cell is mounted in a perspex <b>air</b> <b>bath</b> with a thermocouple well next to the cell. The <b>air</b> <b>bath</b> is mounted on an adjustable-height bridge in the weighing chamber of an ana-lytical balance. A mercury-in-glass plummet on a stainless steel hook is used for the determination f the liquid density, when equilibrium has been achieved. The spectrophotometer c ll is charge...|$|E
