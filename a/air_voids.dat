It is defined as the formation of longitudinal depressions along the wheel paths caused by the progressive movement of materials under traffic loading in the asphalt pavement layers or in the underlying base through consolidation or plastic flow. This structural damage has a negative financial impact to the economy. In this study, the rutting behaviour of bituminous materials with different <b>air</b> <b>void</b> contents was investigated. The dynamic cyclic compression testing was carried out to establish nonlinear material models with multiple regression technique. With the specified material models, finite element analysis was carried out to study the rutting behaviour of the wearing course materials with different <b>air</b> <b>void</b> contents in a flexible pavement structure. The simulation result shows that the rutting depth is small at the <b>air</b> <b>void</b> contents of 4. 5 - 8 % for wearing course materials.
