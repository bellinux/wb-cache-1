50|$|A {{flue-gas}} stack {{is a type}} of chimney, {{a vertical}} pipe, channel or similar structure through which combustion product gases called flue gases are exhausted to the outside <b>air.</b> <b>Flue</b> gases are produced when coal, oil, natural gas, wood or any other fuel is combusted in an industrial furnace, a power plant's steam-generating boiler, or other large combustion device. Flue gas is usually composed of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor as well as nitrogen and excess oxygen remaining from the intake combustion air. It also contains a small percentage of pollutants such as particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. The flue gas stacks are often quite tall, up to 400 metres (1300 feet) or more, so as to disperse the exhaust pollutants over a greater area and thereby reduce the concentration of the pollutants to the levels required by governmental environmental policy and environmental regulation.|$|E
40|$|Ducts {{are closed}} path used for {{conveying}} <b>air,</b> <b>Flue</b> gas, Material, ash and etc from one system to another, {{in the power}} plant and in the industries. Ducts are routed to long distances, having abrupt change in direction and cross section which requires proper design for preventing the energy losses. Elbows are used for changing the direction of flow to 90 0. Due to this abrupt change, eddies, Recirculation zones are formed. These Eddies having energy gradients, which produces thrust and in turn Vibration to the duct wall. Eddies Should be broken by stream lining the flow before taking any branching from the main duct. But in some ducting system either in power plant or Industrial, due to constraints Elbow duct itself is to be branched out.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a {{substantial}} increase in energy demand due to industrialization development. This raises concern on issues such as depletion of fossil based energy and emission of green house gasses. Hence, optimization of energy use through the thermosyphon air preheater is one of the possible approaches to address this problem. It can be used to recover and transmit the heat from the hot <b>air</b> (<b>flue</b> gas) to the cold air used for combustion process in a boiler. This study focuses on the analytical analysis of the thermal performance of a thermosyphon operated with water and nanofluids. The thermo physical properties of the selected nanofluids and relevant formulations are taken from the literatures to perform the analysis. Study found that change of nanofluid properties such as thermal conductivity only plays minor role in enhancing the thermal performance of the thermosyphon. The study implied that the hot air velocity is capable of increasing the efficiency of a thermosyphon. It is found that 23 overall heat transfer enhancement is observed when the hot air velocity increases from 2. 0. m/s to 4. 75. m/s for water based (7) alumina and (4) titanium dioxide nanofluids...|$|E

40|$|During the {{development}} of the component-based energy system simulator DNA (Dynamic Network Analysis), several obstacles to easy use of the program have been observed. Some of these {{have to do with the}} nature of the program being based on a modelling language, not a graphical user interface (GUI). Others have to do with the interaction between models of the nature of the substances in an energy system (e. g., fuels, <b>air,</b> <b>flue</b> gas), models of the components in a system (e. g., heat exchangers, turbines, pumps), and the solver for the system of equations. This paper proposes that the interaction between models and solvers should be made more robust by making more robust component models which handle the exceptions of the equations inside them, instead of or in addition to trying to remedy these by adding features to the numerical solvers. Improving the robustness of a component model may be more or less difficult depending on the mathematical expressions creating the exceptions. The proposed idea suggests that the solvers may be helped by exception handling leading it back on the right track. The original equation of the model is substituted by an algorithm, so the original equation is only evaluated where it is defined. Outside this region an algorithm is introduced, so the model iterates back to the feasible region. It is shown how this can be done for four different model of energy system component models: turbine constant, gasifier, heat exchanger effectiveness, and heat exchanger heat transfer coefficient...|$|E

Even though the main objective of the power plant is to meet the increasing power demand at low cost, still it is behind the expectations due to low reliability of the power plant. Failures in the boiler side equipment have been considerably responsible for this with a huge financial loss to the country. This project studies the suitable designs for design faults and shortcomings of LVPS to improve {{the reliability of the}} power plant related to the boiler side. By analyzing the past data until the first overhaul of the power plant, it is revealed that the main failures are arisen in the primary air system, coal pulverizing system, secondary <b>air</b> and <b>flue</b> gas systems related to the boiler side. In addition to the low reliability of primary air system, it is not supplying the required total amount of primary air to the system to run the pulverizers within the safe margins. Installing a new primary air fan in the system not only meets the deficiency, but also improves the reliability. Failures related to the pitch controllers of forced draft fans and induced draft fans resulting to high vibrations and high bearing temperatures directly affect to the low reliability in the secondary <b>air</b> and <b>flue</b> gas system. Variable speed drivers to control the air flow instead of fan pitch controlling or inlet vane controlling methods are discussed in this paper. According to the past data of the plant, 53 % of failures arose in the pulverizing system have been recovered within ten hours.
