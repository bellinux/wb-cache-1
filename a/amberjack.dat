5|$|S. iniae {{is highly}} {{pathogenic}} in freshwater, marine, and euryhaline fish, and is highly lethal: outbreaks {{may be associated}} with 30–50% mortality. It is, therefore, one of the foremost economically important pathogens in intensive aquaculture. In 1997, the global economic impact of S.iniae infection to the aquaculture industry was estimated at US$100million (one-tenth of which in the United States). As of 2007, infection had been reported in 27 species of fish, including tilapia (genus Oreochromis and Tilapia), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), Japanese <b>amberjack</b> (Seriola quinqueradiata), red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), and barramundi (Lates calcarifer, which can be an asymptomatic carrier). Common carp (Cyprinus carpio), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), and goldfish (Carassius auratus) appear to be resistant. Fish raised in intensive aquaculture operations and subject to environmental stressors (i.e. suboptimal temperature, poor water quality, crowding, handling, etc.) are most prone to S.iniae infection. Wild fish populations located both near and far from aquaculture operations have also proven susceptible to S.iniae infection.|$|E

25|$|Blue runner is also of high {{importance}} to recreational fisheries, with anglers often taking the species both {{for food and}} to use as bait. The blue runner {{has a reputation as}} an excellent gamefish on light tackle, taking both fish baits, as well a variety of lures including hard-bodied bibbed lures, spoons, metal jigs and soft plastic jigs. The species is also a target for light tackle saltwater fly fishermen, and can push 6-weight fly tackle to its limits. The blue runner is used extensively as live bait for larger fish, including billfish, cobia and <b>amberjack.</b> It is considered a fairly low-quality table fish, and larger specimens are known to carry the ciguatera toxin in their flesh, with several cases reported from the Virgin Islands.|$|E
25|$|The {{rainbow runner}} {{is the only}} species in the {{monotypic}} genus Elagatis, {{which is one of}} thirty genera in the jack family, Carangidae. The Carangidae are Perciform fishes in the suborder Percoidei. The species was first scientifically described in 1825 by French zoologists Jean René Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard based on the type specimen collected from the Indian Ocean, somewhere in the Malay Archipelago. They named the species Seriola bipinnulata, believing the species was related to the amberjacks. This was later revised to the genus Seriolichthys by Bleeker before it was concluded the species warranted a new genus. The genus Micropteryx was initially created, but was already in use in the Lepidoptera. In 1840, Frederick Debell Bennett created the genus Elagatis, taken from a name published in a whaling voyage memoir, which he used in combination with the species name of bipinnulatus, which was deemed to be incorrect as the genus name is feminine and the original spelling of bipinnulata was reinstated. Phylogenetically, the species is most closely related to the <b>amberjack</b> genus, Seriola, being the most basal member identified of the carangid subfamily Naucratini. This has been determined by the sequencing of the mitochondrial cytochrome b genome, as well as older morphological studies.|$|E
25|$|Predatory pelagic fishes {{found on}} {{continental}} shelves worldwide in both tropical and temperate waters include porgies, barracuda, <b>amberjacks</b> and cutlassfishes.

Some species also feed on crabs and other invertebrates, foraged from the sea floor.|$|R
50|$|The hardyhead {{silversides}} is {{an important}} forage fish for larger fish species such as sharks, tunas, needlefish and <b>amberjacks</b> which capture them by associating with and attacking the day schools. They are also preyed on by sea birds such as terns, boobies, gulls, egrets and herons.

2500|$|In October 2013, Al Jazeera {{reported}} that the gulf ecosystem was [...] "in crisis", citing a decline in seafood catches, as well as deformities and lesions found in fish. In Louisiana, 4.6 million pounds of oily material {{was removed from the}} beaches in 2013, over double the amount collected in 2012. Oil cleanup crews worked four days a week on 55 miles of Louisiana shoreline throughout 2013. Oil continued to be found as far from the Macondo site as the Florida panhandle, where scientists said the oil and dispersant mixture is embedded in the sand. Researchers looking at sediment, seawater, biota, and seafood found toxic compounds in high concentrations that they said was due to the added oil and dispersants. Although Gulf fisheries recovered in 2011, a 2014 study {{of the effects of the}} oil spill on bluefin tuna by researchers at Stanford University and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, published in the journal Science, found that toxins released by the oil spill sent fish into cardiac arrest. The study found that even very low concentrations of crude oil can slow the pace of fish heartbeats. BP disputed the study, which was conducted as part of the federal Natural Resource Damage Assessment process required by the Oil Pollution Act. The study also found that oil already broken down by wave action and chemical dispersants was more toxic than fresh oil. Another peer-reviewed study, released in March 2014 and conducted by 17 scientists from the United States and Australia and published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that tuna and <b>amberjack</b> that were exposed to oil from the spill developed deformities of the heart and other organs.

6000|$|The {{sailfish}} {{were still}} leaping {{around us and}} we started off again. The captain called our attention to a tail and a sail a few yards apart {{not far from the}} boat. We circled around them to drive them down. I saw a big wave back of R. C.'s bait and I yelled, [...] "Look out!" [...] I felt something hit my bait and then hit it again. I knew it was a sailfish rapping at it. I let the line slip off the reel. Just then R. C. had a vicious strike and when he hooked the fish the line snapped. He claimed that he had jerked too hard. This is the difficulty with light tackle--to strike hard, yet not break anything. I was standing up and leaning forward, letting my line slip off the reel, trying to coax that sailfish to come back. Something took hold and almost jerked the rod out of my hands. That was a magnificent strike, and of course I thought {{it was one of the}} sailfish. But when I hooked him I had my doubts. The weight was heavy and ponderous and tugging. He went down and down and down. The boatman said <b>amberjack.</b> I was afraid so, but I still had my hopes. For a while I could not budge him, and at last, when I had given up hope that it was a sailfish, I worked a good deal harder than I would have otherwise. It took me twenty-five minutes to subdue a forty-pound <b>amberjack.</b> Here was proof of what could be done with light tackle.|$|E
25|$|Jacks, <b>amberjacks,</b> pompanos, horse mackerel, scads, leatherjackets and {{trevally}} are fish of {{the family}} Carangidae. Found in most coastal waters, they are fast predatory fishes that hunt in the waters above reefs and in the open sea; some dig in the sea floor for invertebrates (some can also filter feed, such as the white trevally). The largest fish in the family, the giant trevally, grows up to 1.7m in length; most fish in the family reach a maximum length of 25–100cm. The family contains many important commercial and game fish, notably the Pacific jack mackerel and the other jack mackerels in the genus Trachurus. The type species of this genus is the Atlantic horse mackerel. Jack mackerels are an important inshore commercial species.|$|R
40|$|From 1994 to 2002, 80 lesser <b>amberjacks,</b> Seriola fasciata (Bloch, 1793), {{were caught}} in Sicilian waters.

Juvenile specimens were observed under fish aggregating devices (FADs) located in Sardinia and Sicily during surveys carried out between 2001 and 2002. This species was previously recorded in the Mediterranean Sea as rare and considered a new Atlantic immigrant but the frequent catches and the continuous observations under FADs lead us to suppose {{that it is not}} as sporadic as the literature reports. The analysis of 14 stomach contents suggests S. fasciata to be an active predator of fish and crustaceans. The high frequency of records over the years, the large range of sizes recorded and the wide Mediterranean distribution of S. fasciata, suggests the establishment of a stable population in Sicilian seas {{as well as in the}} western Mediterranean.

6000|$|A {{word about}} Avalon boatmen. They are a fine body of men. I have heard them maligned. Certainly they have petty rivalries and jealousies, {{but this is}} not their fault. They fish all the seasons around and have been there for years. Boatmen at Long Key and other Florida resorts--at Tampico, Aransas Pass--are not in the same class with the Avalon men. They want to please and to excel, and to number you among their patrons for the future. And the boats--nowhere are there such splendid boats. Captain Danielson's boat had utterly spoiled me for fishing out of any other. He had it built, and the ideas of its {{construction}} were a product of fifteen years' study. It is thirty-eight feet long, and wide, with roomy, shaded cockpit and cabin, and comfortable revolving chairs to fish from. These chairs have moving sockets into which you can jam the butt of your rod; and the backs can be removed in a flash. Then you can haul at a fish! The boat lies deep, with heavy ballast in the stern. It has a keel all the way, and an enormous rudder. Both are constructed so your line can slip under the boat without fouling. It is equipped with sail and a powerful engine. Danielson can turn this boat, going at full speed, in its own length! Consider the merit of this when a tuna strikes, or a swordfish starts for the open sea. How many tarpon, barracuda, <b>amberjack,</b> and tuna I have lost on the Atlantic seaboard just because the boat could not be turned in time! ...|$|E
60|$|At Long Key the Gulf Stream is {{offshore}} five miles. The water shoals gradually {{anywhere from}} two feet near {{the beach to}} twenty feet five miles out on the reef. When {{there has been no}} wind for several days, which is a rare thing for Long Key, the water becomes crystal clear and the fish and marine creatures are an endless source of interest to the fisherman. Of course a large boat, in going out on the reef, must use the channel between the keys, but a small boat or canoe can go anywhere. It is remarkable how the great game fish come in from the Stream across the reef into shoal water. Barracuda come right up to the shore, and likewise the big sharks. The bottom is a clean, white, finely ribbed coral sand, with patches of brown seaweed here and there and golden spots, and in the shallower water different kinds of sponges. Out on the reef the water is a light green. The Gulf Stream runs along {{the outer edge of the}} reef, and here between Tennessee Buoy and Alligator Light, eighteen miles, is a feeding-ground for sailfish, kingfish, <b>amberjack,</b> barracuda, and other fishes. The ballyhoo is the main feed of these fishes, and it is indeed a queer little fish. He was made by nature, like the sardine and mullet and flying-fish, to serve as food for the larger fishes. The ballyhoo is about a foot long, slim and flat, shiny and white on the sides and dark green on the back, with a sharp-pointed, bright-yellow tail, the lower lobe of which is developed to twice the length of the upper. He has a very strange feature in the fact that his lower jaw resembles the bill of a snipe, being several inches long, sharp and pointed and hard; but he has no upper lip or beak at all. This half-bill must be used in relation to his food, but I do not have any idea how this is done.|$|E

40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} and applied for monitoring two types of fast-start locomotion (feeding and escape) of a cruiser fish, Japanese <b>amberjacks</b> Seriola quinqueradiata. A data logger, which incorporated a 3 -axis gyroscope, a 3 -axis accelerometer and a 3 -axis magnetometer, {{was attached to the}} five fish. The escape, feeding and routine movements of the fish, which were triggered in tank experiments, were then recorded by the data logger and video cameras. The locomotor variables, calculated based on the high resolution measurements by the data logger (500 Hz), were investigated to accurately detect and classify the types of fast-track behaviour. The results show that fast-start locomotion can be detected with a high precision (0. 97) and recall rate (0. 96) from the routine movements. Two types of fast-start movements were classified with high accuracy (0. 84). Accuracy was greater if the data were obtained from the data logger, which combined an accelerometer, a gyroscope and a magnetometer, than if only an accelerometer (0. 80) or a gyroscope (0. 66) was used...|$|R

The relative index of reef-fish abundance resulting from these annual Gulf-wide surveys is based on counts of fish recorded during a 1 h set of a video camera on the bottom. During the 1993 reef-fish survey, a total of 115 reef sites were sampled with a video camera and fisheries acoustic system. Video data were used to identify fish species distributed above the bottom. OV-bottom fish included snappers (Lutjanidae), groupers (Serranidae), and <b>amberjacks</b> (Seriola spp.), species of interest to commercial and recreational fisheries. Correlation between total oV-bottom taxa abundance and volume backscatter was low (r= 0. 41, n= 115).
