The crusaders represented northern and southern France, Flanders, Germany, and southern Italy, and so were divided into four separate armies that were not always cooperative, though they were held together by their common ultimate goal.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 This {{research}} {{investigates the}} experiences <b>of</b> female <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> {{gay men and}} lesbians. A naturalistic and grounded theory paradigm is employed in this qualitative study. The participants are five female <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> {{gay men and lesbians}} from the Southeastern region of the United States. The participants share their experiences as <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> gay men and lesbians during two in-depth interviews.

Findings reveal the following themes: (1) Way of Being; (2) Awareness; (3) Commitment; and (4) Integration. This study has implications for female <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> gay men and lesbians, and further implications for prejudice reduction and social justice...|$|R

5|$|Eowa {{was killed}} at Maserfield along with Oswald, {{although}} on which side he fought is unknown. It {{may well be}} that he fought as a dependent <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> Oswald against Penda. If Eowa was in fact dominant among the Mercians during the period leading up to the battle, then his death could have marked what the author of the Historia Brittonum regarded as the beginning of Penda's ten-year reign. Thus it may be that Penda prevailed not only over the Northumbrians but also over his rivals among the Mercians.|$|E
