5|$|On {{the morning}} of 12 May General Winkelman {{remained}} moderately optimistic.

5|$|A {{traditional}} {{thesis is}} that cavalry <b>assumed</b> <b>a</b> much greater {{importance in the}} 4th-century army than it enjoyed in the 2nd century. According to this view, cavalry increased significantly {{as a proportion of}} the total forces and took over the leading tactical role from the infantry. It also enjoyed much higher status than in the 2nd century. At the same time, the infantry declined in efficiency and value in operations, leaving the cavalry as the effective arm. In fact, there is no good evidence to support this view, and plenty of evidence against it.|$|E
3000|$|The {{main issue}} is how {{household}} decisions are made. Following, among others, Browning et al. (2010), we <b>assume</b> <b>a</b> non-cooperative setting and <b>assume</b> <b>a</b> Nash equilibrium is attained. A Nash equilibrium is defined as follows: [...]...|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, Mejia et al. <b>assume</b> <b>a</b> two-exponential decay for {{lung and}} liver TAC and a five-exponential decay for brain TAC {{that can be}} applied to {{experimental}} tissue data, respectively [11]. In comparison, the present study <b>assumes</b> <b>a</b> multi-exponential decay of the tracer IF leading to an analytical expression for integrated activity (Equation  4) that involves the sum ‘Σ(λCi/αi)’, which is the AUC of the tracer IF. This sum is close to the sum expressed in the right hand side of Equation A 4 obtained by Mejia [11], thus suggesting that for integrated activity estimation, <b>assuming</b> <b>a</b> multi-exponential decay of the tissue TAC should be implicitly connected to <b>assuming</b> <b>a</b> multi-exponential decay of the tracer IF.|$|R

5|$|Adams did {{not speak}} French, the {{international}} language of diplomacy at the time. He therefore <b>assumed</b> <b>a</b> less visible role, but emerged as the commission's chief administrator, imposing order and methods lacking in his delegation's finances and record-keeping affairs. His first stay in Europe, between April 1, 1778, and June 17, 1779, was otherwise unremarkable, and {{he returned to his}} home in Braintree in early August 1779. Back home, Adams became one of the founders and charter members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780.|$|E
5|$|As a {{reflection}} of categories of sexuality so sharply defined {{by the government and}} society at large, lesbian subculture developed extremely rigid gender roles between women, particularly among the working class in the U.S. and Canada. Although many municipalities had enacted laws against cross-dressing, some women would socialize in bars as butches: dressed in men's clothing and mirroring traditional masculine behavior. Others wore traditionally feminine clothing and <b>assumed</b> <b>a</b> more diminutive role as femmes. Butch and femme modes of socialization were so integral within lesbian bars that women who refused to choose between the two would be ignored, or at least unable to date anyone, and butch women becoming romantically involved with other butch women or femmes with other femmes was unacceptable.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{domestic}} opposition, internal demoralization, and international hostility, Gaddafi <b>assumed</b> <b>a</b> more conciliatory attitude following his defeat. On the other side, Habré also found himself vulnerable, as the French {{feared that the}} attack on Maatan as-Sarrah was only {{the first stage of}} a general offensive into Libya proper, a possibility that France was not disposed to tolerate. As a result, Mitterrand forced Habré to accept the mediation efforts of the Organization of African Unity's Zambian Chairman, Kenneth Kaunda, which resulted in a ceasefire on September 11.|$|E

40|$|Background: This article {{presents}} cohort studies that use {{data from the}} National Health Information Survey from 1986 to 1994 and compares the effectiveness of Cox proportional hazards models that <b>assume</b> <b>a</b> linear relationship between body mass index (BMI) {{and the risk of}} prostate cancer with models that <b>assume</b> <b>a</b> J-shaped relationship. Methods and results: Our study found that for black males over 40 years of age, neither a linear nor a J-shaped relationship yielded a statistically significant model. With white males over 40 years, <b>assuming</b> <b>a</b> linear relationship did not yield a statistically significant model (P = 0. 582). When we <b>assume</b> <b>a</b> J-shaped relationship, the optimal change point where the risk of prostate cancer death is minimized occurs when the BMI is 25. 5. Among white males over 40 years with BMI 3 ̆c 25. 5, an inverse relationship was found (P = 0. 009). Among white males over 40 years with BMI 3 ̆e 25. 5, a direct relationship was found (P = 0. 017). Conclusion: With this data set, we found that for white males over 40 years, Cox proportional hazards models that <b>assume</b> <b>a</b> J-shaped relationship between BMI and prostate cancer death provide a much better fit than models <b>assuming</b> <b>a</b> linear relationship...|$|R
5|$|Beginning in July 1940, the Red Army General Staff {{developed}} war {{plans that}} identified the Wehrmacht {{as the most}} dangerous threat to the Soviet Union, {{and that in the}} case of a war with Germany, the Wehrmacht's main attack would come through the region north of the Pripyat Marshes into Belorussia, which later proved to be correct. Stalin disagreed, and in October he authorized the development of new plans that <b>assumed</b> <b>a</b> German attack would focus on the region south of Pripyat Marshes towards the economically vital regions in Ukraine. This became the basis for all subsequent Soviet war plans and the deployment of their armed forces in preparation for the German invasion.|$|E
5|$|Cannae {{played a}} major role in shaping the {{military}} structure and tactical organization of the Roman Republican army. At Cannae, the Roman infantry <b>assumed</b> <b>a</b> formation similar to the Greek phalanx. This left them vulnerable to Hannibal's tactic of double envelopment since their inability to maneuver independently from the mass of the army made it impossible for them to counter the strategic encirclement used by the Carthaginian cavalry. The laws of the Roman state requiring command to alternate between the two consuls restricted strategic consistency.|$|E
5|$|Commissioned in the Royal Australian Air Force during 1921, Brownell {{had risen}} {{to the rank of}} group captain by the {{beginning}} of the Second World War. Establishing the Royal Australian Air Force base in Singapore, he returned to Australia in 1941 as an air commodore and was appointed to lead No. 1 Training Group. He was Air Officer Commanding Western Area from January 1943 until July 1945, when he took charge of the recently formed No.11 Group on Morotai. Retiring from the Air Force in 1947, Brownell <b>assumed</b> <b>a</b> partnership in a stockbroking firm. He died in 1974 at the age of 79; his autobiography, From Khaki to Blue, was published posthumously.|$|E

5|$|Further {{intensification}} was slowed {{because of}} strong wind shear, which caused the storm's center of circulation to be displaced from {{the bulk of}} convection. Due {{to the lack of}} atmospheric steering currents at the time, Odile <b>assumed</b> <b>a</b> slow, meandering course towards the west. Continued wind shear caused the tropical storm to become disorganized on September11 before abating, allowing for thunderstorms to rebuild over Odile's circulation center on September12. The relaxed wind shear enabled the growth of intense rainbands encircling the tropical cyclone as well as improved outflow aloft. The following day, Odile quickly attained a large central dense overcast; in accordance with Dvorak-derived satellite intensity estimates, the NHC upgraded the storm to hurricane intensity.|$|E
5|$|Greek life at UVA began a {{few decades}} after the school's {{establishment}} in 1819. Before this time social life at the university was fixed around debating societies; the now-defunct Patrick Henry Society, for instance, initially had a membership nearly equal {{to the size of}} the student body. In the 1850s the first fraternities began to appear and <b>assumed</b> <b>a</b> significant role in the student body's social landscape. In the following decades, the university became the birthplace of two national fraternities and saw many more fraternity chapters chartered. The twentieth century saw the system expand even more to include professional fraternities, social sororities, local fraternities, and black fraternities and sororities. Moving into the 2000s, several new social Greek organizations were founded, and multicultural organizations began to rise to prominence.|$|E
5|$|Grenier {{directed}} his well-managed retreat {{along the road}} toward Haag, with all the units falling back in an orderly echelon. To save some artillery from capture, the 2nd Dragoons charged their pursuers and captured 100 Austrians. After falling back , the French soldiers reached the open ground around Haag, where they <b>assumed</b> <b>a</b> defensive position. All told, the battle lasted six hours. In addition to the Latour Dragoons, the most heavily engaged Austrian units were the Archduke Charles Infantry Regiment (IR) # 3 and the Waldeck Dragoons # 7 from Riesch's column, plus IR # 60 and the Vecsey Hussars # 4 from Johann Kollowrat's column.|$|E

5|$|Haldane's {{hypothesis}} {{was that a}} diver could ascend immediately to a depth where the supersaturation reaches but does not exceed the critical supersaturation level, at which depth the pressure gradient for off-gassing is maximized and the decompression is most efficient. The diver would remain at this depth until saturation had reduced sufficiently for him to ascend another 10 feet, to the new depth of critical supersaturation, where the process would be repeated until it was safe for the diver to reach the surface. Haldane <b>assumed</b> <b>a</b> constant critical ratio of dissolved nitrogen pressure to ambient pressure which was invariant with depth.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, Captain Lyman Hall was {{appointed}} Georgia Tech's first mathematics professor (and consequently {{head of the}} school's mathematics department). He had a solid background in engineering due to his time at West Point and often incorporated surveying and other engineering applications into his coursework. He had an energetic personality and quickly <b>assumed</b> <b>a</b> leadership position among the faculty. At the first faculty meeting on October 5, 1888, he was elected secretary. On June 25, 1895, Professor Hall was invited to speak to Georgia Tech's board about the school's needs. While there were no recorded minutes, subsequent board actions suggest that he recommended the construction of on-campus dormitories to reduce disciplinary problems, and a more proactive recruitment of students.|$|E
