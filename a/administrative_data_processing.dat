40|$|A {{critical}} component {{that has been}} missing from the e-governance literature in general is theorising about {{the design of the}} information system itself. Since information systems used by governments “encapsulate the structures, routines, norms, and values implicit in the rich contexts within which they are embedded, ” [1] they must been seen as a development project shaped by social (key stakeholders, conflicts, power moves, symbolic acts, etc.) and technological factors (existing technology infrastructures, technical know-how, skills). The development trajectory of such a project is not pre-determined but contingent upon broad social contexts. To highlight the dynamic relationship between the way in which information systems used by governments are designed, {{the manner in which they}} are institutionalised and the impact of these two processes on governance practices and structures, I present a theoretical framework that combines social shaping of technology theories (from science and technology studies) and institutional theory (from sociology) and social movement theory.

40|$|Abstract Background Secondary use {{of large}} scale <b>administrative</b> <b>data</b> is {{increasingly}} popular in {{health services and}} clinical research, where a user-friendly tool for data management is in great demand. MapReduce technology such as Hadoop is a promising tool for this purpose, though its use has been limited {{by the lack of}} user-friendly functions for transforming large scale data into wide table format, where each subject is represented by one row, for use in health services and clinical research. Since the original specification of Pig provides very few functions for column field management, we have developed a novel system called GroupFilterFormat to handle the definition of field and data content based on a Pig Latin script. We have also developed, as an open-source project, several user-defined functions to transform the table format using GroupFilterFormat and to deal with processing that considers date conditions. Results Having prepared dummy discharge summary data for 2. 3 million inpatients and medical activity log data for 950 million events, we used the Elastic Compute Cloud environment provided by Amazon Inc. to execute processing speed and scaling benchmarks. In the speed benchmark test, the response time was significantly reduced and a linear relationship was observed between the quantity of <b>data</b> and <b>processing</b> time in both a small and a very large dataset. The scaling benchmark test showed clear scalability. In our system, doubling the number of nodes resulted in a 47 % decrease in processing time. Conclusions Our newly developed system is widely accessible as an open resource. This system is very simple and easy to use for researchers who are accustomed to using declarative command syntax for commercial statistical software and Structured Query Language. Although our system needs further sophistication to allow more flexibility in scripts and to improve efficiency in <b>data</b> <b>processing,</b> it shows promise in facilitating the application of MapReduce technology to efficient <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> with large scale <b>administrative</b> <b>data</b> in health services and clinical research. </p...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study is to determine the agreement between <b>administrative</b> <b>data</b> sources and chart audit for the identification of stroke type, stroke risk factors, and the use of hospital-based diagnostic procedures in patients with stroke or TIA. Methods: Medical charts for a population-based sample of patients (n = 14, 508) with ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), or TIA discharged from inpatient and emergency departments (ED) in Ontario, Canada, between April 1, 2012 and March 31, 2013, were audited by trained abstractors. Audited data were linked and compared with hospital <b>administrative</b> <b>data</b> and physician billing data. The positive predictive value (PPV) of hospital <b>administrative</b> <b>data</b> and kappa agreement for the reporting of stroke type were calculated. Kappa agreement was also determined for stroke risk factors and for select stroke-related procedures. Results: The PPV for stroke type in inpatient <b>administrative</b> <b>data</b> ranged from 89. 5 % (95 % CI 88. 0 - 91. 0) for TIA, 91. 9 % (95 % CI 90. 2 - 93. 5) for ICH, and 97. 3 % (95 % CI 96. 9 - 97. 7) for ischemic stroke. For ED <b>administrative</b> <b>data,</b> PPV varied from 78. 8 % (95 % CI 76. 3 - 81. 2) for ischemic, 86. 3 % (95 % CI 76. 8 - 95. 7) for ICH, and 95. 3 % (95 % CI 94. 6 - 96. 0) for TIA. The chance-corrected agreement between the audited and <b>administrative</b> <b>data</b> was good for atrial fibrillation (k = 0. 60) and very good for diabetes (k = 0. 86).

Finally, some suggestions are made for manage-ment policies and procedures to insure that poten-tially high-risk projects receive the appropriate degree of attention before they are implemented. Keywords:Management of computing, <b>administrative</b> <b>data</b> <b>processing,</b> competitive information systems ACM Categories: K. 6, J. 1 The use of information systems to gain com-petitive advantage is surely one of the major business stories of the 1980 s. The news broke first in academic journals, then was picked up by the business and trade press. Managers can read about competitive uses of informa-tion systems (IS) in a Wide variety of publica-tions, hear about such applications in semi-nars, and hire consultants to search for them in the managers ’ own companies. A major hardware vendor is even rumored to be working on a videodisk version of the "IS for competi-tive advantage " story. The word is definitely out, {{and for the most part}} the news is good. The strategically important information sys-tems projects of the future are likely to be large, reflecting the growing complexity of thd general business environment. Winning projects will often be the first in an applica-tion area, giving developers little previous structure to draw on. Many, perhaps most, of these vital, innovative systems will be based on new technology. These three dimensions [...] large size, low structure, and new technolo-gy [...] all suggest that high risk will accom-pany the potentially huge payoffs from infor-mation systems. Warren McFarlan writes, "If we proceed, we will sometimes fail. " [1, p. 150]. In fact, he may be optimistic. As important as the risks of project failure are, however, there may be a more insidious danger lurking for would-be developers of stra-tegic information systems; not that a project will fail, but that it will succeed.

40|$|During {{the latest}} years, IT {{governance}} {{has become more}} and more important, for several reasons: the increasing pervasivity of IT in business organization, management and administration requires a veritable governance activity, to strategically orient decision making about IT investments and management; the role of information systems in <b>administrative</b> <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> requires a special focus on information security and process control; the need to keep down IT budget forces to balance IT capital expenditure and operational expenditure and to increase IT systems productivity and information value. More of the attention on IT Governance is captured by compliance, owing to the recent financial scandals and the severe rules regarding information systems audit and control. Companies need to comply with these rules, but it requires important investments, considered not strategic but only necessary (Remenyi et. Al. 2000). However, companies should analyse the compliance requirements and to implement an IT governance system, not only to comply with legal rules, but also to improve the strategic alignment between IT and business and to optimise value creation by IT compliance investments (Ventrakaman and Henderson 1996, Van Grembergen 2003). Therefore, IT governance should have a complex set of goals, such as: to standardize and unify processes; to align information delivery with business needs; to control IT initiatives cost; to comply with external requirements. These goals are often opposed and difficult to pursue, because: they regard cross functional enterprise systems; they are strictly linked; they concern large databases and applications, very difficult to control. To optimise IT compliance it is useful to define a roadmap to IT compliance, orienting these activity to value creation, by realising scale, scope and experience economies in IT compliance activities. The accomplishment of this roadmap is the automation of IT compliance processes, using Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) standard solutions or developing in house systems, such as Enterprise Information Management (EIM) systems, to automatically manage processes, data and information security, access control, system performance and to data usability. In this paper, IT compliance topic is introduced, to define how to orient IT compliance to value creation; GRC systems and EIM systems are described, with their different cost and benefits for companies. Aim of the paper is to define how to develop compliance automated systems, to save money and enhance information integration and value.

40|$|The {{prominent}} {{themes of}} the research are total domestic outsourcing {{and the role of}} the IT function. The latter has been an issue for researchers and practitioners since the early days of information systems. The role of IT has changed considerably over the years, from basic <b>administrative</b> <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> to the central focus of enabling strategic processes. The literature reveals the considerable changes that have taken place over the last 30 years in the role of the IT function. The IT department over the years has moved from a traditional manufacturing role, where the department would be involved in software development and maintenance, computer operations, and technical services, to a more services orientated role. In addition, IT outsourcing has grown over the past thirty years to become a major industry. It usually involves some transfer of assets and staff to the vendor. The concept of IT outsourcing has changed over the years from a tactical option for the IT function to, in some cases, a significant part of a long-term strategy to structure and manage organisations. As such, it has often had a considerable influence on the role of the IT function. Although much has been written about IT sourcing strategy, there is a gap in the literature regarding in-depth case studies of the impact of IT outsourcing on the IT function, seen within various levels of the organisation, from senior management down to operations, and everyday users. Similarly, there are few studies that consider IT outsourcing in the context of other competitive and industrial forces that are affecting the management and operation of large organisations. This research comprises a detailed case study of the implementation of large-scale domestic IT outsourcing within the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). It utilises Activity Theory as a lens to examine the implementation from the perspective of various stakeholder groups at different levels within the organisation in order to address the research question: “What is the influence of total domestic IT outsourcing on the role of the IT function?” The central contributions of the thesis are within the methodological and theoretical areas. The in-depth case study of a large organisation with a rich culture draws out interesting data, and the use of Activity Theory analyses the data in a novel way. The total domestic outsourcing affects not only the role of the IT function, but the entire organisation. It leads to huge transfers of staff and assets, restructures, redundancies and changes to everyday processe...|$|E

40|$|Many of {{the issues}} with using data from {{clinical}} trials and observational studies for economic evaluations are highlighted {{in the case of}} chemotherapy side effects. We present the results of an observational cohort study using linked <b>administrative</b> <b>data.</b> The chemotherapy side effects identified in the <b>administrative</b> <b>data</b> are compared with patient self-reports of such events. The results of these comparisons are then used to guide a discussion {{of the issues}} surrounding the use of <b>administrative</b> <b>data</b> to identify clinical events for the population of economic models. Although the advantages of easy access and generalizability of the results make <b>administrative</b> <b>data</b> an attractive option for populating economic models, this is not always possible because of the limitations of these data...|$|R
