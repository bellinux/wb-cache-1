5|$|In June 1872, G.M. Shoop, a {{businessman}} from Danville bought 28 {{acres of land}} on the site that would become the Mountain Grove Campground. He reported this purchase in a meeting held on June 20, 1872 in Columbia County {{with a group of}} Methodists, including several ministers. In this meeting, an executive committee was appointed to arrange the camp meeting. The executive committee included Reverend S. Creighton, Reverend S. Barnes (the chairman), H.E. Sutherland (the secretary), Reverend B.P. King, Reverend E.T. Schwartz, M. Hartman, J.W. Cleaver, J.W. Eyer, and G.M. Shoop himself. Shoop intended to give the land to a local camp meeting organization once one existed. This idea was well received by the district superintendent of the Methodist Church. A committee consisting of four pastors and five lay leaders was subsequently created for the camp meeting site. Craig Newton, <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>professor</b> at what would become the Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania, stated that the site purchased by Shoop would be an ideal location for a camp meeting site.|$|E

25|$|Based {{on these}} revelations, Texas <b>A</b> <b>history</b> <b>professor</b> Luke Nichter, who had {{successfully}} petitioned {{for the release}} of the information, argued that Woodward and Bernstein were incorrect in concluding, based largely on Watergate burglar James McCord's word, {{that the purpose of the}} break-in was to bug O'Brien's phone to gather political and financial intelligence on the Democrats. Instead, Nichter sided with late journalist J. Anthony Lukas of the New York Times, who had concluded that the committee was seeking to find evidence linking the Democrats to prostitution, as it was alleged that Oliver's office had been used to arrange such meetings. However, Nichter acknowledged that Woodward and Bernstein's theory of O'Brien as the target could not be debunked unless information was released about what Baldwin heard in his bugging of conversations.|$|E

500|$|Modern-day {{historians have}} {{continued}} to characterize the battle as a wholesale massacre.

Kerry A. Trask's 2007 work, Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America, points to the writings of Wakefield as evidence that delusional beliefs about doing brave deeds and magnifying manliness spurred the U.S. forces to revel in and pursue massacring and exterminating the Sauk and Fox. Trask concluded that Wakefield's statement [...] "I must confess, that it filled my heart with gratitude and joy, to think that I had been instrumental, with many others, in delivering my country of those merciless savages, and restoring those people again to their peaceful homes and firesides," [...] was a viewpoint held by nearly all militia members.|$|E

500|$|The Appaloosa {{came to the}} {{attention}} of the general public in January 1937 in Western Horseman magazine when Francis D.

Haines had performed extensive research, traveling with a friend and Appaloosa aficionado named George Hatley, visiting numerous Nez Perce villages, collecting history, and taking photographs. The article generated strong interest in the horse breed, and led to the founding of the Appaloosa Horse Club (ApHC) by Claude Thompson and a small group of other dedicated breeders in 1938. The registry was originally housed in Moro, Oregon; but in 1947 the organization moved to Moscow, Idaho, under the leadership of George Hatley. [...] The Appaloosa Museum foundation was formed in 1975 to preserve the history of the Appaloosa horse. The Western Horseman magazine, and particularly its longtime publisher, Dick Spencer, continued to support and promote the breed through many subsequent articles.|$|E
500|$|Roger Wilkins, <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>professor</b> at George Mason University {{who studies}} {{race in the}} United States, said [...] "Blood Ties" [...] {{provided}} [...] "insightful, wonderful explorations on the complexities of many levels of race." [...] He also said the show [...] "really does understand how we're all caught in this culture, and we're all struggling with it. And we all bring to this jagged enterprise the limited understanding of {{where we came from}} and who we are. Being fully alive requires us to struggle with these realities. That's what the show does." [...] In his journal article about the portrayal of African American men in Homicide: Life on the Street, documentary historian Thomas A. Mascaro said the presentation of light-skinned black villains like Luther Mahoney and dark-skinned actors like the one played by James Earl Jones in [...] "Blood Ties", [...] "dispels the notion that black skin color is uniform or determinative with regard to character". Some media outlets described the Watson subplot as a racial spin on the 1996 murder of six-year-old child beauty pageant queen JonBenét Ramsey, although Tom Fontana said any similarities were not intended.|$|E
500|$|The {{question}} of whether the Citizenship Clause applied to persons born in the United States to Chinese immigrants first came before the courts in an 1884 case, In re Look Tin Sing. [...] Look Tin Sing was born in Mendocino, California in 1870, but after returning from a trip to China in 1884, he was barred from reentering the United States by officials who objected to his not having met the documentation requirements imposed at the time on Chinese immigrants. [...] Look's case was heard in the federal circuit court for California by U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Stephen J. Field and two other federal judges. [...] Lucy Salyer, <b>a</b> <b>history</b> <b>professor</b> at the University of New Hampshire, writes that Justice Field [...] "issued an open invitation to all lawyers in the area to give their opinions on the constitutional questions involved" [...] in the case. [...] Field focused on the meaning of the subject to the jurisdiction thereof phrase of the Citizenship Clause, held that Look was indeed subject to U.S. jurisdiction {{at the time of his}} birth despite the alien status of his parents, and on this basis ordered U.S. officials to recognize Look as a citizen and allow him to enter the United States. [...] The Look Tin Sing ruling was not appealed and was never reviewed by the Supreme Court. A similar conclusion was reached by the federal circuit court for Oregon in the 1888 cases of Ex parte Chin King and Ex parte Chan San Hee.|$|E
