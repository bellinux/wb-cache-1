As has been observed in studies where shock is the aversive event, initial reactions to the pre-loss stimulus were transient increases in overall and stimulus rates. Unlike shock studies, continued training produced decreased rates, {{in the presence of}} the 15 -sec stimulus, which were maintained in two of three subjects. Subsequent observations indicated that lowered rates were a function of the subject's rate of avoidance responding, the duration of the stimulus, and the scheduling of <b>avoidable</b> <b>losses.</b> Increasing the duration of the stimulus eliminated lowered rates {{in the presence of the}} stimulus and subsequent exposures to conditions which previously produced lowered rates did not result in recovery of the phenomenon.

The highest population of larvae and pupae per cauliflower plant was recorded {{in the month of}} September in all areas whereas the lowest was measured during July in both years. The population dynamics was correlated with the weather parameters and it was found that there was statistically nonsignificant (P> 0. 05) associations with temperatures (maximum and minimum) whereas the interaction with the relative humidity (RH) was non-significant in Haripur (2012 & 2013) and Swat (2013) and significant in Peshawar (2012 & 2013) and Swat (2012). Rainfall (RF) had a negative and highly significant (P< 0. 01) association with the population of P. xylostella. Multiple Regressions displayed 87. 56 to 98. 06 % variability in population {{dynamics of}} P. xylostella in the studied areas due to weather parameters. To determine genetic variability among the populations of P. xylostella, 3 rd and 4 th instar larvae were collected from Haripur, Peshawar and Swat having distinct geographic conditions and altitudes and were investigated by using RAPD (DNA) primers technique. Seventeen primers were used that produced 64 bands at different loci within a range of between 250 to 1500 bp. The bands produced were all monomorphic and no polymorphisms were detected in the three populations. For the management of P. xylostella Lufenuron (5 % EC- 200 ml/Acre), Steward (15. 84 % EC 175 ml/Acre), Emamectine Benzoate (1. 9 % EC- 200 ml/Acre) and Arrivo (10 % EC 250 ml/Acre) pesticides were used in cauliflower. Lufenuron was found significantly more effective in terms of pest suppression, highest biological efficacy (B. E) and yield as well found safe for the parasitoids as compared to all other insecticides whereas Arrivo insecticide was found at par with the control. Similarly garlic, tomato, chilli and coriander were intercropped with cauliflower for two seasons to manage the infestation of P. xylostella. Garlic reduced the population significantly (P< 0. 01) as compared to other intercrops and likewise, the highest average yield, maximum percent gain over the control and <b>avoidable</b> <b>losses</b> per plot was obtained in cauliflower + garlic plots whereas the lowest yield (30. 16 Kg/ 40 plants), minimum percent gain (7. 56 %) and percent <b>avoidable</b> <b>losses</b> (7. 03 %) was attained from the cauliflower plots intercropped with the coriander. Synchronized study was conducted of the best insecticide (Lufenuron) and intercrop (garlic) obtained from the previous experiments against P. xylostella in cauliflower.

40|$|<b>Avoidable</b> <b>losses</b> and {{economic}} injury levels (EILs) {{were computed for}} the sorghum head bug, Calocoris angustatus Leth., on three cultivars during three rainy seasons (1985 – 1987) at ICRISAT. Grain yield in plots protected with 2 – 5 insecticide sprays (carbaryl at 500 g a. i. /ha) between the half-anthesis and the dough stage {{was significantly higher than}} in untreated plots, with cost-benefit ratios > 1. Plots that were not protected at half-anthesis and/or complete-anthesis, and at milk and dough stages, suffered a significant loss in yield. Bug damage spoiled the grain quality in terms of germination, 1000 -grain mass, grain hardness and percentage floaters. Three to four sprays between complete-anthesis and the dough stage prevented a significant reduction in grain quality. Head bug density at half-anthesis, complete-anthesis, milk and dough stages was significantly and negatively associated with grain yield. Bug density at different stages explained 43 – 94 % of the variance in yield. Direct effects of bug numbers at the milk stage and the indirect effects of head bug density at other stages through the milk stage contributed towards maximum reduction in yield. Maximum <b>avoidable</b> <b>losses</b> were recorded in cultivar ICSV 1 (88 · 6 %), followed by CSH 1 (69 · 9 %), and CSH 5 (53 · 9 % in 1986 and 55 · 0 % in 1987).

This paper quantifies food losses in Switzerland at the various stages of the food value chain (agricultural production, postharvest handling and trade, processing, food service industry, retail, and households), identifies hotspots and analyses the reasons for losses. Twenty-two food categories are modelled separately in a mass and energy flow analysis, {{based on data from}} 31 companies within the food value chain, and from public institutions, associations, and from the literature. The energy balance shows that 48 % of the total calories produced (edible crop yields at harvest time and animal products, including slaughter waste) is lost across the whole food value chain. Half of these losses would be avoidable given appropriate mitigation measures.

40|$|There are {{numerous}} theoretical approaches to estimating the {{power conversion efficiency}} (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs), ranging from the empirical approach to calculations based on general considerations of thermodynamics. Depending {{on the level of}} abstraction and model assumptions, the accuracy of PCE estimation and complexity of the calculation can change dramatically. In particular, PCE estimation with a drift-diffusion approach (widely investigated in the literature), strongly depends on the assumptions made for the physical models and optoelectrical properties of semiconducting materials. This has led to a huge deviation as well as complications in the analysis of simulated results aiming to understand the factors limiting the performance of OSCs. In this work, we intend to highlight the complex relation between mobility, exciton dynamics, nanoscale dimension, and loss mechanisms in one framework. Our systematic analysis represents key information on the sensitivity of the drift-diffusion approach, to estimate how physical parameters and physical processes bind the PCE of the device under the influence of structure, contact, and material layer properties.

40|$|ABSTRACT: It is most {{important}} to the design-quality of grid connected PV-systems, to find the optimum number of given serial connected modules feeding the inverter. Often, today’s system design procedures do not fully take the input voltage for optimum inverter efficiency into account, thus causing <b>avoidable</b> <b>losses</b> of up to 3 %. First, the question is answered, what are the operating DC-voltage and-power ranges for existing grid-connected plants over a whole year. The data is analysed in a surface-plot, which expresses the cumulative frequency curve of a certain energy output for certain intervals of voltage and power. Different characteristics are found e. g., between roof top systems and façade applications. Moreover, a non-optimum system design, caused by wrong numbers of serial connected modules, {{can be found in}} analysing the DC operating area’s “footprint ” in these plots. In such a case the distribution is located at the lower or higher MPP voltage limit of the inverter. Thus the manufactures of inverters are recommended to generally show the efficiency values of their products at relevant DC voltage ranges in their datasheets. It would also be helpful for increasing overall PV system efficiency, to include such information in their public system design software, which is widely used in practice. On the basis of the analysed in-field data, a possible refinement of the widely used EURO-efficiency definition for inverters, including voltage parameters is suggested...|$|E

Global warming and energy crisis {{are among the}} most important issues that threaten the peaceful existence of the man-kind.

The energy balance analysis gives useful information on the distribution of supplied fuel energy in the engine systems and identifies the <b>avoidable</b> <b>losses</b> of the real engine process with respect to ideal process. It is a very widely used tool, mostly used for the layout of the engine components. The basic energy balance theory has been discussed in details along with the variations in energy balance approaches and terms.

There are some significant variations observed in energy balance when the engine operating fuel is changed and devices like turbocharger, supercharger etc. are used to boost the intake air pressure.
