500|$|In 1923 the {{composer}} Frederic Austin wrote the opera Polly, closely {{based on the}} 1729 work {{of the same name}} by John Gay and Johann Christoph Pepusch; recordings of Austin's work were published by Columbia's main rival, the Gramophone Company. At Columbia's request Ketèlbey produced his own version of Gay's original. Austin considered that it copied elements of his, and sued for copyright infringement. Acting as a court expert witness, {{the composer}} Sir Frederick Bridge thought that the case [...] "...is an awful bore.... These two good men are good musicians, and they have no business to be fighting over the game. It is not worth the trouble.... It is rubbish. I <b>am</b> <b>sick</b> of Polly." [...] After three weeks the case ended with the judge finding against Columbia.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the last}} game of the World Series had been played, rumors spread that Detroit (which had amassed an all-star lineup with a {{commensurate}} payroll) was in negotiations to unload Dunlap's high salary by selling him to Pittsburgh. Dunlap announced in November 1887 {{that he would not}} consent unless the Detroit club paid him half of the sum it was to receive from Pittsburgh to secure his release. He said at the time, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>sick</b> and tired of being sold without gaining anything by it, and it is about time that my bank account was benefited by these transfers." [...] He told a reporter for The New York Times that he was not penniless and would refuse to play unless his demands were met. He told the reporter that the Detroit club had three choices -- [...] "give me half of the money secured for my release, allow me to go where I please, or fulfill the contract made with me last year." ...|$|E
500|$|Holmes's {{academic}} {{interests and}} hobbies were divided among law, medicine, and writing. He {{was elected to}} the Hasty Pudding, where he served as Poet and Secretary, and to the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. With two friends, he collaborated on a small book entitled Poetical Illustrations of the Athenaeum Gallery of Painting, which was a collection of satirical poems about the new art gallery in Boston. He was asked to provide an original work for his graduating class's commencement and wrote a [...] "light and sarcastic" [...] poem that met with great acclaim. Following graduation, Holmes intended to go into the legal profession, so he lived at home and studied at the Harvard Law School (named Dane School at the time). By January 1830, however, he was disenchanted with legal studies. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>sick</b> at heart of this place and almost everything connected to it", he wrote. [...] "I know not what the temple of law may be to those who have entered it, but to me it seems very cold and cheerless about the threshold." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} shot over seven {{days with a}} budget of about $68,000. Both Roger and Gene Corman were present {{for most of the}} film's {{production}} and involved creatively as well as financially. Gene was more involved with running the day-to-day operations while the more experienced Roger Corman supervised and provided guidance to both Gene and Kowalski. Martin Varno was also present for shooting. They operated out of the Charlie Chaplin Studios, which was called Kling Studios at the time. Some rewriting was done as the filming progressed, and director Bernard L. Kowalski called it a collaborative process that involved himself, the Cormans and the whole crew. Varno, however, said he was not happy with how the filming process went, and that the Cormans changed dialogue and story elements without his consultation or permission. He said it reached the point where he called his agent and said, [...] "I am not working for these sons of bitches any more! I <b>am</b> <b>sick</b> and tired of the whole thing!" ...|$|E
500|$|Friday {{was marked}} {{during the game}} by Mark Lawrenson, who so {{frustrated}} the Cardiff forward with his close attention that Friday waited for Lawrenson to attempt a slide tackle and then {{kicked him in the}} face. After receiving a red card, Friday left the ground with the game still going on; according to legend, before leaving he broke into the Brighton dressing room and defecated in Lawrenson's kit bag. Cardiff eventually lost 4–0. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>sick</b> and tired of it", Andrews told the South Wales Echo on 1 November. [...] "To be sent off in his first game back is as much as a man can stand". Friday was transfer-listed and served a three-match suspension before making his final appearance on 10 December in Cardiff's 6–3 away defeat against Bolton. Liza was by now the mother of Friday's second daughter, Arabella, but around this time began divorce proceedings. Friday claimed that he had had enough of people telling him what to do, and walked into Andrews's office on 20 December 1977 to announce that he was retiring from professional football. The club promptly released him and cancelled his contract.|$|E
500|$|With Miranda {{imprisoned in}} Spain, Bolívar {{emerged as the}} new leader of the Venezuelan {{independence}} movement. He resolved {{that they would have}} to take some time to prepare before returning to the mainland. Growing bored in Curaçao, MacGregor decided to offer his services to General Antonio Nariño's republican armies in Venezuela's western neighbour, New Granada. He escorted Josefa to lodgings in Jamaica, then travelled to Nariño's base at Tunja in the eastern Andes. Miranda's name won the Scotsman a fresh commission in the service of New Granada, with command of 1,200 men in the Socorro district near the border with Venezuela. There was little action in this sector; Nariño's forces were mainly engaged around Popayán in the south-west, where the Spanish had a large garrison. Rafter reports positively on MacGregor's conduct in Socorro, writing that [...] "by the introduction of the European system of tactics, [...] considerably improved the discipline of the troops", but some under his command disliked him. An official in Cúcuta, the district capital, expressed utter contempt for MacGregor in a letter to a friend: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>sick</b> and tired of this bluffer, or Quixote, or the devil knows what. This man can hardly serve us in New Granada without heaping ten thousand embarrassments upon us." ...|$|E

He commented, [...] "I too <b>am</b> <b>sick</b> of the Israelis. [...] I'm sick of having a great power like the US being dictated to."

We say to you: stand and deliver!". He then attacked violent films and urged tougher prison conditions to prevent criminals from re-offending. He criticised the role of [...] "do-gooders" [...] and finished off the speech by denouncing the opposition party's law and order policies. This was a time when Archer was actively seeking another front-line political role.|$|E

2500|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the enemy's retreat, the Wei general Zhuge Dan ordered his subordinate Jiang Ban (蔣班) to lead 4,000 troops to pursue and attack Liu Zan. As Liu Zan was ill at the time, {{he could not get}} up and direct the troops to fight the enemy. Knowing that they would lose the battle, he passed his ceremonial umbrella and his official seal to his subordinate(s) and told him, [...] "As a commander, I have defeated enemies and captured their flags, but I have never lost a single battle. Now, I <b>am</b> <b>sick</b> and outnumbered by the enemy. You should quickly leave while you still can. It won't do our State any good if all of us die here today; it'll only benefit the enemy." [...] When his subordinate(s) refused to leave, he drew his sword and threatened to kill him; only then did his subordinate(s) leave.|$|E
2500|$|During one of {{the many}} festivals that would take place in the city, the people would gather in their temple and place offerings of food before their idols. Ur's most {{prominent}} temple is the Great Ziggurat, which can be seen today. Ibrahim would ask them, [...] "What are you worshiping? Do these idols hear when you call them? Can they help you or hurt you?" [...] The people would reply, [...] "It is the way of our forefathers." [...] Ibrahim declared [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>sick</b> of your gods! Truly I am their enemy." [...] After several years, Ibrahim became a young man. He still could not believe that his people were worshipping the statues. He laughed whenever he saw them entering the temple, lowering their heads, silently offering the statues the best of their food, crying and asking forgiveness from them. He started feeling angry towards his people, who could not realize that these are only stones that could neither benefit nor harm them.|$|E
2500|$|Hawthorne's {{time in the}} Berkshires {{was very}} productive. While there, he wrote The House of the Seven Gables (1851), which poet and critic James Russell Lowell said was better than The Scarlet Letter and called [...] "the most {{valuable}} contribution to New England history that has been made." [...] He also wrote The Blithedale Romance (1852), his only work written in the first person. He also published A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys in 1851, {{a collection of short}} stories retelling myths which he had been thinking about writing since 1846. Nevertheless, poet Ellery Channing reported that Hawthorne [...] "has suffered much living in this place". The family enjoyed the scenery of the Berkshires, although Hawthorne did not enjoy the winters in their small house. They left on November 21, 1851. Hawthorne noted, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>sick</b> to death of Berkshire... I have felt languid and dispirited, during almost my whole residence." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shortly after Hudson's {{press release}} {{disclosing}} his infection, William M.

It's just a disease, not a moral affliction." [...] At the same time, Joan Rivers was quoted as saying: [...] "Two years ago, when I hosted a benefit for AIDS, I couldn't get one major star to turn out. ... Rock's admission is a horrendous way to bring AIDS {{to the attention of}} the American public, but by doing so, Rock, in his life, has helped millions in the process. What Rock has done takes true courage." [...] Morgan Fairchild said that [...] "Rock Hudson's death gave AIDS a face." [...] In a telegram Hudson sent to a September 1985 Hollywood AIDS benefit, Commitment to Life, which he was too ill to attend in person, Hudson said: [...] "I am not happy that I <b>am</b> <b>sick.</b> I am not happy that I have AIDS. But if that is helping others, I can at least know that my own misfortune has had some positive worth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Franklin B. Gowen, the {{president}} of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, and of the Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron Company and [...] "the wealthiest anthracite coal mine owner in the world", hired Allan Pinkerton's services to deal with the Mollies. Pinkerton selected James McParland (sometimes called McParlan), a native of County Armagh, to go undercover against the Mollies. Using the alias [...] "James McKenna", he made Shenandoah his headquarters and claimed to have become a trusted member of the organization. His assignment was to collect evidence of murder plots and intrigue, passing this information along to his Pinkerton manager. He also began working secretly with a Pinkerton agent assigned to the Coal and Iron Police for the purpose of coordinating the eventual arrest and prosecution of members of the Molly Maguires. Although there had been fifty [...] "inexplicable murders" [...] between 1863 and 1867 in Schuylkill County, progress in the investigations was slow. There was [...] "a lull in the entire area, broken only by minor shootings". McParland wrote: I <b>am</b> <b>sick</b> and tired of this thing. I seem to make no progress.|$|E
2500|$|West was {{a member}} of Instonians in 2003 and in 2004 he moved to Bangor Cricket Club where he was the team's {{professional}} player for two seasons. He moved to Belfast after marrying a girl from Northern Ireland. As early as 2005, when he finished top of the Northern Cricket Union batting averages and was named Northern Ireland Player of the Year, there was speculation that West might play for Ireland. At the end of the 2005 season, West moved back to Instonians where he was a local player rather than a professional, stating [...] "I enjoyed my two years at Bangor and made a lot of friends there, however, now that I am working full time [...] and living in Belfast it seemed a natural move to come back to Instonians". During his second stint with Instonians, West was occasionally suffered disciplinary problems, and on his departure from the club to join Civil Service North at the end of 2007, West said [...] "I don't want to see another disciplinary committee room. I <b>am</b> <b>sick</b> of it and they are probably sick of me". On signing West, the Civil Service North captain said [...] "In Regan, we have signed a quality batsman and a quality bowler– indeed he is two players in one".|$|E
