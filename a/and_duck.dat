5|$|Unlike most {{livestock}} farming in England at this time, the duck breeders <b>and</b> <b>duck</b> rearers of Aylesbury formed two separate groups. Stock ducks—i.e., ducks kept for breeding—were kept on {{farms in the}} countryside of the Aylesbury Vale, away from the polluted air and water of the town. This kept the ducks healthy, and meant a higher number of fertile eggs.|$|E
5|$|Although widely {{praised by}} Canadian explorers, Halkett's designs had a limited market, {{and he was}} unable to persuade the Royal Navy that they would serve any useful purpose in general naval service. Efforts to market them as {{platforms}} for fishing <b>and</b> <b>duck</b> shooting failed, and they were commercially unsuccessful. Only two Halkett boats, that of Orcadian explorer John Rae, and one held in the Hudson's Bay Company Museum Collection at the Manitoba Museum are known to survive today.|$|E
30|$|Traditionally, chicken, geese, <b>and</b> <b>ducks</b> all graze in the Floral-belt Dai area. Geese <b>and</b> <b>ducks</b> {{go out of}} {{the home}} at dawn every day and go to paddy fields as well as streams to get food. Chickens get their food from the grass on the hillside. At dusk, the housewives make the sound “dodo” and scatter rice to lure the fowl back home.

40|$|AbstractChickens are {{susceptible}} to the highly pathogenic H 5 N 1 strain of avian influenza virus (HPAIV), whereas ducks are not. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to analyse the microRNA expression in the spleen, thymus and bursa of Fabricius of H 5 N 1 -HPAIV-infected and non-infected chickens <b>and</b> <b>ducks.</b> We annotated the genomic positions of <b>duck</b> microRNAs <b>and</b> we compared the microRNA repertoires of chickens <b>and</b> <b>ducks.</b> Our {{results showed that the}} microRNA expression patterns in the homologous immune organs of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens <b>and</b> <b>ducks</b> diverge substantially. Moreover, there was larger divergence between the microRNA expression patterns in immune organs of HPAIV-infected chickens than HPAIV-infected ducks. Together, our results might help to elucidate the roles of microRNAs in the divergent immunity of chickens <b>and</b> <b>ducks</b> against H 5 N 1 HPAIV...|$|R

The Shetland pony and Shetland Sheepdog are two well-known Shetland animal breeds.

5|$|Spells {{are cast}} using mana, not gold {{as in the}} first game. Spells include healing creatures, {{creating}} Imps, and summoning all creatures to a particular location. There are two grades of each spell, upgraded in the Library, the higher grade version being more powerful. For example, an upgraded Create Imp spell summons a level four Imp, whereas the normal version summons a level one Imp. As with the first game, the player can possess a creature and interact with the world from its perspective using its abilities. A special spell {{is the ability to}} summon Horny to assist the player for a short period. In the Campaign mode, it requires the assembling of the talisman, pieces of which are obtained through the discovery of bonus levels. Mana vaults may be scattered across certain levels; these may be claimed to increase mana generation. Other magical items are special items that provide a specific benefit to the player. These include healing all creatures, revealing the map, and locating a hidden level. There are five hidden levels based on mini games such as golf, bowling, <b>and</b> <b>duck</b> shooting.|$|E
