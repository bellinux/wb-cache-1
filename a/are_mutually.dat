5|$|Anarchism {{does not}} offer a fixed body of {{doctrine}} from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy. Many types and traditions of anarchism exist, not all of which <b>are</b> <b>mutually</b> exclusive. Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism. Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications.|$|E
5|$|Kanak {{languages}} are extremely diverse, but French {{serves as the}} official language of New Caledonia. There are 28 distinct Kanak languages, {{as well as many}} dialects, out of the 1,200 Melanesian languages spoken throughout the Pacific. They <b>are</b> <b>mutually</b> incomprehensible. All {{are a part of the}} Oceanic branch of the Austronesian family. They all belong to the New Caledonian subgroup – except for Fagauvea, which is a Polynesian language.|$|E
5|$|The three {{variants}} of the Penrose tiling <b>are</b> <b>mutually</b> locally derivable. Selecting some subsets from the vertices of a P1 tiling allows to produce other non-periodic tilings. If {{the corners of}} one pentagon in P1 are labeled in succession by 1,3,5,2,4 an unambiguous tagging in all the pentagons is established, the order being either clockwise or counterclockwise.|$|E

5|$|Yellowhammer males {{learn their}} songs from their fathers, {{and over the}} course of time {{regional}} dialects have developed, with minor differences to the conclusion of the basic song; all <b>are</b> <b>mutually</b> recognised by birds from different areas. Each male has an individual repertoire of song variants within its regional dialect; females tend to mate with males that share their dialect, and prefer those with the largest repertoires.|$|E
5|$|If {{the three}} given circles <b>are</b> <b>mutually</b> tangent, Apollonius' problem has five {{solutions}}. Three solutions are the given circles themselves, since each is tangent to itself {{and to the}} other two given circles. The remaining two solutions (shown in red in Figure12) correspond to the inscribed and circumscribed circles, and are called Soddy's circles. This special case of Apollonius' problem is also known as the four coins problem. The three given circles of this Apollonius problem form a Steiner chain tangent to the two Soddy's circles.|$|E
5|$|The {{information}} sharing model assumes that individuals search concurrently for finding and joining opportunities while the producer-scrounger model {{assumes that the}} search modes <b>are</b> <b>mutually</b> exclusive. Hopping with the head facing up and downward are observed to be statistically associated with the frequencies of a bird's joining and finding, respectively. When the expected stable frequency of the scrounger tactic was altered by changing the availability of seeds, the relative frequency of hopping with the head up changed accordingly. When the seed distribution made the scrounger tactic unprofitable, the frequency of hopping with the head up diminished and appears to support the predictions of the producer-scrounger model.|$|E

5|$|Ecological {{interactions}} can {{be classified}} broadly into a host and an associate relationship. A host is any entity that harbours another that is called the associate. Relationships within a species that <b>are</b> <b>mutually</b> or reciprocally beneficial are called mutualisms. Examples of mutualism include fungus-growing ants employing agricultural symbiosis, bacteria living in the guts of insects and other organisms, the fig wasp and yucca moth pollination complex, lichens with fungi and photosynthetic algae, and corals with photosynthetic algae. If there is a physical connection between host and associate, the relationship is called symbiosis. Approximately 60% of all plants, for example, have a symbiotic relationship with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi living in their roots forming an exchange network of carbohydrates for mineral nutrients.|$|E
5|$|New Labour {{tended to}} emphasise social justice, {{rather than the}} {{equality}} which {{was the focus of}} previous Labour governments, and challenged the view that social justice and economic efficiency <b>are</b> <b>mutually</b> exclusive. The party's traditional attachment to equality was reduced: Minimum standards and equality of opportunity were promoted over the equality of outcome. The Commission on Social Justice, set up by John Smith, reported in 1994 that the values of social justice were: equal worth of citizens, equal rights to be able to meet their basic needs, the requirement to spread opportunities as much as possible, and the need to remove unjustified inequalities. The party viewed social justice primarily as the requirement to give citizens equal political and economic liberty and also as the need for social citizenship. It encompasses the need for equal distribution of opportunity, with the caveat that things should not be taken from successful people to give to the unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Today, Nahuan {{languages}} are spoken in scattered communities, mostly {{in rural areas}} throughout central Mexico and along the coastline. There are considerable differences among varieties, and some <b>are</b> <b>mutually</b> unintelligible. Huasteca Nahuatl, with over onemillion speakers, is the most-spoken variety. They all {{have been subject to}} varying degrees of influence from Spanish. No modern Nahuan {{languages are}} identical to Classical Nahuatl, but those spoken in and around the Valley of Mexico are generally more closely related to it than those on the periphery. Under Mexico's General Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Peoples promulgated in 2003, Nahuatl and the other 63 indigenous languages of Mexico are recognized as lenguas nacionales ("national languages") in the regions where they are spoken, enjoying the same status as Spanish within their region.|$|E

50|$|Each {{predicate}} P in the ontology has a list {{of other}} same-arity predicates with which P <b>is</b> <b>mutually</b> exclusive. If A <b>is</b> <b>mutually</b> exclusive with predicate B, A’s positive instances and patterns become negative instances and negative patterns for B. For example, if ‘city’, having an instance ‘Boston’ and a pattern ‘mayor of arg1’, <b>is</b> <b>mutually</b> exclusive with ‘scientist’, then ‘Boston’ and ‘mayor of arg1’ will become a negative instance and a negative pattern respectively for ‘scientist.’ Further, Some categories are declared to be a subset of another category. For e.g., ‘athlete’ is a subset of ‘person’.|$|R
