The sample is held in a 1 mm quartz cuvette and the incident angle of the light coming from both arms (M2 and M3) is 45°. The two incident beams have a separation on the vertical axis of about 1 cm, to avoid interference effects. Unlike Z-scan, in the double L-scan the sample is at fixed position and two identical focusing lenses (L2 and L3) move along the propagation axis (z <b>axis).</b> <b>Calibration</b> is required to ensure that z1= z2 during the entire scan.|$|E

In this paper we present a flexible calibration method for the <b>axis</b> <b>calibration</b> of rotation stage which is installed in front of the binocular vision system to increase the system measurement range. By putting a standard ball in front of the binocular vision system, a sequence of pictures is taken by the two cameras with a few different rotation angles of the rotation stage. With the method of space intersection of two straight lines, the reference points(the ball centers at each rotation angles) for <b>axis</b> <b>calibration</b> are figured out. The trail of standard ball is a circle. Since all ball centers of rotation are on a plane perpendicular to the axis, the center of circle is on the axis of rotation stage. The rotation axis of stage is then calibrated according to the calibration model...|$|E

However, OTS has a limit that tracking fails when occlusion of marker occurs. In this paper, sensor fusion with OTS and Inertial Measurement Unit(IMU) is proposed to solve this problem. The proposed algorithm improves the accuracy of tracking system by eliminating scattering error of the sensor and supplements the disadvantages of OTS and IMU through sensor fusion based on Kalman filter.

40|$|Many {{recent works}} have {{demonstrated}} the benefits of knowledge graph embeddings in completing monolingual knowledge graphs. Inasmuch as related knowledge bases are built in several different languages, achieving cross-lingual knowledge alignment will help people in constructing a coherent knowledge base, and assist machines in dealing with different expressions of entity relationships across diverse human languages. Unfortunately, achieving this highly desirable crosslingual alignment by human labor is very costly and errorprone. Thus, we propose MTransE, a translation-based model for multilingual knowledge graph embeddings, to provide a simple and automated solution. By encoding entities and relations of each language in a separated embedding space, MTransE provides transitions for each embedding vector to its cross-lingual counterparts in other spaces, while preserving the functionalities of monolingual embeddings. We deploy three different techniques to represent cross-lingual transitions, namely <b>axis</b> <b>calibration,</b> translation vectors, and linear transformations, and derive five variants for MTransE using different loss functions. Our models can be trained on partially aligned graphs, where just {{a small portion of}} triples are aligned with their cross-lingual counterparts. The experiments on cross-lingual entity matching and triple-wise alignment verification show promising results, with some variants consistently outperforming others on different tasks. We also explore how MTransE preserves the key properties of its monolingual counterpart TransE. Comment: Extended version of the IJCAI- 17 pape...|$|E

40|$|Earth Observing System (EOS) {{spacecraft}} {{will take}} {{measurements of the}} Earth's clouds, oceans, atmosphere, land, and radiation balance. These EOS spacecraft {{are part of the}} National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Mission to Planet Earth, and consist of several series of satellites, with each series specializing in a particular class of observations. This paper focuses on the EOS AM- 1 spacecraft, which is the first of three satellites constituting the EOS AM series (morning equatorial crossing) and the initial spacecraft of the EOS program. EOS AM- 1 has a stringent onboard attitude knowledge requirement, of 36 / 41 / 44 arc seconds (3 sigma) in yaw/roll/pitch, respectively. During normal mission operations, attitude is determined onboard using an extended Kalman sequential filter via measurements from two charge coupled device (CCD) star trackers, one Fine Sun Sensor, and an Inertial Rate Unit. The attitude determination error analysis system (ADEAS) was used to model the spacecraft and mission profile, and in a worst case scenario with only one star tracker in operation, the attitude uncertainty was 9. 7 /ll. 5 / 12. 2 arc seconds (3 sigma) in yaw/roll/pitch. The quoted result assumed the spacecraft was in nominal attitude, using only the 1 -rotation per orbit motion of the spacecraft about the pitch <b>axis</b> for <b>calibration</b> of the gyro biases.

40|$|Thermal {{errors are}} one of the most {{significant}} factors affecting machine tool accuracy. Error compensation has been widely used to reduce the thermal errors, the robustness of the thermal error models, however, still needs to be improvement. Currently, five-axis machine tools are becoming more important and extensively utilized in industry. In this regard, the geometric errors of rotary axis must be properly measured and corrected to assure the accuracy of five-axis machining. Thermal error model, relating temperature variations to thermal errors, is the core of an effective thermal error compensation strategy. Thermal modal analysis, unveiling the essence of thermo-elastic process, is explored for the determination of temperature sensor placement based on the finite element analysis and eigen analysis. Thermal error models are thus derived based on the temperature variations collected from the specified temperature sensors. The robustness of the derived models is investigated in terms of linear extrapolation and frequency sensitivity. Numerical simulation and experiments are conducted to illustrate the existence of thermal modes and validate the robustness of the thermal error models. Thermal loop analysis is developed for the thermal error compensation of an entire machine tool. A machine tool is first decomposed into several thermal links along an identified thermal loop. For each thermal link, the thermal modal analysis is carried out for the derivation of thermal error model. These thermal links are finally reassembled for the thermal error prediction of the entire machine tool. The thermal loop analysis mitigates the inaccurate modeling of machine joints, and extensively facilitates the utilization of the finite element method in the thermal error modeling and compensation. <b>Calibration</b> of rotary <b>axis</b> of five-axis machine tools is usually time-consuming and laborious by using laser interferometer or autocollimator systems. The Telescopic Magnetic Ball Bar is explored to estimate error components induced by the rotational motion of a rotary <b>axis.</b> The <b>calibration</b> algorithm is developed based on the rigorous mathematical derivation. The setup errors, including parameter variation and eccentricity, have been accounted for through the numerical simulation, enabling the practical utilization of this method. This approach shows the advantages of easy setup and quick assessment...|$|R
40|$|We {{recently}} {{demonstrated that}} serum analysis using affinity based matrix assisted lazer desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry) is capable {{to distinguish between}} patients with early onset preeclampsia and matched controls (Pecks et al. 2010). We then aimed to evaluate the potential diagnostic value of this method in a multicentric setting. Additionally, we aimed to extend our analysis to late onset preeclampsia. A total of 126 serum samples of preeclamptic (60) and healthy pregnant women (66) were collected in four perinatal care centers. Serum analysis was performed as described previously using MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry. The findings of Pecks and Seidenspinner were confirmed by repeated measuring of their sample set. Established rules however displayed restricted applicability to center two, three and four since predefined cut off values failed at differing peak intensities. Standardizing intensities center wise by grouping peak intensities of preeclamptic and control patients provided applicability over all centers apart from center four, where no control patient data was available. Therefore, those samples were excluded from further analysis. Aiming to improve compatibility on the m/z <b>axis</b> respectively, internal <b>calibration</b> based on calculated masses from single and double charged transthyretin ([M+H]+: 13, 762 Da; [M+H] 2 +: 6, 881 Da) was introduced. Newly added modifications amended the pre-established analysis and sample classification resulted in a sensitivity of 87. 8 % and a specificity of 74. 2 %. Separate calculations solely for early onset preeclampsia bring forth a sensitivity of 90. 6 % and specificity of 86. 7 % and might explain the decline in our overall sensitivity/specificity versus values from Pecks and Seidenspinner. Our results imply that MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry serum-profiling together with center-wise standardization offers a robust method to classify preeclampsia from control samples over several centers. Furthermore, the score shows a tendency to increase in case of more severe conditions or poorly fetal outcome. Therefore, the six used peak ratios should be amended or substituted to use the MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry to full capacity for preeclampsia subclass investigation...|$|R
40|$|Electrostatic forces {{strongly}} {{influence the}} behavior of granular materials in both dispersed (cloud) systems and semi-packed systems. These forces can cause aggregation or dispersion of particles and are important {{in a variety of}} astrophysical and planetary settings. There are also many industrial and commercial settings where granular matter and electrostatics become partners for both good and bad. This partnership is important for human exploration on Mars where dust adheres to suits, machines, and habitats. Long-range Coulombic (electrostatic) forces, as opposed to contact-induced dipoles and van der Waals attractions, are generally regarded as resulting from net charge. We have proposed that in addition to net charge interactions, randomly distributed charge carriers on grains will result in a dipole moment regardless of any net charge. If grains are unconfined, or fluidized, they will rotate so that the dipole always induces attraction between grains. Aggregates are readily formed, and Coulombic polarity resulting from the dipole produces end-to-end stacking of grains to form filamentary aggregates. This has been demonstrated in USML experiments on Space Shuttle where microgravity facilitated the unmasking of static forces. It has also been demonstrated in a computer model using grains with charge carriers of both sign. Model results very closely resembled micro-g results with actual sand grains. Further computer modeling of the aggregation process has been conducted to improve our understanding of the aggregation process, and to provide a predictive tool for microgravity experiments slated for Space Station. These experiments will attempt to prove the dipole concept as outlined above. We have considerably enhanced the original computer model: refinements to the algorithm have improved the fidelity of grain behavior during grain contact, special {{attention has been paid to}} simulation time steps to enable establishment of a meaningful, quantitative time <b>axis,</b> and <b>calibration</b> of rounding accuracies have been conducted to test cumulative numerical influences in the model. The model has been run for larger grain populations, variable initial cloud densities, and we have introduced random net charging to individual grains, as well as a net charge to the cloud as a whole. The model uses 3 positive and 3 negative charges randomly distributed on each grain, with up to 160 grains contained within various size "boxes" that define the initial number densities in the clouds. Each charge represents localized charged region on a grain, but does not necessarily imply single quantized charge carriers. The Coulomb equations are then allowed to interact for each monopole: dipoles and any higher order charge coupling is a natural product of these "free" interactions over which the modeler exerts no influence. The charges are placed on surfaces of grains at random locations. A series of runs was conducted for neutral grains that had a perfect balance of negative and positive char carriers. Runs were also conducted with grains having additional fractional charges ranging between 0 and 1. By adding fractional charges of one sign, the model created grain populations in which all grains had excess charges the same sign, giving the cloud an overall net charge. This simulates clouds subjected to ionizing radiation (e. protoplanetary debris disk around a protosun), or any other process of charge biasing in a grain population (e. g., volcanic plumes). In another run series, random fractional charges of either sign were added to the grains so th some grains had a slight net positive charge while others had a slight net negative charge. This simulates triboelectrically-charged grain populations in which acquisition of an electron by one surface is at the expense creating a hole elsewhere. This dual sign charging was applied in two ways: in one case the cloud remained neutral by ensuring that all grain excess charges added to zero; in the other case, the cloud was permitted slight net char by not imposing a charge-balance condition.
