5|$|The Disney bomb saw {{limited use}} by the United States Army Air Forces in Europe from February to April 1945. Although {{technically}} successful, it initially lacked the pinpoint accuracy required for bunker targets. It was deployed late in the war <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> effect on the Allied bombing campaign against Germany.|$|E
5|$|The {{deportation}} of Belgian workers proved {{insufficient to}} meet German industrial needs <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> effect economically. Politically, however, {{it led to}} widespread condemnation in Belgium and internationally, helping {{the rise of the}} resistance. In late 1917, under pressure from neutral powers, most of the Belgian deported workers were returned.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{worked to}} {{coordinate}} {{resistance to the}} Coercive Acts. In May 1774, the Boston Town Meeting (with Adams serving as moderator) organized an economic boycott of British goods. In June, Adams headed a committee in the Massachusetts House—with the doors locked to prevent Gage from dissolving the legislature—which proposed that an inter-colonial congress meet in Philadelphia in September. He was one of five delegates chosen to attend the First Continental Congress. Adams was never fashionably dressed <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> money, so friends bought him new clothes and paid his expenses for the journey to Philadelphia, his first trip outside of Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|Both of the {{targeted}} airfields contained sector operations rooms {{from which the}} British fighters were directed into action. These airfields were selected by the Luftwaffe {{because they were the}} largest ones known to be operating RAF fighters. The German intelligence had no knowledge of the sector operations rooms there. The rooms were above ground <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> protection. If these buildings were to be hit, it would be a serious blow to the control system in the region.|$|E
5|$|In the 2002–03 WNCL, Ebsary {{played in}} all eight matches, but was given less {{responsibility}} {{with the ball}} <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> success. She bowled only 23 overs and took two wickets at 34.00. She also had little effect with the bat, scoring 63 runs at 11.50 with a best score of 18. South Australia won five of their matches, narrowly missing the finals. Up to this point her batting average in 16 completed innings was 8.37.|$|E
5|$|It was at {{this point}} that the Non-Intervention Committee was created to uphold the agreement, but the double-dealing of the USSR and Germany had already become apparent. It also removed the need for a {{declaration}} of neutrality (which would have granted the Nationalists and Republicans control over neutrals in the areas they controlled), <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> legal standing. In Britain, part of the reasoning was based on an exaggerated belief in Germany's and Italy's preparedness for war.|$|E

Bond, who at this point in her career was known primarily as a concert singer <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> experience as an actress, did not feel capable of performing dialogue, and these passages were revised to cut Hebe's dialogue. Hebe's cut dialogue is occasionally restored in modern performances.|$|E
5|$|Of the 332 {{people on}} board, 64 were rescued. Most {{of the crew}} and {{passengers}} were asleep {{at the time of}} attack <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> chance to escape. It was estimated that up to 200 people may have been alive at the time Centaur submerged. Several who made it off the ship later died from shrapnel wounds or burns; others were unable to find support and drowned.|$|E
5|$|Proctor {{had taken}} as many prisoners {{as he had}} soldiers, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> power to enforce the terms he had agreed to. The American non-commissioned {{officers}} were paroled to return home. Madison and the other officers were taken to Fort Malden, then on to a prison in Quebec. The American wounded who could not march were left {{under the care of}} American physicians. Shortly after the battle, the Indians looted the American provisions, which included a large quantity of whiskey. Drunk and violent, they slaughtered many of the American wounded in {{what became known as the}} Massacre of the River Raisin.|$|E

5|$|A weary Emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, an {{increasingly}} discontented ruling class who were dismissive of the Imperial role in national affairs: all these factors presaged the monarchy's impending doom. The means to achieve the overthrow of the Imperial system would soon appear within the Army ranks. Republicanism had never flourished in Brazil outside of certain elitist circles, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> support in the provinces. A growing combination of republican and Positivist ideals among the army's junior and mid-level officer ranks, however, began to form a serious threat to the monarchy. These officers favored a republican dictatorship, which they believed would be superior to the liberal democratic monarchy. Beginning with small acts of insubordination {{at the beginning of the}} 1880s, discontent in the army grew in scope and audacity during the decade, as the Emperor was uninterested and the politicians proved incapable of re-establishing the government's authority over the military.|$|E
5|$|After the crisis, superpower {{relations}} improved, as Kennedy gave a conciliatory {{speech at}} American University on 10 June 1963, recognizing the Soviet people's suffering during World War II, and paying tribute to their achievements. Khrushchev called the speech the best by a U.S. president since Franklin Roosevelt, and, in July, negotiated a {{test ban treaty}} with U.S. negotiator Averell Harriman and with Lord Hailsham of the United Kingdom. Plans for a second Khrushchev-Kennedy summit were dashed by the U.S. President's assassination in November 1963. The new U.S. President, Lyndon Johnson, hoped for continued improved relations but was distracted by other issues <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> opportunity to develop a relationship with Khrushchev before the premier was ousted.|$|E
5|$|As a leader, Patton {{was known}} to be highly critical, {{correcting}} subordinates mercilessly for the slightest infractions, but also being quick to praise their accomplishments. Although he garnered a reputation as a general who was both impatient and impulsive <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> tolerance for officers who had failed to succeed, he fired only one general during World War II, Orlando Ward, and only after two warnings, whereas Bradley sacked several generals during the war. Patton reportedly had the utmost respect for the men serving in his command, particularly the wounded. Many of his directives showed special trouble to care for the enlisted men under his command, and he was well known for arranging extra supplies for battlefield soldiers, including blankets and extra socks, galoshes, and other items normally in short supply at the front.|$|E

He was also without electricity <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> food or water. Al-Nasr team president Ahmed Elturki also told Owumi that the airport in Libya had been burned down by protesters and advised him to remain in his apartment. Trapped in Mutassim's apartment during conflict, Owumi was eventually forced to drink toilet water with tea bags, urinate in the bathtub, and defecate into plastic bags. He also ate cockroaches and worms he found in the flower pots. His poor living conditions caused his teeth to rot and his skin to discolor.|$|E
5|$|Espejo {{particularly}} {{criticized the}} Jesuits for, among other things, teaching ethics {{not as a}} science but {{as a guide to}} good manners and for their adoption of Probabilism as a moral guide. He complained about the lax system for educating priests in Quito and said it instilled slothful habits in students. As a result, the priests had no real idea of their duties towards society and God <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> inclination to study. In El Nuevo Luciano de Quito, he lamented the large number of quacks who pretended to be doctors. In La ciencia blancardina he continued his attack on these quacks while attacking clerics who worked as physicians without adequate medical education.|$|E
5|$|In 1652, the English {{parliament}} {{declared that}} Scotland {{was part of}} the Commonwealth. Various attempts were made to legitimise the union, calling representatives from the Scottish burghs and shires to negotiations and to various English parliaments, where they were always under-represented <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> opportunity for dissent. However, final ratification was delayed by Cromwell's problems with his various parliaments and the union did not become the subject of an act until 1657. The military administration in Scotland, led by General George Monck, was relatively successful. It managed to enforce law and order, suppressing the banditry of the Moss-troopers and enforcing a form of limited religious toleration, but by introducing English judges largely suspending the Scots law. In 1653–55 there was a major Royalist rising in the Highlands led by William Cunningham, 9th Earl of Glencairn and John Middleton, which was defeated at the Battle of Dalnaspidal on 19 July 1654.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, Davidson {{was born}} to Francis and Annette Davidson, the former a {{businessman}} and the latter a concert pianist. He was the third of four children, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> opportunity to be around horses until {{his family moved to}} Westport, Massachusetts, when he was a child. A family friend introduced Davidson to horses, and he began attending Pony Club events. He bought, trained and sold horses until he found a championship horse in Irish Cap, the horse that took him to his first gold medal at the 1974 World Eventing Championship. Davidson went to college at Iowa State University with a veterinary major, but left in his third year to train with the United States Equestrian Team (USET).|$|E
5|$|In {{analyzing}} {{the creation of}} the Polish Legions, many historians have argued that Napoleon used the Poles as a source of recruits <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> desire to invest in the re-creation of the Polish state. Among the most notable of Napoleon's contemporary Polish detractors was Kościuszko, who refused to join the Legions, arguing that Napoleon would not restore Poland in any durable form. In this regard, Kościuszko also stated that the Duchy of Warsaw was created in 1807 only because it was expedient, rather than because Napoleon supported Polish sovereignty. Nevertheless, the memory of Napoleon's Polish Legions is strong in Poland, and Napoleon himself is often regarded as a hero and liberator there. About the Polish Legion, Napoleon himself is reputed to have said that 800 Poles would equal 8,000 enemy soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Nixon in China {{formally}} premiered on the Brown Stage {{at the new}} Wortham Theater Center in Houston on October 22, 1987, with John DeMain {{conducting the}} Houston Grand Opera.

A Nixon representative later stated that the former president disliked seeing himself on television or other media, <b>and</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> interest in opera. According to Adams, he was later told by former Nixon lawyer Leonard Garment that Nixon was highly interested in everything written about him, and so likely saw the Houston production when it was televised on PBS' Great Performances.|$|E
