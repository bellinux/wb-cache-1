5|$|Seismic <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> {{monitored}} by the USGS Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Washington, which issues weekly updates (and daily updates if significant eruptive <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> occurring at a Cascades volcano).|$|E
5|$|Initial Vulcanian <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> {{characterized}} {{by a series of}} short-lived explosions, lasting a few minutes to a few hours and typified by the ejection of volcanic bombs and blocks. These eruptions wear down the lava dome holding the magma down, and it disintegrates, leading to much more quiet and continuous eruptions. Thus an early sign of future Vulcanian <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> lava dome growth, and its collapse generates an outpouring of pyroclastic material down the volcano's slope.|$|E
5|$|Normally brain {{electrical}} <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> non-synchronous. Its <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> {{regulated by}} various factors {{both within the}} neuron and the cellular environment. Factors within the neuron include the type, number and distribution of ion channels, changes to receptors and changes of gene expression. Factors around the neuron include ion concentrations, synaptic plasticity and regulation of transmitter breakdown by glial cells.|$|E
30|$|CAT <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> assayed by {{determination}} of the initial rate of hydrogen peroxide disappearance according to Aebi ([1983]). <b>Activity</b> <b>was</b> measured spectrophotometrically at 240  nm (E[*]=[*] 0.0394  mM− 1  cm− 1). GR <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> determined by the method of Halliwell and Foyer ([1978]). <b>Activity</b> <b>was</b> determined at 340  nm by measuring the decrease of NADPH absorbance (E[*]=[*] 6.1  mM− 1  cm− 1). APX <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> assayed by the method of Nakano and Asada ([1987]). <b>Activity</b> <b>was</b> determined at 290  nm by measuring the decrease of ascorbic acid (E[*]=[*] 2.8  mM− 1  cm− 1). PODs <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> determined by the method of Putter ([1974]). PODs <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> measured spectrophotometrically at 436  nm by the formation of guaiacol dehydrogenation products (E[*]=[*] 25.5  μM− 1  cm− 1).|$|R
30|$|Ascorbate {{peroxidase}} (APX) <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> {{determined by}} the method of Nakano and Asada (1981). One unit of APX <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> defined as 1 -M ascorbate oxidized per minute at 290  nm and the specific <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> expressed as U mg− 1 protein.|$|R
40|$|Both glutamine: [alpha]-ketoglutarate amidotransferase and {{glutamate}} dehydrogenase <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> obtained from grown in minimal medium containing glucose and ammonia. These <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> not additive, suggesting {{an interaction between}} them. Normally both of these <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> equally inhibited by homoserine. In mutants resistant to homoserine inhibition both <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> affected in parallel. Furthermore, {{the ratio of the}} wild-type activities remains constant over a 30 -fold range in purification. This evidence suggests that these <b>activities</b> <b>are</b> associated with a single complex. A possible role for this complex in the regulation of primary amination is discussed...|$|R
5|$|Proponents of internalism are {{committed}} to the view that neural <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> sufficient to produce the mind.|$|E
5|$|The volcano has two {{fields of}} fumaroles (<) {{in the area}} between Uturunku's two summits and has caused {{hydrothermal}} alteration of country rock. These fumaroles form visible clouds of steam. This heat may have been replenished from the APVC melt generating zone or survived since the last eruption of the volcano. Fumarolic <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> distinct enough to be visible from ASTER satellite image but barely visible from the ground. The temperature of the hotspot has been relatively constant in contrast to Lascar. The presence of lava flows overlying moraines, which indicate post-glacial <b>activity,</b> <b>is</b> controversial; the summit lava flows have been glaciated.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} main ways that enzyme <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> {{controlled}} in the cell.|$|E
40|$|Glycolic acid oxidase <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> {{detected}} in cell-free preparations of Anabaena flos-aquae and Oscillatoria sp. by {{the reduction of}} 2, 6 -dichlorophenolindophenol and by the formation of glyoxylate. Enzyme <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> localized in the 20, 000 times gravity supernatant fraction, and optimal <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> obtained at pH 8. 0. <b>Activity</b> <b>was</b> lost on storing the preparation at 4 C {{and could not be}} restored by addition of flavin mononucleotide...|$|R
40|$|Inhibition of cholinesterase (ChE) <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> {{examined}} by experiments on enzyme activity of ChE of rat administered intraperitoneally chlorpyrifos and enzyme kinetic study of ChE in plasma. Plasma ChE <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> inhibited more highly than erythrocyte ChE activity in rat 12 hrs after administration. Plasma ChE <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> recovered 1 month after administration but erythrocyte ChE <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> not recovered. No difference between frontal cortex and striatum ChE <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> recognized. Changes in brain ChE <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> {{similar to those}} in erythrocyte ChE activity. PAM affected the inhibition of ChE activity by chlorpyrifos on 3 hrs after administration but other ChE <b>activities</b> <b>were</b> not. Uncompetitive inhibition between chlorpyrifos and ChE was proved by Lineweaver-Burk plots. Inhibition of ChE isoenzyme was found on bands 4 and 7 by electrophoresis. These results suggest that plasma ChE was effective for exposure monitoring and erythrocyte ChE was effective for effect monitoring...|$|R
40|$|Protein kinase <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> {{found in}} the acidic nuclear protein {{fraction}} extracted from rat liver nuclei. Four distinct kinase <b>activities</b> <b>were</b> separated by phosphocellulose and DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. Additional evidence for separate enzyme <b>activities</b> <b>is</b> based on differences in pH optimum, enzyme stability, and substrate specificity...|$|R
5|$|Warfarin <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> {{determined}} partially by genetic factors. Polymorphisms in two genes (VKORC1 and CYP2C9) play {{a particularly}} {{large role in}} response to warfarin.|$|E
5|$|A pKa value {{obtained}} in a mixed solvent {{cannot be used}} directly for aqueous solutions. The {{reason for this is}} that when the solvent is in its standard state its <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> defined as one. For example, the standard state of water:dioxane 9:1 is precisely that solvent mixture, with no added solutes. To obtain the pKa value for use with aqueous solutions it has to be extrapolated to zero co-solvent concentration from values obtained from various co-solvent mixtures.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} previously, {{the molecules}} that underlie LTP {{can be classified}} as mediators or modulators. A mediator of LTP is a molecule, such as the NMDA receptor or calcium, whose presence and <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> necessary for generating LTP under nearly all conditions. By contrast, a modulator is a molecule that can alter LTP but is not essential for its generation or expression.|$|E
40|$|Peptidyl prolyl cis-trans-isomerase (PPI) <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> {{detected}} in microsomal fractions from bovine and rat liver. Extensive washing, proteinase and sonication treatments indicated that {{although some of}} this <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> due to adsorbed cytosolic enzymes, {{there was also an}} active but latent microsomal PPI activity. Density-gradient subfractionation indicated that <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> associated with vesicles derived from both the rough and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER), suggesting that the <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> located within the ER lumen. The luminal PPI <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> inhibited by cyclosporin A and was active towards an unfolded protein substrate as well as towards the standard peptide substrate...|$|R
40|$|Leishmania donovani promastigotes were collected, washed, {{resuspended}} in buffer, and assayed for sucrase <b>activity.</b> No <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> {{observed in}} the intact washed cells, but <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> measurable when the cells were permeabilized with Triton X- 100. Intracellular sucrase <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> highest in promastigotes grown at pH 7. 4, somewhat lower in promastigotes grown at pH 5. 5, and significantly lower in "amastigotes" grown at pH 5. 5. No trehalase, lactase, or maltase <b>activities</b> <b>were</b> observed. Assay of the medium in which the cells had grown showed that most the sucrase <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> extracellular, i. e. was secreted into the medium during growth...|$|R

5|$|California spiny {{lobsters}} are nocturnal, hiding in crevices during the day, {{with only the}} tips of their long antennae showing, {{as a means of}} avoiding predators. Towards dawn, the {{spiny lobsters}} form aggregations, which they maintain until dusk. At night, they emerge and feed on sea urchins, clams, mussels and worms. This <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> important in limiting sea urchin populations, and so maintaining healthy seabed communities.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{species such}} as Gnathamitermes tubiformans have {{seasonal}} food habits. For example, they may preferentially consume Red three-awn (Aristida longiseta) during the summer, Buffalograss (Buchloe dactyloides) from May to August, and blue grama Bouteloua gracilis during spring, summer and autumn. Colonies of G.tubiformans consume less food in spring than they do during autumn when their feeding <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> high.|$|E
5|$|Corbett {{has been}} a haunt for {{tourists}} and wildlife lovers for a long time. Tourism <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> only allowed in selected areas of Corbett Tiger Reserve so that people {{get an opportunity to}} see its splendid landscape and the diverse wildlife. In recent years the number of people coming here has increased dramatically. Presently, every season more than 70,000 visitors come to the park.|$|E
30|$|Extracellular enzyme <b>activities</b> <b>were</b> {{determined}} spectrophotometrically {{in culture}} supernatant obtained by filtering through 0.45  μm syringe filters. Lignin peroxidase (LiP) was assessed at 30  °C using veratryI alcohol as substrate (Tien and Kirk 1988). MnP <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> assayed using Mn(II) as the substrate (Paszczyński et al. 1988). Laccase <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> measured by monitoring the oxidation of 2, 6 -dimethoxiphenol (DMP) as described before (Cruz-Morató et al. 2013). The enzyme <b>activities</b> <b>were</b> expressed in units (U: micromoles/min).|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlhagi maurorum Medic., Conyza dioscoridis (L.) Desf., Convolvulus fatmensis G. Kunze., Diplotaxis acris (Forssk) Boiss and Origanum syriacum L. were {{evaluated}} for their phytochemical contents. Moreover, their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive and antipyretic <b>activities</b> <b>were</b> evaluated in lab animals at doses of 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg. The antioxidant <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> estimated using DPPH free radical scavenging activity method for the alcoholic extracts of the investigated plants at different concentrations (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 mg/ml). The anti-inflammatory <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> estimated using carrageenan-induced rat paw edema method and the <b>activities</b> <b>were</b> {{compared to that}} of diclofenac sodium (30 mg/kg). The antinociceptive <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> estimated peripherally and centrally using the writhing and the hot plate tests, respectively. The antipyretic <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> estimated using Brewer's yeast-induced hyperpyrexia in rats and the <b>activities</b> <b>were</b> {{compared to that of}} diclofenac sodium. All plants possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive activities in a dose dependent manner. No antipyretic <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> detected for all the investigated plants at the used doses. The activity of the investigated plants could be explained, at least by their antioxidant properties, due to their high flavonoid contents...|$|R
40|$|Acyl-CoA:O-lysophospholipid acyltransferase <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> {{measured}} in extracts of developing safflower (Carthamus tinctorius var. UC- 1) seeds. Acyltransferase <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> {{present in all}} subcellular fractions. The microsomal acyltransferase <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> solubilized with either 30 mm-n-octylglucoside, 1 % deoxycholate, or 100 μm lysophosphatidylcholine. The pH optimum of the lysophosphatidylcholine-dependent acyltransferase <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> at 9. 0. Among the various acyl-CoA's tested, oleoyl-CoA was the best substrate {{and with it the}} enzyme had a Km of 9. 5 μm. Among the various acyl acceptors tested, lysophosphatidylcholine (oleoyl) gave the highest activity and the optimal concentration was 30 μm. Acyltransferase <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> stimulated by ethanol and inhibited by bovine serum albumin and divalent cations...|$|R
5|$|Dopamine-related {{activity}} in the basal ganglia can be directly measured with PET and SPECT scans. A finding of reduced dopamine-related {{activity in}} the basal ganglia can rule out drug-induced parkinsonism, but reduced basal ganglia dopamine-related <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> seen in both PD and the Parkinson-plus disorders so these scans are not reliable in distinguishing PD from other neurodegenerative causes of parkinsonism.|$|E
5|$|During the season, three hurricanes {{developed}} from five named storms. This was below {{the average of}} 10storms per season, and represented the fewest tropical storms since 1939. Four of the five storms {{developed from}} the intertropical convergence zone. The decreased <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> partially due to the westerlies extending further south than usual, {{as well as a}} persistent ridge. In addition, temperatures in the eastern United States were cooler than usual. Activity through September10 was the quietest in 30years.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} is {{the study}} of the chemical reactions that are catalysed by enzymes. In enzyme kinetics, the reaction rate is measured and the effects of varying the conditions of the reaction are investigated. Studying an enzyme's kinetics in this way can reveal the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme, its role in metabolism, how its <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> controlled, and how a drug or an agonist might inhibit the enzyme.|$|E
30|$|The enzyme showed {{activity}} at all temperatures studied. However, optimum <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> at 50  °C (711.43 U/mL) (Fig.  3 b). Xylanase <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> gradually increasing from the lowest temperature up to 50  °C. From 55  °C enzymatic <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> reduced until reaching {{the value of}} 294.98  U/mL at 70  °C.|$|R
30|$|Phytochemical {{screening}} and determination of phenolic compounds content were performed using standard methods. Antiangiogenic <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> assessed using chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model and Drabkin test. Anti-inflammatory <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> estimated by protein denaturation and erythrocyte membrane stabilization method. Finally the antioxidant <b>activity</b> <b>was</b> appreciated by DPPH radical inhibition and phosphomolybdenum assay.|$|R
40|$|Hexose {{phosphate}} synthase and hexulose phosphate isomerase <b>activities</b> <b>were</b> {{found in}} trimethylamine-grown bacterium 2 B 2, a facultative methylotroph.

5|$|Enzymes {{that require}} a {{cofactor}} but do not have one bound are called apoenzymes or apoproteins. An enzyme together with the cofactor(s) required for <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> called a holoenzyme (or haloenzyme). The term holoenzyme can also be applied to enzymes that contain multiple protein subunits, such as the DNA polymerases; here the holoenzyme is the complete complex containing all the subunits needed for activity.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{agriculture}} is {{found only in}} the province's southern areas, although there is grain farming in the Carrot Valley Region (near The Pas). The most common agricultural <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> cattle husbandry (34.6%), followed by assorted grains (19.0%) and oilseed (7.9%). Around 12 percent of Canada's farmland is in Manitoba.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{emplacement}} of late Pliocene lava domes, lesser activity {{continued into}} the Quaternary period (2.58 million years ago to present). Initial volcanism began on {{the summit of the}} volcano, depositing lava in and adjacent to the Level Mountain Range. This <b>activity</b> <b>is</b> indirectly dated as Pleistocene age , on the bases of the presence of subglacial and/or intraglacial deposits. Meszah Peak, the highest point of both Level Mountain and the Level Mountain Range, was volcanically active during this eruptive period.|$|E
