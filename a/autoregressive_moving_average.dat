500|$|Stochastic {{models are}} {{formulated}} using stochastic processes. They model economically observable values over time. Most of econometrics {{is based on}} statistics to formulate and test hypotheses about these processes or estimate parameters for them. Between the World Wars, Herman Wold developed a representation of stationary stochastic processes in terms of autoregressive models and a determinist trend. Wold and Jan Tinbergen applied time-series analysis to economic data. Contemporary research on time series statistics consider additional formulations of stationary processes, such as [...] <b>autoregressive</b> <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> models. More general models include [...] autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) models and generalized ARCH (GARCH) models.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes three {{short-term}} forecasting {{models for}} the adjusted external reserves using the seasonal <b>autoregressive</b> integrated <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> (SARIMA), seasonal <b>autoregressive</b> integrated <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> with an exogenous input (SARIMA-X) and an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) processes. The performances of the proposed models are compared with the existing model obtained using an <b>autoregressive</b> integrated <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> (ARIMA) process using the pseudo-out-of-sample forecasting procedure over July 2013 to May 2014. The results show that SARIMA model outperformed the other models in {{three to six months}} forecast horizon, whereas ARDL model performs better in one to two months forecast horizon.

The autoregressive model treats a stochastic variable as depending on its own prior values and on a current independently and identically distributed (iid) stochastic term. The <b>moving</b> <b>average</b> model treats a stochastic variable as depending on the current and past values of an iid stochastic variable.

40|$|Linear {{time series}} methods are {{researched}} under 3 topics, namely, AR (<b>autoregressive),</b> MA (<b>moving</b> <b>averages),</b> and ARMA (<b>autoregressive</b> <b>moving</b> <b>averages)</b> models. On the other hand, the univariate fuzzy time series forecasting methods {{proposed in the}} literature are based on fuzzy lagged (autoregressive (AR)) variables, having not used the error lagged (<b>moving</b> <b>average</b> (MA)) variables except for only two studies in the fuzzy time series literature. Not using MA variables could cause the model specification error in solutions of fuzzy time series. For this reason, this model specification error should be eliminated. In this study, a solution algorithm based on artificial neural networks has been proposed by defining a new high order fuzzy ARMA time series forecasting model that contains fuzzy MA variables along with fuzzy AR variables. It has been pointed out by the applications that the forecasting performance could have been increased by the proposed method {{in accordance with the}} fuzzy AR models in the literature since the proposed method is a high order model and also utilizes artificial neural networks to identify the fuzzy relation...|$|R
