Approximately 770 Australians served in Sudan; nine subsequently died of disease during the return journey while three had been wounded during the campaign.|$|E

5|$|A few {{tropical}} cyclone warnings and watches were issued {{in anticipation of}} Fay's impact on Bermuda, and public schools were closed as a precaution. Despite its modest strength, Fay produced extensive damage on Bermuda. Winds gusting over 100mph (155km/h) clogged roadways with downed trees and utility poles, <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>a</b> majority of the island's electric customers without power. The terminal building at L.F. Wade International Airport was flooded after the storm compromised its roof and sprinkler system. Along the coast, the storm unmoored and destroyed numerous boats. Immediately after the hurricane, 200Bermuda Regiment soldiers were called to clear debris and assist in initial damage repairs. Cleanup efforts overlapped with preparations for {{the approach of the}} stronger Hurricane Gonzalo, which struck the island less than six days later and compounded the damage. Fay and Gonzalo marked the first recorded instance of two Bermuda hurricane landfalls in one season.|$|E

5|$|Accusing the Song {{of violating}} the {{agreement}} and realizing {{the weakness of the}} Song, the Jin generals launched a second punitive campaign, again dividing their troops into two armies. Wanyan Zonghan, who had withdrawn from Taiyuan after the Kaifeng agreement <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>a</b> small force in charge of the siege, came back with his western army. Overwhelmed, Taiyuan fell in September 1126, after 260 days of siege. When the Song court received news of the fall of Taiyuan, the officials who had advocated defending the empire militarily fell from favor again and were replaced by counselors who favored appeasement. In mid December the two Jurchen armies converged on Kaifeng for the second time that year.|$|E

5|$|At the World Cup {{he played}} all three group games against Uruguay, Mexico and France, however in the win against France midfielder Joseph Bonnel racked his studs down Greaves' shin, causing a wound that {{required}} 14 stitches <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>a</b> permanent scar. His replacement, Geoff Hurst, scored {{the winner in}} the quarter-final against Argentina and kept his place {{all the way to}} the final, where Hurst scored a hat-trick as England won the tournament. Greaves was fit to play in the final, but manager Alf Ramsey opted against changing a winning team. Only the 11 players on the pitch at the end of the 4–2 win over West Germany received medals. Following a Football Association-led campaign to persuade FIFA to award medals to all the winners' squad members, Greaves was presented with his medal by Gordon Brown at a ceremony at 10 Downing Street on 10 June 2009. In November 2014, Greaves' medal was sold at auction for £44,000.|$|E

He {{is the son of}} Rita (née Tuckwood) and Brian Bean. He has a younger sister named Lorraine. His father owned a {{fabrication}} shop that employed 50 people, including Bean's mother, who worked as a secretary. Despite becoming relatively wealthy, the family never moved away from the council estate as they preferred to remain close to friends and family. As a child, Bean smashed a glass door during an argument, which left a piece of glass embedded in his leg that briefly impeded his walking <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>a</b> large scar. This prevented him from pursuing his dream of playing football professionally.|$|E

5|$|In {{the same}} interview, Earp claimed that George Hoyt had {{intended}} to kill him, although newspaper accounts from that time report differently. He also said he and Bat Masterson had confronted Clay Allison when {{he was sent to}} Dodge City to finish George Hoyt's job, and that they had forced him to back down. Two other accounts contradicted Earp, crediting cattleman Dick McNulty and Long Branch Saloon owner Chalk Beeson with convincing Allison and his cowboys to surrender their guns.

5|$|Meanwhile, {{civil war}} {{had broken out}} in England between King Stephen and the Empress Matilda, {{resulting}} {{in a period of}} chaos known as the Anarchy. Matilda's uncle, David I of Scotland, invaded England during 1137 in support of her claim. Although Miles de Beauchamp declared himself in support of Stephen, the king decided to retake Bedford Castle before marching north. Stephen formed an army to besiege Bedford Castle but Miles gained advance warning of the attack and took in considerable supplies, preparing for a long siege. Stephen was unable to storm the castle <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>a</b> force under the command of Hugh to starve it into submission whilst he marched north to tackle the Scots invasion.|$|E
5|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{including a}} distant massive planet were also conducted by other groups. Lawler et al. {{found that the}} dynamical effect of Planet Nine would generate a cloud of objects centered around Planet Nine's semi-major axis, with most at greater semi-major axes. A massive planet in a circular orbit at 250 AU {{increased the number of}} high perihelion objects threefold; one at 500 AU with an eccentricity of 0.5 increased these tenfold, <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>a</b> significant fraction with inclinations greater than 60°. Simulations conducted by Nesvorny et al. of the giant planet migration described in the Nice model that included Planet Nine in its nominal orbit yield similar results, with roughly 0.3–0.4 Earth masses of an initial 20 Earth mass planetesimal disk remaining in what they called the Planet Nine cloud {{at the end of a}} simulation of the last 4 billion years.|$|E
5|$|Reginald de Warenne (sometimes Rainald de Warenne; between 1121 and 1126– 1179) was an Anglo-Norman nobleman and royal official.

5|$|Sitting Bull and {{his people}} stayed in Canada for 4 years. Due to the smaller size of the buffalo herds in Canada, Sitting Bull and his men found it {{difficult}} to find enough food to feed his people, who were starving and exhausted.

Before Sitting Bull left Canada, he may have visited Walsh for a final time <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>a</b> ceremonial headdress as a memento.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, {{he acted}} as escort for No. 11 Squadron RAF. Only one enemy aircraft was sighted by Pattle, {{though none of}} the squadron could see it.

It is believed he attacked a reconnaissance Dornier Do 17 from Sturzkampfgeschwader 2 ("dive bomber wing 2") which he claimed destroyed, though it appears it made it back to German lines damaged. On 8 April, despite bad weather, Pattle led an attack on Petrich in Yugoslavia <b>and</b> <b>left</b> <b>a</b> number of enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground.|$|E
