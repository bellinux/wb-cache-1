5000|$|Prism {{diagonal}}s:A prism diagonal uses {{either a}} simple 90-degree <b>angle</b> <b>prism,</b> pentaprism or an Amici roof prism {{rather than a}} mirror to bend the light path. A pentaprism provides the same inverted image orientation as viewing without a diagonal would. A simple 90-degree <b>angle</b> <b>prism</b> provides the same [...] "flipped" [...] or mirror reversed image as a mirror diagonal. An amici roof prism {{on the other hand}} provides a correct non-reversed view. This means that what is seen in the eyepiece is the same as what is seen when looking at the sky, or a star chart or lunar map. The disadvantage of typical [...] "correct image" [...] Amici roof prism diagonals is that because the light path bounces around through a piece of glass, the total amount of light transmitted is less and the multiple reflections required can introduce optical aberrations. Therefore, most Amici roof prisms are more appropriate for low power viewing or for use in spotting scopes for terrestrial rather than astronomical use. On the other hand, a well-made conventional 90-degree prism star diagonal can transmit as much or more light as a mirror, and do so with higher image contrast since there is no possibility of light scattering from a reflective metallic surface as in a mirror diagonal. Also a prism will never degrade over time as a mirror will since there is no reflective metal coating to degrade from oxidation. However prism diagonals may introduce chromatic aberration when used with short focal-length scopes although this isn’t a problem with the popular Schmidt-Cassegrain and Maksutov Cassegrain telescopes, which have long focal lengths. On longer focal ratio telescopes a well-made 90-degree prism diagonal is the optimum choice to deliver the highest image contrast short of using the telescope without a diagonal entirely. However prisms seem to be falling out of favor probably due to marketing forces which have been favoring short focal length instruments which tend to function better with a mirror diagonal. Pentaprism diagonals are extremely difficult to find. In some special cases however, the color dispersion effects of a prism diagonal can be used to advantage to improve the performance of undercorrected refractor objectives (regardless of focal length) by shifting the spherical and color correction of the objective closer to the design optimum. The natural color dispersion properties (overcorrection) of the prism works to lessen or nullify the undercorrection of the objective lens.|$|E

40|$|High {{accuracy}} {{angle measurement}} at the sub-{mu}rad level requires extremely high instrument stability. In {{order to reach}} sub-{mu}rad stability (0. 1 arc second or less) over long time periods, {{it is necessary to}} maintain the test object and almost all of the optical components in the measuring instrument in very steady positions. However, mechanical force relaxation, thermal expansion, and asymmetric structures produce angular and linear displacements in the system resulting in angular measurement error. A Long-Trace-Profiler (LTP) -based stable equipment is used to test precision angular stability with sub-{mu}rad resolution. Long term stability over 15 hours has been measured on different kind of mechanical structures. Temperature monitoring during the tests is extremely important. Some test results showing the effects of thermal variations are presented, which indicate that temperature stability on the order of 0. 1 C is absolutely necessary for repeatable sub-{mu}rad measurements.

The outcome of the first phase of this program was the selection of broadband polarimetric differential interferometry (BPDI) for further prototype instrumentation development. This approach is based on the measurement of the optical path difference (OPD) between two orthogonally polarized light beams in a single-crystal sapphire disk. The objective of this program is to bring the BPDI sensor technology, which has already been demonstrated in the laboratory, to a level where the sensor can be deployed in the harsh industrial environments and will become commercially viable. Research efforts were focused on analyzing and testing factors that impact performance degradation of the initially designed sensor prototype, including sensing element movement within the sensing probe and optical signal quality degradation.

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis {{has been carried out}} in the following two areas of Optical metrology: 1. Measurement and correction of <b>prism</b> <b>angles</b> 2. Measurement of refractive indices using a spectrograph. The <b>prism</b> <b>angles</b> are conventionally tested by mechanical bevel protractors, autocol-limators (angle dekkors), simple interference techniques and interferometers. All these methods have their own limitations either in accuracy or in terms of cost. Mechanical methods are usually employed to measure the <b>angles</b> of <b>prisms.</b> Interference techniques and interferometers are also used but they need optically polished components. For both mechanical and simple interference methods of testing, it is essential to fabricate more than a single component in number. The process of building interferometers or purchasing interferometers, angle dekkors and standard angle gauges is not cost effective for many research laboratories, and medium scale industries. To overcome these difficulties simple and inexpensive methods without sacrificing the accuracy in the bargain are suggested for the measurement of <b>prism</b> <b>angles,</b> based on the principles of reflection of light. The refractive indices of prism materials for invisible and weaker spectral lines are usually determined from spectrograms using dispersion formulae and numerical interpolation techniques. In these methods, the accuracy of the results depends on the accuracy of determining the constants of the dispersion formulae. A simple experimental technique, using a spectrograph, is devised for the measurement of refractive indices of solids and liquids both for visible and invisible spectral lines (wavelengths). The thesis has been divided into six chapters. The first chapter starts with the general introduction. The second chapter presents the literature review of the existing methods for angle and refractive index measurements. The third chapter describes the proposed new techniques for <b>prism</b> <b>angle</b> measurements.

This portable biosensing system designed for field use is characterized by a special structure which consists of a microfluidic cell incorporating a right <b>angle</b> <b>prism</b> functionalized with a biomolecular identification membrane, a laser line generator and a data acquisition circuit board. The data structure, data memory capacity and a line charge-coupled device (CCD) array with a driving circuit for collecting the photoelectric signals are intensively focused on and the high performance analog-to-digital (A/D) converter is comprehensively evaluated. The interface circuit and the photoelectric signal amplifier circuit are first studied to obtain the weak signals from the line CCD array in this experiment. Quantitative measurements for validating the sensitivity of the biosensing system were implemented using ethanol solutions of various concentrations indicated by volume fractions of 5 %, 8 %, 15 %, 20 %, 25 %, and 30 %, respectively, without a biomembrane immobilized on the surface of the SPR sensor.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of nematic liquid crystal optical devices, which exploit the voltage dependent, {{optical path length}} modification of the electrical Freedrichsz transition, is presented. By combining refractive elements in a diffractive zone structure, efficient and flexible devices with relatively high refractive powers can be constructed. Continuously variable optical properties {{can be achieved by}} scaling the optical profile of the refractive elements and applying a phase correction to ensure that the transition between adjacent zones is an integral number of wavelength, hence a continuous optical profile is constructed. Two such devices are postulated; a variable deflection <b>angle</b> <b>prism</b> and a variable focal length lens, though the approach may be extended to other devices. The zones are addressed through combed electrode structures. The required voltage profile is produced by dropping the applied voltages across a shaped conductive strip. A sampling of the profile is transported {{along the length of the}} zone via discrete electrodes. In order to produce the required scalability and independent phase correction of the optical profile, it is necessary to restrict the design and operation of the electrodes to the approximately linear region of the response curve. Two-dimensional optical structures can either be achieved through the use of planar earth plates, to mask connections to the centre of the device, or by cascading devices with electrode structures open to connection at the edges. In order to predict the optical profiles of these and other devices, a model was constructed which describes the director orientation through a two-dimensioned electrode structure. The variational finite element method was employed to minimize the electrical Gibbs free energy of a liquid crystal cell, in order to find the equilibrium director orientation. A preliminary version of this model is presented which is restricted to rotation of the liquid crystal to within the plane of the solution...|$|E
40|$|Planar, {{integrated}} microscale sensors utilizing prism-coupler type angular interrogation sensing technique {{have been}} demonstrated. The main {{structure of the}} sensor consists of an optical prism coupled to a built-in waveguide to introduce Fraunhofer diffraction when light ray comes into the prism from the waveguide. The Fraunhofer diffraction creates spectrum of consecutive rays over the sensing edge of the prism such {{that there is no}} need for the bulky scanning mechanisms typically used in other macro scale sensing systems. Two types of sensors are presented: (1) total internal reflection based critical point detection (CPD) sensor, and (2) surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based resonance point detection (RPD) sensor. The CPD sensor is fabricated by a simple, two-mask process which creates a right <b>angle</b> <b>prism</b> with three sides with lengths of 1, 0. 86, and 1. 33 mm, respectively in the prototype design and a waveguide with a cross sectional area of 4 ~ 0. 25 um 2. The 0. 25 um-thick core and the 2. 5 um-thick cladding layers of the waveguide are made of silicon nitride and silicon dioxide, respectively. The CPD sensing technique measures the shift of the critical point of the total reflection as the results of change of refractive index due to biofouling. Optical simulations are used to validate the working principle and the calculated biofouling sensitivity is comparable to the other optical sensing methods. A baseline measurement has been conducted to verify the operation of the sensor with an error of less than ± 0. 002 R. I. U. During a 9 -hour biofouling measurement using milk as the media, a change in the refractive index as much as 0. 0089 is recorded as the result of biofouling. The RPD sensing technique employs surface plasmon resonance as its sensing mechanism by measuring the shift of the resonance point with respect to the change of the incident angle. The design and fabrication process is similar to the fundamental structure of CPD sensors with an additional deposition of a thin metal layer on the sensing edge of the prism. The theoretical sensitivity is calculated as 90 deg RIU - 1, which is comparable with the state-of-the-art optical sensors at 127 deg RIU - 1. The refractive index measurement for selected liquids agrees with the values in the literature with an error range of less than ± 0. 002 R. I. U. Furthermore, the refractive index change of biofouling formation is measured to be 0. 0078 for a 9 -hour experiment using milk as the testing media...|$|E
