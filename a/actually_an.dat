5|$|Apatodon mirus, {{based on}} a scrap of {{vertebra}} Marsh first {{thought to be a}} mammalian jaw, has been listed as a synonym of Allosaurus fragilis. However, it was considered indeterminate beyond Dinosauria by Dan Chure, and Mickey Mortimer believes that the synonymy of Apatodon with Allosaurus was due to correspondence to Ralph Molnar by John McIntosh, whereby the latter reportedly found a paper saying that Othniel Charles Marsh admitted that the Apatodon holotype was <b>actually</b> <b>an</b> allosaurid dorsal vertebra.|$|E

5|$|Compared to his two fellow protagonists, C.T. Smith was {{considered}} more novel. Anime News Network {{said he was}} one of the few fresh points of the series and had the most distinctive design among the cast, though even his role as an unassuming businessman who is <b>actually</b> <b>an</b> expert gunman felt as if it must be borrowed from somewhere else. MangaCast's reviewer, on the other hand, found his role mostly extraneous, due to being overshadowed by Gamma. Animemaniacs Magazine Online noted that Smith's physical appearance was later echoed by Bleachs central antagonist, Sōsuke Aizen.|$|E

This was <b>actually</b> <b>an</b> old colleague of both Godfrey and Fleming's in the NID, Donald McLachlan.|$|E

It has been {{described}} variously as basalt stone, an agate, a piece of natural glass or—most popularly—a stony meteorite. , the curator of the Austro-Hungarian imperial collection of minerals, published the first comprehensive analysis of the Black Stone in 1857 in which he favoured a meteoritic origin for the Stone. Robert Dietz and John McHone proposed in 1974 that the Black Stone was <b>actually</b> <b>an</b> agate, judging from its physical attributes and a report by an Arab geologist that the Stone contained clearly discernible diffusion banding characteristic of agates.|$|E

5|$|Although these criticisms still {{form the}} {{prevailing}} {{view on the}} History's literary worth, modern scholars such as Rohrbacher have begun to argue that, while it is poorly written and not a stylistic or polished work, its use of allusion {{as a vehicle for}} parodying popular late 4th century biographical and historiographical works means that the very features which were once a cause for intense criticism (such as the inclusion of irrelevant or contradictory inventions alongside traditionally sourced material) are <b>actually</b> <b>an</b> intentional and integral part of the work, {{making it one of the}} most unique pieces of literature to emerge from the ancient world.|$|E

Vick's finances suffered, however, from poor management, bad investments and lawsuits. Certified Financial Planner Michael Smith advised Vick from 2003-2005, but resigned after Vick took bad advice from friends, made ill-conceived investments, overspent, and otherwise undermined the wealth-building plan that Smith had created. Smith's plan was for Vick to have a net wealth of $100 million by 2010; by that date Vick was <b>actually</b> <b>an</b> estimated $20million in debt.|$|E

5|$|Killian has {{manipulated}} American {{intelligence agencies}} regarding the Mandarin's location, luring James Rhodes– the former War Machine, now re-branded as the Iron Patriot– {{into a trap}} to steal the armor. With Harley's help, Stark traces the Mandarin to Miami and infiltrates his headquarters using improvised weapons. Inside he discovers the Mandarin is <b>actually</b> <b>an</b> English actor named Trevor Slattery, who says he is oblivious to the actions carried out in his image. Killian, who appropriated Hansen's Extremis research as a cure for his own disability and expanded the program to include injured war veterans, reveals he is the real Mandarin, using Slattery as a cover. After capturing Stark, Killian shows him Potts (whom he had kidnapped) being subjected to Extremis, {{in order to gain}} Stark's aid to fix Extremis's flaws and thus save Potts. Killian kills Hansen when she has a change of heart and tries to stop him.|$|E
5|$|Lōʻihi Seamount's first {{depiction}} {{on a map}} was on Survey Chart 4115, a bathymetric {{rendering of}} part of Hawaiʻi compiled by the US Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1940. At the time, the seamount was non-notable, being one of many in the region. A large earthquake swarm first brought attention to it in 1952. That same year, geologist Gordon A. MacDonald hypothesized that the seamount was <b>actually</b> <b>an</b> active submarine shield volcano, similar to the two active Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kīlauea. Macdonald's hypothesis placed the seamount as the newest volcano in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, created by the Hawaiʻi hotspot. However, because the earthquakes were oriented east–west (the direction of the volcanic fault) {{and there was no}} volcanic tremor in seismometers distant from the seamount, Macdonald attributed the earthquake to faulting rather than a volcanic eruption.|$|E
