5|$|Bird set fast laps while leading {{and kept}} the lead after his pit stop {{at the end of}} the 16th lap ahead of the yet-to-stop Binder, Ceccon and Evans. Bird was pushing when he slid after {{clipping}} the kerb on the track <b>and</b> <b>glanced</b> the barrier leaving Portier turn on lap 18. Abt was attacking Haryanto for 13th position on lap 28 and went to the outside of Haryanto by braking later than he did. The resulting manoeuvre meant Abt punted Haryanto into the inside barrier with his car's front nose being broken as a consequence. The need for the safety car was avoided as Haryanto's car was extracted from the track quickly. Abt was adjudged to have been too aggressive towards Haryanto by the stewards and was handed a drive-through penalty and was shown a black flag with an orange disc requiring him to make repairs to his car. Dillmann attempted to pass Rosenzweig but ran deep at the Novelle Chicane. He was required to hand the position back to Rosenzweig. Binder made his pit stop on the 29th lap and emerged in seventh place behind Coletti. Bird continued to lead with a seventeen-second advantage over Ceccon who was fending off the faster Evans in third position who himself had Nasr and Calado close behind him.|$|E
25|$|The second {{qualifying}} period was closely fought, with many drivers vying {{for a place}} in Q3 by only a few hundredths of a second, and the exact running order was only resolved in the final few seconds when Pastor Maldonado spun at the final chicane <b>and</b> <b>glanced</b> against the outer wall. Maldonado pushed too hard into the chicane. He managed to keep his car from ploughing into the outer wall, but damaged his right rear wheel and suspension and ultimately finished seventeenth. Romain Grosjean narrowly avoided elimination, but his teammate Kimi Räikkönen finished twelfth, behind Kamui Kobayashi. Despite setting the early pace, Nico Hülkenberg qualified thirteenth, with Daniel Ricciardo alongside him in fourteenth, a full second quicker than teammate Vergne. Sergio Pérez was fifteenth, admitting to having locked up his front tyres at the hairpin on his final flying lap. Bruno Senna qualified sixteenth overall, narrowly ahead of Maldonado.|$|E
25|$|The safety car was {{withdrawn}} after three laps and racing resumed with Asmer leading the field {{back up to}} speed. Jarvis remained close by as he was hoping to making his move on the following lap at Lisboa corner. As Van Der Zande crossed the start/finish line to continue racing, he attempted {{to find his way}} past Kennard. Van Der Zande was unable to get past and ended up drifting into the wall at Lisboa turn while Kennard resumed without trouble. Ho then made a pit stop and retired shortly after. On the fifth lap, Jarvis made his overtaking manoevure on Asmer for the lead by slipstreaming onto the back of him heading down the main straight and passed the driver around the outside at Lisboa corner. At the same time, Senna managed to find his way past Hülkenberg and started to close the gap to Buurmann. Hülkenberg then tried to line up a passing move on Senna to reclaim the position but lost control of his car <b>and</b> <b>glanced</b> the barriers lining the track at Lisboa corner. Both he and Senna were forced into retirement. Localised yellow flags were waved which neutralised racing in that section of the circuit because of debris scattered across the tarmac surface.|$|E

25|$|On lap 17, Bird {{attempted}} to overtake López {{heading into the}} first turn, but the two cars made contact in the corner, causing Bird to run wide and fell to sixth after he was passed by Vergne and di Grassi and was placed under pressure by Abt. Bird lost two further positions when Abt and Prost passed him and López fell to fourth when Vergne overtook the higher-placed Virgin car. Di Grassi passed López entering the first corner shortly after. Buemi was 1.3 seconds behind race leader Rosenqvist by the 20th lap but the latter {{was aware of the}} situation <b>and</b> <b>glanced</b> at his rear-view mirrors to ensure he had large enough of an advantage to remain ahead after the pit stop phase. The mandatory pit stop phase for the switch into a second car began on lap 23 when the leading drivers entered the pit lane. After driving out of his team's garage in his second car, Rosenqvist was released into the path of Heidfeld in the other Mahindra car, causing his teammate to swerve to the outside and nearly entered another team's pit gantry. Heidfeld came to a halt without damaging his car. Although he was briefly delayed, Rosenqvist kept the lead. The stewards immediately investigated Rosenqvist for the pit stop release.|$|E
25|$|Ricciardo {{qualified}} in third, and {{was unable}} to improve on his fastest time after sliding on his final timed lap. His teammate Vettel could not use his energy recovery system {{in the first part of}} qualifying; he ran in a different mode and the yellow flags meant he was restricted to fourth. The two Ferrari cars of Alonso and Räikkönen were fifth and sixth; both had tyre warming problems. Despite his final lap being affected by the yellow flags, Vergne took seventh and his teammate Kvyat secured ninth after struggling with rear-end control and hit the barriers lining the circuit. He drove to the pit lane for a replacement nose cone. They were separated by Magnussen in eighth and Pérez rounded out the top ten after locking his tyres driving into the Novelle chicane. Hülkenberg was the fastest driver not to advance into the final session; his best lap time of one minute and 17.846 second was nearly two seconds slower than Hamilton's pace in the second session. Button was delayed by a Toro Rosso on his final lap at the Swimming Pool complex and was restricted to 12th. Bottas had front tyre heating problems and was only able to qualify 13th. Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado in the two Lotus cars took 14th and 15th with Massa unable to record a lap time. Ericsson locked his rear tyres going into Mirabeau corner <b>and</b> <b>glanced</b> Massa's car heading into the turn, causing both drivers to hit the barriers. The stewards investigated the incident and Ericsson was handed two penalty points on his super licence and was required to start from the pit lane. Gutiérrez failed to advance beyond the first qualifying session, and was followed by Sauber teammate Adrian Sutil. Jules Bianchi lost half a second because of slower traffic and yellow flags and took 19th. He received a five-place grid penalty, because his team changed a problematic gearbox overnight. As a result, his Marussia teammate Chilton inherited 19th. Kamui Kobayashi used super soft compound tyres on his first two timed laps and made a front wing adjustment but {{was unable to}} improve and qualified in 20th.|$|E
2500|$|About {{a minute}} after the shooting, a woman {{seated next to}} her boyfriend in his car {{on the other side}} of the city park saw a [...] "white male [...] a light-colored, cheap nylon wig" [...] sprint from the park and enter a [...] "small, light-colored" [...] auto, which drove away quickly. [...] "He looks like he just robbed a bank", said the woman, who wrote what she could see of the car's license plate. She was unable to {{determine}} the first two characters, but was certain that the others were either 4-GUR or 4-GVR. Other witnesses included a woman who saw a light car speed away from the park about 20 seconds after the gunshots, and at least two witnesses who described a yellow Volkswagen driving quickly from the neighborhood with its headlights off. A neighborhood resident given the pseudonym Mary Lyons heard the gunshots and Violante's calls for help, <b>and</b> <b>glanced</b> from her apartment window to see a man whom she later positively identified as Berkowitz, who was walking casually away from the crime scene as many others were rushing towards the scene to render aid.|$|E
