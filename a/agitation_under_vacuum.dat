A reversed-phase C 18 column (Nova-Pak, 150  mm × 4  mm, 5  µm) from Waters (MA, USA) was used throughout this study. All reagents were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) HPLC grade. The prepared mobile phase was degassed using ultrasonic <b>agitation</b> and filtered <b>under</b> <b>vacuum</b> through a 0.45  µm nylon membrane filter before analysis. The rate flow was set at 1  ml/min. The operating temperature was maintained at room temperature (25  °C).|$|R

40|$|The {{molecular}} weight changes which {{occur on the}} gamma -radiolysis of poly(dimethyl siloxane) <b>under</b> <b>vacuum</b> between 77 and 373 K and in air at 303 K have been investigated using triple detection GPC to obtain the complete {{molecular weight}} distributions for the irradiated samples and {{to determine the number}} and weight average molecular weights. The results have been interpreted in terms of the relative yields of scission and crosslinking. The total yields for crosslinking predominate over those for scission at all the temperatures investigated for radiolysis <b>under</b> <b>vacuum.</b> Based on a solid-state Si- 29 NMR analysis of PDMS irradiated <b>under</b> <b>vacuum</b> at 303 K, which yielded a value of G(Y) of 1. 70, the values of G(S) = 1. 15 +/- 0. 2 and G(H) = 1. 45 +/- 0. 2 were obtained for radiolysis <b>under</b> <b>vacuum</b> at 303 K. For radiolysis in air at 303 K, crosslinking was also predominant, but the nett yield of crosslinking was much less than that observed for radiolysis <b>under</b> <b>vacuum.</b> <b>Under</b> the conditions of the radiolysis in air at 303 K, because of the low solubility of oxygen in PDMS, {{it is likely that the}} radiation chemistry is limited by oxygen diffusion.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Low cycle {{fatigue tests}} were {{performed}} on IN 718 -DA alloy at 600 °C, both in air and <b>under</b> <b>vacuum</b> environment. The effect of an hold time (90 s) at maximum applied total strain was investigated. All the specimens were taken from forged discs. These test results were compared to those obtained on conventional 718 (annealed and aged) tested <b>under</b> <b>vacuum.</b> SEM observations of the fracture surfaces and of the gauge length of the specimens showed various types of initiation sites. Both in air and <b>under</b> <b>vacuum,</b> the fatigue cracks initiated from surface connected particles (carbides and nitrides) or from subsurface particles. The deleterious effect of oxidizing environment on the fatigue life is explained by a preferential oxidation of carbide particles. A mechanism accounting for cleavage of nitride particles due to preferential carbide oxidation is proposed...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to evaluate how the presence of oxygen can affect irradiation-induced degradation reactions of PEGd,lPLA and PEG-PLGA multiblock copolymers submitted to gamma irradiation and to investigate the radiolytic behavior of the polymers. PEGd,lPLA, PEG-PLGA, PLA, and PLGA were irradiated by using a 60 Co irradiation source in air and <b>under</b> <b>vacuum</b> at 25 kGy total dose. Mw and Mn were evaluated by gel permeation chromatography. The stability study was carried out on three samples sets: (a) polymer samples irradiated and stored in air, (b) polymer samples irradiated and stored <b>under</b> <b>vacuum,</b> and (c) polymer samples irradiated <b>under</b> <b>vacuum</b> and stored in air. The thermal and radiolytic behavior was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), respectively. Samples irradiated in air showed remarkable Mw and Mn reduction and Tg value reduction due to radiation-induced chain scission reactions. Higher stability was observed for samples irradiated and stored <b>under</b> <b>vacuum.</b> EPR spectra showed that the presence of PEG units in multiblock copolymer chains leads to: (a) decrease of the radiolytic yield of radicals and (b) decrease of the radical trapping efficiency and faster radical decay rates. It can be concluded that the presence of oxygen during the irradiation process and the storage phase significantly increases the entity of irradiation-induced damage...|$|R
