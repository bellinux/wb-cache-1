40|$|<b>Applied</b> <b>Linguistics</b> is {{a diverse}} field, {{comprising}} {{a substantial number}} of sub-fields, sub-specialisations and related fields. To see that this is the case one need only examine the various handbooks and encyclopaedic references that have been published {{in the last ten years}} to see the wide range of topics that have been covered. As with many professional areas in academia, <b>Applied</b> <b>Linguistics</b> is organised around national organisations, with its international structure being a loose confederation known as the International Association of <b>Applied</b> <b>Linguistics</b> (AILA). Given these diverse academic and structural arrangements, it should not be surprising if academics within different national associations were to cluster around different interests within the field. This study explores the question of what emphases are found in various parts of the world in <b>Applied</b> <b>Linguistics,</b> and in particular, the relationship of Australian <b>Applied</b> <b>Linguistics</b> to international trends using a structural text analysis of abstracts related to <b>Applied</b> <b>Linguistics</b> as well as an historical review of the trends involved...|$|R
40|$|Australias current {{attempt to}} develop a process to {{evaluate}} the quality of research (Excellence in Research for Australia ERA) places a central emphasis on the disciplinary organisation of academic work. This disciplinary focus poses particular problems for <b>Applied</b> <b>Linguistics</b> in Australia. This paper will examine <b>Applied</b> <b>Linguistics</b> in relation to this issue of discipline in two ways. First, it will examine ways in which <b>Applied</b> <b>Linguistics</b> has articulated for itself its disciplinary nature. In most formulations of the focus of <b>Applied</b> <b>Linguistics,</b> the emphasis has not been on identifying a discipline, but rather on identifying an area of focus. Such formulations necessarily cover a very diverse range of research methods, theories, etc. This approach {{can be seen as}} one of emphasising diversity and breadth within the field. Other {{attempts have been made to}} characterise <b>Applied</b> <b>Linguistics</b> in more discipline-like terms. Such broad characterisations however conceal a high degree of internal diversity. <b>Applied</b> <b>Linguistics</b> does not appear to be a discipline but rather an interdisciplinary field of enquiry. Second, the paper will examine some possible implications of the diversity of <b>Applied</b> <b>Linguistics</b> for how it is positioned through the ERA process...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} three {{difficulties}} {{in dealing with}} post-modern <b>applied</b> <b>linguistics</b> are identified, and three reasons are given for taking the trouble to define this emerging tradition of doing <b>applied</b> <b>linguistics.</b> In the context of earlier analyses {{of the history of}} <b>applied</b> <b>linguistics,</b> post-modernism is identified as a sixth generation of applied linguistic work. There are overlapping and unique features in each of these traditions. The discontinuity of a post-modern approach from first generation <b>applied</b> <b>linguistics</b> is noted, as are the numerous continuities with second, fourth, fifth and especially third generation work. These continuities go a long way towards characterising post-modern <b>applied</b> <b>linguistics,</b> yet are not sufficient to define it exhaustively. The biggest difficulty with such a characterisation appears to be a divergence within a post-modern approach. What holds this latest tradition together is the seriousness with which it deals with accountability, and in that lies, at present, its defining characteristic. Wherever one locates one’s work, in earlier or in current traditions within <b>applied</b> <b>linguistics,</b> the premiss must always be to do these labours with integrity. Perhaps the latest trend towards an accountable <b>applied</b> <b>linguistics</b> has contributed more than any previous tradition to make us sensitive to this responsibility...|$|R
50|$|In the United States, <b>applied</b> <b>linguistics</b> {{also began}} {{narrowly}} as {{the application of}} insights from structural linguistics—first {{to the teaching of}} English in schools and subsequently to second and foreign language teaching. The <b>linguistics</b> <b>applied</b> approach to language teaching was promulgated most strenuously by Leonard Bloomfield, who developed the foundation for the Army Specialized Training Program, and by Charles C. Fries, who established the English Language Institute (ELI) at the University of Michigan in 1941. In 1948, the Research Club at Michigan established Language Learning: A Journal of <b>Applied</b> <b>Linguistics,</b> the first journal to bear the term <b>applied</b> <b>linguistics.</b> In the late 1960s, <b>applied</b> <b>linguistics</b> began to establish its own identity as an interdisciplinary field of linguistics concerned with real-world language issues.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the differences and similarities between form and function of if-clauses as one type of conditional clauses within the <b>applied</b> <b>linguistics</b> and chemistry published academic Articles.

According to the findings, if-clauses were more frequent in <b>applied</b> <b>linguistics</b> than chemistry articles. Results of function analysis indicated that, content is the major function in both applied and chemistry articles and comparing two genres, it is more frequent in <b>applied</b> <b>linguistics</b> articles.

40|$|When we {{undertake}} academic, disciplinary work, {{we rely on}} philosophical starting points.

This paper examines the effects of basing our applied linguistic work on the idea that <b>applied</b> <b>linguistics</b> is a discipline concerned with design. Such a characterisation does justice to both modernist and postmodernist emphases in <b>applied</b> <b>linguistics.</b> Conceptualisations of <b>applied</b> <b>linguistics</b> that came with the proposals for communicative language teaching (CLT) some thirty to forty years ago propelled the discipline squarely into postmodern times. To account for this, we need to develop a theory of <b>applied</b> <b>linguistics</b> which shows what constitutive and regulative conditions exist for doing applied linguistic designs. A...|$|R

40|$|This book explores {{neoliberalism}} – {{a view of}} {{the world}} that puts the market at its centre - from the perspective of <b>applied</b> <b>linguistics.</b> Neoliberalism and <b>Applied</b> <b>Linguistics</b> argues that while <b>applied</b> <b>linguistics</b> has become more interdisciplinary in orientation, it has ignored or downplayed the role of political economy, namely the way in which social, political and economic factors relate to one another {{within the context of a}} capitalist economy. The authors take the view that engagement with political economy is central to any fully rounded analysis of language and language-related issues in the world today and their collaboration in this volume represents an initial attempt to redress what they perceive to be an imbalance in the field. The book begins with a discussion of neoliberalism and an analysis of the ways in which neoliberal ideology impacts on language. This is followed by a discussion of how globalization and identity have been conceptualised in <b>applied</b> <b>linguistics</b> in ways which have ignored the political centrality of class – a concept which the authors see as integral to their perspective. The book concludes with an analysis of the ways in which neoliberal ideology plays out in two key areas of <b>applied</b> <b>linguistics</b> – language teaching and language teacher education.
