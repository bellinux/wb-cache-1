The indigenous peasants either had no land, or had far too little to sustain themselves. Three quarters of the labor force were in agriculture, and industry was essentially nonexistent.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} daily excess bond returns {{associated with}} announcements of additions to Standard <b>and</b> <b>Poor's</b> Credit Watch List, and to rating changes by Moody's <b>and</b> Standard <b>and</b> <b>Poor's.</b> Reliably nonzero average excess bond returns are observed for additions to Standard <b>and</b> <b>Poor's</b> Credit Watch List when an expectations model {{is used to}} classify additions as either expected or unexpected. Bond price effects are also observed for actual downgrade and upgrade announcements by rating agencies. Excluding announcements with concurrent disclosures weakens the results for downgrades, but not upgrades. The stock price effects of rating agency announcements are also examined and contrasted with the bond price effects. Copyright 1992 by American Finance Association. ...|$|R
