40|$|The term <b>air</b> <b>cabotage</b> {{refers to}} the {{carriage}} of air traffic between two points within {{the territory of the}} same state. This carriage is generally reserved to the aircraft of the territorial state and is thus inaccessible to foreign carriers. This thesis gives a brief account of the origins of the concept of cabotage in maritime law and of its introduction in the early international air law conventions. The thesis then proceeds to focus on the problem of <b>air</b> <b>cabotage</b> in the North-American context and particularly on the current bilateral negotiations between the USA and Canada at which cabotage rights in the USA are being sought by Canada. It further projects on the EEC context, where air transport liberalization measures toward the completion of a single integrated market will eventually (perhaps very soon) lead to the availability for Community carriers of cabotage rights within any EEC Member State. The creation of a "Community cabotage area" where only Community carriers would be able to carry Community traffic is also analyzed. Finally, the consequences of these developments are examined as far as EEC Member States' obligations under the Chicago Convention and relations with third states are concerned.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} mainly on EEC {{regulation}} of cabotage. Cabotage is {{carriage of passengers}} or goods within the territory of one State by a carrier from another State. The thesis describes the EEC regulation of air, maritime and road transport and {{the positions of the}} different Member States. One of the aims of the thesis is to examine whether a common EEC transport policy already now [...] before the conclusion of the Internal Market in 1992 [...] is in existence. The thesis also examines whether the three transport modes are so different {{that it is impossible to}} talk about a multi-modal EEC cabotage policy. The emphasis of the thesis is on air transport, especially <b>air</b> <b>cabotage</b> and the EEC Member States' international treaty obligations, and the EEC-North America relationship...|$|E
5000|$|At {{least one}} {{international}} law uses U.S. citizen in defining {{a citizen of}} the United States rather than American citizen; for example, the English version of the North American Free Trade Agreement includes: Only air carriers that are [...] "citizens of the United States" [...] may operate aircraft in domestic <b>air</b> service (<b>cabotage)</b> and may provide international scheduled and non-scheduled air service as U.S. air carriers...Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, a [...] "citizen of the United States" [...] means::(a) an individual who is a U.S. citizen;:(b) a partnership in which each member is a U.S. citizen; or:(c) a U.S. corporation of which the president and at least two-thirds {{of the board of directors}} and other managing officers are U.S. citizens, and at least 75 percent of the voting interest in the corporation is owned or controlled by U.S. citizens.|$|R
40|$|This report {{highlights}} the economic challenges associated with diversifying and developing sustainable {{economies in the}} Indian Ocean Territories {{with a focus on}} facilitating business development and service delivery in five main areas. These areas are tourism, information communication technology, transport, housing and environmental management. Key recommendations of the report include: • Identifying ways to diversify the Christmas Island economy with a focus on developing tourism in response to the possible permanent closure of the Christmas Island phosphate mine. • Review and implementation of the Christmas Island Destination Development Report in consultation with Tourism Australia; and examining the feasibility of applying a short stay tourist visa waiver program for the IOTs. • Establishment of economic development officers located within the IOTs Shires; and implementation of a practical, administrative complaints handling mechanism at the local level. • Providing discretionary grant approval authority to the IOTs Economic Development Consultative Groups in regard to the Economic Development Funding Program (EDFP); streamlining the application process under the EDFP; and doubling the EDFP to $ 150 000 per annum for each of the IOTs. • Support for the continuation of the Government’s partial subsidisation of domestic <b>air</b> services; lifting <b>cabotage</b> restrictions; and subsidisation of sea freight and shipping services to the IOTs. • Review of the application of the Australian Broadband Guarantee to the IOTs; subsidisation of the upgrade to the satellite link servicing the IOTs; and urgent upgrades to the mobile telephony network. • Examining alternative sources of renewable energy; and incorporating risk assessment relating to climate change into business proposals. • Review of building codes applied to the IOTs; drafting and implementation of land release and development plans for the IOTs; and ownership transfer to the Shire of housing at the former Quarantine Station site on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.   Image: Christmas Island pier, ニコール (Nicole M) / Flickr    ...|$|R
