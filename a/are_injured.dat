5|$|September 12, 1960– Hurricane Donna {{moves across}} the Outer Banks, causing heavy damage from the {{combination}} of high winds and waves. Up to a distance of 50miles (80km) inland, strong winds down trees and crops, and damage in the state totals $56.5million (1960USD, $422million 2008USD). Across the state, over 100people <b>are</b> <b>injured,</b> and eight people are killed, of which five directly.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{distress}} signal, the TARDIS lands {{aboard a}} 17th-century pirate ship {{stranded in the}} middle of an ocean. The ship's crew have been terrorised by a Siren-like creature (Lily Cole) who marks people with black spots on their palms after they <b>are</b> <b>injured.</b> Her song then lulls victims into a trance, making them want to go to her, which apparently disintegrates them. Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) receives a cut during a tussle with the pirates, and finds a black spot on his hand, but is prevented from succumbing to the song of the Siren by Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and the Doctor (Matt Smith).|$|E
5|$|Katie is also {{patron of}} Fair Trees, the {{organisation}} {{that is trying}} to stop exploitation of cone pickers in Ambrolauri, Georgia, by the European Christmas tree industry. The local people in this region of Georgia are paid a pittance to risk their lives climbing 30m high fir trees to collect the cones from which the seeds are extracted and sent to Christmas tree nurseries in Europe. Until Fair Trees came along these cone pickers were given no safety equipment or training, no health insurance and very little pay; every year people <b>are</b> <b>injured</b> and even killed doing this work. Fair Trees grow and sell the only fair trade Christmas trees in the world (certified by the WFTO).|$|E

5|$|Manta {{rays are}} subject to other {{anthropogenic}} threats. Because mantas must swim constantly to flush oxygen-rich water over their gills, they are vulnerable to entanglement and subsequent suffocation. Mantas cannot swim backwards and, because of their protruding cephalic fins, are prone to entanglement in fishing lines, nets, and even loose mooring lines. When snared, mantas often attempt to free themselves by somersaulting, tangling themselves further. Loose, trailing line can wrap around and cut its way into its flesh, resulting in irreversible injury. Similarly, mantas become entangled in gill nets designed for smaller fish. Some mantas <b>are</b> <b>injured</b> by collision with boats, especially in areas where they congregate and are easily observed. Other threats or factors that may affect manta numbers are climate change, tourism, pollution from oil spills, and the ingestion of microplastics.|$|E
5|$|Rick {{discovers the}} {{residents}} of Terminus engage in cannibalism, but the group manage to destroy Terminus and reunite. Some <b>are</b> <b>injured</b> and kidnapped to Grady, a hospital run by corrupt cops and doctors. When everybody regroups, they are approached by Aaron, inviting them to join a fortified community called Alexandria. The group are initially welcomed, but as the residents have not faced the zombie threat directly, Rick's group starts to take charge. Morgan, who has been searching for Rick, arrives and is shocked to see Rick killing an Alexandrian, who has been abusing his wife, in anger.|$|E
5|$|Some {{solar power}} plants with power tower designs in the Mojave Desert have come under {{scrutiny}} for bird mortality. In general, these facilities are fenced off to help keep terrestrial wildlife out. However, {{in the case of}} concentrated {{solar power plants}} such as the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, studies have concluded that a significant number of birds and bats <b>are</b> <b>injured</b> or killed either by colliding into the heliostat mirrors or from burning in solar flux created by the mirror field. Also, roadrunners become trapped outside the installed perimeter fences, where they become easy prey for coyotes, who have killed and eaten dozens of them since the facilities have been constructed.|$|E

2500|$|... 18 December 1973: the IRA {{carried out}} a series of attacks in London. In one attack, two police {{officers}} <b>were</b> <b>injured</b> in an explosion in Ronan Way. More than fifty <b>were</b> <b>injured</b> (two seriously) when a bomb exploded on Thorney Street (an inaccurate telephone warning was called in), and six others <b>were</b> <b>injured</b> when a bomb exploded at a postal sorting office.|$|R
5|$|Strict Jains don't eat root {{vegetables}} such as potatoes, onions, roots and tubers. This is so because tiny life forms <b>are</b> <b>injured</b> when {{the plant is}} pulled up and because the bulb {{is seen as a}} living being, as it is able to sprout. Also, consumption of most {{root vegetables}} involves uprooting and killing the entire plant, in contrast to consumption of most other terrestrial vegetables, upon which the plant lives on after plucking the vegetables (or it was seasonally supposed to wither away anyway). Mushrooms, fungi and yeasts are forbidden because they are parasites, grow in non-hygienic environments, and may harbour other life forms. Alfalfa is the only known plant that contains vitamin D2, which they may use directly or make vitamin D2 supplements from. Honey is forbidden, as its collection would amount to violence against the bees.|$|E
5|$|In 1975 the U.S. DOT {{conservatively}} {{identified a}} 0.7% reduction in traffic fatalities during DST, and estimated the real reduction at 1.5% to 2%, but the 1976 NBS {{review of the}} DOT study found no differences in traffic fatalities. In 1995 the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety estimated a reduction of 1.2%, including a 5% reduction in crashes fatal to pedestrians. Others have found similar reductions. Single/Double Summer Time (SDST), a variant where clocks are one hour ahead of the sun in winter and two in summer, has been projected to reduce traffic fatalities by 3% to 4% in the UK, compared to ordinary DST. However, accidents do increase {{by as much as}} 11% during the two weeks that follow the end of British Summer Time. It is not clear whether sleep disruption contributes to fatal accidents immediately after the spring clock shifts. A correlation between clock shifts and traffic accidents has been observed in North America and the UK but not in Finland or Sweden. If this effect exists, it is far smaller than the overall reduction in traffic fatalities. A 2009 U.S. study found that on Mondays after the switch to DST, workers sleep an average of 40 minutes less, and <b>are</b> <b>injured</b> at work more often and more severely.|$|E
5|$|September 15, 1999– Hurricane Floyd {{parallels}} {{the shore of}} the Delmarva Peninsula as a tropical storm. Chestertown, reports a maximum rainfall total of 14inches (350mm), with other locales reporting similar values. Extreme river flooding causes moderate damage to bridges and roads, resulting in a damage toll of $7.9million (1999USD, $10million 2008USD) throughout the state. In addition, over 250,000 residents are without electricity because of high winds blowing down power lines. More than 28people are forced to be rescued by boat as a result of severe flooding. Nine other people were from an apartment building near Great Mills. Two people <b>are</b> <b>injured</b> and one person is killed by carbon monoxide after losing power and running a generator inside their home. Also, a 12‑year-old boy is caught in flood waters and is swept a half mile (800m) down a drainage ditch before being rescued and treated for hypothermia.|$|E
50|$|The United States {{accused the}} Iraqi {{government}} of putting {{prices on the}} killing of foreigners in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq. The month before Schmidt's murder, two Swedish reporters <b>were</b> <b>injured</b> after a bomb exploded in their empty car and two Czechs and two Austrians <b>were</b> <b>injured</b> by other attacks. Two other UN guards <b>were</b> <b>injured</b> two days after Schmidts murder.|$|R

5|$|The {{black vulture}} {{can be held}} in captivity, though the Migratory Bird Treaty Act only allows this {{in the case of}} animals which <b>are</b> <b>injured</b> or unable to return to the wild. It {{receives}} special legal protections under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 in the United States, by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds in Canada, and by the Convention for the Protection of Migratory Birds and Game Mammals in Mexico. In the United States it is illegal to take, kill, or possess black vultures and violation of the law is punishable by a fine of up to US$15,000 and imprisonment of up to six months. It is listed as a species of Least Concern by the IUCN Red List. Populations appear to remain stable, and it has not reached the threshold of inclusion as a threatened species, which requires a decline of more than 30% in ten years or three generations.|$|E
