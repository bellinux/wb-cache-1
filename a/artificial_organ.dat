25|$|An <b>artificial</b> <b>organ</b> is a {{man-made}} device that is implanted or {{integrated into a}} human to replace a natural organ, {{for the purpose of}} restoring a specific function or a group of related functions so the patient may return to a normal life as soon as possible. The replaced function doesn't necessarily have to be related to life support, but often is. The ultimate goal of tissue engineering as a discipline is to allow both 'off the shelf' bioartificial organs and regeneration of injured tissue in the body. In order to successfully create bioartificial organs from a patients stem cells, researchers continue to make improvements in the generation of complex tissues by tissue engineering. For example, much research is aimed at understanding nanoscale cues present in a cell’s microenvironment.|$|E
25|$|Motivated by his {{personal}} experience with the disease, Ommaya focused {{on the problem of}} transplantation of islet cells for the treatment of diabetes. A major challenge facing survival of islet cells is immune rejection. Ommaya thought that the CSF would provide an ideal setting for transplanted islets due to the immune protection provided by the blood-brain barrier. He developed an <b>artificial</b> <b>organ</b> which would house transplanted islets, and the cells could be nourished by the CSF. Ayub, Illani Atwater, and colleagues identified that ventricular-peritoneal CSF shunts provided an immune protected site for the transplantation of mouse and rat islets in dogs and llamas. Ayub and colleagues also identified that CSF glucose mirrors blood glucose. Islets cells were able to survive in this system and function in the llama model, but further work on the model is needed.|$|E
500|$|Doctors had an {{artificial}} kidney {{rushed to the}} hospital for him, but the <b>artificial</b> <b>organ</b> reduced his blood's ability to clot and he began to bleed internally. Despite this it is said that he asked assistant manager Jimmy Murphy [...] "What time is the kick off against Wolves, Jimmy? I mustn't miss that match". By 14 February, his condition was reported to have [...] "dramatically improved". However, on 19 February it was reported that he was [...] "sinking rapidly", with use of the artificial kidney machine developing into a [...] "vicious circle, gradually sapping his strength". Doctors were [...] "amazed" [...] at his fight for life, and the next day a [...] "very slight improvement" [...] in his condition was reported, but he died at 2:15a.m. on 21 February 1958. Hours before his death, by coincidence, a new issue of Charles Buchan's Football Monthly was published in the United Kingdom, with a photograph of a smiling Edwards on the cover.|$|E

40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} is reviving itself, adopting {{the concept of}} biomimetics of in vivo tissue development. A basic concept of developmental biology is the modularity of the tissue architecture according to which intermediates in tissue development constitute semiautonomous entities. Both engineering and nature have chosen the modular architecture to optimize the product or organism development and evolution. Bioartificial tissues {{do not have a}} modular architecture. On the contrary, <b>artificial</b> <b>organs</b> of modular architecture have been already developed in the field of <b>artificial</b> <b>organs.</b> Therefore the conceptual support of tissue engineering by the field of <b>artificial</b> <b>organs</b> becomes critical in its new endeavor of recapitulating in vitro the in vivo tissue development. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Because {{cells are}} very {{sensitive}} to nanotopographical features, optimization of surfaces in tissue engineering has pushed the frontiers towards implantation. Under the appropriate conditions, a carefully crafted 3-dimensional scaffold is used to direct cell seeds towards <b>artificial</b> <b>organ</b> growth. The 3-D scaffold incorporates various nanoscale factors that control the environment for optimal and appropriate functionality. The scaffold is an analog of the in vivo extracellular matrix in vitro, allowing for successful <b>artificial</b> <b>organ</b> growth by providing the necessary, complex biological factors in vitro. Additional advantages include the possibility of cell expression manipulation, adhesion, and drug delivery.|$|E
