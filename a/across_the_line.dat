5|$|On 15 January 1898, J. Johnstone, {{a member}} of the Whiteinch Harriers running club, was killed while {{attempting}} to run <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> west of the station. A small lead memorial stood on the spot for many years. The freight line saw near-disaster on 28 December 1932, when seventeen wagons laden with coal ran away on a slight incline on the sidings operated by the Great Western Steam Laundry; they ran into other wagons, derailing nine and spilling coal over the line, seriously disrupting passenger traffic.|$|E
5|$|The first castle on the Thetford {{site was}} Red Castle and was {{probably}} built {{shortly after the}} Norman conquest of England by William de Warenne, the Earl of Surrey. The castle was a ringwork design and was positioned <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of the defensive Saxon ditch, in the process enclosing and cutting off the local church {{from the inside of}} the town, and building over part of the local cemetery.|$|E
5|$|All but Daniel Ricciardo {{did their}} first run in Q3 on used tyres {{in order to}} save a set for the race, with Hamilton fastest yet again. When the cars came around for their second and final timed laps, Ricciardo crossed the line first ahead of the Ferrari drivers, with Vettel going faster than {{teammate}} Räikkönen. When the two Mercedes came <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> last, Hamilton took his fourth consecutive pole position, while Nico Rosberg had to settle for third on the grid, not being able to beat Vettel's time. The two Williams cars filled the third row, while Nico Hülkenberg was delighted with eighth on the grid.|$|E

5|$|As of 1994, {{the line}} was intact and {{operational}} from Ganddal to Foss-Eigeland and the cement factory there. Here, an internal crane track has been welded <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> From Foss-Eigeland to Figgjo, the track is intact. At Figgjo, a bridge has been demolished, {{and it is not}} possible to traverse that section. Except for a number of level crossings where the tracks have been asphalted over, the line remains intact to Ålgård. At Ålgård Station the tracks have been removed, but the station building and depot remains. The station at Foss-Eigeland has been converted to a church, while the station at Figgjo had been taken over by a wholesaler. The line has officially been closed, but has not been abandoned. The Norwegian National Rail Administration retains ownership and can in the future renovate the line for operation.|$|E
5|$|Bradman’s batsmen {{set about}} {{building}} on their lead and Lindwall was initially {{not expected to}} bat; the Australian captain was expected to declare just before lunch {{on the fourth day}} so he could attack the English openers for a short period before the adjournment, but a shower deterred him from doing so, as his bowlers would have struggled to grip the ball. Lindwall had also been injured on a slippery surface in earlier times. Lindwall came to the crease to join Miller with Australia at 5/416 on the fourth afternoon. They attacked at every opportunity before the declaration. Miller fell and Lindwall ran out of his crease in attempt to hit Laker <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to the boundary. He missed and was stumped for 25. This prompted Bradman to declare at 7/460 immediately upon his dismissal, leaving England to chase a world record 596 for victory.|$|E
5|$|Despite Dire's greater {{experience}} {{over long}} distances, it was Kiplagat who forged {{ahead in the}} last kilometre and she won the race with ten seconds to spare over her Ethiopian rival. Arusei was the third <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> half a minute later, while Feyse Tadese, Joyce Chepkirui, Meseret Mengistu and Fate Tola took places 4–7 around one minute behind the winner. It was Arusei's clear third place which proved {{the difference between the}} top African teams, as Kenya won the team gold by a margin of 34 seconds over Ethiopia. A strong final phase saw Zhu Xiaolin take eighth place for the hosts, which was the best non-African individual performance that year. Japan's Yoshimi Ozaki and Ryoko Kizaki were immediately behind her, failing to get a top eight finish but yet again leading the country to the team bronze with a buffer of over six minutes between them and Australia.|$|E

50|$|The first combat with enemy {{aircraft}} {{took place}} on 16 August during a photographic mission <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines.</b> While <b>the</b> observer was taking photographs, the plane was attacked by a German aircraft. In the combat that ensued, the pilot was wounded {{three times in the}} leg and <b>the</b> aircraft fuel <b>line</b> was severed by a bullet causing the engine to stall. It was only the skillful piloting of the wounded pilot who managed to make an un-powered glide back <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines.</b> For his actions, the pilot was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross, he was taken to a hospital but re-joined the squadron later.|$|R
5|$|In the 2015 Tour of Qatar, three {{different}} jerseys were awarded. The {{first of these}} was the general classification. It was calculated by adding together the times recorded in each stage of the race, then making adjustments {{to take account of}} bonus seconds won for stage victories and intermediate sprints in the road stages (the winner of the individual time trial did not receive bonus seconds). The winner of each stage received a ten-second bonus; the rider coming second received a six-second bonus; the third rider <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> received a four-second bonus. Similarly, the winner, second-placed and third-placed riders in intermediate sprints won three-, two- and one-second bonuses respectively. If two riders were tied on the same time, the precise time (to one-hundredths of a second) recorded in the time trial would have been used to separate the riders. The leader of the general classification wore a gold jersey and the winner of the competition is considered the overall winner of the race.|$|E
5|$|Lad: A Dog was {{published}} by Dutton in April 1919, {{a year after the}} real-life Lad's death. Terhune continued receiving royalties for the novel up through his own death. His wife, Anice Terhune, ceased receiving the royalties after she surrendered the rights to them, along with those of Bruce and His Dog in exchange for E.P. Dutton agreeing to publish and perpetually print her work <b>Across</b> <b>the</b> <b>Line,</b> a supposed set of conversations she had with her late husband. With this agreement, Dutton became sole owners of the copyright to Lad: A Dog. Macrae later decided that the agreement was not completely fair to Anice and modified it to provide her a payment of $100 a month {{for the rest of her}} life, likely exceeding the profits they earned on the novels as the years passed.|$|E
5|$|The MCC {{match was}} {{followed}} by Australia's first non-victory of the tour, against Lancashire. Australia were sent in to bat and dismissed for 204, with Bradman bowled by an arm ball from Malcolm Hilton for 11, his first score on the tour below 80. The hosts replied with 182 {{and in the second}} innings, Bradman was again dismissed by Hilton, this time for 43 as the tourists reached 4/259 at the end of play. When Hilton came on, Bradman attempted to seize the initiative and hit him out of the attack, but missed his first two balls. On the third ball, he charged out of his crease and swung <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> missed, fell over and was stumped. Hilton's achievement garnered widespread press attention, particularly in Lancashire.|$|E

5|$|The second {{classification}} was {{the points}} classification. Riders received points for finishing {{among the highest}} placed in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type. In the 2010 Tour, stages classified flat had three intermediate sprint points worth 6, 4, and 2 points to the first three riders <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> For 2011, flat stages had just one intermediate sprint which was worth 20 points to the rider in first position, and the first 15 score points. The intention was to have riders needing to sprint twice during the day to score well. Points awarded at the finish of flat stages also increased, from 35 points for the winner to 45. Medium mountain stages awarded 30 points to the winner, high mountain stages and the individual time trial gave 20 points. No points were awarded for the team time trial on stage two. The leader was identified by a green jersey.|$|E
5|$|The {{team had}} a solid showing at the {{traditional}} opener to the French cycling season, the Grand Prix d'Ouverture La Marseillaise. While 's Jérémy Roy easily won the race with a solo breakaway, Gautier rode to sixth place by finishing {{near the front of}} the peloton two and a half minutes behind. At Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne, one of the early-season Belgian races, Chavanel also turned in a sixth place, in a large field sprint. That same day, Gautier secured a podium finish at Les Boucles du Sud Ardèche, coming third in a selective 12-rider sprint {{at the front of the}} race. Chavanel rode to eighth place at Le Samyn, coming <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> 11 seconds back of the winner Dominic Klemme in a race decided by a late breakaway.|$|E
5|$|Yet another {{structure}} {{available is}} λ/2 open-circuit stubs <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> coupled with λ/4 impedance transformers. This topology has both low-pass and band-pass characteristics. Because {{it will pass}} DC, {{it is possible to}} transmit biasing voltages to active components without the need for blocking capacitors. Also, since short-circuit links are not required, no assembly operations other than the board printing are required when implemented as stripline. The disadvantages are (i) the filter will take up more board real estate than the corresponding λ/4 stub filter, since the stubs are all twice as long; (ii) the first spurious passband is at 2ω0, as opposed to 3ω0 for the λ/4 stub filter.|$|E

5|$|After the {{resumption}} of play, Brown was caught behind from Coxon for 32 without adding to his lunch score, ending an 87-run partnership with Miller, and bringing Lindwall to the crease at 416/5. Miller and Lindwall attacked at every opportunity before the declaration. Miller's innings was noted for its driving, and he was out for 74, playing a hook shot that was caught by Bedser at square leg from Laker in pursuit of quick runs. He was followed by Lindwall, who ran out of his crease in attempt to hit Laker <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to the boundary, missed, and was stumped for 25, prompting Bradman to declare with Australia at 460/7 with a lead of 595 runs. The tourists had added 51 runs {{for the loss of}} three wickets in approximately an hour's batting after lunch. Yardley and Laker had been the only multiple wicket-takers, with two each. The Australians had punished the spinners the most, taking more than 3.50 runs per over from each of Wright, Laker and Compton. It would take a world record chase from England to win the match.|$|E
5|$|He then struck 114 as {{his state}} {{defeated}} the tourists by an innings, {{and he made}} 40 and a duck as the Australians took the series lead in the Second Test. He made 70 and 71 in the Third Test loss in Sydney, {{one of the few}} players able to combat Lance Gibbs effectively, top-scoring in the first innings and second top-scoring in the second innings. He then made 65 in the second innings in the Fourth Test at Adelaide, where Australia held on by one wicket for a draw. He contributed 48 in the second innings of the Fifth Test as Australia appeared headed for a series victory. However, a late collapse ensued, and Australia scraped home by two wickets to take the series 2–1. O'Neill ended the series with 522 runs at 52.20. O'Neill gained attention during the summer for frequently losing his wicket by impulsively sweeping. This was attributed to the dominance of his bottom hand, which saw his bat swinging <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of flight of the ball. Despite the criticism, he was {{at the peak of his}} international career, having made 1398 runs at 58.35 in his first 18 Tests.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{plans for}} the station were for access to be from Monmouth Road, which runs {{parallel}} to the railway, north of the line. There {{was to be a}} fully accessible footbridge <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> with both ramp and stairs, as well as a pedestrian crossing across Monmouth Road and a lit 50-space car park on the old goods yard at the eastern end of Monmouth Road. The very end of the goods yard would be maintained for Network Rail access. These plans were changed following an agreement to acquire a property on Station Road. The new plans have the entrance to be on Station Road, at the east end of the site, meaning there would be no need for a footbridge. There would be disabled parking and a pick up/drop off point adjacent to the entrance, although the exact design of this area is still under consideration. Noise mitigation options are to be investigated and there will be improvements to local footpaths. The line is due to reopen in 2020.|$|E

5|$|Standing {{six feet}} tall, O'Neill was {{compared}} to Don Bradman upon his entry into Test cricket. At his best, he was a dynamic stroke maker who was a crowd favourite because {{of his ability to}} score at a high pace, in particular with his power off the back foot. He was noted for his nimble footwork, which he used to negate spin bowling; however this slowed in his later career as he put on weight. O'Neill particularly liked to sweep the slower bowlers. He often put too much emphasis on his right hand, allowing a large space between his hands on the bat handle, and then turning his right shoulder too square towards the bowler. The renowned English batsman and captain Wally Hammond said that O'Neill was the best all-round batsman he had seen since World War II. O'Neill's tall build, strength and good looks also drew comparison to his boyhood idol Keith Miller. Despite the comparisons to Bradman, O'Neill was much taller and broader, and was often impetuous whereas Bradman was known for his patience and lack of rashness. O'Neill was also criticised for hitting <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> early in his innings.|$|E
5|$|The next day's {{stage was}} preceded by a minute's silence, and ridden as a {{procession}} in Weylandt's memory. In keeping with convention, there was no competitive racing. Each of the 23 teams took {{to the front of}} the peloton for about 15 minutes, and the remaining Leopard Trek squad, along with Farrar, were allowed to finish first with their arms around each other. Millar led the rest of the field <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> a few seconds later. No results for the stage were recorded, and it did not count towards the general classification or any of the points competitions. After the stage, instead of any podium presentations, the four jersey classification leaders (Millar, Alessandro Petacchi, Gianluca Brambilla, and Jan Bakelants) appeared on stage with the Leopard Trek team to lead another moment of silence. Subsequently, Farrar and the remaining Leopard Trek squad all decided to leave the race. Feillu did not want to leave the Giro, feeling that continuing to race would have been the best way to honor Weylandt, but he did not mind acquiescing to his teammates' will. For most of them, the decision was based on a desire to attend Weylandt's funeral, which took place nine days after his death. Members of the Giro squad served as pallbearers. Other teammates, as well as Farrar, members of Weylandt's former team , and Giro director Angelo Zomegnan were all in attendance, along with hundreds of cycling fans assembled outside the chapel.|$|E
5|$|In {{his fourth}} over, Lindwall had Washbrook caught behind for eight after needlessly playing at a ball wide outside off stump. Before lunch, Lindwall bowled six overs and took 1/7, while Bill Johnston {{accompanied}} {{him from the}} other end because Keith Miller had a back injury and was only able to bat. Neither Hutton nor Washbrook appeared comfortable against the bowling, and the new batsman Bill Edrich tried to hit Lindwall through the off side, leading to a loud appeal for caught behind, which was turned down. After the lunch break, Hutton fell, and Compton came in, having been dismissed hit wicket after falling over in the First Test while trying to avoid a bouncer. Lindwall delivered a few short balls straight away, but the new batsman was not caught off-guard. Lindwall then clean bowled Bill Edrich—who was playing <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of the ball—for five. Tom Dollery was the new batsman and stopped the first ball with his pads before Lindwall’s next delivery broke through his defences and hit the stumps to send him back to the pavilion for a duck. Dollery's bat was about to start its downward swing by the time Lindwall's outswinger had passed him and hit the stumps. O'Reilly said that Dollery's inability to deal with Lindwall was typical of English cricket's lack of answers to express pace bowling. This was part of a six-over post-lunch spell of 2/11 by Lindwall; the batsmen appeared unable to deal with his swing and extreme pace. England were 4/46 and Australia firmly in control, but the home side were given some respite when both Lindwall and Johnston were taken out of the attack. Australia had the option of taking the new ball just before the tea break, but Bradman decided to wait so his two pacemen could have an extra 20 minutes to replenish their energy levels.|$|E
