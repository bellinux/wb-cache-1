5|$|Soon {{after their}} accession, William and Mary rewarded John Churchill by {{granting}} him the Earldom of Marlborough and Prince George was made Duke of Cumberland. Anne requested {{the use of}} Richmond Palace and a parliamentary allowance. William and Mary refused the first, and unsuccessfully opposed the latter, both of which caused {{tension between the two}} sisters. Anne's resentment grew worse when William refused to allow Prince George to serve in the military in an <b>active</b> <b>capacity.</b> The new king and queen feared that Anne's financial independence would weaken their influence over her and allow her to organise a rival political faction. From around this time, at Anne's request she and Sarah Churchill, Lady Marlborough, began to call each other the pet names Mrs. Morley and Mrs. Freeman respectively, to facilitate a relationship of greater equality between the two when they were alone. In January 1692, suspecting that Marlborough was secretly conspiring with James's followers, the Jacobites, William and Mary dismissed him from all his offices. In a public show of support for the Marlboroughs, Anne took Sarah to a social event at the palace, and refused her sister's request to dismiss Sarah from her household. Lady Marlborough was subsequently removed from the royal household by the Lord Chamberlain, and Anne angrily left her royal lodgings and took up residence at Syon House, the home of the Duke of Somerset. Anne was stripped of her guard of honour; courtiers were forbidden to visit her, and civic authorities were instructed to ignore her. In April, Anne gave birth to a son who died within minutes. Mary visited her, but instead of offering comfort took the opportunity to berate Anne once again for her friendship with Sarah. The sisters never saw each other again. Later that year, Anne moved to Berkeley House in Piccadilly, London, where she had a stillborn daughter in March 1693.|$|E

30|$|The {{anchorage}} structure {{fails to}} form the active bearing as soon as possible. The key for the active control of the soft roadway support {{is to improve the}} residual strength of loose rocks to give full play to the <b>active</b> bearing <b>capacity</b> of the surrounding rocks. Mine pressure observation shows that the cable can achieve a pretension of 100  kN, while the bolt has a pretension force of 30 – 40  kN generally. Therefore, the shallow anchoring structure formed by bolt and surrounding rocks present insufficient <b>active</b> bearing <b>capacity.</b> Moreover, the cable support is generally lagged behind of heading end by certain distance. The anchoring structure formed by the bolt, cable, the surrounding rocks fail to control intense surrounding rock deformation due to the insufficient overall <b>active</b> bearing <b>capacity</b> at the initial stage of the excavation. Therefore, serious deformation of the surrounding rocks appears and calls for repeated maintenances.|$|R

40|$|Jackson (2000) {{proposes a}} 'rematerialization' {{of social and}} {{cultural}} geography. He argues for the grounding of geographical analysis in the concrete world of actual physical objects. Examining the work of Jackson (2000) and Miller (1987, 1998) this paper interrogates this return to the physical. In particular, this paper argues that current articulations of physicality rely on a universal metaphysics of matter [...] positing matter as a universally undifferentiated conditionality. This reliance is problematic in that it signifies an essentialist dichotomy between the objective (the material) and the subjective (the textual). Also this dichotomy necessitates a linear dialectics of matter subjugating the material to the determinative action of form. In subjecting Jackson's notion of rematerialization to a critical philosophical reading, the aim is to disturb the unquestioned metaphysical implications of this return. Indeed it is to suggest that a rematerialization {{of social and cultural}} geography must account for the wayward expressiveness of matter [...] its representative and <b>active</b> <b>capacities</b> outside its relation with the subject...|$|R

40|$|Ensuring {{predictability}} is {{a crucial}} goal for service systems. Traditionally, {{research has focused on}} designing systems that ensure predictable performance for service requests. Motivated by applications in cloud computing and electricity markets, this article focuses on a different form of predictability: predictable allocations of service capacity. The focus of the article is a new model where service capacity can be scaled dynamically and service deferrals (subject to deadline constraints) can be used to control the variability of the <b>active</b> service <b>capacity.</b> Four natural policies for the joint problem of scheduling and managing the <b>active</b> service <b>capacity</b> are considered. For each, the variability of service capacity and the likelihood of deadline misses are derived. Further, the paper illustrates how pricing can be used to provide incentives for jobs to reveal deadlines and thus enable the possibility of service deferral in systems where the flexibility of jobs is not known to the system a priori...|$|R
