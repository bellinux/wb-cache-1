40|$|High Energy Physics Experiments {{carried out}} at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) at Geneva, require {{manufacturing}} and operation of very complex devices, which demand solutions and challenging synergies to very complex and problematic conditions. These devices operating at CERN need an effective monitoring system to prevent damages which {{can be caused by}} many different factors, such as: very high or very low temperature, high magnetic fields and induced mechanical strain, irradiation, electromagnetic interferences, humidity and so on. Traditional sensing systems based on electronic sensor several time present serious drawbacks in such harsh environmental conditions, in particular for the presence of very intense electromagnetic fields generating high noise levels. Moreover the concomitant presence of very high level of irradiation imposes the Radiation Hardness Capability as one fundamental requirement for the sensors to be employed. Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) optical sensors offer an immediate solution for all these issues: in particular their immunity to electromagnetic noise factor make them clearly preferable with respect to the traditional electronic sensors for High Energy Physics (HEP) applications. Compactness, intrinsic multiplexing (also many tens of sensors can be mounted on the a single optical fiber), long term stable and reliable behavior, multi-parameter sensitivity (commercial sensors detect Mechanical Strain and Temperature, prototypes presented in present thesis detect relative humidity and cryogenic temperatures), reduction of instrumentation and improvement of the workplace safety are further fundamental advantages of the FBGs to be taken in consideration in the future design choices for sensing network in the LHC accelerator and detectors. In present thesis, the suitability of <b>Active</b> <b>Coated</b> FBG sensors for Cryogenic Temperature monitoring in the LHC infrastructures and for Relative Humidity measures in the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at CERN is demonstrated.

40|$|In this work, an Al 2 O 3 -coated SiC foam {{monolith}} {{was used}} as the support of a Ni-based catalyst, which was applied for coupling partial oxidation and steaming reforming of methane to produce syngas or hydrogen. This monolithic catalyst showed excellent structural stability in a 900 h endurance test. Its catalytic activity and stability were also excellent during the first 500 h of the endurance test with a CH 4 conversion (similar to 96 %) near thermodynamic equilibrium. Subsequently, it deactivated gradually and its activity was reduced by 7 % in the following 400 h. This deactivation is ascribed to deposited carbon that originated from methane cracking in {{the upper part of the}} stainless steel reactor. Fresh and used catalyst samples were characterized by XRD, BET, SEM and XRF methods. The results showed that the <b>active</b> <b>coating</b> consisting of Al 2 O 3, and the components loaded on it was partially dislodged from the SiC substrate during the reaction, but the loss of Ni loaded on the Al 2 O 3 coating was less than the loss of Al 2 O 3. This is ascribed to most Ni species being located on the outer surface of the monolithic support, which was more weakly corroded by the reactant flow. The shrinkage of the <b>active</b> <b>coating</b> and the sintering of nickel particles were also observed in the endurance test. Moreover, the SiC foam supported Ni-based monolithic catalyst showed a more homogeneous bed temperature distribution compared with a traditional Ni/Mg-Al spinel catalyst. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
