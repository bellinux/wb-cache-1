The article reviews the dependence of adaptation on the climate of the Indian State the students come from, of the peculiarities of feeding of Indian students. The problem of Indian students’ health maintaining is observed and it is determined by optimization of adaptation terms. For this purpose antropometric and thermometric investigations of 173 Indian students in comparison with 60 Russian students were made. The investigation of the students was realized in autumn and spring periods.

40|$|Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a widely-spread {{mycotoxin}} {{all over}} the world causing major health risks. The focus of the present review is on the molecular and cellular interactions of OTA. In order to get better insight into the mechanism of its toxicity and on the several attempts made for prevention or attenuation of its toxic action, a detailed description is given on chemistry and toxicokinetics of this mycotoxin. The mode of action of OTA is not clearly understood yet, and seems to be very complex. Inhibition of protein synthesis and energy production, induction of oxidative stress, DNA adduct formation, as well as apoptosis/necrosis and cell cycle arrest are possibly involved in its toxic action. Since OTA binds very strongly to human and <b>animal</b> <b>albumin,</b> a major emphasis is done regarding OTA-albumin interaction. Displacement of OTA from albumin by drugs and by natural flavonoids are discussed in detail, hypothesizing their potentially beneficial effect in order to prevent or attenuate the OTA-induced toxic consequences...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Intrinsic hepatic {{clearance}} (K) of indocyanine green (ICG) {{is used as}} {{a quantitative}} measure of liver function. ICG is tightly bound to plasma proteins. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the effect of changes of plasma protein concentration on K. in anaesthetized pigs with intact hepatic circulation. In addition, an attempt was made to evaluate the corresponding changes of the unbound intrinsic clearance of ICG. The plasma protein concentration was changed by exchange of plasma with either dextran‐ 70 or donor pig plasma. Plasma albumin concentration was measured in a peripheral artery and changes of the concentrations of other plasma proteins were assumed to parallel those of albumin. ICG was given as a constant infusion and K was calculated from peripheral artery and hepatic vein concentrations of ICG according to the sinusoidal perfusion model. One experimental series comprised 3 measurement periods: From Period 1 to Period 2 (eight <b>animals)</b> <b>albumin</b> concentration was decreased by 36. 6 ± 6. 5 % (Mean±SD). This was associated with an increase of K of 32. 8 ± 28. 8 % (P= 0. 004). From Period 2 to 3 (five <b>animals)</b> <b>albumin</b> was increased by 13. 2 ± 3. 2 % and K decreased by 18. 5 ± 8. 3 % (P= 0. 03). In the second experimental series (eight <b>animals),</b> <b>albumin</b> concentration was increased by 21. 6 ± 10. 3 % and K decreased by 20. 3 ± 8. 1 % (P= 0. 001). For both series, changes in albumin concentration were associated with oppositely directed changes of K in 20 out of 21 comparisons (P < 0. 001). Thus K depends not only on hepatocyte function but also on plasma protein concentration. This finding should affect interpretation of K when used as a liver function test. Changes of the unbound intrinsic clearance of ICG were examined indirectly by means of the K · a product (a: albumin concentration). According to the overall evaluation of the data the unbound intrinsic clearance of ICG was not affected by the changes in plasma protein concentration, but the results were internally inconsistent, apparently due to a time‐dependency of the K · a product. We suggest this to be due to a slow but steady decrease of the ‘background’ K. After correction for the average decrease of K of 0. 102 % per min our data were in accordance with the hypothesis that the unbound clearance of K was enhanced by the binding protein(s) of ICG.

40|$|Albumin, {{the major}} serum protein, binds {{a wide variety}} of {{lipophilic}} compounds including steroids, other lipophilic hormones and various phytochemicals and xenobiotics that bind to receptors for steroids and other lipophilic hormones. Despite albumin’s low affinity (Kd 104 M to 106 M) for these lipophilic compounds, the high concentration of albumin in serum makes this protein a major carrier of steroids and lipophilic hormones and a regulator of their access to receptors. Albumin also func-tions as a sink for xenobiotics, diminishing the binding of xenobiotics to hormone receptors and other cellular proteins. This protects animals from endocrine disruption by xenobiotics. We propose that these properties of albumin were important in protochordates and primitive vertebrates, such as jawless fish, about 600 to 530 million years ago, just before and during the Cambrian period. It is at that time that the ancestral receptors of adrenal and sex steroids- androgens, estrogens, glucocorticoids, mineralo-corticoids, and progestins- arose in multicellular <b>animals.</b> <b>Albumin</b> regulated access of steroids to their receptors, as well as protecting animals from endocrine disruptors, such as phytochemicals, fungal chemicals and phenolics, and other chemicals formed at hydrothermal vents by geo-chemical processes.

40|$|Many {{bactericide}} species express surface {{proteins that}} interact with human serum albumin (HSA). Protein PAB from the anaerobic bacterium Finegoldia magna (formerly Peptostreptococcus magnus) {{represents one of}} these proteins. Protein PAB contains a domain of 53 amino acid residues known as the GA module. GA homologs are also found in protein G of group C and G streptococci. Here we report the crystal structure of HSA in complex with the GA module of protein PAB. The model of the complex was refined to a resolution of 2. 7 Angstrom and reveals a novel binding epitope located in domain II of the albumin molecule. The GA module is composed of a left-handed three-helix bundle, and residues from the second helix and the loops surrounding it {{were found to be}} involved in HSA binding. Furthermore, the presence of HSA-bound fatty acids seems to influence HSA-GA complex formation.

40|$|Guinea pigs {{were used}} to {{determine}} whether immunization and challenge by toluene diisocyanate (TDI) induce changes in the serum protein concentrations of the "acute-phase response" and whether TDI can form adducts with serum proteins. METHODS: Guinea pigs were immunized by weekly intradermal injections of TDI and challenged with TDI 7 days after the 3 rd injection. The animals were killed 6 hours after the challenge, and serum was analyzed for protein characterization by gel electrophoresis and for specific antibodies to TDI by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blotting. RESULTS: The total serum protein concentration of the immunized TDI-challenged guinea pigs increased in comparison with that of nonimmunized animals [75 (SE 0. 7) versus 47. 4 (SE 2. 3) mg/ml;]. Albumin and alpha, and alpha 2 globulins increased significantly [respectively: 65. 8 (SE 0. 2) %, 2. 1 (SE 0. 1) % and 7. 2 (SE 0. 1) % versus 59 (SE 1. 3) %, 1. 3 (SE 0. 1) % and 3. 7 (SE 0. 1) %], whereas beta 1 and beta 2 globulins decreased in the immunized TDI-challenged guinea pigs [7. 8 (SE 0. 2) % and 0. 8 (SE 0. 2) % versus 15. 8 (SE 0. 7) % and 4. 8 (SE 0. 2) %]. The gamma globulin concentrations did not change significantly. In the immunized TDI-challenged <b>animals,</b> <b>albumin</b> was modified by TDI and ran faster on agarose gel electrophoresis than did albumin from nonimmunized guinea pigs. In the ELISA, only immunized animals had high titers of TDI-specific antibodies (IgG and IgG 1); by blotting, the antibodies reacted against TDI, the TDI-BSA-conjugate and several TDI-conjugated guinea pig serum proteins, but they did not react against any native or denaturated serum protein when unconjugated with TDI. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that, in guinea pigs, immunization and challenge with TDI induces changes in serum proteins of the "acute phase response" and TDI is adducted to serum proteins with different molecular weights (eg, albumin) ...|$|R

Both strains were studied after either sham-operation on a normal diet (Sham) or after unilateral nephrectomy and high NaCl loading (NX-NaCl) with 4 % NaCl in diet for 6 weeks. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) increased only in SHRSP-NX-NaCl compared to SHRSP-Sham. SBP remained unchanged in SHR-NX-NaCl compared to SHR-Sham. In SHRSP-NX-NaCl <b>animals</b> urinary <b>albumin</b> and ET- 1 excretion, renal ET- 1 mRNA expression, glomerulosclerosis index, and tubulointerstitial damage index were elevated compared to SHRSP-Sham while no significant changes were found in SHR after NX-NaCl, respectively.

In contrast, SHRSP-NX-NaCl developed a significantly more pronounced increase of ETA compared to ETB binding, resulting in a significant increase of ETA/ETB receptor ratio only in the SHRSP-NX-NaCl. Thus, activation of the renal ET-system together with an increased ETA/ETB receptor ratio may contribute to decreased UNa+ and development of SS-SH and kidney damage...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} on the identification of Fasciola spp. and their intermediate hosts, the general life cycle of Fasciola and aspects of the epidemiology, clinical signs, {{diagnosis and treatment of}} infections is reviewed. Two experiments were carried out. The first involved 18 weeks observations on 5 adult male goats each infected with 150 metacercartae of F. hepatica and 5 uninfected controls. The second involved groups of 10 sheep and 10 goats each infected with 200 metacercariae with 5 uninfected controls of each species. In both experiments, faecal, haematological, biochemical and pathological examinations were conducted. The animals were also weighed regularly. In the first experiment, although only 15 - 35 flukes were established, measurable and, in many cases, statistically significant changes in a variety of parameters were observed. A depression in packed cell volumes relative to controls of approximately 20 % occurred. Though haemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration levels remained within the normal ranges, erythrocyte levels in the infected group were significantly lower than in the controls and there was a tendency for the anaemia to become macrocytic. This suggests that goats may be particularly susceptible to the effects of blood loss associated with Fasciola infections though further work is needed to confirm this. A marked peripheral eosinophilia and elevation in fibrinogen levels were observed in infected <b>animals.</b> <b>Albumin</b> levels decreased, globulin levels increased and the A/G ratio decreased significantly relative to the control group but all levels remained within the normal ranges. In infected animals, gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) and glutamyl dehydrogenase (GD) levels rose to beyond the limits of the normal ranges although aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, which were also significantly elevated, did not. The results indicate that serum GD and GGT are particularly sensitive indicators of damage to the liver parenchyma and bile ducts caused by F. hepatica in goats and that GD is more sensitive than AST. Serum bile acids were estimated but no significant change was detected. The ratio between faecal egg counts and the numbers of adult flukes present at necropsy was consistently lower than described for sheep with a mean of approximately 13 epg/fluke (range 9 - 23) at the final sampling and 18 epg/fluke (range 11 - 29) in the previous week when the egg counts were highest. This is potentially of considerable diagnostic importance and needs further investigation. In the second experiment, the number of flukes established was extremely low in both species (mean 0. 85 % & 2. 95 % in the sheep and goats respectively) although more goats than sheep became infected. Pre-existing liver pathology in the sheep was a further complication. Consequently, little information of value was generated by the infection of goats and no data {{that could be used for}} comparative purposes were obtained from the sheep infection. However, combination of the data from the 13 infected goats from both experiments yielded some useful information in relation to serum enzyme levels. Correlations between the numbers of flukes recovered at necropsy and peak levels of serum enzymes and various haematological parameters in individual animals were examined though only those relating to enzyme levels were statistically significant. The correlation coefficients between peak enzyme levels and fluke numbers indicated that the relationship was strongest with GGT and weakest with AST. However, regression analysis showed that there was no predictive value in the relationship with any of the enzymes because of extremely wide confidence intervals for predicted fluke numbers...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Respiratory {{distress}} syndrome in preterm babies {{is caused}} by a pulmonary surfactant deficiency, but also by its inactivation due to various conditions, including plasma protein leakage. Surfactant replacement therapy is well established, but clinical observations and in vitro experiments suggested that its efficacy may be impaired by inactivation. A new synthetic surfactant (CHF 5633), containing synthetic surfactant protein B and C analogs, has shown comparable effects on oxygenation in ventilated preterm rabbits versus Poractant alfa, but superior resistance against inactivation in vitro. We hypothesized that CHF 5633 is also resistant to inactivation by serum albumin in vivo. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Nineteen preterm lambs of 127 days gestational age (term = 150 days) received CHF 5633 or Poractant alfa and were ventilated for 48 hours. Ninety minutes after birth, the <b>animals</b> received <b>albumin</b> with CHF 5633 or Poractant alfa. Animals received additional surfactant if P(a) O(2) dropped below 100 mmHg. A pressure volume curve was done post mortem and markers of pulmonary inflammation, surfactant content and biophysiology, and lung histology were assessed. CHF 5633 treatment resulted in improved arterial pH, oxygenation and ventilation efficiency index. The survival rate was significantly higher after CHF 5633 treatment (5 / 7) than after Poractant alfa (1 / 8) after 48 hours of ventilation. Biophysical examination of the surfactant recovered from bronchoalveolar lavages revealed that films formed by CHF 5633 -treated animals reached low surface tensions in a wider range of compression rates than films from Poractant alfa-treated animals. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time a synthetic surfactant containing both surfactant protein B and C analogs showed significant benefit over animal derived surfactant in an in vivo model of surfactant inactivation in premature lambs...|$|R

In rats with chronic uremia (blood urea nitrogen greater than 45 mg/ 100 ml 1 mo after surgical reduction in renal mass), cell-free protein synthesis is reduced 30 [...] 40 % in liver membrane-bound polyribosomes.

Amostras de sangue foram coletadas aos 3, 5, 10, 15, 17, 20, 22, 25, 30, 40, 50 e 60 dias de vida e analisadas quanto à concentração de proteína total e albúmina séricas. Os animais foram pesados ao nascer e aos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50 e 60 dias de idade. Os animais do tratamento 3 (colostro duas vezes/dia) tiveram concentração de proteína total sérica superior (p The serum {{total protein}} and albumin concentrations {{and the performance}} under different milk feeding programs were evaluated in twenty-four female Holstein newborn calves, randomly allocated in three treatments. The animals were daily fed milk or supplemental colostrum, in different feeding programs during the first thirty days of Ufe. Blood samples were collected at 3; 5; 10; 15; 17; 20; 22; 25; 30; 40; 50 and 60 days of age and analysed for serum total protein and serum <b>albumin.</b> <b>Animals</b> were weighed at 0; 5; 10; 15; 20; 25; 30; 40; 50 and 60 days after birth. In the first sixty days, the serum total protein concentration in treatment 3 (colostrum fed twice a day) was higher (p < 0. 05) than in treatment 1 (milk). The concentration of serum was also different at different ages (p < 0. 0001). During the experimental period the total protein decreased (equation r² = 0. 98). Serum albumin levels were similar at all ages, but different in treatments. Treatment 2 (colostrum fed once a day) levels were higher (p < 0. 05) than in treatment 1 for serum albumin. Treatment 3 body weight gain was higher (p < 0. 05) than in treatment 1 during the experimental period. It was concluded that the best performance was found in calves that received a supplemental colostrum diet twice a day...|$|R
40|$|Munich Wistar Frömter (MWF) rats {{represent}} a valuable animal model {{to investigate the}} development of hypertension and its cardiovascular and renal organ damage, as MWF animals develop mild hypertension and progressive albuminuria. Besides, MWF rats exhibit a sexual dimorphism in kidney damage with a more pronounced degree of albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis in males. A loss of podoplanin expression in podocytes is one possible pathophysiologic mechanism. Furthermore, the MWF strain develops an inborn nephron deficit, which can already be detected at embryonic day (E) 15. 5. In this study microarray gene expression analysis of embryonic rat kidneys was performed to identify candidate genes for the impaired nephron induction in MWF. Specific candidates were further analyzed by reverse transcription-qPCR at E 15. 5 as early-stage kidney, E 19. 0 as late-stage fetal kidney, and in week 4 when nephrogenesis is completed. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were used as reference strain after stage-matching at E 16. 0 and E 19. 5, respectively. Furthermore, the effect of testosterone {{on the development of}} albuminuria was investigated in male MWF rats. Adult animals were either orchiectomized (Ox), or orchiectomized and treated with both, testosterone and the androgen receptor antagonist flutamide (OxTF), and compared to sham-operated rats (Sham) by measuring the renal albumin excretion. Transcriptome analysis revealed 311 transcripts with significant expression differences between MWF and SHR. Seven genes were located on rat chromosome 6 that was previously linked to the development of albuminuria and nephron deficit in the MWF strain. Four genes were significantly upregulated in MWF (Abcg 5, Ab 1 - 233, Efcab 11, Gpx 2), and three genes were significantly downregulated (Fntb, Lrrn 3, Rtn 1). Gpx 2, encoding the glutathione peroxidase 2, seemed of special interest, as its expression in murine embryonic kidney was already reported. The testosterone study displayed a progressive development of albuminuria in MWF Sham <b>animals</b> with an <b>albumin</b> excretion of 48. 30 ± 6. 16 mg/ 24 h in 18 week old rats. After orchiectomy, albuminuria was reduced by more than 50 % compared with MWF Sham. In OxTF animals testosterone levels were higher after testosterone substitution than in the Sham group. However, androgen receptor blockade with flutamide further suppressed albuminuria to levels of 6. 40 ± 1. 19 mg/ 24 h. Furthermore, a molecular link between angiotensin II stimulation and reduced podoplanin expression was identified in cultured human podocytes. The current study revealed interesting candidates – molecular and hormonal – that could be involved in the pathogenesis of renal damage in the MWF strain. Further investigations are needed to clarify their specific functions and mechanisms...|$|R
