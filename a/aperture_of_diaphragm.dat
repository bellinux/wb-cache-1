40|$|Abstract: Recently, {{there has}} been a {{revolution}} in the world of microwave, and Gunn diode oscillators have found many applications and are also heavily applied in research and development in laboratories. These devices are often referred to as an oscillator with low and medium power and are used in microwave receivers. This paper introduces X-band oscillator Gunn diodes and discusses the design and implementation steps that are taken into consideration. The local oscillator of X band, sweeps 8. 5 to 9. 4 GHz frequency range with a short circuit plate movement across the cavity. Furthermore, change in <b>aperture</b> diameter <b>of</b> <b>diaphragm</b> to achieve maximum output power is examined. We observe that the change in <b>aperture</b> diameter <b>of</b> 8 to 9 mm, leads to 15 mW more output power to the amount that can be accounted as outstanding. To prevent damage to the diode, due to current fluctuations of a metal, applying a metal nut with high capacity is also investigated. Phase noise measuring, frequency stability with temperature and time and the second harmonic excitation are also the cases that have been studied. In order to protect Gunn diode in different biases a protection circuit has been designed...|$|R

[...] Francis Ronalds created an early electrograph around 1814 in which the changing electricity made a pattern in a rotating resin-coated plate. [...] It was employed at Kew Observatory and the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in the 1840s to create records of variations in atmospheric electricity. In 1845, Ronalds invented photographic means of registering the atmospheric electricity. [...] The photosensitive surface was pulled slowly past <b>of</b> the <b>aperture</b> <b>diaphragm</b> <b>of</b> the camera box, which also housed an electrometer, and captured ongoing movements of the electrometer indices as a trace. [...] Kelvin used similar photographic means for his quadrant electrometer (see above) in the 1860s.|$|R

This system first appeared in certain Perspective Control lenses, designated PC-E (with designs that preclude a mechanical linkage). E-type lenses aperture control is only supported by all DSLRs with CMOS image sensor except the Nikon D90. For all other cameras the lens aperture stays maximum open with normal autofocus and metering. E Lenses with manual aperture control like PC-E lenses allow manual diaphragm operation on all cameras, with possible unreliable metering on DSLRs without E-type support. Otherwise E lenses are similar to G lenses. Not {{to be confused with}} old AI Series E lenses.|$|R

40|$|White light {{scanning}} interference microscopy, {{with its}} high axial resolution, is particularly {{useful for the}} rapid 3 D characterization of MOEMS micro-systems. Although this technique {{can be used for}} submicron critical dimension measurement on micron high microelectronic structures, recent tests using a standard system have revealed errors of up to 3 µm in the measurement of lateral position of deep square steps. Thus the 2 µm wide, 75 µm deep teeth of an electrostatic comb structure in a FT MOEMS spectrometer were measured to be nearly 7 µm wide using a Mirau interference objective with the <b>aperture</b> <b>diaphragm</b> <b>of</b> the illumination system fully open in white light. Tests under different conditions show that the error is greatest for the Mirau objective, with the aperture diaphragm fully open at longer wavelengths. In addition, the location of the centre of such structures can vary by up to 1 µm depending on the degree of reference mirror tilt. Investigations of the XZ images of square steps have revealed the presence of "ghost" fringes resulting from diffraction and the conical illumination used.

50|$|An {{interesting}} forerunner to {{the movie}} camera was the machine invented by Francis Ronalds at the Kew Observatory in 1845. A photosensitive surface was drawn slowly past the <b>aperture</b> <b>diaphragm</b> <b>of</b> the camera by a clockwork mechanism to enable continuous recording over a 12- or 24-hour period. Ronalds applied his cameras to trace the ongoing variations of scientific instruments and they were used in observatories {{around the world for}} over a century. The very first patented film camera was the one devised by Wordsworth Donisthorpe in 1876. Another film camera was designed in England by Frenchman Louis Le Prince in 1888. An earlier 16 lens camera in 1887 at his workshop in Leeds. The first 8 lenses would be triggered in rapid succession by an electromagnetic shutter on the sensitive film; the film would then be moved forward allowing the other 8 lenses to operate on the film. After much trial and error, he was finally able to develop a single lens camera in 1888, which he used to shoot the first sequences of moving film in the world, including the Roundhay Garden Scene and Leeds Bridge. According to Adolphe Le Prince, who assisted his father at Leeds, Roundhay Garden was shot at 12 frame/s and Leeds Bridge at 20 frame/s. His camera still exists with the National Media Museum in Bradford. He shot the film on celluloid with 1¾ inch width.|$|R
