5|$|On 6August1860 the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway (A), {{with the}} 3rd Duke (then still Marquess of Chandos) as {{chairman}} and Sir Harry Verney as deputy chairman, was incorporated by Act of Parliament with the object of connecting the Buckinghamshire Railway (by now operated by the LNWR) to Aylesbury. The 2nd Duke used his influence to ensure the new route would run via Quainton, near his remaining estates around Wotton, instead of the intended more direct route via Pitchcott. Beset by financial difficulties, the line took over eight years to build, eventually opening on 23September1868. The new line {{was connected to the}} Wycombe Railway's Aylesbury station, and joined the existing Buckinghamshire Railway lines <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Oxford–Bletchley line and the line to Buckingham already met. Verney Junction railway station was built <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> lines joined, named after Sir Harry who owned the land on which it was built, since there was no nearby town. Aylesbury now had railways to the east, north and southwest, but no line southeast towards London and the Channel ports.|$|E
5|$|Camus was the {{supposed}} {{leader of a}} Norse expeditionary force defeated by the armies of King Malcolm II at the Battle of Barry. Tradition, popularised {{in the sixteenth century}} by historian Hector Boece, states that Camus fled the battle scene when defeat was imminent, and was caught and slain <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> cross now stands. The battle, and its main protagonists, including Camus, are now known to be historically inauthentic.|$|E
5|$|The Old Man is {{probably}} less than 250 years old, and may soon collapse. The stack is {{not mentioned in}} the Orkneyinga saga, written 1230, and on the Blaeu map of 1600, a headland exists <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Old Man is now. The McKenzie map of Hoy of 1750 similarly shows a headland but no stack, but by 1819 the Old Man had been separated from the mainland. William Daniell sketched the sea stack at this time as a wider column with a smaller top section and an arch at the base, from which it derived its name.|$|E

5|$|The canal {{started at}} a lock {{constructed}} {{on the old}} course of the River Brue, which had been bypassed by a new cut in 1801 and filled in. It then followed {{the course of the}} Brue to Cripps Bridge, after which it followed the Cripps River to Gold Corner. The first part of the Cripps River was originally part of a loop on the River Brue, which was bypassed by a new cut made under the 1801 act. Gold Corner is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> Huntspill River, the Cripps River and the South Drain meet.|$|E
5|$|The {{county town}} of Norfolk, Norwich {{is a city}} on the River Wensum in the East of England. Its origins are unclear, but by the reign of King Æthelstan (924–939) the city was a major trading centre {{and one of the}} most {{important}} boroughs in England. The Anglo-Saxon settlement was centred around Tombland, a large open space <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> roads into Norwich converged. The plain of Tombland was the site of Norwich's market.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Sheriff Hill, Carr Hill and Low Fell, Deckham's {{history is}} sparsely recorded. It {{indicates}} that, {{by the middle}} of the 19th century, there was a small settlement which was part of Gateshead Fell; a wild and treacherous area of common land notable for the criminality of the tinkers and hawkers who lived there. Ordnance survey mapping illustrates the sparsity of buildings in 1860; the area contained little except Deckham Hall, a few other dwellings and two public houses <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> old turnpike road branched off towards Carr's Hill. The two public houses were the 'Speed the Plough' and 'The Ship'.|$|E

5|$|A pair of towers {{stand on}} the river's edge a short {{distance}} on either side from the main building. They were originally two-storyed open-backed structures with gun platforms situated on their first floors, providing flanking fire down {{the line of the}} ditch around the castle's perimeter. They were later adapted for use as accommodation, with their backs closed with bricks and the towers increased in height to provide a third storey. Traces of the gun embrasures can still be seen <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> original roofline was. The South Tower was said to have been {{for the use of the}} castle's governor, though their lack of comfort meant that successive governors declined to live there. The two towers are linked to the main building by a crenallated curtain wall where additional cannon were emplaced in two embrasures on the north parapet and one on the south.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{north into}} the town of Sparta, NY63 runs along {{the east side of}} a wide, rural valley {{surrounding}} Canaseraga Creek, with NY36 and I-390 following the west side. The route eventually reaches the town of Groveland and hamlet of Groveland Station, where NY258, a connector to NY36, comes in from the west at the town line. Another long, open stretch brings the route to the vicinity of the village of Mount Morris, where it runs much closer to I-390 and indirectly connects to the expressway by way of NY408 at Hampton Corners. From this point north, the road becomes busier as NY63 is the primary route to the village of Geneseo for northbound traffic on I-390 itself, as there is no exit <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> expressway crosses under NY63. I-390 ultimately bypasses Geneseo to the southeast while NY63 heads north toward the village, briefly joining with U.S. Route20A (US20A) and NY39 just outside the village limits.|$|E
5|$|Pomona Docks {{have also}} been filled in except for the still intact No. 3 Dock, and are largely derelict. A lock at No. 3 Dock connects it to the nearby Bridgewater Canal <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> two canals run in parallel. The western four docks have been {{converted}} into the Salford Quays development; ships using the Manchester Ship Canal now dock at various places along the canal side such as Mode Wheel (Salford), Trafford Park, and Ellesmere Port. Most ships have to terminate at Salford Quays, although vessels capable of passing under Trafford Road swing bridge (permanently closed in 1992) can continue up the River Irwell to Hunts Bank, near Manchester Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|The {{mouthpiece}} {{and reed}} {{are surrounded by}} the player's lips, which put light, even pressure on the reed and form an airtight seal. Air is blown past the reed and down the instrument. In {{the same way a}} flag flaps in the breeze, the air rushing past the reed causes it to vibrate. As air pressure from the mouth increases, the amount the reed vibrates increases until the reed hits the mouthpiece. At this point the reed stays pressed against the mouthpiece until either the springiness of the reed forces it to open or a returning pressure wave 'bumps' into the reed and opens it. Each time the reed opens, a puff of air goes through the gap, after which the reed swings shut again. When played loudly, the reed can spend up to 50% of the time shut. The 'puff of air' or compression wave (around 3% greater pressure than the surrounding air) travels down the cylindrical tube and escapes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> tube opens out. This is either at the closest open hole or {{at the end of the}} tube (see diagram: image 1).|$|E
5|$|The outer {{gate of the}} {{fortress}} lies in the northwestern side of the outer ward, originally within a small recess in the outer curtain wall, protected by a portcullis. The recess was later filled by the Turks with a smaller set of walls, so as to preserve unbroken the outer wall's frontage. The Ottomans also added additional buttresses to the junctions of their wall with the original curtain wall, while {{the space between the}} original gate and the new, Ottoman entrance was left unroofed and open to the sky. From the gate, the outer wall continues east and then south, in three distinct stretches of walls, to the keep. The wall is built of limestone masonry, with little evidence of brick or tiles, topped by a small inner parapet and Ottoman-built crenellations, now largely ruined. From the beginning, buildings were built leaning on the outer wall, as evidenced by the remnant of their foundations, side walls joining the curtain wall's inner face, or the presence of fireplaces and lancet windows in the curtain wall. One of these buildings is largely preserved immediately next to the outer gate. Windows, fireplaces etc. display a uniformity of style that points to their construction {{at the same time as}} {{the fortress}} itself. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> outer wall joins the keep, a small postern is located, as well as a stairway leading up to the outer wall's chemin de ronde.|$|E
