5|$|According to some scholars, the Black Stone was {{the same}} stone that Islamic {{tradition}} describes as greeting Muhammad before his prophethood. This led to a debate <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Black Stone's greeting comprised actual speech or merely a sound, and following that, whether the stone was a living creature or an inanimate object. Whichever was the case, the stone was held to be a symbol of prophethood.|$|E
5|$|A.M. is {{the debut}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band Wilco, released on March 28, 1995, by Sire Records and Reprise Records. The album was released only {{months after the}} breakup of Uncle Tupelo, an alternative country band that was the predecessor of Wilco. Prior to its release, there was debate <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> album {{would be better than}} the debut album of Son Volt, the new band of former Uncle Tupelo lead singer Jay Farrar.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with ten}} other former senior officers, Manstein was called on in 1955 by the Amt Blank to {{formulate}} {{plans for the}} re-founding of the German army. On 20 June 1953, {{he spoke to the}} Bundestag, giving his analysis of strategic power considerations and the country's defence and spoke <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> country should have a professional army or a conscripted army. His opinion was that the length of service for Bundeswehr conscripts should be at least 18 months, preferably 24 months. His idea to form a reserve force was later implemented.|$|E
50|$|As {{early as}} 2002, when the Metropolitan Police's anti-corruption unit {{was engaged in}} Operation Nigeria, The Guardian raised {{questions}} <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> all <b>the</b> evidence relating to police corruption was being pursued.|$|R

5|$|As Haiti's {{economic}} situation had deteriorated {{during the second}} Aristide presidency, demonstrations proliferated everywhere throughout the nation and political dialogue broke down between opposition leaders and the Aristide government. Carney, who spoke at the inaugural event and later {{went on to become}} Chairman of the Board for the project, raised concerns <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> United States government was paying attention to the gravity of problems that were beginning to affect Haiti's stability systemically.|$|E
5|$|Asser is {{sometimes}} {{cited as a}} source for the legend about Alfred's having founded the University of Oxford, which is now known to be false. A short passage making this claim was interpolated by William Camden into his 1603 edition of Asser's Life. Doubts have also been raised periodically <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> entire Life is a forgery, written by a slightly later writer, but it is now almost universally accepted as genuine.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the show was good to average, with a general appreciation for the realistic portrayal of Middle America. Generally speaking, however, there were serious doubts <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> show {{would be able to}} stay on the air very long, though it has since gone on to complete five seasons. The episode's viewership of just over seven million was characterized as disappointing, though it did relatively well among men aged 18 to 34.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being an}} {{artillery}} tower {{with a flat}} roof to carry heavy guns, the tower was not initially supplied with any artillery and was therefore unable to protect Rye against the hostile naval expeditions which attacked the coast in the 1520s. After many letters to from Guldeford to the Lord Chancellor, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, some guns finally arrived around 1536 {{in the form of}} wrought iron serpentines. Prescient concerns began to be raised in the mid-1530s <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Camber might silt up further and ultimately become unusable as an anchorage.|$|E
5|$|However, {{although}} no structural brain damage occurs {{according to the}} classic definition, some researchers have included injuries in which structural damage has occurred and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence definition includes physiological or physical disruption in the brain's synapses. Also, by definition, concussion has historically involved a loss of consciousness. However, the definition has evolved over time to include a change in consciousness, such as amnesia, although controversy continues <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> definition should include only those injuries in which loss of consciousness occurs.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 Pistorius {{applied to}} run in non-disabled track meets. He was at first accepted, but {{questions}} quickly arose <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> blades give him an unfair advantage. After initial research showed the blades did provide an advantage, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) changed their rules to ban the use of technical devices that provide an advantage and ruled him ineligible to compete. Pistorius challenged the ruling with additional research and was reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2008, meaning that he can continue {{to run in}} non-disabled meets {{as long as he}} uses the equipment that was studied in the research.|$|E

5|$|The {{executive}} {{summary of the}} TRC concluded that the assimilation amounted to cultural genocide. The ambiguity of the phrasing allowed for the interpretation that physical and biological genocide also occurred. The TRC was not authorized to conclude that physical and biological genocide occurred, as such a finding would imply a legal responsibility of the Canadian government that {{would be difficult to}} prove. As a result, the debate <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Canadian government also committed physical and biological genocide against Indigenous populations remains open.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} a rematch {{of an early}} regular-season contest, but even though Georgia Tech won that game, there were {{questions}} <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> victory would be repeated. Twice before, the two teams matched in the ACC Championship Game had played earlier that season. Both times, the loser of the first matchup won the second. There also were questions about each team's quality because of their losses in rivalry games against Southeastern Conference foes.|$|E
5|$|The {{screening}} of Underbelly in Victoria {{was put into}} jeopardy after last-minute legal proceedings were instituted by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Jeremy Rapke, QC. Rapke secured an urgent viewing of the series, after which he decided to seek an injunction stopping its broadcast in Victoria. A Supreme Court judge called prosecutors and defence lawyers together after serious concerns were raised <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> show could prejudice {{the jury in the}} trial of Evangelos Goussis, who had pleaded not guilty to the 2004 gangland killing of Lewis Moran. Although Goussis was not named in the series, there were concerns the show could hurt his chance of a fair trial.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} argument among paleontologists <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> main wing membranes (brachiopatagia) {{attached to the}} hind limbs, and if so, where. Fossils of the rhamphorhynchoid Sordes, the anurognathid Jeholopterus, and a pterodactyloid from the Santana Formation seem {{to demonstrate that the}} wing membrane did attach to the hindlimbs, at least in some species. However, modern bats and flying squirrels show considerable variation in the extent of their wing membranes and it is possible that, like these groups, different species of pterosaur had different wing designs. Indeed, analysis of pterosaur limb proportions shows that there was considerable variation, possibly reflecting a variety of wing-plans.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} debates <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} gene duplication events {{occurred in a}} salivary gland or in body tissues themselves. The prevailing idea for many years is the birth-and-death model described above, in which genes in other body tissues are duplicated and then recruited to the venom gland before natural selection for toxicity. However, in 2014 a new model {{was proposed in which}} salivary protein genes are duplicated and then restricted to the venom gland. This model does away with the recruitment hypothesis and cites the homology between certain venom and body genes as unrelated in the linear fashion described in the traditional birth-and-death model.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} debate <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate is correct, {{and of the}} relevance of the Jevons paradox to energy conservation policy. Most governments, environmentalists and NGOs pursue policies that improve efficiency, holding that it will lower resource consumption and reduce environmental problems. Others, including many environmental economists, doubt this 'efficiency strategy' towards sustainability, and worry that efficiency gains may in fact lead to higher production and consumption. They hold that for resource use to fall, efficiency gains should be coupled with other policies that limit resource use.|$|E

5|$|When Cleveland {{entered the}} NFL in 1950, {{questions}} lingered <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> team could sustain its early dominance. The Browns, however, began the season by beating the defending NFL champions, the Philadelphia Eagles. The team {{finished with a}} 10–2 regular-season record and reached the championship game after winning a playoff game against the New York Giants. In the championship against the Los Angeles Rams, Lavelli caught 11 passes – then a record for a title game – and had two touchdown receptions. The Browns won the game 30–28.|$|E
5|$|Without the cost-sharing subsidies, the {{government}} estimated that premiums would increase by 20 percent to 30 percent for silver plans. In 2017, the uncertainty <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> payments would continue caused Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina {{to try to}} raise premiums by 22.9 percent the next year, {{as opposed to an}} increase of only 8.8 percent that it would have sought if the payments were assured.|$|E
5|$|A strain is a {{subgroup}} {{within the}} species that has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other strains. These differences are often detectable only at the molecular level; however, they may result in changes to the physiology or lifecycle of the bacterium. For example, a strain may gain pathogenic capacity, {{the ability to use}} a unique carbon source, the ability to take upon a particular ecological niche, or the ability to resist antimicrobial agents. Different strains of E. coli are often host-specific, making it possible to determine the source of fecal contamination in environmental samples. For example, knowing which E. coli strains are present in a water sample allows researchers to make assumptions <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> contamination originated from a human, another mammal, or a bird.|$|E
