If {{the height of a}} rooftop mounted turbine tower is approximately 50% of the building height it is near the optimum for maximum wind energy and minimum wind turbulence.

25|$|As {{with other}} myopathies, the {{clinical}} manifestations of MTM/CNM are most notably muscle weakness and associated disabilities. Congenital forms often present with neonatal low muscle tone, severe weakness, delayed developmental milestones (particularly gross motor milestones such as head control, crawling, and walking) and pulmonary complications (presumably due to {{weakness of the}} muscles responsible for respiration). While some patients with centronuclear myopathies remain ambulatory throughout their adult life, others may never crawl or walk and may require wheelchair use for mobility. There is substantial variability {{in the degree of}} functional impairment among the various centronuclear myopathies.

30|$|We have {{evaluated}} {{the role of}} twist {{in the formation of}} stress-strain state in O-rings. Such a twist can be related to the installation process when the ring may be placed in a high stress equilibrium state by twisting (and stretching). This causes elastic instabilities resulting in highly deformed O-ring shapes. Numerical results show that pure O-ring twist causes localized hoop stresses up to 0.4 G. Numerical analysis using compressible models allowed prediction of the stable deformed states that do not remain round. The O-ring is buckled and reaches a chair-type non-planar shape just beyond inside-out twist. This is an illustration of the fundamental elastic instability. The results indicate that elastic material volume change causes <b>additional</b> <b>stresses</b> mostly associated with an additional hydrostatic pressure. Hence, it is important to use compressible models for accurate stress state predictions. If the ring is set on a rigid cylinder, its shape is defined and <b>additional</b> <b>stresses,</b> sometimes very localized, arise that in turn may lead to the O-ring cracking.|$|R

He said, [...] "The real reason why I didn't come home was I was just too raw. You know, I would look in the mirror, and I couldn't recognize myself." [...] He also believed that a return to basketball would help him slowly reduce the trauma from Libya.

Jay's brother-in-law Henry Brock Livingston was lost at sea through the disappearance of the Continental Navy ship Saratoga during the Revolutionary War. While in Paris, as a diplomat to France, Jay's father died. This event forced extra responsibility onto Jay.

2500|$|Resilver (repair) of a crashed disk in a ZFS RAID {{can take}} a long time (this is not unique to ZFS, it applies to all types of RAID, in one way or another). This means that very large volumes can take several days to repair or to being back to full {{redundancy}} after severe data corruption or failure, and during this time a second disk failure may occur, especially as the repair puts <b>additional</b> <b>stress</b> on the system as a whole. In turn this means that configurations that only allow for recovery of a single disk failure, such as RAIDZ1 (similar to RAID5) should be avoided. Therefore, with large disks, one should use RAIDZ2 (allow two disks to crash) or RAIDZ3 (allow three disks to crash). [...] It should be noted however, that ZFS RAID differs from conventional RAID by only reconstructing live data and metadata when replacing a disk, not the entirety of the disk including blank and garbage blocks, which means that replacing a member disk on a ZFS pool that is only partially full will take considerably less time compared to conventional RAID.|$|E
