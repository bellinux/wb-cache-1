5|$|Pteranodon fossils {{are known}} {{primarily}} from the Niobrara Formation of the central United States. Broadly defined, Pteranodon existed {{for more than four}} million years, during the late Coniacian to early Campanian stages of the Cretaceous period. The genus is present in most layers of the Niobrara Formation except for the upper two; in 2003, Kenneth Carpenter surveyed the distribution and dating of fossils in this formation, demonstrating that Pteranodon sternbergi existed there from 88 to 85 million years ago, while P. longiceps existed between 86 and 84.5 million years ago. A possible third species, which Kellner named Geosternbergia maysei in 2010, is known from the Sharon Springs member of the Pierre Shale Formation in Kansas, Wyoming, <b>and</b> <b>South</b> <b>Dakota,</b> dating to between 81.5 and 80.5 million years ago.|$|E

5|$|Although Clement {{spent only}} six years {{serving as an}} umpire on a regular basis, she {{continued}} to serve intermittently until her forties. Following her time as a regularly serving umpire, Amanda Clement spent several years teaching physical education at the University of Wyoming, the Jamestown, North Dakota high school, and other schools in North Dakota <b>and</b> <b>South</b> <b>Dakota.</b> Clement also managed several Y.W.C.A.s, including one in LaCrosse, Wisconsin. Clement also served as the coach of Hudson Independent basketball team, organized tennis tournaments, {{and served as a}} newspaper reporter, police matron, typesetter, justice of the peace, and as the city assessor for the town of Hudson. In 1929 Clement moved back to South Dakota to care for her mother, who was ill. Following her mother's death in 1934, Clement moved to Sioux Falls, South Dakota where she spent twenty-five years as a social worker before retiring in 1966. Clement died in Sioux Falls on July 20, 1971.|$|E
5|$|Protestantism is {{the largest}} Christian {{religious}} grouping in the United States. Baptists collectively form the largest branch of Protestantism, and the Southern Baptist Convention {{is the largest}} individual Protestant denomination. Roman Catholicism in the United States has its origin primarily in the Spanish and French colonization of the Americas and, in part, in the English Catholic Proprietary of Maryland, It later grew because of Irish, Italian, Polish, German and Hispanic immigration. Rhode Island has {{the highest percentage of}} Catholics with 40 percent of the total population. Lutheranism in the U.S. has its origin in immigration from Northern Europe and Germany. North <b>and</b> <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> are the only states in which a plurality of the population is Lutheran. Presbyterianism was introduced in North America by Scottish and Ulster Scots immigrants. Although it has spread across the United States, it is heavily concentrated on the East Coast. Dutch Reformed congregations were founded first in New Amsterdam (New York City) before spreading westward. Utah is the only state where Mormonism is the religion {{of the majority of the}} population. The Mormon Corridor also extends to parts of Idaho, Nevada and Wyoming.|$|E
5|$|Specimens {{assigned}} to Pteranodon {{have been found}} in both the Smoky Hill Chalk deposits of the Niobrara Formation, and the slightly younger Sharon Springs deposits of the Pierre Shale Formation. When Pteranodon was alive, this area was covered by a large inland sea, known as the Western Interior Seaway. Famous for fossils collected since 1870, these formations extend from as far south as Kansas in the United States to Manitoba in Canada. However, Pteranodon specimens (or any pterosaur specimens) have only been found in the southern half of the formation, in Kansas, Wyoming, <b>and</b> <b>South</b> <b>Dakota.</b> Despite the fact that numerous fossils {{have been found in}} the contemporary parts of the formation in Canada, no pterosaur specimens have ever been found there. This strongly suggests that the natural geographic range of Pteranodon covered only {{the southern part of the}} Niobrara, and that its habitat did not extend farther north than South Dakota.|$|E

5|$|The first named {{specimen}} now {{attributed to}} Triceratops {{is a pair}} of brow horns attached to a skull roof, found near Denver, Colorado in the spring of 1887. This specimen was sent to Othniel Charles Marsh, who believed that the formation from which it came dated from the Pliocene, and that the bones belonged to a particularly large and unusual bison, which he named Bison alticornis. He realized that there were horned dinosaurs by the next year, which saw his publication of the genus Ceratops from fragmentary remains, but he still believed B. alticornis to be a Pliocene mammal. It took a third and much more complete skull to change his mind. The specimen, collected in 1888 by John Bell Hatcher from the Lance Formation of Wyoming, was initially described as another species of Ceratops. After reflection, Marsh changed his mind and gave it the generic name Triceratops, accepting his Bison alticornis as another species of Ceratops (it would later be added to Triceratops). The sturdy nature of the animal's skull has ensured that many examples have been preserved as fossils, allowing variations between species and individuals to be studied. Triceratops remains have subsequently been found in the American states of Montana <b>and</b> <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> (in addition to Colorado and Wyoming), and in the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta, Canada.|$|E
