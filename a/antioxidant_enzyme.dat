5|$|As {{with the}} {{chemical}} antioxidants, cells are protected against oxidative stress by an interacting network of antioxidant enzymes. Here, the superoxide released by {{processes such as}} oxidative phosphorylation is first converted to hydrogen peroxide and then further reduced to give water. This detoxification pathway {{is the result of}} multiple enzymes, with superoxide dismutases catalysing the first step and then catalases and various peroxidases removing hydrogen peroxide. As with antioxidant metabolites, the contributions of these enzymes to antioxidant defenses can be hard to separate from one another, but the generation of transgenic mice lacking just one <b>antioxidant</b> <b>enzyme</b> can be informative.|$|E

40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) and {{reactive}} nitrogen species (RNS) are generated from aerobic metabolism, {{as a result}} of accidental electron leakage as well as regulated enzymatic processes. Because ROS/RNS can induce oxidative injury and act in redox signaling, enzymes metabolizing them will inherently promote either health or disease, depending on the physiological context. It is thus misleading to consider conventionally called <b>antioxidant</b> <b>enzymes</b> to be largely, if not exclusively, health protective. Because such a notion is nonetheless common, we herein attempt to rationalize why this simplistic view should be avoided. First we give an updated summary of physiological phenotypes triggered in mouse models of overexpression or knockout of major <b>antioxidant</b> <b>enzymes.</b> Subsequently, we focus on a series of striking cases that demonstrate “paradoxical” outcomes, i. e., increased fitness upon deletion of <b>antioxidant</b> <b>enzymes</b> or disease triggered by their overexpression. We elaborate mechanisms by which these phenotypes are mediated via chemical, biological, and metabolic interactions of the <b>antioxidant</b> <b>enzymes</b> with their substrates, downstream events, and cellular context. Furthermore, we propose that novel treatments of antioxidant enzyme-related human diseases may be enabled by deliberate targeting of dual roles of the pertaining enzymes. We also discuss the potential of “antioxidant” nutrients and phytochemicals, via regulating the expression or function of <b>antioxidant</b> <b>enzymes,</b> in preventing, treating, or aggravating chronic diseases. We conclude that “paradoxical” roles of <b>antioxidant</b> <b>enzymes</b> in physiology, health, and disease derive from sophisticated molecular mechanisms of redox biology and metabolic homeostasis. Simply viewing <b>antioxidant</b> <b>enzymes</b> as always being beneficial is not only conceptually misleading but also clinically hazardous if such notions underpin medical treatment protocols based on modulation of redox pathways...|$|R
40|$|Background : Contact lens induced {{trauma to}} the corneal {{epithelium}} results in increased release of inflammatory mediators. The keratocyte apoptosis {{is directly related to}} epithelial injury and has been correlated with increased production of nitric oxide. Potent <b>antioxidant</b> <b>enzymes</b> protect cells from oxidative damage by inactivating reactive oxygen species and thus inhibiting apoptosis. This study aims at determination of total nitric oxide and <b>antioxidant</b> <b>enzymes</b> in tears which will be an indirect criteria for assessing apoptosis. Materials and Methods : Nitric oxide and <b>antioxidant</b> <b>enzymes</b> were estimated in tears of 25 soft contact lens wearers and compared with 25 age and sex matched controls. Results : Statistically significant increase of nitric oxide (P&# 60; 0. 001), superoxide dismutase (P&# 60; 0. 001) and glutathione peroxidase (P&# 60; 0. 001) levels was seen in tears of contact lens wearers as compared to controls. There was also statistically significant increase in the levels of <b>antioxidant</b> <b>enzymes,</b> superoxide dismutase (P&# 60; 0. 05) and glutathione peroxidase (P&# 60; 0. 01), with increase in the total duration of contact lens wear in years. Conclusions : Increase in the level of nitric oxide and <b>antioxidant</b> <b>enzymes</b> in tears of contact lens wearers suggested that contact lens wear suppresses the process of apoptosis. However, it was also postulated that the increased levels of nitric oxide balances the anti-apoptotic activities of increased levels of <b>antioxidant</b> <b>enzymes</b> by its pro-apoptotic activity leading to protective outcomes in contact lens wearers...|$|R

2500|$|According to Blough & Zepp, {{superoxide}} {{is one of}} {{the hardest}} reactive oxygen species to quantify because it is present in low concentrations: 2×10−12 M in the open ocean and up to 2×10−10M in coastal areas. [...] The main sources of biological superoxide in the ocean come from the reduction of oxygen at the cell surface and metabolites released into the water. In marine systems, superoxide most often acts as a one-electron reductant, but it can also serve as an oxidant and may increase the normally slow oxidation rates of environmental compounds. [...] Superoxide is very unstable, with between 50 and 80% of its concentration of anions spontaneously disproportionating to hydrogen peroxide. [...] At its peak, this reaction occurs with a rate constant on the order of 2.2×104 – 4.5×105 L mol−1sec−1 in seawater. [...] The dismutation of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide can also be catalyzed by the <b>antioxidant</b> <b>enzyme</b> superoxide dismutase with a rate constant on the order of 2×109 L mol−1sec−1. As a result of these fast acting processes, the steady state concentration of superoxide is very small. Since superoxide is also moderately reactive towards trace metals and dissolved organic matter, any remaining superoxide is thought to be removed from the water column through reactions with these species. As a result, the presence of superoxide in surface waters has been known to result in an increase of reduced iron. This, in turn, serves to enhance the availability of iron to phytoplankton whose growth is often limited by this key nutrient. [...] As a charged radical species, superoxide is unlikely to significantly affect an organism's cellular function since it is not able to easily diffuse through the cell membrane. [...] Instead, its potential toxicity lies in its ability to react with extracellular surface proteins or carbohydrates to inactivate their functions. [...] Although its lifetime is fairly short (about 50 microseconds), superoxide has the potential to reach cell surfaces since it has a diffusion distance of about 320nm.|$|E

The mRNA levels of inflammatory mediators including TNFα, iNOS, COX- 2 and <b>antioxidant</b> <b>enzymes</b> including glutathione peroxidase, catalase, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase in the hippocampus were studied by RT-PCR. Apoptosis was studied histologically in hippocampal sections. Our results showed significant increases in the cell death, levels of serum and hippocampal MDA and mRNA levels of inflammatory mediators in vehicle groups compared with the normoxic control, but mRNA levels of the <b>antioxidant</b> <b>enzymes</b> were decreased in those groups.

40|$|Abstract Background Plasmodium falciparum -parasitized {{red blood}} cells (RBCs) are {{equipped}} with protective <b>antioxidant</b> <b>enzymes</b> and heat shock proteins (HSPs). The latter are only considered to protect against thermal stress. Important issues are poorly explored: first, it is insufficiently known how both systems are expressed {{in relation to the}} parasite developmental stage; secondly, it is unknown whether P. falciparum HSPs are redox-responsive, in view of redox sensitivity of HSP in eukaryotic cells; thirdly, it is poorly known how the antioxidant defense machinery would respond to increased oxidative stress or inhibited antioxidant defense. Those issues are interesting as several antimalarials increase the oxidative stress or block antioxidant defense in the parasitized RBC. In addition, numerous inhibitors of HSPs are currently developed for cancer therapy and might be tested as anti-malarials. Thus, the joint disruption of the parasite antioxidant enzymes/HSP system would interfere with parasite growth and open new perspectives for anti-malaria therapy. Methods Stage-dependent mRNA expression of ten representative P. falciparum <b>antioxidant</b> <b>enzymes</b> and hsp 60 / 70 – 2 / 70 – 3 / 75 / 90 was studied by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in parasites growing in normal RBCs, in RBCs oxidatively-stressed by moderate H 2 O 2 generation and in G 6 PD-deficient RBCs. Protein expression of <b>antioxidant</b> <b>enzymes</b> was assayed by Western blotting. The pentosephosphate-pathway flux was measured in isolated parasites after Sendai-virus lysis of RBC membrane. Results In parasites growing in normal RBCs, mRNA expression of <b>antioxidant</b> <b>enzymes</b> and HSPs displayed co-ordinated stage-dependent modulation, being low at ring, highest at early trophozoite and again very low at schizont stage. Additional exogenous oxidative stress or growth in antioxidant blunted G 6 PD-deficient RBCs indicated remarkable flexibility of both systems, manifested by enhanced, co-ordinated mRNA expression of <b>antioxidant</b> <b>enzymes</b> and HSPs. Protein expression of <b>antioxidant</b> <b>enzymes</b> was also increased in oxidatively-stressed trophozoites.

Secondly, both systems were redox-responsive and showed remarkably increased and co-ordinated expression in oxidatively-stressed parasites and in parasites growing in antioxidant blunted G 6 PD-deficient RBCs.
