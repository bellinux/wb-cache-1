40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the effects of problem-solving instructional strategy, three <b>accompanying</b> <b>modes</b> of instruction (i. e. Remediation, Feedback and Practice) and gender on learning outcomes in chemistry. A pre-test post-test control group quasi experimental design was adopted for the study. Data were collected from a sample of 210 SS 2 Chemistry Students made up of 109 males and 101 females selected from six schools in three (3) Local Government Areas of Ekiti State, Nigeria based on multi-stage random sampling techniques. The Seven Step Chemistry Problem-Solving Model as suggested by Frazer (1981) and Selvarantnam (1983) was adopted for the study. The experiment was carried out on four (4) groups of Students. The Students in experimental groups 1 and 2 were exposed to Problem-Solving approach coupled with remediation and feedback respectively, experimental group 3 was exposed to Problem-Solving coupled with practice. The fourth group not treated formed the control group. Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was used to analyse the data with the pre-test scores as covariates. The findings revealed that students in experimental group 1 (i. e. Problem-Solving coupled with remediation) had the highest performance in Chemistry Achievement Test (CAT) followed by those exposed in experimental group 2 and 3 respectively (i. e. Problem-Solving coupled with feedback and practice respectively). However, the control group had the least performance in Chemistry Achievement Test (CAT). The implications were discussed and recommendations given...|$|R
