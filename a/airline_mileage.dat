50|$|Though United tracked {{customers}} {{as far back}} as the 1950s, the very first modern frequent-flyer program was created in 1972 by Western Direct Marketing, for United Airlines. It gave plaques and promotional materials to members. In 1979, Texas International Airlines created the first frequent-flyer program that used mileage tracking to give 'rewards' to its passengers, while in 1980 Western Airlines created its Travel Bank, which ultimately became part of Delta Air Lines' program upon their merger in 1987. American Airlines' AAdvantage program launched in 1981 as a modification of a never-realized concept from 1979 that would have given special fares to frequent customers. It was quickly followed later that year by programs from United <b>Airlines</b> (<b>Mileage</b> Plus) and Delta Air Lines (SkyMiles), and in 1982 from British Airways (Executive Club).|$|R

The program was subsequently renamed to MileagePlus, and maintains its relationship with its Star Alliance partners, {{as well as other}} airline and travel enterprise agreements.|$|R
5000|$|SkyMiles is the frequent-flyer {{program of}} Delta Air Lines that offers points (or [...] "miles") to {{passengers}} traveling on most fare types, {{as well as}} to consumers who utilize Delta co-branded credit cards, which accumulate towards free awards such as airline tickets, business and first class upgrades, and luxury products. Created in 1981 as the [...] "Delta Air Lines Frequent Flyer Program"; its name was changed to SkyMiles in 1995. Delta claims that it is the only major U.S. <b>airline</b> without <b>mileage</b> expiration, so travelers can redeem awards at their leisure. [...] The airline also has a separate SkyBonus program that provides small to mid-sized business owners with a way to earn points for trips taken by employees, good towards free flights, upgrades, Silver Medallion status and other travel awards.|$|R

50|$|Although EuroBonus {{has been}} awarded Freddie Awards several times, some SAS Group {{passengers}} voiced the concern that not all booking classes may earned full EuroBonus points; this practice has been changed and all Economy Class tickets (SAS Go) are earned full points, while the Premium Economy (SAS Plus) earned between 200% and 300% of original points. EuroBonus were also criticized that the point earned will expire within 4 years after the qualification period, regardless of activities, which {{is in contrast to}} other <b>airlines</b> that the <b>mileage</b> will not expire, subject to certain conditions such as activities.|$|R
2500|$|Northwest Airlines' frequent-flyer program, WorldPerks, offered regular {{travelers}} {{the ability}} to obtain free tickets, First Class upgrades on flights, discounted membership for its airport lounges (WorldClubs), or other types of rewards. Customers could accumulate miles from actual flight segments flown or through Northwest's partners, such as car rental companies, hotels, credit cards, and other vendors. WorldPerks' elite tiers were Silver Elite, Gold Elite and Platinum elite which allowed for more mileage bonuses, priority wait lists and standby and other benefits. Over the years, some details of the program changed, such as introducing capacity controlled awards (only {{a certain number of}} seats allocated for free travel), expiration of account if no activity occurred in three years, requirement of a Saturday-night stay for domestic coach awards, waiving of capacity controls for awards but requiring double the amount of miles for redemption, and adding several partner <b>airlines</b> for <b>mileage</b> accumulation and award redemption. The original name of the WorldPerks program was the Northwest Orient Airlines Free Flight Plan, which began in 1981. The original program used paper coupons and gave credit for flight segments. Upon renaming the program to [...] "WorldPerks", a mileage-based system was used.|$|R
