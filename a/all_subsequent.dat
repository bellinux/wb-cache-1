5|$|A {{number of}} minor {{problems}} surfaced, but were readily fixed. The yaw damper of the XF-104 {{was found to}} be ineffective and the rudder did not positively center, these problems were corrected by revising the rudder control system. The unpowered rudder did not provide adequate directional control at high air speeds (remedied by using hydraulic power on <b>all</b> <b>subsequent</b> versions of the F-104) and some concern was expressed over poor subsonic maneuverability at higher altitudes.|$|E

5|$|Following the tour, Wright {{left the}} group {{to work on the}} {{upcoming}} Dio album Lock Up the Wolves, and was replaced by session veteran Chris Slade. Johnson was unavailable for several months while finalising his divorce, so the Young brothers wrote all the songs for the next album, a practice they continued for <b>all</b> <b>subsequent</b> releases through Rock or Bust in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Other {{analysis}} {{suggested that}} in fleet actions, only broadsides were effective, thus maximizing {{the number of}} centerline guns was the most efficient approach.

The original 1940 machine was donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 1960.|$|E
5|$|The reliefs of Nyuserre's Sed festival offer a rare {{glimpse into}} the ritual acts carried out during this ceremony.

During that time, sophisticated methods of perturbation analysis were invented to calculate the deviations of orbits due to the influence of multiple bodies on a planet, moon, comet, or asteroid. The formalism was exact enough to allow mathematicians to predict the existence of the planet Neptune before it was observed.|$|E
5|$|Wipeout 64 is a 1998 futuristic racing game {{developed}} by Psygnosis {{and published by}} Midway Games exclusively for the Nintendo 64. It is the third game in the Wipeout series and remains the only one published on a Nintendo console.

5|$|A {{report by}} an amateur radio {{operator}} {{who claimed to}} have received a faint SOS signal from Star Dust initially raised hopes that there might have been survivors, but <b>all</b> <b>subsequent</b> attempts over the years to find the vanished flight failed. In the absence of any hard evidence, numerous theories arose —including rumours of sabotage (compounded by the later disappearance of two other aircraft also belonging to British South American Airways); speculation that the flight might have been blown up to destroy diplomatic documents being carried by passenger Paul Simpson; or even the suggestion that Star Dust might have been taken or destroyed by a UFO (an idea fuelled by unresolved questions about the flight's final Morse code message).|$|E

5|$|A snail {{does not}} have a dart to fire the very first time it mates, because the first mating is {{necessary}} to trigger the process of dart formation. Once a snail has mated, it fires a dart before some, but not <b>all,</b> <b>subsequent</b> matings. A snail often mates without having a dart to use, because it takes time to create a replacement dart. In the case of the garden snail Cornu aspersum, it takes a week for a new dart to form.|$|E
5|$|After a month-long break, Nine Inch Nails again hit {{the road}} on a joint tour with Soundgarden. The 23-day journey {{extended}} throughout the continental US, with experimental hip-hop group Death Grips scheduled to open most of the shows. Two weeks into the tour, Death Grips announced their break up and cancelled <b>all</b> <b>subsequent</b> live shows. Oneohtrix Point Never, The Dillinger Escape Plan and Cold Cave each replaced Death Grips separately {{for the remainder of}} the tour.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} {{differences}} in season one, the current rules have applied in <b>all</b> <b>subsequent</b> seasons.

This fight usually gives you an idea of {{who is going to be}} the baddest, or one of the baddest, girls in the house. This altercation draws in many viewers and keeps them wondering what will happen next.|$|E
