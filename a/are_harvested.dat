5|$|Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa) <b>are</b> <b>harvested</b> from an {{estimated}} 250,000400,000 trees per year. Highly valued edible nut {{used in the}} confectionery and baking trades. Excellent dietary source of selenium.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} more {{mushroom}} species that <b>are</b> <b>harvested</b> from the wild for personal consumption or commercial sale. Milk mushrooms, morels, chanterelles, truffles, black trumpets, and porcini mushrooms (Boletus edulis) (also known as king boletes) demand a high price on the market. They are often used in gourmet dishes.|$|E
5|$|Those species {{endemic to}} a very limited area are often most {{threatened}} by the collection of plants from the wild. D. madagascariensis is considered endangered in Madagascar because of the large-scale removal of plants from the wild for exportation; 10 - 200 million plants <b>are</b> <b>harvested</b> for commercial medicinal use annually.|$|E
30|$|The fruits <b>were</b> <b>harvested</b> during June 2011 and 2012 {{following}} 18 and 30  months of plantation. All {{the fruits}} from each plot <b>were</b> <b>harvested,</b> counted and weighed.|$|R
5000|$|Bancha (番茶) is a Japanese green tea. It <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> {{from the}} second flush of sencha between summer and autumn. (The first flush <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> for shincha.) ...|$|R
50|$|P. pollicipes <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> for {{consumption}} {{in many parts}} of its range, mostly for the Spanish market, where it may sell for as much as €90 per kilogram. As a result, the species is thought to be in decline. It <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> manually, and archaeological evidence suggests that the species has <b>been</b> <b>harvested</b> in this way for over 10,000 years.|$|R
5|$|Chlamys hastata, {{the spear}} scallop, spiny scallop or {{swimming}} scallop, is {{a species of}} bivalve mollusc in the family Pectinidae found {{on the west coast}} of North America from the Gulf of Alaska to San Diego, California. A limited number of these scallops <b>are</b> <b>harvested</b> by divers or by narrow trawls off the west coast of Canada.|$|E
5|$|For cut flowers, bulbs {{larger than}} 12cm in size are preferred. To bloom in December, bulbs <b>are</b> <b>harvested</b> in June to July, dried, stored {{for four days}} at 34°C, two weeks at 30 and two weeks at 17–20°C and then placed in cold storage for {{precooling}} at 9 degrees for about 15–16 weeks. The bulbs are then planted in light compost in crates in a greenhouse for forcing at 13°C–15°C and the blooms appear in 19–30 days.|$|E
5|$|For potted flowers a lower {{temperature}} {{is used for}} precooling (5°C for 15 weeks), followed by 16°C–18°C in a greenhouse. For later blooming (mid- and late-forcing), bulbs <b>are</b> <b>harvested</b> in July to August and the higher temperatures are omitted, being stored a 17–20°C after harvesting and placed in cold storage at 9°C in September for 17–18 (cut flowers) or 14–16 (potted flowers) weeks. The bulbs can then be planted in cold frames, and then forced in a greenhouse according to requirements.|$|E
50|$|The chikutoh {{sugarcane}} <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> between December and February. It <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> late in {{the year}} on purpose, to allow the sugar content of the cane to develop to its maximum.|$|R
30|$|Plants from maize {{treatments}} <b>were</b> <b>harvested</b> 52 DAE (end of vegetative stage) for {{measurements of}} plant components. Plants from wheat treatments <b>were</b> <b>harvested</b> 54 DAE (end of vegetative stage) for measurements of plant components.|$|R
50|$|Wild grapes <b>were</b> <b>harvested</b> by foragers {{and early}} farmers. For {{thousands}} of years, the fruit has <b>been</b> <b>harvested</b> for both medicinal and nutritional value; its history is intimately entwined {{with the history}} of wine.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} whales are still subject to direct hunting, despite the 1986 {{moratorium}} ban on whaling set {{under the terms}} of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). There are only two nations remaining which sanction commercial whaling: Norway, where several hundred common minke whales <b>are</b> <b>harvested</b> each year; and Iceland, where quotas of 150 fin whales and 100 minke whales per year are set. Japan also harvests several hundred Antarctic and North Pacific minke whales each year, ostensibly for scientific research in accordance with the moratorium. However, the illegal trade of whale and dolphin meat is a significant market in Japan and some countries.|$|E
5|$|An even {{checkerboard}} plot model {{dominates the}} green landscape {{during the rainy}} season, which becomes more austere after harvest. The rice fields differ {{only in terms of}} soil type and location. Where mangroves are populous, such as in Carabane, the rice paddy fields between them must be protected from the channels of saltwater which overflow during high tide. Rice farmers must therefore build levees, dig ditches, and create ponds. The fish and shrimp which subsequently become trapped <b>are</b> <b>harvested</b> {{at the end of the}} rainy season, when the basins are emptied. The plots of land which were safeguarded from flooding are then cleared and ploughed. Several years of drainage are required to desalinate the soil.|$|E
5|$|Authentic bird's nest soup is {{made from}} the nests of the edible-nest swiftlet (or white-nest swiftlet), Aerodramus fuciphagus, and the black-nest swiftlet, Aerodramus maximus. Instead of {{incorporating}} twigs, feathers and straw like others in the genus, these two swiftlets make their nest only from strands of their gummy saliva, which harden when exposed to air. Once the nests <b>are</b> <b>harvested,</b> they are cleaned and sold to restaurants. Over the past twenty years, the high demand for the nests of these Aerodramus species has had an adverse effect on their populations. The Niah caves population of black-nest swiftlets plunged from around 1.5 million pairs in 1959 to 150,000–298,000 pairs in the early 1990s through over-harvesting.|$|E
50|$|Fruit <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> locally for {{pies and}} jams. The saskatoon berry <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> commercially. One {{version of the}} Native American food pemmican was flavored by {{serviceberry}} fruits in combination with minced dried meat and fat.|$|R
50|$|Biomass <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> by {{constructing}} biomass farms {{on top of}} survivor compounds, {{which can}} also create Bio-thralls; units which can be sacrificed inside an egg, resulting in a stronger hatched creature. Biomass can also <b>be</b> <b>harvested</b> from enemy and friendly corpses.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} strains of {{sweetgrass}} — a regular strain that can <b>be</b> <b>harvested</b> {{once or twice}} a year, and a naturally occurring polyploid strain, which is much faster growing and can <b>be</b> <b>harvested</b> three to five times a year.|$|R
5|$|Bulbs <b>are</b> <b>harvested</b> {{for market}} in the summer, sorted, stored for 2 – 3 weeks, and then further {{disinfected}} by a hot (43.5°C) bath. This eliminates infestations by narcissus fly and nematodes. The bulbs are then dried at a high temperature, and then stored at 15.5°C. The initiation of new flower development in the bulb takes place in late spring before the bulbs are lifted, and is completed by mid summer while the bulbs are in storage. The optimal temperature for initiation is 20°C followed by cooling to 13°C.|$|E
5|$|Cowpeas {{are grown}} mostly for their edible beans, {{although}} the leaves, green peas and green pea pods {{can also be}} consumed, meaning the cowpea {{can be used as}} a food source before the dried peas <b>are</b> <b>harvested.</b> Like other legumes, cowpea grain is cooked to make it edible, usually by boiling. Cowpeas can be prepared in stews, soups, purees and casseroles, but the most common way to eat them is in curries. They can also be processed into a paste or flour. Chinese long beans can be eaten raw or cooked, but as they easily become waterlogged are usually sautéed, stir-fried, or deep-fried.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these reports}} of toxicity, L.torminosus {{mushrooms}} are prepared in Finland, Russia, and other northern and eastern European countries by parboiling, soaking in brine for several days, or pickling, after {{which it is}} valued for its peppery taste. In Norway, it is roasted and added to coffee. Mushrooms <b>are</b> <b>harvested</b> for commercial sale in Finland. The nutrient composition of Finnish specimens has been analyzed and found to contain the following components (as a percentage of dry weight): protein, 17.2%; phosphorus, 0.46%; calcium, 0.12%; magnesium, 0.088%; potassium, 2.97%; sodium 0.011%.|$|E
5000|$|J. kraussii <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> and weaved {{to produce}} {{traditional}} sleeping mats, baskets, beer strainers, and other craftwork items in many Zulu areas of South Africa. The plant is in great demand {{because of its}} economic value and has <b>been</b> extensively <b>harvested</b> in the wild. It is now cultivated in many areas and <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> yearly {{for a period of}} seven years in total.|$|R
5000|$|For use in oil {{production}} the olive <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> in mid-November. Fruits {{for use as}} table olives, on the other hand, can <b>be</b> <b>harvested</b> up until May. The fully ripe olives have [...] "a dark colour that ranges from black brownish-purple to brownish-black".|$|R
50|$|Gaoshan {{tea leaves}} <b>are</b> usually hand <b>harvested,</b> and grow slowly {{due to the}} thin air in high altitudes. Hence, the yield of gaoshan tea is {{relatively}} low every year. There {{are two kinds of}} gaoshan tea based on the season: winter gaoshan <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> during late October, and spring gaoshan <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> during the middle of June.|$|R
5|$|Fishing {{takes place}} in coastal towns, {{especially}} in Gampo-eup in the city's northeast, with 436 registered fishing craft in the city. Fishing industry in Gyeongju is generally in a declined status due to relatively inconvenient transport conditions and lacks of subordinate facilities. Much of the catch from these boats goes direct from the harbor to Gyeongju's many seafood restaurants. Mainly, sauries, anchovies, rays <b>are</b> <b>harvested</b> and {{a small number of}} abalone and wakame farming takes place. Local specialties include myeolchijeot (fermented anchovy), abalone, wakame, and squid.|$|E
5|$|Onions may {{be grown}} from seed or from sets. Onion seeds are {{short-lived}} and fresh seeds germinate better. The seeds are sown thinly in shallow drills, thinning {{the plants in}} stages. In suitable climates, certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter {{in the ground and}} produce early crops the following year. Onion sets are produced by sowing seed thickly in early summer in poor soil and the small bulbs produced <b>are</b> <b>harvested</b> in the autumn. These bulbs are planted the following spring and grow into mature bulbs later in the year. Certain cultivars are used for this purpose and these may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed.|$|E
5|$|The carrot is a {{biennial}} {{plant in}} the umbellifer family Apiaceae. At first, it grows a rosette of leaves while building up the enlarged taproot. Fast-growing cultivars mature within three months (90 days) of sowing the seed, while slower-maturing cultivars <b>are</b> <b>harvested</b> four months later (120 days). The roots contain high quantities of alpha- and beta-carotene, and are {{a good source of}} vitamin K and vitamin B6, but the belief that eating carrots improves night vision is a myth put forward by the British in World War II to mislead the enemy about their military capabilities.|$|E
5000|$|Raw {{materials}} can <b>be</b> <b>harvested</b> in space. Each tile, or [...] "field", has a raw material associated with it; for example, open space contains hydrogen fuel, and asteroid fields contain ore. Each field holds {{a maximum of}} 500 units (tons) of its respective material. However, the more a field <b>is</b> <b>harvested,</b> the slower the field regenerates, and the less can <b>be</b> <b>harvested</b> from the field unless it is given sufficient time to regenerate. This often leads to fields that are [...] "strip-mined", meaning raw materials are very scarce or in insufficient quantities to <b>be</b> <b>harvested.</b> Strip-mined fields <b>are</b> {{one of the most}} common difficulties encountered by players in the more populated areas of the universe. Also, players who strip-mine may find themselves an enemy of other pilots.|$|R

50|$|The Manytooth conger <b>is</b> <b>harvested</b> by {{subsistence}} fisheries.|$|R
5|$|The {{greens are}} edible as a leaf vegetable, but are rarely eaten by humans; some sources {{suggest that the}} greens contain toxic alkaloids. When used for this purpose, they <b>are</b> <b>harvested</b> young in {{high-density}} plantings, before significant root development, and typically used stir-fried, or in salads. Some people are allergic to carrots. In a 2010 study on the prevalence of food allergies in Europe, 3.6 percent of young adults showed some degree of sensitivity to carrots. Because the major carrot allergen, the protein Dauc c 1.0104, is cross-reactive with homologues in birch pollen (Bet v 1) and mugwort pollen (Art v 1), most carrot allergy sufferers are also allergic to pollen from these plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{tertiary}} sector comprises {{services such as}} transport, storage, communications, tourism, banking, insurance and real estate. In 2011–2012, it contributed 63.22% of the state's GDP, agriculture and allied sectors contributed 15.73%, while manufacturing, construction and utilities contributed 21.05%. Nearly half of Kerala's people depend on agriculture alone for income. Around 600 varieties of rice, which is Kerala's most used staple and cereal crop, <b>are</b> <b>harvested</b> from 3105.21km2; a decline from 5883.4km2 in 1990. 688,859tonnes of rice are produced per year. Other key crops include coconut; 899,198ha, tea, coffee; 23% of Indian production, or 57,000 tonnes, rubber, cashews, and spices—including pepper, cardamom, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg.|$|E
5|$|Where {{medicinal}} plants <b>are</b> <b>harvested</b> {{from the wild}} rather than cultivated, {{they are subject to}} both general and specific threats. General threats include climate change and habitat loss to development and agriculture. A specific threat is over-collection to meet rising demand for medicines. A case in point was the pressure on wild populations of the Pacific yew soon after news of taxol's effectiveness became public. The threats could be addressed by cultivation of some {{medicinal plants}}, or by a system of certification to make wild harvesting sustainable.|$|E
