Kenney went over the reasons why he thought he should go, ending with [...] "They were my kids <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to see them do their stuff." [...] MacArthur replied [...] "You’re right, George, we’ll both go. They’re my kids, too." ...|$|E
500|$|Sonia was {{diagnosed}} with type 1 diabetes at age seven, and began taking daily insulin injections. Her father died of heart problems at age 42, when she was nine years old. After this, she became fluent in English. Sotomayor has {{said that she was}} first inspired by the strong-willed Nancy Drew book character, and then after her diabetes diagnosis led doctors to suggest a different career from detective, she was inspired to go into a legal career and become a judge by watching the Perry Mason television series. [...] She reflected in 1998: [...] "I was going to college <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to become an attorney, and I knew that when I was ten. Ten. That's no jest." ...|$|E
500|$|Vernon Gholston did {{not play}} {{football}} at Cass until his sophomore year and {{did not play}} on defense (at linebacker) until his senior year. Gholston did not even see himself as a football player {{when he was in}} high school, yet he has gone on to become an Ohio State Buckeyes football defensive end, the 2007 Big Ten Conference Defensive lineman of the year and the sixth overall selection in the 2008 NFL Draft. [...] According to Gholston, [...] "It was between periods <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to my next class. ...He thought I was actually somebody’s father walking down the hall. He asked me whom was I looking for. I was like, 'Nobody. I go here.' He really couldn't believe it. He kind of grabbed me at that point and put me on the team." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Tim Minear and [...] Vince Gilligan, and {{directed}} by Daniel Sackheim. Minear's original idea for the episode involved a convicted criminal {{who happened to be}} an atheist. While in prison, he would have heard the voice of God, commanding him to kill a truly evil man, and then he would have suddenly found himself mystically transferred out of the prison. Although the police would be after him, only Mulder would believe he was working for the greater good. Minear noted that [...] "I pitched it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do it, eventually, until we found ourselves at a point in the year where we needed a script really fast." [...] Executive producer Frank Spotnitz suggested to Minear that the [...] "convicted atheist" [...] should actually be Robert Modell from the third season episode [...] "Pusher". After this was decided, Minear put aside the [...] "Word of God" [...] story, as it was called, teamed up with Gilligan, and the two wrote the final script.|$|E
500|$|... "Watch n' Learn" [...] {{was written}} by Priscilla Renea, Chauncey Hollis, Rihanna and Alja Jackson. The {{production}} of the song was helmed by Hollis under his stage-name Hit-Boy. Hollis had previously worked with music artists like Lil Wayne, The Throne, Eminem and Jennifer Lopez. [...] "Watch n' Learn" [...] wasn't originally meant for any particular artist when Hit-Boy started to work on it. In an interview with Jocelyn Vena from MTV News he explained: [...] "I was at the studio with this amazing [...] Priscilla Renea, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to tell her to go home, but I was like, 'Stay here {{and see if you}} could come up with an idea for this '". Renea previously penned Rihanna's 2011 single [...] "California King Bed" [...] (Loud, 2010). Hollis further explained that by the time he left the studio and came home, Renea already sent him the idea and concept for the song through IChat. He was eventually satisfied with it and sent the song to Rihanna, in which her team [...] "went crazy" [...] when they heard it. [...] Rihanna then recorded the song for inclusion on her sixth studio album Talk That Talk (2011).|$|E
500|$|The {{characters}} and their stories {{served as an}} extension of the fantasy life Bannon developed as a child. They became her [...] "fantasy friends" [...] whose loves and lives she witnessed and through which she lived her own life vicariously, helping her through a difficult marriage, and a longing for a life she did not feel she was free to live. [...] "I realized very early that I should not marry, but I was going to make the best of a bad thing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to make it a good thing," [...] she remembered. Having no practical experience in a lesbian relationship while writing Odd Girl Out, she set out to gain what she termed [...] "fieldwork experience" [...] in her trips to Greenwich Village, and was successful enough to introduce those experiences into the next book in the series before relocating once more to Southern California. But she explained her fears about staying in Greenwich Village, saying I would sit there (in a gay bar) in the evenings thinking, 'What if (a police raid) happens tonight and I get hauled off to the slam with all these other women?' I had been extremely low profile, very proper, very Victorian wife. I know that sounds crazy in the 60s, but I was raised by my mother and grandmother, who really came out of that era, and talk about a rigid role-playing crowd! I couldn't imagine living through it. I just couldn't. I thought, 'Well, that would do it. I'd have to go jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.' As easy as it might be if you were a young woman in today's generation to think that was exaggerating, it wasn't. It was terrifying.|$|E

500|$|The {{team working}} on the film {{commuted}} between the project and the series, pushing both to scheduling extremes (changes to Bigger, Longer & Uncut were made as late as two weeks before its release) and fighting constantly with Paramount. [...] "They wanted a Disney kind of trailer. We said no. They put together a totally un-South Park MTV video for the song 'What Would Brian Boitano Do?'. We had to go make our own version." [...] Paramount's first trailer for the film advertised it, according to Parker, as [...] "the laughiest movie of the summer", and promoted {{it in a way}} that South Park [...] "was completely against". Parker and Stone told the studio of their dissatisfaction with the trailer, and upon the creation of a second trailer with minimal changes, the two broke the videocassette in half and sent it back in its original envelope. [...] "It was war," [...] said Stone in 2000. [...] "They were saying, 'Are you telling us how to do our job?' <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going,</b> 'Yes, because you're fucking stupid and you don't know what you're doing.'" [...] In another instance, Paramount took the songs from the film and created a music video to be aired on MTV. In accordance with broadcast standards, the studio cut various [...] "R-rated" [...] parts out and edited it into what Parker described as a [...] "horrible little medley with all humor absent". The studio sent the original tape to Parker and Stone over a weekend, with plans to send it to MTV on Monday to prepare it for airtime beginning Wednesday. Stone instead put the tape in the trunk of his car and went home. Paramount threatened to sue Parker and Stone in response. Parker also noted that the title was an obvious innuendo, and [...] "they (the MPAA) just didn't get it".|$|E
2500|$|Mark E. Smith was a Glitter fan. [...] "I {{was really}} into Gary Glitter, and I {{used to get}} bad-mouthed for it.

Well, two drummers and all that– it was really percussive. It was the only decent thing around", the Fall {{frontman}} said in 1993, speaking to NME.|$|E
2500|$|Gresham {{was born}} in Spartanburg County, South Carolina, to Claude Gresham Sr. and the former Belle Hill. He {{inherited}} his nickname from his father, a semi-professional baseball player known as [...] "Grit". Gresham grew up in rural South Carolina. As a small boy, he was so interested in hunting that he slept with his air rifle beside his bed. He took his first shot of the day out of his bedroom window. [...] "Two {{things were going to}} happen every day when I was growing up. The sun was going to rise, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to shoot something," [...] Gresham said in a 1996 interview.|$|E

2500|$|Reddy's stardom was {{solidified}} {{when her}} single [...] "I Am Woman" [...] reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in December 1972. The song was co-written by Reddy with Ray Burton; Reddy has attributed {{the impetus for}} writing [...] "I Am Woman" [...] and her early awareness of the women's movement to expatriate Australian rock critic and pioneer feminist Lillian Roxon. Reddy is quoted in Fred Bronson's The Billboard Book of Number One Hits as saying that {{she was looking for}} songs to record which reflected the positive self-image she had gained from joining the women's movement, but could not find any, so [...] "I realized that the song I was looking for didn't exist, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to have to write it myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{basically}} raised myself," [...] Mayweather says. [...] "My grandmother {{did what}} she could. When she got mad at me I'd go to my mom's house. My life was ups and downs." [...] His father says he knows how much pain his incarceration caused his son, but insists he did the best he could. [...] "I sent him {{to live with his}} grandmother," [...] he says. [...] "It wasn't like I left him with strangers." [...] In the absence of his father, boxing became an outlet for Mayweather. As the elder Mayweather served his time, his son put all of his energy into boxing and dropped out of high school. [...] "I knew that I {{was going to have to}} try to take care of my mom and I made the decision that school wasn't that important at the time <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to have to box to earn a living," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|The 20/20 Experience was {{produced}} in a span of 20 days. Recording sessions for The 20/20 Experience began in the [...] "late part of May, first week in June" [...] and concluded in July 2012. [...] The album was recorded at EastWest Studios in Los Angeles, Jungle City Studios in New York City and Larrabee Studios in North Hollywood. Of Timbaland's participation, Wright said: [...] "(Their) relationship is like a brotherhood; they're just so comfortable with each other– not only as musical friends but as personal friends... {{that you can get}} things done {{in a short period of}} time. Had (the Affleck movie) not happened, we might have actually set up and put the album out sooner." [...] After recording was finished, Timberlake and Wright, with M2M Construction, begin [...] "formulating plans for how to release the music". Justin Timberlake, and most of the band used JH Audio in-ear monitoring systems. With regards to the album's lead single [...] "Suit & Tie", Timberlake shared with 97.1 AMP Radio/Los Angeles how the classic, [...] "Get out your seat, Hov" [...] lyric was born inside the studio with JAY-Z: [...] "I had finished the verses <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> in to record them and he was sitting in the room working, freestyling to himself. And then he came up with a line he really liked and he jumped out of his seat and he said, 'Uh oh! Get out of that seat, Hov.' And I just thought it was so funny. It made me laugh. I was standing right beside him when he did it and so I just put it on the record, more or less as a joke to him." [...] Timberlake added that the song harkens back to the glory years of the Rat Pack. [...] "Not to compare ourselves to those guys, but just the fun that they had," [...] he said. [...] "I was picturing like, being at the Sands in Vegas and saying, 'Oh, JAY-Z's in the house tonight. Uh, let's have him come up and do a number. Why don't you go ahead and get out of your seat, Hov?' That's more or less where it came from." ...|$|E
