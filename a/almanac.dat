These modern <b>almanacs</b> are known as Dṛk Pañcāṅgas ( [...] or Thirukanitha Pañcāṅgas).|$|R
5|$|During the Enlightenment, {{intellectual}} {{sympathy for}} astrology fell away, {{leaving only a}} popular following supported by cheap almanacs. One English <b>almanac</b> compiler, Richard Saunders, followed {{the spirit of the}} age by printing a derisive Discourse on the Invalidity of Astrology, while in France Pierre Bayle's Dictionnaire of 1697 stated that the subject was puerile. The Anglo-Irish satirist Jonathan Swift ridiculed the Whig political astrologer John Partridge.|$|E

5|$|The Grolier Codex (sometimes {{referred}} to as the Sáenz Codex) is a Maya book of a pre-Columbian type but of disputed authenticity. It first appeared in a private collection in the 20th century and was displayed at the Grolier Club in New York, hence its name. The codex consists of a fragment of a Maya book, containing almanacs of Venus represented in a simplistic fashion. The Grolier Codex would be only the fourth surviving pre-Columbian Maya book if genuine. The codex {{is said to have been}} recovered from a cave in the Mexican state of Chiapas in the 1960s, together with a mosaic mask and some blank pages of pre-Columbian fig-bark paper. It was displayed at the Grolier Club from April 20 to June 5, 1971, and is now held in Mexico City. In 1973, Michael D. Coe published the first half-size recto-side facsimile of the codex in The Maya Scribe and His World, produced by the Grolier Club. The codex contains a Venus <b>almanac</b> that, in structure, is closely related to the Venus <b>almanac</b> contained in the Dresden Codex.|$|E

5|$|Some {{accounts}} of Nostradamus's life state {{that he was}} afraid of being persecuted for heresy by the Inquisition, but neither prophecy nor astrology fell in this bracket, and he would have been in danger only if he had practised magic to support them. In 1538 he came into conflict with the Church in Agen after an Inquisitor visited the area looking for Anti-Catholic views. His brief imprisonment at Marignane in late 1561 was solely because he had violated a recent royal decree by publishing his 1562 <b>almanac</b> without the prior permission of a bishop.|$|E
5|$|Because of the precessional {{motion of}} the equinox, the {{ecliptic}} coordinates of objects on the celestial sphere are continuously changing. Specifying a position in ecliptic coordinates requires specifying a particular equinox, that is, the equinox of a particular date, known as an epoch; the coordinates are referred to {{the direction of the}} equinox at that date. For instance, the Astronomical <b>Almanac</b> lists the heliocentric position of Mars at 0h Terrestrial Time, 4 Jan 2010 as: longitude 118° 09' 15".8, latitude +1° 43' 16".7, true heliocentric distance 1.6302454 AU, mean equinox and ecliptic of date. This specifies the mean equinox of 4 Jan 2010 0h TT as above, without the addition of nutation.|$|E
5|$|Folk-rock {{drew on the}} {{sporadic}} mainstream {{success of}} groups like the Kingston Trio and the <b>Almanac</b> Singers, while Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger helped to politically radicalize rural white folk music. The popular musician Bob Dylan rose to prominence {{in the middle of}} the 1960s, fusing folk with rock and making the nascent scene closely connected to the Civil Rights Movement. He was followed by a number of country-rock bands like The Byrds and the Flying Burrito Brothers and folk-oriented singer-songwriters like Joan Baez and the Canadian Joni Mitchell. However, by the end of the decade, there was little political or social awareness evident in the lyrics of pop-singer-songwriters like James Taylor and Carole King, whose self-penned songs were deeply personal and emotional.|$|E

50|$|Perlach {{is notable}} for {{his support of}} the use of <b>almanacs,</b> having lectured on their {{importance}} and usage. His lectures were printed in outline form in 1519 and in full commentary in 1551. He also composed annual astrological <b>almanacs</b> for most of his career.|$|R
50|$|For a long period, he {{was unable}} to find employment, so he had to earn his living through the {{publication}} of Almanacs/ Calendars. He was assisted in the calculations by his second wife and their children. A few series of <b>almanacs</b> appeared across several decades. For a time, he published up to 13 <b>almanacs</b> a year, a few appearing under pseudonyms and he also continued established <b>almanacs</b> from other authors under their name. As examples could be cited Christian-, Jewish- und Turkish-Almanac, the Gipsy-Almanac the Sibylla Ptolemaein, a Gipsywoman from Alexandria in Egypten, the Astronomischen Wunder-Kalender, the Wahrhaftigen Himmels-Boten, the Gespenster- und Haushaltungs-Kalender by Johann Friedrich von Rosenfeld / Der Astronomiae Ergebener and from 1700 the various Academy <b>Almanacs</b> as 'Astronomer Royal' in Berlin.|$|R

After being named in Australian rugby's team of the century in 1999, he was given a plaque on the Sydney Cricket Ground's Walk of Honour. In 2005 he was honoured as one of the inaugural five inductees into the Australian Rugby Union Hall of Fame, and in 2013 was named as an inaugural inductee in Inside Rugbys Invincibles.|$|E
5|$|In 1614, German {{astronomer}} Johannes Kepler {{determined that}} {{a series of three}} conjunctions of the planets Jupiter and Saturn occurred in the year 7 BC. He argued (incorrectly) that a planetary conjunction could create a nova, which he linked to the Star of Bethlehem. Modern calculations show that there was a gap of nearly a degree (approximately twice a diameter of the moon) between the planets, so these conjunctions were not visually impressive. An ancient <b>almanac</b> has been found in Babylon which covers the events of this period, but does not indicate that the conjunctions were of any special interest. In the 20th century, Prof. Karlis Kaufmanis, an astronomer, argued that this was an astronomical event where Jupiter and Saturn were in a triple conjunction in the constellation Pisces. Archaeologist and Assyriologist Simo Parpola has also suggested this explanation.|$|E
5|$|Lying {{near the}} constellation's {{northern}} border with Telescopium is Alpha Pavonis, {{the brightest star}} in Pavo. Its proper name — Peacock — is an English translation of the constellation's name. It was assigned by the British Her Majesty's Nautical <b>Almanac</b> Office in the late 1930s; the Royal Air Force insisted that all bright stars must have names, the star hitherto having lacked a proper name. Alpha has an apparent (or visual) magnitude of 1.91 and spectral type B2IV. It is a spectroscopic binary system, one estimate placing the distance between the pair of stars as 0.21 astronomical units (AU), or half the distance between Mercury and the Sun. The two stars rotate around each other in a mere 11 days and 18 hours. The star system is located around 180 light years away from Earth.|$|E

50|$|Jan Franco (active 1586-1611) was a physician, {{mathematician}} and astronomer who compiled <b>almanacs.</b> He {{was born}} in the village of Eersel in the Duchy of Brabant and studied medicine at the University of Leuven. He settled in Brussels to practice medicine and was given the freedom of the city. He was a practicing physician at least until 1594. As he had studied both medicine and mathematics, he was asked to calculate the ephemerides, for purposes of medical astrology. This led to his work as a compiler of <b>almanacs</b> from 1586 to 1611. From 1612 <b>almanacs</b> were printed {{on the basis of his}} drafts but completed for publication by his son, Jan Franco jr., and by Johannes Regius. As late as 1616 <b>almanacs</b> prepared by others were being sold on the strength of his name.|$|R

In 2012, the National Journal gave McCain a composite score of 73% conservative and 27% liberal. In 2013, the National Journal gave him a composite score of 60% conservative and 40% liberal.|$|E
5|$|The {{pages of}} the Grolier Codex contain seven hieroglyphs {{representing}} days; the style of these glyphs {{differs from that of}} the other three Maya codices but is most similar to the glyphs of the Dresden Codex. The glyphs are arranged in vertical columns incorporating day signs accompanied by a number; each date corresponds to a manifestation of Venus. Whereas the Venus <b>almanac</b> in the Dresden Codex documents the planet after inferior conjunction as the morning star, the Grolier Codex documents all four of the stations of Venus: rising after inferior conjunction as morning star in the east, disappearance before superior conjunction, reappearance as evening star in the west and disappearance before inferior conjunction.|$|E
