40|$|AbstractHydraulic model {{tests of}} the intake {{structure}} of Beyhan 1 Dam having four units were carried out at Hydromechanics Laboratory of Middle East Technical University, Ankara. In order to investigate the flow pattern, and formation, development and dissipation of vortices at the intake structure under different operation conditions of the units, and to determine the types of anti-vortex devices to avoid the air-entraining vortices, a model of 1 / 29. 43 length scale was constructed. The model area covers an about 200 m × 300 m section of the Beyhan 1 reservoir, the intake structure having four units, the trash racks and penstocks. Experiments were carried out at various reservoir water levels with specified unit operation discharges for various unit operation conditions. From the observations and experimental results, {{it was concluded that}} air-entraining vortices were forming at the intakes when the reservoir water level was minimum, RWL= 977. 0 m. Flow separation zones were forming; along the inner lengths of the side walls surrounding the intake structure and behind the trashrack piers at any RWL tested. In order to reduce the strengths of the vortices forming and to prevent the intakes from air-entraining vortices, in {{the first phase of the}} experimental study, several anti-vortex devices; continuous plates constructed on top of the intakes, continuous projected head walls and continuous projected head walls with vertical unit-separation walls were tested under various flow and unit operation conditions to find the <b>anti-vortex</b> <b>device</b> that gave the best performance. It was also stated that the arrangements to be made on the geometries of the side walls and trashrack piers, if possible, will improve the flow conditions at the intakes...|$|E

The capacity and performance of the spillway for variations of the hood inlet length, the conduit slope, the wall thickness and the approach conditions are described. The great effect of vortices on the spillway capacity is shown and <b>anti-vortex</b> <b>devices</b> are developed. Scour {{in the vicinity of}} the hood inlet is determined for various sizes of stone and equations for the scour hole dimensions are presented. A few special inlets were tested, the effect of rounding the entering edge being the principal variation.

40|$|A {{pump station}} {{is a crucial}} flood control {{facility}} for mitigating inundation of urban lowland areas. Securing a site to increase the capacity of a pump station or to maximize the discharge capacity of the pump sump in an urban area is difficult because of various limitations. Moreover, adding a facility to improve the pump capacity of a pump station may affect flow characteristics, e. g., unexpected increases in flow velocity and vorticity, and cause severe problems in pump station operation. To solve those problems, <b>anti-vortex</b> <b>devices</b> (AVDs) have been developed and adopted according to the appropriate design standards. The Korean design criteria for AVDs are based on experience and the standards of other countries {{because of the lack}} of adequate data on AVDs. In this study, flow in the sump was numerically simulated at various AVD heights to obtain data for improving the design and efficiency of a pump station. Consequently, the appropriate height for the AVD and changes in the flow pattern and vortex in the pump sump were determined and compared with 12 cases of inflow conditions with respect to the vertical location...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{phenomenon}} of the free-surface vortex forming over a draining intake is well known, together with its detrimental effects. While analytical solutions have been helpful in clarifying some features of the phenomenon, no extensions have been readily provided in solving instances of practical importance. Therefore, efficient <b>anti-vortex</b> <b>devices</b> have been traditionally conceived by means of physical model studies. However, a numerical simulation of the whole flow field would be nowadays desirable. The proposed numerical solution of the flow field {{is based on an}} axial-symmetric finite volume model, which solves the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on irregular geometries. Boundary conditions include both the Dirichlet and the Neumann type. The mesh is staggered. The numerical scheme is a semi-implicit one, where the terms controlling the diffusion and those controlling the pressure field are discretized implicitly, while the convective terms are approximated via an Euler-Lagrange approach. The discrete version of the continuity equation becomes, by a substitution, a system having the pressure values as the only unknowns. The solution proceeds via an iterative scheme, which solves a symmetric and semi-positive-definite system for the pressure, by a standard pre-conditioned conjugate gradient method. The discrete velocity field at each iteration can then be explicitly obtained. The numerical solution has been verified by the laboratory experimental data obtained by Daggett and Keulegan (1974). This comparison demonstrated that the proposed numerical model is capable of predicting the whole steady flow field. Of special value is the comparison with the radial velocity distribution, which has a typical jet-like profile along the vertical direction. According to the most recent experimental evidence, it seems that the very onset of the vortex can be traced to this special feature of the radial velocity profile...|$|R
40|$|Um modelo em acrílico de uma panela (315 toneladas, ArcelorMittal Tubarão), escala 1 : 7, foi utilizado para simular as condições de vazamento do aço, e avaliar as condições de surgimento do vórtice. O momento da inserção do vórtice no canal de vazamento foi determinado através de sensores foto-elétricos e o {{material}} residual foi pesado de modo a se avaliar o rendimento metálico. A influência do tipo de fluxo residual imposto pelas rotas normais de processamento, tais como RH e IRUT, da vazão de drenagem, além de dispositivos antivórtice foi avaliada. O fluxo residual devido ao processamento em RH e IRUT, bem como o nível inicial de aço na panela não afetaram os resultados. O Volume Residual se mostrou função apenas da vazão. Verificou-se que o fluxo de aço era interrompido pela capacidade de abastecimento radial do canal de saída. Como tal, a utilização de quebradores de vórtice se mostrou contra producente. Simulações realizadas induzindo um fluxo rotacional no fluido de forma a aumentar a propensão ao vórtice permitiram confirmar que a injeção de gás pelo fundo da panela e a utilização de barreiras próximas à região de vazamento contribuem para aumentar o rendimento. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________Abstract: A 1 : 7 scale plexiglas {{model of}} a steelmaking ladle (315 tons, ArcelorMittalTubarão) was built {{in order to assess}} the conditions of vortex formation during the final stages of draining. The vortex was detected by a photo-electric sensor and the mass of residual liquid inside the ladle was evaluated after weighing. The influence of the type of residual flow, as dictated by routes of processing such as: RH degasser, IRUT reactor, as well as the drainage flow rate, in addition to <b>anti-vortex</b> <b>devices,</b> was assessed Residual flow due to RH or IRUT processing as well as the initial level of liquid did not affect the results. The mass of residual liquid at vortex onset was influenced by the flow rate only. At the final stages of drainage, the liquid surface collapse was dictated by the bottom ladle capacity of supplying liquid in the radial direction to the outlet. As a consequence vortex breakers were found deleterious under these set of conditions. A rotational flow was induced in order to increase the likelyhood of vortex formation. In this case gas injection through the pouring nozzle, vortex breakers, slopped bottoms have been found effective...|$|R
