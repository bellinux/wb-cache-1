5|$|Neil Brooks (born 27 July 1962) is an Australian former sprint {{freestyle}} swimmer {{best known}} for winning the 4100m medley relay at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow {{as part of the}} Quietly Confident Quartet. Brooks was as much known for his swimming achievements as he was for disciplinary incidents. He often found himself in conflict with officialdom and threatened with sanctions. His international career ended when he was suspended for drinking 46 cans of beer on the return flight to Australia after the 1986 Commonwealth Games. In retirement, he became a news presenter and sports commentator, but was fired amid <b>alcohol</b> <b>problems.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{writing process}} for Pleasant Dreams began in January 1981. With Sire Records {{management}} being insistent on allowing a celebrity record producer {{to work on}} the album, they hired Graham Gouldman—songwriter and musician for the British band 10cc—to produce the album. Prior to working with Gouldman, the Ramones had been with audio engineer Ed Stasium to record several demos and, though Sire rejected, the band had intended that Steve Lillywhite produce the album. The studio recording process began on March 30, 1981, and initiated several conflicts between band members. This tension was partially due to Dee Dee Ramone's drug addiction. Additionally, Marky Ramone and Joey Ramone were both developing <b>alcohol</b> <b>problems,</b> resulting in the frustration of Johnny Ramone. These conflicts and differences became evident in the song writing, as each song was credited to individual rather than multiple members; Pleasant Dreams was the first album in which writing is acknowledged this way.|$|E

25|$|While alcohol {{initially}} helps ease {{panic disorder}} symptoms, medium- or long-term alcohol abuse can cause panic disorder to develop or worsen during alcohol intoxication, especially during alcohol withdrawal syndrome. This effect {{is not unique}} to alcohol but can also occur with long-term use of drugs which have a similar mechanism of action to alcohol such as the benzodiazepines which are sometimes prescribed as tranquilizers to people with <b>alcohol</b> <b>problems.</b> The reason chronic alcohol misuse worsens panic disorder is due to distortion of the brain chemistry and function.|$|E

40|$|My thesis {{addresses}} {{the nature of}} the longitudinal relationship between depressive symptoms at age 10 years and <b>alcohol</b> <b>problem</b> use at age 14 years. Using data from 4220 participants in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a large population-based UK birth cohort, I examined the impact of relevant covariates on the relationship between these two behaviours and evidence of gender differences; testing furthermore for the moderating effects of peers' influences in this relationship. Childhood depressive symptoms were associated with increased risk of <b>alcohol</b> <b>problem</b> use in early adolescence for girls (O. R. 1. 14, p-value = 0. 016) but not boys. Covariates describing particularly the family and social environment influenced this association for girls. This association becomes smaller when these covariates were taken into account. Having a strong bond with alcohol-drinking peers interacted with depressive symptoms to increase risk of <b>alcohol</b> <b>problem</b> use in 14 year old girls (O. R. 1. 18, p-value = 0. 029). These findings provide support to a Family Interactional theoretical model and corroborate the growing evidence that family-related interventions to reduce alcohol use are particularly effective for girls. Future policy will have to consider that girls who experience high levels of depressive symptoms may be at particular risk of <b>alcohol</b> <b>problem</b> use if they affiliate with a peer group exerting strong pressure to drink.

25|$|Along with Ardent Studios founder John Fry and {{engineer}} Terry Manning, Bell {{is credited}} {{with much of the}} mixing and engineering work done on the first Big Star album, #1 Record. After this album failed to achieve commercial success (partially due to confusion by its soul-oriented distributor Stax in marketing the album), Bell left the band in 1972. He struggled with depression {{for the rest of his}} life. He also dealt with drug and <b>alcohol</b> <b>problems</b> while also becoming deeply immersed in Christianity. According to his brother David, Bell may have left Big Star due to a belief that he was overshadowed by the more famous Chilton.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the war, Lindbæk {{returned}} to Norway, suffering from <b>alcohol</b> <b>problems</b> she had developed during her wartime work. She involved herself in the reconstruction work in Norway's northernmost county Finnmark, which had suffered almost complete destruction in the closing months of the war. She worked as a journalist for the United Nations from 1945 to 1949. Her UN experiences also resulted in the book FN; inntrykk og opplevelser fra Lake Success og Paris, which was published in 1949. In the 1950s, Lindbæk worked as a reporter in Germany, both in East and West Germany. She died in Kiel, Germany in 1961, committing suicide by drowning herself in the sea. Lise Lindbæk was buried in Roskilde, Denmark.|$|E
25|$|Health psychology, {{like other}} areas of applied psychology, is both a {{theoretical}} and applied field. Health psychologists employ diverse research methods. These methods include controlled randomized experiments, quasi-experiments, longitudinal studies, time-series designs, cross-sectional studies, case-control studies, qualitative research as well as action research. Health psychologists study {{a broad range of}} variables including cardiovascular disease, (cardiac psychology), smoking habits, the relation of religious beliefs to health, alcohol use, social support, living conditions, emotional state, social class, and more. Some health psychologists treat individuals with sleep problems, headaches, <b>alcohol</b> <b>problems,</b> etc. Other health psychologists work to empower community members by helping community members gain control over their health and improve quality of life of entire communities.|$|E

25|$|The CAGE questionnaire, {{the name}} of which is an acronym of its four questions, is a widely used {{screening}} test for problem drinking and potential <b>alcohol</b> <b>problems.</b> The questionnaire takes less than one minute to administer, and is often used in primary care or other general settings as a quick screening tool {{rather than as an}} in-depth interview for those who have alcoholism. The CAGE questionnaire does not have a specific intended population, and is meant to find those who drink excessively and need treatment. The CAGE questionnaire is reliable and valid for assessment of alcohol abuse; however, it is not valid for diagnosis of other substance use disorders, although somewhat modified versions of the CAGE questionnaire have been frequently implemented for such a purpose.|$|E
25|$|While alcohol {{initially}} helps {{social phobia}} or panic symptoms, with longer term alcohol misuse can often worsen social phobia symptoms {{and can cause}} panic disorder to develop or worsen, during alcohol intoxication and especially during the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. This effect {{is not unique to}} alcohol but can also occur with long-term use of drugs which have a similar mechanism of action to alcohol such as the benzodiazepines, which are sometimes prescribed as tranquillizers to people with <b>alcohol</b> <b>problems.</b> Approximately half of patients attending mental health services for conditions including anxiety disorders such as panic disorder or social phobia suffer from alcohol or benzodiazepine dependence. It was noted that every individual has an individual sensitivity level to alcohol or sedative hypnotic drugs and what one person can tolerate without ill health another will suffer very ill health and that even moderate drinking can cause rebound anxiety syndromes and sleep disorders. A person who is suffering the toxic effects of alcohol will not benefit from other therapies or medications as they do not address the root cause of the symptoms.|$|E

[...] Babbit wanted the film to represent the lesbian experience from the femme perspective to contrast with several films of the time that represented the butch perspective (for example, Go Fish and The Watermelon Woman). She also wanted to satirize both the religious right and the gay community.|$|E

[...] For much of his career, however, Bissell was plagued with injuries, and there were reports of drug and <b>alcohol</b> <b>problems.</b> Bissell and Gelsey Kirkland were dismissed from the American Ballet Theatre in 1980 and 1981 on the grounds of chronic lateness and missed rehearsalsin particular for failing to attend a dress rehearsal {{on the eve of the}} company's opening at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. on December 9, 1980.

40|$|Background: Mass media {{influence}} public acceptability, {{and hence}} feasibility, {{of public health}} interventions. This study investigates newsprint constructions of the <b>alcohol</b> <b>problem</b> and minimum unit pricing (MUP). Methods: Quantitative content analysis of 901 articles about MUP published in 10 UK and Scottish newspapers between 2005 and 2012. Results: MUP was a high-profile issue, particularly in Scottish publications. Reporting increased steadily between 2008 and 2012, matching the growing status of the debate. The <b>alcohol</b> <b>problem</b> was widely acknowledged, often associated with youths, and portrayed as driven by cheap alcohol, supermarkets and drinking culture. Over-consumption was presented {{as a threat to}} health and social order. Appraisals of MUP were neutral, with supportiveness increasing slightly over time. Arguments focused on health impacts more frequently than more emotive perspectives or business interests. Health charities and the NHS were cited slightly more frequently than alcohol industry representatives. Conclusion: Emphases on efficacy, evidence and experts are positive signs for evidence-based policymaking. The high profile of MUP, along with growing support within articles, could reflect growing appetite for action on the <b>alcohol</b> <b>problem.</b> Representations of the problem as structurally driven might engender support for legislative solutions, although cultural explanations remain common...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess <b>alcohol</b> use <b>problems</b> in {{patients}} with migraine and tension-type headache. Method: We evaluated 81 patients with migraine and 62 patients with tension-type headache. The identification of <b>alcohol</b> consumption <b>problems</b> was carried out with Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). <b>Alcohol</b> use <b>problem</b> was defined as an AUDIT score of 8 or above. The headache impact was calculated with headache impact test (HIT- 6). Results: The proportions of <b>alcohol</b> use <b>problem</b> among patients with migraine and tension-type headache were 5. 2 % and 16. 1 %, respectively (P= 0. 044). The headache impact was significantly higher with migraine than with tension-type headache (P< 0. 0001). There was an inverse correlation between headache impact and AUDIT (P= 0. 043). Conclusions: Our results suggest that migraine patients are less prone to <b>alcohol</b> use <b>problems</b> than tension-type headache patients. One of the possible reasons is that migraine is associated with greater impact than tension-type headache...|$|R
