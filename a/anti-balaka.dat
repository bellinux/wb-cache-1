On 18 February 2014, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon {{called on the}} UN Security Council to immediately deploy 3,000 troops to the country, bolstering the 6,000 African Union soldiers and 2,000 French troops already in the country, to combat civilians being murdered in large numbers. The Séléka government {{was said to be}} divided. and in September 2013, Djotodia officially disbanded Seleka, but many rebels refused to disarm, becoming known as ex-Seleka, and veered further out of government control. It is argued that the focus of the initial disarmament efforts exclusively on the Seleka inadvertently handed the <b>anti-Balaka</b> the upper hand, leading to the forced displacement of Muslim civilians by <b>anti-Balaka</b> in Bangui and western CAR.|$|E

5000|$|Though [...] "anti-balaka" [...] {{is often}} {{translated}} as [...] "antimachete", its origin is explained: {{is from the}} language of the young illiterates, who formed Seleka’s armed opposition, and who chased the Muslim ‘anti-balles à ti laka’ (anti ti laka bullets). The term ‘laka’ in the street language of the Central African Republic means an AK-47. The <b>anti-balakas</b> are therefore the bearers of grigris meant to stop Kalashnikov bullets.|$|R
2500|$|On 11 January 2014, Michael Djotodia and Nicolas Tiengaye {{resigned}} {{as part of}} a deal negotiated at a regional summit in neighboring Chad. [...] Catherine Samba-Panza was elected as interim president by the National Transitional Council, becoming the first ever female Central African president. On 23 July 2014, following Congolese mediation efforts, Séléka and <b>anti-balaka</b> representatives signed a ceasefire agreement in Brazzaville. By the end of 2014, the country was de facto partitioned with the <b>anti-Balaka</b> in the southwest and ex-Seleka [...] in the northeast. On 14 December 2015, Séléka rebel leaders declared an independent Republic of Logone.|$|E
5000|$|While <b>anti-balaka</b> {{groups have}} been {{frequently}} described as Christian militias in the media, this has been denied by Church leaders. Bishop Juan José Aguirre said: [...] "But in no sense can it {{be said that the}} <b>anti-balaka</b> is a Christian group. The <b>anti-balaka</b> are made up of people of all kinds, terribly enraged, and including many people whom we call the 'dispossessed' - bandits, ex-prisoners, delinquents, criminals - who have got involved in these groups and are now extending, like a plague of locusts, across the whole of the CAR, murdering Muslims". The Tony Blair Faith Foundation has also pointed out the presence of animists in <b>anti-balaka</b> groups. However, there have been reports that many members of <b>Anti-balaka</b> groups have forcibly converted Muslims to Christianity.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Anti-balaka</b> are {{a militia}} group {{fighting}} in the Central African Republic composed primarily of Christians. However, some Church leaders have contested the exclusively Christian character of such groups and the Tony Blair Faith Foundation has also pointed out the presence of animists in <b>Anti-balaka</b> groups as has journalist Andrew Katz. They formed in the Central African Republic after the rise to power of Michel Djotodia in 2013. There have been reports that some members of <b>Anti-balaka</b> groups have forcibly converted Muslims to Christianity.|$|E
50|$|On 28 May, Séléka rebels stormed a Catholic church compound, {{killing at}} least 30. On 2 June, the {{government}} banned text messaging, deeming it a security threat, after calls for a general strike were made via SMS. On 23 June, <b>anti-balaka</b> forces killed 18 members of the mostly Muslim village of Bambari. Several young Séléka took revenge against this attack the same day by killing 10 <b>anti-balaka.</b> On 8 July, 17 people were killed when Séléka forces attacked a Catholic church in Bambari, believing that the church was supposedly sheltering <b>anti-balaka</b> troops.|$|E
5000|$|Much of {{the tension}} is over {{religious}} identity between Muslim Seleka fighters and Christian <b>Anti-balaka</b> as well as over historical antagonism between agriculturalists, who largely comprise <b>Anti-balaka</b> and nomadic groups, who largely comprise Seleka fighters and ethnic differences among Exseleka factions. [...] There are over 400,000 displaced people as of 2017.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{efforts to}} disarm both <b>anti-balaka</b> and Séléka symmetrically, massacres {{occurred}} {{in the region of}} Lobaye, where <b>anti-balaka</b> assassinated Muslim civilians and Séléka disarmed by the French. Violence yielded an exodus of the local Muslim population. Saleh Dido, one of the last Muslims in Mbaiki and aid of the mayor for 4 years, declining to flee, is assassinated by anti-balakas.|$|E

While comparisons were often posed as the [...] "next Rwanda", others suggested that the Bosnian Genocide's may be more apt as people were moving into religiously cleansed neighbourhoods. In 2014, Amnesty International reported several massacres committed by the anti-balakas against Muslim civilians, forcing thousands of Muslims to flee the country.

50|$|The {{situation}} in CAR rapidly deteriorated after 5 December 2013, after an attack in Bangui by <b>anti-balaka</b> militias and loyalists of ousted President François Bozizé. The attack against former Séléka rebels sparked widespread violence throughout the capital {{as well as}} in Ouham province in the northwest. The violence marked a significant escalation of the conflict in CAR. <b>Anti-balaka</b> forces launched another attack against Muslim neighborhoods of Bangui on 20 December, spurring a cycle of renewed violence that led to at least 71 deaths by 24 December. A mass grave of at least 30 people who were reportedly executed and exhibited signs of torture was discovered on 25 December. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimates a further 40 civilians were killed on 25 December as violence continued between <b>anti-balaka</b> and ex-Séléka forces. Eight African Union (AU) peacekeepers were also killed between 25 and 26 December.|$|E

5000|$|According to Laurent Correau and Olivier Fourt, journalists at RFI, {{the outcome}} of the {{operation}} is [...] "bitter-sweet". They stated that France had played an important stabilisation role, notably in Bangui and Bouar, and had also secured the supply route between Cameroon and Nagui, but had not managed to really disarm the Seleka and the <b>Anti-Balaka.</b> Furthermore, initially, the disarmament operation targeted mostly the Seleka, leading to a wave of popular violence against then defenceless Muslims. The French might initially have underestimated the threat posed by the <b>anti-balaka.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In May 2014, it was {{reported}} that around 600,000 people in CAR were internally displaced with 160,000 of these in the capital Bangui. The Muslim population of Bangui had dropped from 138,000 to 900. The national health system had collapsed and over half of the total population of 4.6 million were said to be in need of immediate aid. Also from December 2013 to May 2014, 100,000 people had fled to neighbouring Cameroon, Chad and the Democratic Republic of Congo bringing the number of CAR refugees in these countries to about 350,000. Amnesty International blamed the <b>anti-balaka</b> militia of causing a [...] "Muslim exodus of historic proportions. Some Muslims of the country were also weary of the French presence in MISCA, with the French accused of not doing enough to stop attacks by <b>Anti-balaka</b> militias. One of the cited reasons for the difficulty in stopping attacks by <b>anti-balaka</b> militias was the mob nature of these attacks.|$|E
50|$|In March, several {{operations}} were implemented to disarm the <b>Anti-balaka</b> in Bangui. On 10 February, General Francisco Soriano stated The {{people who call}} themselves <b>Anti-balaka</b> have become the main ennemies of peace in the Central African Republic. They are the ones sigmatising communities, {{they are the ones}} aggressing the Sangaris Force. We should not contain them, but hunt them for what they are, that is outlaws and bandits. On 15 February, 250 African and French soldiers conducted a large operation in the anti-balaka-held Boy-Rab neighbourhood. They arrested eight people, including four officers under Patrice Edouard Ngaissona; Ngaissona, however, managed to flee.|$|E

50|$|People’s Resistance Movement for the Refoundation of the Central African Republic (Mouvement de Résistance Populaire pour la Refondation de la Centrafrique; MRPRC) is {{the main}} {{organization}} claiming to be the political representatives of the <b>anti-balaka</b> rebels. It is led by Levy Yakete. In March 2013, President François Bozizé (a Christian) was overthrown in the Central African Republic conflict by a mostly Muslim rebel coalition known as Séléka. The MRPRC was created {{at that time to}} resist the Muslim nomads and restore Bozizé to power.

50|$|Djotodia {{announced}} {{the dissolution of}} the Séléka in September 2013, but most of the militias refused to disband. The Séléka and the <b>anti-balaka</b> engaged in a cycle of increasing violence, including reprisal attacks on individuals believed to be civilians by many.|$|E

50|$|The {{group have}} {{reported}} on weapons and ammunition {{used in the}} CAR on all sides. Stockpiles of ammunition held by the Séléka, finding that some small arms were produced in Sudan, Iran and China. Séléka forces had Belgian, Czech, and UK ammunition manufactured in 2007-10, and Chinese manufactured RPG rounds. Chinese produced 82mm HEAT rounds were consigned to the Military Industry Corporation's Yarmouk complex. Chinese-manufactured grenades used by <b>Anti-balaka</b> forces {{appear to have been}} intended to be shipped to Nepal. <b>Anti-balaka</b> forces use 12-gauge shotgun shells manufactured in Spain, Italy, and Cameroon. The report finds that Chinese made Type 82-2 hand grenades can be bought for under US $1, making them cheaper than a bottle of Coca-Cola.|$|E
50|$|As of February 2014 {{the town}} and region around Bouar were {{experiencing}} ethnic cleansing, principally against Muslim civilians. A French journalist, Camille Lepage, was also killed and her body found in the car of <b>Anti-balaka</b> troops in the Bouar region in May, 2014.|$|E
5000|$|As UN Secretary-General Ban-ki Moon {{warned of}} {{a de facto}} {{partition}} of the country into Muslim and Christian areas {{as a result of}} the sectarian fighting, He also called the conflict an [...] "urgent test" [...] for the UN and the region's states.
