40|$|Background Little {{is known}} {{about the role of the}} <b>assistant</b> <b>grade</b> nurse in the {{clinical}} development of pre-registration nursing students during their practice placements; even less {{is known about}} this relationship in the mental health field. Aim To explore the relationship between <b>assistant</b> <b>grade</b> nurses and mental health nursing students. Methods Using a phenomenological approach, diaries of nine participants – three nursing students, three <b>assistant</b> <b>grade</b> nurses and three mentors – helped to inform semi-structured interviews. The data were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Findings Students recognised that a substantial percentage of their practice was supervised by <b>assistant</b> <b>grade</b> nurses. There was also a clear connection between <b>assistant</b> <b>grade</b> nurse supervision and the delivery of direct care. Conclusion This study has confirmed the existence of a more extensive educational relationship between <b>assistant</b> <b>grade</b> nurses and mental health nursing students than had previously been recognised...|$|E

40|$|Professional {{software}} developers use version control systems {{to coordinate their}} work, and to provide an unwindable history of their project’s evolution. In contrast, students in most programming courses use a homegrown electronic submission program to submit their work, and email to coordinate with partners when doing team projects. In May 2003, we began using CVS, a popular open source version control system, as an assignment submission system. Students receive starter code by checking out the assignment, use the version control system to manage their work, and submit their assignment by committing it to CVS. Teaching <b>assistants</b> <b>grade</b> assignments by checking out each student’s repository, and committing the marks. Our experience to date shows that this is both a simpler and a more flexible way to manage student assignments, and also {{an excellent way to}} teach them how to use a fundamental software development tool...|$|R

40|$|In Fall 2008, UTEP 2 ̆ 7 s {{composition}} department {{implemented a}} pilot program to test a redesign of English 1312, their second-semester freshman composition course. In addition to a redesigned curriculum, a system of electronic distributed assessment was implemented in ten sections of English 1312. Instead of the traditional format of a class where instructors grade all student assignments, a group of teaching <b>assistants</b> <b>graded</b> student writing anonymously using standardized grading rubrics. The system, which has been used at Texas Tech University since 2002, {{was put in place}} at UTEP in order to enhance efficiency and consistency in the teaching of this course. ^ Previous research on electronic distributed assessment has focused on instructor and administrator perspectives on the grading system; comparatively little research has been done on student attitudes toward and performance with electronic distributed assessment. To measure this, two electronic surveys about the grading system were administered to students in the redesigned sections of the course. Student dropout rates and final grades in the redesigned sections of the course were compared with data from traditionally taught sections of the course. Finally, data from group interviews was collected to determine student attitudes toward the electronic distributed assessment system used in the Fall 2008 semester. ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2006 CUPE 3902, {{the trade}} union {{representing}} TAs and sessional lecturers at the UofT, filed a grievance alleging that Joordens was used this programme {{to create a}} pool of [...] "cheap labour" [...] {{as a means of}} avoiding hiring teaching <b>assistants</b> to <b>grade</b> term work for his introductory Psychology class. In January 2009, an arbitrator upheld the grievance—noting, incidentally, that Joordens was actually looking for [...] "free" [...] labour—and ruled that the University of Toronto needed to set aside $283,000 to compensate the more than 1500 students who had been forced by Joordens to work for free.|$|R
