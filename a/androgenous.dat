40|$|Research {{objective}} is to study processes of lithogenesis at patients with considerably cured urolithiasis at androg-enous therapy. The patients observed in urological clinic of Omsk State Medical Academy have been included. By means of method «case-control» 2 groups have been formed : the basic group - 10 patients with considerably cured urolithiasis and with hypogonadism receiving <b>androgenous</b> therapy and the comparison group - 10 patients with considerably cured urolithiasis and with hypogonadism without receiving <b>androgenous</b> therapy. Processes of lithogenesis at patients who received <b>androgenous</b> therapy have proceeded statistically significantly in comparison with patients without receiving <b>androgenous</b> therapy. It has been proved {{that there is a}} negative influence of testosterone deficiency on processes of lithogenesis. The obtained data demonstrate that lithogenic processes at patients with hypogonadism are more expressed and lead to more frequent urolithiasis recurrence. Noninvasiveness, technical simplicity and availability of method «Litos-test» provides its use for express-screening method for inspection of the population and for estimation of antireccurent efficiency of androgen replacement therapy at men with urolithiasi...|$|E
40|$|<b>Androgenous</b> and {{regeneration}} {{abilities of}} 8 heterozygous wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes were analyzed in anther culture. Cytological characteristics of green regenerants were also analyzed. Significant {{differences were found}} among the genotypes in their <b>androgenous</b> and regeneration abilities. The average <b>androgenous</b> capacity of all genotypes was 4. 4 % ranging from 0. 7 % (Prima/Hueguen) to 11. 0 % (NS 173 - 98 /NS 164 - 98). The average callus yield was 8. 7 %. The genotype Banks/F 53 - 70 produced {{the highest number of}} green plants (33 green plants), while the genotype Banks/Pobeda showed no green plant regeneration ability. The frequency of albino plants ranged between 0 % (Banks/Rodna) and 5. 3 % (Anastasija/Radika). A total of 61 green and 61 albino plants were regenerated. The results of cytological analysis showed that, from the total number of regenerated green plants, 40. 9 % were haploids and 59. 1 % were spontaneous double haploids...|$|E
40|$|Feasibility of metal-to-metal <b>androgenous</b> seals {{has been}} demonstrated. Techniques to {{minimize}} surface irregularities must be examined. Two concepts investigated: 1) Flexible metal interface with elastomeric preloader; 2) Flexibility will accommodate any surface irregularities from the mating surface. Rigid metal interface with elastomeric preloader. Rigidity {{of the metal}} surface will prevent irregularities (waves) from occurring...|$|E
40|$|<b>Androgenous</b> and {{regeneration}} {{abilities of}} 14 randomly selected F 1 hybrids of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were analyzed. Anthers were grown in vitro on a modified Potato- 2 inductive medium. The hybrid NS 111 - 95 /Ana {{had the highest}} average values for <b>androgenous</b> capacity (33 %) and callus yield (119 %), while the hybrid NS 92 - 250 /Tiha had the lowest values for these traits (9 and 21 %, respectively). Seven genotypes (50 %) had a frequency of green plants relative {{to the number of}} isolated anthers of over 10 %, with the highest frequency of 21. 3 % (NS 111 - 95 /Sremica). This hybrid produced 12. 8 doubled haploid (DH) lines per spike used for isolation. In the other genotypes, the number of produced DH lines per spike ranged from 1 (30 ­Sc. Smoc. 88 - 89 /Hays- 2) to 11. 2 (NS 111 - 95 /Ana). As half of the randomly selected genotypes exhibited high green plant regeneration ability and a high production of DH lines per spike, it can be concluded that in vitro anther culture can be successfully used in breeding programs for rapid production of homozygous wheat lines...|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} Emilio Fernández’ film Enamorada (1946) {{by taking}} into account how the sexualities of the two main characters, portrayed by Pedro Armendáriz and María Félix, come into play in the director’s construction of a national Mexican imaginary. Why do the gender representations of these two characters edge towards the <b>androgenous?</b> How can this ambivalence be explained {{in the context of}} Mexico’s national culture after the revolution? This paper argues that despite its rather formulaic masculinism, this film surprisingly proposes a more fluid national and sexual identity than has commonly been attributed to Emilio Fernández’s work. The sexualities of this film’s protagonists, portrayed by María Félix and Pedro Armendáriz, embody an ambiguity that reconfigures cultural archetypes and indicates an aperture towards international cultural models...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, 1993 Aside from {{abstinence}} {{condom use}} {{is seen as}} one of the primary methods for the prevention of HIV transmission. This research surveyed 102 sexually active heterosexual college students to assess gender differences in attitudes and behaviors toward condom use and purchase. The Attitude Toward Condoms Scale, various questions from published instruments and experimental questions were utilized. The results of this study describe a more <b>androgenous</b> attitude toward condom use within this population, with males and females indicating a neutral attitude toward condoms. Supporting previous research, this population demonstrates high risk behaviors, practicing unprotected sex with multiple partners. On the factor of embarrassment, however, females were found to be significantly less embarrassed in condom use and purchase than males. In comparison to males, females reported more assertive behaviors regarding condom use. Females indicated that they found males who did not leave contraceptive responsibility up to the female to be sexier...|$|E
40|$|Findings of a {{study that}} {{investigated}} the effect of administrative stressors on administrators ' coping responses {{and the consequences of}} those responses are presented in this paper. Based on the managerial stress cycle model (Gmelch 1982), the study uses the transactional perspective, which views stress as an individual's physiological or psychological response to a perceived demand. A survey mailed to 1, 000 administrators at the elementary, junior, and senior high school and district levels elicited 740 responses, a 74 percent response rate. Findings suggest that: (1) administrators reported a moderate stress level; (2) a significant negative correlation existed between administrator's perceived stress and their perceived coping effectiveness; (3) a significant negative correlation existed between perceived stress factors and burnout; and (4) <b>androgenous</b> individuals (those who possess the flexibility of both gender traits) expressed more effective coping behaviors. The data support the transactional view of the stress cycle. A recommendation is made to provide administrator training that incorporates diverse situations and behavioral adaptability to enhance coping ability. Two figures and five tables are included.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that a high pre-conceptual waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is a good predictor of male offspring and, thus, in cultures that value male children, an <b>androgenous</b> body shape may be judged as most attractive. The predictive value of WHRs is based on studies measuring women who already have children and correlating their WHRs with the proportion of existing male offspring. However, carrying a male child may alter WHRs in a different way to carrying a female child, and a high WHR may be an effect rather than a cause of male offspring. In order to test the predictive power of a pre-conceptual WHR and offspring gender, we took WHR measures from 458 women who intended to become pregnant and then correlated this with the genders of their subsequent children. We found no significant correlation. It is therefore not clear why a high WHR is preferred in some cultures. We suggest that differences in attractiveness preferences between different ethic groups are actually based on weight scaled for height (the body mass index or BMI) rather than the WHR since although there will be a preferred optimal BMI for each ethnic group, which will balance environmental and health factors, this optimal BMI may differ between groups and environments...|$|E

40|$|Both the {{political}} and philosophical foundations of the modern movement of women 2 ̆ 7 s emancipation are found in several early political treaties including Mary Wollstonecraft 2 ̆ 7 s (1798) A Vindication of the Rights of Women, John Smart Mill 2 ̆ 7 s (1869 / 1966) The Subjection of Women, and Engels 2 ̆ 7 (various, reprinted 1884 / 1948) The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State. Wollstonecraft and Mill base their position on abstract considerations of morality and justice. The Marxist view, as expressed in Engels 2 ̆ 7 work, proposed {{that as long as}} a powerful advantaged social (capitalist) class (almost entirely male) benefited from the fruits of the labor of others (men and women of the proletariat) philosophical concepts of equality and justice were also abstract and thus not achievable. Concern 2 ̆ 7 s about women 2 ̆ 7 s exploitation appears in many places in the writings of Marx and Engels. Although oversimplified, an early socialist view purports that matriarchy was the earliest form of the social organization and that the development of patriarchy with its injustice and female exploitation, is not invariant to the human condition. Patriarchy, and later capitalism, developed as a product of economic conditions that included the invention of private property, the enslavement of women, and the exploitation of women 2 ̆ 7 s labor. Engels concluded that: Psychology has in its history recommendations for alteration of the clitoris in order to rectify women 2 ̆ 7 s so-called 2 ̆ 2 sexual problems 2 ̆ 2 (really men 2 ̆ 7 s problems with sexuality). Freud, perhaps the best known proponent of biological determinism in psychology, for advocating the elimination of clitoral sexuality as a necessary precondition for the development of genital sexuality essential to femininity (for an excellent counter discussion to Freud 2 ̆ 7 s sexual determinism, see Hite, 1994). Medical textbooks from the 18002 ̆ 7 s pronounced women 2 ̆ 7 s genital surgery as an appropriate treatment for 2 ̆ 2 nymphomania 2 ̆ 2, 2 ̆ 2 hysteria, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 masturbation 2 ̆ 2, and other sexually deviant behavior among women. Significant work in stereotyping (Franks and Rothblum, 1983) was undertaken in the early 19802 ̆ 7 s demonstrating how the prevailing diagnostic system of mental disorders created definitions of psychopathology that were selectively assigned to the most vulnerable members of society - women, the poor, recent immigrants and ethnic natives. Typologies used to define positive mental health were based on American and European male ideals because they were the engineers of the classification system. While criteria development for the diagnoses of 2 ̆ 2 masochism 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Late Luteal Phase Disorder 2 ̆ 2 was underway, feminist psychologists showed that the personality characteristics of the male power elite were being advanced as superior to ultimately keep women vulnerable, helpless and labeled as crazy (Chesler, 1977; [Caplan, PJ], 1988). Based on empirical studies of psychological well being, feminist theorists proposed abandoning the rigid sex typing system that confined people to narrow definitions of desirable masculine and feminine behavior and replacing it with <b>androgenous</b> conceptions that afforded a wide ranging balance of personality characteristics not determined by one 2 ̆ 7 s biological sex. Casting off deterministic mandates of optimal mental well-being resulted in the automatic 2 ̆ 2 recovery 2 ̆ 2 of the previously diagnosed dysfunctionals...|$|E
