After failing {{to make it into}} the top six of the Under-25 Boys category during super bootcamp, the judges Ronan Keating, Guy Sebastian, Natalie Bassingthwaighte and Mel B decided to put them together to form a boy band for the home visits stage, thus qualifying for the Groups category. During home visits, they travelled to London, England and sang Rihanna's [...] "We Found Love", their first song as a group, in front of their mentor Keating and guest mentors One Direction. Keating later selected them, along with Fourtunate and What <b>About</b> <b>Tonight,</b> for the live finals—a series of ten weekly live shows in which contestants are progressively eliminated by public vote. During the official launch for The X Factor at the Museum for Contemporary Art in Sydney on 13 September 2012, Keating announced that the group would be called The Collective.

6000|$|If {{designing}} {{could be}} taught, {{all the world}} would learn: as all the world reads--or calculates. But designing {{is not to be}} spelled, nor summed. My men continually come to me, in my drawing class in London, thinking I am to teach them what is instantly to enable them to gain their bread. [...] "Please, sir, show us how to design." [...] "Make designers of us." [...] And you, I doubt not, partly expect me to tell you to-night how to make designers of your Bradford youths. Alas! I could as soon tell you how to make or manufacture an ear of wheat, as to make a good artist of any kind. I can analyze the wheat very learnedly for you--tell you there is starch in it, and carbon, and silex. I can give you starch, and charcoal, and flint; but you are as far from your ear of wheat as you were before. All that can possibly be done for any one who wants ears of wheat is to show them where to find grains of wheat, and how to sow them, and then, with patience, in Heaven's time, the ears will come--or will perhaps come--ground and weather permitting. So in this matter of making artists--first you must find your artist in the grain; then you must plant him; fence and weed the field about him; and with patience, ground and weather permitting, you may get an artist out of him--not otherwise. And what I have to speak to you <b>about,</b> <b>tonight,</b> is mainly the ground and the weather, it being the first and quite most material question in this matter, whether the ground and weather of Bradford, or the ground and weather of England in general,--suit wheat.|$|E
