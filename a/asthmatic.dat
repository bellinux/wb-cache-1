40|$|To {{clarify the}} action of IgG {{antibody}} on basophils in intractable <b>asthmatics,</b> morphological changes, density and redistribution of IgG antibodies on basophils were observed by immunoscanning electron microscopy.

40|$|AbstractSputum {{induction}} {{can be used}} {{to study}} airway inflammation in <b>asthmatics.</b> However, it has not been used in patients with corticosteroid-dependent asthma requiring long-term oral corticosteroids.

In the 17 corticosteroid-dependent <b>asthmatics,</b> we examined sputum eosinophil markers on two occasions and correlated them with the control of asthma.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Asthmatics</b> {{are known}} to have esophageal hypomotility. Vagal hypofunction and {{prolonged}} intra-esophageal acidification cause esophageal hypomotility. The contribution of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and vagal function to esophageal motility in <b>asthmatics</b> is unclear. We studied the relationship between esophageal motility, GER and vagal function in a cohort of adult <b>asthmatics.</b> Methods Thirty mild, stable <b>asthmatics</b> (ATS criteria) and 30 healthy volunteers underwent 24 -hour ambulatory esophageal monitoring, manometry, autonomic function testing and GER symptom assessment. 27 <b>asthmatics</b> underwent gastroscopy. A vagal function score calculated from 3 tests (valsalva maneuver, heart rate response to deep breathing and to standing from supine position) was correlated with esophageal function parameters. Results <b>Asthmatics</b> (mean age 34. 8 (SD 8. 4), 60 % female) had more frequent GERD symptoms than controls (mean age 30. 9 (SD 7. 7), 50 % female). 10 / 27 <b>asthmatics</b> had esophageal mucosal damage, 22 showed hypervagal response, none had a hyperadrenergic response. 14 <b>asthmatics</b> had ineffective esophageal motility.

Different phenotypes of asthma have been recently highlighted and are probably underlied by different immunological profiles.

5|$|Along {{with other}} members of the lipocalin protein family, major urinary {{proteins}} can be potent allergens to humans. The reason for this is not known, however molecular mimicry between Mups and structurally similar human lipocalins has been proposed as a possible explanation. The protein product of the mouse Mup17 gene, known as Musm1, Ag1 or MA1, accounts for much of the allergenic properties of mouse urine. The protein is extremely stable in the environment; studies have found 95% of inner city homes, and 82% of all types of homes in the United States have detectable levels in at least one room. Similarly, Ratn1 is a known human allergen. A US study found its presence in 33% of inner city homes, and 21% of occupants were sensitized to the allergen.

We hypothesized that increased smooth muscle bundles in the airway walls would disrupt airway lymphatics to impair airway clearance in these fatal <b>asthmatics.</b> MethodsThe autopsy lungs of seven fatal <b>asthmatics</b> (three Type I, four Type II <b>asthmatics)</b> and five controls were examined by immunohistochemistry {{to reveal the}} lymphatics distributed in the airway walls. The total area of lymphatics around each cross-sectioned airway was measured and its airway radius was calculated using an image analyzer system. Finally, the distribution areas of lymphatics in {{the same level of}} airways of bronchial trees were compared among Type I, Type II <b>asthmatics</b> and controls. ResultsThe total area of airway lymphatics in each lung was found to be positively correlated with the airway radius (R). The distribution areas of lymphatics in larger airways (1. 5 < R < 2. 0 mm) of both types of <b>asthmatics</b> were significantly decreased than controls, and Type I <b>asthmatics</b> contained much less lymphatics than Type II <b>asthmatics</b> in these airways. The lymphatics around smaller airways (0. 5 < R < 1. 0 mm) were also reduced in both phenotypes of <b>asthmatics</b> without statistic difference between them. The airway lymphatics of these fatal <b>asthmatics</b> were observed to be interrupted by thickened muscle bundle layers, and by fibrotic tissues developed around these airways as well. ConclusionsThese results indicate that distribution of lymphatics were decreased in the airway walls of fatal <b>asthmatics</b> which contained muscle bundles and fibro-connective tissues both of which were augmented in these airway walls to disrupt lymphatics, impair airway clearance and accelerate mucosal edema which would cause refractory status of these patients...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{significant}} number of older <b>asthmatics,</b> more often than in previous ages, have poorly controlled asthma, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. On the other hand, cur-rent guidelines suggest that most <b>asthmatics</b> can obtain achievement and maintenance of disease control and do not include sections specific to the management of asthma in the elderly {{so that it is}} more evident the contrast between poor control of asthma in the elderly and the lack of specific guidance from guidelines on asthma management in older <b>asthmatics.</b> Inhaled corticosteroids are the cornerstone for older <b>asthmatics,</b> eventually with add-on inhaled long-acting beta-agonists; inhaled short acting beta-agonists can be used as rescue medications. Triggers exacerbating asthma are similar for all ages, but inhaled viruses and drug interactions have greater clinical significance in the elderly. Older <b>asthmatics</b> have an increased likelihood of comorbidities and polypharmacy, with possible worsening of asthma control and reduced treatment adherence. Physicians and older <b>asthmatics</b> probably either do not perceive or accept a poor asthma control.

40|$|It {{is known}} that IFN-γ, T-cell lymphokine, has potent effects on {{immunoglobulin}} synthesis, leukotrienes synthesis and delayed-type hypersensitivity.

The results were as follows : (1) There was a significant correlation between IFN-γ production and Candida specific serum IgG 1 antibody.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although mild to {{moderate}} asthma {{is known to be}} Th 2 driven, cytokines produced in refractory asthma might not fit the classical Th 2 pattern. METHODS: The aim of our study was to assess the cytokine production by sputum and blood cells from 15 refractory <b>asthmatics</b> (American Thoracic Society Criteria) compared to 15 mild untreated and 17 moderate treated <b>asthmatics</b> and 22 healthy subjects. Spontaneous production of interleukin (IL) - 4, IL- 6, IL- 10, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor alpha was measured by immunotrapping after 24 h sputum or blood cell culture. RESULTS: Moderate and refractory <b>asthmatics</b> were both characterized by a lower production of IL- 6 from their airway cells compared to healthy subjects. However, the difference was no longer significant when expressing the results per gram of sputum. No significant difference between the three groups was found regarding other cytokines. As for cytokine production from blood, the three groups of <b>asthmatics</b> exhibited raised production of IL- 4 when compared to healthy subjects, and this was true when results were expressed per blood volume or after normalization for total leukocyte cell count.
