30|$|ITS {{has been}} studied for long time but a {{fundamental}} solution has not been found {{due to lack of}} systematic <b>accident</b> management system in prevention and management of <b>accident</b> when a traffic <b>accident</b> takes place. s-ITSF proposed by this paper classifies the event before <b>accident</b> and after <b>accident</b> to provide an <b>accident</b> prevention service before <b>accident</b> and proposes an efficient and systematic SAM framework after <b>accident</b> by classifying the <b>accident</b> in hierarchy. The proposed framework provided a personalize service to identify the level of <b>accident</b> damage information to step through the AMC and AMO provided the personal services support to the <b>accident</b> area. In addition, it may provide the information to prevent an <b>accident</b> through collection and management of the <b>accident</b> information through TADC. s-ITSF is expected to provide an efficient and safe <b>accident</b> management preventing an <b>accident</b> being applied to the current ITS environment, provided that an additional research is needed in order to solve an overhead problem which may occur in big data processing.|$|R

Prior to develop this <b>accident</b> computer package, this study examines the <b>accident</b> situation in Thailand in two parts with two scales. The <b>accident</b> reporting was analyzed with a macro scale, represents <b>accident</b> situation for a whole country, and an intermediate scale, referred to community scale. By reviewing natures of data, tasks, and related issues, the computerized system was developed as a supplementary tool for assess the <b>accident</b> situation in Thailand. The <b>accident</b> under-reporting, <b>accident</b> reported matching, and <b>accident</b> during holiday festivals can be performed to present more precisely about the <b>accident</b> situation in Thailand...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} ability to learn from an {{aircraft}} <b>accident</b> as the opportunities for learning diminish with {{the decline in the}} <b>accident</b> rate. A safety compromising case is studied as the processes of aircraft <b>accident</b> intervention and recovery can degrade the ability of an aircraft <b>accident</b> investigation process to enhance aviation safety by revealing <b>accident</b> causation. In the case study an assessment of the Slovenian aircraft <b>accident</b> response system was made. For the purpose of evaluating the successfulness of aircraft <b>accident</b> intervention and effectiveness of recovery, a model of aircraft <b>accident</b> response system requirements has been developed. Based on non-conformances identified by the model of requirements, remedial measures are proposed for the enhancement of the aircraft <b>accident</b> response system operation. Criteria for the definition of the transition from <b>accident</b> intervention to recovery are derived from the assessment findings in a manner not to impede the aircraft <b>accident</b> investigation effectiveness and efficiency. </p...|$|R

One theoretical analysis model was established in order to prevent the occurrence of overloaded bucket dropping <b>accident.</b> The model provided scientific basis and steps in theory for qualitative and quantitative analysis on the cause of falling bucket <b>accident</b> and for the study on <b>accident</b> prediction and prevention. This article proposed several feasible technical measures to prevent the bucket crash <b>accident,</b> which had important guiding significance in practical application. ...|$|R

Notably, motor vehicle <b>accidents</b> occur more frequently in the early afternoon, when drivers presumably have recently finished lunch. A study of motor <b>accidents</b> in Sweden between 1987 and 1991 found that the time around 5 pm had by far the most accidents: around 1,600 at 5 pm compared to around 1,000 each at 4 pm and 6 pm. This trend may have been influenced by the afternoon rush hour, but the morning rush hour showed a much smaller increase. In Finland, <b>accidents</b> in the agriculture industry are most common in the afternoon, specifically Monday afternoons in September.|$|E

30|$|AMC classifies {{the status}} of the <b>accident</b> through the user’s health {{information}} and status information vehicle collected in order to classify the exact <b>accident</b> status when an <b>accident</b> occurs. vehicle damage level (VDL) VDL- 0 provides a service which checks the normal status vehicle of such as driver’s condition, lane keeping, and prevention of collision, fuel status and batter/tire status. VDL- 1 provides a service which checks a minor <b>accident</b> of the vehicle such as driver’s health condition and vehicle status and authenticates the trueness of the <b>accident</b> through black box service. It also informs the <b>accident</b> to insurance company for quick settlement. VDL- 2 and 3 provides a service which checks general <b>accident</b> status and large <b>accident</b> status such as alarm service of airbag and secondary <b>accident</b> warning to inform the <b>accident</b> status to the family of the user. In addition, it provides an efficient service through the ambulance and police car service for safety of the driver. Through the <b>accident</b> management service classified by hierarchy, it may provide a quick and safe service minimizing unnecessary manpower and waste of resources when an <b>accident</b> takes place. Further, it delivers the <b>accident</b> status and position information to TADC based on the information of user’s health and vehicle’s status collected.|$|R
