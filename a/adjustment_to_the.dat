5|$|Despite {{manufacturing}} developments The Churchill Machine Tool Co {{experienced a}} lean period from 1921 to 1934, {{being unable to}} distribute a dividend on its ordinary share capital. The commencement of European rearmament from 1935 is given {{as the cause of}} a dramatic turnaround in fortunes. A dividend of 12% was paid in that year; in the following year it was quadrupled and there was a special dividend of 125%. An <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> share capital was made, and in 1938 the dividend was 40%, with an additional scrip bonus of 33.3%. There was a subsequent fall in the yield to 30%, but in cash terms, allowing for capital restructuring, the payment remained the same.|$|E
5|$|During the 2009 session, Roberts {{sponsored}} several bills {{relating to}} juvenile criminal offenders, including legislation {{to allow more}} juveniles to have their criminal records expunged, and to allow young adults to serve sentences within the Youth Offender System instead of correctional facilities. Roberts also sponsored legislation to make minor <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> statutes concerning the Colorado Youth Advisory Council, legislation to create a regional self-insurance plan within the San Luis Valley, and legislation revising statutes surrounding end-of-life care.|$|E
5|$|Four {{significant}} changes to Highway3 {{have taken place}} since the designation of the route in 1920. The first was an <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eastern terminus. The second was the Essex Bypass, built through the 1970s between Windsor and Leamington. The third was the St. Thomas Expressway, a super two highway built in the late 1970s. The final change was the provincial highway transfers conducted in 1997 and 1998 that resulted in three segments of Highway3 being decommissioned: between Leamington and Talbotville Royale, through Port Colborne and within Fort Erie.|$|E

5|$|Each planet or moon has a mass, and {{therefore}} a gravitational pull, though they do not affect one another and only the single strongest pull affects the player's ship. This sometimes results in odd behavior; for example, the gravitational effect of Mars is much stronger than that of its moon Phobos. This means that a player attempting to land on Phobos needs to allow the ship to fall below the moon's surface until it is close enough to Phobos's center that Phobos's pull becomes the dominant force, {{at which point the}} ship snaps back to be landed on the surface. The name of the planet or moon with the current strongest pull is displayed on the screen. Players are able to edit the program to change the conditions; popular variations by the original players were increasing the gravity level and thus the difficulty, or an <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> coordinate display system so that, rather than the ship staying {{in the center of the}} screen and the planets moving relative to it, the current dominant planet would always be at the bottom of the screen, with the ship moving relative to it.|$|E
5|$|Rega {{went against}} {{conventional}} {{wisdom of the}} time, preferring to make their decks lightweight and rigid {{as a means of}} controlling unwanted resonances. Their belief was that mass absorbs energy and results in lost music. In other senses, the turntables are deliberately minimalistic and neither require nor justify any 'tweaking' by users, except <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vertical-tracking-angle (VTA) of the cartridge. It is a belt-driven design incorporating a driving 'sub-platter' mounted on a high quality oil-lubricated bearing, which is fixed directly to a medite (MDF) plinth supported by three simple rubber feet. A heavy glass platter sits atop the sub-platter, which is driven by a mechanically-isolated 24V synchronous motor through a rubber belt. A 2mm-thick mat sits on top of the glass platter. The turntable is without suspension, and the rubber feet provide limited mechanical isolation from floor-transmitted vibrations. A perspex cover is provided for some isolation against airborne vibrations. The record deck is single speed – it runs at 33 rpm, and the user must physically remove the platter to reposition the drive belt to play 45 rpm records.|$|E
5|$|Steve DeBerg {{opened the}} second half with an 84-yard drive ending in a touchdown, and {{followed}} that with a touchdown pass to Gerald Carter a minute later. The game nearly became {{a repeat of the}} previous week, as the Packers replaced quarterback Don Majkowski with Randy Wright. Wright's two fourth-quarter touchdowns cut into Tampa Bay's 23–3 lead, but this time the offense was able {{to hold on to the}} ball. Two Calvin Magee catches for first downs sealed the victory. The Buccaneers' 17second-half points are credited to the coaching staff's <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Packers' man-to-man defense. The Buccaneers and Packers both had the same amount of net yards (279), passing yards (190), and rushing yards (89). Donald Igwebuike's three field goals broke Bill Capece's Buccaneer career record. The victory left the Buccaneers in second place in the NFC Central division. This led to speculation as to whether coach Perkins, who had been able to lead the New York Giants to the playoffs in three years as their coach, would be able to repeat the feat in a single year with Tampa Bay.|$|E

25|$|A second method called 'continuous blending' is now gaining favor. Oxygen, helium and air are blended on {{the intake}} {{side of a}} compressor. The oxygen and helium are fed into the air stream using flow meters, so as to achieve the rough mix. The low {{pressure}} mixture is analyzed for oxygen content and the oxygen and helium flows adjusted accordingly. On the high pressure side of the compressor a regulator is used to reduce pressure of a sample flow and the trimix is analyzed (preferably for both helium and oxygen) so that the fine <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> intake gas flows can be made.|$|E
25|$|Squid jiggers – have {{single or}} double drum jigger winches lined along the rails around the vessel. Strong lamps, up to 5000 W each, {{are used to}} attract the squid. These are {{arranged}} 50–60 centimetres apart, either as one row in {{the centre of the}} vessel, or two rows, one on each side. As the squid are caught they are transferred by chutes to the processing plant of the vessel. The jigging motion can be produced mechanically by the shape of the drum or electronically by <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> winch motor. Squid jiggers are often used during the day as midwater trawlers and during the night as jiggers.|$|E

25|$|On 1 December 1918 the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs {{merged with}} Serbia, {{becoming}} part of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes; in 1929 it was renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The main territory of Slovenia, being the most industrialized and westernized compared to other less developed parts of Yugoslavia, became the main center of industrial production: Compared to Serbia, for example, Slovenian industrial production was four times greater; and it was 22 times greater than in Macedonia. The interwar period brought further industrialization in Slovenia, with rapid economic growth in the 1920s, followed by a relatively successful economic <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1929 economic crisis and Great Depression.|$|E
25|$|The GPALS system {{provided}} a major <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States’ military strategy in several ways. First, it shifted the United States away from fighting an all-out {{war with the}} Soviet Union. Instead, the GPALS system prompted the United States military to begin fighting smaller battles with various opponents all around the globe. These other opponents included nations who might have acquired nuclear weapons or broken-up sections of the Soviet Union. Second, the GPALS system focused more heavily on protecting the United States from limited nuclear attacks that involved smaller numbers of warheads. Third, and finally, this system was introduced to protect not just the United States, but also its military forces {{around the world and}} its allies.|$|E
25|$|Bolivia, {{like much}} of Latin America, is a highly class-segregated society, in this case along ethnic lines: European-Indio. European {{descendants}} tend to monopolize political and economic power {{and in fact the}} republican institutions are drawn along the lines of European schools of thought with little or no <b>adjustment</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> indigenous tradition. This makes it much harder for the indigenous to integrate into society and to achieve personal success. Since the late 1990s, the indigenous communities have become radicalized throughout the Andes, pressing for political reform in Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia, loosely coordinated in the Pachacuti movement. The Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) is perhaps the strongest political expression of this movement in Bolivia, coordinating a wide range of community-based organizations mostly reflecting Aymara political aspirations.|$|E
