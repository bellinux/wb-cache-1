50|$|There {{are risks}} {{associated}} with never-done-before technologies like the construction and operation of <b>a</b> space <b>elevator.</b> <b>A</b> space <b>elevator</b> would present <b>a</b> navigational hazard, both to aircraft and spacecraft. Aircraft could {{be dealt with by}} means of simple air-traffic control restrictions. Impacts by space objects such as meteoroids and micrometeorites pose a more difficult problem for construction and operation of <b>a</b> space <b>elevator.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> space <b>elevator</b> {{does not}} need to be powered as a {{rotovator}} does, because it gets any required angular momentum from the planetary body. The disadvantage is that it is much longer, and for many planets <b>a</b> space <b>elevator</b> cannot be constructed from known materials. <b>A</b> space <b>elevator</b> on Earth would require material strengths outside current technological limits (2014). Martian and lunar space elevators could be built with modern-day materials however. <b>A</b> space <b>elevator</b> on Phobos has also been proposed.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> {{demolished}} 1950 <b>elevator</b> {{built by}} X. C. Hadford Company was licensed as <b>a</b> [...] seed <b>elevator</b> in 1952. In 1992, it was licensed as <b>a</b> 240-tonne primary <b>elevator.</b>|$|R
5|$|Both {{platforms}} have concrete windscreens {{on either}} end and steel canopies at the portions underneath the center station building. The platforms are offset, with the southbound platform extending {{slightly to the}} north, and the northbound platform extending slightly further south. <b>An</b> <b>elevator</b> {{and a set of}} staircases and escalators from each subway platform go up to the shared fare control.|$|E
5|$|Despite massive {{flooding}} and damage to entire neighborhoods, {{there were no}} drowning deaths in flooded homes. In the area, there were 12deaths from driving, 6 from walking, 3 from electrocution, and 1 in <b>an</b> <b>elevator.</b> Elsewhere in Texas, a man drowned when swimming in a ditch in Mauriceville. Damage totaled to $5.2billion (2001USD, $6billion 2007USD) throughout Texas.|$|E
5|$|Jennifer {{enters a}} room, where she discovers Dan Barrows. Dan awakens and chases Jennifer to a steep cliff. She {{successfully}} climbs over, knocking down {{a can of}} kerosene which splashes onto a nearby candle. This triggers an explosion that immolates Dan, while Jennifer rides <b>an</b> <b>elevator</b> out of the catacombs. She ends up defeating Bobby and Mary in the clock tower.|$|E

5|$|A {{transfer}} will {{be constructed}} {{at the eastern}} end of the 125th Street station to connect to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line's 125th Street station. A new lower-level mezzanine will house the connection between the two stations, directly connecting to the downtown platform for Lexington Avenue service. The direct connection to the staircases to the upper level will be rebuilt. At the western end of the station, a transfer will be built to connect to the Harlem–125th Street station of the Metro-North Railroad. <b>An</b> <b>elevator,</b> stairs, and escalators would connect the two stations.|$|E
5|$|Altgens photographed President Kennedy for the AP in 1961 at Perrin Air Force Base. Kennedy and his {{predecessor}} Dwight D. Eisenhower were traveling to Bonham, Texas, in November {{to attend the}} funeral of Sam Rayburn, three-time Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. Earlier that day, Altgens was the only photojournalist to climb to the 29th floor of the Mercantile National Bank Building in Dallas to cover the rescue {{of a young girl}} from <b>an</b> <b>elevator</b> fire.|$|E

50|$|Watson was platted in 1879 {{when the}} {{railroad}} {{was extended to}} that point. The city took {{its name from the}} Watson Farmers <b>Elevator,</b> <b>a</b> local grain <b>elevator.</b> <b>A</b> post office has been in operation in Watson since 1879.|$|R
5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) later {{encounters}} {{the stranger}} {{as she walks}} into <b>an</b> <b>elevator.</b> Both ride in silence up to the fourth floor, with Scully somewhat unsettled by the experience. At Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) apartment, Mulder and Scully begin discussing a case the pair are working on, wherein {{the heart of the}} victim had been removed with the absence of any significant physical evidence. Mulder believes the heart was removed with a technique known as psychic surgery. Meanwhile, Padgett, who is Mulder's neighbor, stands on a chair with his ear to an air vent, listening to the conversation.|$|E
5|$|In 1904 Adler had the Grand Theater {{built in}} {{what was to be}} the Yiddish Theater District at the corner of Bowery and Canal Street, the first {{purpose-built}} Yiddish theater in New York. His wife Sara had branched out to do her own plays at the Novelty Theater in Brooklyn, and the family had taken up residence in a four-story brownstone, with <b>an</b> <b>elevator,</b> in the East Seventies. (They would later move one more time, to Riverside Drive.) Around this time Lincoln Steffens wrote a piece saying that Yiddish theater in New York had eclipsed English-language theater in quality.|$|E
5|$|In 2028, Sigma is {{abducted}} {{and placed}} inside <b>an</b> <b>elevator</b> with Phi. Zero III appears on a monitor and informs {{them that they}} are participants in the Nonary Game and that they must escape the elevator before it falls. Upon escaping, they find themselves in a warehouse-like facility with Dio, Quark, Tenmyouji, Luna, Alice, K, and Clover. Zero III informs the group that nine individual bracelet points are necessary to escape the facility, and points can only be earned by participating in the Ambidex Game.|$|E

50|$|The fire also {{destroyed}} <b>a</b> grain <b>elevator</b> {{which had}} been built by Hull & Old around 1867 as a steam-powered grist mill. <b>A</b> new <b>elevator</b> was built, which {{burned to the ground}} in September 1996, never to be rebuilt.|$|R
5|$|Joseph Meegar (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), a shy {{delivery}} boy {{who lives}} with his mother (Marylouise Burke), arrives late for work and delivers a package to an office building where he comes across Bethany (Diane Davis), a receptionist with whom he's infatuated. Afterward, while in <b>an</b> <b>elevator,</b> Bethany notices Meegar has pictures of her on his cell phone. Meegar's angst then apparently causes the elevator to fall to the underground parking lot levels, killing all but Meegar. He is able to walk away unharmed, but is then startled as all the car alarms go off around him.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the rocks}} and {{minerals}} are housed in glass cases along the walls in the basement. Before opening to the public <b>an</b> <b>elevator</b> {{was added to the}} home. The museum includes a lapidary and arts gallery, agate gallery, petrified wood gallery, oddities gallery, crystal gallery, Northwest gallery, and fossil gallery. There is also an educational room and gift shop, while the outside grounds include a walk that features sandstone, columns of basalt, and a pile of rocks for children to climb over to find stones.

5|$|SimTower {{allows the}} player {{to build and}} manage the {{operations}} of a modern, multi-use skyscraper. They must plan where to place facilities in the tower that include restaurants, condominiums, offices, hotel rooms, retail stores and elevators. To prevent tenants from vacating their properties, the player must keep their stress low by fulfilling their demands for medical centers, parking lots, recycling facilities, clean hotel rooms {{with the help of}} housekeepers, and an efficient transportation system, which involves managing elevator traffic. SimTower, which was built around <b>an</b> <b>elevator</b> simulation program, places a strong emphasis on good elevator management.|$|E
5|$|The Boston-Albany {{section of}} Amtrak's Lake Shore Limited serves Pittsfield with one train in each {{direction}} daily. Both trains are scheduled to arrive mid-afternoon. The Amtrak platform, which is located below the main level of the building, is accessible using a stairway or <b>an</b> <b>elevator.</b> There is a single low-level platform facing one of the line's two tracks. A wheelchair lift is available for use if needed, making the station fully handicapped accessible.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s, Jerome Pearson {{independently}} {{conceived the}} idea of <b>a</b> space <b>elevator,</b> {{sometimes referred to as}} a synchronous tether, and, in particular, analyzed <b>a</b> lunar <b>elevator</b> that can go through the L1 and L2 points, and this was found to be possible with materials then existing.|$|R
