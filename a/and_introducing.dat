5|$|They {{decided to}} focus on a few aspects and assess the value of other features. This approach, they hope, helps to {{maintain}} the quality of their games. The company focused on the development of role-playing games, with the team working on established franchises with a fan base <b>and</b> <b>introducing</b> lesser-known franchises to a wide audience. When the team develops an open-world game, they prioritise quest design over the size of its world in the belief that having choices to make encourages players to immerse themselves in the game.|$|E
5|$|A three-part series {{published}} between November 1993 and January 1994, {{the series}} introduces attorney Beck as a love interest for Brock. When Beck pursues {{a lawsuit against}} Scarmore Industries for employees poisoned by a sentient liquid-mercury virus, Venom is injured trying {{to protect her from}} the Juggernaut's kidnap attempt. The symbiote is submerged and infected with the sentient virus (which heals Brock), bonding with the pair <b>and</b> <b>introducing</b> a third mind into their relationship. The virus drives Brock insane (causing him to murder a cleaning lady), and he is physically transported to the realm of insanity to confront its avatars: Paranoia, Dusk and the Necromancer. The symbiote overcomes the virus; Brock regains his senses, and Venom is returned to earth. Beck later insists on only being Brock's friend, because his romantic feelings for her make him more violent. Among DCD's 300 bestselling issues of 1993 Venom: The Madness #1 was number 173; the remaining issues did not chart.|$|E
5|$|By now the Ordainers {{had drawn}} up their Ordinances for reform and Edward had little {{political}} {{choice but to}} give way and accept them in October.

In addition, the Ordinances exiled Gaveston once again, this time with instructions that he {{should not be allowed to}} live anywhere within Edward's lands, including Gascony and Ireland, and that he should be stripped of his titles. Edward retreated to his estates at Windsor and Kings Langley; Gaveston left England, possibly for northern France or Flanders.|$|E

5|$|Demosthenes {{relied heavily}} on the {{difference}} aspects of ethos, especially phronesis. When presenting himself to the Assembly, he had to depict himself as a credible and wise statesman and adviser {{in order to be}} persuasive. One tactic that Demosthenes used during his philippics was foresight. He pleaded with his audience to predict the potential of being defeated, and to prepare. He appealed to pathos through patriotism <b>and</b> <b>introducing</b> the atrocities that would befall Athens if it was taken over by Philip. He was a master at “self-fashioning” by referring to his previous accomplishments, and renewing his credibility. He would also slyly undermine his audience by claiming that they had been wrong to not listen before, however they could redeem themselves if they listened and acted with him presently.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{claiming}} the premiership in 1945, Eastern Suburbs {{failed to make}} the finals for the following seven seasons. A runners-up finish in 1960 was the closest the club came to {{claiming the}} premiership during this era. Eastern Suburbs were soundly defeated 31–6 in the grand final that year, by the famous record-beating St George outfit. In 1966, the club fell to new depths and was winless {{for the first time in}} its history. It was also the last occasion in which the Roosters won the wooden spoon until claiming it again in the 2009 season. It ended a poor run for Eastern Suburbs; from 1963 to 1966, they won 8 of 72 matches, finishing second to last in 1964 and last in the other three years. The club underwent a renaissance in 1967 after appointing Jack Gibson as coach (1967–68), <b>and</b> <b>introducing</b> a new emblem on the playing jerseys, the rooster.|$|E
5|$|During {{the presidential}} {{referendum}} in Egypt, Nasser was re-elected {{to a second}} term as UAR president and took his oath on 25 March 1965. He was the only candidate for the position, with virtually all of his political opponents forbidden by law from running for office, and his fellow party members reduced to mere followers. That same year, Nasser had the Muslim Brotherhood chief ideologue Sayyed Qutb imprisoned. Qutb was charged and found guilty by the court of plotting to assassinate Nasser, and was executed in 1966. Beginning in 1966, as Egypt's economy slowed and government debt became increasingly burdensome, Nasser began to ease state control over the private sector, encouraging state-owned bank loans to private business <b>and</b> <b>introducing</b> incentives to increase exports. During the 60's, the Egyptian economy went from sluggishness to the verge of collapse, the society became less free, and Nasser's appeal waned considerably.|$|E

5|$|In September, Randy Orton, who at {{the time}} was injured, made an {{appearance}} on Raw, where he criticized all the champions, mocking Rhodes and DiBiase for allowing their title belts to be stolen by Cryme Tyme (Shad Gaspard and JTG). The two responded by assaulting Cryme Tyme <b>and</b> <b>introducing</b> Manu (son of Afa the Wild Samoan) as their new member at Unforgiven. This did little to impress Orton, so later that evening Rhodes, DiBiase, and Manu assaulted World Heavyweight Champion CM Punk as Orton confronted him backstage. This allowed Orton to punt Punk in the head, removing him from his championship match, and gaining Orton's respect.|$|E
