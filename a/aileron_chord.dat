50|$|The Mg-9 was a glider {{designed}} as a high performance and training aircraft with aerobatic capabilities. Like most gliders of its day, it was wood framed {{with a mixture of}} plywood and fabric covering. It had a high gull wing built around a single spar, with ply covering ahead of it around the leading edge forming a torsion resistant D-box. The centre section was rectangular in plan, with ply covering extending rearwards to a diagonal drag strut. This inner section had modest dihedral, about 3°. Behind main and drag struts the wing was fabric covered. Outboard the straight leading edge had slight sweep on it, and the trailing edge curved in to elliptical tips. One of the changes made between the prototype Mg 9 and the production Mg 9a was a reduction of <b>aileron</b> <b>chord,</b> though on both versions these extended over the whole of the tapered our panels. The wing was supported over the fuselage by a ply covered pylon which contained the rear cockpit. The prototype had a single, faired lift strut between the spar and the lower fuselage but production aircraft replaced this with an unusual inverted V pair of thin struts on each side, partly to ease the introduction of a monowheel between its fuselage connections.|$|E

40|$|A flight {{investigation}} {{was made of}} the increase in effectiveness of ailerons that can be obtained by preventing flow of air through the wing at the hinges and of the possibility of reducing the aileron operating force by replacing ailerons having normal open hinge gaps with narrower but equally effective ailerons having sealed hinge gaps. Tests were made with a Fairchild 22 airplane with two sizes of plain unbalanced ailerons, one set having a chord equal to 0. 18 c, and the other chord equal to 0. 09 c. The results of the investigation show that improvement of the lateral-control effectiveness is obtained by completely preventing the flow of air through the wing at the hinge axis of conventional ailerons. The magnitude of the improvement depends on the <b>aileron</b> <b>chord.</b> For the 0. 18 c ailerons the gain in aileron effectiveness due to sealing the gap at the hinge axis was of the order of one-fifth and for the 0. 09 c ailerons the gain was about one-third. The importance of sealing the gap was demonstrated {{by the fact that the}} 0. 09 c ailerons with a slight increase in deflection range were made as effective as the 0. 18 c ailerons with an unsealed gap but required only about one-third as large an operating force...|$|E

2500|$|The most {{immediately}} obvious {{difference between}} the two designs was that the Fafnir 2 was a mid-wing aircraft. [...] The original Fafnir had a high wing and initially suffered serious aerodynamic drag losses at the wing-fuselage junctions. [...] Wind tunnel studies at the University of Göttingen showed that these losses were lower with mid-wing designs. They also suggested that the wing and fuselage be integrated and the latter be cambered to provide some lift. [...] The strongly tapered wing was ply covered ahead of the single spar, forming a torsion resisting D-box, and fabric covered aft over most of the span, though the surface near the fuselage was wholly ply covered. The wing section, designed by Lippisch himself, was much thinner and less cambered than on the Fafnir, with less low speed lift but also less high speed drag, reflecting the increasing understanding that cross country gliding required speed between thermals as well as the ability to climb within them. As on the original Fafnir, only the inner 40% of the span had dihedral. Tapered <b>ailerons,</b> their <b>chord</b> increasing outwards, occupied all the trailing edge of the outer panels.|$|R
5000|$|Building on lessons learned, Lockheed Martin {{modified}} {{a commercial}} {{variant of the}} C-130 into a High Technology Test Bed (HTTB). This test aircraft set numerous short takeoff and landing performance records and significantly expanded the database for future derivatives of the C-130. [...] Modifications made to the HTTB included extended <b>chord</b> <b>ailerons,</b> a long <b>chord</b> rudder, fast-acting double-slotted trailing edge flaps, a high-camber wing leading edge extension, a larger dorsal fin and dorsal fins, the addition of three spoiler panels to each wing upper surface, a long-stroke main and nose landing gear system, and changes to the flight controls and a change from direct mechanical linkages assisted by hydraulic boost, to fully powered controls, in which the mechanical linkages from the flight station controls operated only the hydraulic control valves of the appropriate boost unit. The HTTB first flew on 19 June 1984, with civil registration of N130X. After demonstrating many new technologies, {{some of which were}} applied to the C-130J, the HTTB was lost in a fatal accident on 3 February 1993, at Dobbins Air Reserve Base, in Marietta, Georgia. [...] The crash was attributed to disengagement of the rudder fly-by-wire flight control system, resulting in a total loss of rudder control capability while conducting ground minimum control speed tests (Vmcg). The disengagement was a result of the inadequate design of the rudder's integrated actuator package by its manufacturer; the operator's insufficient system safety review failed to consider the consequences of the inadequate design to all operating regimes. A factor which contributed to the accident was the flight crew's lack of engineering flight test training.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from its}} engine installation, the Prawn was a {{conventional}} small flying boat, using {{a good deal}} of stainless steel in its construction.

The wing was supported over the fuselage with steel inverted V cabane struts. There was a generous cut-out in the trailing edge centre section to improve the view from the single open cockpit. Outboard, there were broad <b>chord</b> <b>ailerons</b> and below the wings a pair of stabilising floats mounted on N type struts and braced inboard by another parallel pair.|$|R
