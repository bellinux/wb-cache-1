5|$|During the Internet bubble {{that led}} up to 2000, heavy {{investments}} in undersea fibre-optic cables linked Asia {{with the rest of the}} world. The fall that followed the economic boom resulted in the auction of cheap fiber optic cables at one-tenth of their original price. This development resulted in widely available low-cost communications infrastructure. All of these investments and events, not to mention a swell of available talent, resulted in India becoming almost overnight the centre for outsourcing of Business process. Within this sector and events, the ITES-BPO sector has become a big employment generator especially <b>amongst</b> <b>young</b> college graduates.

25|$|The Soviet Army's officer-to-soldier {{ratio was}} {{extremely}} top-heavy, partially {{in order to}} compensate for the relatively low education level of the military manpower base and the absence of professional NCOs. Following WorldWarII and the great expansion of officer education, officers became the product of four-to-five-year higher military colleges. As in most armies, newly commissioned officers usually become platoon leaders, having to accept responsibility for the soldiers' welfare and training (with the exceptions noted above). Young officers in Soviet Army units were worked round the clock, normally receiving only three days off per month. Annual vacations were under threat if deficiencies emerged within the unit, and the pressure created enormous stress. Towards the end of the Soviet Union, this led to a decline in morale <b>amongst</b> <b>young</b> officers.|$|E

During the journey between stations, participants are usually required to stand in the train and not hold onto any supports, known as Subsurfing. A subcrawl usually takes a whole day, and completing a crawl (drinking in the same pub one started in) is regarded as quite an achievement.|$|E
25|$|Bowling {{actions are}} {{typically}} divided into side on and front on actions. In the side on action, the back foot lands {{parallel to the}} bowling crease and the bowler aims at the wicket by looking over his front shoulder. In the front on action, the back foot lands pointing down the pitch and the bowler aims at the wicket by looking inside the line of his front arm. Many bowlers operate with a mid-way action with the back foot landing at roughly 45 degrees and the upper body aligned somewhere between side on and front on. This {{is not to be}} confused with a mixed action, which mixes distinct elements of both side on and front on actions, and is generally discouraged <b>amongst</b> <b>young</b> bowlers as it can lead to problems in later life due to the twisting of the back inherent in the action.|$|E

He then collaborated with Mani Ratnam {{for the second time}} by appearing in the director's production venture, the romantic comedy Dumm Dumm Dumm (2001), alongside Jyothika. Appearing as an unhappy groom trying to halt his wedding, the film won positive acclaim and became a commercial success, with Madhavan establishing himself as a bankable actor in South India. Madhavan then again appeared as a husband in a tumultuous marriage in Parthale Paravasam (2001), the hundredth venture of veteran director K. Balachander. Despite featuring amongst an ensemble cast and being highly anticipated prior to release, the film failed at the box-office, with critics citing that Madhavan looked [...] "rather bored" [...] with the proceedings. Similarly his first lead role in a Hindi film, Rehna Hai Tere Dil Mein (2001), a remake of his Minnale, was also unsuccessful at the box office, with the film and Madhavan's performance receiving mixed reviews. However, the film belatedly gained popularity through screenings on television and subsequently developed a cult following <b>amongst</b> <b>young</b> audiences.|$|E
