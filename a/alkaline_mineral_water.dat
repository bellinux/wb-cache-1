The bicarbonated waters were rich in sodium and bicarbonate and bicarbonated <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> 1 contained 5. 7 times more fluoride than bicarbonated <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> 2. Fasting blood samples and postprandial blood samples were taken at 30, 60, 120, 240, 360 and 420 min {{after the end of}} the meal consumption.

A significant water consumption effect was observed in the total area under the curve (TAUC) of serum and chylomicron triacylglycerols (ANOVA, P= 0. 008 and P= 0. 027, respectively). TAUC of serum triacylglycerols for bicarbonated <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> 2 was significantly lower compared to low <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> (Bonferroni, P= 0. 039).

We {{compared the}} effect of an <b>alkaline</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>water,</b> rich in bicarbonate, with that of an acid one, rich in calcium only, on bone markers, in young women with a normal calcium intake. METHODS: This study compared water A (per litre: 520 mg Ca, 291 mg HCO(3) (-), 1160 mg SO(4) (-), Potential Renal Acid load (PRAL) + 9. 2 mEq) with water B (per litre: 547 mg Ca, 2172 mg HCO(3) (-), 9 mg SO(4) (-), PRAL - 11. 2 mEq). 30 female dieticians aged 26. 3 yrs (SD 7. 3) were randomized into two groups, followed an identical weighed, balanced diet (965 mg Ca) and drank 1. 5 l/d of the assigned water. Changes in blood and urine electrolytes, C-telopeptides (CTX), urinary pH and bicarbonate, and serum PTH were measured after 2 and 4 weeks. RESULTS: The two groups were not different at baseline, and showed a similar increase in urinary calcium excretion. Urinary pH and bicarbonate excretion increased with water B, but not with water A.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{number of}} health {{benefits}} including improvements in acid/base balance, bone metabolism, and cardiovascular risk {{factors have been}} attributed to the intake of magnesium rich <b>alkaline</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>water.</b> This study was designed to investigate the effects of the regular consumption of magnesium bicarbonate supplemented spring water on pH, biochemical parameters of bone metabolism, lipid profile and blood pressure in postmenopausal women. Findings In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, study, 67 postmenopausal women were randomised to receive between 1500 mL and 1800 mL daily of magnesium bicarbonate supplemented spring water (650 mg/L bicarbonate, 120 mg/L magnesium, pH 8. 3 - 8. 5) (supplemented water group) or spring water without supplements (control water group) over 84 days. Over this period biomarkers of bone turnover (serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D, osteocalcin, urinary telopeptides and hydroxyproline), serum lipids (total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides), venous and urinary pH were measured together with measurements of standard biochemistry, haematology and urine examinations. Serum magnesium concentrations and urinary pH in subjects consuming the magnesium bicarbonate supplemented water increased significantly at Day 84 compared to subjects consuming the spring water control (magnesium - p = 0. 03; pH - p = 0. 018). The consumption of spring water led to a trend for an increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations while the PTH concentrations remained stable with the intake of the supplemented spring water. However there were no significant effects of magnesium bicarbonate supplementation in changes to biomarkers of bone mineral metabolism (n-telopeptides, hydroxyproline, osteocalcin and 1, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D) or serum lipids or blood pressure in postmenopausal women from Day 0 to Day 84. Conclusions Short term regular ingestion of magnesium bicarbonate supplemented water provides a source of orally available magnesium.

The study was performed on 27 subjects (mean age 62 ± 2. 2 years, range: 28 - 88) with chronic catarrhalis otitis, chronic rhino-sinusitis and pharyngeal inflammation. These patients underwent 12 sessions of humid-hot inhalation, with vapour jet 20 cm from the face, at 38 °C for 10 min, followed by Politzer with sulphur sodium chloride bicarbonate <b>alkaline</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> from “Rosapepe” Spa, in Contursi (Salerno, Italy). Middle ear function and possible social recovery (based on Giaccai and Gardenghi guidelines) of the patients were assessed, at the beginning and end of the spa therapy. Results, at the end of this treatment, showed a significant (p < 0. 05) increase in audiometric curves corresponding to the normal ventilation of the tympanic box (incidence of 24 % before therapy and 33 % thereafter) and a decrease in pathological curves. Moreover, a significant (p < 0. 05) reduction in the percentage of auditory loss was recorded (N = 41; 19. 7 % ± 2. 5 → 13. 9 % ± 1. 9) and improved hearing, at the frequencies required for daily activities: 500 - 1000 and 2000 Hz (31. 1 dB ± 1. 7 → 26. 8 dB ± 1. 5). No adverse effects to the spa therapy were observed during the study. In conclusion, the results of this study are in agreement with data in the literature, demonstrating that associated spa therapy with Politzer and inhalation have a positive impact on the therapeutic strategy of chronic inflammatory processes, responsible for the onset or persistence of rhinogenic deafness, in order to enhance and combine with the already consolidated pharmacological approaches...|$|E
