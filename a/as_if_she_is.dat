5|$|The video {{starts off}} with Timberlake flirting with Johansson on the burlesque-style club. She rejects with a tease {{at first but}} {{eventually}} leaves with {{him to go back}} to his place. In between cuts, they are shown in bed caressing each other. Johansson jumps into a pool outside the house, and floats below the surface <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> drowning. Timberlake runs out and pulls her up; she laughs at Timberlake and kisses him.|$|E

500|$|A remix {{version for}} the song, [...] "Jackie's In Love In The Club Mix", done by DJ Jackie Christie, was made {{available}} {{as one of}} the exclusive tracks of the American and European maxi-single release of the song. She maintained Madonna's vocals and the gospel choir appearance, commenting that [...] "I was asked to remix 'Nothing Fails' [...] I wanted it to be a mainfloor mix with a big choir breakdown so you felt the magic of the Madonna and the choir, like church." [...] Peter Rauhofer's remix of the song was added along with the remixes of the follow-up single, [...] "Love Profusion". Another version, the [...] "Jason Nevins Mix", was included on Madonna's 2003 remix album Remixed & Revisited. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic commented that on this remix, Madonna sounds <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{out of step with the}} music of 2003.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{you love}} me, don't you?" [...] she murmured {{deep in her}} throat, almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> in a trance, and swaying also <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> swooned in an ecstasy of love.|$|R

500|$|The show {{received}} positive {{reviews and}} critical acclaim. David Segal from The Washington Post {{noted that the}} [...] "difference between this show and the last, the Drowned World Tour of 2001, was striking. That show seems standoffish compared with this one, in part because Madonna has finally worked through whatever issues prevented her from performing her earliest hits. [...] Madonna {{has created a new}} performance hybrid." [...] Segal's view was shared by Elizabeth Smith from The New York Times who also commented that [...] "Unlike 2001's Drowned World Tour, which was dark, often hostile, Re-Invention returns Madonna to the light. She looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> having a good time." [...] Edna Gunderson of USA Today gave the concert four out of four stars and said [...] "Madonna seems to be having a jolly good time. Whereas her last outing had technical strengths but lacked warmth, Reinvention finds Madonna reinvested emotionally. The show doesn't have the degree of flesh, carnal content or shock value that past outings delivered, but this time Madonna is opting for more heart than cleavage and more personality than profanity." [...] Joshua Klein from Chicago Tribune commented that Madonna's show displayed more spectacle than substance.|$|E
500|$|The sixth track, [...] "Criminal Intent" [...] {{features}} Robyn rapping, {{which was}} compared to the rapping style of musician Peaches. The song is about Robyn getting arrested for [...] "freaky dancing" [...] to her own song. Ben Norman of About.com called it [...] "a darker version of [...] previous rap songs". Comparisons were also drawn towards [...] "Fembot" [...] from Body Talk Pt. 1, and [...] "Piece of Me" [...] by Britney Spears. [...] "U Should Know Better" [...] featuring Snoop Dogg was called the album's highlight by several critics. It features Snoop Dogg rapping over an electro beat and Robyn delivering [...] "quotable, ridiculous lines", such as [...] "You know when in Rome I {{sat down with the}} Romans. Said we need a black Pope and she'd better be a woman." [...] Jaime Gill of BBC Music said that the song features [...] "the teen-pop singer and hip hop outlaw swapping louche quips over a relentless, grimy electro stomp." [...] The acoustic [...] "Indestructible" [...] reflects [...] "the downside of needing someone". Norman said that it [...] "is sweeping and symphonic and has so much vulnerability and strength in it that you believe she really will love <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> indestructible." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the later}} Tandy period (1946– 1949) and {{continuing}} throughout the 1950s, Nancy is depicted less {{frequently in the}} center of the action. The Ghost of Blackwood Hall shows an assertive Nancy leading more timid friends up the front steps of the haunted house, and marks a transition to later illustrations. From 1949 forward, she is likely to be observing others, often hiding or concealing herself. Her mouth is often open in surprise, and she hides her body from view. However, although Nancy [...] "expresses surprise, she is not afraid. She appears to be a bit taken aback by what she sees, but she looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> still in control of the situation." [...] Many of these covers feature Nancy poised in the observation of a clue, spying on criminal activity, or displaying her discoveries to others involved in the mystery. Only occasionally is she shown in action, such as running from the scene of a fire, riding a horse, or actively sleuthing with a flashlight. At times she is only involved in action as her hiding place has been discovered by others. In most cases, more active scenes are used for the frontispiece, or in books after 1954, illustrations throughout the text drawn by uncredited illustrators.|$|E

500|$|The {{poster for}} [...] "Turn, Turn, Turn", created by Mike Del Mundo, depicts a maze forming the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo and show title, with a rat inside, hinting ominously at S.H.I.E.L.D.'s {{corruption}} {{and a possible}} traitor. The poster for [...] "Providence", created by Paolo Rivera, highlights the rise of Hydra by showing a melded Hydra and S.H.I.E.L.D. logo, and depicts the team divided by Coulson, Raina, and Ward. The poster for [...] "The Only Light in The Darkness", created by Pascal Campion, focuses on Coulson and his cellist lover, Audrey, while also hinting at the villain for the episode, Marcus Daniels. The poster for [...] "Nothing Personal", created by Stephanie Hans, [...] highlights Skye and Ward in a depiction of a moment from the episode, with Deathlok looming over them, and the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo in the background. The poster for [...] "Ragtag", created by Emma Ríos, depicts significant moments in Ward's life, as well as Fitz–Simmons in danger, and Skye looming behind the S.H.I.E.L.D. logo, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> a presence that Ward cannot seem to shake. The poster for [...] "Beginning of the End", created by Phantom City Creative, {{is reminiscent of the}} first official poster released, with differences including the characters' order and clothing, the poster's coloring, a broken S.H.I.E.L.D. logo over Hydra's, and Ward being tinted by Hydra.|$|E
500|$|She {{heads into}} the interview, bold and honest about her work. [...] She impresses the board and they give her the position. She can't believe it. [...] She heads out to tell Dan Clifford the news, who then tells her that the board have offered that he can move his entire work to Holby and he tell her that the reason he wants to stay is that he loves her. [...] Maddy is overjoyed and they kiss passionately against the bonnet of his car. [...] She heads back to the ward to find {{the father of the}} stab victim missing. She finds him in the basement, {{confused}} and he speaks to Maddy <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> his dead daughter. Maddy tries to help but he keeps referring to Maddy as his daughter. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that everything that happened since Maddy was stabbed was actually a dream and that Maddy actually died in Chantelle's attack. This whole episode was Maddy living out her perfect day in her head. On October 21, 2009, Chantelle was admitted to AAU, pregnant after her boyfriend kicked her in the stomach. Despite telling Maria she didn't kill Maddy, she actually confessed to the murder after Mark told her of the consequences about her lying about her boyfriend abusing her and killing Maddy.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Creep" [...] {{is set in}} {{the time}} {{signature}} of common time with a moderate tempo of 96 beats per minute. It was composed in the traditional verse–chorus form in the key of C minor with Watkins and Thomas' vocals ranging from the chords of C4 to F5. [...] "Yes, it's me again / And, I'm back," [...] Watkins introduces herself while opening the track in a [...] "husky" [...] voice. She then repeats the lines [...] "oh-I, oh-I, oh-I", which was compared by Spin Terry Sutton to Watkins finding [...] "a spiritual instruction in vowel sounds," [...] before going to the first verse of the song. In the first verse, the singer counts her relationship's [...] "twenty-second of loneliness" [...] and expresses how she still loves her boyfriend even acknowledging that he has been cheating on her. Moving on to the song's bridge, she suddenly uses a lower register to [...] "nonchalantly" [...] reveal: [...] "I'll never leave him down, though I might mess around / It's only cause I need some affection." [...] "So I creep / Yeah / And I'll just keep it on the down low," [...] she low-key sings the hook <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> [...] "confessing to a chosen few." [...] Opening up the second verse, Watkins again counting her [...] "twenty-third of loneliness" [...] and still talks about her love for the partner despite signs of a broken romance. After performing the chorus again, her fellow member Thomas joins in to [...] "sweetly" [...] reveal the reason why's she cheating around is because she needs some attention from her lover. Watkins finally ends the track with the lines [...] "I creep around because I need attention / I don't mess around with my affection" [...] while fading out with the heavy beat and the horn sample. Billboard Larry Flick said the two's vocals in the track were [...] "tightly woven" [...] and [...] "rife with raspy grit," [...] which gave a nice contrast to the song's horn sample and funk guitars.|$|E

2500|$|Agriculture is {{approximately}} [...] tall and {{carved out of}} Italian Carrara marble; the sculpture sits on a large cement base. A black label with the word [...] "AGRICULTURE" [...] in large gold letters is affixed to the base. The sculpture is a female form symbolizing agriculture. The figure has classical features, wears {{her hair in a}} bun with two looped braids, and is clothed in robes. Her robes are belted at the waist, as well as draped over her proper left arm. In her proper left arm she also holds wheat. Her proper left foot is extended forward, and her proper right foot is pointed behind her body (<b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{in the middle of a}} step).|$|E
2500|$|Commerce {{measures}} approximately [...] {{tall and}} is {{carved out of}} Italian Carrara marble. [...] It rests on a cement base; attached to the base is a black label that reads [...] "COMMERCE" [...] in large gold letters. The sculpture is a female figure representing commerce. She is dressed in Hellenistic robes which are belted at the waist, and her hair is styled in a bun (with a few tendrils loose on her neck). She holds a caduseus, a classic symbol of commerce, {{in the crook of}} her proper right arm. Her proper right foot is extended slightly forward, while her proper left foot is pointed downward behind her body (<b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{in the middle of a}} step).|$|E

2500|$|Although {{she feels}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> the fulcrum, Agnes {{begins and ends}} the play on her musings of insanity. She wonders if she could just {{suddenly}} slip off into madness and what that would be like. She wonders what her husband would do if that happened. Would she be an embarrassment to him? Embarrassment {{is a very large}} issue with Agnes. She is easily embarrassed by her sister Claire, who Agnes believes has wasted her life and her potential. When Claire insists that she is not an alcoholic, Agnes states sarcastically, “that’s very nice.” Then she lists times that Claire has vomited, fallen down, and called from the club to have someone come and get her. She concludes this commentary with the words: “If we change for the worse with drink, we are an alcoholic.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{both men}} are drunk, they both realize that she is back on morphine, {{although}} Mary attempts to act <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not. Jamie, has not returned home, but has elected instead to continue drinking and to visit the local whorehouse. After calling Jamie a [...] "hopeless failure" [...] Mary warns that his bad influence will drag his brother down as well. After seeing the condition that his wife is in, her husband expresses the regret that he bothered to come home, and he attempts to ignore her as she continues her remarks, which include blaming him for Jamie’s drinking, and noting that the Irish are stupid drunks. Then, as often happens in the play, Mary and James try to get over their animosity and attempt to express their love for one another by remembering happier days. When James goes to the basement to get another bottle of whiskey, Mary continues to talk with Edmund.|$|E
2500|$|As Virginia {{returns home}} she feels, as did Laura Brown in the {{previous}} chapter, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> impersonating herself, as if the person she is presenting herself to be requires artifice. She puts on this 'act' to convince herself and others that she is 'sane' and so Leonard will agree {{with the idea of}} moving back to London. Virginia understands that there is [...] "true art" [...] in the requirement for women such as herself to act as they do. Feeling in control of her 'act' she goes to speak to the cook, Nelly, about lunch. However, Nelly, with her petty grievances and implicit demands that the daily life of running the house which is Virginia's domain, be observed, overwhelms Virginia. Nelly appears to have a matronly competence whilst Virginia {{does not seem to have}} a house-wifey bone in her body. Virginia decides to give her character, Clarissa Dalloway, the great skill with servants that she herself does not possess.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Will {{you allow}} me to offer you a little lunch?' he asked, hesitatingly, with {{something}} of Herbert's stately politeness. Even in this last extremity, Ronald felt instinctively what was due to Selah Briggs's natural sentiments of pride and delicacy. He must speak to her deferentially <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> a lady, not give her alms <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> a beggar.|$|R

2500|$|Silas plots to {{discredit}} Lynsey {{by making it}} seem <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> having a breakdown. Silas plans to send Lynsey mad {{so that no one}} will listen to her. Rawle said that Silas delights in the idea that Lynsey thinks she is good enough to play him. Silas puts a webcam in Lynsey's flat in order to watch her. He sneaks into the house and plays tricks on Lynsey by turning the gas on and writing a [...] "sinister" [...] message on her mirror with lipstick. Of this, Rawle explained: [...] "Silas alters Lynsey's reality — so when she insists that one thing is happening, it appears not to be the case the next minute." [...] Silas sneaks into Lynsey's flat at night and moves her things around which Rawle said is [...] "a subtle way of sending a person barmy". Lynsey's friends do not believe her accusations and question her state of mind, so she leaves the village. Lynsey's friend, Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan), sees Silas watching Lynsey as she is leaving and Hassan said that [...] " [...] starts to think there's something odd about him".|$|E
2500|$|Parnok’s {{works are}} filled with the timbre of tragedy and the melody of coincidence. Her first poem was printed in 1906 and her last, the week before her death. Her first {{collection}} Стихотворения (Poems) was published in 1916 and her last book of works Вполголоса (Half-Whispered or In a low voice) was published in 1928. She created five books of poems, more than 30 critical essays, and several translations. Sofia Polyakova, editor of Parnok's Collected Works, preserved 261 of her poems. Because she chose to live openly and write about her relationships with seven women – to each of whom she dedicated several poems – she {{came to be called}} the [...] "Russian Sappho". Much of the scholarly work focused on Parnok has centered around the period of her relationship with Tsvetaeva;, yet many of her [...] "best poems" [...] were created after 1928. Nearly 100 poems, written between 1928 and 1933 were never published until long after her death. Poems from her Vedeneyeva period reflect both material and spiritual intake and musical and creative output. They incorporate the themes running through all her works: [...] "anguish, poetry, the elements (wind, water, earth, fire), heat and cold, illness, madness, remembering, and death". Parnok's mature poetry showed a simpler use of language, shorter lines and rhythmic variation. While rejecting the Romantic poetry of previous eras, Parnok conveyed passion through the use of commonplace straightforward language. Her style employs rhetorical questioning, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> having conversations with herself, indicators that even in the presence of others, Parnok felt removed from them.|$|E
2500|$|In {{regard to}} being {{asked if she}} is putting on a geeky and gaming persona for the cameras, Hex {{explains}} that it [...] "would be so impossible to manufacture a whole persona" [...] across all the different platforms that she uses to interact with people. Hex said the capture and logging is the most challenging part of the job, {{but it is also}} unique <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> referencing a particular part of the game, she can show her own personal experience rather than rolling stock footage. Bajo says this is also for editorial reasons in that, [...] "We need to defend our point by showing the footage to satisfy the ABC's charter." [...] Bajo notes that in the show's early days, there were some intense forum flames over things like missing a detail out, or not agreeing with the general consensus among viewers. He also says {{that if there is a}} genre of games that he and Hex don't like or aren't very good at, such as sports games, they won't ignore it and will try to be as honest as possible with their reviews. Bajo says that as people invest so many hours into a game, it is justified to feel a sense of ownership over it and feel defensive if someone doesn't feel the same way. For this reason he loves [...] "getting to the bottom of" [...] why certain games are liked by some and disliked by others. Bajo says you can't speak with conviction if you haven't done something, especially [...] " [...] something as involving as games". Bajo explains [...] " [...] the odd publisher/developer who wasn't happy with our review [...] we try to be fair, honest, and listen to all feedback we get to make sure we're not ever crossing any lines." ...|$|E
