40|$|As {{part of the}} US-Russian Lab-to-Lab {{program for}} {{strengthening}} nuclear material protection, control, and accounting (MPC&A), a testbed facility {{has been established in}} a laboratory of the VNIIEF to demonstrate safeguards technology to nuclear facility operators. The design of the testbed MPC&A system provides the functions of nondestructive measurements for plutonium and highly enriched uranium, item control, personnel access control, radiation portal monitoring, search equipment, and computerized on-line accounting. The system controls, monitors, and accounts for nuclear material and people as the material moves through three MBAs. It also assists with physical inventory taking. A total of 39 instruments and control systems are being demonstrated in the present version of the testbed. Of these, about half are of Russian design and fabrication, including the software for the item monitoring and the accounting systems. These two computer systems are on an ethernet network and connected in a client-server local area architecture. The item monitoring system is integrated with the accounting system, providing <b>alarm</b> <b>and</b> <b>status</b> information to a central dispatcher terminal. The operation of the MPC&A testbed has been demonstrated under routine <b>and</b> <b>alarm</b> conditions in collaboration with safeguards staff from the six participating US national labs. Workshops and training for Russian nuclear facility operators are in progress. As needs for additional MPC&A technology at specific plants are identified, these are incorporated into the testbed and used to certify the hardware and software for implementation at the plant...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of UHF radio and closed-circuit television systems in the Black River room and pillar limestone mine near Butler, Pendleton County, Kentucky. Prior to designing the radio system, measurements of signal attenuation on 812 and 466 mHz {{were made in the}} slope tunnel and in the straight and level crosscuts in the mine. Two distributed antenna systems fed by two sets of base stations provide approximately 75 % coverage of the mine. Passive reflectors are used for extending signals into intersecting crosscuts and two-way signal boosters will be used to extend signals to the perimeter and obstructed areas of the mine. Fourteen mine vehicles were equipped with mobile radios equipped with digital identification, <b>alarm</b> <b>and</b> <b>status</b> encoders. Fifteen portable transceivers also were used. Six closed-circuit television cameras provide surveillance of critical transfer points of the belt conveyor system, and the loading dock {{at the base of the}} slope and an ash disposal area in the mine. Two-way radio communication and closed-circuit television have saved considerable man. hours, increased production, reduced maintenance costs and enhanced safety. Innovative developments were the use of passive reflectors and two-way signal boosters for extending signals into intersecting crosscuts, development of lightweight signal margin measuring equipment, modifications of mobile digital encoders to automatically send status information from mine vehicles such as numbers of loads of ore delivered, hot engine, etc., and the use of CATV technology for multiplexing audio, digital and video signals onto coaxial cables from the surface to the mine...|$|R

40|$|The article {{describes}} {{a study conducted}} on general surgical and thoracic surgical floors of a 1000 -bed hospital {{to assess the impact}} of a new network for portable patient care devices. This network was developed to address the needs of hospital patients who need constant, multi-parameter, vital signs surveillance, but do not require intensive nursing care. Bedside wall jacks were linked to UNIX-based workstations using standard digital network hardware, creating a flexible system (for general care floors of the hospital) that allowed the number of monitored locations to increase and decrease as patient census and acuity levels varied. It also allowed the general care floors to provide immediate, centralized vital signs monitoring for patients who unexpectedly became unstable, and permitted portable monitors to travel with patients as they were transferred between hospital departments. A disk-based log within the workstation automatically collected performance data, including patient demographics, monitor <b>alarms,</b> <b>and</b> network <b>status</b> for analysis. The log has allowed the developers to evaluate the use and performance of the system...|$|R

Modern ships have an automatic system control which includes control, <b>alarm</b> <b>and</b> monitoring system that have access to all process control station and can monitor them. The control system control several types of self-running process control station, each type is dictated to specific task. The alarm system is connected to sensors everywhere in the ship and continuously monitors them, if any sensor reading is outside the preset limits we get an alarm. The monitoring system can record any <b>alarm</b> <b>status</b> <b>and</b> save it in hard disk or printer with time stamp. The alarm system depends mainly on data coming from different sensors connected to corresponding measuring points. In small ship this system can be small LCD and LED panel but in a large ship {{it can be a}} computer and many displays. The sensor data can be current loop, voltage contact or open collector digital data. The number of points and scan rate is considered, also an inhibit control can be applied to certain alarm group for disable at certain conditions for the system...|$|R
40|$|Today CERN's {{facilities}} {{are equipped with}} automatic smoke and gas detection systems. Upon smoke or gas leak detection, local safety actions are automatically performed <b>and</b> <b>alarms</b> indicating the location and type of danger are transmitted to the CERN Fire Brigade. The firefighters then size their intervention {{based on the information}} received. The increasing complexity, size and quantity of CERN installations drives safety systems to evolve in the direction of simplicity. Intuitive interfaces are required to cope with high turnover of firefighters, and the inherent multinational environment. Global overview of <b>alarms</b> <b>and</b> safety actions <b>statuses</b> are needed by firefighters to decide on the best strategy for intervention. In some emergency situations, it might be necessary to manually trigger remote actions. CERN is studying a new concept, inspired by French standards, where the detection and protection layers are separated and act independently, but provide a common interface. This paper presents an application of this concept for the SPS* accelerator. Detection, fire-compartment and evacuation zones are presented, as well as the architecture of the detection and protection layers...|$|R
40|$|A {{manually}} operated, electromechanically actuated neurosurgical probe-guide {{capable of}} sensing probe-tip force {{has been designed}} and built. Three methods of displaying the probe-tip force have been investigated: audio, visual and tactile. The audio feedback sounds an alarm when the force goes above the acceptable threshold. The visual display provides information about the <b>alarm</b> <b>status</b> <b>and</b> force magnitude. The tactile display uses a small tactor to translate force information into touch. The differences between the methods were tested {{in a series of}} experiments involving seven subjects operating the neurosurgical probe-guide while relying on one of the methods of feedback. Results show that visual feedback is better than audio or tactile feedback; mainly due to the extra information that visual feedback is able to provide...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to assess the state of fire {{prevention}} research, provide an updated synthesis of evaluated fire prevention programs, and discuss the role of fire fighters and data systems in prevention efforts. The review included all evaluations of U. S. based fire prevention interventions published between January 1998 and September 2004 and any earlier articles about U. S. fire prevention interventions not included in two prior review articles. We retrieved information from each identified study including evaluation findings, involvement of fire service personnel and use of existing data systems. We identified twelve articles: seven reported on smoke alarm interventions, three on multi-faceted programs, and two other programs. Five programs involved fire service personnel in the design, implementation, and/or evaluation, and three used existing data systems. Studies reviewed suggest that canvassing <b>and</b> smoke <b>alarm</b> installations are the most effective means of distributing <b>alarms</b> <b>and</b> increasing the functional status of distributed alarms. The functionality of smoke alarms, an issue noted in earlier reviews, remains a problem. Programs involving partnerships with fire departments have indicated success in preventing fires and deaths, improving smoke <b>alarm</b> ownership <b>and</b> functional <b>status,</b> <b>and</b> improving children’s fire safety knowledge. Using existing data systems to target and to evaluate interventions was effective. In the years since prior reviews, some improvements in the rigor of evaluation designs have been made, but there is still a need for high quality evaluations that will inform fire injury prevention efforts...|$|R
40|$|Network service {{providers}} {{are struggling to}} reduce cost {{while at the same}} time improving customer satisfaction. This thesis addresses three relevant underlying challenges to achievieng these goals: - managing an overwhelming flow of low-quality alarms - understanding the structure and quality of the delivered services - automation of service configurationAll of the these add to an operator's operational costs since manual work is required in order to understand the <b>alarm</b> <b>and</b> service <b>status</b> as well as for configuring new services. We propose solutions based on domain-specific languages, data-mining and self-learning. We look at how domain-models can be used to capture explicit knowledge for <b>alarms</b> <b>and</b> services. In addition, we apply data-mining and self-learning techniques to understand the alarm semantics. The alarm solution is validated with a quantitative analysis based on real <b>alarm</b> documentation <b>and</b> an <b>alarm</b> database from a large mobile service provider. A qualitative analysis of the service management solutions is given based on prototypes and input from {{service providers}}. We present an approach to alarm interfaces by providing a formal alarm model together with a domain-specic language, BASS. This means that we can verify the consistency of an <b>alarm</b> interface <b>and</b> automatically generate artifacts such as alarm correlation rules or alarm documentation based directly on the model. From a baseline without any correlation, our alarm domain-model based on vendor documentation could automatically find the root-cause alarms in 40 % of the cases. In the process of producing an alarm model from pre-existing alarm documentation for a commercial product, we found over 150 semantic warnings. We also propose a domain specific language called SALmon, which allows for efficient representation of service models, along with a computational engine for calculation of service status. Furthermore, this thesis illustrates how we can achieve automatic service configuration based on YANG, the domain-specific language standardized in the IETF. Prototypes show that the service domain-models can capture the semantics of service models, and automatically render parts of the service management solution. It is not always possible to capture expert knowledge in models. Therefore, we propose a data-mining and self-learning solution that learns alarm priorities from the decisions taken by the network administrators. The solution assigns the same severity as a human expert in 50 % of the cases compared to 17 % for the original alarm severity.

40|$|The multimission {{spacecraft}} analysis system (MSAS) {{data monitor}} is a generic software product for future real-time data monitoring and analysis. The system represents {{the status of}} a satellite constellation through the shape, color, motion and position of graphical objects floating in a three dimensional virtual reality environment. It may be used for the monitoring of large volumes of data, for viewing results in configurable displays, and for providing high level and detailed views of a constellation of monitored satellites. It is considered that the data monitor is an improvement on conventional graphic and text-based displays as it increases the amount of data that the operator can absorb in a given period, and can be installed and configured without the requirement for software development by the end user.
