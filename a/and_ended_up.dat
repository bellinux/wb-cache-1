5|$|British Governor Valentine Morris and {{military}} commander Lieutenant Colonel George Etherington disagreed {{on how to}} react <b>and</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> surrendering without significant resistance.

The area remained under Carib control until the Second Carib War of 1795.|$|E
5|$|Coutances {{was born}} in Cornwall, to Reinfrid and Gonilla. His brother was Roger fitzReinfrid, a layman and royal justice {{during the reign of}} King Henry II of England. Although the medieval chronicler and churchman Gerald of Wales related that his friend was descended from Trojan heroes who escaped the Sack of Troy <b>and</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> in Cornwall, that was a {{flattering}} invention on Gerald's part. Coutances' family was of the knightly class, and probably from Normandy originally.|$|E

5|$|Country Bill's Restaurant {{opened in}} 1964 after Ron Thomas' family {{purchased}} the business from Bill Blake for $600.

In 1978, the family purchased the building and property following the death of their landlord.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the retreat}} went awry. The Allied contingents in the centre missed their {{appointed}} position <b>and</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> scattered {{in front of}} Plataea itself. The Athenians, Tegeans and Spartans, who had been guarding {{the rear of the}} retreat, had not even begun to retreat by daybreak. A single Spartan division was thus left on the ridge to guard the rear, while the Spartans and Tegeans retreated uphill; Pausanias also instructed the Athenians to begin the retreat and if possible join up with the Spartans. However, the Athenians at first retreated directly towards Plataea, and thus the Allied battle line remained fragmented as the Persian camp began to stir.|$|E

5|$|Whilst playing {{part-time}} for Distillery he {{also worked}} at the Harland and Wolff shipbuilding company. Though the maximum wage in England discouraged many of Belfast's top players from leaving their hometown, Dougan was determined {{to leave for the}} English Football League at the earliest opportunity, particularly so following the death of his mother in June 1955. He began to attract scouts from England after helping Distillery beat Glentoran 1–0 in the second replay of the 1956 final of the Irish Cup at Windsor Park. He played mostly at half-back in the 1956–57 season as Distillery finished sixth in the Irish League <b>and</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> as runners-up in the Ulster Cup, City Cup, and County Antrim Shield.|$|E
5|$|After {{bringing}} on Carlos Tevez {{in place}} of Anderson at half time, Manchester United kicked off the second half in a different formation, with Tevez joining Ronaldo up front in a familiar 4–4–2. Both teams attempted to settle into their customary passing rhythms, but – unlike the first half – it was Barcelona who settled first; Manchester United's passes in their attacking third of the field failed to find their targets, and Iniesta eventually came away with the ball before flicking a pass through to Xavi, who played a through-ball to Henry on the left wing. The French forward turned Ferdinand inside-out, but his shot from a narrow angle was straight at Van der Sar <b>and</b> <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> {{going out for a}} throw-in. Xavi then again passed the ball out to the left flank, where Henry nonchalantly left it for the on-rushing Sylvinho; the Brazilian full-back whipped in a cross for Eto'o, but it was caught {{on the edge of the}} six-yard box by Van der Sar.|$|E
