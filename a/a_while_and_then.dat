5|$|The Przeworsk culture {{people of}} the earlier Roman period lived in small, {{unprotected}} villages, populated each by a few dozen residents at most, made up of several houses, usually set partially below the ground level (semi-sunken), each covering an area of 8–22 square meters. They knew how to dig and build wells, so the settlements didn't have to be located near bodies of water. Thirteen 2nd century wells with variously constructed timber lined walls were found at a settlement in Stanisławice, Bochnia County. Fields were being used for crop cultivation for <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> as pastures, when animal excrement helped the soil regain fertility. Once iron share plows were introduced the fields were alternated between tillage and grazing.|$|E

25|$|Traditional {{computational}} problems {{take the}} perspective that we ask a question, a computer (or a distributed system) processes {{the question for}} <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> produces an answer and stops. However, there are also problems where {{we do not want}} the system to ever stop. Examples of such problems include the dining philosophers problem and other similar mutual exclusion problems. In these problems, the distributed system is supposed to continuously coordinate the use of shared resources so that no conflicts or deadlocks occur.|$|E

One Gurkha air platoon, based with the Gurkha battalion at Seria, remained as an air platoon for <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> became C Flight 656 Sqn, then Brunei Detachment 660 Sqn in 1978, then C Flight 660 Sqn in 1979.

In each neighborhood he supervised the purchase and construction of homes and assisted home buyers in acquiring loans. He also helped establish community institutions and spoke in the local synagogue. One of his sermons inspired a wealthy philanthropist named David Reiss to underwrite the founding of another neighborhood, Beit David, in 1873.|$|E

Orwell returned home for <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> went back to Europe. He returned finally to London to cover the 1945 general election at the beginning of July. Animal Farm: A Fairy Story was published in Britain on 17 August 1945, and a year later in the US, on 26 August 1946.|$|E

On mounting, the males tries to clasp her flanks tightly. If she stands firmly, {{it is a sign}} that she is ready to mate.

It features a by-the-numbers band performance, in which Coldplay are playing in a huge, nearly empty room. The two women in the background {{were members of the}} video crew: a makeup artist/wardrobe assistant and the video commissioner. The video starts off with band playing; while they play, Chris Martin, who is sitting in a corner, gets up and joins them in the song. During the video, Martin sings directly to the camera. During the guitar solo, Martin runs up to the two women in the background, talks to them for <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> returns to sing the rest of the song. The video concludes with the band finishing the song.|$|E
500|$|Mature female bolas spiders of {{the genus}} Mastophora build [...] "webs" [...] that consist of only a single [...] "trapeze line", which they patrol. They also {{construct}} a bolas made of a single thread, tipped with a large ball of very wet sticky silk. They emit chemicals that resemble the pheromones of moths, and then swing the bolas at the moths. Although they miss on about 50% of strikes, they catch about the same weight of insects per night as web-weaving spiders of similar size. The spiders eat the bolas if they have not made a kill in about 30 minutes, rest for <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> make new bolas. Juveniles and adult males are much smaller and do not make bolas. Instead they release different pheromones that attract moth flies, and catch them with their front pairs of legs.|$|E

500|$|By February 1969, Redding {{had grown}} weary of Hendrix's {{unpredictable}} {{work ethic and}} his creative control over the Experience's music. During the previous month's European tour, interpersonal relations within the group had deteriorated, particularly between Hendrix and Redding. In his diary, Redding documented the building frustration during early 1969 recording sessions: [...] "On the first day, as I nearly expected, there was nothing doing... On the second it was no show at all. I went to the pub for three hours, came back, {{and it was still}} ages before Jimi ambled in. Then we argued... On the last day, I just watched it happen for <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> went back to my flat." [...] The last Experience sessions that included Redding—a re-recording of [...] "Stone Free" [...] for use as a possible single release—took place on April 14 at Olmstead and the Record Plant in New York. Hendrix then flew bassist Billy Cox to New York; they started recording and rehearsing together on April 21.|$|E
500|$|The {{synopsis}} {{of the film}} was provided in Moving Picture News as: [...] "The action is laid {{in the latter part}} of the eighteenth century while the story revolves about a young Scotch duke who, determined not to marry one seeking his money, searches for adventure in the Highlands, disguised as a piper. He meets, during his wanderings, Madge, the daughter of Donald Maclvor. They fall in love at sight. Unaware of Shon's real identity, the old father refuses to sanction the match. He prefers to give his daughter to the wealthy Laird of the Isla. When the girl carries this news to her lover he tells her to [...] "Be of good cheer, my bonny lass; I'll pipe them a tune of another class." [...] The wedding day is fixed and the Laird leads his melancholy fiancee forth. Shon visits the feast in the garb of a harpist. He amuses the guests for <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> throwing off his disguise, escapes with Madge from a window. But previous to this, Shon has called his clan together and when speeding away to his mansion, they cover his retreat.
