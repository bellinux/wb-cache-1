25|$|In all, Binchy {{published}} 16 novels, four short-story collections, a {{play and}} a novella. A 17th novel, A Week in Winter, was published posthumously. Her literary career began with two books of short stories: Central Line (1978) and Victoria Line (1980). She published her debut novel Light a Penny Candle in 1982. In 1983, {{it sold for}} the largest sum ever paid for a first novel: £52,000. The timing was fortuitous, as Binchy {{and her husband were}} two months behind with the mortgage at the time. However, the prolific Binchy – who joked that she could write <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could talk – ultimately became one of Ireland's richest women.|$|E
2500|$|Guachapins {{greatest}} {{moment of}} glory came {{later that year}} on 18 August 1801. On that day [...] was between Martinique and St. Lucia [...] {{when she saw the}} Guachapin in an unequal fight against a Spanish letter of marque armed with 18 brass guns - 32 and 12-pounders. Heureux sailed up <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could but even before she arrived the Spaniard had struck to Guachapin. The two-hour engagement had cost Guachapin three men killed and three wounded, and the Spaniard nearly the same. The Spaniard was the Theresa, under the command of an officer of the Spanish Navy, and had a crew of 120 men.|$|E
2500|$|While the Vizcaya {{was under}} fire, the Cristóbal Colón had drawn ahead. Within {{a little more}} than an hour, five of the six ships of the Spanish Caribbean Squadron had been {{destroyed}} or forced aground. Only one vessel, the speedy new armored cruiser Cristóbal Colón, still survived, steaming <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could for the west and freedom. Though modern in every respect and possibly the fastest ship in either fleet, Cristóbal Colón had one serious problem: She had been only recently purchased from Italy, and her main [...] armament was not yet installed because of a contractual issue with the British firm of Armstrong. She therefore sailed with empty main turrets, albeit retaining her ten [...] secondary battery. This day, speed was her primary defense.|$|E
60|$|Madeline {{replied that}} she already felt it. The wind {{appeared}} {{to penetrate the}} robes. It was cold, pure, nipping. It was so thin <b>she</b> had to breathe <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> if <b>she</b> were under ordinary exertion. It hurt her nose and made her lungs ache.|$|R
5|$|Like most {{characters}} in the Sonic series, Amy can run at superhuman speeds but not <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> Sonic. <b>She</b> attacks foes with her ever-present signature weapon, the Piko-Piko Hammer, with which she is very proficient. She also has other minor skills such as tarot card reading and dowsing.|$|R
50|$|Xing Ling's skills focus {{mainly on}} speed and agility. In The Celestial Zone II, {{she was found}} to be <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> lightning. <b>She</b> often uses her leg to steer her attacks. Often, her attacks were so swift that her opponents could not see them, leaving the opponents no chance to react.|$|R
2500|$|At a Cabinet {{meeting on}} 3 May 1939, the First Lord of Admiralty, Lord Stanhope, stated that [...] "at {{the present time}} Germany was {{building}} ships <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could but {{that she would not}} be able to exceed the 35 per cent ratio before 1942 or 1943". Chatfield, now Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence, commented that Hitler had [...] "persuaded himself" [...] that Britain had provided the Reich with a [...] "free hand" [...] in Eastern Europe in exchange for the agreement. Chamberlain stated that Britain had never given such an understanding to Germany, and he commented that he first learned of Hitler's belief in such an implied bargain during his meeting with the Führer at the Berchtesgaden summit in September 1938. In a later paper to the Cabinet, Chatfield stated [...] "that we might say that we now understood Herr Hitler had in 1935 thought that we had given him a free hand in Eastern and Central Europe in return for his acceptance of the 100:35 ratio, but that as we could not accept the correctness of this view it might be better that the 1935 arrangements should be abrogated".|$|E
60|$|Lenore nodded and, holding Dorn's arm closely, {{she walked}} <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could down the lane.|$|E
60|$|But Ol' Mistah Buzzard wouldn't {{say another}} word, so old Granny Fox started for home <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could run.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{told me to}} begone <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> I could,' <b>she</b> answered. 'But {{he looked}} so {{different}} from his usual look that I stopped a moment to stare at him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--yes--yes!" [...] exclaimed Rose, hurrying {{one word}} on the other <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> and vehemently <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could articulate--"Let us go--let us go to the darkest dungeon--darkness befits us better than light." ...|$|R
50|$|In April 1990, Enterprise {{completed}} her around-the-world deployment, arriving in Norfolk, Virginia, after having steamed more than 43000 mi (nautical). In October, the carrier moved to Newport News Shipbuilding for refueling and the Navy's largest complex overhaul refit ever attempted. On 27 September 1994, Enterprise returned to sea for sea trials, {{during which she}} performed an extended full power run <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> when <b>she</b> was new.|$|R
60|$|These {{and many}} other {{questions}} rained upon the wearer of the old costume, and she answered them <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, my fine lady, you're {{really done}} for this time,' said the wicked woman, {{and she made}} her way home <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could.|$|E
60|$|The ladye {{ran to her}} tower head, <b>As</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> cou'd hie, To see if, by her fair speeches, She cou'd {{with him}} agree.|$|E
60|$|Very little sewing {{could the}} poor girl now do, in the broken {{intervals}} that remained to her; and {{the wages of}} Mary were not only used <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> earned, but <b>she</b> anticipated two months in advance.|$|R
60|$|No. 3, {{with its}} {{blistered}} wall and rusty rail, was attained, Kunz was brought within the enclosure, and Gillian knocked <b>as</b> sharply and <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could, in {{the fear that}} her aunt might yet turn about and escape.|$|R
50|$|The other protagonist. A yellow female Wagan, she is Takuto's younger sister. While {{her walking}} speed is not <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> her brothers, <b>she</b> can jump longer distances. The sound effects she makes for her attacks are {{different}} from Takuto and previous Wagan protagonists.|$|R
60|$|Running downstairs again <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had run up, Miss Tox got {{the party}} {{out of the}} hackney-coach, and soon {{returned}} with it under convoy.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Where are they?' said an old woman, coming hobbling across <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{could from}} the {{opposite}} side of the way. 'Why did you run away from 'em?' ...|$|E
6000|$|She has ta'en {{her to her}} bigly bour [...] <b>As</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could fare; [...] And she has drank {{a sleepy}} draught, [...] That she had mixed wi' care.|$|E
6000|$|... 1. Whether Mordecai and {{the good}} men then did not pray and <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>she?</b> And if so, Whether they might not obtain at least, some little of the mercy, {{as well as those}} women? If so, ...|$|R
2500|$|... (32 knots), {{the sole}} {{member of the}} , was characterised by the Royal Navy as a battlecruiser {{throughout}} her lifetime; nonetheless some modern authorities characterise her <b>as</b> a <b>fast</b> battleship, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> appeared on paper to be an improvement over the Queen Elizabeth class.|$|R
60|$|He broke off. They {{reached the}} station, {{but they had}} dawdled on the way, and Philip had barely time to say good-night. He kissed her quickly and ran towards the wicket <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> he could. <b>She</b> stood where he left her. He was strangely {{grotesque}} when he ran.|$|R
60|$|She ran on <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could. A {{regiment}} of gigantic snowflakes came against her, {{but they}} melted when they touched her, {{and she went}} on with fresh courage.|$|E
60|$|Hot tears again surged to her eyes, as {{she would}} not let him see them, she turned quickly within, and ran <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could up to her own rooms.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bill {{stood up}} {{straight}} and wiped ’is face with his shirt-sleeve and started digging again, and then his wife just put something on and rushed downstairs <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could go.|$|E
6000|$|She {{said she}} had left her horse (unfortunate Rosinante) tied to a tree near the {{railroad}} station. Tripp and I gave her instructions to mount the patient steed <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>she</b> arrived and ride home <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> possible. There <b>she</b> was to recount the exciting adventure of a day spent with Susie Adams. She could [...] "fix" [...] Susie--I was sure of that-- and all would be well.|$|R
5000|$|The Warden (Ms. Walker): Running Camp Green Lake, she {{is known}} to be violent, abusive, and quite mean. She uses her power and {{privilege}} to get what she wants and make members of the camp to do <b>as</b> <b>she</b> pleases. She has hidden cameras, using them to spy on the members of the camp. She is often thought of to have hidden cameras in the showers, causing Stanley to be paranoid whenever he took a shower, rushing out <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> possible. <b>She</b> wears nail polish traced with rattlesnake venom, and scratches those when they displease or go against what she says. She has the members of Camp Green Lake digging holes to look for Kate Barlow's hidden treasure. She is the granddaughter of Charles [...] "Trout" [...] Walker.|$|R
50|$|Suicide by jumping {{overboard}} {{was such}} a problem that captains had to address it directly in many cases. They used the sharks that followed the ships as a terror weapon. One captain, who had a rash of suicides on his ship, took a woman and lowered her into the water on a rope, and pulled her out <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> possible. When <b>she</b> came in view, the sharks had already killed her—and bitten off {{the lower half of}} her body.|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't {{give you}} up!" [...] she cried once more--this time quite with passion; {{on which she}} got away from him <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could and left him staring after her.|$|E
60|$|Then Emily sprang up, saying, {{she must}} go. She had walked four miles, {{and she must}} get back <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could. Most likely mamma would think her at Spinney Lawn.|$|E
60|$|She {{started to}} crawl from her shelter with the {{intention}} of running after Anderssen <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could. As she drew the baby close to her she glanced down into its little face.|$|E
60|$|At midnight she was panting {{more and}} more rapidly--three times <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> normal breathing. <b>She</b> was sunk in a stupor. And Una, {{brooding}} by the bed, a crouched figure of mute tragedy in the low light, grew {{more and more}} apprehensive as her mother seemed to be borne away from her. Una started up. She would risk her mother's displeasure and bring the doctor. Just then, even Doctor Smyth of the neighborhood practice and obstetrical habits seemed a miracle-worker.|$|R
6000|$|I don't know as {{even this}} would have {{overcome}} Mrs. Quack's fears if it hadn't been for the taste of that good corn in her mouth, and her empty stomach. She couldn't, she just couldn't resist these, and presently she was back among the rushes, hunting out the corn and wheat <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>she</b> could. When at last she could eat no more, she felt so comfortable that somehow the Smiling Pool didn't seem such a dangerous place after all, and she quite forgot Farmer Brown's boy. She found a snug hiding-place among the rushes too far out from the bank for Reddy Fox to surprise her, {{and then with a}} sleepy [...] "Good night" [...] to Jerry and Peter, she tucked her head under her wing and soon was fast asleep.|$|R
60|$|Sure enough, that wake was frightful! No sooner was {{the head}} of the Sea Lion, of the Vineyard, fairly up with the stern of the Sea Lion, of Oyster Pond, than Gardiner {{perceived}} that she went off diagonally, moving quite <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> to leeward <b>as</b> <b>she</b> went ahead. This was so very obvious that a line drawn from the quarter of Roswell's craft, in a quartering direction, would almost have kept the other schooner in its range from the moment that her bow hove heavily past.|$|R
