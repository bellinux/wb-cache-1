500|$|A scuffle {{broke out}} {{when a woman}} in {{handcuffs}} was escorted from {{the door of the}} bar to the waiting police wagon several times. She escaped repeatedly and fought with four of the police, swearing and shouting, for about ten minutes. Described as [...] "a typical New York butch" [...] and [...] "a dyke–stone butch", she had been hit on the head by an officer with a baton for, as one witness claimed, complaining that her handcuffs were too tight. Bystanders recalled that the woman, whose identity remains unknown (Stormé DeLarverie has been identified by some, including herself, as the woman, but accounts vary), sparked the crowd to fight when she looked at bystanders and shouted, [...] "Why don't you guys do something?" [...] After an officer picked her up and heaved her {{into the back of the}} wagon, the crowd became a mob and went [...] "berserk": [...] "It was <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> the scene became explosive." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{effective}} change of pace, Harrison {{picked up his}} acoustic guitar, now alone on the stage save for Pete Ham on a second acoustic, and Don Nix's gospel choir, off to stage-left. The ensuing [...] "Here Comes the Sun" [...] – the first live performance of the song, as for Harrison's other Beatle compositions played that day – was also warmly received. At this point, Harrison switched back to his white Fender Stratocaster electric guitar and, as recounted to Anthony DeCurtis in 1987, {{he looked down at}} the setlist taped to the body of the guitar and saw the word [...] "Bob" [...] followed by a question mark. [...] "And I looked around," [...] Harrison recalled of Bob Dylan's entrance, [...] "and he was so nervous – he had his guitar on and his shades – he was sort of coming on, coming ... It was only <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> I knew for sure he was going to do it." [...] Among the audience, Schaffner wrote, there was [...] "total astonishment" [...] at this new arrival.|$|E

2500|$|Her {{most famous}} poem, [...] "Solitude", was first {{published}} in the February 25, 1883 (?) issue of The New York Sun. The inspiration for the poem came as she was travelling to attend the Governor's inaugural ball in Madison, Wisconsin. On her way to the celebration, there was a young woman dressed in black sitting across the aisle from her. The woman was crying. Miss Wheeler sat next to her and sought to comfort her {{for the rest of the}} journey. When they arrived, the poet was so depressed that she could barely attend the scheduled festivities. As she looked at her own radiant face in the mirror, she suddenly recalled the sorrowful widow.

2500|$|Bourguiba {{had also}} {{reacted to the}} {{statement}} of Maurice Viollette, governor-general of Algeria, who proclaimed [...] "North Africa {{is an integral part}} of France and that it was impossible for France to abandon a bit of it". 1930 was the peak of French colonization in North Africa, which led France to celebrate the centenary of the French conquest of Algeria, by organizing a eucharistic congress in Tunisia. On this occasion, millions of Europeans invaded the capital city and went to the Saint-Lucien de Carthage cathedral, disguised in crusaders, which humiliated and revolted the people who protested against what they considered, as a violation of an Islam land by Christendom. The protestors, strongly repressed, were brought to Justice and some of had Bourguiba for lawyer, as he did not participate in the event. He also remained neutral when Tahar Haddad was dismissed of his duties of notary. He estimated <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>that</b> the main goals were political, while other problems of society are secondary, insisting on the Tunisian personality and identity that had to affirm, declaring: [...] "Let us be what we are before becoming what we will".|$|E
2500|$|The episode [...] "Company Man" [...] {{begins with}} the hostage-taking of the Bennet family by Sprague and Parkman, who are in search of answers. Noah Bennet has revelations about his company during this situation, showing that he {{initially}} came to work for [...] "The Company" [...] {{under the supervision of}} a man named Thompson, and partnered with Claude. He is eventually ordered to kill Claude, because Claude apparently was hiding [...] "one of them" [...] from The Company. During the confrontation with Sprague, Thompson comes through the back door and shoots Ted, who goes into an uncontrolled radioactive state. Noah Bennet and Matt escape the house, while Claire tranquilizes Sprague. After this, Matt and Ted are taken to the paper factory. Thompson asks Bennet when Claire should be showing up at the factory. It is <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> Bennet realizes he's too attached to Claire. The graphic novel [...] "Family Man" [...] reveals that, at this point, Noah Bennet decides that he must do what he can to save Claire and [...] "bring down the people [...] work for." [...] Having noticed that he is being followed by someone from The Company, Noah Bennet drives to a cybercafé and sends a message to Hana asking for help, which she agrees to do. The episode ends with Noah Bennet taking Claire to the same bridge on which he shot Claude so many years ago. The Haitian shows up, and Bennet instructs the Haitian to shoot him in the stomach, then [...] "Go deep" [...] and wipe anything out of his memory that could lead [...] "them" [...] to Claire. The Haitian follows the order, then takes Claire away to protect her, as instructed.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the night}} of December 25, 1925, Lonergan and five of his men entered the Adonis Social Club during a Christmas celebration. Lonergan and the other White handers, {{according}} to witnesses, were intoxicated and being unruly to other patrons. Lonergan himself loudly and openly called nearby customers [...] "wops", [...] "dagos" [...] and other ethnic slurs. When three local Irish girls entered the club escorted by their Italian dates, Lonergan chased them out supposedly yelling at them to [...] "Come back with white men, fer chrissake!" [...] It was <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> {{the lights went out}} and gunfire was heard. Customers rushed for the exits in a panic as glass was shattered as well as tables and chairs being overturned. As police arrived, they found one of Lonergan's men, his best friend Aaron Harms, dead in the street and they followed a blood trail into the club where they found Lonergan and drug addict Cornelius [...] "Needles" [...] Ferry on the dance floor near a player piano shot execution style. A fourth member, James Hart, managed to escape, having been found a few blocks away crawling on the sidewalk after being shot in the thigh and leg. He was taken to the Cumberland Street Hospital where he eventually recovered but refused to cooperate with police. He denied being at the club claiming he had been shot by a stray bullet from a passing car. The two other members, Joseph [...] "Ragtime Joe" [...] Howard and Patrick [...] "Happy" [...] Maloney, were apparently unaccounted for leaving no witnesses willing to testify. Although seven men had been arrested in connection to the shooting, including a visiting Al Capone, all the men were released on bail ranging from $5,000 to $10,000 and the case was eventually dismissed.|$|E
