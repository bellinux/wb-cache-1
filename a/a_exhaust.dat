Evaporative emissions from {{the fuel tank}} and the carburettor are inevitable from gasoline or gasoline like fuel operating vehicle because of their highly evaporative nature.

40|$|A {{new high}} AN 2 last LP stage turbine has been {{developed}} to provide leading performance for turbomachines in the 21 st Century. It required a multi-disciplinary design approach involving aerodynamics, new materials (forged γ- Titanium Aluminide alloy), mechanics (stress and vibration) and new manufacturing technologies. The objective of the design was to achieve around 5 % gain in last stage total-to-static efficiency,relative to the current competitive datum, for a very compact machine with few parts count ie reduced cost. It will be shown that the new material allows the optimum aerodynamic design for the stage to be achieved which cannot be done with conventional nickel-based alloys. The paper will present details of the novel approaches used for the design including preliminary optimization, blading design and results from multistage 3 D viscous predictions. The new stage has been tested in a Warm Air Turbine test rig at full scale engine representative conditions. The “loop was closed” by comparing the detailed test measurements with 3 D viscous analyses. This gives high confidence in the new approaches used.

40|$|Inaugural lecture [...] Department of Botany, Rand Afrikaans University, 15 October 1969 Air {{pollution}} {{is a world}} wide problem. It {{has been known for}} centuries and had its origin {{towards the end of the}} 13 th century when coal became popular as a fuel. The problem of air pollution was largely ignored until air pollution disasters occurred in Belgium (1930), in the U. S. A. (1948), and in England (1952 and 1956). These disasters were caused by high concentrations of sulphur dioxide, and were accompanied by a large number of human fatalities. A new kind of air pollution, exhaust gas, developed with the increase in the number of motor vehicles. This was first noticed in Los Angeles, U. S. <b>A.</b> <b>Exhaust</b> gas usually consists of a mixture of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and lead. In the presence of sunlight the nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons react with the atmospheric oxygen to form secondary compounds like ozone and peroxyacetyl nitrate. These secondary compounds cause considerable damage to plants and led to extensive crop losses in Southern California. In South Africa the problem of air pollution has not reached the critical stage yet, but with the increased industrialisation rate in this country, more and stricter control measures will be required. A serious air pollution problem could, however, develop with the increase in the number of motor vehicles in South Africa. With the projected number of four million vehicles by 1990, an annual petrol consumption of about 3 870 million litre can be expected. The use of this volume of petrol will cause a daily production of 9 000 metric ton of carbon monoxide, 1 800 metric ton of hydrocarbons, 480 metric ton of nitrogen oxides and 45 metric ton of lead as air pollutants. Fifteen per cent of this will be produced in the city of Johannesburg...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} computational simulation of an unsteady two-phase gas-particle flow in a hypersonic shock tunnel. The tunnel consists of a heated shock tube, a convergent-divergent nozzle linked up with the low-pressure chamber of the tube, a test section where a model is placed, and <b>a</b> <b>exhaust</b> chamber. In calculations, {{the configuration of the}} tunnel, and the initial parameters in the high-pressure and low-pressure chambers of the shock tube were taken as in experiments carried out at TsAGI (Russia). The designed Mach number at the nozzle exit was equal to M = 6. 01. Particles were injected into the high-pressure chamber of the shock tube just before the diaphragm destructed. Their initial concentration was very low, so that the reverse effect of the dispersed phase on the carrier gas was negligible. The carrier gas flow was described by the Euler equations which were solved by the finite-volume method of the second order. In the calculation domain, an unstructured grid was used with a high concentration of nodes near the critical cross-section of the nozzle and {{in the vicinity of the}} body in the test section. Triangular and polygonal finite-volume cells were taken. The fluxes at cell boundaries were calculated using four different algorithms of the TVD-type. The best quality of the numerical solution for the flow field was obtained with the use of the modified second-order Godunov method for fluxes applied to the polygonal cells. The particle-phase flow was simulated using the Lagrangian method. A fine structure of two-phase flow was investigated from the instant of destruction of a diaphragm between high- and low-pressure chambers of the shock tube to the end of the quasi-steady-state flow over a body in the test section...|$|E
40|$|The major {{long term}} {{challenge}} for the automotive industry is the substantial reduction of greenhouse gas emissions with a simultaneous reduction in all other regulated emissions. Although local pollutant emissions (specifically NOx, CO, HC and soot) are already being addressed {{through the use of}} aftertreatment systems and higher quality fuels, new emission standards that will be enforced {{in the next few years}} will be more stringent, especially on NOx and particulate matter (PM) emissions. The diesel particulate filter technology has been established as a favourable method and a necessity for the control of diesel PM emissions. The ongoing research by the authors have aimed to develop a diesel emissions reduction system with enhanced performance by utilising hydrogen produced on-board in <b>a</b> <b>exhaust</b> gas assisted diesel fuel reformer. This type of fuel reforming process involves the on-board generation of hydrogen-containing gas by direct catalytic interaction of hydrocarbon fuels with engine exhaust gases. The aim of this work is to design a fuel reformer-CRT-DPF system. The reformate (i. e. H 2 - rich gas) will be produced and introduced continuously into the DOC part of the CRT-DPF or directly to the catalyst coated DPF, when required (i. e. low load, low exhaust temperatures) in small concentrations (i. e. below 2000 ppm H 2) in order to enhance NO to and NO 2 oxidation. Initial results using a CRT-DPF aftertreatment system showed the NO to NO 2 oxidation over the DOC enhancing as the hydrogen addition was increased from 500 – 2000 ppm; however it was found to be dependent on the engine operation (i. e. use of EGR), exhaust gas conditions and composition. The increased NO 2 concentration in the exhaust improved the soot oxidation at low temperatures and helped in maintaining a soot free DPF, as seen from the temperature changes and pressure drop trends along the filter. ...|$|E
40|$|Sunspaces {{are gaining}} {{considerable}} consumer appeal and acceptance, however, very little quantitative information exists {{in terms of}} their thermal performance in occupied houses. A major concern in the year round use of sunspaces is the control of the air temperature. This problem is usually dealt with in the design stage through proper selection of window areas and envelope thermal properties. However, even a well designed sunspace can have temperatures that fluctuate outside the thermal comfort zone for {{a significant portion of the}} year. During this time, auxiliary energy for both heating and cooling must be provided if the sunspace temperature is to remain in the comfort zone. A mathematical model that can accurately predict the thermal performance of a sunspace is required if the auxiliary energy requirements are to be examined over a range of operating strategies and under typical meteorological conditions. The sunspace model developed consists of finite difference approximations of all the major surfaces such as walls and ceilings. Heat transfer through the doors and windows and infiltration are included in the model as paths directly between the outside or house and the sunspace. Auxiliary energy, in the form of heating and air conditioning, and natural cooling has also been included in the model. Four sunspaces located in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan are examined to verify the model. Yearly simulations using Typical Meteorological Year weather data are performed on all the sunspaces to determine the auxiliary energy requirements under different strategies. These yearly simulations are extended to three other cities representative of the major climatic regions of Canada. From these simulations, operational strategies on the use of auxiliary energy for attached sunspaces are developed. Of the four sunspaces investigated only one has the potential to become a net producer of energy. However, reductions in the yearly auxiliary energy requirements of the sunspace of up to 80 % are possible when proper operating strategies are implemented. Effective operating strategies should include, • the shutting down of the sunspace from December to February to reduce the heating load of the sunspace, • venting any useful energy produced by the sunspace during the winter to the house for space heating, and, •using <b>a</b> <b>exhaust</b> fan to the outside to reduce the air-conditioning requirements of the sunspace...|$|E
