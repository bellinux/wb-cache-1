25|$|The deities of Hinduism {{have evolved}} from the Vedic era (2nd {{millennium}} BCE) through the medieval era (1st millennium CE), regionally within Nepal, India and in southeast Asia, and across Hinduism's diverse traditions. The Hindu deity concept varies from a personal god as in Yoga school of Hindu philosophy,Lloyd Pflueger, Person Purity and Power in Yogasutra, in Theory and Practice of Yoga (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 38-39;Kovoor T. Behanan (2002), Yoga: Its Scientific Basis, Dover, , pages 56-58 to 33 Vedic deities, to hundreds of Puranics of Hinduism. Illustrations of major deities include Vishnu, Sri (Lakshmi), Shiva, Parvati (Durga), Brahma and Saraswati. These deities have distinct and complex personalities, yet are often viewed as aspects of the same Ultimate Reality called Brahman. From ancient times, the idea of equivalence has been cherished for all Hindus, in its texts and in early 1st millennium sculpture with concepts such as Harihara (half Shiva, half Vishnu), Ardhanarishvara (half Shiva, half Parvati) or Vaikuntha Kamalaja (half Vishnu, half Lakshmi), with myths and temples that feature them together, declaring they are the same. Major deities have inspired their own Hindu traditions, such as Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism, but with shared mythology, ritual grammar, theosophy, <b>axiology</b> and polycentrism.

40|$|The term naturalism arouses strong emotions; {{religious}} naturalism even more. In this essay, naturalism is {{explored in}} a variety of contexts, in contrast to supernaturalism (in metaphysics), normativism (in ethics and epistemology), and rationalism (in the philosophy of mind). It is argued that religious naturalism becomes a “thick” naturalism, a way of life rather than just a philosophical position. We can discern a subculture with a historical identity, a variety of dialects, stories that evoke attitudes and feelings, as well as more systematic theological elaborations. In this context, religious naturalists are called to thicken further the ways of life that embody their religious and naturalist sensitivities. In order to speak of a naturalist theology in this context, one has to define theology in a way that avoids assumptions regarding the supernatural; this can be achieved by presenting theologies as particular combinations of cosmologies (informed by the sciences) and <b>axiologies</b> (values) ...|$|R

The value for learning from difference has implications for other inclusions in the methodological bricolage we employ in our research. Also central is dialogue as a characteristic of verbal interaction within and between individuals. That is, speech, whether it is inner or outer, has a recursive nature that is expansive {{in the sense that it}} opens up fresh ways of thinking about what is known, what is happening, what is valued, and what is possible and desirable (Bakhtin 1986). Accordingly, research methodology also includes the activity of cogen, which incorporates dialogue, collaborating with others, radical listening, right speech, mindfully speaking, and learning from difference.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 An {{overarching}} {{explanation for}} environmental degradation has been humans' disconnection {{from the natural}} world.

I utilize ethics of care to demonstrate our need for recognizing relationships and taking responsibility for our actions.

I argue that through gardening and local foods we can cultivate a better understanding of our reliance upon each-other and the land. In addition, we reduce global human/land exploitation and oppression.

40|$|In Axel Honneth’s Freedom’s Right (FR) {{personal}} relations, {{among which}} Honneth {{includes not only}} family and partner relationships but friendship as well, enable the realization of one ‘specific form of freedom, which is difficult to specify’ (FR 233). This assertion constitutes {{one of the main}} thesis of Freedom’s Right. Accordingly, ‘freedom in the sense of individual autonomy’ should, among countless different ‘conceptions of freedom’ be understood as the only one that has the power to shape modern society, while all other values effective within modernity should be understood as ‘aspects of the constitutive idea of individual autonomy’ (FR 35). In this paper we argue that Honneth’s discussion of the value of friendship does not accomplish its aim for three reasons: first, Honneth is compelled by his argument to postulate one radical cleavage internal to the concept of friendship, by way of an exaggerated contrast between ancient and modern forms of friendship. Second, in his discussion Honneth marginalizes other existing <b>axiologies</b> of friendship, which attribute some other important instrumental, constitutive and final values to this term. Third, even a weaker thesis, one that treats the value of friendship as the precondition of individual freedom as a primus inter pares, seems to lose sight of the central importance that friendship has for us. ” Honneth’s key thesis about the unique value of friendship in our society is thereby challenged...|$|R
40|$|This {{discussion}} paper argues for {{the centrality of}} Aboriginal Spirituality {{in the practice of}} social and emotional wellbeing and for applications in all areas of Aboriginal development. Although often mentioned in the literature on Aboriginal health and social and emotional wellbeing, Spirituality has been in danger of becoming one of the undefined terms—like wellbeing, community, identity—that are used in various contexts and with various meanings attached, and in ways that obscure the reality of Indigenous Australian knowledges, philosophies and practices. In common with terms such as the Dreaming, it has lost significant meaning when translated into English. This {{discussion paper}} importantly defines Aboriginal Spirituality by privileging the voices of Aboriginal people themselves and those of well-respected observers of Aboriginal culture. It demonstrates how those who are well exemplify Spirituality in everyday life and cultural expression. Having commonalities with international Indigenous groups, it is also deeply appreciated by non-Aboriginal people who understand and value the different ontologies (understandings {{of what it means to}} be), epistemologies (as ways of knowing) and <b>axiologies</b> (the bases of values and ethics) that Aboriginal philosophy embodies, as potential value to all peoples. Spirituality includes Indigenous Australian knowledges that have informed ways of being, and thus wellbeing, since before the time of colonisation, ways that have been subsequently demeaned and devalued. Colonial processes have wrought changes to this knowledge base and now Indigenous Australian knowledges stand in a very particular relationship of critical dialogue with those introduced knowledges that have oppressed them. Spirituality is the philosophical basis of a culturally derived and wholistic concept of personhood, what it means to be a person, the nature of relationships to others and to the natural and material world, and thus represents strengths and difficulties facing those who seek to assist Aboriginal Australians to become well. This discussion paper questions the advisability of approaches that incorporate an Aboriginal perspective or cultural awareness as an overlay to the Western practices of dealing with mental health issues. Western practices have developed out of an entirely different concept of personhood, development of the individual and relationships to the wider world, and further research in this area, particularly incorporating the voices of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, is critical to ways forward...|$|R

40|$|A {{semantic}} approach towards {{political conflict}} first {{emerged in the}} 1930 s and provides the methodological foundations for the description of political conflicts, in particular as {{the correlation between the}} language of description and reality. Any military or political confrontation presupposes axiological, conceptual and ideological confrontation. The form of adequate description can only be comprehended if the characteristic features of its language (structure) and thesaurus are revealed. Admitting the possibility of different descriptions implies the necessity of analysing this possible ambiguity, i. e. the characteristic features of the language which enable us to form various statements, including mutually exclusive ones. The insoluble task of finding a middle ground between the viewpoints of the conflicting parties should be replaced by soluble procedures of explaining and assessing the conflicting <b>axiologies.</b> For the description of conflict situations, when it is essential to represent various positions within a uniform system, an apparatus of model semantics seems to be the most appropriate one both for generating alternatives and for bringing them together in a modal system of a world in which procedures of transition from one world to another (i. e. the transworld compatibility between them) are also reflected. Reality is reconstructed not as a sort of middle ground between the mutually exclusive approaches nor as their sum, but {{as a result of the}} overlapping of various worlds and the procedures of transition from one state of affairs to another. The description of a conflict is therefore seen as a system of worlds connected by modal relations, with a system of worlds emerging as a reality to be described. This approach makes it possible to describe the processes from the points of view of the participating parties and, at the same time, to reveal their basic attitudes. The main idea of this research is shown by the problems analysed: the description of conflict as methodology; language and behaviour (general problems of semiotic description), the logico-semantic analysis of the notions of "problem and conflict", "Genesis and Chronology", "the recurrent model of the (historical) explanation and interpretation of the conflict". Zolyan used data on the Karabagh conflict to demonstrate the dependence of the structure of semio-cultural codes on current political development and considered post-soviet history as a semio-cultural problem. He sought to consider and reveal the logic of manipulations with history, and proposed the logic of preferences as a possible instrument for achieving compromise...|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} tourism {{research}} is {{one which is}} based on western epistemologies grounded in positivistic or post-positivistic research paradigms and by association a predilection to a quantitative research methodology. Other paradigms, methodologies, or interdisciplinary approaches have been and are utilised, however, they are relatively limited in number in regard to the primacy of literature associated with the hegemony of positivistic and postpositivistic paradigms. Given current world circumstances, should such a history continue to inform tourism and travel today? As readers would be aware, the closing {{decades of the twentieth century}} were punctuated with rapid social, cultural, technological, economic and political change along with a multiplicity of natural and human-induced 'disasters'; all on a scale and level that significantly contributed to global instability, uncertainty and unpredictability. Similar changes and disasters continue into the twenty-first century. The complexity of the resultant interactions and their distributions across global contexts, especially for tourism economics and management, have demonstrated that a reliance on past (hegemonic/dominant/western) practices, especially linear causal-effect explanations and reliance on historical patterns are proving problematic for explaining current and future tourism patterns and phenomena. New, marginalised and different world views (ontologies), ways of knowing (epistemologies), methodologies and methods as well as <b>axiologies</b> (morals and values) need to be used to provide (rapid and flexible) responses to travel and tourism issues to better serve the industry, to develop and refine theory as well as to understand the phenomenon of tourism in ever changing globalscapes and global interconnectivity. Based on action research over a ten year period of involvement in research and training in tourism economics and management along with the use of heuristic research processes, the following advances in tourism research are proffered in order to meet the current and future needs of tourism economics and management, especially for researchers and end-point users. The advances include: knowledge and use of a broader suite of research paradigms; understanding, awareness, incorporation and use of a variety of epistemological viewpoints; knowledge and use of qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods and indigenous methodologies; development, refinement and use of interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches; collaborations across stakeholder groups; multimember team membership in order to represent the diversity amongst researchers and stakeholders; team skilling including cross-cultural capacity building; monitoring and mediation of power dynamics within teams and overall research projects; research foci which address local, regional and international spaces in an integrated manner; and multi-genre outputs to accommodate diverse stakeholder audiences.
