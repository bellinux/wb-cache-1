25|$|The Air Tractor AT-802 is an {{agricultural}} aircraft that {{may also be}} adapted into fire-fighting or armed versions. It first flew in the United States in October 1990 and is manufactured by Air Tractor Inc. The AT-802 carries a chemical hopper between the engine firewall and the cockpit and another one under the belly. In the U.S., it is considered a Type III SEAT, or Single Engine <b>Air</b> <b>Tanker.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1958, CAL FIRE, then CDF, {{contracted}} {{with a private}} <b>air</b> <b>tanker</b> service {{for the use of}} their converted World War II aircraft. By 1970 the department began to evaluate the use of former military Grumman S-2 aircraft. Over the next ten years CAL FIRE continued to build up its fleet of S-2A air tankers and in 1987, CAL FIRE began the process of converting their piston engines to turboprop. By 2005 all of CAL FIRE's airtanker fleet had been converted to S-2T air tankers.|$|E

2500|$|Firefighting <b>air</b> <b>tanker</b> {{versions}} {{of both the}} BAe 146 and the Avro RJ85 have been manufactured via the conversion of aircraft previously operated by airlines in scheduled passenger service. Several organisations carry out such conversions, including U.S.-based Minden Air Corporation, Neptune Aviation Services, and Aero-Flite, a U.S. subsidiary of Canadian-based Conair Group. In January 2012, Conair Group announced its arrangements to market and promote the Avro RJ85 as a major <b>air</b> <b>tanker</b> platform. [...] In October 2012, Air Spray Aviation of Alberta, Canada purchased its first BAe 146 for conversion into an <b>air</b> <b>tanker.</b> Air Spray purchased a second airframe for conversion in October 2013.|$|E

2500|$|Commercial {{refueling}} companies Omega Aerial Refueling Services and Global <b>Air</b> <b>Tanker</b> Service operate two KDC-10 tankers (N974VV and N852V, respectively) for lease. [...] They {{were converted}} from DC-10-40s and provide probe and drogue refueling capabilities from wing pods {{similar to the}} KC-10. [...] In June and July 2011, Omega Air's KDC-10 supported 3 of Royal Australian Air Force's F/A-18 Hornets, en route to Red Flag – Alaska.|$|E
2500|$|During the mid-1950s, A-26s {{were tested}} {{and used as}} <b>air</b> <b>tankers</b> for {{suppression}} of forest and wildland fires, and may have briefly used borate-based retardants, hence the inaccurate and unofficial term [...] "borate bombers." [...] Borate was soon discontinued due to its undesirable ecologic effects, replaced with retardant mixtures of water, clays, fertilizers and red dyes. That use of A-26s on USDA contracts was discontinued in major regions by about 1973, when many of the A-26 <b>air</b> <b>tankers</b> then found willing purchasers in Canada.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) {{acquired}} seven OV-10As {{for use as}} fire-fighting aircraft, {{including the}} YOV-10A prototype. In this role, they lead firefighting <b>air</b> <b>tankers</b> through their intended flight paths over their target areas. The aircraft were operated in their basic military configurations, but with their ejection seats disabled. The aircraft's existing smoke system was used to mark the path for the following <b>air</b> <b>tankers.</b> Given {{the age of the}} aircraft, spare parts were difficult to obtain, and the BLM retired their fleet in 1999.|$|R

2500|$|Eventually, a Forest Service {{contracting}} officer {{determined that}} the exchanges had been illegal, and on December 1, 1998, the Forest Service asserted ownership of the aircraft and ruled that the aircraft must be returned. [...] "The original exchange agreements for the transfer of aircraft are void because we didn't {{have the authority to}} conduct an exchange. I have been working to resolve concerns about the <b>air</b> <b>tanker</b> program raised in the OIG audit and issued the letter asserting aircraft ownership on behalf of the Agency," [...] stated Ron Hooper, staff assistant to the Forest Service Deputy Chief for Business Operations, the contracting officer who made the determination of ownership, and who would later testify to that effect in court. In letters sent to the operators, the Forest Service also said that they were prepared to return the titles of the historical aircraft then in museums, many of which were no longer flyable. The airtanker operators sued and eventually prevailed against this ruling. The assertion of ownership ruling allowed for continued operation of eleven of the aircraft which were scheduled to be used under the 1999 National <b>Air</b> <b>Tanker</b> Contract (five other operable aircraft were in the possession of companies who either were unsuccessful in their bid for the contract, or simply chose not to bid; the aircraft, the USFS stated, must still be maintained and used only for firefighting purposes).|$|E

2500|$|The DC-10 <b>Air</b> <b>Tanker</b> is {{a series}} of American {{wide-body}} jet air tankers, which have been in service as an aerial firefighting unit since 2006. The aircraft, operated by the joint technical venture 10 Tanker Air Carrier, are converted wide body McDonnell Douglas DC-10 passenger jetliners, and are primarily used to fight wildfires, typically in rural areas. The turbofan-powered aircraft carry up to 12,000 US gallons (45,000 liters) of water or fire retardant in an exterior belly-mounted tank, the contents of which can be released in eight seconds. Two air tankers are currently in operation, with the call-signs Tanker 911 and Tanker 912. A third, [...] "Tanker 910" [...] was retired in 2014 ...|$|E

[...] The initial report estimated the fire to be approximately [...] [...] A few minutes later, the lookout reported that the fire had doubled in size and was growing rapidly due to gusty winds in the area. [...] In the meantime, the interagency fire center dispatched ground crews and a helicopter to fight the fire. [...] Within a half-hour, the lookout reported a new spot fire west of the main blaze. [...] When the helicopter arrived on the scene, its pilot reported that the fire was , burning in heavy timber. [...] The helicopter also reported more spot fire up to [...] ahead of the main fire. [...] Based on that report, the fire center requested <b>air</b> <b>tanker</b> support. [...] There were no large air tankers available, but two smaller retardant planes were dispatched. [...] The air tankers made several drops, but had to retire at dusk. [...] The ground attack continued through the night with hand crews, pumper engines, and bulldozers.|$|E

50|$|The U.S. Forest Service {{developed}} the Modular Airborne FireFighting System for the C-130 in the 1970s, which allows regular aircraft to be temporarily converted to an airtanker for fighting wildfires. In the late 1980s, 22 retired USAF C-130As {{were removed from}} storage at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base and transferred to the U.S. Forest Service, which then illegally transferred them to six private companies to be converted into <b>air</b> <b>tankers.</b> After one of these aircraft crashed due to wing separation in flight {{as a result of}} fatigue stress cracking, the entire fleet of C-130A <b>air</b> <b>tankers</b> was permanently grounded in 2004.
