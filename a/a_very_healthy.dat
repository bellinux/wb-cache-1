Later that season, Crossland was found to have broken his residential qualification for Lancashire by living in Nottinghamshire, and Nash dropped out of the side.

2500|$|The cost of {{upgrading}} the schools {{when they were}} integrated {{and the need to}} ensure that facilities were not duplicated led Bishop Gaines, the first Catholic Bishop of Hamilton, to decide to amalgamate the schools. For example, the Education Department estimated the cost of upgrading Edmund Rice and MacKillop Colleges to meet integration requirements at $1.2 million. [...] "The decision was surprisingly controversial, and the consultation process could have been done better. There was a feeling among some that the decision to amalgamate had been taken, and that any consultation was simply 'going through the motions'." [...] "Bishop Gaines drove the change and it was his financial genius which pulled off the sale, and later the purchase back of [...] McKillop , for <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>healthy</b> profit to the school. The funds from the initial sale enabled John Paul College to build and refurbish, {{to meet the needs of}} the growing numbers of students." [...] The amalgamation was completed in May 1987 and Edmund Rice College and MacKillop College closed. Edmund Rice College was in its 25th year. The Christian Brothers Community was reduced to three, was relocated in rented accommodation nearby, and the Brothers former home became the administration centre of John Paul College. In May, 1987, John Paul College opened its doors to 687 students. For a time the new school operated in both places, but the former Edmund Rice College was chosen for the new site because it had more potential for development. At the end of 1989 the Christian Brothers Community was withdrawn from Rotorua. The MacKillop buildings have produced rental income for the college.|$|E
