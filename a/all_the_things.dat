5|$|I {{think it}} was really special to have behind-the-scenes photos, you know, {{pictures}} that the fans haven't seen before, all together of a very specific moment of my life, an album of my life. They just get to see <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that they hadn't seen {{that were going on}} behind the scenes; really cool stuff, not typical. They're really fun photos. And even for me, when I look at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E
5|$|It {{just seems}} like a feel-good record but when you really listen to the lyrics, it's about me growing up. In my household, I didn't go all of the parties and I didn't do <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> {{that a lot of}} the other teenage girls did because I was so in love with my radio and my music. I was so in love with this radio and my parents were happy that I was into {{something}} positive.|$|E
60|$|TROTTER. Pooh! {{you take}} it too seriously. After <b>all,</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> has amusing passages. Dismiss the rest as impertinence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Besides," [...] Daddy continued, {{improving}} the occasion, [...] "you must {{not think of}} the Devil as a person. You must think of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> mean <b>things</b> one could do, and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> dirty <b>things,</b> and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> cruel <b>things,</b> and that is really the Devil you are fighting against. You couldn't call them useful, could you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is, perhaps, a {{good deal}} one could say; but I fancy most of it would savour of impertinence," [...] he said. [...] "After <b>all,</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> doesn't affect you in any way." ...|$|R
5|$|Upon Irataba's {{return from}} Washington D.C., {{he met with}} the Mohave while dressed in his major general's uniform, with medals. He wore a European-style hat and carried a long Japanese sword, and he told the Mohave about <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> he had seen. He tried to {{convince}} them that peace with the United States was in their best interests, and that war against them was futile, stressing their dominant military capabilities. Many Mohave were skeptical of his reports, and reacted with disbelief.|$|E
5|$|The production’s incredible. The beat {{is just so}} {{constant}} and powerful. That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. I felt like I’d found my sound. And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what would this song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what do we need to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on <b>All</b> <b>The</b> <b>Things</b> She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E
5|$|This one I had {{the most}} amount of input. I oversaw everything—the {{building}} of the sets, everyone's costumes, I had meetings with make-up and hair and the cinematographer, everybody. Casting, finding the right cat—just every aspect. Kind of like making a little movie. We basically sat down and just threw out all every idea we could possibly conceive of and of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> we wanted. All the imagery we wanted—and I had a few set ideas, for instance the cat {{and the idea of}} Metropolis. I definitely wanted to have that influence, that look on all the men—the workers, diligently, methodically working away.|$|E
5000|$|Imam Abu Yusuf and Muhammad say: Waqf {{signifies the}} {{extinction}} of the waqif's ownership in <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> dedicated and detention of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> in <b>the</b> implied ownership of God, {{in such a manner}} that its profits may revert to or be applied [...] "for the benefit of Mankind".|$|R
5000|$|Genesis 8:17: [...] "Take out (ketiv/written: Send out) <b>all</b> <b>the</b> living <b>things</b> {{that are}} with you, from <b>all</b> <b>the</b> flesh: the birds, <b>the</b> animals, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> {{creeping}} <b>things</b> that creep over the earth; they shall swarm {{in the earth}} and be fruitful and multiply on the earth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was not at}} <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> for her to do; however, that 's neither here nor there. She {{was living}} in Federal Street at the time, a most aristocratic street then, children, and we lived close by.|$|R
5|$|Homer {{decides to}} take his family to the new sushi bar, The Happy Sumo. After {{sampling}} most of {{the items on the}} menu, he tries sushi made from fugu. The chef in charge is busy making love with Edna, so his apprentice has to slice the fish, of which certain parts are toxic. He tries to do it carefully, but Homer becomes impatient, only to have it served and become unsure if the poisonous portions have been removed. Homer considers it a treat, but the chef soon returns and believes that the fish has not been prepared correctly and tells Homer that he may have been poisoned. Homer and Marge go to the hospital, where Dr. Hibbert informs Homer that based on a chat he had with the sushi chef, Homer is found out that he has increased likeliness of death and has 22 hours left to live. At night with Marge by his side, he decides not to tell his children about the bad news and makes a list of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> he wants to do before death.|$|E
5|$|On {{his last}} day, after oversleeping, Homer {{attempts}} to do <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> on his list. He has a man-to-man talk with Bart, listens to Lisa play her saxophone, and borrows Ned's camcorder {{to make a}} video for Maggie that she can look at when she is older. Next, Homer reconciles with his father Grampa, which takes up far more time than he expects and forces him to give up doing {{some of the things}} on his list. After trying to catch up on time he lost doing these things, Homer is arrested for speeding. He calls Barney, who is asked to pay $50 to bail him out. After being acquitted, he tells off his boss Mr. Burns and has one last drink at Moe's Tavern with his friends, causing him to miss dinner with his waiting family. He then hurries home in time to say goodbye to his children and make love to Marge.|$|E
5|$|Hurt by Whatsername's departure, Johnny {{longs for}} better days ahead, Tunny longs for home, and Will longs for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> he's lost ("Wake Me Up When September Ends"). St. Jimmy appears and makes one last {{attempt to get}} Johnny's attention, but that part of Johnny has died, {{resulting}} in the metaphorical suicide of St. Jimmy ("The Death of St. Jimmy"). Johnny cleans up and gets a desk job but soon realizes {{there is no place}} for him in the city ("East 12th Street"). Will, all alone with his television, bemoans his outcast state ("Nobody Likes You"). As he finally gets up off the couch, Heather appears with her new show-off rockstar boyfriend ("Rock and Roll Girlfriend"). Will heads to the 7-Eleven to get away from them and, surprisingly, finds Johnny there. Johnny had sold his guitar for a bus ticket home. Tunny returns from the war zone (as an amputee) with the Extraordinary Girl. As Tunny introduces his friends to the Extraordinary Girl, Johnny becomes furious with him for leaving the group, but quickly forgives him and the three friends embrace. Heather and her boyfriend arrive. In an uneasy truce, she gives the baby to Will. Other friends show up to greet the three men they haven't seen in a year ("We're Coming Home Again"). One year later, Johnny laments that he lost the love of his life, but he accepts that he can live inside the struggle between rage and love that has defined his life. With this acceptance comes the possibility of hope ("Whatsername").|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Grantly sighed, {{and then}} {{attempted}} to console {{herself and her}} lord by remarking that, after <b>all,</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> was not accomplished yet. Now that Eleanor was at Plumstead, much might be done to wean her from her fatal passion. Poor Eleanor! ...|$|R
6000|$|So I {{would rather}} have a rounded, {{complete}} injustice, as we can't have the complete justice. After <b>all,</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> done is only a nation saved. Hurry up the men who did it on the same cord! Ought not Cavour to be there? ...|$|R
25|$|Another {{recognition}} {{has been}} received by Velasquez this year, which she garnered a Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role (Musical/Comedy) award for her film Of <b>All</b> <b>The</b> <b>Things</b> at the 10th Golden Screen Awards.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, Velasquez {{made her}} {{comeback}} {{in the big}} screen through her third movie team-up with Aga Muhlach, Of <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>Things</b> (film), under Viva Films. The film was shown over 120 theaters nationwide and earning 15million in opening day. It was her reunion movie with Mulach after their blockbuster films, Dahil May Isang Ikaw and Pangako Ikaw Lang.|$|E
25|$|Within {{days of his}} {{confession}} in open court, Heirens denied any responsibility for the murders. Mary Jane Blanchard, daughter of murder victim Josephine Ross, {{was one of the}} first dissenters, being quoted in 1946 as saying:I cannot believe that young Heirens murdered my mother. He just does not fit into the picture of my mother's death... I have looked at <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> Heirens stole and there was nothing of my mother's things among them.|$|E

25|$|In Svithjod {{it was the}} old custom, as long as heathenism prevailed, {{that the}} chief {{sacrifice}} took place in Goe month at Upsala. Then sacrifice was offered for peace, and victory to the king; and thither came people {{from all parts of}} Svithjod. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>Things</b> of the Swedes, also, were held there, and markets, and meetings for buying, which continued for a week: and after Christianity was introduced into Svithjod, the Things and fairs were held there as before. After Christianity had taken root in Svithjod, and the kings would no longer dwell in Upsala, the market-time was moved to Candlemas, and it has since continued so, and it lasts only three days.|$|E
25|$|In the Millennium special, S.Baldrick {{constructs}} a fake {{time machine}} from Leonardo da Vinci's sketches, despite {{his inability to}} read (combating this with his experience of constructing Airfix models). Baldrick's intelligence has risen {{to the level of}} the second Baldrick again and accidentally makes a real time machine. After a time-travel adventure, Lord Blackadder find England an extension of France, William Shakespeare having designed the ballpoint pen and no knowledge of Robin Hood whatsoever. Edmund takes <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> he gained on his journey (besides Elizabeth I's crown) and after another adventure, gets the idea to alter the timeline to become King. Predictably, Baldrick becomes his Prime Minister, finally becoming what he desired (as did Edmund) and is the second Baldrick to rise to upper class (although after Blackadder's alterations there may be more).|$|E
25|$|The {{first episode}} of Chef! was {{developed}} over two years, and so Peter Tilbury and I were really put through loads of hoops about character motivation. Why is this character such an arsehole? Is this {{the right kind}} of character for Lenny Henry to be playing? All that kind of stuff. Once we got through that and they greenlit the series, Peter then had something like eight or nine weeks to write the rest of it. The remaining five episodes were much easier to write because we'd had every argument about who, what, where, and how. The world had been mapped out. Actually, the very first episode of Chef! was the hardest one to watch for me because we'd worked so hard on it and you could see <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that had been rewritten in the first episode.|$|E

25|$|Josh Fox (born 1972) is an American film director, {{playwright and}} {{environmental}} activist, {{best known for}} his Oscar-nominated 2010 documentary, Gasland. He followed that up with the HBO production of Gasland Part II, which premiered on July 8, 2013 and was released on DVD on January 14, 2014. He {{is one of the most}} prominent public opponents of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. In 2017 he was awarded his third Environmental Media Association award for Best Documentary for his latest film How to Let Go of the World and Love <b>All</b> <b>The</b> <b>Things</b> Climate Can’t Change, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2016, toured the world theatrically and was released on HBO in June. He also is the founder and artistic director of a film and theater company in New York City called the International WOW Company.|$|E
25|$|NBA 2K16 is a {{basketball}} simulation video game {{based on the}} National Basketball Association. Like past games in the series, NBA 2K16 simulates {{the experience of the}} NBA. Players play NBA games with any real life or custom team, and can customize many aspects, such as camera angles, the presentation of players, the sound levels, and the level of realism. Like other NBA 2K games, NBA 2K16 is marketed as being as realistic as the actual NBA, with <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> featured in NBA games, such as commentary, pre-game shows, halftime shows, post-game shows, replays, interviews, crowds, and real player movement, among many other things. The pre-game, halftime, and post-game shows are hosted by Ernie Johnson, Shaquille O'Neal, and Kenny Smith. Meanwhile, the mid-game play-by-play commentary is performed by Kevin Harlan, Clark Kellogg, and Greg Anthony, while Doris Burke is the sideline reporter. The game features several online and offline game modes where players can play alone against the CPU, or against other players online.|$|E
25|$|The {{individual}} is explicitly {{told that he}} is reacting normally to extreme stress {{and is expected to}} recover and return to full duty in a few hours or days. A military leader is extremely effective in this area of treatment. Of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> said to a Service member suffering from combat stress, the words of his small-unit leader have the greatest impact due to the positive bonding process that occurs during combat. Simple statements from the small-unit leader to the Service member that he is reacting normally to combat stress and is expected back soon have positive impact. Small-unit leaders should tell Service members that their comrades need and expect them to return. When they do return, the unit treats them as every other Service member and expects them to perform well. Service members suffering and recovering from combat stress disorder are no more likely to become overloaded again than are those who have not yet been overloaded. In fact, {{they are less likely to}} become overloaded than inexperienced replacements.|$|E
