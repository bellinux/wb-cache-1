5|$|A 2008 {{study by}} John Fregeau of 13 {{globular}} clusters in the Milky Way shows {{that three of}} them have an unusually large number of X-ray sources, or X-ray binaries, suggesting the clusters are middle-aged. Previously, these globular clusters had been classified as being in old age because they had very tight concentrations of stars in their centers, another test of age used by astronomers. The implication is that most globular clusters, including the other ten studied by Fregeau, are not in middle age as previously thought, but are <b>actually</b> <b>in</b> 'adolescence'.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the heavy security, {{businesses}} around the tower had seen decreased patronage due to less foot traffic around the heavily secured area. Protests around the tower subsided after his inauguration in January 2017, and by summer 2017, the security measures around the tower had been loosened somewhat, owing to the fact that most security measures were implemented only when Trump was <b>actually</b> <b>in</b> the tower. However, several businesses at the tower's base had closed by then because of a {{reduction in the number of}} customers.|$|E
30|$|Regarding {{the means}} of the {{perceived}} distances, we first noticed that for every study site the perceived distances are higher than the objective ones. In Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, every respondent lived in areas exposed to coastal flooding according to the hazards maps but they perceived living on average at 980  m from areas exposed to coastal flooding. Respondents in Barneville-Carteret perceived living on average at 245  m from exposed areas, that being 2.6 times more than the average objective distance. 27.2 % of the respondents (25 individuals) who <b>actually</b> lived <b>in</b> exposed areas (according to experts’ hazard maps) estimated that they lived in exposed areas. 9.8 % of the respondents (9 individuals) who didn’t <b>actually</b> live <b>in</b> exposed areas estimated that they didn’t live in exposed areas. 9.8 % (9 individuals) who didn’t <b>actually</b> live <b>in</b> exposed areas estimated that they lived in exposed areas. In Saintes-Maries-de-la-mer 34.2 % (25 individuals) who <b>actually</b> lived <b>in</b> exposed areas estimated that they lived in exposed areas. 65.8 % (48 individuals) who <b>actually</b> lived <b>in</b> exposed areas estimated that they didn’t live in exposed areas. In Châtelaillon-Plage respondents perceived to live on average 19.5 times more than the average objective distances. 11.1 % (8 individuals) who <b>actually</b> lived <b>in</b> exposed areas estimated that they lived in exposed areas. 54.2 % (39 individuals) who <b>actually</b> lived <b>in</b> exposed areas estimated that they didn’t live in exposed areas. 2.7 % (2 individuals) who didn’t <b>actually</b> live <b>in</b> exposed areas estimated that they lived in exposed areas. At least, respondents from Sainte-Anne who perceived to live on average 1.6 times more than the average objective distances. 7.6 % (5 individuals) who <b>actually</b> lived <b>in</b> exposed areas estimated that they lived in exposed areas. 1.5 % (1 individual) who <b>actually</b> lived <b>in</b> an exposed area estimated that he or she didn’t live in an exposed area. 12.1 % (8 individuals) who didn’t <b>actually</b> live <b>in</b> exposed areas estimated that they lived in exposed areas.|$|R

5|$|Despite several counterattacks {{during the}} afternoon, the New Zealanders {{managed to hold}} their front line, {{including}} the village of Flers, although both flanks remained exposed due {{to the failure of}} 41st and 47th Divisions to reach or hold their frontage of the Blue Line. It was a successful day for the division; it had captured the most ground of all the divisions of XV Corps involved in the battle. It had also reached all four of its objectives although it ended the day in possession of three plus Flers itself, which was <b>actually</b> <b>in</b> 41st Division's sector.|$|E
5|$|In Oosterbeek, the {{situation}} was becoming more desperate. Hackett {{was wounded in the}} morning and had to give up the eastern command. The RAF attempted some close support around the perimeter which just held, but shelling and sniping increased casualties by the hour. The aid stations were home to some 2,000 men, both British and German as well as Dutch civilian casualties. Because many of them were <b>actually</b> <b>in</b> the front line in homes taken over earlier in the battle, the odd situation was created where casualties were evacuated forward rather than rearwards. Without evacuation, the wounded were often injured again and some posts changed hands between the British and Germans several times as the perimeter was fought over.|$|E
5|$|In the 5-planet {{solution}} for the 55 Cancri system, the orbit of 55 Cancri c is mildly eccentric: at apoastron the planet is about 19% further from the star than it is at periastron. It is located closer to 55 Cancri A than Mercury is to our sun, though it has a longer orbital period than the hot Jupiters. The planet is located close to a 3:1 resonance with the inner planet 55 Cancri b; however, simulations indicate that the two planets are not <b>actually</b> <b>in</b> this resonance.|$|E

5|$|The west door, <b>actually</b> <b>in</b> {{the south}} side of the church, is an elegant ornamented Decorated Gothic pointed arch, {{traditionally}} said to have come from Strata Florida Abbey. Whether it actually came from the Abbey is uncertain. A more probable date is thirteenth century, given its syle. Strata Florida Abbey was founded in 1164 and was consecrated in 1201. The arch is exceptionally ornate, indeed the finest such work in the county. It has three deeply moulded shafts each triple-roll with keel to centre roll and stiff-leaf capitals and matching triple mouldings to the pointed arch, with hoodmould. There is no evidence, archaeological or documentary, that it came from Strata Florida, or indeed anywhere else.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, Jayanthi (Andrea Jeremiah) arrives in Kochi from Mumbai {{in search of}} her missing husband, Ramesh (Ashvin Mathew), an Indian Revenue Service officer who {{frequently}} disappeared from home for various reasons, but is now {{a suspect in the}} gold smuggling. Jayanthi arranged for a taxi to drive her to various locations in her quest to find Ramesh. The taxi driver Raju (Mohanlal) appears to have an interest of his own in the circumstances surrounding Ramesh's disappearance. At Jayanthi's bidding, Raju drives her to the home of her mother-in-law (KPAC Lalitha) where he cooks for them and interacts in such a way to earn their trust. Jayanthi then asks Raju to drive her to Kochi to the office of her friend, Chandrasekharan (Vijayaraghavan), assistant commissioner of police. Chandrasekharan promises Jayanthi he will investigate the disappearance of Ramesh. After leaving Chandrasekharan's office, Raju drives Jayanthi to see Chandrasekharan's wife, Advocate Rekha (Muthumany), who is also her friend. During their chat, Jayanthi receives a surprise phone call from Ramesh. He explains that he is in Kovalam for an official meeting but will return home the next day, and insists that Jayanthi return home as well. Chandrasekharan later informs Jayanthi that the phone number Ramesh called from was <b>actually</b> <b>in</b> Kochi, not Kovalam. It is also revealed that Sudheer, Ramesh's brother is involved in the smuggling operation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the first}} round of pit stops, Hamilton had a lead of nearly 20seconds over Massa, and fuelled longer than all the other drivers in the points-scoring {{positions}} when he pitted on lap18. Coming out of the pits, Hamilton made an error and was passed by Trulli. The two drivers then nearly collided at the hairpin, with Hamilton holding back {{for the rest of the}} lap waiting for Trulli to pit. Trulli's teammate Glock stayed out on the track longer than all of the other drivers except Barrichello and Piquet, meaning that when he pitted, he was <b>actually</b> <b>in</b> third position and rejoined the race in eighth. Hamilton regained the lead by lap22 after Massa, Kovalainen, Trulli and Räikkönen made their pit stops, and had in the region of an 11second lead over Massa at the half-way stage of the race. Behind the leaders, fourth-placed Kubica was beginning to catch Kovalainen in third, while Trulli, Räikkönen, Alonso and Vettel battled over the final four point-scoring places.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{had hoped}} {{to pursue a career}} in the British Army, but his mother vetoed an active {{military}} career. He had been gazetted colonel on 9 November 1858—to his disappointment, as he had wanted to earn his commission by examination. In September 1861, Edward was sent to Germany, supposedly to watch military manoeuvres, but <b>actually</b> <b>in</b> order to engineer a meeting between him and Princess Alexandra of Denmark, the eldest daughter of Prince Christian of Denmark and his wife Louise. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert had already decided that Edward and Alexandra should marry. They met at Speyer on 24 September under the auspices of his elder sister, Victoria, who had married the Crown Prince of Prussia in 1858. Edward's elder sister, acting upon instructions from their mother, had met Princess Alexandra at Strelitz in June; the young Danish princess made a very favourable impression. Edward and Alexandra were friendly from the start; the meeting went well for both sides, and marriage plans advanced.|$|E
5|$|M sends Bond to {{investigate}} Carver after he releases news {{articles about the}} crisis hours before MI6 had learned of it. Bond travels to Hamburg and seduces Carver's wife, Paris, who is also Bond's ex-girlfriend, to get information that would help him enter Carver's newspaper headquarters. He also knocks out three of Stamper's men and cuts Carver off the air while he is giving a speech during the inaugural broadcast of his satellite network. After Bond steals back the GPS encoder, Carver orders Paris and Bond killed. Paris is murdered by Carver's personal assassin Dr. Kaufman, but Bond kills Kaufman and escapes, protecting the encoder. Bond learns that the encoder had been tampered with, {{and goes to the}} South China Sea {{to investigate}} the wreck (which was <b>actually</b> <b>in</b> Vietnamese waters). He and Wai Lin, a Chinese agent on the same case, explore the sunken ship and discover one of its cruise missiles missing, but are captured by Stamper and taken to the CMGN tower in Saigon. They soon escape and decide to collaborate on the investigation.|$|E
5|$|Moves {{to connect}} the town to the UK's railway network gained pace in 1845, when the Act of Parliament for the {{construction}} of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway (MSJAR) was passed. The first train left Altrincham early on 20 July 1849, carrying 65passengers. The MSJAR had two stations in the town: Altrincham, on Stockport Road, and Bowdon– though not <b>actually</b> <b>in</b> Bowdon– on Lloyd Street/Railway Street. Both were replaced in 1881 by Altrincham & Bowdon railway station on Stamford New Road. The London and North Western Railway's station at Broadheath, on the town's northern edge, was opened in 1854, while a further connection was created on 12 May 1862 by the Cheshire Midland Railway (later the Cheshire Lines Committee), who opened their line from Altrincham to Knutsford.|$|E

5|$|R Coronae Australis is an {{irregular}} variable star ranging from magnitudes 9.7 to 13.9. Blue-white, {{it is of}} spectral type B5IIIpe. A very young star, it is still accumulating interstellar material. It is obscured by, and illuminates, the surrounding nebula, NGC 6729, which brightens and darkens with it. The nebula is often compared to a comet for its appearance in a telescope, as its length is five times its width. S Coronae Australis is a G-class dwarf in the same field as R and is a T Tauri star. Nearby, another young variable star, TY Coronae Australis, illuminates another nebula: reflection nebula NGC 6726–7. TY Coronae Australis ranges irregularly between magnitudes 8.7 and 12.4, and {{the brightness of the}} nebula varies with it. Blue-white, it is of spectral type B8e. The largest young stars in the region, R, S, T, TY and VV Coronae Australis, are all ejecting jets of material which cause surrounding dust and gas to coalesce and form Herbig–Haro objects, many of which have been identified nearby. Lying adjacent to the nebulosity is the globular cluster known as NGC 6723, which is <b>actually</b> <b>in</b> the neighbouring constellation of Sagittarius and is much much further away.|$|E
5|$|The North Vietnamese {{reacted to}} the {{political}} changes in Cambodia by sending Premier Phạm Văn Đồng to meet Sihanouk in China and recruit him into an alliance with the Khmer Rouge. Pol Pot was also contacted by the Vietnamese who now offered him whatever resources he wanted for his insurgency against the Cambodian government. Pol Pot and Sihanouk were <b>actually</b> <b>in</b> Beijing {{at the same time}} but the Vietnamese and Chinese leaders never informed Sihanouk of the presence of Pol Pot or allowed the two men to meet. Shortly after, Sihanouk issued an appeal by radio to the people of Cambodia to rise up against the government and support the Khmer Rouge. In doing so, Sihanouk lent his name and popularity in the rural areas of Cambodia to a movement over which he had little control. In May 1970, Pol Pot finally returned to Cambodia and the pace of the insurgency greatly increased. After Sihanouk showed his support for the Khmer Rouge by visiting them in the field, their ranks swelled from 6,000 to 50,000 fighters.|$|E
5|$|The Palladian, Serlian, or Venetian window {{features}} {{largely in}} Palladio's work and {{is almost a}} trademark of his early career. It consists of a central light with semicircular arch over, carried on an impost consisting of a small entablature, under which, and enclosing two other lights, one on each side, are pilasters. In the library at Venice, Sansovino varied the design by substituting columns for the two inner pilasters. To describe its origin as being either Palladian or Venetian is not accurate; the motif was first used by Donato Bramante and later mentioned by Sebastiano Serlio (1475–1554) in his seven-volume architectural book Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetiva expounding the ideals of Vitruvius and Roman architecture, this arched window is flanked by two lower rectangular openings, a motif that {{first appeared in the}} triumphal arches of ancient Rome. Palladio used the motif extensively, most notably in the arcades of the Basilica Palladiana in Vicenza. It is also a feature of his entrances to both Villa Godi and Villa Forni Cerato. It is perhaps this extensive use of the motif in the Veneto that has given the window its alternative name of the Venetian window; it is also known as a Serlian window. Whatever the name or the origin, this form of window has probably {{become one of the most}} enduring features of Palladio's work seen in the later architectural styles evolved from Palladianism. According to James Lees-Milne, its first appearance in Britain was in the remodelled wings of Burlington House, London, where the immediate source was <b>actually</b> <b>in</b> Inigo Jones's designs for Whitehall Palace rather than drawn from Palladio himself.|$|E
