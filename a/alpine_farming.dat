40|$|In {{the present}} work, a rapid and simple NMR method to {{discriminate}} Asiago d’Allevo cheese samples from different production chains is described. A fast and reproducible extraction {{of the organic}} fraction was employed. By applying chemometric analysis to NMR data, {{it is possible to}} differentiate PDO Asiago cheese produced in <b>alpine</b> <b>farms</b> from that produced in lowland and mountain industrialized factories. PCA of both 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra showed a good separation of <b>alpine</b> <b>farm</b> products from the other ones, whereas the lowland and mountain industrialized cheeses are undistinguishable. The samples were differentiated {{on the basis of a}} higher content of unsaturated fatty acids, principally oleic, linoleic, linolenic, and conjugated linoleic acids for the <b>alpine</b> <b>farm</b> cheeses and a higher content of saturated fatty acids for the industrialized products. Conjugated linoleic acid and 1 -pentene are also discriminating components...|$|R

40|$|The <b>alpine</b> dairy <b>farming</b> {{settlements}} or <b>alpine</b> dairy <b>farms</b> {{represent an}} important part of the settlement structure characteristic mainly for Slovenian mountains. With their archaic image the <b>alpine</b> dairy <b>farms</b> offer an insight into the distant past and are as such an important source of information about the first settlements on our territory. In the past years a number of <b>alpine</b> dairy <b>farms</b> has undergone a transformation into permanent settlements or holiday resorts, some are even falling apart and are therefore losing their historical value. Using the examples of 15 <b>alpine</b> dairy <b>farming</b> settlements from Julian and Kamnik Alps this dissertation analyses the major factors that have impacted the choice of location for the farming settlements, their spatial arrangement, the building typology, the arrangement of accesses and connections inside each settlement, and their connections with pastures. By analysing each settlement, the dissertation researches to what degree the arrangement of the <b>alpine</b> dairy <b>farming</b> settlements has been impacted not only by natural resources and ecological factors but also by social factors; it also tries to define the boundaries between the functionality and the planned forming of such settlements. Using the data acquired with the analyses and the research of local literature and current legislation the dissertation also presents suggestions for further regulations of <b>alpine</b> dairy <b>farms...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The valleys were {{populated}} by the so-called Walsers - a name which {{is found in}} many Tyrolean family names. Historically, <b>alpine</b> <b>farming</b> dominates and is known today under the term alpine transhumance, a 3-phase lifestyle that highly influenced culture, traditions and architecture.|$|E
50|$|The {{municipality}} {{is located}} in the Olten district, along a stream at the southern foot of the Jura Mountains. It consists of the village of Hägendorf, scattered settlements on Vogelberg and Eggberg and individual <b>alpine</b> <b>farms</b> in the Jura Mountains, including the buildings and clinic at Allerheiligenberg farm.|$|R
50|$|The {{cheese is}} made {{exclusively}} from recognized <b>Alpine</b> <b>farms</b> during the <b>Alpine</b> season. Only milk from cows fed on pastures {{which have not}} been fertilised artificially may be used. The milk is highly flavoured from the Alpine herbs and is much richer in polyunsaturated fatty-acids than milk from the lowland regions.|$|R
50|$|Several <b>Alpine</b> <b>farms</b> {{surround}} the structured village centre, with 492 inhabitants in total. Because {{of the lack}} of local undertakings, {{a large proportion of the}} working population commute daily. A major employer since 1907 is the RHI refractory company in 13 km away place Radenthein. Parts of the Magnesite occurrence on Millstätter Alpe belong to the area of Obermillstatt.|$|R
50|$|Primarily an <b>alpine</b> <b>farming</b> community, {{the village}} {{began to be}} visited by {{tourists}} in the early 19th century, when Felix Mendelssohn, followed in the 1817 publication of Mary and Percy Bysshe Shelley's History of a Six Weeks' Tour and Byron's Manfred, in which the scenery of the area is described. This became {{the advent of the}} modern tourism industry for the village.|$|E

50|$|The {{municipality}} {{suffered from}} frequent natural disasters, {{especially from the}} floods of the Dranse in 1469, 1595 and a particularly devastating flood in 1818. There were silver mines in the area between 1344-1723 and again in 1852-55. In 1958 the Lac de Mauvoisin Dam was built. The dam along with increasing tourism in the mid-20th Century changed {{the character of the}} villages dramatically. The village economies changed from <b>alpine</b> <b>farming</b> to domination by the services sector.|$|E
50|$|In {{keeping with}} the base {{meaning of the word}} ("rock spikes"), schrofen also forms part of the name of {{numerous}} mountains in the Northern Limestone Alps. <b>Alpine</b> <b>farms</b> near a schrofen are often named after it, as are their access roads, e.g.: Ob dm Schrofa, Schrofaweg. The word is linked to the German adjective schroff which means rugged, steep or craggy.|$|R
40|$|A {{near-infrared}} spectroscopy (NIRS) {{application was}} developed to discriminate Asiago d'Allevo, cheese coming from different production chains (<b>alpine</b> <b>farms,</b> mountain and lowland factories). One hundred wheels were collected in different seasons from all productive sites of Asiago d'Allevo: 14 <b>alpine</b> <b>farms</b> and 8 mountain and 13 lowland factories. Samples were analyzed for chemical composition and color and scanned by NIRS (1100 - 2500 nm). A factorial discriminant analysis based on chemical and color data showed a clear separation between alpine and factory products due to their different fatty acids profile and color. However, cheeses from lowland and mountain factories were undistinguishable. A discriminant analysis using NIRS spectra alone or combined with chemical and color data showed similar results. A final calibration based on NIRS spectra was developed and validated {{by a set of}} 7 external samples to discriminate alpine from factory products. This real-time analysis is a reliable alternative to expensive and time-consuming lab determinations...|$|R
50|$|Annandale, {{also known}} as <b>Alpine</b> <b>Farms,</b> is a {{historic}} home located at Gilmore Mills, Botetourt County, Virginia. It was built in 1835, and is a two-story, Greek Revival-style brick dwelling with a deck-on-hip roof. It has a one-story, three bay, wooden front porch with tapering square coiumns. A two-story brick west wing and a single story frame ell, were added in 1969. Also on the property is a contributing brick dairy or meathouse.|$|R
50|$|Until the 19th century, <b>alpine</b> <b>farming</b> and herding was {{the primary}} source of income. A mill was built on the Diesbach river in 1778. Today it is a guest house for the rectory. A parish school opened in 1727. A {{secondary}} school opened in 1844. A spinning mill opened in 1843 and a warehouse was added in 1910; it is now a textile chemical factory. A station of the Schweizerische Nordostbahn (Swiss North-East Railway) opened in the village in 1879.|$|E
50|$|The villagers {{earned their}} living from agriculture, mostly through {{traditional}} <b>alpine</b> <b>farming</b> and herding. During {{construction of the}} Ceneri tunnel in 1872-82, the population increased sharply. The completion of the road in 1811 {{and the construction of}} the tunnel and the station led to {{the emergence of a new}} district in the flatter part of the valley. This area forms the northern boundary of the agglomeration of Lugano. The base station of the Monte Tamaro gondola opened in 1972 in Rivera.|$|E
50|$|In 1991 a mummy of a neolithic body, {{known as}} Ötzi the Iceman, was {{discovered}} by hikers on the Similaun glacier. His clothing and gear indicate that he lived in an <b>alpine</b> <b>farming</b> community, while the location and manner of his death - an arrowhead was discovered in his shoulder - suggests he was travelling {{from one place to}} another. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of Ötzi, has shown that he belongs to the K1 subclade which cannot be categorized into any of the three modern branches of that subclade. The new subclade has provisionally been named K1ö for Ötzi.|$|E

5000|$|On 5 September, a Saturday and {{the last}} day of the summer term, Giovanni went {{directly}} to the out of town family home at Tirano after school. A few days later there was a visit from Cesare Correnti and the patriot doctor, [...] who briefed him on the disturbances in the city at the end of the previous week. Together they discussed a way ahead. In this way, Giovanni, who was still a teenager, went with the others to the village of Stelvio where they were able to update the <b>alpine</b> <b>farming</b> community on the situation, and where it is known that Giovanni took time out to scrawl on a wall [...] "Viva l'Italia, viva Pio IX" [...] ("Long live united Italy, long live Pius IX").|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally {{the villagers}} of Sigriswil fished in Lake Thun, raised crops and {{vineyards}} on {{the valley floor}} and raised cattle in the summer in high alpine meadows before bringing them down for winter. By 1914 a combination of disease, competition from imported wine and the looming World War destroyed the wine industry in the municipality. During the late 19th and early 20th century steam boats and improved roads began bringing tourists to the municipality. Hotels and restaurants opened along the lake shore and on the slopes. The first class hotels settled along the lake shore, while small chalets and vacation homes developed in the mountain valleys and terraces. [...] Today, Sigriswil is a tranquil <b>alpine</b> <b>farming</b> village {{as well as a}} popular tourist resort.|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{consumers}} have markedly increased {{their attention to}} the quality of foods, as a results of an amplified requirement of safety in all agricultural products, including those of animal origin. As a consequence, there has been a growing interest for the so called functional foods, for foods from the organic agriculture and for the DOP (Protected Origin Denomination) brand products. Fontina cheese is one of the Italian cheeses qualified as DOP, and it is produced exclusively in Valle d’Aosta with raw and whole milk from Valdostana cows. During the summer the cheese is directly manufactured in <b>Alpine</b> <b>farms</b> located in different valleys, and where cows are grazed and moved progressively to higher altitudes [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{village is}} {{mentioned}} {{for the first}} time in 1284 as [...] "Gasnitz". In 1288 the valley had nine Schwaighöfe (<b>alpine</b> <b>farms)</b> seven of them in Gschnitz, which formed the centre of the village, and two at Laponesalm. The right of succession in Tirol originated from these nine Schwaighöfe and was adopted in all the other valleys in the region. In 1471 the rivalry between Gschnitz and Trins arose and reached a point that the inhabitants of the two villages blocked the entrance to the valley; the Steinach am Brenner Court had to intervene to resolve the dispute. Gschnitz was awarded the status of a municipality in 1811. Major development occurred from the 18th century onwards.|$|R
50|$|The {{clearing}} {{of forests}} in the surroundings of mountain huts created species-rich mountain meadows, which were maintained in <b>alpine</b> pasture <b>farming.</b> After the population exchange in 1945, this type of management largely came to a standstill and the mountain meadows were largely abandoned.|$|R
50|$|The remote valley {{was settled}} by Bavarian peasants in the 9th century; field {{names in the}} highest-lying {{southern}} parts also denote a Carantanian (Slavic) colonization. Gastein is first mentioned as Gastuna in a 963 deed, when the area belonged to the German stem duchy of Bavaria. It was originally an <b>alpine</b> <b>farming</b> and gold mining area and {{the site of an}} ancient trade route crossing the main ridge of the Central Eastern Alps. In 1297 Duke Otto III and his brother Stephen I, both highly indebted, sold it to the Prince-Archbishops of Salzburg. Already about 1230, the minnesinger Neidhart von Reuental had referred to the hot springs in his Middle High German poem Die Graserin in der Gastein; the spas were visited by the Habsburg emperor Frederick III {{as well as by the}} Renaissance physician Paracelsus.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most popular}} {{cultural}} {{activity in the}} town is called the [...] "Kufenstechen", which is a customary church parish festival among the <b>Alpine</b> <b>farming</b> community. This annual event, held on Whit Monday, is celebrated {{in the month of}} May and marks the participation of unmarried men riding bareback on Noriker horses, wearing traditional costumes. The event involves horse riders striking a wooden barrel with an iron club till the last wooden splinter is felled; this involves several rounds of horse riding around the barrel till it is broken fully. The winner is given a flower wreath, which he wears on his wrist. This festival is said to be observed since 1630 AD. After the horse ride, a traditional dance festival is held under a lime tree (called the [...] "Linde Dance") with the winner of the horse event getting the first dance. Unmarried girls participate in the dance dressed in traditional [...] "Gailtaler" [...] costumes. The dance is accompanied by traditional songs, some in Slovenian.|$|E
5000|$|While the {{inhabitants}} of the Alps had practised transhumance for thousands of years, during the Late Middle Ages it became increasingly important as the population decreased following the Black Death and the wars of this era. [...] Cattle production was much less manpower-intensive than farming, which was ideal with the reduced population. However, cattle production is much more capital- and especially land-intensive. Cattle production became an investment opportunity for monasteries and citizens of nearby cities. The investors would purchase the cattle and then rent the beasts out to small farmers or to herders for the summer. The smaller alpine communities generally did not want [...] "foreign" [...] cattle pastured in their alpine pastures, which led to conflicts between the <b>alpine</b> <b>farming</b> communities and the neighboring cities and monasteries. [...] Conflicts over grazing rights and ownership of the alpine meadows led to several wars within what is now Switzerland, including the pivotal Battle of Morgarten (1315), which started due to a long-simmering feud between Schwyz and Einsiedeln Abbey.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare Montasio cheese made from milk of 120 Italian Simmental cows reared under two {{different}} systems. On an <b>alpine</b> <b>farm,</b> 60 cows were maintained on Gramineae-rich pasture and supplemented with 2 kg head day(- 1) of concentrate on average. The other 60 cows were kept indoors and fed a hay-based diet. Cheese production was repeated in two periods (early July and late August) and processed for each period for 3 consecutive days according to traditional production technology of PDO Montasio. Analyses of chemical, textural and fatty acids were performed on two-month-ripened cheeses. Pasture-derived cheese was significantly different from hay-derived cheese in terms of chemical composition (higher dry matter and fat, lower protein), colour (more yellow-red) and textural properties (higher hardness, gumminess and chewiness). In addition, it showed a fatty acids profile more beneficial for human healt...|$|R
