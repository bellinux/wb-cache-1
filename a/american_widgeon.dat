25|$|Birdwatching author William J. Boyle {{reports that}} Swartswood {{is home to}} a {{surprising}} number of waterfowl species, including pied-billed grebe, wood duck, ring-necked duck, ruddy duck, <b>American</b> <b>widgeon,</b> gadwall, American coot and occasionally bald eagle.|$|E
50|$|Although mallards, {{northern}} pintails, {{and wood}} ducks {{are the most}} numerous waterfowl species on the refuge, blue- and green-winged teal, northern shovelers, gadwall, and <b>American</b> <b>Widgeon</b> are also common. Primary diving ducks are scaup and ring-necked ducks. Canada, snow, and greater white-fronted geese are present, though less common.|$|E
50|$|The Alaksen National Wildlife Area {{provides}} a valuable wildlife area {{very close to}} the urban centre of Metro Vancouver, allowing many educational opportunities. The cropland frequently floods in the winter and occasionally freezes over for short periods. Varied seasonal management practices provide valuable habitat to wintering waterfowl & other species of wildlife. Over forty species of waterfowl winter in the area, the most common being Canada goose, mallard, <b>American</b> <b>widgeon,</b> and lesser snow goose. Also abundant are raptors, including bald eagle, barn owl, and several species of falcon.|$|E
25|$|Notable birds include <b>American</b> <b>widgeons,</b> mallard ducks, {{great blue}} herons, bald eagles, golden eagles, western meadowlarks (the state bird), barn owls, great horned owls, rufous hummingbirds, pileated woodpeckers, wrens, towhees, sparrows, and buntings.|$|R
40|$|The North Gulf Coast - Prince William Sound {{region of}} Alaska, phytographically, {{lies at the}} {{northern}} limit of the Sitka Spruce-hemlock coastal/subalpine forests of the Pacific Coast; it includes approximately 178, 500 km 2 and a shoreline of approximately 8, 500 km. Fourteen habitats are utilized by birds: tundra; shrub thickets; hemlock-Sitka Spruce forests; bogs; mixed deciduous-spruce woodlands; marshes; lacustrine waters; fluviatile waters; cliffs, bluffs, and screes; moraines, alluvia, and barrier islands; beaches and tidal flats; rocky shores and reefs; inshore waters; and offshore waters. Two hundred nineteen species of birds have been recorded in the region, 111 of which are primarily water-related. Status, abundance, habitat, and seasonal occurrence {{are discussed in the}} annotated list of species. The geographic location and restrictive topography of the region make it a spectacular corridor for millions of migrating birds. In spring millions of Pintails, Dunlins, Western Sandpipers, and Northern Phalaropes move through the region, as do tens of thousands of Whistling Swans, Snow Geese, Knots, and Sanderlings. Fall concentrations of White-fronted Geese and Sandhill Cranes may exceed 100, 000 's. Species with notably large summering populations include Trumpeter Swans (several hundred breeding pairs), Bald Eagles (1, 800 - 2, 000 breeding pairs), Aleutian Terns (150 - 250 breeding pairs on Copper River Delta), Marbled Murrelets (probably millions), and Kittlitz's Murrelets (probably a few 100, 000 's). Significant range extensions reported include Yellow-billed Loons (fairly common in winter), Pink-footed and Pale-footed shearwaters, Brandt's Cormorants (breeding), Red-faced Cormorants (breeding), Steller's Eiders (winter), Bristle-thighed Curlews (migrant), Bar-tailed Godwits (migrant), Crested Auklets (winter), and northernmost wintering populations of waterfowl (Canada Geese, Gadwalls, Pintails, Green-winged Teals, <b>American</b> <b>Widgeons)</b> and shorebirds (Surfbirds, Black Trunstones, Dunlins, and Sanderlings). Some unexpected species reported include Skua, Anna's Hummingbird, Purple Marin, Yellowthroat, Common Grackle, and White-throated Sparrow...|$|R
40|$|Avian {{influenza}} viruses (AIVs) pose {{a significant}} threat to public health, and viral subtypes circulating in natural avian reservoirs {{can contribute to}} the emergence of pathogenic influenza viruses in humans. We investigated the prevalence and distribution of AIVs in 8826 migratory and resident wild birds in North America along the Pacific flyway, which is a major north–south migration pathway that overlaps with four other flyways in Alaska providing opportunities for mixing of Eurasian and American origin influenza viruses. Overall, the prevalence of AIVs was low (1 %) among the wide range of avian species tested, but we detected AIVs in 69 hunter-harvested waterfowl (Anseriformes) sampled at a national wildlife refuge in California from October 2007 to January 2008. A wide range of subtypes were detected in waterfowl with H 6 N 1, H 10 N 7, H 7 N 3, and H 3 N 5 being the most common. We suspect H 6 N 1 was introduced or remerged in 2007 at this key wintering site for waterfowl along the Pacific Flyway. Over a 3 -week period, 13 H 6 N 1 AIVs were isolated from two northern pintails (Anas acuta), three northern shovelers (Anas clypeata), three ring-necked ducks (Aythya collaris), four <b>American</b> <b>widgeon</b> (Anas americana), and one gadwall (Anas strepera). We conclude that a diverse array of AIVs was present and that cross-species transmission was occurring among waterfowl in the central valley wetlands of California...|$|E
40|$|SINCE HIS {{days as a}} boy on the North Dakota prairies, Paul A. Johnsgard has 2 ̆ 2 {{measured}} his winters, not {{by conventional}} time units, but in the days it took for the snow geese to return from their wintering grounds [...] 2 ̆ 2 The author of five books: Song of the North Wind-A Story of the Snow Goose; Grouse and Quails of North America; Waterfowl- Their Biology and Natural History; Animal Behavior; and Handbook of Waterfowl Behavior, and of numerous articles in national magazines and over 40 technical papers, he is eminently qualified to capture in pen and ink {{the very essence of}} Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s wildfowl. The line art on the following pages are {{but a few of the}} illustrations to be found in his forthcoming book, Waterfowl of North America. Dr. Johnsgard received his Ph. D from Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y., and a postdoctoral fellowship with Bristol University and the Wildfowl Trust, England. Currently he is Professor of Zoology in the School of Life Sciences at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, a position he has held since 1961. His teaching responsibilities include ecology, animal behavior and ornithology. His life-long love for wildfowl is best described in his own words when speaking of his early years on the prairie-pothole country of North Dakota: 2 ̆ 2 The annual spring ritual of meeting the geese on their return from the south was more important to me than the opening day of hunting season, the beginning of summer vacation or even the arrival of Christmas. The spring return of the geese represented my epiphany-a manifestation of gods I could see, hear, and nearly touch as they streamed into the marsh a few feet above the tips of the cattails and phragmites [...] .. During the drive home my ears would resound with the cries of the wild geese and, when I closed my eyes that night, I saw them still, their strong wings flashing in the sunlight, their immaculate bodies projected against the azure sky. 2 ̆ 2 Portraits include: snow goose, pintail, Ross goose, canvasback, <b>American</b> <b>widgeon,</b> common goldeneye, green-winged teal, wood duc...|$|E
40|$|The Saskatchewan River Delta (SRD) {{in central}} Canada, North America’s largest inland delta, is an {{important}} spring and fall stopover site for waterfowl with thousands flocking there annually to stage. However {{there is very little}} information on their origins prior to arrival and their feeding ecology while in the Delta. To date, band recoveries are largely from birds banded south of the SRD, mostly due to limited banding activity in productive waterfowl habitats to the north such as the Peace-Athabasca Delta and the broader boreal forest. There is also very little information on the importance of the SRD as an overall recruitment area for the North American waterfowl population. No studies have used stable isotopes to infer the origins and diets of these birds. I first used stable isotopes of hydrogen ( 2 H) and sulfur ( 34 S) to infer migratory origins and specifically evaluate the contribution of local and non-local birds to the staging population in the SRD during fall migration. Based on  2 H, I found that few birds (34 %) originated in the SRD despite its known role as breeding habitat; instead, most birds (56 %) were migrants from the north of the SRD and a small fraction (10 %) came from south of the SRD. Stable sulfur isotope data proved a useful tool in further delineation of birds into prairie and forest regions, respectively. Secondly, I used stable carbon ( 13 C) and nitrogen ( 15 N) isotopes and mercury concentrations in liver tissue ([Hg]) to trace nutrient sources of these waterfowl using the SRD prior to fall migration, and tested for differences in diets among species, sexes and age groups within species. I demonstrated the importance of macrophytes as a source of food, particularly among the <b>American</b> <b>Widgeon</b> and Northern Pintail (70 % of the diet). However, there was some level of partitioning of resources at the species level, as Blue-winged Teal and Green-winged Teal used invertebrate sources, as did a distinct group of Mallards. This is likely a result of birds minimizing competition for resources during the short staging period in the SRD when waterfowl densities are high. Finally, I found that  15 N values in liver, a known indicator of trophic position, can be confounded by variation in basal sources; hence, there is the need to use other isotopes or tracers such as [Hg] for verification. Overall, my results suggest an important role for northern ecosystems in central Canada in contributing to the waterfowl breeding population in the Central Flyway, and a key role for the SRD in providing fuel for waterfowl during fall migration. ...|$|E
