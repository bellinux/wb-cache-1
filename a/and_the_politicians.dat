5|$|Although the U.S. {{command in}} Saigon <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> in Washington became {{increasingly}} {{aware of this}} arrangement during 19661967, they declined to overtly interfere due to the political ramifications of conducting military operations against a neutral country and the wishes of Sihanouk. Washington still had hopes of reopening a dialog with Sihanouk, and refrained from any actions that might alienate him further.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{municipal}} council was considering {{the future of}} the airport. The city engineer estimated it would need a subsidy of NOK2 million in 2006, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>politicians,</b> who wanted the airport to run without subsidies, demanded that Vildanden guarantee for the deficit. This was rejected by Vildanden—on the contrary, the company was in dire need for more capital, and issued a private placement for NOK4 million in December 2005. The company had since the start been losing money, and needed extra capital to get through the rough until it could make an operating profit. After the placement, 15% of the company was owned by DAT, while Coast Air sold their shares. In 2005, Vildanden had a revenue of NOK15 million.|$|E

5|$|Dissatisfaction {{became more}} evident during the 1880s, and some {{officers}} began to display open insubordination. The Emperor <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> {{did nothing to}} improve the military nor meet their demands. The dissemination of Positivist ideology among young officers brought further complications, as Positivism opposed the monarchy under the belief that a dictatorial republic would bring improvements. A coalition between a mutinous Army faction and the Positivist camp was formed and directly led to the republican coup on 15 November 1889. Battalions and even full regiments of soldiers loyal to the Empire, who shared {{the ideals of the}} older generation of leaders, attempted to restore the monarchy. Attempts at a restoration proved futile and supporters of the Empire were executed, arrested or forcibly retired.|$|E
5|$|The American {{command in}} Saigon <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> in Washington {{were opposed to}} a wet season Hmong offensive, {{supporting}} instead a holding action {{on the edge of}} the Plain of Jars as a prelude to a possible cease-fire. Washington also insisted that U.S. airpower be used to interdict PAVN supply lines, not as close air support for ground operations. Vang Pao took up the offensive anyway, but his forces could only occupy half of the Plain before his offensive sputtered out at the end of July.|$|E
5|$|The {{city council}} voted {{in favour of}} {{building}} the Ring Line on 25 June 1997, against the votes of the Progress Party. However, the decision did not include how the line would be financed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> stated that they were hoping that the state would use national road funds to finance the project. This was partially ensured in December, when a political agreement was reached for Oslo Package 2, a financing plan for investments in public transport in Oslo and Akershus between 2002 and 2011.|$|E

5|$|A weary Emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, an {{increasingly}} discontented ruling class who were dismissive of the Imperial role in national affairs: all these factors presaged the monarchy's impending doom. The means to achieve the overthrow of the Imperial system would soon appear within the Army ranks. Republicanism had never flourished in Brazil outside of certain elitist circles, and had little support in the provinces. A growing combination of republican and Positivist ideals among the army's junior and mid-level officer ranks, however, began to form a serious threat to the monarchy. These officers favored a republican dictatorship, which they believed would be superior to the liberal democratic monarchy. Beginning with small acts of insubordination {{at the beginning of the}} 1880s, discontent in the army grew in scope and audacity during the decade, as the Emperor was uninterested <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> proved incapable of re-establishing the government's authority over the military.|$|E

Questions have also been raised about federal aid given to Swissair <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> involved. The highly competitive nature of the market during the business's final years also precipitated its demise: like rival company Sabena, Swissair fell victim to the competition of budget airlines such as Ryanair and EasyJet.|$|E

25|$|That same day, the Spanish left-wing {{political}} party Podemos organised a political {{gathering in the}} city of Zaragoza, where members of several regions met with Pablo Iglesias. The mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, asked for a solution to the tension through dialogue. During the gathering, 500 far-right Spanish nationalists protested outside the building and blocked the exits. The police could not intervene because most of the police in Zaragoza was deployed in Catalonia <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> were isolated during a few hours. During this protests the president of the Aragonese Corts, Violeta Barba, was injured by the impact of a filled plastic bottle.|$|E
25|$|There were no cartels at {{that time}} in Mexico. Félix Gallardo was the lord of Mexican drug smugglers. He oversaw all operations; there was just him, his cronies, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>politicians</b> who sold him protection. However, the Guadalajara Cartel {{suffered}} a major blow in 1985 when the group's co-founder Rafael Caro Quintero was captured, and later convicted, for the murder of DEA agent Enrique Camarena. Félix Gallardo afterwards kept a low profile and in 1987 he moved with his family to Guadalajara. According to Peter Dale Scott, the Guadalajara Cartel prospered largely because it enjoyed the protection of the Dirección Federal de Seguridad (DFS), under its chief Miguel Nazar Haro.|$|E

During 2006, the ridership increased, and Vildanden started becoming more aggressive against Widerøe, which was flying to Bergen from Sandefjord Airport. Vildanden stated that they aimed to outperform Widerøe on price to Bergen. The operations were taken over by Avitrans in October 2006. This included a second aircraft, allowing the airline to start operations to Stavanger and Molde Airport, Årø in 2007. From 18 March, Vildanden also started three weekly departures from Skien to Stockholm-Skavsta Airport. The route was necessary to transport personnel from Avitrans' hub at Bromma to Skien.|$|E

Those in jail would be released on bond or their own recognizance.
