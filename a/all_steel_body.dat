5000|$|Coupé 1600 HF (Tipo 818.740/741): 1970. Face-lifted <b>all</b> <b>steel</b> <b>body</b> with 1,584 cc engine with Solex C42DDHF carb {{producing}} [...] at 6,000 rpm. The bodywork {{was changed}} from the standard 1.3 Coupé to incorporate flared wheel arches (replacing the extensions used on 1st series HFs).|$|E
50|$|The Magic Iris is {{made using}} an <b>all</b> <b>steel</b> <b>body</b> and frame - {{reinforced}} by reverse hat section chassis rails and beams, welded under its floor.The vehicle features all-around independent suspension {{with coil springs}} - MacPherson struts in the front, and semi-trailing arms in the rear.|$|E
50|$|The Morris Light Six was {{the first}} car to use the <b>all</b> <b>steel</b> <b>body</b> made by Pressed Steel at Cowley but on the road it proved too {{unstable}} to enter full production. Revised and given a wider track and longer wheelbase it was named Morris Six.|$|E
5000|$|Production of {{the vehicle}} was {{suspended}} for 1927. When the Durant was reintroduced April 1928, the car was redesigned and powered by a six cylinder Continental engine; {{some of the early}} vehicles were marketed as the [...] "Durant-Star". Bodies for the vehicle were supplied by Budd Company. In 1930, some Durants were built with <b>all</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bodies,</b> also supplied by Budd.|$|R
2500|$|With a short wheelbase, {{mid-mounted}} winch, {{and short}} overhang, the body {{could only be}} [...] feet long. Both sides had sideboards with fold down troop seats and bows for a tarpaulin. Two spare tires were mounted inside the body, one along each side. Early models had <b>all</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bodies,</b> in 1942 they were replaced by largely wood types to conserve <b>steel.</b> <b>All</b> Corbitts (3,077) were prime movers, White also built 3,547.|$|R
50|$|The first Buick Estate {{station wagon}} was a large-bodied GM C {{platform}} Super modified {{with a wooden}} body, shared with the Oldsmobile Series 60. In 1941 and 1942 it was available on Buick's B platform Special series, and later on Buick's C platform (Roadmaster and Super) in the 1946-53 model years. From 1954 to 1958 it was only offered on the smaller B platform Century and Special, with <b>all</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bodies.</b> Among these were hardtop Estate Wagons called Caballero that were offered only in 1957 and 1958.|$|R
50|$|The small DKWs {{were among}} top selling small cars in Germany in the 1930s, and regular model updates {{were part of}} the company's {{strategy}} for maintaining commercial success in this growing market sector. With its <b>all</b> <b>steel</b> <b>body</b> designed by Guenther Mickwausch the F9 would have represented a significantly greater step forward than the F8 had done: it appears that the F9 was already under development in 1937, two years before launch of its F8 predecessor. Several prototypes were built during the 1939-1942 period.|$|E
5000|$|To meet post-war demand, {{particularly}} UK Government {{pressure to}} export and earn overseas currency, Rolls-Royce developed an <b>all</b> <b>steel</b> <b>body</b> using pressings made by Pressed Steel {{to create a}} [...] "standard" [...] ready-to-drive complete saloon car. The first steel-bodied model produced was the Bentley Mark VI: these started {{to emerge from the}} newly reconfigured Crewe factory early in 1946. [...] Some years later, initially only for export, the Rolls-Royce Silver Dawn was introduced, a standard steel Bentley but with a Rolls-Royce radiator grille for a small extra charge, and this convention continued.|$|E

2500|$|The basic cargo {{model was}} a prime mover used to tow the M114 155 mm {{howitzer}} and transport gun crews, equipment, and ammunition. They had a pintle hitch {{at the rear}} to tow up to [...] off-road and [...] on road. With a short wheelbase and rear overhang, the body could only be [...] feet long. It had sideboards with fold down troop seats and bows for an overhead tarpaulin. Two spare tires were mounted inside the body, across the front.

5000|$|In 1923, Citroën {{returned}} to United States, where {{this time he}} began a business relationship with American engineer Edward Gowen Budd. [...] From 1899, Budd had worked to develop stainless <b>steel</b> <b>bodies</b> for railroad cars, for the Pullman in particular. Budd went on to manufacture <b>steel</b> <b>bodies</b> for many automakers, Dodge being his first big auto client. In Europe the Citroën B10 was the first car to use an [...] "all-steel" [...] ("tout-acier") body. [...] Although individual flat sheets of steel were structurally weak and prone to deform under pressure, once a steel sheet was stamped into a three-dimensional shape it became much more rigid, and by welding {{a number of these}} three-dimensional sheets together it became possible to create a car body stronger than a traditional timber framed car body, but one that weighed much less, so that the cars that used <b>all</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bodies</b> could be powered by smaller cheaper engines, or else provide more speed and better fuel economy.|$|R
50|$|The Bullnose {{radiator}} {{was replaced}} by a more conventional flat radiator announced 11 September 1926 on new cars now with doors either side and a longer list of accessories supplied as standard. <b>All</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bodies</b> were coming available. The engines remained the same, but the Cowley unlike the Oxford, retained braking on the rear wheels only as standard, although a front brake system was available at extra cost (featured car has this fitted). The chassis was new and the suspension was updated with semi elliptic leaf springs all round plus Smiths friction type scissor shock absorbers. The brakes are rod and spring operated with cams inside the drums to actuate. Interesting to note that the rear brake drums include two sets of shoes, one of which is connected directly to the handbrake.|$|R

50|$|The {{big news}} for 1937 was an <b>all</b> new <b>steel</b> <b>body.</b> This {{put an end}} to {{concerns}} that had arisen since 1932 when the timber frame bodies had gained a reputation for distorting or even snapping as the manufacturer introduced modified bodies with successively lengthened wheel-bases. The new body, which DKW celebrated with a return to the DKW Sonderklasse name, was in fact shared with the Wanderer W24 from DKW’s fellow member of the Auto Union. In this form the Sonderklasse continued to be produced in useful volumes and without further significant changes until 1940.|$|R
50|$|The {{last of the}} Austin {{range to}} be given Dick Burzi's new body shape it was {{announced}} twelve months after the entry into production of Austin's update of their Sixteen into their stubby-nosed Eighteen, a 50% more powerful engine in a longer-nosed (by 18 inches) body. The new body which only shared its general appearance with the smaller Eighteen was described as notable for its roominess and luxurious comfort. Generous seating with a flat unobstructed floor together with draught-free ventilation by sliding quarter windows, sound insulation for <b>all</b> the <b>steel</b> <b>body</b> panels and generous luggage accommodation were further new features. Equipment includes a reversing light. The price of the new Twenty-Eight was £700.|$|R
50|$|There had {{therefore}} been various {{attempts to}} modify the GAZ-A using locally designed elements, but the body structures in question had used traditional timber frames with panels attached, which were labour-intensive to produce and excessively prone to deform. In the US car body construction was changing radically during the later 1920s, using technology pioneered by Ambi Budd, {{for the production of}} <b>all</b> <b>steel</b> car <b>bodies.</b> The new approach used far more complicated steel pressings than had hitherto been possible, and the same new techniques were adopted by the more prosperous of the volume auto-makers in the west of Europe through the 1930s. GAZ’s western technology partner, Ford, took a conservative approach to these developments, but during the early 1930s they, too, would join in the switch to all-steel car bodies.|$|R
50|$|Edward G Budd {{found another}} visionary in André Citroën and a {{result was the}} all-steel Citroën Type B10 {{introduced}} in October 1924. Dodge placed the <b>steel</b> <b>bodies</b> onto conventional chassis frames. Budd envisioned pushing his technology even further. By 1934, they had developed the Citroën Traction Avant, the first unibody, pressed-steel automobile. In order to hold <b>all</b> this <b>steel</b> together, Budd also pioneered the use of arc welding in automobile manufacturing.|$|R
5000|$|The Jaguar Mark V (pronounced mark five) {{and always}} printed in company {{documents}} as a Roman numeral V, never an Arabic number 5, is an automobile built by Jaguar Cars Ltd from 1948 to 1951. [...] The Mark V {{was introduced to}} distributors and the press on 30 September 1948 and launched on 27 October 1948 at the London Motor Show {{at the same time}} as the XK120, with which it shared a stand. The XK120 stole the show. However, the Mark V vastly outsold the XK120 by roughly 5,000 cars per year as compared to 2,000 cars per year for the XK120. While the XK120 had a new overhead-camshaft XK engine, the Mark V retained the 1946-48 driveline including the overhead-valve pushrod straight-6 2½L and 3½L engines, now since 1946 produced by Jaguar, which the company had previously purchased from the Standard Motor Company before the war, and the four-speed single-helical gearbox produced by both Jaguar and the Moss Gear Company of Birmingham. The 1½L Standard engine used in previous models was not offered in the Mark V. Claimed power output in this application was [...] for the 2664 cc Mark V and [...] for its more popular 3486 cc sibling. The chassis was new with independent front suspension by double wishbones and torsion bar, an arrangement that would be used by Jaguar for many future vehicles. It also had hydraulic brakes, which Jaguar had been slow to adopt compared to other manufacturers, and an <b>all</b> pressed <b>steel</b> <b>body.</b>|$|R
