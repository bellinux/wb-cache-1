40|$|<b>Assimilation</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> varies {{depending}} on individual learners ’ preferences. In terms of preferred media, some learners are visual, some auditory and others kinaesthetic. In terms of thinking patterns, some are verbal/linguistic or logical/mathematical. If <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> is best achieved in a particular way, achievement in assessments may also depend on how questions or tasks are set, and how learners are required to present material for assessment. In this paper, we present {{the design of a}} flexible e-Assessment system for the accommodation of the different learning styles. The design is inspired by the Design Methodology Management (DMM) technology which provides a framework for the system development. We first discuss learning styles and multiple intelligences and their impacts on learning and assessment, and then we define Design Methodology Management, and finally outline the design of the proposed flexible e-Assessment system...|$|E

Tentative conclusions reached are: first, that model improvement as exemplified by increased resolution, can act {{in the same direction}} as judicious 4 -D <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> remote sounding <b>information,</b> to improve 2 - 3 day numerical weather forecasts.

Given the various data that they contain, they are complex applications, focused on the needs of one type of environmental scientist, closed to amateur’s contributions and unable to support ethological information. Moreover, the data contained in these systems are hardly accessible to non-specialists like the general public or decision-makers. At the same time, new communication protocols, like webservices ensure a better sharing of information between applications; while immersive representations of three-dimensional virtual worlds, also known as metaverses, allow a more natural <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> By putting users in...|$|E

40|$|In the {{knowledge-based}} economy, {{universities are}} encountering dramatic changes.

Institutions of higher education can benefit from KM by creating and maintaining relevant knowledge repositories, improving knowledge access, enhancing the knowledge environment, and valuing knowledge.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the {{methodology}} set up to derive catchment soil moisture from Earth Observation (EO) data using microwave spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from ERS satellites and to study the improvements brought about by an <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> this <b>information</b> into hydrological models. The methodology used to derive EO data is based on the appropriate selection of land cover types for which the radar signal is mainly sensitive to soil moisture variations. Then a hydrological model is chosen, which can take advantage <b>of</b> the new <b>information</b> brought by remote sensing. The <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> soil moisture deduced from EO data into hydrological models is based principally on model parameter updating. The main assumption of this method is that the better the model simulates the current hydrological system, the better the following forecast will be. Another methodology used is a sequential one based on Kalman filtering. These methods have been put forward for use in the European AIMWATER project on the Seine catchment upstream of Paris (France) where dams are operated to alleviate floods in the Paris area...|$|R
