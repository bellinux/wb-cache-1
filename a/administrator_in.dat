5|$|By late 1915, British {{forces in}} the border areas of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, on German East Africa's {{south-western}} flank, were severely stretched. Disease was a constant curse, decimating the ranks. Francis Drummond Chaplin, the British South Africa Company <b>administrator</b> <b>in</b> Southern Rhodesia, offered to provide the British with a column of between 500 and 1,000 askaris, and Whitehall accepted this in March 1916; however, there was then disagreement regarding who would {{foot the bill for}} the organisation of this enterprise.

5|$|Educating the Disfranchised and Disinherited is a 1999 {{biography}} of American General Samuel Chapman Armstrong and his associated normal school for freedmen, Hampton Institute, written by Robert Francis Engs {{and published by}} the University of Tennessee Press. The first full {{biography of}} its kind, the book portrays Armstrong as a complex politician and <b>administrator</b> <b>in</b> the postbellum period who balanced the needs of opposed parties surrounding the Virginia school: its African American students, Southern white neighbors, and Northern philanthropist funders. Previous works presented Armstrong in a polarized fashion, as either a savior or handicap for freedmen. The book emphasizes Armstrong's upbringing as a missionary in Hawaii {{in the development of}} his educational philosophy.|$|E
5|$|In late May 1938, Chandler's {{campaign}} manager publicly claimed that federal relief agencies—especially the Works Progress Administration—were openly working for Barkley's re-election. Although the WPA <b>administrator</b> <b>in</b> Kentucky denied the charges, veteran reporter Thomas Lunsford Stokes launched {{an investigation of}} the agency's activities in the state and eventually raised twenty-two charges of political corruption in a series of eight articles covering the Barkley-Chandler campaign. Federal WPA administrator Harry Hopkins claimed an internal investigation of the agency refuted all but two of Stokes' charges, but Stokes was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Reporting in 1939 for his investigation. In the wake of the investigation Congress passed the Hatch Act of 1939 to limit the WPA's involvement in future elections.|$|E

He eventually rose to be three times mayor of Hulster Ambacht and twice mayor of Hulst. Thanks to powerful allies in the Middelburg chamber of the VOC he was able to successfully appeal for the cancellation of the fines placed on him, and the money was returned. In 1640 he married Anna van Driel, who died that same year while giving birth to Nuyts' third son, also called Pieter. In 1649 he married his third (or perhaps fourth) and final wife, Agnes Granier, who was to outlive him.|$|E

5|$|After {{publishing}} the book, Hergé {{learned that there}} had actually been an Admiral Haddock who {{had served in the}} British Royal Navy during the late 17th and early 18th centuries: Sir Richard Haddock (1629–1715). Richard Haddock {{was in charge of the}} Royal James, the flagship of the Earl of Sandwich during the Battle of Solebay of 1672, the first naval battle of the Third Anglo-Dutch War. During the fighting, the Royal James was set alight and Haddock escaped but had to be rescued from the sea, following which his bravery was recognised by the British monarch, King Charles II. He subsequently took command of another ship, the Royal Charles, before becoming a naval <b>administrator</b> <b>in</b> later life. Admiral Haddock's grandfather, also named Richard, commanded the ship of the line HMS Unicorn during the reign of King Charles I.|$|E
5|$|Born in Northamptonshire, England, Richardson {{originally}} {{served with}} the British Army's Royal Regiment of Artillery as a non-commissioned officer before being transferred to New Zealand to instruct artillery units there. He eventually resigned from the British Army and was commissioned an officer in New Zealand's military. He was in London {{at the time of}} the outbreak of the First World War and served in the Siege of Antwerp and the Gallipoli Campaign with the Royal Naval Division. He then transferred to the New Zealand Expeditionary Force and served as its <b>administrator</b> <b>in</b> the United Kingdom. He continued to serve in the military until his retirement with the rank of major general. In March 1923, he was appointed Administrator of Western Samoa and served in this capacity for five years. Towards the end of his time in Samoa, he ineffectually dealt with increasing civil unrest in the country. Retiring in 1928, he returned to New Zealand and became involved in local body politics in Auckland until his death in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Chintanda's {{affidavit}} {{caused the}} BSAC to become concerned about Clark's continued authority in North-Eastern Rhodesia {{and to begin}} investigating him more thoroughly. The situation was complicated when, after a month's perusal, the Company's lawyers resolved that the courts in Salisbury and Bulawayo held no jurisdiction outside Southern Rhodesia and therefore could not hear any case brought against Clark. On 4 July 1899, Arthur Lawley, the Company's <b>administrator</b> <b>in</b> Matabeleland, wrote to Cape Town to report the situation to the resident High Commissioner for Southern Africa, Alfred Milner. Lawley briefly summarised the charges against Clark and requested permission to hold a court north of the Zambezi {{under the supervision of}} one of three chiefs friendly to the Company. Milner replied on 17 August that he could not legally sanction this, and that Lawley should pursue the matter further only when authority extended over Clark's area.|$|E

5|$|Göth {{returned}} to Vienna {{shortly after the}} Anschluss in 1938 and resumed his party activities. He married Anny Geiger in an SS civil ceremony on 23 October 1938. The couple had three children: Peter, born in 1939, who died of diphtheria at age 7 months; Werner, born in 1940; and a daughter, Ingeborg, born in 1941. The couple maintained a permanent home in Vienna throughout World War II. Initially assigned to 89th SS-Standarte, Göth {{was transferred to the}} 1st SS-Sturmbann of the 11th SS-Standarte {{at the start of the}} war and was promoted to SS-Oberscharführer (staff sergeant) in early 1941.

5|$|Henry II was {{successful}} in quelling the Great Revolt, imprisoning William the Lion until a peace treaty was agreed, extending Henry's authority north into Scotland. In the subsequent years the security situation {{in the north of}} England improved significantly. King John gave control of Bowes Castle to Robert de Vieuxpont, an important <b>administrator</b> <b>in</b> the north, in 1203 and he retained control of the fortification until 1228. John stayed there himself in 1206 and in 1212, and the castle was also used briefly to hold John's niece Eleanor of Brittany, who had been placed under the custody of Vieuxpont. Henry III granted it briefly to William de Blockley and Gilbert de Kirketon, until it was given to Duke Peter of Brittany in 1232, and then to William de Valence. In 1241 Peter II, the Count of Savoy was made the Earl of Richmond and was then given Bowes by the king.|$|E
5|$|Homer ignores {{his studies}} and instead focuses on his preconceived notions of college life through {{adolescent}} movies and TV shows, {{such as the}} fictional The School of Hard Knockers, which stereotype college life as pranks, partying and rigid deans. He also insults the college dean, Dean Peterson, believing {{him to be a}} crusty, conservative <b>administrator.</b> <b>In</b> reality, Peterson relates well with the students and is relatively young. Homer acts like a know-it-all in class and is asked to demonstrate how a proton accelerator operates; consequently, he causes a nuclear meltdown in class. Dean Peterson takes him aside and recommends hiring a tutor. The tutors turn out to be three computer nerds named Benjamin, Doug, and Gary. The trio try to help Homer understand the material from his physics course, but he refuses to cooperate. Instead, he is determined to help them gain a social life by pulling a prank on rival college Springfield A University. The prank involves kidnapping the other school's mascot, a pig named Sir Oinks-a-lot. However, Homer causes the pig to become very ill after feeding it malt liquor, and Benjamin, Doug, and Gary are blamed for the incident.|$|E

5|$|Joining Mikulski as an {{advocate}} for servicing Hubble was NASA's Chief Scientist, physicist John Grunsfeld, who {{was present at the}} meeting when O'Keefe announced the cancellation of the mission.

He briefly considered retiring from NASA, but realized if he stayed, he could continue to advance physics in other ways. Instead, Grunsfeld dedicated himself to finding alternate ways to service the telescope, possibly by sending a robot into orbit to do the job. When O'Keefe announced his resignation as <b>Administrator</b> <b>in</b> December 2004, five days after a National Academy of Sciences committee opposed O'Keefe's position regarding servicing Hubble, the media and science community saw hope for the telescope's servicing mission to be reinstated.|$|E
5|$|The King {{must have}} been {{impressed}} by Edington's performance, because in 1344 he made him treasurer of the realm, a position he held for the exceptionally long period of twelve years. This was a job fraught with problems, as the nation was in serious financial difficulties by the mid-1340s. The treasury was in great debt from the heavy demands of {{the early stages of}} the Hundred Years' War. By then reneging on his debts, the king had lost public confidence, and struggled to obtain new loans. Edington saw the need to bring all royal expenditure under the oversight of the exchequer. This did not entail controlling the King's use of his resources– a move Edward would have resented greatly– but simply attempting to budget all revenues and expenses. By the early 1360s this was largely achieved; a testimony to the capabilities and energy of Edington as an <b>administrator.</b> <b>In</b> 1356 he was named chancellor, a post he held until his retirement from the national scene in 1363, possibly for health reasons.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to obtain {{in-depth}} opinions of the Negro <b>administrators</b> <b>in</b> the public schools of Indiana concerning school integration, school decentralization, curriculum as it relates to the civil rights movement, and Black Power. The data obtained provided a basis for the development of recommendations for implementation in the public schools of Indiana as well as for future research. Lee l identified only eleven school corporations in Indiana which employed Negro administrators. The 156 Negro administrators employed by the eleven school corporations in 1969 - 1970 were asked to participate in the study. The research was planned to investigate seven questions. The major source of data was the "Administrator's Survey Instrument" developed by the writer in questionnaire form. The survey instrument was subjected to examination for content validity and mailed to 156 Negro administrators. One hundred fourteen returned the instrument, a return of seventy-three per cent. A second source of data was personal interviews with twenty Negro administrators randomly selected. Responses to the survey instrument were presented in number and percentages and placed in tables. Data gathered from interviews were reported in summary form as they related to items in the survey instrument. Selected verbatim remarks were also presented. A chi square test of significance was used to determine if there was a significant difference of opinion among the administrative categories of (1) Central Office Administrator; (2) Secondary School Administrator; and (3) Elementary School Administrator. The following were the major conclusions: 1. Negro <b>administrators</b> <b>in</b> Indiana were employed predominantly in school corporations with student enrollments of at least 30, 000. 2. Negro <b>administrators</b> <b>in</b> Indiana were predominantly elementary school principals or assistant principals, or were assigned to central office positions. 3. Negro building principals and assistant principals in Indiana were assigned to schools which had predominantly Negro enrollments. 4. Most Negro <b>administrators</b> <b>in</b> Indiana had been appointed to present positions since the beginning of the Civil Rights movement. 5. The opportunity for Negro <b>administrators</b> <b>in</b> Indiana to affect changes in school policy had increased greatly in the last five years. 6. Negro <b>administrators</b> <b>in</b> Indiana supported the adoption and enforcement of open housing laws. 7. Negro <b>administrators</b> <b>in</b> Indiana expressed confidence in the possibility of integrating the public schools in the near future even though a majority of the administrators perceived white teachers and population as not favoring integration in the public schools. 8. Negro <b>administrators</b> <b>in</b> Indiana supported the development of schools with quality facilities, equipment, and teachers along with efforts to integrate the schools and community. 9. Negro <b>administrators</b> <b>in</b> Indiana were of the opinion the contribution made by Negroes to this nation was not adequately presented in the classroom and they supported the study of Negro history and culture by all students in the public schools. 10. Some Negro <b>administrators</b> <b>in</b> Indiana were of the opinion mandates for integration of teaching staffs had resulted in many outstanding Negro teachers being transferred to predominantly white schools but not many outstanding white teachers being transferred to predominantly Negro schools. 11. Negro <b>administrators</b> <b>in</b> Indiana were of the opinion human relations programs should be developed for students and teachers. Some felt there is a need for communitywide human relations programs to alleviate some of the barriers to integrating the schools and community. 12. Opinions of Negro <b>administrators</b> <b>in</b> Indiana concerning school integration, school decentralization, curriculum as it relates to the civil rights movement, and Black Power as it relates to education, generally did not differ significantly among central office, secondary school, and elementary school administrators.
