Schlesien was re-boilered and converted into a training ship as well in 1936. The following year, Schlesien toured South America, including <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> Argentina in December. By 1939, both ships had been replaced in front-line service by newer ships, and were instead relegated to training duties.|$|E

This duty was interrupted twice; the first came in February, {{when she returned to}} Hampton Roads, Virginia, where she {{and the rest of the}} Atlantic Fleet greeted the Great White Fleet at the conclusion of its circumnavigation of the globe. The second came in April, owing to instability in the Ottoman Empire following the Young Turk Revolution that threatened American interests. Montana departed Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on 2 April, when she was sent to the Mediterranean to protect Americans in the region. She remained there until 23 July, when she left Gibraltar, arriving in Boston on 3 August. She thereafter returned to her normal operations patrolling the eastern coast of the United States.|$|E

5|$|Kikai {{thought that}} {{work on a}} boat might be photogenic, but, having no experience, {{could not get a}} job on one. He was {{eventually}} accepted on a boat fishing for tuna when he displayed the scar from an unneeded appendectomy as evidence of one risk fewer that his presence might force the boat into port. He worked on the boat in the Pacific from 6 April until 9 November 1972, with <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> Manzanillo (Mexico) for provisions. It was during this time that he took his first photographs to be published, in the May 1973 issue of Camera Mainichi. In 1973 he won a prize for his submission to the 14th exhibition of the Japan Advertising Photographers’ Association. But Kikai decided that in order to be a photographer he needed darkroom skills, and he returned to Tokyo to work at Doi Technical Photo (1973–76). He became a freelance photographer in 1984, a year after his first solo exhibition and the same year as his second.|$|E

5|$|South Carolina {{was back}} in Norfolk by 20 December, where she {{remained}} until 6 January 1913. She then departed for another trip south, this time to Colón, Panama, {{at the entrance to}} the recently completed Panama Canal. The ship then took part in maneuvers off Guantanamo Bay before returning to Norfolk on 22 March. Another cruise off the east coast of the United States followed, and included <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> New York from 28 to 31 May, where the USS Maine National Monument was dedicated. The ship briefly trained midshipmen from the US Naval Academy in June before departing at the end of the month for Mexico. There, she cruised off Tampico and Veracruz to protect American interests during the Mexican Civil War. She returned to Norfolk for an overhaul in September that lasted until January 1914.|$|E
5|$|The {{action in}} the book moves from Newby's life in the fashion {{business}} in London to Afghanistan. On the way Newby describes his very brief training in mountaineering in North Wales, <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> Istanbul, and a nearly-disastrous drive across Turkey and Persia. They are driven out to the Panjshir Valley, where they begin their walk, with many small hardships described in a humorous narrative, supported by genuine history of Nuristan and brief descriptions of the rare moments of beauty along the way. Disagreements with Newby's Persian-speaking companion Hugh Carless, and odd phrases in an antique grammar book, are exploited to comic effect.|$|E
5|$|To remedy this situation, Riley hired his {{brother-in-law}} Henry Eitel, an Indianapolis banker, to manage his finances {{and act on}} his behalf to try and extricate him from his contract. Despite discussions and assurances from Pond that he would work to address the problem, Eitel had no success. Pond ultimately made the situation worse by booking months of solid performances, not allowing Riley and Nye a day of rest. These events affected Riley physically and emotionally; he became despondent and began his worst period of alcoholism. During November 1889, the tour was forced to cancel several shows after Riley became severely inebriated at <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> Madison, Wisconsin.|$|E

5|$|Wilhelm Canaris, {{the future}} admiral {{and head of}} the Abwehr during World War II, served aboard the ship {{starting}} on 2 November 1907, his first assignment after graduating from the naval academy. Bremen conducted a tour of South America in late 1908, beginning in September with a call on Buenos Aires, followed by <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. The tour lasted through February 1909, and included stops in Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, and the Dutch Antilles. In March, Bremen returned to the northern Atlantic and visited American ports for the next three months.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Spee {{took his}} ships north to Valparaiso. Since Chile was neutral, only three ships could enter the port at a time; Spee took Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, and Nürnberg in {{first on the}} morning of 3 November, leaving Dresden and Leipzig with the colliers at Mas a Fuera. There, Spee's ships could take on coal while he conferred with the Admiralty Staff in Germany to {{determine}} the strength of remaining British forces in the region. The ships remained in the port for only 24 hours, in accordance with the neutrality restrictions, and arrived at Mas a Fuera on 6 November, where they took on more coal from captured British and French steamers. On 10 November, Dresden and Leipzig were detached for <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> Valparaiso, and five days later, Spee took the rest of the squadron south to St. Quentin Bay in the Gulf of Penas. On 18 November, Dresden and Leipzig met Spee while en route and the squadron reached St. Quentin Bay three days later. There, they took on more coal, since the voyage around Cape Horn would be a long one and it was unclear when they would have another opportunity to coal.|$|E
5|$|Berlin {{was among}} the six light cruisers Germany was {{permitted}} to retain by the Treaty of Versailles. In {{the service of the}} newly reorganized Reichsmarine, Berlin served as a training cruiser, starting in 1922. That year, Wilhelm Canaris was assigned to the ship, which went to Norway in November 1923. In January 1924, Berlin departed German waters for an extended overseas cruise, which was the first time a German warship had done so since the end of World War I. While on the cruise, Canaris met a naval cadet by the name of Reinhard Heydrich, who {{went on to become a}} close friend and eventual architect of The Holocaust. In 1928, Berlin conducted a training cruise around the world, which included <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> Fremantle. Training duties lasted until 1929, when she was withdrawn from service. Starting in 1935, the Kriegsmarine used Berlin as a barracks ship in Kiel. There, she survived World War II; in the aftermath of the war, she was loaded with chemical weapons and scuttled in the Skaggerak to dispose of them, on 31 May 1947.|$|E

5|$|New Hampshire {{was laid}} down on 1 May 1905 at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation in Camden, New Jersey. She was {{launched}} on 30 June 1906 and was christened by Hazel McLane, {{the daughter of}} John McLane, then the Governor of New Hampshire. The ship was commissioned into the US Navy on 19 March 1908; her first commander was Captain Cameron Winslow. After completing final fitting-out work, New Hampshire transported a Marine Expeditionary Regiment to Colón, Panama on 20 June, arriving six days later. She then {{made a series of}} visits to ports on the eastern coast of North America, including Portsmouth, New York, and Bridgeport, along with <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> the Canadian province of Quebec. The ship was then overhauled in New York, followed by training exercises in the Caribbean Sea. On 22 February 1909, she participated in a Naval Review for President Theodore Roosevelt to greet the return of the Great White Fleet in Hampton Roads, Virginia. During this period, Ernest King, later the Chief of Naval Operations during World War II, served aboard the ship in the engine room.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October 1902, Geier began a long cruise {{south to}} the Dutch East Indies, which also {{included}} <b>a</b> <b>stop</b> <b>in</b> Singapore. The ship entered the dry dock in Nagasaki, Japan, for a major overhaul on 2 March 1903, which lasted until 26 April. At this time, Geier was formally assigned to the East Asia Squadron. The ship resumed its normal routine of cruises in East Asian waters with stops in various ports. In February 1904, the Russo-Japanese War broke out; from April to August, Geier was in Chemulpo, which had been captured by the Japanese. By 1905, the ship was suffering wear, having spent over seven years on foreign stations. The repair facilities in Tsingtao were insufficient {{for the amount of}} work that needed to be done, and so Geier was ordered to return to Germany. She left Tsingtao on 14 January and arrived in Kiel on 16 March, where she was decommissioned for a significant period of repair work. Her three-masted schooner barque rig was reduced to a two-masted topsail schooner rig.|$|E

The team suffered in the best-of-five league championship series, falling to the Orlando Twins, 3–1. Nashville compiled an 81–62 record during the season under Stump Merrill. Jamie Werly won the Southern League Most Outstanding Pitcher Award after leading the circuit with 18complete games and 193strikeouts. Don Mattingly and Willie McGee, who both played for the Sounds in 1981, were later promoted to the major leagues. In 1985, Mattingly was named the American League Most Valuable Player and McGee named the National League MVP.|$|E
