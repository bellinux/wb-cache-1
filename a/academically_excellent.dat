5000|$|In Greece {{there are}} no tuition fees as Bachelor-level higher {{education}} and Master-level post-graduate education is provided for free to all Hellene (Greek) citizens as a benefit of citizenship paid by taxes. However, universities accept very few students who have excelled at high school, with the selection being done through the Panhellenic Examinations, a system of state-administered examinations in which the chance of failure is too high and thus {{only a small percentage}} of students is able to pass and there is a limit to the number of students that can be accepted each year. Furthermore, it is difficult for mature students to be accepted at universities. Doctorate-level higher education is often also provided for free, but some universities may charge some fees for PhD degrees. Students who weren't able to pass the Panhellenic Examinations in a few attempts are effectively banned for life from the Greek university system and those who wish to have a higher education must resort to registering at private universities (called colleges, κολέγια) which charge tuition fees or emigrate to other countries in order to get an education. Sometimes it may happen that a student was <b>academically</b> <b>excellent</b> in school but failed to get a good [...] "ethics performance mark" [...] or was disqualified from entering the Panhellenic Examinations because of non-academic factors, since the Greek educational system also marks the student's [...] "ethics performance" [...] (διαλογή, dialogi) rather than only his or her academic performance: for example, an unruly student or a student caught cheating or drinking may receive a disqualifying mark in his or her [...] "ethics performance" [...] which can disqualify the student from entering university (or in extreme cases from continuing in the high school) even if the student has excellent academic skills.|$|E
