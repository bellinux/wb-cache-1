This paper starts out with a definition of sustainability as such, while also describing the most pressing issues within ecological sustainability. The biggest part of related research {{is dedicated to the}} persuasive technologies and three main factors of ability, trigger and motivation. We also talk about a fourth, additional factor of an emotional relationship. Besides persuasive technologies, this part describes sustainable Human-Computer Interaction, location-based services, and ethical issues are mentioned as well. The first part of the next section is dedicated to the description of a High Fidelity prototype of persuasive mobile application. The second part talks about quantitative and qualitative methods used while collecting data. <b>After</b> <b>that,</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> is presented with the study results, which are then also analyzed. The following part discuss these results in a more depth. In the end, we summarize obtained results and the whole study...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{is to examine the}} {{development}} of the upper secondary school physics course and from this get a better understanding why the course is organized the way it is today. The timeless argument for studying science in school will begin this essay. <b>After</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> will be aware of when important discoveries in physics were made. Then school history is presented. In this part we are told when the first school started in Sweden, but the focus lies on the upper secondary school and the physics course. The last part studies the history of physics courses in Sweden. Here the syllabus from year 1561 to year 2000 are very important. The method I have used in this piece of work is therefore text analyses. Some major results are difficult to achieve in this type of essay. The main goal with this project is to give the reader a better historical view of the physics courses in school. This project can also give teachers and teacher students a wider perspective, both a time perspective and a perspective on physics as a subject. Keywords: the physics subject, upper secondary school, history, syllabu...|$|E

5000|$|Some {{studies have}} found a P600 {{elicited}} by words {{where there is no}} grammatical error and no [...] "garden path" [...] (i.e., where the word is exactly what <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> would expect), but when the sentence is complex because {{there are a number of}} noun phrases active. This has most often been the case when <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> has to [...] "re-activate" [...] a word that appeared earlier in the sentence. For example, in a sentence like [...] "Who did you imitate?", the word who appears in the beginning of the sentence but is actually the direct object of imitate, and must be interpreted in that way (i.e., as [...] "you imitated who?"); several {{studies have found}} <b>that</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> sees <b>the</b> word imitate he or she has a P600 response, possibly as a result of re-activating who. [...] These sorts of P600s get stronger as the number of noun phrases active in the sentences increases, suggesting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> P600 generator is sensitive to the level of complexity in a sentence.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{theory of}} hyperforests has many {{applications}} in fields ranging from mathematical theories, computer sciences to industrial technologies. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to systematically outline this widely scattered theory by making use of definitions and theorems found by the author himself, so as to make it into a coherent and independent mathematical theory. The paper begins with the definition of hyperforests as hypergraphs without cycles, in a sense very much similar to that of forests being graphs without cycles. Then, the concept of decomposition is introduced for hypergraphs. The following questions are raised and answered: when is a hypergraph decomposable? How? Thereafter, twig sequences are introduced, and it is proved that if a hypergraph has a twig sequence, then all its maximal intersection sequences are twig sequences. We then prove the so-called fundamental theorem, which says that a hypergraph is a hyperforests if and only if it has twig sequences. After exposing a few equivalent conditions for a hypergraph to be a hyperforest, we give a simple but important property of hyperforests, which essentially explains why the theory of hyperforests has so many applications. <b>After</b> <b>that,</b> we show <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> a way of testing if a hypergraph is a hyperforest and of finding twig sequences for a hyperforest. The paper ends with the concept of Markov trees, which provides us with a clearer picture of hypertrees-connected hyperforests, and which provides a useful mechanism for the applications of the theory...|$|R
50|$|One notable {{characteristic}} on <b>the</b> way <b>that</b> <b>The</b> Girl Who Was Plugged In {{was written}} {{was how the}} author used a male narrator {{to tell the story}} to a predominantly male audience in order to play with readers’ expectations on how the story will pan out. Tiptree essentially tells this story by way of a male narrator to most likely a 1970s male science fiction consumer. Since this story is continuously told through a male narrator, this comes to highlight issues that male readers might have when reading this short story. According to Stevenson, Tiptree utilizes this way of telling the story in order to turn male readers expectations of P. Burke and of the ways the story will turn out upside down. This narrator rebukes <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> on several occasions for having these false expectations. Stevenson gives an example of this with the actual attempted suicide of P. Burke on the park bench. The narrator yells at <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> because he is not interested in P. Burke but rather in the surrounding city. The expectation here is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> life of the ugly P. Burke is relatively unimportant compared to the surroundings to <b>the</b> targeted male <b>reader.</b> Stevenson points out <b>that</b> <b>after</b> this, <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> is rebuked three different times for not focusing on P. Burke but each time this happens, the narration is moved to descriptions of the futuristic soundings, presumably in accord with what <b>the</b> male <b>reader</b> truly desires to read about. This goes back to what Heather J. Hicks states about the importance and success of the ideal feminine body compared to the non-ideal feminine body. P. Burke’s body is considered unimportant and the way the story is written and paced suggests just this point.|$|R
