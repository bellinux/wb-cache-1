Of particular interest is the prevalence of standardised methods, documents and terms of trade, all of which point, in a similar way to that of the Guide du Commerce, to the slave trade's technical contributions to capitalism (Petre-Grenouilleau 2004, 352). The archival evidence illustrates the rationalisation and institutionalisation of an economic system, albeit a particular outlier, and its progressive sophistication in terms of operating processes, creating thereby the illusion of a rational business model. <b>accounting</b> <b>manuals,</b> institutional networks, knowledge transmission, triangular trade, France,...|$|R

40|$|This is {{a report}} of the project titled "Development of Tailor-made <b>Accounting</b> <b>Manual</b> for Laela Secondary School" {{submitted}} in partial fulfillment for the requirement for the degree of master of science in Community Economic Development in the Southern New Hampshire University at the Open University of Tanzania. Laela Secondary School (LSS) is located in Laela village in Sumbawanga district, Rukwa region. Laela village is located along Sumbawanga - Tunduma road, about 100 km from Sumbawanga town and 230 km from Mbeya municipal. The inhabitants of the area are predominantly Wafipa and farming is their major occupation. The objective of Laela Secondary School is to provide secondary education in the Laela parish mandate area encompassing 25 villages. The area has no other secondary school despite the fact that each village has at least one public primary school. The main activity of the Laela Secondary school as the name suggests is to provide secondary education to children who have finished primary school. LSS was started in 1992 and is owned and managed by the Catholic Diocese of Sumbawanga. The registration number of the school is S 503. The needs assessment was conducted in participatory manner whereby participants, used participatory tools to identify priority problem facing the school. Moreover an in-depth insight of the priority problem identified was analyzed in order {{to come up with an}} effective solution. The exercise was accomplished by conducting a survey in which questionnaire was used to collect information. The data collected were analyzed using SPSS software. The survey using structured questionnaire was complemented by conducting key informant interviews, whereby the identified people with knowledge and experience with the project subject were interviewed. Other methods used include observation and document reading. The important findings were that 90 % of the informed respondents were of the opinion that the school accounting procedures were not written and known to all concerned while 10 % agreed. 71 % of respondents were not sure if there were any reports produced from the operation of the IGA's of the school. 24 % were of the opinion that the reports were produced twice in a year but they were not distributed to all stakeholders while 5 % agreed that reports were produced twice and distributed to all stakeholders. Research findings have revealed that lack of <b>accounting</b> <b>manual</b> has caused poor budgeting, low school fees and poor decision making by board and management due to lack of proper information. This has resulted into financial problems to the extent that the school cannot pay competitive remuneration to its staff and thus teachers are few. Few teachers at LSS have resulted into poor performance of students in final exams and this does not attract other students to join this school. A tailor-made <b>accounting</b> <b>manual</b> for the LSS has been prepared covering the organization of accounting department, routine accounting procedures, accounting for stocks, accounting for fixed assets, budgeting and financial reporting. The proposed <b>accounting</b> <b>manual</b> has been accepted by the school and put into use. (Author abstract) El-Nshau, V. Y. (2005).

40|$|Vertical {{integration}} of production processes at international {{level and the}} resulting fragmentation of the value chains increasingly question the relevance of traditional trade indicators.

The strength with which the concept of value added has imposed itself as the yardstick for the measurement of international trade has very fruitful analytical implications in the context of national accounts.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to extend to {{accounting}} and accounting texts the arguments of Phillips which suggest that organisational analysis can be enriched by a greater interface with narrative fiction as a means to bring organisations to life. The paper also introduces the work of Bottin which argues that accounting manuals can be considered as source documents for economic history, more than simply being of purely pedagogical value. Both approaches inform the research into the specialised <b>accounting</b> <b>manual,</b> the Guide du Commerce of Gaignat de l'Aulnais. Design/methodology/approach – This paper uses archival-based historical methods to examine the Guide du Commerce and the social and economic milieu presented therein. It has developed its analysis through the examination of both primary and secondary sources to underscore the business and social networks of the milieu and to illustrate accounting as narrative. Findings – In his manual, Gaignat recreates merchant activities and commercial relations of eighteenth century France. Gaignat does not content himself with re-copying material at his disposal or with creating fictitious examples. Rather, through his in-depth development of case studies and examples of actual accounting methods, he offers the reader insights into the strategic nature of the social and economic milieu in which commercial success might be achieved. Practical implications – The research approach is transferable to other settings, motivating renewed interest in the history of accounting literature. The stories related in the Guide du Commerce point to the potential value of accounting manuals and other similar documents as historical sources when such sources no longer exist or are limited. Originality/value – The research method is original in that the methodological approach is new to accounting history, but part of a debate within history more generallyAccounting, France, History, Narratives, Publications, Storytelling...|$|E
