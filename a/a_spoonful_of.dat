25|$|On {{their next}} adventure, Bert {{introduces}} {{the children to}} his friends the chimney sweeps ("Step in Time"). The sweeps' dance eventually enters the house, causing chaos. As the sweeps quickly exit, George receives a telegram from the bank requesting his presence there. George assumes that it is to seal his fate and decides it's time to sell the family heirloom. However, the vase is shattered accidentally by Mrs. Brill, who goes into a despairing shock since she had been cleaning it {{from the top of}} the shelf. When she is being led away for comfort, George goes to clean the broken pile himself, to find it reveal a collection of gingerbread stars from his childhood. This leads to a brief moment of reflection for George ("A Man Has Dreams/ <b>A</b> <b>Spoonful</b> <b>of</b> Sugar (Reprise)"). After shaking hands with Bert, George leaves to meet the Chairman of the Bank.|$|E
25|$|Fries {{are very}} popular in Belgium, where they are known as frieten (in Dutch) or frites (in French), and the Netherlands, where among the working classes they are known as patat in the north and, in the south, friet. In Belgium, fries are sold in shops called friteries (French), frietkot/frituur (Dutch), or Fritüre/Frittüre (German). They are served with a large variety of Belgian sauces and eaten either {{on their own or}} with other snacks. Traditionally fries are served in a cornet de frites (French), patatzak/frietzak/fritzak (Dutch/Flemish), or Frittentüte (German), a white {{cardboard}} cone, then wrapped in paper, with <b>a</b> <b>spoonful</b> <b>of</b> sauce (often mayonnaise) on top. They may also be served with other traditional fast food items, such as frikandel, burgers, fishsticks, meatballs or croquette. In the Netherlands, fries are sold at snack bars and often served a sauce like Fritessaus or curry ketchup.|$|E

500|$|For {{the next}} week De Long's party {{struggled}} on, sometimes making barely a mile a day. Although they jettisoned more of their possessions on the way, De Long insisted on carrying his maps and journals. His entry for October 10 recorded that there was [...] "nothing for supper but <b>a</b> <b>spoonful</b> <b>of</b> glycerine". A few days later [...] Alexey, the group's principal hunter, shot a ptarmigan which provided soup. But Alexey was weakening, and on October 17 he died. On October 20, trapped by the weather and without supplies, the party came to a final halt. [...] Throughout the march De Long had written up his journal each day, but after October 20 his entries became intermittent, largely limited to terse statements of the dying and the dead. He noted the deaths of Kaak and Lee on October 21, Iverson on the 28th, Dressler on the 29th. His last entry, dated October 30, records the deaths of Boyd and Görtz and ends [...] "Mr Collins dying".|$|E

2500|$|Ergodic {{theory is}} often {{concerned}} with ergodic transformations. [...] The intuition behind such transformations, which act {{on a given}} set, {{is that they do}} a thorough job [...] "stirring" [...] the elements of that set [...] (e.g., if the set is a quantity of hot oatmeal in a bowl, and if <b>a</b> <b>spoonful</b> <b>of</b> syrup is dropped into the bowl, then iterations of the inverse of an ergodic transformation of the oatmeal will not allow the syrup to remain in a local subregion of the oatmeal, but will distribute the syrup evenly throughout. [...] At the same time, these iterations will not compress or dilate any portion of the oatmeal: they preserve the measure that is density.) [...] Here is the formal definition.|$|E
2500|$|Newborns {{were held}} upside down by {{their feet and}} lifted up and down to prevent 'livergrown' disorder. Some {{midwives}} believed that placing the child next to the mother under the quilt would force 'bold hives' out of the baby's body. Others recommended a little catnip or ground ivy tea, a drop or two of turpentine, or <b>a</b> <b>spoonful</b> <b>of</b> whiskey in order to [...] "hive" [...] the baby. A piece of cloth was tied around the newborn's waist for six week to protect the navel area which was thought to easily rupture due to its weakness. The newborn’s hair could not be cut {{during the first few}} weeks of life for fear of death before six months of age. If a child whose hair was cut too early did not die, it was feared that the child would become a thief later in life. If someone stepped over the child, this would stunt the newborn’s growth. The day of the week on which the child was born also said a lot about the child. Children born on a Tuesday were said to be unlucky.|$|E
