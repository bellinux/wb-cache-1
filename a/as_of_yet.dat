5|$|On February 4, 2015 it was {{revealed}} that during the recording of their main TV show on January 28, a 12-year-old member (name withheld) of Japanese all-girl singing group 3B Junior suffered from air embolism, losing consciousness and falling in a coma as a result of air bubbles blocking the flow of blood to the brain, after inhaling huge quantities of helium as part of a game. The incident was not made public until a week later. The staff of TV Asahi held an emergency press conference to communicate that the member had been taken to the hospital and is showing signs of rehabilitation such as moving eyes and limbs, but her consciousness has not been sufficiently recovered <b>as</b> <b>of</b> <b>yet.</b> Police have launched an investigation due to a neglect of safety measures.|$|E

In addition, studies involving various complement proteins on fungal surfaces suggest that M. plumbeus spores can activate all pathways of the complement system. Mucor plumbeus is not known to produce any mycotoxins.|$|E
25|$|The Denali Complex, dated roughly to 10,500 to 8,000 years ago, was {{originally}} defined by F. H West. Some Denali Complex archaeological sites: Mt. Hayes, Swan Point, and Gerstle River.

The {{relationship between the}} proposed Nenana and Denali complexes is <b>as</b> <b>of</b> <b>yet</b> unresolved. The boreal forest in Interior Alaska (Interior Alaska-Yukon lowland taiga of Tanana region and Copper Plateau taiga of Ahtna region) was established 8,000 years ago.|$|E

25|$|Hancock {{received}} {{considerable attention}} when, in May 1963, he joined Davis's Second Great Quintet. Davis personally sought out Hancock, whom {{he saw as}} one of the most promising talents in jazz. The rhythm section Davis organized was young but effective, comprising bassist Ron Carter, 17-year-old drummer Williams, and Hancock on piano. After George Coleman and Sam Rivers each took a turn at the saxophone spot, the quintet gelled with Wayne Shorter on tenor saxophone. This quintet is often regarded {{as one of the}} finest jazz ensembles <b>as</b> <b>of</b> <b>yet.</b>|$|E
25|$|The male {{bull shark}} {{is able to}} begin {{reproducing}} around the age of 15 years while the female cannot begin reproducing {{until the age of}} 18 years. The size of a fully matured female bull shark to produce viable eggs for fertilization seems to be 175cm to 235cm. The courting routine between bull sharks has not been observed in detail <b>as</b> <b>of</b> <b>yet.</b> The male likely bites the female on the tail until she can turn upside down and the male can copulate at that point. At some points, the harassment of the male can become violent. Seeing scratches and other marks on a mature female which may be from the mating ritual is not uncommon.|$|E
25|$|On 2 May 2014, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{confirmed}} the first diagnosis of MERS in the United States at Community Hospital in Munster Indiana. The man diagnosed was {{a health care}} worker {{who had been in}} Saudi Arabia a week earlier, and was reported to be in good condition. A second patient who also traveled from Saudi Arabia was reported in Orlando, Florida on 12 May 2014. On 14 May 2014, officials in the Netherlands reported the first case has appeared. On Saturday, 17 May 2014, a man from Illinois who was a business associate of the first U.S. case (he had met and shook hands with the Indiana health care worker) tested positive for the MERS coronavirus, but has not, <b>as</b> <b>of</b> <b>yet,</b> displayed symptoms (others are probably also, at least temporarily if not permanently, non-symptomatic carriers). The CDC's Dr. David Swerdlow, who is leading the agency's response, said the man, who feels well and has not yet sought and does not yet need medical care, has not been deemed an official case yet and prevention guidelines have not changed. Laboratory tests showed evidence of past infection in his blood.|$|E

25|$|After five years, a new brand {{extension}} was introduced on July 19, 2016. Raw drafted the WWE Women's Champion, the United States Champion, and the WWE Tag Team Champions, while SmackDown drafted the WWE Champion and the Intercontinental Champion; NXT champions were ineligible to be drafted. This distribution of championships remained unchanged at the Battleground pay-per-view, {{which took place}} the Sunday immediately following the draft. With the WWE Championship being defended exclusively on SmackDown, Stephanie McMahon and Mick Foley introduced the WWE Universal Championship to be Raw's world title; the WWE Championship was subsequently renamed to WWE World Championship (but reverted to the former in December 2016). As SmackDown was lacking a tag team championship and a women's championship, Shane McMahon and Daniel Bryan introduced the SmackDown Tag Team Championship and SmackDown Women's Championship. Subsequently, WWE renamed the WWE Women's Championship and the WWE Tag Team Championship as the Raw Women's Championship and the Raw Tag Team Championship, respectively. With this, each brand had a world championship, a secondary championship, a tag team championship, and a women's championship: the Universal, United States, Raw Tag Team, and Raw Women's on Raw, and the World, Intercontinental, SmackDown Tag Team, and SmackDown Women's on SmackDown. However, since Raw was the exclusive home of WWE's cruiserweight division, they also created a new WWE Cruiserweight Championship for their brand. As of November 29, 2016, in addition to Raw, the Cruiserweight Championship is defended on the cruiserweight-exclusive show, 205 Live. The WWE United Kingdom Championship was unveiled in December 2016 with its inaugural holder determined in January 2017. The title {{is intended to be}} the top championship of an <b>as</b> <b>of</b> <b>yet</b> announced WWE Network show to be produced in the United Kingdom. In the interim, it is being defended on NXT.|$|E
500|$|Tityridae {{is family}} of suboscine {{passerine}} birds found in forests and woodlands in the Neotropics. The approximately 30 species {{in this family}} were formerly spread over the families Tyrannidae, Pipridae and Cotingidae (see Taxonomy). <b>As</b> <b>of</b> <b>yet,</b> no widely accepted common name exists for the family, although [...] "tityras and allies" [...] and [...] "tityras, mourners and allies" [...] have been used.

500|$|Both {{male and}} female {{humpback}} whales vocalize, but only males produce the long, loud, complex [...] "song" [...] for which the species is famous. Each song consists of several sounds in a low register, varying in amplitude and frequency and typically lasting from 10 to 20 minutes. Individuals may sing continuously for more than 24 hours. Cetaceans have no vocal cords, instead, they produce sound via a larynx like structure found in the throat, the mechanism of which has not <b>as</b> <b>of</b> <b>yet</b> been clearly identified. Whales {{do not have to}} exhale to produce sound.|$|E

500|$|The {{government}} decided {{to close a}} number of government libraries without consultation on the closings or the process involved. [...] The {{manner in which it}} was done received significant criticism because it has resulted in the remaining information being put into a disarray, rendering it inaccessible for research, and in a loss of information of a magnitude <b>as</b> <b>of</b> <b>yet</b> unknown. [...] This is because no significant effort was made to inventory the material, to determine what should be preserved, and no one really knows what was discarded. [...] Much material was simply given away, thrown away, or lost in process, very likely including valuable data and historical documents.|$|E
