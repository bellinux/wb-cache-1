500|$|A {{chorus of}} nymphs and shepherds join Orfeo around {{the tomb of}} his wife Euridice in a solemn chorus of mourning; Orfeo is only able to utter Euridice's name (Chorus and Orfeo: [...] "Ah, se intorno"/"Ah! Dans ce bois"). Orfeo sends the others away and sings of his grief in the aria [...] "Chiamo il mio ben"/"Objet de mon amour", the three verses of which are preceded by {{expressive}} recitatives. This technique was extremely radical {{at the time and}} indeed proved overly so for those who came after Gluck: Mozart chose to retain the unity of the aria. Amore (Cupid) appears, telling Orfeo that he may go to the Underworld and return with his wife on the condition that he not look at her until they <b>are</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> earth (1774 only: aria by Amour, [...] "Si les doux accords"). As encouragement, Amore informs Orfeo that his present suffering shall be short-lived with the aria [...] "Gli sguardi trattieni"/"Soumis au silence". Orfeo resolves to take on the quest. In the 1774 version only he delivers an ariette ("L'espoir renaît dans mon âme") in the older, showier, Italian style, originally composed for an occasional entertainment, Il Parnaso confuso (1765), and subsequently re-used in another one, Le feste d'Apollo (1769).|$|E

2500|$|Debnam-Carey {{viewed the}} {{betrayal}} as a relief and release for {{herself as an}} actor, and as a [...] "very honest" [...] and [...] "open" [...] moment for Lexa. [...] "It's the first real time you get to see—apart from —this is a scene where she makes a really strong choice, {{but you can see}} that it's hard for her to do, and she does care," [...] Debnam-Carey stated. She said Clarke's portrayer, Eliza Taylor, was [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "great to work with and between the two of us, we were just very connected with each other and made sure that that was the strong force of that scene." [...] To Debnam-Carey, Lexa [...] "showing that she cared, even in that moment of betrayal" [...] was Lexa being real. Debnam-Carey argued that even though Lexa was upset by the betrayal, she is a very hardened person and her people continued to be her main concern. She does not think Lexa was preoccupied with the repercussions. Unlike Rothenberg, Debnam-Carey felt [...] " [...] always knew [...] was going to [...] Now those cards <b>are</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the table, if she wants to restart an alliance or whatever else." ...|$|E

60|$|These {{factors have}} already reduced Germany's annual surplus {{to less than}} the $500,000,000 at which we arrived on other grounds as the maximum of her annual payments. But even if the {{rejoinder}} be made, {{that we have not}} yet allowed for the lowering of the standard of life and comfort in Germany which may reasonably be imposed on a defeated enemy,[133] there is still a fundamental fallacy in the method of calculation. An annual surplus available for home investment can only be converted into a surplus available for export abroad by a radical change in the kind of work performed. Labor, while it may be available and efficient for domestic services in Germany, may yet be able to find no outlet in foreign trade. We <b>are</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> the same question which faced us in our examination of the export trade--in what export trade is German labor going to find a greatly increased outlet? Labor can only he diverted into new channels with loss of efficiency, and a large expenditure of capital. The annual surplus which German labor can produce for capital improvements at home is no measure, either theoretically or practically, of the annual tribute which she can pay abroad.|$|E
