C.J. later sadly relates to Toby how deeply she regretted sleeping with Hoynes. Distressed and in need of comfort, she decides to finally call her college boyfriend Ben, who has been trying to get in touch with her (and been ignored or shunted aside) for quite a while.|$|E

Burroughs recalled that Whitman had been [...] "deeply interested in what I tell him of the hermit thrush, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> largely used the information I have given him {{in one of his}} principal poems". Burroughs described the song as [...] "the finest sound in nature...perhaps more of an evening than a morning hymn...a voice of that calm, sweet solemnity one attains to in his best moments." [...] Whitman took copious notes of his conversations with Burroughs on the subject, writing of the hermit thrush that it [...] "sings oftener after sundown...is very secluded...likes shaded, dark places...His song is a hymn...in swamps—is very shy...never sings near the farm houses—never in the settlement—is the bird of the solemn primal woods & of Nature pure & holy." [...] Burroughs published an essay in May 1865 in which he described the hermit thrush as [...] "quite a rare bird, of very shy and secluded habits" [...] found [...] "only in the deepest and most remote forests, usually in damp and swampy localities".

2500|$|Jesse is an Australian {{resistance}} sailor and Derek Reese's love interest. In her timeline, she {{sailed to}} Australia to deliver supplies aboard the upgraded nuclear submarine , captained by a reprogrammed Terminator, Queeg, {{of which she}} is the executive officer. Queeg diverts the submarine {{to pick up a}} package and return it to John Connor. Her crew is curious of what is in the package so they open it. Inside is a T-1001 and one of the crew members, a woman, points her gun at it. The T-1001 kills her and takes her form, then shakes its finger at the rest of the crew. Queeg kills a crewman after he beat on Jesse. Jesse does not trust Queeg so she relieves him of command. Queeg does not obey her orders so she terminates him and destroys the submarine in an attempt to kill the T-1001. On her way out, she encounters the T-1001 and it tells her, [...] "the answer is no." [...] In 2007, she is on a possibly self-imposed mission to find and stop Cameron from adversely influencing young John, by recruiting Riley Dawson in the future and bringing her back to frame Cameron for her murder. In the future from which Jesse comes, John has withdrawn from humans and speaks only with Cameron. It is unclear whether this mission is self-appointed, but comments by her and the fact she was able to access the time travel machinery with Riley suggests others in the Resistance leadership group may share her concerns about Cameron's influence on John. John Connor later figures out that Jesse killed Riley and informs Derek, but orders her life to be spared. Derek confronts Jesse. He tells her that they are from two different futures and that he doesn't know who she is. He tells her, [...] "John Connor wanted to let you go. I'm not John Connor." [...] He pulls his gun on her and she takes off running. Whether or not Derek actually kills her is left ambiguous, although he does pull the trigger on his handgun. When asked about it by John he just says, [...] "John Connor wanted to let her go." [...] This could either mean that he obeyed John Connor's order or since he is not John Connor, he didn't want to let her go and he shot her. Later on in a flashback, Cameron is seen talking to Jesse. Cameron tells her that she is sorry for her loss. She says that the pressure from leaving the submarine killed her baby, she was pregnant with Derek's baby. Jesse tells Cameron, [...] "Tell John Connor it said [...] "The answer is no"" [...] Then, Jesse asks Cameron, [...] "If the answer is no, what was the question?" [...] Cameron answers with, [...] "Will you join us?" [...] Cameron tells Derek about the miscarriage <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> never had any kids.|$|E
