40|$|In {{this paper}} a novel {{electronic}} payment protocol suitable for ``peer-to-peer'' (P 2 P) networks is presented. It implements electronic cash-based transactions, between buyers and merchants. It {{is based on}} a bank account, though it can be easily extended and can be readily applied to other <b>account</b> <b>payment</b> models like debit cards. The proposed protocol is designed using Millicent's main concept (scrip) and the digital envelope cryptography technique. In this protocol, financial institutions become partners in the e-commerce transaction, conducted by their customers over the Internet. The innovation of the proposed protocol is the reduction of the involvement of the financial institutions to ancillary support services like helping on establishing trust between the parties and at the completion of the peer-to-peer payment transaction. Moreover, the proposed system can be characterized as distributed allocation of provinces to merchants, who are responsible for locally authorizing payments. Finally, it is optimized for repeated payments to the same merchants...|$|E

Then, the personal account only has the payment records of employees, which provides numerical basis for granting individual account pension, as well as the balance of individual account pension. At the same time, the unified financial accounts include personal <b>account</b> <b>payment</b> income and fund payment income, which are used to pay for the basic pension, transitional pension, personal account pension, and individual account return expenses. The return of personal accounts also refers to the balance of individual account that granted to employees’ heirs in the situation that employees died. Moreover, if individual account is exhausted and the employees still survive, 9 the government would continue to grant individual account fund. To guarantee the reliability of the conclusion, this paper also show results of the situation with personal account funding in the part of sensitivity analysis.|$|E

40|$|Standard {{forms of}} {{contract}} and Construction Contracts Act (CCA) are designed as {{primary means of}} mitigating payment problems within the New Zealand construction industry. However, payment problems {{have been on the}} increase since last four decades. The research therefore evaluated the effectiveness of those payment provisions. Construction practitioners surveyed were of the opinion that overall the provisions in the standard forms of contract and the CCA are moderately effective. The right to claim and right to respond to claims under both documents are more effective than the provisions for non-payments. Detail analyses of views indicate that 20 - 30 % of participants found the provisions highly effective while another equal percentage considered them slightly effective. This distribution of effectiveness is supported by the views which include: the CCA improves payment problems as it resolves disputes faster; the CCA is incapable of guaranteeing payment; failure to comply with the CCA provisions and reluctance to apply the provisions on certain reputed project partners. The research therefore recommends {{that there needs to be}} changes to the CCA to have a separate mean(s) of securing payment in the form of escrow <b>account,</b> <b>payment</b> bond or any other means. This would encourage construction parties to use the CCA provisions and thereby improve the effectiveness of the overall Act...|$|E
