The International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI) was {{established}} by several sections of the International as an <b>alternative</b> <b>centre</b> to the International Secretariat, in which they felt a revisionist faction led by Michel Pablo had taken power, and recommitted themselves to the Lenin-Trotsky Theory of the Party and Trotsky's theory of Permanent Revolution.

50|$|Under Edward's leadership, {{the scale}} of <b>alternative</b> <b>centres</b> of power diminished markedly: the {{separate}} court of Mercia was dissolved; the Danish leaders were in large part brought to heel or expelled; the Welsh princes were constrained from aggression of the borders and even the West Saxon bishoprics divided.

50|$|While {{the title}} of the song refers to the Black and Tans of the War of Independence era, the {{specific}} context of the song is a dispute between Irish republican and loyalist neighbours in inner-city Dublin in the 1920s. For centuries, Dublin was the centre of The Pale, an area fully under control of the Crown, even when England had little control of the rest of Ireland. It was only with the arrival of Protestant settlers in Ulster in the Plantation of Ulster of the 17th century that the north of Ireland became an <b>alternative</b> <b>centre</b> of Loyalism to Britain. Dublin continued to elect unionist politicians and voluntary service in the British Army was a popular career choice amongst working-class Dubliners, both Catholic and Protestant. The perceived loyalty of Dublin was emphasised by its policing. The rest of Ireland was policed by the militarily organised Royal Irish Constabulary, a form of gendarmerie, whereas Dublin had its own police force, the Dublin Metropolitan Police, which was a civilian force similar to that found in any large British city.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{is divided into}} four related sections of work. The first relates to the rim wall wear of the existing unlubricated steel, and polyethylene centre bearing components. Based on these findings, {{the second and third}} sections of work includes materials characterisation of <b>alternative</b> <b>centre</b> bearing surfaces - plasma nitrided molybdenum steel and stellite 6 laser clad layers, respectively. Finally, in the last section of work, the reciprocating pin-on-plate wear test method is used to evaluate the friction and wear of the existing and <b>alternative</b> <b>centre</b> bearing materials. The worn dimensions of the AISI 1053 steel, Hadfield steel, and polyethylene centre bearing components were determined. The wear of the high density polyethylene centre bowl liner was negligible. The rim wall wear of the unlubricated steel components was greatest in the longitudinal direction, whilst there was negligible wear in the lateral direction. The average wear depth rate for the AISI 1053 steel top centre was approximately twice that of the Hadfield steel centre bowl liner. The cross-sectional microhardness and microstructure of one worn AISI 1053 steel top centre and two worn Hadfield steel centre bowl liners were determined. The worn Hadfield steel centre bowl liners showed significant near surface work hardening. The wear mechanism for the AISI 1053 steel top centre was plastic strain accumulation in conjunction with low cycle fatigue. The quench and tempered AISI 4016 molybdenum steel samples were plasma nitrided at 450, 500, 550 and 580 2 ̆ 6 #;C using 75...|$|E
