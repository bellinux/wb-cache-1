40|$|Abstract. Effective testing {{involves}} preparing test oracles {{and test}} cases, two activities which are too tedious to be effectively performed by humans, {{yet for the}} most part remain manual. The <b>AutoTest</b> <b>unit</b> testing framework automates both, by using Eiffel contracts — already present in the software — as test oracles, and generating objects and routine arguments to exercise all given classes; manual tests can also be added, and all failed test cases are automatically retained for regression testing, in a “minimized ” form retaining only the relevant instructions. AutoTest has already detected numerous hitherto unknown bugs in production software...|$|E
40|$|The ARAL {{system of}} the VLTI is a {{multipurpose}} facility that helps to have the interferometric instruments ready for night observations. It consists of an artificial source (allowing a Mach-Zehnder mode of the interferometric instruments for <b>autotest),</b> an alignment <b>unit</b> (verifying {{the position of the}} celestial target in the VLTI field-of-view), and an optical path router (controlling the optical switchyard and the instrument feeding-optics in the VLTI laboratory). With the multiplication of VLTI instruments and their specific features (wavelength coverage, number of beams), an upgrade of ARAL (from its November 2002 version) had to be carried out: the alignment unit has been redesigned, as well as the artificial source. This source will provide a point in the visible and in J, H, K and N infrared bands, split into four beams (with a zero optical path difference at the reference position). After a description of the optomechanics and of the computer architecture of ARAL, we detail the difficulties of building an interferometric artificial source with a wide spectral range...|$|R
