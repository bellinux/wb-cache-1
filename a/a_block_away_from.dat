5|$|The new construction, {{part of the}} city's and the MTA's {{master plan}} for the Far West Side, {{extended}} the IRT Flushing Line west from Times Square to Eleventh Avenue, then south to 34th Street. Although the West Side Stadium plan was rejected by city and state planning agencies, the 7 Subway Extension plan received approval to move ahead, as New York political leaders {{wanted to see the}} warehouse district west of Eighth Avenue and north of 34th Street redeveloped as part of the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project, and subway service was to be an essential part of that effort. The extension also serves the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, which was expanded in 2008–2014 and is located <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the station entrances.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{newspapers}} and media publications {{are based in}} Casa Presei Libere (The House of the Free Press), a landmark of northern Bucharest, originally named Casa Scânteii after the Communist Romania-era official newspaper Scînteia. Casa Presei Libere {{is not the only}} Bucharest landmark that grew out of the media and communications industry. Palatul Telefoanelor ("The Telephone Palace") was the first major modernist building on Calea Victoriei in the city's centre, and the massive, unfinished communist-era Casa Radio looms over a park <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Opera.|$|E
25|$|The spacious lots were {{considered}} highly desirable {{because they were}} close to Drake Park, which runs along {{the east side of}} the Deschutes River. In addition, many home sites had choice views of the Cascade Mountain peaks. The area was only <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Bend's downtown business district so the city hall, public library, and local Catholic, Methodist, and Episcopalian churches were within easy walking distance. The district was also within walking distance of the Brooks-Scanlon and Shevlin-Hixon lumber mills. As a result, the Drake Park district quickly became the preferred neighborhood for the city's most prominent businessmen.|$|E

25|$|Two more hotels {{were built}} in 1890: the Grand Avenue Hotel and the Great Southern Hotel. The Grand Avenue Hotel was located only <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the train station and appealed to {{families}} accompanying students traveling {{to and from the}} Meridian Male College. The Grand Avenue was damaged, along with a large portion of downtown, by a tornado on March 2, 1906. Several photographs of the damage in the city were taken from the hotel's second floor balcony. The building was rebuilt, however, and survived into the late 20th century. It was listed as a contributing property to the Meridian Urban Center Historic District in 1979.|$|E
25|$|Other buses {{depart from}} stops on {{surrounding}} streets, {{some of which}} are up to <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the station. The lack of more integrated bus facilities {{has been the subject of}} criticism, particularly due to the fact that the original design for the transport centre included an underground bus station, which was cut from the final design due to costs and the bus operators' preference for above-ground bus facilities. Until early 2016, buses arrived at and departed from Queen Street in front of the station building, but that portion of Queen Street is currently closed to vehicular traffic while trench works for the City Rail Link take place.|$|E
25|$|After the Hudson Yards {{project was}} {{approved}} in 2005, the MTA received {{proceeds from the}} initial 2006 bond offering {{to pay for the}} subway to 34th Street. With funding assured, the MTA proceeded quickly to construction. The subway extension opened on September 13, 2015, and connects to nearby buildings and developments, including 30 Hudson Yards and the Hudson Park and Boulevard. The 34th Street station's main entrance, escalators and an elevator {{on the west side of}} Hudson Park and Boulevard between 33rd and 34th Streets, is at the foot of 55 Hudson Yards and is just half <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the rail yard's northern edge.

25|$|The {{first year}} of {{operation}} showed 21,000 passengers and a profit of NOK41,000. During 1920, there was a strike in the Norwegian State Railways, and Fylkesbilene had to operate a post car on the route from Trondheim via Steinkjer to Sunnan. The company's first head office was at Grand Hotell in Steinkjer, <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the railway station. In 1929, the Nordland Line opened from Sunnan via Snåsa to Grong, and the bus route was terminated. In 1928, the company bought its first buses, a series of 16 and 22-seat vehicles from Strømmens Værksted. Studebakers were introduced in 1937 and Volvos in 1938. A bus terminal and offices {{were built in the}} center of Steinkjer in 1938. In 1938, the route from Steinkjer to Follafoss and from Steinkjer to Sandvollan, Kjerknesvågen and Utøy were opened.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society began {{expanding}} into other financial services, but lost millions {{in its new}} business ventures. In 1992 the bank and its building were seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). That same year the skyscraper was 85 percent vacant, with most business attracted to the larger, more modern office space built in {{the city in the}} 1980s. The FDIC auctioned the building off, and it was bought by developers to turn into a Loews Hotel. The Pennsylvania Convention Center opened in 1993 <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the skyscraper, and the city was promoting the creation of enough hotel space to host a political convention in 2000. Conversion into a hotel began in 1998, and the Loews Philadelphia Hotel opened in April 2000, in time for the 2000 Republican National Convention.|$|E

25|$|By 2012, the Cázares {{claimed the}} Tamaulipas agency had not {{questioned}} potential suspects or eyewitnesses of the kidnapping, nor had they visited the locations {{relevant to the}} case. The Cázares have insisted that authorities should start by investigating the house they were taken following their kidnapping, given that it is located just <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> a busy street in Matamoros. In March 2012, an electricity bill {{was found on the}} door of the premises. The bill showed that the service was used exponentially during the month the family was kidnapped, and that the last time someone paid the bill was on January 2011. A neighbor who lived near the house where the Cázares were held hostage said he did not know who the owners of the property were but did acknowledge seeing suspicious activity during the evenings. On March 7, about 10 months after the mass kidnapping, Gérald Martin, the General Consul of France in Mexico, told the Cázares family that a squadron of Mexico's Federal Police had been dispatched to Matamoros to work directly on the case. The family claims, however, that were not sure if the investigation was actually carried out. They said they did not receive any documents of the investigation. By October 2012, a criminal court in Jalisco under judge Francisco Martín Hernández Zaragoza was assigned to investigate the case. The family claims they do not know the details of the investigation.|$|E
25|$|In 1983 Tenshin Reb Anderson {{received}} shihō from Zentatsu Richard Baker, becoming Baker's first Dharma heir (though Baker disputes this). From 1986 to 1988 {{he served}} as abbot of the San Francisco Zen Center, and from 1988 to 1995 he served there as co-abbot with Sojun Mel Weitsman. Anderson became entangled in an incident in 1987 that reached back to 1983— just after Zentatsu Richard Baker had resigned as abbot. While jogging through Golden Gate Park, Anderson deviated from the path to urinate in some bushes. There he found the corpse {{of a man with}} a bullet wound to the head and a revolver nearby. Rather than report this to the police, Anderson returned to the body over several days to meditate over the corpse. On one visit he decided to take the revolver home with him. Upon his final visit he found the body no longer there, and a fellow priest in whom he had confided showed him a newspaper article covering the apparent suicide. Five years later (in 1988), roughly fifteen months after Anderson had become abbot of the San Francisco, Anderson was arrested for brandishing this same firearm in public. He reported being mugged at knifepoint by a man just <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the San Francisco Zen Center at 300 Page Street. Anderson remembered stowing the revolver away in the San Francisco Zen Center's garage and quickly retrieved it. He then drove after the alleged mugger and followed him into a housing project with the revolver (unloaded) in hand, being arrested minutes later by a police officer with his own gun pointed at him.|$|E
500|$|When Paoli was young, {{his parents}} would often {{take him to}} operas at Ponce's La Perla Theater located <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Paoli's residence.

His parents were very supportive of his ambition and guided him on this route during his youth, enrolling him in a school of [...] "voice" [...] directed by Ramon Marin. His sister Amalia was a soprano who performed at La Perla in Emilio Arrieta's opera, Marina. In 1883, when Paoli was only 12 years old, both his parents died and he went to live in Spain with his sister Amalia.|$|E
