25|$|Azithromycin is an acid-stable antibiotic, {{so it can}} {{be taken}} orally with no need of {{protection}} from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed, but absorption is greater on <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> <b>stomach.</b> Time to peak concentration (Tmax) in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to its high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma due to ion trapping and its high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days.|$|E

40|$|Energy {{balance is}} {{relevant}} to diverse issues in ecology, physiology, and evolution. To determine whether lizards are generally in positive energy balance, we synthesized a massive data set on the proportion of individual lizards (N = 18223) with <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs</b> (127 species), representing nine families distributed on four continents, primarily in temperate zone deserts {{but also in the}} neotropics. The average percentage of individuals with <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs</b> is low (13. 2 %) across all species, even among desert lizards, suggesting that most lizards are in positive energy balance. Nevertheless, species vary substantially in this regard (among all species, 0 % to 66 % of individuals have <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs).</b> Several patterns are detectable among species with unusually high frequencies of <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs.</b> In particular, nocturnal lizards “run on empty” more often on average than do diurnal species (24. 1 % vs. 10. 5 %); and this pattern holds even for nocturnal vs. diurnal geckos (21. 2 % vs. 7. 2 %, respectively). Several (but not all) top predators have a higher frequency of <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs</b> than do species that feed at lower trophic levels. Diet breadth and body size appear unrelated to frequency of <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs.</b> Widely foraging species sometimes have a high frequency of <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs</b> relative to sit-and-wait species, but patterns vary among continents and appear to be confounded by phylogeny and trophic level. Ant-eating specialists have uniformly low frequencies of <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs.</b> Diurnal termite specialists also have low frequencies of <b>empty</b> <b>stomachs,</b> but nocturnal ones have high frequencies.

The sampling campaign covered the semi-lunar, diel and tidal cycles. The density of P. microps and potential hyperbenthic prey {{species in the}} marsh creek, fullness index, evacuation rates and daily ration of common goby were calculated. Mesopodopsis slabberi, Neomysis integer and Corophium volutator were the most dominant prey items in terms of biomass. Numerically, copepods dominated the diet. Migrating fish enter the marsh creek with <b>a</b> relatively <b>empty</b> <b>stomach</b> and leave the marsh with a higher stomach content. Pomatoschistus microps seemed to feed more intensively during the day than the night, however {{the influence of the}} diel cycle is inferior in comparison with the tidal influence on the feeding behaviour of the common goby. A significant difference in foraging activity occurred between the spring and neap tide. The common goby migrated in lower abundance into the creek during spring tide but foraged more intensively. At both spring and neap tide, a significant difference was found in the fullness index between day and night. At spring tide, gobies feed more during the day, while they forage more intensively at night at neap tide. All the three cycles (tidal, diel and semi-lunar) influenced the feeding rhythm of the common goby.

25|$|Anterograde amnesia {{can also}} be caused by alcohol intoxication, a {{phenomenon}} commonly known as a blackout. Studies show rapid rises in blood alcohol concentration over {{a short period of}} time severely impair or in some cases completely block the brain's ability to transfer short-term memories created during the period of intoxication to long-term memory for storage and later retrieval. Such rapid rises are caused by drinking large amounts of alcohol in short periods of time, especially on <b>an</b> <b>empty</b> <b>stomach,</b> as the dilution of alcohol by food slows the absorption of alcohol. Alcohol-related anterograde amnesia is directly related to the rate of consumption of alcohol (and is often associated with binge drinking), and not just the total amount of alcohol consumed in a drinking episode. Test subjects have been found not to experience amnesia when drinking slowly, despite being heavily intoxicated by the end of the experiment. When alcohol is consumed at a rapid rate, the point at which most healthy people's long-term memory creation starts to fail usually occurs at approximately 0.20% BAC, but can be reached as low as 0.14% BAC for inexperienced drinkers. The exact duration of these blackout periods is hard to determine, because most people fall asleep before they end. Upon reaching sobriety, usually after waking, long-term memory creation is completely restored.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Gastric {{tonometry}} is used {{to assess}} gastrointestinal mucosal perfusion in critically ill patients. However, enteral feeding is withheld during monitoring with gastric tonometry because enteral feeding is thought to influence tonometric measurements. • OBJECTIVES To {{examine the effect of}} enteral feeding on the tonometric measurement of gastric mucosal carbon dioxide. • METHODS Gastric tonometers were placed in 20 critically ill patients, and the PCO 2 of the gastric mucosa was measured in both the full and the <b>empty</b> <b>stomach</b> during <b>a</b> 48 -hour period. • RESULTS The PCO 2 measured by the tonometer increased after enteral feeding, and {{a significant difference in the}} PCO 2 of the full versus the <b>empty</b> <b>stomach</b> was evident at 24 and 48 hours. PCO 2 at 4, 24, and 48 hours differed significantly in the full stomach and in the <b>empty</b> <b>stomach.</b> However, the data did not reveal a significant difference in either the full <b>stomach</b> or the <b>empty</b> <b>stomach</b> between PCO 2 at 24 hours and PCO 2 at 48 hours. • CONCLUSION After 24 hours of feeding, the initial increase in PCO 2 observed at 4 hours was not evident, suggesting stabilization of the intragastric environment. However, a higher PCO 2 was evident in the <b>empty</b> <b>stomach,</b> indicating that the presence of the feeding solution may reduce the diffusion of carbon dioxide into the tonometer balloon. Consequently, measurements of intragastric PCO 2 obtained after 24 hours of feeding may be reliable if the <b>stomach</b> is <b>emptied</b> by aspiration via the tonomete...|$|R
