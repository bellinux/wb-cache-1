25|$|Viruses in the Paramyxoviridae {{family are}} also antigenically stable, {{meaning that the}} glycoproteins on the viruses are {{consistent}} between different strains of the same type. There are two reasons for this phenomenon. The first is that the genome is non-segmented and thus cannot undergo genetic reassortment. In order for this process to occur, segments are needed as reassortment happens when segments from different strains are mixed {{together to create a}} new strain. With no segments, nothing can be mixed with one another and so there is no antigenic shift. The second reason relates to the idea of <b>antigenic</b> <b>drift.</b> Since RNA dependent RNA polymerase does not have an error checking function, many mutations are made when the RNA is processed. These mutations build up and eventually new strains are created. Due to this concept, one would expect that paramyxoviruses should not be antigenically stable; however, the opposite is seen to be true. The main hypothesis behind why the viruses are antigenically stable is that each protein and amino acid has an important function. Thus, any mutation would lead to a decrease or total loss of function, which would in turn cause the new virus to be less efficient. These viruses {{would not be able to}} survive as long compared to the more virulent strains, and so would die out.|$|E
500|$|Viruses undergo genetic {{change by}} several mechanisms. These include {{a process called}} <b>antigenic</b> <b>drift</b> where {{individual}} bases in the DNA or RNA mutate to other bases. Most of these point mutations are [...] "silent"– they do not change the protein that the gene encodes– but others can confer evolutionary advantages such as resistance to antiviral drugs. Antigenic shift occurs {{when there is a}} major change in the genome of the virus. This can be a result of recombination or reassortment. When this happens with influenza viruses, pandemics might result. RNA viruses often exist as quasispecies or swarms of viruses of the same species but with slightly different genome nucleoside sequences. Such quasispecies are a prime target for natural selection.|$|E

2500|$|Herd {{immunity}} itself acts as {{an evolutionary}} pressure on certain viruses, influencing viral evolution by encouraging the production of novel strains, in this case referred to as escape mutants, {{that are able to}} [...] "escape" [...] from herd immunity and spread more easily. At the molecular level, viruses escape from herd immunity through <b>antigenic</b> <b>drift,</b> which is when mutations accumulate in the portion of the viral genome that encodes for the virus's surface antigen, typically a protein of the virus capsid, producing a change in the viral epitope. Alternatively, the reassortment of separate viral genome segments, or antigenic shift, which is more common when there are more strains in circulation, can also produce new serotypes. When either of these occur, memory T cells no longer recognize the virus, so herd immunity ceases to be relevant to the dominant circulating strain. For both influenza and norovirus, epidemics temporarily induce herd immunity until a new dominant strain emerges, causing successive waves of epidemics.

40|$|Influenza {{is a very}} {{contagious}} disease that causes serious illness and death every year. <b>Antigenic</b> <b>drifting</b> and <b>antigenic</b> shifting of the virus leads {{to the emergence of}} new viral strains which can evade the human immune system and thus cause epidemics and pandemics. Vaccination is the primary strategy to protect the human population from infections with influenza viruses but the current vaccines do not provide sufficient protection against new strains. Predicting the next pandemic is impossible and therefore it is important to find new vaccines that can induce cross-immune reactivity. The innate immune system targets invading viruses first and activates the adaptive immune response which consists of a humoral and a cellular part. The humoral response can block viral infection with antibodies that can bind viral proteins and the cellular response leads to clearance of the virus with T-cells when a host has been infected. The hemagglutinin surface protein of the virus is currently used as a target for vaccination but because this protein changes rapidly vaccinating against hemagglutinin is ineffective in inducing cross-immune reactivity. The M 2 surface proteins, the internal nucleoprotein and the hemagglutinin stem provide more promisin! g targets for vaccination when a broad immune response is required. The development of a universal influenza vaccine would lead to prevention of pandemic outbreaks. Of all the possible vaccines that are in use or in development DNA vaccines against the nucleoprotein, the M 2 protein or the HA stem, possibly with the addition of an adjuvant, seem like an ideal candidate for a universal vaccine. ...|$|R

40|$|Seasonal {{influenza}} is a {{major public}} health concern, and {{the first line of}} defense is the flu shot. <b>Antigenic</b> <b>drifts</b> and the high rate of influenza transmission require annual updates to the flu shot composition. The World Health Organization recommends which flu strains to include in the annual vaccine based on surveillance and epidemiological analysis. There are two critical decisions regarding the flu shot design. One is its composition; currently, three strains constitute the flu shot, and they influence vaccine effectiveness. Another critical decision is the timing of the composition decisions, which affects the flu shot production. Both of these decisions have to be made under uncertainty many months before the flu season starts. We quantify the trade offs involved through multistage stochastic mixed-integer programs that determine the optimal flu shot composition and its timing in a stochastic and dynamic environment. Our first model takes the view of a social planner, and optimizes strain selections based on a production plan that is provided by the flu shot manufacturers. It also incorporates risk-sensitivity through mean-risk models. Our second model relaxes the exogenous production planning assumption and, hence, provides a more accurate representation of the hierarchical decision mechanism between a social planner, who selects the flu shot strains, and the manufacturers, who make the flu shot available. We derive structural properties of both models, and calibrate them using publicly available data. The flu shot strains are updated based on clinical, virological and immunological surveillance. In the virological surveillance, hemagglutinin inhibition assays are used to identify antigenic properties of the influenza viruses. However, this serology assay is labor-intensive and time-consuming. As an alternative, pairwise amino acid sequence comparison of influenza strains is used in statistical learning models to identify positions that cause antigenic variety. The performance of these models is evaluated by cross validation. In Chapter 5, we formulate cross validation as a bilevel program where an upper-level program chooses the model variables to minimize the out-of-sample error, and lower-level problems in each fold optimize in-sample errors according to their training data set by selecting the regression coefficients of the chosen model variables.
