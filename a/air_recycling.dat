40|$|Domestic solar {{hot water}} units, if {{properly}} designed, {{are capable of}} providing all hot water needs in an environmentally friendly and cost-effective way. Despite 50 years of development, commercial technology has not yet achieved substantial market penetration compared to mainstream electric and gas options. Therefore, alternate designs are warranted if they can offer similar or greater performance for a comparable cost to conventional units. This study proved that such alternatives are possible by designing and testing two novel solar hot water systems (SHWS). The first system used compound parabolic collector (CPC) panels to concentrate solar energy and produce steam. The steam moved from a rooftop downward into a heat exchange pipe within a ground level water tank, heating the water, condensing and falling into a receptacle. The operation was entirely passive, since the condensate was pulled up due to the partial vacuum that occurred after system cooling. Efficiencies of up to 40 % were obtained. The second system used an air heater panel. Air was circulated in open and closed loop configuration (<b>air</b> <b>recycling)</b> {{by means of a}} fan/blower motor and was forced across a compact heat exchanger coupled to a water tank. This produced a natural thermosiphon flow heating the water. <b>Air</b> <b>recycling</b> mode provided higher system efficiencies: 34 % vs. 27 %. The concurrent development of an analytical model that reasonably predicted heat transfer dynamics of these systems allowed 1) performance optimisation for specific input/starting operating conditions and 2) virtual design improvements. The merit of this model lay in its acceptable accuracy in spite of its simplicity. By optimising for operating conditions and parameter design, both systems are capable of providing over 30 MJ of useful domestic hot water on clear days, which equates roughly to an increase of 35 °C in a 200 L water tank. This will satisfy, on average, daily hot water requirements for a 4 -person household, particularly in low-latitude regions (eg. Queensland). Preliminary costing for these systems puts them on par with conventional units, with the passive, remotely coupled, low maintenance, CPC SHWS comparable to higher end models. The air heater SHWS, by contrast, was much more economical and easier to build and handle, but at the trade-off cost of 1) the need for an active system, 2) increased maintenance and running costs and 3) the requirement for a temperature control mechanism that would protect the panel body by dumping hot air trapped inside if stagnation were to occur...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBaghouse dust {{collectors}} {{are widely used}} to removewood particles fromdust-laden air before it is expelled from or recycled intoworkplaces. Despite the growing use of filter media with supplementary surface treatment, conventional open-faced filter media or other common media are still widely used in the woodworking industry. More efficient filter media may help to reduce downstreamparticle emission. This article describes the emission performances of two polyester fiber filter media: one with a smooth anti-adhesive thermo-bonded surface, and the second covered with a microporous polymeric membrane. For the two media, 250 filtration cycles were performed on a 24 -bag pulse-jet cleaned pilot dust collector loadedwith coarsewood dust from a joinery workshop. Emitted particle concentrations and downstream particle size distributionswere measured for various operating conditions. The data presented focus on particle puffs emitted during pulse-jet cleaning as this {{is known to be}} the most problematic stage. For both media, our results confirm the prevailing opinion that higher pulse-jet cleaning intensities increase particle emission, however this also reduces regeneration frequency. Increasing the maximum pressure drop across the filter bags before regeneration leads to higher average downstream mass concentrations during pulse-jet cleaning. The wood particles emitted during puffs are predominantly sub-microbic. For all operating conditions, the medium with a polymeric membrane was associated with lower particle emissions than the more commonly used thermo-bonded medium. However, during pulse-jet cleaning, neither of the media tested provided a mass concentration below 0. 2 mg*m− 3, the recommended concentration value for <b>air</b> <b>recycling</b> in France...|$|E
40|$|We {{carried out}} a survey in 16 {{libraries}} of the University of Modena, Northern Italy, to assess the indoor exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including formaldehyde, and total dusts. Data were collected on the main structural characteristics of the buildings; indoor microclimate parameters, such as temperature, relative humidity and ventilation rate were measured and air samples taken {{inside and outside the}} libraries. The mean value of total dusts was 190 +/- 130 mu g/m(3) {{with a wide range of}} values. Formaldehyde was found in only ten out of 16 libraries and the indoor concentrations ranged from 1. 70 to 67. 8 mu g/m(3) with an average value of 32. 7 +/- 23. 9 mu g/m(3). On the whole, VOCs were present in all the libraries investigated with an average value was 433 +/- 267 mu g/m(3) (range 102 - 936 mu g/m(3)). No correlation was found among VOCs, formaldehyde and total dusts nor was a significant association observed with microclimatic parameters or the structural characteristics of the buildings. The general situation found in this study suggests no major problems related to indoor pollution.

The winter garden has an <b>air</b> <b>recycling</b> system; moreover, plants can absorb carbon dioxide and generate oxygen. The air saturated with carbon dioxide is removed from the premises of the office building into the winter garden; there, it contacts plant leaves; thus, the air is purified and saturated with oxygen.

The temperature and relative humidity of the air leaving the winter garden are usually above the desired values for a person on the premises of the office building; therefore, they need to be cooled and drained. The temperature and relative humidity of the air delivered from the office building to the winter garden are usually below the values needed for winter garden plants, and they need heating and humidification.
