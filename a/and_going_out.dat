Over the next few years he had numerous love affairs, and was prevented from a love marriage with one Esther Raizel because his own dubious reputation compounded the taint of his mother's divorce. He survived another pogrom, but his family was financially ruined by the destruction of their possessions and the theft of their money.|$|E
5|$|From 1972 to 2006, {{dramatic}} reductions {{continued in}} the number of feral honey bees in the U.S. and a significant though somewhat gradual decline {{in the number of}} colonies maintained by beekeepers. This decline includes the cumulative losses from all factors, such as urbanization, pesticide use, tracheal and Varroa mites, and commercial beekeepers' retiring <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> of business. However, in late 2006 and early 2007, the rate of attrition was alleged to have reached new proportions, and people began to use the term colony collapse disorder to describe this sudden rash of disappearances (or sometimes spontaneous hive collapse or the Mary Celeste syndrome in the United Kingdom).|$|E

Nowadays, American pop culture has a heavy hold on the Filipinos that evolved from the Spanish times when the American occupation happened. Along with Korean pop, these two are dominating the recent music scene in media.

The first day of the month is marked by opening the gate of a temple, symbolizing the gates of hell. On the twelfth day, lamps on the main altar are lit. On the thirteenth day, a procession of lanterns is held. On the fourteenth day, a parade is held for releasing water lanterns. Incense and food are offered to the spirits to deter them from visiting homes and spirit paper money is also burnt as an offering. During the month, people avoid surgery, buying cars, swimming, moving house, marrying, whistling <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> or taking pictures after dark. It is also important that addresses are not revealed to the ghosts.|$|E
25|$|In 1704 a {{group of}} farmers in Hurley petitioned the colonial governor, Viscount Cornbury, {{for some of the}} undeveloped land to their west along the creek to use as common pasture and firewood, since they were getting {{squeezed}} by Kingston to their east and Marbletown to the south. The petition was put off for several years while it was ostensibly being surveyed, and in 1706 a grant of 2million acres (8,000km2) was made to Johannes Hardenbergh and {{a group of}} investors starting from the same point along the Esopus near Kingston <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> to the Delaware River, taking not only all of Ulster County to the west but much of today's Delaware and Sullivan counties as well. The Hardenbugh Patent, as it became known, is the source of much of the land titles in the Catskills today, although its legitimacy was contested from the beginning, a dispute which continued until after the Revolution, aggravated by inadequate surveys of the region. Encumbrances remained on many properties into the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|At the 1973 US Open, Evert {{started off}} hot {{by winning the}} first two games, but Court quickly stormed back to win the next five games, which allowed her to fend off Evert in a narrow win of the first set 57. Evert made many passing shots against Court in the second set, which was due to poor tactics by her {{opponent}} by coming into net, and this made Court’s error total go up allowing Evert to string together five straight games in a 62 set. Conversely, Court {{went back to the}} game plan she used to win the first set in the final and decisive third set. During the set Court won the first game and Evert took the next, which Court would win three games in a row breaking Evert’s serve in the four game <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> to a lead of 41, which during one game in the Court fell behind 1540, but would get lucky when Evert missed a smash and the next point was won by Court win an ace.

The story was originally conceptualized as a television series entitled The Hive (a reference to the constant calls and conversations sounding like bees buzzing), but D'Ovidio decided to redraft it as a film on realizing that [...] "the operators couldn't be the ones kicking in doors <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> into the field" [...] all the time.

[...] Whereas a lot of rock and roll isn't even entertaining at all, let alone allowing people the voice for expression. [...] That's what the Make-Up has come to remedy. [...] We want to be at once entertaining and inclusive in terms of using the gospel form to sort of breathe life into the old Frankenstein monster".

The team's opening match in the Champions League proper on 13 September 2016 proved to be a humbling experience though as Barcelona delivered a footballing lesson in a 70 rout; the club's heaviest ever European defeat and the second heaviest in the club's history. A level of pride was restored in the next Champions League tie, Celtic holding Manchester City to a 33 draw at Celtic Park, with new signing Moussa Dembélé scoring twice, and ending the high-spending English club's run of 10 consecutive wins.

[...] Television critic Robin Pierson noted that in the episode, [...] "The Jim and Pam relationship begins to take real shape here." [...] He later called the moment when Roy nearly attacks Jim as [...] "a much more 'real' moment {{that the rest of the}} episode."

500|$|The episode {{received}} varied {{reviews from}} critics and viewers. Reviewers generally disliked the episode's humor, but were {{positive about the}} more serious moments. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club believed that the show's concept, which allowed only two characters and a single scene, was [...] "ambitious" [...] but that the end result was [...] "flaccid." [...] He commented that with no cut-away gags or side plots, the episode was [...] "basically everything critics of the show would like the show to have" [...] but was deprived of Family Guys trademark fast pace and reduced to [...] "a series of what amounts to grossout comedy sketches." [...] Television critic Ramsey Isler of IGN added that the gross-out humor [...] "didn't work for me" [...] and found the [...] "more serious stuff" [...] in the episode {{to be the most}} entertaining. Said Isler, [...] "the addition of more dramatic themes and the elimination of the cutaway gags really showed what this show could be if Seth [...] and team put more effort in." [...] In a subsequent review of Family Guys eighth season, Isler listed [...] "Brian & Stewie" [...] as being [...] "surprisingly dramatic," [...] and, [...] "had {{it not been for the}} extended poop-eating jokes and rehashed musical numbers in the second half, I'd say it was one of the better efforts the show has ever put out." [...] Jason Hughes of TV Squad was also [...] "more than a little disturbed" [...] by the amount of time spent on Stewie's soiled diaper. However, he noted, [...] "I didn't laugh much at 'Brian & Stewie', but I found myself absolutely captured by their discussion throughout the episode." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described the episode as [...] "tedious, predictably vulgar, and, by the end, sentimental." [...] Adam Rosenberg of MTV wrote, [...] "Beneath all of the more disturbing elements there's actually some very thoughtful, mature discussion of suicide and what love means amidst it all." [...] Andrew Hanson of The Los Angeles Times found the soiled diaper gag [...] "too sick to watch" [...] and [...] "the grossest" [...] moment featured in Family Guy so far, but conceded that that may have been the producer's intention. Still, Hanson described Brian's suicidal confession as [...] "deep" [...] and stated, [...] "It’s nice to see that Family Guy is still trying new things <b>and</b> <b>going</b> <b>out</b> on a limb even at episode No. 150." [...] Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number seven on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and said he [...] "loved" [...] this episode due its feature of Brian and Stewie's relationship. He added that the episode was [...] "particularly great" [...] because it featured no cutaway gags and was a two-hander, noting that [...] "Clearly, the writers know exactly what the fans want." ...|$|E
