2500|$|In the Greco–Iberian alphabet, {{used during}} the 4th century BC in eastern Spain to write the Iberian {{language}} (a language unrelated to Greek), sampi was adopted {{along with the rest}} of the Ionian Greek alphabet, as an <b>alphabetic</b> <b>character</b> to write a second sibilant sound distinct from sigma.

2500|$|The {{subroutine}} {{establishes a}} call frame using register A6 as the frame pointer. This kind of calling convention supports reentrant and recursive code and is typically used by languages like C and C++. The subroutine then retrieves the parameters passed to it ( [...] and [...] ) from the stack. It then loops, reading an ASCII character (a single byte) from the [...] string, checking {{whether it is}} an <b>alphabetic</b> <b>character,</b> and if so, converting it into a lower-case character, then writing the character into the [...] string. Finally, it checks whether the character was a null character; if not, it repeats the loop, otherwise it restores the previous stack frame (and A6 register) and returns. Note that the string pointers (registers A0 and A1) are auto-incremented in each iteration of the loop.|$|E
50|$|The {{general format}} of the Monitoring Station Designators was the <b>alphabetic</b> <b>characters</b> MS {{followed}} by one or two numeric <b>characters.</b> Typically the <b>alphabetic</b> <b>characters</b> and numeric character(s) were separated by a dash character.|$|R

2500|$|Small {{differences}} in graphical representation are also problematic when they affect legibility or {{belong to the}} wrong cultural tradition. Besides making some Unicode fonts unusable for texts involving multiple [...] "Unihan languages", names or other orthographically sensitive terminology might be displayed incorrectly. (Proper names tend to be especially orthographically conservative—compare this to changing the spelling of one's name to suit a language reform in the US or UK) While this may be considered primarily a graphical representation or rendering problem to be overcome by more artful fonts, {{the widespread use of}} Unicode would make it difficult to preserve such distinctions. The problem of one character representing semantically different concepts is also present in the Latin part of Unicode. The Unicode character for an apostrophe {{is the same as the}} character for a right single quote (’). On the other hand, the capital Latin letter [...] "A" [...] is not unified with the Greek letter [...] "Α" [...] (Alpha). This is, of course, desirable for reasons of compatibility, and deals with a much smaller <b>alphabetic</b> <b>character</b> set.|$|E
2500|$|Some Ionian cities used {{a special}} letter , alphabetically ordered behind Ω, for a {{sibilant}} sound in positions where other dialects had either ΣΣ or ΤΤ (e.g. [...] "" [...] 'four', cf. normal spelling Ionic [...] "" [...] vs. Attic [...] ). This symbol later {{dropped out of}} alphabetic use, but survived {{in the form of}} the numeral symbol sampi (modern [...] "ϡ"). As an <b>alphabetic</b> <b>character,</b> it has been attested in the cities of Miletus, Ephesos, Halikarnassos, Erythrae, Teos (all situated in the region of Ionia in Asia Minor), in the island of Samos, in the Ionian colony of Massilia, and in Kyzikos (situated farther north in Asia Minor, in the region of Mysia). In Pontic Mesembria, on the Black Sea coast of Thrace, it was used on coins, which were marked with the abbreviation of the city's name, spelled [...] "". The sound denoted by this letter was a reflex of the proto-Greek consonant clusters [...] or , and was probably an intermediate sound during the phonetic change from the earlier plosive clusters towards the later [...] sound, possibly an affricate similar to [...]|$|E

Although fonts claiming Unicode coverage will contain glyphs for dingbats in addition to <b>alphabetic</b> <b>characters,</b> fonts that have dingbats in place of <b>alphabetic</b> <b>characters</b> continue to be popular, primarily for ease of input.

50|$|Similarly, in {{computer}} science, a variable {{is a name}} (commonly an <b>alphabetic</b> <b>character</b> or a word) representing some value represented {{in computer}} memory.

50|$|The {{format of}} the PPS number was defined as being nine {{characters}} in length, consisting of 7 digits in positions 1 to 7, followed by a check character in position 8, with either a space or the letter “W” in position 9.

50|$|Significant {{conditions}} are recognized by an appropriate device called a receiver, demodulator, or decoder. The decoder translates the actual signal received into its intended logical value {{such as a}} binary digit (0 or 1), an <b>alphabetic</b> <b>character,</b> a mark, or a space. Each significant instant is determined when the appropriate device assumes a condition or state usable for performing a specific function, such as recording, processing, or gating.|$|E

25|$|Non-stenographic systems often {{supplement}} <b>alphabetic</b> <b>characters</b> {{by using}} punctuation marks as additional characters, giving special significance to capitalised letters, and sometimes using additional non-alphabetic symbols.

However, {{there are some}} pure alphabetic systems, including Personal Shorthand, SuperWrite, Easy Script Speed Writing and Keyscript Shorthand which limit their symbols to a priori <b>alphabetic</b> <b>characters.</b> These have the added advantage that {{they can also be}} typed—for instance, onto a computer, PDA, or cellphone. Early editions of Speedwriting were also adapted so that they could be written on a typewriter, and therefore would possess the same advantage.|$|R
