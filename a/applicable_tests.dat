50|$|In {{terms of}} {{political}} psychology motivation {{is viewed as}} goal-oriented behavior driven by a need for three things; power, affiliation intimacy, and achievement. These categories were grouped by Winter (1996) from Murray's (1938) twenty suggested common human goals. Need for power affects the style in which a leader performs. Winter and Stewart (1977) suggested that leaders high in power motivation and low in need of affiliation intimacy motivation make better presidents. Affiliation-motivated leaders alternatively tend to collaborate joint efforts {{in the absence of}} threat. Lastly, achievement motivation has demonstrated to not correspond with political success, especially if it is higher than power motivation (Winter, 2002). Motivation between a leader and those whom they are ruling needs to be consistent with success. Motives {{have been shown to be}} correlated more highly with situation and time since last goal-fulfillment, rather than consistent traits. The Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) is commonly used for assessing motives.

40|$|Abstract: Lung {{cancer is}} one of the {{malignancies}} causing deaths worldwide. The yet to be developed non-invasive diag-nostic techniques, are a challenge for early detection of cancer before it progresses to its later stages. The currently avail-able diagnostic methods are expensive or invasive, and are not fit for general screening purposes. Early identification not only helps in detecting primary cancer, but also in treating its secondaries; which creates a need for easily <b>applicable</b> <b>tests</b> to screen individuals at risk. A detailed review of the various screening methods, including the latest trend of breath analysis using gold nanoparticles, to identify cancer at its early stage, are studied here. The VOC based breath biomarkers are used to analyze the exhaled breath of the patients. These biomarkers are utilized by Chemiresistors coated with gold nanoparticles, which are found to be the most suited technique for early detection of lung cancer. This technique is highly accurate and is relatively easy to operate and was tested on smokers and non-smokers. This review also gives as an outline of the fabrication and working of the device Na-Nose. The Chemiresistors coated with Gold nanoparticles, show a great potential in being an non-invasive and cost-effective diagnostic technique for early detection of lung cancer...|$|E

Early and accurate diagnosis of Babesia spp. infection {{plays an important role in}} treatment and control. The current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Loop-Mediated Isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay as a new molecular technique used for diagnosis of bovine babesiosis in naturally infected cattle. The confirmation of this infection was depended on blood smears, LAMP and Nested-Polymerase chain Reaction (nPCR) assays, which confirmed the infection in 19 %, 47. 62 % and 52. 38 % of the examined animals, respectively. Tick samples were collected and identified as Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus, which is the vector of Babesia spp. Evaluation of blood smears and LAMP assay was carried out against nPCR as a reference test.

40|$|Early {{diagnosis}} {{of lung cancer}} results in improved survival compared to diagnosis with more advanced disease. Early disease is not reliably indicated by symptoms. Because investigations such as bronchoscopy and needle biopsy have associated risks and substantial costs, they are not suitable for population screening. Hence new easily <b>applicable</b> <b>tests,</b> {{which can be used}} to screen individuals at risk, are required. Biomarker testing in exhaled breath samples is a simple, relatively inexpensive, non-invasive approach. Exhaled breath contains volatile and non-volatile organic compounds produced as end-products of metabolic processes and the composition of such compounds varies between healthy subjects and subjects with lung cancer. Many studies have analysed the patterns of these compounds in exhaled breath. In addition studies have also reported that the exhaled breath condensate (EBC) can reveal gene mutations or DNA abnormalities in patients with lung cancer. This review has summarised the scientific evidence demonstrating that lung cancer has distinct chemical profiles in exhaled breath and characteristic genetic changes in EBC. It is not yet possible to accurately identify individuals with lung cancer in at risk populations by any of these techniques. However, analysis of both volatile organic compounds in exhaled breath and of EBC have great potential to become clinically useful diagnostic and screening tools for early stage lung cancer detection...|$|E
