5|$|During {{her first}} {{appearances}} as {{a figment of}} Newt's imagination, Rae was depicted as a goth with an emo persona. When she was reintroduced as a real person, Rae's character was more reminiscent {{to that of a}} chav. The character later underwent a transitional period; she retained her strong personality, but displayed a weaker side resulting from the setbacks she encountered. Barlow found the role challenging, as her own personality is dissimilar from her character's. She described Rae as someone who <b>always</b> <b>makes</b> her opinion known, and hoped she would be remembered for her strong-willed persona.|$|E
5|$|In the Dunphy household, Alex (Ariel Winter) and Haley (Sarah Hyland) {{are furious}} at Manny (Rico Rodriguez) and Luke (Nolan Gould) for barging into their room {{while they were}} changing. This leads to their mother, Claire (Julie Bowen) to yell at them, while their dad, Phil (Ty Burrell) {{attempts}} to push himself away from Claire's anger behind her back. Annoyed, Claire confronts Phil about how he <b>always</b> <b>makes</b> her play the 'bad cop' role in their family and keeps the 'good cop' role for himself. He reluctantly agrees to switch roles with her. Claire takes Manny and Luke go-carting (although Phil had been quite keen to go), while Phil has to stay and make the girls clean their bathroom. The go-carting goes horribly as Claire, trying to be fun, crashes her cart into the boys, and makes them order large quantities of food. While driving home, Luke gets sick from drinking a milkshake he did not want. Meanwhile, Phil goes berserk when the girls lie to him about cleaning the bathroom and jump on their car {{to stop them from}} leaving, before forcing them to clean the bathroom under his direct supervision and then he had them clean his bathroom. That evening, Phil and Claire admit that they cannot handle each other's natural parent roles, and agree to go back to normal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} {{after the death of}} Augustus, the Roman Empire was, in a sense, a union of inchoate principalities, which could have {{disintegrated}} at any time. In 68 AD, Ser. Sulpicius Galba, the governor of Hispania Tarraconensis, was proclaimed Emperor by his troops. In Rome, the emperor Nero quickly lost his supporters and committed suicide. The governor of Lower Germany, A. Vitellius, was soon proclaimed Emperor by his troops, and in Rome, the Praetorian Guard proclaimed M. Salvius Otho Emperor. In 69, Galba was assassinated and Otho took an army to Germany to defeat Vitellius, but instead was himself defeated. He committed suicide, and Vitellius was proclaimed Emperor, but was quickly defeated and the executed by Vespasian, who was then declared Emperor. Under the Emperor Vespasian, the Roman constitution began a slide toward outright monarchy. Vespasian died in 79, and was succeeded by his son, Titus, who presided over a further weakening of the senate. He was succeeded by his brother, Domitian, in 81. Domitian's reign marked a significant turning point on the road to monarchy, as he made himself Censor for life, and unlike his father, used these powers to further subjugate the Senate. Domitian, ultimately, was a tyrant with the character which <b>always</b> <b>makes</b> tyranny repulsive, and this derived in part from his own paranoia, which itself was a consequence {{of the fact that he}} had no son, and thus no obvious heir. In September 96, Domitian was assassinated.|$|E

25|$|It {{follows from}} the second law of {{thermodynamics}} that the entropy {{of a system that}} is not isolated may decrease. An air conditioner, for example, may cool the air in a room, thus reducing the entropy of the air of that system. The heat expelled from the room (the system), which the air conditioner transports and discharges to the outside air, <b>always</b> <b>makes</b> a bigger contribution to the entropy of the environment than the decrease of the entropy of the air of that system. Thus, the total of entropy of the room plus the entropy of the environment increases, in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics.|$|E

As soon as the shell has cooled enough, skilful hands take it, smooth and polish it, and finish it to perfection. But it was dangerous work, and the hospital had a steady stream of ‘work-wounded’ to deal with, some minor, some much more serious. As an example, here is part of the story of one man.|$|E

25|$|Domitian's reign {{marked a}} {{significant}} turning {{point on the}} road to monarchy. After making himself Consul for ten years, Domitian made himself Censor for life, and unlike his father, he used these powers to further subjugate the senate by controlling its membership. He also changed the law so that he could preside over capital trials against senators. The manner in which he was able to dominate his Consular colleagues helped to further illustrate the powerlessness of the Consulship. To reduce the risk of an armed uprising against him, Domitian ensured that no single general could command more than two legions at once. Domitian did, however, divide the empire into smaller administrative units. This system was quite efficient, and was revived two centuries later by the emperor Diocletian. Domitian, ultimately, was a tyrant with the character which <b>always</b> <b>makes</b> tyranny repulsive, and this derived in part from his own paranoia. Since he had no son, and thus no obvious heir, he was constantly in danger of being overthrown. Thus, the unresolved issue of succession again proved to be deadly, and in September 96, Domitian was murdered.|$|E

Writing again in 1991, Furnas suggested potential Dooley targets might include the Bork and Souter confirmation hearings, and the omnipresence of blue jeans; but that an impediment to a revival of interest in Dooley was the present-day view of dialect works as demeaning. English professor John W. Lowe stated that Dooley [...] "set the model for an ethnic spokesman who could be entertaining and informative {{at the same time}} using humor to mask a subversive form of humor and get a message across. Then, the Irish made it, and they found his brogue and dialect embarrassing." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Man in the Blue Flannel Pants" [...] {{was written}} by Jeff Westbrook and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore. It featured John Slattery, Matthew Weiner, and Kevin Michael Richardson as guest voices. Weiner is the creator, writer, and showrunner of the television show Mad Men, in which Slattery portrays the character Roger Sterling. The entire A-Plot of the episode was a parody of Mad Men. Homer transforms into the lead character from Mad Men, Don Draper, and Slattery's character Robert Marlowe shares similarities with Roger Sterling. Weiner's role in the episode was a brief cameo {{as one of the}} businessmen on the rafting trip with Mr. Burns. The lead actor of Mad Men, Jon Hamm, did not appear in the episode, but previously appeared in the season 22 episode [...] "Donnie Fatso" [...] as a different character. [...] "The Man in the Blue Flannel Pants" [...] even recreated a scene from Mad Men, in which a lawnmower runs loose in an office.

She asks for others' opinions before giving it to Jim, but most of them give her harsh critiques. Jim gives Pam a beautiful bracelet and he is equally amazed at the comic book she gives him. Meanwhile, Jim agrees to a snowball fight with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). When he is first challenged outside, however, he finds the doors chained. Dwight then emerges from a snowman, throwing multiple snowballs at Jim and leaving him with a bloody nose. Throughout the day, Dwight torments Jim with increasingly elaborate snowball ambushes. Jim tries to surrender, but Dwight refuses. At the end of the day, Jim is too afraid to go outside. He and Pam find multiple snowmen, and Jim attacks them all hoping to find Dwight. Dwight, however, is {{on the roof of the}} building, watching Jim with a satisfied look on his face. He claims that the most powerful snowball in a snowball fight is fear, and smilingly wishes the camera [...] "Merry Christmas".|$|E

[...] Gordon says that she feels Martha <b>always</b> <b>makes</b> bad choices when it comes to her love life, because she never knows what she wants. Gordon said that Martha is [...] "messed up" [...] but with a [...] "warm side" [...] to her persona, and that overall Martha is [...] "fun loving, easy going girl-next-door" [...] type character. Of her portrayal, Gordon says that she enjoys the challenge of playing Martha because she gets to shout a lot when showing her crazy and fun side. Gordon later said that [...] "There will always {{be a little bit of}} trouble attached to Martha. She will always be a little bit mischievous". On the character's appearance, RTÉ said [...] "Martha was a self-confessed tomboy, loving sport and anything physical.

In an interview with FIFA.com just before the 2012 Olympics, she alluded to the comparison, saying, [...] "Zidane is {{a role model for}} me. He was always the player that I most enjoyed watching. The comparison was made frequently when I was starting out, and now, as the years pass, it happens less and less often. But I wouldn't say I’m tired of it." [...] She often attempts to downplay the comparison, though, stating [...] "Being compared to Zidane is really nice, but I don’t think it can harm me because I’ve been hearing it since I was very young. It <b>always</b> <b>makes</b> me proud, but as I always say, I don’t think you can compare anyone to him. He’s unique". While training at the Clairefontaine academy in 2004, Nécib met Zidane, who was at the training center in preparation for qualifying for the 2006 World Cup (the finals would eventually be his last act as a professional).

500|$|Teaching {{was one of}} the few careers {{then open}} to educated working-class girls, and in 1906 Ellen won a bursary of £25 that enabled her to begin her training. For half the week she {{attended}} the Manchester Day Training College, and during the other half taught at Oswald Road Elementary School. Her classroom approach—she sought to interest her pupils, rather than impose learning by rote—led to frequent clashes with her superiors, and convinced her that her future did not lie in teaching. At the college, where she was encouraged to read more widely and to engage with the issues of the day, she discovered socialism through the works of Robert Blatchford. By this time she was impatient with religion; socialism provided a timely and attractive substitute. At 16 she joined the Longsight branch of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and at one of her first branch meetings encountered Katherine Bruce Glasier, whose crusading brand of socialism made a deep impact. Thirty years later Wilkinson told her colleague George Middleton that Glasier had [...] "brought me into the Socialist movement... It <b>always</b> <b>makes</b> me humble to think of her indomitable courage". After meeting the suffragist Hannah Mitchell, Wilkinson took up the cause of women's suffrage, the major women's rights issue of the day. Although initially engaged in everyday tasks such as distributing leaflets and putting up posters, she made a considerable impression on Mitchell, who later remembered her as [...] "brilliant and gifted".|$|E

[...] "Though it’s no 'When Love Takes Over', Kelly Rowland’s latest single and music video 'Rose Colored Glasses' isn’t half-bad.

[...] Mack from Sound-Savvy said, [...] "Kelly <b>always</b> <b>makes</b> those love songs that make you re-examine things...While I don’t think Rose Colored Glasses will impact as hard as Commander, it's a formidable single in its own right and I kinda like it."
