5|$|Her {{journeys}} {{into the}} land of slavery put her at tremendous risk, and she {{used a variety of}} subterfuges to avoid detection. Tubman once disguised herself with a bonnet and carried two live chickens to give the appearance of running errands. Suddenly finding herself walking toward a former owner in Dorchester County, she yanked the strings holding the birds' legs, and their agitation allowed her to avoid eye contact. Later she recognized a fellow train passenger as another former master; she snatched a nearby newspaper <b>and</b> <b>pretended</b> to read. Since Tubman was known to be illiterate, the man ignored her.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{budget was}} so small that during the 32 days of {{shooting}} in Eugene, mostly in November, Landis had no trailer or office and could not watch dailies for three weeks. His wife Deborah Nadoolman purchased most of the costumes at local thrift stores, and she and Judy Belushi made the party togas. Landis and Bruce McGill staged a scene for reporters visiting the set where the director pretended to be angry at the actor for being difficult on the set. Landis grabbed a breakaway pitcher and smashed it over McGill's head. He {{fell to the ground}} <b>and</b> <b>pretended</b> to be unconscious. The reporters were completely fooled, and when Landis asked McGill to get up, he refused to move.|$|E

40|$|Play is an {{important}} part of early learning and development. It is central in the Early Years Foundation Stage, with exploration and imagination included as specific learning goals (Department for Education, 2014). Humour <b>and</b> <b>pretending</b> are two forms of play which have the potential to encourage exploration and imagination. Humour, at its most basic, involves enjoying something done wrong, e. g., putting a sock on one’s hand (Hoicka & Gattis, 2008; Hoicka, Jutsum, & Gattis, 2008). In contrast, pretending involves something technically wrong, but right in one’s imagination (Nichols & Stich, 2003). For instance, one could imagine the sock is a mitten. This article will discuss: 1. types of humour <b>and</b> <b>pretending</b> in infancy through 3 year; 2. how social factors influence humour and pretending; 3. humour <b>and</b> <b>pretending</b> in developmental disorders; and 4. differences in humour <b>and</b> <b>pretending...</b>|$|R

25|$|Crystal {{also was}} well known for his {{impressions}} of Yankee Hall of Famer turned broadcaster Phil Rizzuto. Rizzuto, known for his quirks calling games, did not travel to Anaheim, California in 1996 to call the game for WPIX. Instead, Crystal joined the broadcasters in the booth <b>and</b> <b>pretended</b> to be Rizzuto {{for a few minutes}} during the August 31 game.|$|E
25|$|The {{numerous}} {{laws against}} pagans {{seems to have}} had only limited immediate effect in stamping out the old religion. Many people simply conformed outwardly <b>and</b> <b>pretended</b> to become Christian while secretly continuing to practice their beliefs. The numerous laws against apostasy, that had been continuously promulgated since the time of Gratian and Theodosius, is evidence that the emperors were having a hard time even keeping Christians from going astray.|$|E

Despite advocacy from Mike Fulton, Chillings placed Punky with a new foster family: the fabulously wealthy Jules and Tiffany Buckworth (Robert Casper and Joan Welles), the latter of whom did not take kindly at all to Punky's working-class playfulness. Things gradually returned to normal: Henry, {{back on his feet}} following surgery, opened up a glitzy new studio at the local mall; in the process, he reunited with Punky. At the conclusion of the story arc, Henry officially adopted Punky.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} Owen's {{tactical}} mind {{was seen in}} one of his early international matches against England in 1902. Wales were behind in the game with little time remaining when Owen tricked his opposite number, Bernard Oughtred, into an off-side tackle near the English posts. With the Welsh in charge of the scrum on the English '25', Owen told his forwards, in Welsh, to keep hold of the ball, while Owen bent down <b>and</b> <b>pretended</b> to collect it. Oughtred came around the scrum to tackle Owen and finding the Welshman empty handed was penalised for being off-side. John Strand-Jones kicked the penalty, allowing Wales to win 9-8.|$|E
25|$|Artemisia was {{surrounded}} mainly {{by the presence}} of males since the loss of her mother at age 12. When Artemisia was 17, Orazio rented the upstairs apartment of their home to a female tenant, Tuzia. Artemisia befriended Tuzia; however, Tuzia allowed Agostino Tassi and Cosimo Quorlis to accompany Artemisia in Artemisia's home on multiple occasions. The day the rape occurred, Artemisia cried for the help of Tuzia, but Tuzia simply ignored Artemisia <b>and</b> <b>pretended</b> she knew nothing of what happened. Artemisia felt betrayed by Tuzia, and because Tuzia was the only female figure in her life, Artemisia's works contained a strong sense of the importance of solidarity and unity between women.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the family}} was happy in Lorch, Schiller's father found his work unsatisfying. He {{sometimes}} took his son with him. In Lorch, Schiller received his primary education. The quality of the lessons was fairly bad, and Friedrich regularly cut class with his older sister. Because his parents wanted Schiller to become a pastor, they had the pastor of the village instruct the boy in Latin and Greek. Pastor Moser was a good teacher, and later Schiller named the cleric in his first play Die Räuber (The Robbers) after him. As a boy, Schiller was excited {{by the idea of}} becoming a cleric and often put on black robes <b>and</b> <b>pretended</b> to preach.|$|E
25|$|The {{leader of}} the Transylvanian noblemen who had fled to the Ottoman Empire, Gabriel Bethlen, {{sent a letter to}} Bocskai urging him to rise up against Rudolph, but Bocskai refused. To award Bocskai for his loyalty, Rudolph {{restored}} to him almost all his estates in Transylvania proper on 2July 1604. Bocskai visited Transylvania and realized that the towns and villages had almost completely been destroyed during the previous years. On his way back from Transylvania, on 20September he learnt that Hajdús had seized a letter about his alleged correspondence with the Grand Vizier, Lala Mehmed Pasha, from Gabriel Bethlen. Fearing reprisals, Bocskai hurried to Sólyomkő <b>and</b> <b>pretended</b> that gout had paralysed him. Actually, he ordered his castellans to make preparations for resistance, but one of them revealed Bocskai's plans to Cipriano Concini, the deputy captain of Várad.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} cliff path where Nofret and Satipy died, Renisenb, {{apparently}} summoned by Hori, hears footsteps {{behind her and}} turns to see Yahmose. She then sees the look of murderous hatred in her brother's eyes that the other women saw before they were killed. On the brink of her own death, she realises that Satipy was not looking in fear at anything beyond Yahmose — she was looking straight at him. He had consumed a non-lethal dose of poison <b>and</b> <b>pretended</b> to recuperate while committing murders, both to make himself chief heir and to indulge his newfound love of violence. As Renisenb realises some of this, Hori slays Yahmose with an arrow and saves her. Hori explains all. Renisenb's final choice is whom to marry: Kameni, a lively husband not unlike her first, or Hori, an older and more enigmatic figure. She makes her choice and falls into Hori’s arms.|$|E

25|$|When Emperor Ling became {{critically}} ill in 189, he secretly entrusted an eight-year-old Liu Xie {{to a close}} aide and eunuch, Jian Shuo. Upon Emperor Ling's death, Jian Shuo attempted to lure He Jin into a trap in the palace, assassinate him, and then install Liu Xie on the throne. However, Pan Yin (潘隱), a eunuch who was also an acquaintance of He Jin, warned the General-in-Chief of Jian Shuo's plot. He Jin returned to his military camp <b>and</b> <b>pretended</b> to be sick so {{he did not need}} to respond when summoned to enter the palace. Jian Shuo's plan to make Liu Xie emperor failed, so a 13-year-old Liu Bian was enthroned and became historically known as Emperor Shao. Empress He, as the emperor's mother, became empress dowager and attended imperial court sessions alongside her son. As Emperor Shao was still young, General-in-Chief He Jin and Grand Tutor Yuan Wei (袁隗) served as his regents.|$|E
25|$|The band's {{first tour}} was in {{supporting}} The Red Chord across the United Kingdom. As with other early tours, {{they were able}} to get this slot by tricking venue promoters. Kean and Oliver's mother Carol Sykes were the de facto managers of the band at this time, a role they continued to occupy right up until 2008. For The Red Chord support, Kean emailed promoters <b>and</b> <b>pretended</b> they were opening on all of the dates, when in reality they were supposed to only play at their local show. This led them to being booked for the whole tour. In another case, Sykes created an e-mail account in the name of Johnny Truant vocalist Oliver Mitchell, which he used to contact a promoter requesting Bring Me the Horizon on their tour. Their live performances in their early history were fueled by alcohol consumption where the band would get so drunk they would vomit on stage and would damage their own equipment.|$|E
25|$|In early April 1288 {{the naval}} fleet, led by Omar and escorted by infantry, fled home along the Bạch Đằng river. As bridges and roads were {{destroyed}} and attacks were launched by Đại Việt troops, the Mongols reached Bạch Đằng without an infantry escort. Đại Việt's small flotilla engaged in battle <b>and</b> <b>pretended</b> to retreat. The Mongols eagerly pursued the Đại Việt troops only {{to fall into}} their pre-arranged battlefield. Thousands of small Đại Việt boats quickly appeared from both banks, launched a fierce attack that broke the Mongols' combat formation. The Mongols, meeting such a sudden and strong attack, in panic tried to withdraw to the sea. The Mongols' boats were halted, and many were damaged and sank. At that time, a number of fire rafts quickly rushed toward the Mongols, who were frightened and jumped down to reach the banks where they were dealt a heavy blow by an army led by the Trần king and Trần Hưng Đạo.|$|E
