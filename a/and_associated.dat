Gillum <b>and</b> <b>Associates</b> failed to review the initial design thoroughly, and accepted Havens' proposed plan without performing basic calculations that would have revealed its serious intrinsic flaws — in particular, the doubling of the load on the fourth-floor beams. It was later revealed that when Havens called Jack D. Gillum <b>and</b> <b>Associates</b> to propose the new design, the engineer they spoke with simply approved the changes over the phone, without viewing any sketches or performing calculations.|$|R
