Normally the effective population size, which is smaller than the total population, is used to determine these probabilities. The effective population (N'e) takes into account factors such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> inbreeding, the stage of the lifecycle in which the population is the smallest, and the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection. The effective population size may not be the same for every gene in the same population.|$|E
5|$|The {{time for}} a neutral allele to become fixed by genetic drift depends on {{population}} size, with fixation occurring more rapidly in smaller populations. The number of individuals in a population is not critical, but instead a measure known as the effective population size. The effective population is usually smaller than the total population since it takes into account factors such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> inbreeding and {{the stage of the}} lifecycle in which the population is the smallest. The effective population size may not be the same for every gene in the same population.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes are {{involved}} in defending the territory. One aspect of territorial defense involves identifying {{the proximity of the}} threat based on the loudness of bird song as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> degradation of the calls. In experiments involving playback, the wrens are capable of discriminating between degraded and undegraded songs, as well as degraded songs in the same acoustic conditions, and can detect changes of acoustic properties within their territories, such as songs under foliage. Song degradation {{can also be used to}} determine the proximity of potential intruders. If the song of a bird appears to be degraded, the wrens will assume that the threat is distant not respond; if the song is not degraded, they respond by attacking. Not all birds within their territory are potential enemies. Some species of birds that are neighbors are designated as 'dear-enemies' by the wrens, and the responses to neighbors and intruders in their territories differ by the season. In spring, the wrens respond more aggressively toward neighbors, though in the fall, no major discrepancy in responses is shown. When protecting their nest, alarm calls are the general response. The wrens judge the size of the potential threat, such as a blue jay and avoid the risk of injury when attacking. Countersinging produced by intruder birds is more likely to be taken as an aggressive threat to male Carolina wrens.|$|E
40|$|Victimization {{can have}} serious {{negative}} impact on adolescents’ well-being with consequences that last into young adulthood. In this study, we examined the protective function of friendship quality for victimized adolescents. Participants were 293 Finnish adolescents (124 boys and 169 girls; Mage 13. 42). We measured three friendship quality indices (positive friendship quality, conflict and co-rumination) and three maladjustment outcome variables (anger, sadness and anxiety). We expected that adolescents high in positive friendship quality or low in conflict to be less maladjusted. At co-rumination we looked more exploratory. We were able to partially confirm our hypotheses. Our results showed that whereas the link between victimization and anger became weaker <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> positive friendship quality and co-rumination decreased, victimization-sadness associations became weaker <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> positive friendship quality increased. Unexpectedly, victimization-sadness associations also became weaker <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> conflict and co-rumination increased.

5|$|For {{the final}} {{destruction}} of the Genesis planet, footage from the Paramount set had to be carefully matched with ILM effects footage. ILM built scale miniatures cut into sections to portray parts of Genesis' upheaval (rock slides, fissures opening in the ground) that live-action scenes could not easily replicate. One of the largest miniatures, measuring , had trick trees and trapdoors that could be reset, propane jets for gusts of fire, and solenoid-triggered rockfalls. For scenes where Kirk and Kruge battle at a precipice over a pit of lava, the shot combined animated lava, clouds (really cotton daubs on black), lightning, and a matte painting. Overhead shots of the lava were created by lighting a piece of clear Plexiglass with colored gels and covering the plate with methacyl, vermiculite and charcoal; the mixture dripped off the surface and coated the crew underneath. ILM simulated Kruge's demise, a long plunge into the pool of lava, {{with the help of}} a stop-motion puppet. Lloyd fell a few feet onto a black mattress; during a lighting flash the actor was replaced by the puppet that fell the rest of the distance. Because the shot was filmed on black instead of the traditional bluescreen, the animators had to remove or rotoscope the black background around Lloyd one frame at a time. The transition between the footage of Lloyd and the puppet was hidden by a single-frame flash as a bolt of lightning struck Kruge. The scene of Kirk and Spock beaming away as the ground collapses was another created at ILM, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> destruction was simply not possible for the live action crew.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-sixteenth {{century the}} Reformation revolutionised church {{architecture}} in Scotland. It {{resulted in a}} rejection of the elaborate ornamentation of existing churches. New churches were produced in a plain style, often with a T-plan that emphasised the pulpit and preaching. This style was adopted by both Presbyterian and Episcopalian wings of the Scottish Kirk, but there were some attempts to introduce Baroque elements into church building after the Restoration. In the eighteenth century the influence of James Gibbs led to churches that employed classical elements, with a pedimented rectangular plan and often with a steeple. This classicism continued into the early nineteenth century, but became increasingly controversial and began to be rejected for a version of the Gothic revival, which flourished into the early twentieth century. Between the world wars, a form of neo-Romanesque became the norm for new churches. In {{the second half of the}} twentieth century new churches were highly influenced by modernism, resulting in rectangular and irregularly shaped buildings, built in new materials, although many of these were later demolished. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> new building reduced from the 1970s there was a move to functional and unambitious new churches, but in the 1980s there was a move back to more striking and original designs.|$|E
