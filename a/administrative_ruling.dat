5000|$|Lobbying brings {{valuable}} information to policymakers, according to another {{argument in favor}} of lobbying. Since lobbyists often become highly knowledgeable about a specific issue by studying it in depth over years, they can bring considerable expertise to help legislators avoid errors as well as grasp the nuances of complex issues. This information can also help Congress oversee numerous federal agencies which often regulate complex industries and issue highly detailed and specific rulings. Accordingly, it is difficult for Congress to keep track of what these agencies do. It has been argued that lobbyists can help Congress monitor this activity by possibly raising [...] "red flags" [...] about proposed administrative rulings. Further, congresspersons can quickly gauge where they stand about a proposed <b>administrative</b> <b>ruling</b> simply by seeing which lobbying groups support the proposal, and which oppose it.|$|E

5000|$|The {{position}} [...] "Surintendant des finances" [...] {{was officially}} created in 1561 {{during the reign}} of Charles IX, although some royal financial advisors had performed analogous duties previously. The position grew out of the positions of Intendants of Finances, officially created in 1552 by Henry II to oversee royal finances during the king's travels in Germany (he sought an alliance with Protestant Princes). At the time, three Intendants of Finances were named, and one of them would also participate in the Privy Counsel, thus the designation [...] "superintendent". In 1561, the position fell to two individuals: Artus de Cossé-Brissac and the comte de Chaulnes. An <b>administrative</b> <b>ruling</b> on 23 October 1563 mandated once-a-week reunions of the Conseil du Roi (King's Counsel) to deal with financial questions of finances; to this meeting would come the superintendent of finances and other officers of country's financial administration, such as the Treasurer (trésorier de l'Épargne). In 1567, Cossé was promoted to maréchal de France; he resigned his post in favor of René de Birague (as did too, apparently, the comte de Chaulnes); René de Birague was thus the sole [...] "superintendent".|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} private {{enforcement}} assumes {{some kind of}} deviation from the general discipline, in order to incentivize judicial initiatives of private parties. European law does not contemplate any consistent proxy of a specific regime shaped after the goal of promoting private initiatives against breach of competition law. This being the framework, {{it is to be}} recognized that, from a legal point of view, the European debate about private enforcement of antitrust law boils down to the produce of an optical distortion, consisting of looking at a (peculiar) case of tort liability through the lens of another discipline. As usually occurs whenever an infringement of a public law, in and of itself susceptible of triggering some sort of administrative or criminal sanction, determines also some loss for an individual, the two trajectories remain conceptually autonomous: a feature that is preserved even where the pre-existence of an <b>administrative</b> <b>ruling</b> influences heavily the practical viability of a private action. Yet, it is obvious that remedies in the context of private litigation also serve the public interest in maintaining effective competition in the market. This circumstance does not mean that tort law, when referred to prejudice provoked by an anticompetitive behaviour, becomes a province of antitrust enforcement. The alternative, then, is not whether there ought to be private redress in addition to public enforcement; the basic question is whether private antitrust damages actions should be encouraged via a more favourable legal framework than the current one...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between environmental public law and environmental private law is {{of a growing}} significance. Not only environmental criminal law {{has an effect on}} environmental private law, but, {{since the beginning of the}} new legal, economic and political era in 1989, private law elements are also to be found in the environmental administrative law. The reciprocity between environmental private and administrative law is clear-cut. Private law institutions, like injunction or deposit, are upheld in environmental administrative contracts. The effect of an <b>administrative</b> <b>ruling</b> has legal consequences in the {{relationship between}}, e. g., neighbors: there are cases in which a noisy neighbor can be brought before the public administration. The objective liability in the field of environmental private law is accepted by the courts and by the citizens. The level of objectivity may, though, vary from country to country. In the practice of the Hungarian environmental private law, after 3 years, the objective liability is subrogated by a subjective liability, this latter one making exculpation easier. The res ipsa loquitur liability in space law is not an absolute liability, though it establishes a praesumptio juris that the environmental damage caused by a space object (e. g. a satellite) is to be covered by the state which has sent the satellite into space. The presumption is, though not easily, rebuttable. In the Hungarian case law, objective environmental liability has been applied sub judice since the novella of the Civil Code in 1977. This novella made environmental private law a part of environmental law. The novella of the Civil Code was preceded by the Act on Environmental Protection of 1976. The importance of economics in environmental private law has only recently been accepted by the Hungarian legal science. The role of the Coase theory is indisputable. The environmental private law is quite a new phenomenon in the Hungarian legal science, however, the institution of neighborhood damage has been present in the Hungarian case law since the 19 th century. The case law added two systems of sanctioning to the disposition of the neighborhood norm in the Hungarian Civil Code: the indemnity and the protection of possession...|$|E
