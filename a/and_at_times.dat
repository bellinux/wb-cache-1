5|$|The Gaelic Ragnall {{corresponds}} to the Old Norse Rǫgnvaldr. Both names were Latinised to Reginaldus. The fact that two closely related Hebridean rulers, Ragnall and Rǫgnvaldr, shared the same personal names, the same grandfather, <b>and</b> (<b>at</b> <b>times)</b> the same title, has perplexed modern historians and possibly mediaeval chroniclers as well.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews, with critics praising it {{as a fine}} example in the adventure gaming genre.

5|$|After the Third Battle of Ypres petered out in late 1917, the Western Front {{fell into}} its usual lull {{over the winter}} months. In early 1918, it became {{apparent}} to the Allies that a large German offensive was pending. This Spring Offensive commenced on 21 March 1918, with over one million men in three German armies striking hard near the junction between the French and British armies. The main effort of this offensive hit the British Fifth Army, which formed the right flank of the British front line. Struck a staggering blow, it began a rapid <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>times</b> panicked withdrawal. The key railway junction at Amiens was soon threatened.|$|E

5|$|Anquetil Duperron, a French Orientalist {{received}} a manuscript of the Oupanekhat and translated the Persian version into French and Latin, publishing the Latin translation {{in two volumes}} in 1801–1802 as Oupneck'hat. The French translation was never published. The Latin version was the initial introduction of Upanishadic thought to Western scholars. However, according to Deussen, the Persian translators took great liberties in translating the text <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>times</b> changed the meaning.|$|E
5|$|Chopin {{published}} his music in France, England and the German states {{due to the}} copyright laws of the time. As such there are often three different kinds of ‘first editions’. Each edition {{is different from the}} other, as Chopin edited them separately <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>times</b> he did some revision to the music while editing it. Furthermore, Chopin provided his publishers with varying sources, including autographs, annotated proofsheets and scribal copies. Only recently have these differences gained greater recognition.|$|E
5|$|During the 1941 {{collapse}} of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia under the Axis invasion in the April War, the Independent State of Croatia was created. It was ruled by the extreme nationalist Ustaša regime. The Ustaša quickly started with the systematic persecution of the Jews, modeled after the Nazi Germany approach, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>times</b> even more brutal. Racial laws were introduced, Jewish property was confiscated, and the Jews were subjected to mass arrests and deportations to death camps in Croatia and abroad.|$|E

5|$|During the Northern Song (960–1126 CE), a {{new class}} of scholar-artists emerged who did not possess the tromp l'oiel skills of the academy {{painters}} nor even the proficiency of common marketplace painters. The literati's painting was simpler <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>times</b> quite unschooled, yet they would criticize these other two groups as mere professionals, since they relied on paid commissions for their livelihood and did not paint merely for enjoyment or self-expression. The scholar-artists considered that painters who concentrated on realistic depictions, who employed a colorful palette, or, worst of all, who accepted monetary payment for their work were no better than butchers or tinkers in the marketplace. They were not to be considered real artists.|$|E

5|$|During the war, the Army also trained {{animals for}} use in the trenches. Dogs carried messages; horses, mules and dogs were used to lay {{telephone}} and telegraph cables. Carrier pigeons, who transported messages back from the front line, were also carried in tanks so that they could deliver messages during an attack. Over 20,000 pigeons and 370 handlers were used during the war, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>times,</b> they were the sole means of communication.|$|E

5|$|In Buah Rindu, {{particularly}} {{its earlier}} poems, Amir shows {{an affinity for}} using traditional Malay poetic forms such as the quatrain (found in pantun and syair). However, unlike the highly fixed traditional forms, Amir mixes the rhyming patterns; for instance, one quatrain may have a monorhyme (seloka) while the next may have an alternating simple 4-line (pantun) pattern. Lines are generally divided by a clear caesura, {{and in some cases}} even two. The caesura may not always be in the centre of a line; it is at times towards the front, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>times</b> towards the rear.|$|E

In the discussion of grammar to follow, the variety of Mongolian treated is Standard Khalkha Mongolian (i.e., the standard written language as formalized in the writing conventions and in the school grammar), but {{much of what is}} to be said is also valid for vernacular (spoken) Khalkha and for other Mongolian dialects, especially Chakhar.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} after the {{announcement}} that applications were being sought for the second group of NASA astronauts, Armstrong {{became more and more}} excited about the prospects of both the Apollo program and of investigating a new aeronautical environment. Armstrong's astronaut application arrived about a week past the June 1, 1962, deadline. Dick Day, with whom Armstrong had worked closely at Edwards, saw the late arrival of the application and slipped it into the pile before anyone noticed. At Brooks Air Force Base at the end of June, Armstrong underwent a medical exam that many of the applicants described as painful <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>times</b> seemingly pointless.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} whether bicultural competence {{served as a}} mediator (i. e., an apparent causal mechanism) or a moderator (i. e., a variable that describes for whom or under what situation) {{for the relationship between}} Acculturative Family Distancing (AFD) and two psychological outcomes (i. e., depression and psychological wellbeing). A total of 258 Latino college students attending large, predominantly White public universities in the Midwest completed two online surveys in the fall 2012 and spring 2013 semesters. Data were analyzed using path analysis to test for mediation and hierarchical regression analyses to test for moderation. For mediation, results indicated that bicultural competence <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 mediated the relations between AFD <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1 <b>and</b> depression <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 <b>and</b> psychological wellbeing <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 above <b>and</b> beyond the effects of depression, psychological wellbeing, acculturation, <b>and</b> enculturation <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1. Moreover, about 26 % of the variance in bicultural competence <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 was explained by AFD, enculturation, acculturation, <b>and</b> psychological wellbeing <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1; 23 % of the variance in depression <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 was explained by bicultural competence <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2, depression <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1, <b>and</b> psychological wellbeing <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1; <b>and</b> 32 % of variance in psychological wellbeing <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 was explained by bicultural competence <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 <b>and</b> psychological wellbeing <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1. For moderation, results demonstrated a main effect of AFD on psychological wellbeing <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 <b>and</b> a main effect of bicultural competence on both depression <b>and</b> psychological wellbeing <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2. The interaction of AFD and bicultural competence did not significantly predict depression <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 or psychological wellbeing <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 2 after the effects of depression, psychological wellbeing, acculturation, <b>and</b> enculturation <b>at</b> <b>Time</b> 1 were statistically controlled. Limitations, future research directions, and implications for counseling were discussed...|$|R

5|$|Love, Loss, and What I Wore is a play {{written by}} Nora and Delia Ephron {{based on the}} 1995 book {{of the same name}} by Ilene Beckerman.

5|$|Modern {{critical}} opinion {{has been}} kinder {{than that of}} Bizet's day. Commentators describe {{the quality of the}} music as uneven <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>times</b> unoriginal, but acknowledge the opera as a work of promise in which Bizet's gifts for melody and evocative instrumentation are clearly evident. They have identified clear foreshadowings of the composer's genius which would culminate, 10 years later, in Carmen. Since 1950 the work has been recorded on numerous occasions, in both the revised and original versions.|$|E
