Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSARs) are developed relating the disappearance rate constants of halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons in anoxic sediments to readily available molecular descriptors. The correlations are based on disappearance rate constants for the reductive transformation of approximately 45 halogenated hydrocarbons. A batch method was used in which the compounds were incubated in a standard water-sediment system and periodically analysed. Subsequently the pseudo-first order reaction rates were correlated to several molecular descriptors. The best correlations were obtained using the following descriptors: 1.

30|$|During <b>acclimation</b> <b>periods</b> of Reactor I and II, the Shannon index {{increased}} gradually, {{which indicated}} the colonization and {{reproduction of the}} bacteria. Then, when real RAS wastewater was used, the Shannon index decreased in both reactors and the bio-diversities were decreased, which {{could be explained by}} the higher abundance of dominating species. It was interesting to notice that all the samples in the reactor bottom have lower Shannon index than that of middle, which indicated the microbial diversity got higher along the reactor column to the middle. We assume that in the anoxic up-flow fixed bed reactors (I and II), the relative higher nitrate and DO concentration in the bottom decreased the bacterial diversity, on the other hand, in interval aeration Reactor (III) the relative low DO concentration in the bottom decreased the bacterial diversity. However, the higher carrying capacity introduced by higher DOC concentration in Reactor II as well as lower microbial diversity put it into a situation where is more susceptible to pathogens invaders or opportunistic bacteria proliferation, which may cause disease to aquatic animals (Attramadal et al. 2012). Overall, salinity, as a selective pressure, significantly decreased the microbial diversity and evenness while DO had little effect and higher bio-diversity was discovered in the middle layer of the reactors.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Sound {{production}} and hearing sensitivity of ectothermic animals {{are affected by}} the ambient temperature. This is the first study investigating the influence of temperature on both sound {{production and}} on hearing abilities in a fish species, namely the neotropical Striped Raphael catfish Platydoras armatulus. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Doradid catfishes produce stridulation sounds by rubbing the pectoral spines in the shoulder girdle and drumming sounds by an elastic spring mechanism which vibrates the swimbladder. Eight fish were acclimated for at least three weeks to 22 °, then to 30 ° and again to 22 °C. Sounds were recorded in distress situations when fish were hand-held. The stridulation sounds became shorter at the higher temperature, whereas pulse number, maximum pulse period and sound pressure level did not change with temperature. The dominant frequency increased when the temperature was raised to 30 °C and the minimum pulse period became longer when the temperature decreased again. The fundamental frequency of drumming sounds increased at the higher temperature. Using the auditory evoked potential (AEP) recording technique, the hearing thresholds were tested at six different frequencies from 0. 1 to 4 kHz. The temporal resolution was determined by analyzing the minimum resolvable click period (0. 3 - 5 ms). The hearing sensitivity was higher at the higher temperature and differences were more pronounced at higher frequencies. In general, latencies of AEPs in response to single clicks became shorter at the higher temperature, whereas temporal resolution in response to double-clicks did not change. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data indicate that sound characteristics as well as hearing abilities are affected by temperatures in fishes. Constraints imposed on hearing sensitivity at different temperatures cannot be compensated even by longer <b>acclimation</b> <b>periods.</b> These changes in sound production and detection suggest that acoustic orientation and communication are affected by temperature changes in the neotropical catfish P. armatulus...|$|R

With long <b>acclimation</b> <b>periods,</b> OLR as high as 3. 4 g 				COD/L-d and SLR of 0. 3 g/L-d can be tolerated, producing 				effluent volatile-acid COD levels consistently less than 200 				mg/L. Effluent dissolved sulfide and hydrogen sulfide levels 				were around 600 mg S/L and 150 mg S/L, respectively, during this 				period. In addition to long term operation, the effect of 				organic shock loading was assessed. The reactors were able to 				recover from one but not two lactate spikes of approximately 				 5, 000 mg COD/L.

The objectives of the research are to isolate cold acclimation genes from S. commersonii, to examine the temporal-specific expression of selected genes, and to study the composition of these genes. A cDNA library was constructed from polyA-RNA of S. commersonii leaves after 14 days of acclimation at 4 ℃. Two hundred and forty-one plagues that hybridized with 32 P-labeled single-strand cDNA of 14 days of acclimated leaves but not for controls, were preliminary selected. Followed in vitro excision of selected phages and repeating DNA dot blot hybridization, four genes (ca 101, ca 106, ca 127, ca 153) were selected. The results of northern blot hybridization showed that ca 106 and ca 153 genes were induced, ca 101 and ca 127 genes were increased in expression by cold acclimation. There are two patterns of expression in these four genes in regard to the amount of expression during 14 days of cold <b>acclimation</b> <b>periods.</b> Rapid increases in expression of ca 101 and ca 106 were found in S. commersonii leaves after one day of acclimation, followed by little decline, and then increases on day 10.

The objectives of this study were to determine if LT tolerance genes are developmentally regulated. Low-temperature response curves were determined for spring wheat and barley genotypes grown at 4 °C under 8 hour (h) short day (SD) and 20 h long day (LD) photoperiods for various <b>acclimation</b> <b>periods</b> up to 112 days. Final leaf number (FLN) and growth of shoot apex was used to determine the stage of phenological development. Expression of LT tolerance genes was determined by LT 50. A delay in transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase in SD sensitive, non-hardy AC Minto spring wheat and highly SD sensitive Dicktoo barley grown under SD resulted in an increased level and/or longer retention of expression of LT tolerance genes. In vernalization requiring winter genotypes photoperiod response of SD sensitive winter barley and wheat genotypes was reflected in the level of expression of LT tolerance genes beginning {{in the early stages of}} vernalization and plant development. A delay in transition to the vegetative stage allowed LT acclimation to continue to colder temperatures under SD compared to LD conditions in photoperiod sensitive genotypes. To determine the interrelationships between the developmental stages and LT gene expression, winter wheat genotypes were LT acclimated at 4 °C under SD and LD from 0 to 112 d. Also, three de-acclimation (20 C) and re-acclimation cycles were used beginning before and after vegetative/reproductive transition. Development of the SD de-acclimated plants was greatly delayed compared to LD plants as determined by shoot apex development, and this delay was reflected in the ability of SD plants to re-acclimate to much lower temperatures. Results indicated that expression of LT tolerance genes is governed by developmental regimes and plants in the vegetative phase have a much greater ability to LT acclimate than plants in the reproductive phase. These results support the hypothesis that level and duration of expression of LT tolerance genes determine the degree of LT tolerance and that LT tolerance genes are developmentally regulated...|$|R

40|$|Evaluation of salivary {{proteins}} {{as potential}} biomarkers of milk production in hot climates Ana CAPM Geraldo 1, Cristina Conceição 1, 2, Liliana Cachucho 2, Flávio Silva 2, Catarina Matos 2, Elsa Lamy 1, Fernando Capela e Silva 1, 3, and Alfredo Pereira 1, 2 1 Institute of Mediterranean Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, University of Evora, Portugal; 2 Department of Zootechnics, University of Évora, Portugal; 3 Department of Biology, University of Evora, Portugal ecsl@uevora. pt Dairy cattle are particularly sensitive to high temperatures, lowering milk output {{as well as}} milk quality (fat, solid, lactose and protein). Given the trend of global warming, the joint selection for productivity and adaptability is an objective, i. e. greater heat loss without lowering the metabolism. So, to search and validate the xistence of non"invasive biomarkers that could allow selection of the animals best adapted is crucial to achieve such an objective. The interest of saliva {{as a source of}} biomarkers starts to increase in animal production. Salivary ortisol has been used in some studies, but it presents some limitations for thermal stress, which can be circumvent by salivary proteins. The hypothesis that cows presenting high potential for milk production under adverse thermal conditions also present differences in salivary protein profiles comparatively to the ones less productive, is actually being tested at ICAAM"University of Évora, Portugal, by our research team. The experiment was design to identify salivary proteins whose expression levels can be related to the potential for milk production under unfavourable thermal conditions. Twelve animals (6 high and 6 low milk potential production) were analysed for salivary protein composition at three different acclimation time points: first, during summer, under hot temperatures; second, under thermoneutrality; and third, during winter, under low temperatures. Whole saliva was collected directly from cow mouth, using cotton rolls (salivettes). At each time point, collection was performed in two different days, to avoid bias due to particular variations due to environment. One and two"dimensional electrophoresis are being performed to compare salivary proteomes from animals with different milk production potential, and to assess how differences between these groups are maintained through the different <b>acclimation</b> <b>periods.</b> COST FA 1308 - Dairy Care; ICAA...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} feeding and fasting were {{examined}} on the deep-living short-spine thornyhead (Sebastolobus alascanus) and the confamilial shallow-living spotted scorpionfish (Scorpaena guttata) {{to determine whether}} the low metabolic rate of the deeper-living species was in part a consequence of food deprivation in its habitat. Laboratory <b>acclimation</b> for <b>periods</b> of 90 – 115 days under either ad libitum feeding or complete fasting did not lead to similar rates of respiration in individuals of the two species held under identical conditions. Respiration of fish fed ad libitum was 52 % (S. guttata) or 68 % (S. alascanus) higher than for fasted fish of the same species. Furthermore, the metabolic rates of freshly collected specimens of S. alascanus resembled those of laboratory-fasted fish. In white skeletal muscle, both total protein concentration and the activities of four enzymes of ATP metabolism, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and pyruvate kinase (PK) of glycolysis, malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and citrate synthase (CS, a citric acid cycle indicator), were lower in S. alascanus than in S. guttata. Within a species, protein concentration and activities of the four enzymes in white muscle, but not in brain, were higher in fed than in starved fish...|$|R
40|$|Wild rabbit {{is a very}} {{important}} species in the Mediterranean region. Its relevance is both ecological, being a keystone species —prey for several predators— and economic, as it is the most important and the most managed small game species among mammals in the Iberian Peninsula. Although both researchers and game managers claim restocking operations have moderate to low success, it {{is still one of the}} management measures often used by conservationists and hunters to recover or boost wild rabbit populations. The high mortality usually verified in the first days after release is the main limiting factor in rabbit restocking. Based on practical research, protocols have improved, pointing out good practices and suggestions to increase success. Adopting soft instead of hard-release protocols has been proven to increase short-term survival after liberation. Aware that purchased rabbits seldom display a quick adaptation to the field, we performed two restocking experiments with different conditions (<b>acclimation</b> <b>period</b> and park size) in order to compare the outcomes in terms of survival rate. The rabbit batch that experienced a longer <b>acclimation</b> <b>period</b> in a larger park showed higher survival rates, as well as more frequent and much larger spatial movements. These results suggest that proper conditions during acclimation may contribute to the success of wild rabbit restocking operations...|$|E
40|$|During cold {{acclimation}} of Puma rye (Secale cereale L. cv Puma), the intracellular {{osmotic potential}} nearly doubles. During this period, {{the accumulation of}} glycinebetaine, proline, and soluble sugars was monitored. The amount of glycinebetaine increased from 290 to 1300 micrograms per gram fresh weight during the 4 -week <b>acclimation</b> <b>period.</b> Proline content did not change during the first 3 weeks of acclimation but then increased from 27 to 580 micrograms per gram fresh weight during the next 3 weeks. The total soluble sugar content more than doubled by {{the second week of}} cold acclimation, increasing from 11 to 26 milligrams per gram fresh weight. Most of this increase {{can be attributed to the}} accumulation of sucrose and raffinose, whose levels increased from 2. 4 and 0 to 11 and 5 milligrams per gram fresh weight, respectively. The content of monosaccharides, predominantly glucose, remained at a constant 10 milligrams per gram fresh weight throughout the <b>acclimation</b> <b>period.</b> A comparison of the sugar content of protoplasts versus vacuoles isolated from cold-acclimated leaves revealed that the extravacuolar volume contained monosaccharides, sucrose, and raffinose. Thus, the increased amounts of sucrose and raffinose that occur during cold acclimation are present in compartments external to the vacuole and may contribute to cryoprotection...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{tests were}} {{conducted}} using juvenile chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis, and rainbow trout O. mykiss to determine specific behavior responses to infrasound (3 ̆c 20 Hz) and flashing strobe lights. The objective of these tests {{was to determine if}} juvenile salmonids could be deterred from entrainment at water diversion structures. Caged fish were acclimated in a static test tank and their behavior was recorded using low light cameras. Species-specific behavior was characterized by measuring movements of the fish within the cage and by observing startle and habituation responses. Wild chinook salmon (40 - 45 mm TL) and hatchery reared chinook salmon (45 - 50 mm TL) exhibited avoidance responses when initially exposed to a 10 -Hz volume displacement source of infrasound. Rainbow and eastern brook trout (25 - 100 mm TL) did not respond with avoidance or other behaviors to infrasound. Evidence of habituation to the infrasound source was evident for chinook salmon during repeated exposures. Wild and hatchery chinook displayed a higher proportion of movement during the initial exposures to infrasound when the <b>acclimation</b> <b>period</b> in the test tank was 2 - 3 h as compared with a 12 - 15 h <b>acclimation</b> <b>period.</b> A flashing strobe light produced consistent movement in wild chinook salmon (60...|$|E
40|$|Avian {{species are}} known to have the {{capacity}} to respond to environmental changes through physiological adjustments. The process whereby organisms adjust their phenotype without genetic change is termed phenotypic plasticity and it is mostly observed to be a phenotypic improvement to ecological challenges. Metabolic rate (MR), which is the rate of energy expenditure in a species, is a highly flexible physiological parameter which results in a great diversity of avian standardised metabolic rates. Like birds from high latitudes, Afrotropical bird species are expected to have the capacity to adjust their energy expenditure to match the availability of resources. Previous studies on the flexibility of physiological parameters in birds have focused on the magnitude of change of physiological adjustments and the cues inducing these changes. Comparative research has furthermore investigated metabolic rates across aridity, altitude, latitude and temperature gradients. Recently, a clear dichotomy has become evident with elevated metabolic rates observed in high latitude birds in winter and a down-regulation of metabolic rates observed in birds exposed to low latitude mild winters. In this study, the shape of the reaction norm, the magnitude, the reversibility, the direction and the rate of change of two physiological parameters, basal metabolic rate (BMR) and summit metabolic rate (Msum), were investigated in a coastal and an inland population of Southern Red Bishops (Euplectes orix) through seasonal acclimatisation and laboratory acclimation. Summer and winter basal metabolic rates as well as body mass, were highly flexible traits in free-ranging coastal and inland Red Bishops. Birds acclimatised to a mild coastal climate in winter exhibited reduced basal and summit metabolic rates, whereas birds originating from a more variable inland climate increased basal metabolic rate in winter, but did not show increases of Msum in winter. Red Bishops responded to short term thermal acclimation under laboratory conditions by gradually changing body mass. <b>Acclimation</b> <b>periods</b> of 21 days revealed a negative relationship between body mass and acclimation air temperature. Peak responses of basal metabolic rate to ambient temperature change were observed in both coastal and inland birds between two and eight days after the change in acclimation air temperature. The influences of seasonal acclimatisation on energy expenditure differed between coastal and inland birds, however, during laboratory acclimation individuals from the two populations showed no difference in response. Within the individuals of the coastal and inland Southern Red Bishops, phenotypic flexibility is observed in body mass, basal metabolic rate and summit metabolic rate as a response to environmental changes. This flexibility is thought to increase thermoregulatory capacities of the Southern Red Bishop in different habitats and climates...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) and {{bluegill}} (Lepomis macrochirus) {{were exposed}} to flows of water containing low DO concentrations produced by bubbling nitrogen through the water. Abrupt exposure of fish to critical DO concentrations (The standard dose response) and by a more gradual changing of DO levels (The "stepdown" approach) were employed to investigate fish reactions. The stepdown test was explored as an alternative or supplement to the standard dose response. Rainbow trout held at 15 °C and bluegill at 22 °C during <b>acclimation</b> and test <b>periods</b> exhibited lower LC- 50 s and longer median resistance times than unacclimated fish. Tests were conducted in which some fish had access to an air/water interface, some had access to a nitrogen/water interface, and some were blocked away from the surface by screens. Both species were shown to benefit from access to an air/water interface. Hematocrit values for rainbow trout showed that acclimated and unacclimated test fish produced larger numbers of red blood cells when DO concentrations were reduced.

40|$|The light-enhanced {{production}} and accumulation of sugars {{is only one}} {{step in the process}} of cold acclimation in Hedera helix L. var. Thorndale (English ivy). Applications of 2, 4 -dinitrophenol to plants with different portions exposed to light and dark indicated that the mere presence or accumulation of the light-generated promoters did not invoke an increase in hardiness. Kinetics of cold <b>acclimation</b> during alternating <b>periods</b> of light and dark also indicate that the light stimulation of cold acclimation is only a partial component of the total process. Incubation on 50 mm solutions of sucrose can replace the light requirement. A second phase which can proceed in the dark is thought to result in the production of proteins which, due to an altered composition or configuration, have a greater capacity to bind sugars. This is evidenced by the fact that protein from cold acclimated tissue exhibited a higher sugar-binding capacity than protein from nonacclimated tissue. Furthermore, the two phases can proceed independently of each other, but only upon complementation of the products of the two phases is an increase in cold hardiness manifested...|$|R
