50|$|A {{hydrometer}} or <b>areometer</b> is {{an instrument}} that measures the specific gravity (relative density) of liquids—the ratio of {{the density of the}} liquid to the density of water.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{instrument}} called <b>areometer</b> (from Ancient Greek ἀραιός -araiós [...] "lightness" [...] and μέτρον -métron [...] "measure, scale"), {{also known}} as hydrometer, used for measuring liquids density, is often confused with the term aerometer here defined.|$|E
50|$|In 1784 he was {{proposed}} by Josiah Wedgwood (the current Chairman) and appointed as secretary to the General Chamber of Manufacturers of Great Britain, {{and he was}} also connected with the Society for the Encouragement of Naval Architecture, established in 1791. He gave much attention to the construction of various machines for comb-cutting, file-making, cylinder printing and other uses—he also invented an <b>areometer.</b>|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to examine the}} {{abilities}} of mercury of anthropogenic origin to migrate into the soil profile. The above phenomenon has been evaluated by comparing mercury content in the surface soil layer (0 - 20 cm) to its content in bedrock (70 - 100 cm). The studies were carried out on the premises of a plant that applies mercury in the technological processes and has not solved any issues related to waste management. The studies were situated in the southern outskirts of Warsaw on the premises of a plant that has produced mercury thermometers, <b>areometers,</b> mercury transmitters and some types of laboratory glass for about 50 years. In the close vicinity of the plant there are no other significant sources of pollution. The present studies prove that 50 -year activity of a plant that used mercury in the production processes has contributed to soil pollution by this element. Mercury content in the surface soil layer (0 - 20 cm) ranged from 1. 30 to 940. 00, and in the 70 - 100 cm layer from 1. 88 to 412. 00 mg•kg- 1 in soil dry mass...|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of a rapid method to evaluate the soil water content (U) {{can be an important}} tool to determine the moment to irrigate. The soil <b>areometer</b> consists of an elongated hydrostatic balance with a weighing pan, a graduated neck, a float and a pynometric flask. In this work an <b>areometer</b> was adapted to rapidly measure soil water content without the need of drying the soil. The expression U = (M A - M AD) /(M M -M A) was used to calculate the soil water content. In this equation M M is the mass to level the <b>areometer</b> with the pycnometric flask filled with water, M A the mass to level the <b>areometer</b> with a mass M M of soil in the pycnometer, the volume being completed with water, and similarly M AD the mass added to the pan to level the <b>areometer</b> with a mass M M of dried soil in the pycnometric flask. The convenience of this method is that the values M M and M AD are known. Consequently, the decision on irrigation can be made after a measurement that takes, about, ten minutes. The procedure involves only stirring the soil with water for at least 2 minutes to remove the adhered air. The soil water content data obtained with the areometric method were similar to those obtained weighing the soil before and after drying to constant weight, in an oven at 105 º C...|$|E
40|$|Particle size {{distribution}} {{is one of}} the most influential factors of most soil physical and even some soil chemical characteristics. As modern measurement techniques are being introduced, the need for comparing new methods with older methodologies arises because comparability means data continuity. Here, three institutes conducted a comparison of particle size measurement among the laser, <b>areometer</b> and pipette techniques. The purpose of the comparison was to a) discover any differences among operators, laboratories, and techniques; b) identify if there were any differences and if they could be linked to soil type (e. g. high clay, loam, or sand content) or particle size range; and c) understand if the laser diffraction method gave results that were significantly larger than the other methods of any size fraction. There was no statistically proven difference between the two operators examined based on the pipette method’s result. The comparison of two of the institutes’ pipette methods showed statistically significant differences for three of the eight samples tested. However, these differences only seemed to appear in the 0. 01 mm to 0. 02 mm particle size range. A technical comparison among all three methods resulted in significant differences in all cases except for one sample that had very high sand content and very low clay content. Finally, the laser diffraction method was analyzed to see if it measured a larger amount of the clay fraction, however, it instead overestimated the silt and the fine sand (0. 01 mm to 0. 02 mm) fraction, not the clay fraction. Therefore, we conclude that different methodologies can provide significant difference in particle-size measurement. Based on the results, we recommend creating a widely accepted patent for sample preparation (disaggregation, the use of peroxide or other agents, using ultrasonic or other methods) and for measuring techniques (a set of refractive and sorption indexes, using ultrasonic during the measurement, pump speed etc.) ...|$|E
