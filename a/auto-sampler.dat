We have assessed whether ovulation rate is reduced in SGA girls. Ovulatory function was assessed by weekly filter paper progesterone measurements, obtained by finger-stick <b>auto-sampling</b> for 3 consecutive months in matched populations of asymptomatic, nonobese girls (mean age, 15. 5 yr; > or = 3 yr postmenarche) who were either born with an appropriate weight for gestational age (AGA; n = 24; mean birthweight, 3. 3 kg) or born small for gestational age (SGA; n = 25; mean birthweight, 2. 3 kg). The prevalence of anovulation was higher among SGA than AGA girls (40 % vs. 4 %; P = 0. 002). Moreover, in the relatively small fraction of ovulating SGA girls, the ovulation rate was lower than in AGA adolescents (average number of ovulations during the study, 1. 4 vs. 1. 9; P < 0. 01).

40|$|Bibliography: pages 119 - 126. Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (GFAAS) {{was used}} for the {{determination}} of cadmium and beryllium in coal and fly ash slurries. Sample preparation involved grinding the sample to a fine powder and slurrying it in a suitable solvent. Stable slurries were maintained by magnetic stirring during sampling. Pyrolytically coated graphite tubes were used for cadmium determinations, while beryllium was determined with platform atomisation. Ammonium dihydrogen orthophosphate and magnesium nitrate matrix modifiers were used for cadmium and beryllium determinations respectively. Calibration graphs constructed with aqueous standards containing the appropriate matrix modifier were rectilinear to at least 100 pg cadmium and 45 pg beryllium. Results were calculated with integrated peak area measurements. The detection limits were 2. 9 pg for cadmium and 0. 7 pg for beryllium. Beryllium determinations were performed with semi-automatic sample introduction. The novel semi-automatic sampling unit utilised magnetic stirring for· the maintenance of stable slurries and operated with the standard Perkin-Elmer AS- 40 autosampler.

40|$|Within our {{physical}} world lies a digital world populated with an ever {{increasing number of}} sizeable data collections. Exploring these large datasets for patterns or trends is a difficult and complex task, especially when users do not always {{know what they are}} looking for. Information visualisation can facilitate this task through an interactive visual representation, thus making the data easier to interpret. However, we can soon reach a limit on the amount of data that can be plotted before the visual display becomes overcrowded or cluttered, hence potentially important information becomes hidden. The main theme of this work is to investigate the use of dynamic random sampling for reducing display clutter. Although randomness has been successfully applied in many areas of computer science and sampling has been used in data processing, the use of random sampling as a dynamic clutter reduction technique is novel. In addition, random sampling is particularly suitable for exploratory tasks as it offers a way of reducing the amount of data without the user having to decide what data is important. Sampling-based scatterplot and parallel coordinate visualisations are developed to experiment with various options and tools. These include simple, dynamic sampling controls with density feedback; a method of checking the reality of the representative sample; the option of global and/or localised clutter reduction using a variety of novel lenses and an <b>auto-sampling</b> option of automatically maintaining a reasonable view of the data within the lens. Furthermore, this work showed that sampling can be added to existing tools and used effectively in conjunction with other clutter reduction techniques. Sampling is evaluated both analytically, using a taxonomy of clutter reduction developed for the purpose, and experimentally using large datasets. The analytic route was prompted by an exploratory analysis, which showed that evaluation of information visualisation based on user studies are problematic. This thesis has contributed to several areas of research: ‣the feasibility and flexibility of global or lens-based sampling as a clutter reduction technique are demonstrated through sampling-based scatterplot and parallel coordinate visualisations. ‣the novel method of calculating the density for overlapping lines in parallel coordinate plots is both accurate and efficient and enables constant density within a sampling lens to be maintained without user intervention. ‣the novel criteria-based taxonomy of clutter reduction for information visualisation provides designers with a method to critique existing visualisations and think about new ones.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} concern about the widespread occurrence of emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) in the aquatic environment which could pose potential risks to humans and ecosystems. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are significant sources and major routes of EOCs entering the environment. There is therefore a need to study the fate of EOCs in WWTPs to improve the risk assessment for these EOCs. In this thesis, the passive sampling technique of diffusive gradients in thin-films (DGT) for in situ measurement of selected EOCs in water {{was developed in the}} laboratory and validated under the real world condition-a WWTP. This sampler was then employed to study the occurrence and removal efficiencies of EOCs in Chinese WWTPs, as China represents a significant and growing market for many of these chemicals. A novel DGT technique was developed for in situ measurement of EOCs in water, with hydrophilic-lipophilic-balanced (HLB) resin as the binding agent and agarose gel as the diffusion layer. The performance of DGT sampler (indicated by ratio of DGT-measured concentrations (CDGT) to the directly-measured concentration (Cb), the ratio of CDGT/Cb ranged from 0. 9 to 1. 1 indicating the excellent performance of DGT) in different pH, ionic strength and dissolved organic matter contents was tested with 11 chemicals and found to be relatively independent of pH (3. 5 - 9. 5), ionic strength (0. 001 - 0. 1 M) and dissolved organic matter (0 - 20 mg L- 1). Time and diffusion layer thickness dependence experiments confirmed the principle of DGT for accumulated chemicals consistent with theoretical predictions. The performance comparison of three types of resins (HLB, XAD 18 and Strata-XL-A) was undertaken. Resin properties and the interactions of functional groups between the resin and chemicals controlling the uptake of EOCs for DGT sampler were evaluated by comparing the uptake capacities and the kinetics of the test chemicals among three resins. The study in the laboratory, which is similar to above section for three types of DGT devices with HLB, XAD 18 and Strata-XL-A resins as the binding gels, confirmed the potential application of DGT principle for in situ measurement of EOCs in water. This DGT sampler was then compared with active sampling approaches, <b>auto-sampling</b> and grab-sampling in a WWTP. This study showed that the DGT sampler can continuously uptake the majority of detected EOCs in wastewater for 7 - 18 days. The time-weighted average concentrations measured by DGT were found to be comparable with the results delivered from the auto-samplers, showing similar concentrations and patterns. The effect of diffusive boundary layer was estimated, and was found to be relatively limited and much less compared with other passive samplers, demonstrating the advantage of DGT sampler. The field validation confirmed applicability of DGT sampler for studying the fate of EOCs in the wastewater. Before application of the DGT sampler into a large scale of fate study in Chinese WWTP, a sensitive analytical method was developed for simultaneous determination of target EOCs in surface water and wastewater. This method was optimised from solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedures to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer (LC-MS) analysis, and was demonstrated to provide reliable data for the samples with complex matrix and low enough detection limits for EOCs in the water. This analytical method could perform similarly or even better to some related studies for detection of the EOCs in wastewater. DGT devices with HLB resin gels were then applied to 10 WWTPs in China for studying the occurrence and removal of EOCs. All target EOCs could be found in the raw influent and majority of them (18 of 20) could still be detected in the final effluent. Removal efficiency of the EOCs varied, showing the performance of different treatment technology/processes on the EOCs removal in wastewater. The primary and secondary treatment units contributed to the most removal of the EOCs. This demonstrated that DGT sampler can be an effective and simple tool to study in fate of EOCs in wastewater. This research programme has shown that DGT sampler is an effective tool for studying the fate of wide range of emerging organic chemicals in the aquatic environment and assessing their risk/ toxicity of EOCs to the human and ecosystem...|$|R

The ultrafiltration membrane on the accumulation wall was regenerated cellulose with a cut-off of 10 kDa (Microdyn Nadir Filtration, Wuppertal, Germany).|$|E
30|$|The GC–MS {{analysis}} of the extracts was carried on Shimadzu (QP 2010 series) gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer (Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an AOC- 20 i <b>auto-sampler</b> coupled to a DB- 5 MS capillary column (30  m ×  0.25  mm i.d., 0.25  μm). The injection temperature was 40  °C and {{the volume of the}} sample was 2  μl. An initial temperature of 40  °C was maintained for 4  min, followed by a gradient increase to 230  °C at the rate of 4  °C/min and the temperature was held at 230  °C for 15  min. Inlet pressure was kept at 97.1  kPa with helium as a carrier gas released at a flow rate of 1.1  ml/min in split mode (1 : 50). The MS was set with an interface temperature of 250  °C at EI mode of MS and the detector voltage of 0.9  kV. The mass range was 40 – 800  u with the scan speed of 1666 u/s at an interval of 0.50  s (2  Hz).|$|E
30|$|A chromatographic system UHPLC UltiMate 3000 from Dionex-Thermo Scientific (USA), {{composed}} of a pump with a quaternary valve system for column selection, a thermostated <b>auto-sampler,</b> and a thermostated column compartment, was used. The separation was carried out with the column Syncronis C 18 50 [*]×[*] 2.1  mm, 1.7  μm. The mobile phase consisted of 70 / 30 MeOH/ 25  mM ammonium acetate (pH[*]=[*] 7.4) (A) and 26.5  mM ammonium acetate in MeOH (pH[*]=[*] 7.9) (B). A flow rate of 0.2  mL/min was used, and the gradient profile was 0 – 2  min, 0 – 100 % B; 2 – 20  min, 100 % B. The column temperature was set at 25  °C. The detection was performed at 267  nm for sorafenib and diC 16 dT and 257  nm for DOTAU. The injected volume was 1  μL leading to quantitation limits of 0.6  ng for sorafenib and 15  ng for both nucleolipids and DOTAU and diC 16 dT.|$|E
