2500|$|For {{an ocean}} {{in the shape}} of a {{circular}} basin enclosed by a coastline, the cotidal lines point radially inward and must eventually meet at a common point, the <b>amphidromic</b> <b>point.</b> The <b>amphidromic</b> <b>point</b> is at once cotidal with high and low waters, which is satisfied by zero tidal motion. (The rare exception occurs when the tide encircles an island, as it does around New Zealand, Iceland and Madagascar.) Tidal motion generally lessens moving away from continental coasts, so that crossing the cotidal lines are contours of constant amplitude (half the distance between high and low water) which decrease to zero at the <b>amphidromic</b> <b>point.</b> For a semi-diurnal tide the <b>amphidromic</b> <b>point</b> can be thought of roughly like the center of a clock face, with the hour hand pointing in the direction of the high water cotidal line, which is directly opposite the low water cotidal line. High water rotates about the <b>amphidromic</b> <b>point</b> once every 12 hours in the direction of rising cotidal lines, and away from ebbing cotidal lines. This rotation is generally clockwise in the southern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere, and is caused by the Coriolis effect. The difference of cotidal phase from the phase of a reference tide is the epoch. The reference tide is the hypothetical constituent [...] "equilibrium tide" [...] on a landless Earth measured at 0° longitude, the Greenwich meridian.|$|E

25|$|The {{exception}} is at Cook Strait where the tidal currents periodically link high to low water.

This study aims to obtain a comprehensive insight into the changes in tidal regimes in the Bohai Sea of China in response to local mean sea level rise. To achieve this goal the hydrodynamic model ROMS, previously calibrated and validated for Bohai Sea, was applied, considering local sea level rise scenario of 0. 5 m, 1 m, 2 m and 3 m in the future, respectively. The model results show that under sea level rise conditions the amplitude of the main semidiurnal (M- 2) constituent decreases in most areas except two areas where are around two <b>amphidromic</b> <b>points,</b> and changes in amplitude are not proportional {{to the level of}} sea level rise. However, compared results implied {{that it is necessary to}} consider the spatial-distribution of sea level-rise when predicting the effects of sea level rise in the future.

50|$|The {{coastal water}} {{dynamics}} {{are determined by}} the asymmetric coasts and the Mediterranean seawater's inflow through the Straits of Otranto and further on along the eastern coast. The smooth Italian coast (with very few protrusions and no major islands) allows the Western Adriatic Current's smooth flow, which is composed of the surface's relatively freshwater mass and the bottom's cold and dense water mass. The coastal currents on the opposite shore are far more complex, due to the jagged shoreline, several large islands and the Dinaric Alps' proximity to the shore. The last produces significant temperature variations between the sea and the hinterland, which leads to the creation of local jets. The tidal movement is normally slight, usually remaining below 30 cm. The <b>amphidromic</b> <b>point</b> is at the mid-width east of Ancona.|$|E

2500|$|An {{equilibrium}} tidal bulge {{does not}} really exist on Earth because the continents do not allow this mathematical solution to take place. Oceanic tides actually rotate around the ocean basins as vast gyres around several <b>amphidromic</b> <b>points</b> where no tide exists. The Moon pulls on each individual undulation as Earth rotates—some undulations are ahead of the Moon, others are behind it, whereas still others are on either side. The [...] "bulges" [...] that actually do exist for the Moon to pull on (and which pull on the Moon) are the net result of integrating the actual undulations over all the world's oceans.

40|$|In a small, rectangular, {{mid-latitude}} bay {{too narrow}} and too deep for Poincaré modes to propagates semidiurnal tidal energy, the co-oscillating semidiurnal tide must be primarily a superposition of oppositely travelling Kelvin waves. We generalize Taylor's (1921) {{study of the}} reflection of Kelvin waves {{at the head of}} such a bay, now allowing the boundary at the head to absorb a variable portion of the power flux incident upon it. In a bay of uniform depth, the resulting displacement of <b>amphidromic</b> <b>points</b> away from the central axis of the bay becomes a unique measure of the total energy loss {{at the head of the}} bay. This displacement explains the marked difference between semidiurnal tides in the Adriatic Sea and in the Gulf of California; a Kelvin wave fit to these tides yields both the tidal energy incident at the mouth of each basin and the tidal energy dissipated within each basin...|$|R
40|$|The {{scientific}} term "amphidrome" {{is usually}} associated with tides in oceanography. The dozen tidal amphidromes observed in the ocean are critical points that determine the fundamental pattern of the global tidal system. Exploration of recently available satellite data with an unprecedented 1 - 2 decades duration suggests that an amphidrome is not a tide-only phenomenon in the ocean. Analysis of altimeter-derived sea level anomaly (SLA) data and radiometer-derived sea surface temperature (SST) data allows ten <b>amphidromic</b> <b>points</b> to be clearly identified in annual SLA and SST variations. These amphidromes {{are located in the}} tropical areas of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian oceans. Their existence implies that the annual cycle (in time) of the atmosphere-ocean system is translated into a rotary variation (in space) for many of the geophysical parameters. It can be concluded that annual amphidromes are common, the knowledge of which is of particular interest, given their annually "constant" nature, for the monitoring and understanding of oceanic, climatic, as well as biological variabilities at seasonal to decadal scales, which strongly affect many aspects of the natural and societal activities on the globe...|$|R

40|$|The M 2 tide in the Bohai, Yellow, and East China Seas (BYECS) is {{simulated}} by assimilating the TOPEX/Poseidon altimetry {{data with}} the adjoint method.

40|$|Two {{years of}} sea surface current {{measurements}} acquired since August 2012 by High-Frequency SeaSonde radars over the relatively shallow shelf area dividing the Maltese Islands from Sicily (the Malta - Sicily Channel), {{are used to}} characterize the surface tidal currents in the region. Tidal currents are generally weak and concentrated in the semidiurnal and diurnal bands, barely exceeding 3 cms - 1 in the semidiurnal band (M 2, S 2), and below 6 cms - 1 in the diurnal band (K 1, O 1). In the middle part of the basin, the M 2 currents oscillate along the main Channel axis; on the contrary the S 2 oscillations are oriented along the energetic Atlantic Ionian Stream (AIS) flow. Diurnal tides have a more circular pattern, also following the AIS path and with a significant intensification in proximity of the shelf break, thus suggesting a substantial contribution from internal tides in the region.

40|$|International audienceA {{homogeneous}} shallow-water {{model with}} free surface {{is used to}} model the tidal circulation in the Persian Gulf.

High precision bathymetric data are used to obtain the bottom topography. The numerical model is run {{for more than a}} year. The results are the following: 1) The model accurately reproduces the tidal phase and amplitude observed at 42 tidal gauges in the region. This accuracy is attributed to the presence of the 7 components which are able to interact nonlinearly; 2) The <b>amphidromic</b> <b>points</b> are also well positioned by the model due to a proper choice of bathymetry. This was checked also with a simpler geometry of the domain; 3) The tidal currents can be strong in the Straits of Hormuz and in shallow areas; thus they will have an effect of the hydrology of the region. The residual currents are weak so that they will be negligible for the large-scale circulation on long periods; 4) Finally, the sea-surface elevation forecast by the model is in close agreement with in-situ measurements of pressure in the Straits, performed during the GOGP 99 experiment...|$|R

40|$|Direct {{numerical}} simulations {{are performed}} {{to investigate the}} generation of internal waves in a linearly stratified fluid by oscillating barotropic flows over a model continental shelf-slope topography. The presence of a third wave-beam emitted from an abrupt shelf break and transverse to the topography, {{which has not been}} adequately interpreted, is now explained in terms of a geometric constraint provided by the topography. This explanation applies to wave beam selection at any abrupt topographic junction point, no matter whether it is convex or concave, or its nearby slope is subcritical or supercritical. One exception is that, at an abrupt concave point with a nearby supercritical slope, the blocking effect leads to the presence of "dead water" (i. e., no flow) and thus no wave beam is emitted. On a critical slope, two beams with opposite directions are emitted from an <b>amphidromic</b> <b>point</b> that has a distinct distance from the shelf break. In addition to the internal wave dispersion relation that restricts possible wave beam directions to form an X-pattern, the geometric constraint proposed in the present work serves as a second selection mechanism that further restricts wave beam directions. The reflective direction of a wave beam incident onto a slope can also be explained by this geometric constraint. The present work provides an updated explanation of internal wave beams emitted at abrupt topographic junction points and unifies the explanation of the wave beam direction for both wave generation and reflection processes.

5000|$|Flinders {{coined the}} term [...] "dodge tide" [...] in {{reference}} to his 1802/3 observations that the tides in the very shallow Spencer and St Vincent's Gulfs seemed to be completely inert for several days, at select locations. Such phenomena have now also {{been found in the}} Gulf of Mexico and in the Irish Sea. Taylor noticed that the apparent <b>amphidromic</b> <b>points</b> in the Irish Sea to be ephemeral, contrary to Laplace's theory. He also noted that the current shears often exceeded the Reynolds stability limit. Taylor and later workers determined these aperiodic phenomena to be a consequence of the Irish Sea being shallow and can be comparable to the thickness of the bottom boundary layer. In both the Irish Sea and the two South Australian gulfs, a north bound wave from the open ocean interferes non-linearly and with a reflected and weaker southbound wave, resulting in aperiodc and very dissipative tidal motions. The total dissipation of these two very large gulfs has not yet been calculated. The shallow Bering Sea dissipates some 50% of global input power. These ocean dissipative hot spots are alone capable of preventing the Gerstenkorn catastrophe of seas turned to steam and highly elliptical planetary orbits, by providing a rapid and non-geological energy sink.|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the role of}} wave-driven circulation relative to wind and buoyancy forcing in a coral reef–lagoon system. Circulation measurements in Paopao Bay, Moorea, French Polynesia, during austral summer show the importance of waves in driving flows over the reef crest, through the lagoon, and out the reef pass. Tides were comparatively weak, due to proximity to <b>amphidromic</b> <b>points,</b> and exhibited an unusual spring–neap cycle where the major lunar tide modulated the major solar tide, and the overall tidal phase stayed approximately constant. Wind had only a secondary effect compared to surface waves. A simple fluid mass balance indicated rapid flushing of the shallow back reef and export through the reef pass, and a reef capture zone width of, 2. 3 km. The reef pass circulation dynamics exhibited two-layer baroclinic exchange flow when waves were small, which was suppressed during large wave events. The unusually weak tidal forcing provided an opportunity to more closely investigate wave-driven circulation dynamics. As expected theoretically, there was a wave-driven setup of the free surface across the shallow lagoon, which drove a highly frictional flow, evident by a large drag coefficient CD < 0. 1. Diverging from extant theory, the observed setup varied strongly with significant wave height and period. Overall, the circulation and exchange between this coral reef system and the adjacent open ocean were largely determined by episodic remote-forcing events and differed significantly from periodic tidal-exchange mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|An {{idealized}} {{model for}} tide propagation and amplification in semi-enclosed rectangular basins is presented, accounting for depth differences {{by a combination}} of longitudinal and lateral topographic steps. The basin geometry is formed by several adjacent compartments of identical width, each having either a uniform depth or two depths separated by a transverse topographic step. The problem is forced by an incoming Kelvin wave at the open end, while allowing waves to radiate outward. The solution in each compartment is written as the superposition of (semi) -analytical wave solutions in an infinite channel, individually satisfying the depth-averaged linear shallow water equations on the f plane, including bottom friction. A collocation technique is employed to satisfy continuity of elevation and flux across the longitudinal topographic steps between the compartments. The model results show that the tidal wave in shallow parts displays slower propagation, enhanced dissipation and amplified amplitudes. This reveals a resonance mechanism, occurring when the length of the shallow end is roughly an odd multiple of the quarter Kelvin wavelength. Alternatively, for sufficiently wide basins, also Poincaré waves may become resonant. A transverse step implies different wavelengths of the incoming and reflected Kelvin wave, leading to increased amplitudes in shallow regions and a shift of <b>amphidromic</b> <b>points</b> {{in the direction of the}} deeper part. Including the shallow parts near the basin’s closed end (thus capturing the Kelvin resonance mechanism) is essential to reproduce semi-diurnal and diurnal tide observations in the Gulf of California, the Adriatic Sea and the Persian Gulf.
