25|$|Secondary batteries, {{also known}} as {{secondary}} cells, or rechargeable batteries, must be charged before first use; they are usually assembled with <b>active</b> <b>materials</b> in the discharged state. Rechargeable batteries are (re)charged by applying electric current, which reverses the chemical reactions that occur during discharge/use. Devices to supply the appropriate current are called chargers.|$|E
25|$|Primary batteries, or primary cells, {{can produce}} current {{immediately}} on assembly. These are {{most commonly used}} in portable devices that have low current drain, are used only intermittently, or are used well away from an alternative power source, such as in alarm and communication circuits where other electric power is only intermittently available. Disposable primary cells cannot be reliably recharged, since the chemical reactions are not easily reversible and <b>active</b> <b>materials</b> may not return to their original forms. Battery manufacturers recommend against attempting to recharge primary cells. In general, these have higher energy densities than rechargeable batteries, but disposable batteries do not fare well under high-drain applications with loads under 75 ohms (75 Ω). Common types of disposable batteries include zinc–carbon batteries and alkaline batteries.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} a {{mathematical}} model for describing the performance of lithium-ion battery electrodes consisting of porous <b>active</b> <b>material</b> particles is presented. The model represents {{an extension of the}} Newman-type model, accounting for the Agglomerate structure of the <b>active</b> <b>material</b> particles, here Li(Ni 1 / 3 Co 1 / 3 Mn 1 / 3) O 2 (NCM) and Li(Ni 1 / 3 Co 1 / 3 Al 1 / 3) O 2 (NCA). To this goal, an additional pore space is introduced on the <b>active</b> <b>material</b> level. The space is filled with electrolyte and a charge-transfer reaction takes place at the liquid-solid interface within the porous <b>active</b> <b>material</b> particles. Volume-averaging techniques are used to derive the model equations. A local Thiele modulus is defined and provides an insight into the potentially limiting factors on the <b>active</b> <b>material</b> level. The introduction of a liquid-phase ion transport within the <b>active</b> <b>material</b> reduces the overall transport losses, while the additional active surface area within the agglomerate lowers the charge-transfer resistance. As a consequence, calculated discharge capacities are higher for particles modeled as agglomerates. This finding is more pronounced in the case of high C-rates...|$|R

At {{least one of the}} linear drives comprises two parallel, <b>active</b> <b>material</b> surface areas, between which the passive material surface areas are arranged. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The arrangement includes {{at least two}} lenses or lens groups arranged on a common optic axis, whose positions are individually or commonly in direction of the optic axis, adjustable in reference to an assembly group connected firmly with an optic instrument. The lenses or lens groups are coupled with piezoelectric or electro-restrictive, linear drives to provide a position change, whereby an <b>active</b> <b>material</b> surface area, undergoing micro-deformation, faces a passive material surface area, and whereby a movement of both material sur face areas is triggered with respect to each other.

40|$|A cycled {{aerospace}} nickel hydrogen (Ni/H 2) cell {{was subjected}} to destructive physical analysis to determine the reason for a capacity loss after 5, 967 cycles at 60 percent depth of discharge.
