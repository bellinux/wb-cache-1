5|$|A deeper analogy relates tidal {{forces with}} a {{property}} of surfaces called curvature. For gravitational fields, the absence or presence of tidal forces determines {{whether or not}} the influence of gravity can be eliminated by choosing a freely falling reference frame. Similarly, the absence or presence of curvature determines whether or not a surface is equivalent to <b>a</b> <b>plane.</b> <b>In</b> the summer of 1912, inspired by these analogies, Einstein searched for a geometric formulation of gravity.|$|E
5|$|After 1971, {{particularly}} {{after the release}} of Fireball, Gillan started to become disillusioned with the workload of the band, who had not had any holiday since their initial rehearsals at Hanwell. He started drinking, and relationships between him {{and the rest of the}} band became strained, particularly with Blackmore. On 6 November 1971, he collapsed with hepatitis while waiting to board <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>in</b> Chicago, cancelling the remainder of a US tour.|$|E

5|$|In the Milky Way it {{has been}} {{discovered}} that {{the large majority of}} the low metallicity clusters are aligned along <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>in</b> the outer part of the galaxy's halo. This result argues in favor of the view that type II clusters in the galaxy were captured from a satellite galaxy, rather than being the oldest members of the Milky Way's globular cluster system as had been previously thought. The difference between the two cluster types would then be explained by a time delay between when the two galaxies formed their cluster systems.|$|E
5|$|The album embraces {{a form of}} {{symbolism}} {{that would}} eventually become a staple of Morrison's songs, equating earthly love and heaven, or as close as a living being can approach it.

5|$|Because Jacob {{mentioned}} hearing <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>in</b> the woods, Carl {{asks the}} brothers to assist an FBI agent, Neil Baxter, {{in a search}} for the missing aircraft. Hank and Jacob meet with Baxter and Carl at the police station. Sarah grows skeptical of Baxter, whom she later discovers to be an impostor; she contacts and warns Hank, who steals a handgun from Carl's office. The four men head into the woods and split up. When he finds the plane, Baxter kills Carl, and engages in a gunfight with Hank. Hank manages to kill Baxter with the gun he had stolen. Hank starts to concoct another story to tell the authorities. Jacob however announces that {{he does not want to}} live with these bad memories; he threatens to shoot himself to end it. He then encourages Hank to kill him instead and frame Baxter for the crime. After grappling with the decision, Hank kills Jacob.|$|E

5|$|Hank Mitchell and {{his wife}} Sarah live in rural Minnesota. One of the town's few college graduates, Hank works in a feed mill, while his wife is a librarian. When Hank, his older, {{socially}} challenged brother Jacob and Jacob's friend Lou chase a fox into the woods, they stumble upon a crashed airplane. Hank decides to look inside the plane where he discovers a dead pilot and a bag containing $4.4 million in $100 bills. He suggests turning the money in but is persuaded not to by Jacob and Lou. Hank then proposes that he keep the money safe at his house {{until the end of}} winter. Sheriff Carl Jenkins drives by the area and notices the three men after they hide the money in Jacob's pick-up truck. Jacob mentions hearing <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>in</b> the area to avoid suspicion. After Carl leaves, the three men decide to keep the money a secret, but Hank breaks the pact when he reveals the discovery to Sarah.|$|E

25|$|The {{analysis}} of structures is often accomplished by plotting the orientations of various features onto stereonets. A stereonet is a stereographic projection of a sphere onto <b>a</b> <b>plane,</b> <b>in</b> which planes are projected as lines and lines are projected as points. These {{can be used}} to find the locations of fold axes, relationships between faults, and relationships between other geologic structures.|$|E
25|$|Another way {{to imagine}} wormholes {{is to take}} a sheet of paper and draw two {{somewhat}} distant points {{on one side of the}} paper. The sheet of paper represents <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>in</b> the spacetime continuum, and the two points represent a distance to be traveled, however theoretically a wormhole could connect these two points by folding that plane so the points are touching. In this way it would be much easier to traverse the distance since the two points are now touching.|$|E
25|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{determined}} {{that the cause of}} the accident was pilot error. The pilots failed to switch on the engines' internal ice protection systems, used reverse thrust in a snowstorm prior to takeoff, tried to use the jet exhaust of <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>in</b> front of them to melt their own ice, and failed to abort the takeoff even after detecting a power problem while taxiing and visually identifying ice and snow buildup on the wings.|$|E

25|$|For three variables, each linear {{equation}} determines <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>in</b> three-dimensional space, and the solution set is {{the intersection of}} these planes. Thus the solution set may be a plane, a line, a single point, or the empty set. For example, as three parallel planes {{do not have a}} common point, the solution set of their equations is empty; the solution set of the equations of three planes intersecting at a point is single point; if three planes pass through two points, their equations have at least two common solutions; in fact the solution set is infinite and consists in all the line passing through these points.|$|E
25|$|On September 23, 1974, a {{group of}} Pan Am {{employees}} published an advertisement in The New York Times to register their disagreement over federal policies which they felt were harming the financial viability of their employer. The ad cited discrepancies in airport landing fees, such as Pan Am paying $4,200 to land <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> <b>in</b> Sydney, while the Australian carrier, Qantas, paid only $178 to land a jet in Los Angeles. The ad also contended that the United States Postal Service was paying foreign airlines {{five times as much}} to carry U.S. mail in comparison to Pan Am. Finally, the ad questioned why the Export-Import Bank of the United States loaned money to Japan, France, and Saudi Arabia at 6% interest while Pan Am paid 12%.|$|E
25|$|In 1899 the {{astronomer}} Karl Schwarzschild pointed out an observation about double stars. The motion of two stars orbiting {{each other is}} planar, the two orbits {{of the stars of}} the system lie in <b>a</b> <b>plane.</b> <b>In</b> the case of sufficiently near double star systems, it can be seen from Earth whether the perihelion of the orbits of the two stars remains pointing in the same direction with respect to the solar system. Schwarzschild pointed out that that was invariably seen: the direction of the angular momentum of all observed double star systems remains fixed with respect to the direction of the angular momentum of the Solar system. The logical inference is that just like gyroscopes, the angular momentum of all celestial bodies is angular momentum with respect to a universal inertial space.|$|E
