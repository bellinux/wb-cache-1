40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that the emission of gravitational waves at the merger of two black holes gives a kick to the final black hole. If the supermassive black hole {{at the center of a}} disk galaxy is kicked but the velocity is not large enough to escape from the host galaxy, it will fall back onto the the disk and accrete the interstellar medium in the disk. We study the X-ray emission from the black holes with masses of ~ 10 ^ 7 M_sun recoiled from the galactic center with velocities of ~ 600 km s^- 1. We find that their luminosities can reach ~> 10 ^ 39 erg s^- 1, when they pass the <b>apastrons</b> in the disk. While the X-ray luminosities are comparable to those of ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) observed in disk galaxies, ULXs observed so far do not seem to be such supermassive black holes. Statical studies could constrain the probability of merger and recoil of supermassive black holes. Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ Letter...|$|R
40|$|A {{binary star}} {{system is the}} most common result of the star {{formation}} process, and binary companions can disrupt both the formation of terrestrial planets and their long term prospects for stability. We present results from a large set of numerical simulations of the final stages of terrestrial planet formation - from Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos to planets - in main-sequence binary star systems. We examine planetary accretion around both stars ('P-type' circumbinary orbits) or individual stars ('S-type' orbits) in binary systems, including terrestrial planet formation around each star in Alpha Centauri AB, the closest binary star system to the Sun. For comparison, we also simulate planetary growth from the same initial disk placed in the Sun-Jupiter-Saturn system and also around the Sun with neither giant planets nor a stellar companion perturbing the system. Our simulations show that giant and stellar companions not only truncate the disk, but hasten the accretion process by stirring up the planetary embryos to higher eccentricities and inclinations. Terrestrial planets similar to those in our Solar System formed around individual stars in simulations with the binary periastron (closest approach) greater than about 5 AU. Terrestrial planet growth within circumbinary disks was uninhibited around inner binary star systems with binary <b>apastrons</b> (maximum separation) less than ~ 0. 2 AU. Results from our simulations can be scaled for different stellar and disk parameters. Approximately 50 - 60 % of binary star systems - from contact binaries to separations of nearly a parsec - satisfy these constraints. Given that the galaxy contains more than 100 billion star systems, a large number of systems remain habitable based on the dynamic considerations of this research.

500|$|According {{to current}} definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any {{potential}} [...] "rogue planets" [...] are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun {{in the same}} direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its <b>apastron</b> (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches <b>apastron,</b> its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was only}} in 2017 that a paper by Kervella, et al., showed that, based on high {{precision}} radial velocity measurements and {{with a high degree}} of confidence, Proxima and Alpha Centauri are in fact gravitationally bound.

2500|$|The {{orbit of}} an Earth-like planet {{would need to}} be {{centered}} within 0.68 AU (around the orbital distance of Venus), which in a Keplerian system means a 240-day orbital period.

Also, observation has ruled out Neptune-class or heavier planets with a period of one year or less; which still allows for Earth-sized planets at 0.6 AU or more.|$|E
2500|$|The {{orbit of}} a planet around the Sun is an ellipse, with the Sun {{in one of the}} focal points of that ellipse. [...] The planet's orbit lies in a plane, called the orbital plane. The point on the orbit closest to the {{attracting}} body is the periapsis. The point farthest from the attracting body is called the apoapsis. There are also specific terms for orbits about particular bodies; things orbiting the Sun have a perihelion and aphelion, things orbiting the Earth have a perigee and apogee, and things orbiting the Moon have a perilune and apolune (or periselene and aposelene respectively). An orbit around any star, not just the Sun, has a periastron and an <b>apastron.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A {{planetary}} {{object that}} orbits a star with high orbital eccentricity may spend {{only some of}} its year in the CHZ and experience a large variation in temperature and atmospheric pressure. This would result in dramatic seasonal phase shifts where liquid water may exist only intermittently. It is possible that subsurface habitats could be insulated from such changes and that extremophiles {{on or near the}} surface might survive through adaptions such as hibernation (cryptobiosis) and/or hyperthermostability. Tardigrades, for example, can survive in a dehydrated state temperatures between [...] and [...] Life on a planetary object orbiting outside CHZ might hibernate on the cold side as the planet approaches the <b>apastron</b> where the planet is coolest and become active on approach to the periastron when the planet is sufficiently warm.|$|E

50|$|On average, the {{two stars}} are {{separated}} by 9.5 AUs, which is roughly the average distance of Saturn from the Sun. However, their eccentric mutual orbit causes their distance to vary between 5.5 AUs at periastron, to 13.5 at <b>apastron.</b>|$|E

50|$|Halvmörk's {{orbiting}} period (year) is {{a little}} over eight Earth years. Its orbit is extremely elliptic, and the inclination of its axis is 41°, so seasonal changes have an enormous effect on the weather.

50|$|Unlike {{the planets}} in the Solar System, the planet's orbit is highly elliptical, and its {{distance}} varies from 0.54 AU at periastron to 2.8 AU at <b>apastron.</b> This high eccentricity {{may have been}} caused by tidal interactions in the binary star system, and the planet's orbit may vary chaotically between low and high-eccentricity states over a period of tens of millions of years.|$|E
