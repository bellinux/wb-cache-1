5|$|Among {{both the}} Maguindanao and the Maranao, the agung embodies {{all that is}} {{masculine}} and thus the agung is traditionally considered <b>a</b> <b>masculine</b> instrument. To be considered a good player, one must possess strength, stamina (playing extremely fast tempos with no mistakes) and endurance. Players must also exhibit improvisation skills for different patterns to be considered as having quality musicianship—lest the audience considers the patterns played repetitions and mundane.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} shared {{association}} with skiing {{and the fact}} that both place names referring to Ullr and Skaði appear most frequently in Sweden, some scholars have proposed a particular connection between the two gods. On the other hand, Skaði may potentially be <b>a</b> <b>masculine</b> form and, as a result, some scholars have theorized that Skaði may have originally been a male deity.|$|E

5|$|Although Hall's author's note disclaims any {{real-world}} {{basis for}} the ambulance unit that Stephen joins, she drew heavily on the wartime experiences of her friend Toupie Lowther, co-commander of the only women's unit {{to serve on the}} front in France. Lowther, like Stephen, came from an aristocratic family, adopted <b>a</b> <b>masculine</b> style of dress, and was an accomplished fencer, tennis player, motorist and jujitsu enthusiast. In later years she said the character of Stephen was based on her, which may have been partly true.|$|E

25|$|The {{formation}} of feminine nouns from masculine nouns is a productive process.

The semantic {{value of the}} feminine derivation is variable.|$|E

25|$|Breed {{standards}} describe Doberman Pinschers as dogs of medium-large size with {{a square}} build and short coat. They are compactly built and athletic with endurance and swiftness. The Doberman Pinscher {{should have a}} proud, watchful, determined, and obedient temperament.

25|$|Surnames {{ending with}} consonants usually have no {{additional}} feminine form. In the past, when the masculine form {{ended in a}} consonant, the feminine surname could have been derived by adding the suffix, -owa, indicating ownership. For example, Cezaria Baudouin de Courtenay, after her marriage to Janusz Jędrzejewicz, was named Cezaria Baudouin de Courtenay Ehrenkreutz Jędrzejewiczowa.

25|$|In {{the middle}} of the 20th century most {{habitual}} speakers of Irish still lived in the Gaeltacht, but the number of urban readers was growing.

These stories were praised for their scope and their skilful adaptation of the language to an urban environment.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{procedure}} {{occurs with}} masculine names, but using a reverse order. It {{is not unusual}} to find masculine names such as João Maria, José Maria, Manuel Maria, Luís Maria etc. In this case, Maria would always be the second given name, in honour of the Virgin Mary, and the first name would be <b>a</b> <b>masculine</b> name. This custom is fashionable among the Portuguese and Brazilian nobility and the upper classes, but is considered tacky in Brazilian society.|$|E
