40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to create an}} {{automatic}} scaling implementation for Cassandra clusters. The <b>automatic</b> <b>scaler</b> should never lower the overall performance of the cluster in a way that results in a bad user experience. It should also be able to successfully scale up and down nodes, and the cluster should continue as if nothing happened. Last but not least, it is desirable that the <b>automatic</b> <b>scaler</b> performs equally, or better than, the person {{who is in charge of}} administrating the database. In this thesis we have developed an early version of an autoscaler that may run alongside a Cassandra instance. The implementation is split into two separate implementations: a master-, and an agent-implementation. The master will be deployed to the same server as the application using the cluster, even though this is not required. The agent implementation will be deployed to, and run alongside, all nodes that are a part of the cluster. The agent will monitor the node`s resource usage, and send messages back to the master if the usage increases above, or decreases below certain thresholds. We performed a set of test cases to prove that the implementation works as intended. The test cases recorded the nodes resource-usage to determine the impact our implementation makes to the overall performance...|$|E

The elapsed counting time is read by a 115 V AC clock to 0. 01 minute. Manual operation is provided to allow the scaler to be run for a fixed time interval in which case every 10, 000 counts are recorded by a Cyclotron recording meter. The instrument has a two pulse resolution time of 25 microseconds. Four decades in cascade {{are used in the}} scaler, one of which has a resolution time of 8 microseconds; the other three, a resolution time of 30 microseconds. Ten neon bulbs are used in each decade to indicate the count. An <b>automatic</b> decade <b>scaler</b> {{which operates}} for a fixed number of counts has been developed for use with a Geiger tube.

30|$|Extraction and {{interpretation}} of the signal traces in recorded ionogram images is an intelligent, machine-hard problem of feature recognition. The GIRO provides access to the <b>Automatic</b> Real-Time Ionogram <b>Scaler</b> with True height (ARTIST) software, an “autoscaler” of ionogram traces that uses the heritage of algorithm development {{going back to the}} 1980 s (Reinisch and Huang, 1983; Galkin et al., 2008 b). About 7 % of available GIRO ionograms underwent a labor-intensive process of manually validating the autoscaling results. As of November 3, 2010 the DIDBase repository holds 733, 516 records of expert-level manual ionogram scaling.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Beginning in December 2007, UMLCAR is {{conducting}} a network-wide upgrade of the <b>Automatic</b> Real-Time Ionogram <b>Scaler</b> with True height (ARTIST), the ionogram autoscaling software developed for Digisondes. The new ARTIST Version 5 revamps classic, well-seasoned ARTIST 4 techniques for the modern computers and programming environments. It also implements new approaches developed to strengthen the ARTIST persona. Special attention has been directed to the characterization of the Autoscaling Confidence Level (ACL) and provision of the uncertainty bounds for the automatically scaled characteristics and derived electron density profiles in order to properly ingest them in assimilative ionospheric models. The new SAO. XML format for ionogram-derived data is used to report ARTIST 5 data. The paper describes progress in the ionogram autoscaling research at UMLCAR that has culminated into release of the ARTIST 5 upgrade...|$|R

(2018 a, b), the {{reliability}} of foF 2 and M(3000)F 2 autoscaled data was based on a quality check of ionograms: for the reference stations equipped with the <b>Automatic</b> Real-Time Ionogram <b>Scaler</b> with True height analysis (ARTIST) software (Reinisch and Huang 1983; Reinisch et al. 2005; Galkin and Reinisch 2008), only ionograms with a Confidence Score (CS) greater than 75 (see [URL] were selected; for the reference stations equipped with the Autoscala software (Scotto and Pezzopane 2002, 2008; Pezzopane and Scotto 2005, 2007; Scotto 2009; Scotto et al. 2012), a careful visual inspection was adopted to select the reliable ionograms. Furthermore, to avoid unrealistic IG 12 eff and R 12 eff maps, a preliminary quality check of the variogram model, based on the exponent s of the power variogram model was also implemented.|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} uncertainties about density {{profiles in}} the topside ionosphere, i. e., in the height regime from hmF 2 to approx. 2000 km, requires {{the search for}} new data sources. Millions of ionograms had been recorded by the ISIS and Alouette satellites in the sixties and seventies, that never were analyzed in terms of electron density profiles. In recent years an effort started to digitize the analog recordings to prepare the ionograms for computerized analysis. This paper shows how the digital ionograms are processed and the electron density profiles (from satellite orbit altitude, 1400 km for ISIS- 2, down to the F peak) are calculated. The {{most difficult part of}} the task is the automatic scaling of the echo traces in the ISIS ionograms. Unlike the ionograms from modern ionosondes, the ISIS ionograms do not identify the wave polarization of the different echo traces, so physical logic must be applied to identify the ordinary ()) and extraordinary (X) traces, and this is not always successful. Characteristic resonance features seen in the topside ionograms occur at the gyro and plasma frequencies. An elaborate scheme was developed to identify these resonance frequencies {{in order to determine the}} local plasma and gyrofrequencies. This information helps in the identification of the O and X traces, and it provides the starting density of the electron density profile. The inversion of the echo traces into electron density profiles uses the same modified Chebyshev polynomial fitting technique that is successfully applied in the ground-based Digisonde network. The <b>automatic</b> topside ionogram <b>scaler</b> with true height algorithm TOPIST is successfully scaling approx. 70 % of the ionograms. An 'editing process' is available to manually scale the more difficult ionograms. The home page for the ISIS project is at [URL] It provides access to as of January 2001, 3000, 000 digitized ISIS ionogram data and to related software. A search page lets users select data location, time, and a host of other search criteria. The automated processing of the ISIS ionograms will begin later this year and the electron density profiles will be made available from the project home page. The ISIS data restoration efforts are supported through NASA's Applied Systems and Information Research Program...|$|R
