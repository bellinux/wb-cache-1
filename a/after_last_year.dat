50|$|This {{two years}} {{were the best}} years of their careers. Both players were ranked No. 1 in 2008 and also they had their best grand slam results, with Ivanovic winning Roland Garros trophy, after {{reaching}} first two Grand Slam finals previously and Jankovic who got into her first Grand Slam final in New York and also reached 3 semi-finals previously. So, normally in this period they had most clashes. Total matches that they played then is 6, with three meetings in 2007 and another three in 2008.Ivanovic won first five matches of this six, although three of them gone into the third set. First match was in quarterfinal of Tokyo when Ivanovic triumphed after losing first set, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2. In 2006 Ivanovic won just one match after losing first set, but now won two back-to-back matches in that way, doing the same in previous round. Jankovic gave a big battle comparing to semifinal match against then World No. 1 Maria Sharapova, when Sharapova retried against Ivanovic, but after a first set blowout, 6-1. Next match was on Amelia Island, again quarterfinal, when Ivanovic won in two sets, 7-5, 6-3. But this match was just 15 minutes shorter than previous match in Tokyo, which was in three sets. Duration of this match shows that it was a big battle, although it were two sets. They met then for a second time in Los Angeles, <b>after</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> quarterfinal clash which Jankovic won. Ivanovic won, but now in three sets - 4-6, 6-3, 7-5. This was the longest match contested between the two. In a match lasting two and a half hours, Ivanovic recovered from a 4-1 third set deficit, saving two match points en route, to defeat Janković {{on her way to the}} title. It was their last match of 2007.|$|E
50|$|Robbe-Grillet {{then went}} on to launch a career as a writer-director of a series of {{cerebral}} and often sexually provocative feature films which explored similar themes to those in his literary work (e.g. Voyeurism, The Body as Text, The 'Double'). He commenced with L'Immortelle (The Immortal One) (1962) which won the much-coveted Louis Delluc Prize of 1962. This was followed by his most commercially successful film <b>after</b> <b>Last</b> <b>Year</b> at Marienbad: Trans-Europ-Express (1966) starring Jean-Louis Trintignant, who continued to work with Robbe-Grillet on his next four films: his French-Slovak film L'homme qui ment/Muž, ktorý luže (The Man Who Lies) (1968), L'Eden et après/Eden a potom (Eden and After) (1970), Glissements progressifs du plaisir (Progressive Slidings towards Pleasure) (1974) and Le jeu avec le feu (Playing with Fire) (1975). It was almost a decade before the appearance of his next feature film, La belle captive (The Beautiful Captive) (1983), but Alain Robbe-Grillet was fortunate enough to enlist the services of Henri Alekan as cinematographer, the visionary master of cinematography for the films of Jean Cocteau. Subsequently more than a decade passed before Alain Robbe-Grillet got behind the lens again, this time filming a mystery thriller on a small Greek island with Fred Ward starring as the confused Frank in Un bruit qui rend fou. Robbe-Grillet (A Maddening Noise, aka: The Blue Villa) (1995). Before his death in 2008 Robbe-Grillet was to direct one more film, Gradiva (C'est Gradiva qui vous appelle) (2006) which brought once more to the fore his preoccupation with sadism and bondage in his fiction. Perhaps the best introduction to the film works of Alain Robbe-Grillet is the volume The Erotic Dream Machine by Professors Roch C.Smith and Anthony N. Fragola. Also of great value is the volume In the Temple of Dreams: The Writer on the Screen in which Robbe-Grillet himself explains the relationship between his literary fiction and his cinematic fiction (ed. Edouard d'Araille, 1996).|$|E
