25|$|William Ensign Lincoln {{invented the}} {{definitive}} zoetrope in 1865 {{when he was}} circa 18 years old and a sophomore at Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island. Lincoln's patented version had the viewing slits on a level above the pictures, which allowed the use of easily replaceable strips of images. It also had an illustrated paper disc on the base, which was not always exploited on the commercially produced versions. On advice of a local bookstore owner, Lincoln sent a model to color lithographers and board game manufacturers Milton Bradley and Co. Some shop owners advertised the zoetrope in American newspapers in December 1866. The instrument was first patented in the U.K. on 6 March 1867 under no. 629 by Henry Watson Hallett (as a communication to him by Milton Bradley). In the United States it was patented as the Zoëtrope on April 23, 1867 by William E. Lincoln – as an <b>assignor</b> to Milton Bradley. Over the years Milton Bradley released at least seven numbered series with twelve zoetrope strips each, {{as well as a}} set of twelve strips by Professor Robert Hallowell Richards showing the gradual transformations from one isometric form to another, and one separately available strip showing the progress of the Grecian bend (a woman morphing into a camel). The London Stereoscopic & Photographic Company was licensed as the British publisher and repeated most of the Milton Bradley animations, while adding a set of twelve animations by famous British illustrator George Cruikshank in 1870.|$|E

2500|$|The Skycar I {{was first}} {{displayed}} at the spring 1931 Detroit Show. The aircraft was a two-seat high-wing monoplane, accommodating the occupants in tandem layout. It had an all-metal steel-tube frame covered with corrugated metal skin. Centre-line nose and tail-wheels plus a standard landing gear were fitted. The rear fuselage was constructed from an open framework carrying a single fin and rudder, inside which was located the rear pusher engine. The Sky Car was displayed with a Moorhouse engine (Alfred Moorhouse of Detroit, <b>assignor</b> to Packard Motor Car Company). Fuel was carried in two tanks in the leading portion of the central section of the engine housing, from where it was fed by gravity to the engine. At a later date the aircraft was fitted with twin booms carrying the single fin and rudder (see photo of preserved aircraft). The aircraft featured balanced pivoting outboard wingtips rather than ailerons. Stout attempted to design a simple aircraft that would have controls similar to early model Fords including the ignition switch and the starter button. Stout planned to build the Sky Car (i.e. its original name was [...] "Sky Car" [...] but various newspaper and magazine articles spelled it [...] "Skycar") [...] and sell it {{at the price of}} a moderately priced car (approximately $2000) if mass-produced in numbers.|$|E

6000|$|... "When {{you were}} here last summer," [...] began Prince, leaning forward over his desk, [...] "you brought me a piece of news that astounded me, as it did many others. It was the {{assignment}} of Dr. West's property to Mrs. Saltonstall. That was something there was no gainsaying; it was a purely business affair, and involved nobody's rights but the <b>assignor.</b> But this was followed, {{a day or two}} after, by the announcement of the Doctor's will, making the same lady the absolute and sole inheritor of the same property. That seemed all right too; for there were, apparently, no legal heirs. Since then, however, it has been discovered that there is a legal heir--none other than the Doctor's only son. Now, as no allusion to the son's existence was made in that will--which was a great oversight of the Doctor's--it is a fiction of the law that such an omission is an act of forgetfulness, and therefore leaves the son the same rights as if there had been no will at all. In other words, if the Doctor had seen fit to throw his scapegrace son a hundred dollar bill, it would have been legal evidence that he remembered him. As he did not, it's a fair legal presumption that he forgot him, or that the will is incomplete." ...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the dangers}} of {{harmonisation}} and unification processes taking place {{within the framework of the}} EU is that they may result in the codification of the lowest common denominator. This is precisely what is threatening to happen in respect of assignment. Referring the transfer of receivables by way of assignment to the law of the <b>assignor’s</b> residence, as article 13 of the Proposal does, would be opting for the most conservative solution and would for many Member States be a step backward rather than forward. A conflict rule referring assignment to the law of the <b>assignor's</b> residence is too rigid to do justice to the dynamic nature of assignments in cross-border transactions and it is unjustly one-sided. It offers no real advantages when compared to other conflict rules; it even has serious disadvantages which make the conflict rule unsuitable for efficient assignment-based cross-border transactions. It is not unconceivable that this conflict rule would even be contrary to the fundamental freedoms of the ECTreaty. The Community legislators in particular should be careful not to needlessly adopt rules which create insurmountable obstacles for cross-border business where choice-of-law by the parties would perfectly do. Community legislation has a special responsibility to create a smooth legal environment for single market transactions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the role}} that patents played {{in the establishment of}} the isotope industry. In the first part I survey the number of issued patents on the production of isotopes, also arguing that the isotope industry was typified by inadequate patenting activities. Then I examine the factors that hindered these activities by looking at the history of industrial patents in the establishment of the isotope industry. I especially focus on the consequences of the Manhattan Project on patent legislation. As the Atomic Energy Act (1946) made the isotope industry a monopoly of the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), it contributed to transform the trading of its relevant patents in a «contentious» business. Since then, inventors and <b>assignors</b> already in possession of isotope production patents could only claim compensation to the AEC, which was authorised to seize them. And those who might have outlined new inventions were now deprived of the economic incentive to do so, being prohibited from free-trading them in the international market...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{examines}} the law applicable to secured transactions. It addresses {{in particular the}} codification of the choice-of-law rules for secured transactions (STCOL rules). These rules address the laws applicable to the creation, perfection, priority, and enforcement of security interests (security rights) —a form of legislative or statutory dépeçage. It draws on the 2016 UNCITRAL Model Law on Secured Transactions (Model Law) as well as relevant North American law (Uniform Commercial Code Article 9 and the Canadian provincial Personal Property Security Acts). The STCOL rules {{lie at the heart}} of the emerged and emerging modern principles of secured transactions law (Modern Principles) for personal property (movable assets). These Modern Principles are reflected by the Model Law and North American law as well as by various other model laws, other secured transactions ‘reforms’ over recent years, and laws that are currently being considered by various States. While disagreements exist, debates continue, and strict harmonization is unlikely, there is little doubt that there has emerged a global consensus as to a set of general principles to which secured transactions law should adhere. The STCOL rules and their relationship to substantive legal doctrine remain somewhat underdeveloped and undertheorized. This essay seeks to remedy this situation. It situates the STCOL rules as fundamental components of secured transactions law and central to understanding the normative principles and factual assumptions underpinning that important body of law. Its principal contribution is to offer a framework for assessing the existing STCOL rules and for the codification of future rules. The framework is based on the interests of stakeholders that participate in or are affected by secured transactions and the Modern Principles. These stakeholders include third parties in general, <b>assignors</b> and assignees of security rights, third-party obligors on assigned assets (such as debtors on an <b>assignor’s</b> receivables), and the States that enact and whose interests are affected by STCOL rules. This framework also illuminates the factual bases for its application. But it can evaluated only through its application and analysis, which necessarily produces an assessment of STCOL rules and conclusions as to the appropriate rules. While the conclusions reached here may represent only a modest contribution to the literature, the more important offering is the framework for assessment itself—the identification of the questions to be asked and answered...|$|R
40|$|The Industrial Design Department of Eindhoven University of Technology is {{continuously}} {{developing and}} putting in practice a holistic and integrative educational approach, focusing on designing intelligent systems, products and related services for societal transformation. During the semester, each student {{is supported by}} a personal coach, by <b>assignors</b> and experts, who eventually provide feedbacks on the student’s learning, achievement, and reflection upon learning. During the end-of-term assessment, students are evaluated on their overall development (taking skills, knowledge, reflection, attitude and identity into account). After describing the rational of the educational system of TU/e and its process in practice, this paper focuses on the introduction of a new educational tool aiming at supporting education, assessment included: the Frame of Reference. The holistic quality of the educational system allows the personalisation of the entire student career. Therefore, there are as many visions and student paths as the number of students. Each student is different from others in terms of their knowledge, skills and experience. Consequently, no standardized criteria can be properly applied to the evaluation procedure. The Frame of Reference is structured as an intelligent space, both physical and virtual, and adaptive to the visitors’ expectations and experience. It offers referential works and development of design students (prototypes, reports, showcases…), illustrating stages of and processes for competency development and over-all development as a designer. The Frame of Reference is introduced and described as a place for sharing points of views and experiences, between students, coaches, experts, assessors, and external visitors. It is designed to inspire and to support students as well as staff, by creating a comprehensive and clearer, yet non-homogenous vision of what students throughout the department achieve, of how this is evaluated and how this contributes to students’ overall competence of designing...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Supply chain {{visibility}} {{is among}} the top concerns expressed by many supply chain leaders. While the traditional enablers of supply chain visibility are information sharing, IT implementation, and relationships between supply chain partners; the role of global supply chain standards {{as an integral part}} of each of these enablers is often underestimated. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the adoption and applicability of global supply chain standards within the provisions of supply chain visibility among various supply chain designs. Methodology. With the aim of theoretical replication, three case studies within the retail industry were conducted. Axfood and IKEA cases were analyzed as examples of opposite types of supply chain design and as companies with different degrees of implementation regarding their global data identification standards. The Clas Ohlson case was analyzed to illustrate a company with open paths in regards to its adoption of future global supply chain standards. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were performed directly with company representatives as well as with GS 1, which is one of the <b>assignors</b> of this project. Finally, an analytical model for the potential adoption of global standards was developed. Findings. The results of case analysis clearly illustrate that global data identification standards are one of the pillars of supply chain visibility. Different practices of global standard adoption in different supply chain designs are explained by a different need for supply chain visibility among various supply chains. Moreover, the higher the degree of adoption of global standards, the higher the possibility of gaining strategic benefits. Practical implication. The model developed in this research aims to help logistics and supply chain managers estimate the need for supply chain visibility within their supply chains, and to also assess the potential adoption of global data identification standards within their supply chain practices. Originality/value. This study contributes to theory in such areas of research as supply chain visibility, standardization in supply chain management, and supply chain design. The main contribution is made to the resource-based view (RBV) theory, which according to supply chain visibility can be seen as both a strategic resource and a tool for efficiency optimization. A new term in supply chain design which suggests many-to-many and exclusive supply chain classifications is proposed, as is a framework for assessing the need for supply chain visibility. An analytical model for the potential adoption of global standards is also developed.
