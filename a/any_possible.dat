5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{left the}} African coast on July22 and crossed {{much of the}} Atlantic without significant development. While approaching the Leeward Islands on July28, the National Hurricane Center monitored the system closely for <b>any</b> <b>possible</b> development, which did not occur at that time. Though by August2, convection began increasing, and as a result, the system developed into Tropical Depression Eight later that day, while centered about 350miles (595km) southwest of Bermuda. On the following day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Harvey. Due to initially strong wind shear, Harvey exhibited subtropical characteristics.|$|E

5|$|According to {{an early}} {{estimate}} by The Globe and Mail, 25,000 uniformed police officers, 1,000 security guards from Commissionaires Great Lakes, and several Canadian military forces were to be deployed during the summit. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) conducted Amalgam Virgo exercises on May 6 and 7 across the Greater Toronto Area using CF-18 Hornet jets, CH-124 Sea Kings, and CH-146 Griffon helicopters at low altitudes.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the attack, Diệm ordered that all VNAF {{aircraft}} be grounded, and all aerial combat missions suspended while his security officials investigated fighter pilots for <b>any</b> <b>possible</b> anti-regime tendencies. This was achieved by placing tanks on the runway at Bien Hoa Air Base. Without assistance from accompanying fighter craft, the U.S. deemed it too risky for American helicopters to operate in the jungles against the communists.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{formation}} of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled an invasion force, called the Armée d'Angleterre (Army of England) around six camps at Boulogne in Northern France. He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England, and was so confident of success that he had commemorative medals struck to celebrate the conquest of the English. Although they never invaded, Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for <b>any</b> <b>possible</b> military operation. Boredom among the troops occasionally set in, but Napoleon paid many visits and conducted lavish parades in order to boost morale.|$|E

This suspicion became stronger when a well-groomed man, who had approached the Order to serve as engineer and offer his wealth of knowledge about fortifications, disappeared shortly after having surveyed Malta's fortifications. Consequently, the Order began its preparations to counter <b>any</b> <b>possible</b> attack by the Ottoman army.|$|E
5|$|Infrared {{spectroscopy}} conducted from 2001 to 2005 {{revealed the}} presence of water ice as well as frozen carbon dioxide {{on the surface of}} Titania, which in turn suggested that the moon may have a tenuous carbon dioxide atmosphere with a surface pressure of about 10 nanopascals (10−13 bar).

The reports came shortly after AT had lowered the First's price from $99.99 to $0.99 on a two-year contract as a promotion; however, AT denied <b>any</b> <b>possible</b> connection to the device being possibly discontinued. In response to the issues, the release of the First on the British carriers EE and Orange was indefinitely delayed so Facebook could focus on making improvements to the Home software.|$|E

5|$|The County Divisions, {{including}} the Devon and Cornwall County Division, were around 10,000 men strong and assigned {{to defend the}} coastlines of threatened sections of the country, {{including the}} manning of coastal artillery. These divisions were largely static, lacking mobility and also divisional assets such as artillery, engineers, and reconnaissance forces. Using the recruits in this manner allowed the regular infantry divisions to be freed up from such duties, undertake training, and form an all-important reserve {{that could be used}} to counterattack <b>any</b> <b>possible</b> German landing.|$|E
5|$|The Senate Ethics Committee did not pursue, {{for lack}} of jurisdiction, <b>any</b> <b>possible</b> ethics {{breaches}} in McCain's delayed reimbursements to Keating for trips at the latter's expense, because they occurred while McCain was in the House.

5|$|With the {{resumption}} of hostilities after the Peace of Amiens, Murray returned to sea {{in command of the}} 74-gun , but word soon reached him that Nelson had requested him to be his captain of the fleet in the Mediterranean. Murray was initially reluctant to accept the offer, and on being asked why, replied that the nature of the service was such, as very frequently terminated in disagreement between the admiral and the captain; and he should be extremely unwilling to hazard <b>any</b> <b>possible</b> thing that should diminish the regard and respect which he should ever entertain for his lordship.|$|E
5|$|Anomalies and malformations of the pinna are common. These {{anomalies}} include chromosome syndromes such as ring 18. Children {{may also}} present cases of abnormal ear canals and low ear implantation. In rare cases no pinna is formed (atresia), or is extremely small (microtia). Small pinnae can develop when the auricular hillocks do not develop properly. The ear canal can fail to develop {{if it does}} not channelise properly or if there is an obstruction. Reconstructive surgery to treat hearing loss is considered as an option for children older than five, with a cosmetic surgical procedure to reduce the size or change the shape of the ear is called an otoplasty. The initial medical intervention is aimed at assessing the baby's hearing and the condition of the ear canal, as well as the middle and inner ear. Depending on the results of tests, reconstruction of the outer ear is done in stages, with planning for <b>any</b> <b>possible</b> repairs {{of the rest of the}} ear.|$|E
5|$|As Bonds neared Aaron's record, Aaron {{was called}} on for {{his opinion of}} Bonds. He {{clarified}} {{that he was a}} fan and admirer of Bonds and avoided the controversy regarding whether the record should be denoted with an asterisk for Bonds's alleged steroid usage. He felt recognition and respect for the award was something to be determined by the fans. As the steroid controversy received greater media attention during the offseason before the 2005 season, Aaron expressed some reservations about the statements Bonds made on the issue. Aaron expressed that he felt drug and steroid use to boost athletic performance was inappropriate. Aaron was frustrated that the media could not focus on events that occurred in the field of play and wished drugs or gambling allegations such as those associated with Pete Rose could be emphasized less. In 2007, Aaron felt the whole steroid use issue was very controversial and decided that he would not attend <b>any</b> <b>possible</b> record-breaking games. Aaron congratulated Bonds through the media including a video played on the scoreboard when Bonds eventually broke Aaron's record in August 2007.|$|E
