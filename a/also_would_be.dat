5|$|As {{investigation}} and planning work continued, the Corps of Engineers {{reached an agreement}} with the Department of the Interior, the parent agency of the Bureau of Reclamation, in March 1962. The agreement stated the Corps would have responsibility for design and construction of the project, while the Interior Department would be responsible for running and maintaining the dam after completion. In the planning stages, the Interior Department <b>also</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> responsible for examining the economic feasibility of the project and its effect upon natural resources. This agreement negated much of the work of the REAB to that point, as the Interior Department promptly began its own three-year study of the dam's economic feasibility and environmental impact. The DRC report, though trumped by the Interior Department's new precedence in such matters, nevertheless released a report in April 1962, stating that the project was economically feasible and would attract new industries to Alaska. Meanwhile, the Corps of Engineers continued engineering studies.|$|E
25|$|UAM's Cantoblanco Campus holds {{most of the}} university's facilities. It {{is located}} 15km north of Madrid and has an {{extension}} of over 2,200,000m². Of these are nearly 770,000 urbanised and {{about a third of}} them garden areas. The campus was designed as a university town that was to be self-sufficient, but <b>also</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> away from Madrid in order to keep student activity against the Francoist dictatorship away from the capital.|$|E

25|$|Approximately 2.4billion {{people live}} in the {{drainage}} basin of the Himalayan rivers. India, China, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar could experience floods followed by severe droughts in coming decades. In India alone, the Ganges provides water for drinking and farming for more than 500 million people. The west coast of North America, which gets much of its water from glaciers in mountain ranges such as the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Nevada, <b>also</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> affected.|$|E
25|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the trial of no. 213, the Board decided to purchase the vehicle. When trams were withdrawn from the remainder of the North Beach tramline in 1934, it was decided that that route <b>also</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> converted to trolley bus operation, for which it was decided to go with an additional four Ransomes trolley buses. Ransomes supplied the chassis and running gear and the bodies were constructed in the Board's own workshops to a slightly different design than that of no. 213.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the {{designer}} tries {{to shape the}} dam so {{if one were to}} consider the part of dam above any particular height to be a whole dam itself, that dam <b>also</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> held in place by gravity. i.e. there is no tension in the upstream face of the dam holding the top of the dam down. The designer does this because it is usually more practical to make a dam of material essentially just piled up than to make the material stick together against vertical tension.|$|E

25|$|Distortion {{corrections}} {{account for}} field nonuniformities of the scanner. One method, as described before, {{is to use}} shimming coils. Another is to recreate a field map of the main field by acquiring two images with differing echo times. If the field were uniform, {{the differences between the}} two images <b>also</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> uniform. Note these are not true preprocessing techniques since they are independent of the study itself. Bias field estimation is a real preprocessing technique using mathematical models of the noise from distortion, such as Markov random fields and expectation maximization algorithms, to correct for distortion.|$|E

25|$|October 1980 saw the acrimonious {{departure}} of Ian Craig Marsh and Martyn Ware {{from the original}} line-up of the Human League at very short notice. It was decided that Philip Oakey would retain the title of The Human League. Oakey <b>also</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> responsible for honouring the band's commitments to Virgin Records. One of these commitments included an imminent European tour, and the promoters threatened to sue Oakey {{if it was not}} completed as scheduled. With a hostile music press writing off The Human League, Oakey hastily set about finding replacement group members for the tour that was due to start in less than a week.|$|E

25|$|Involved with civic affairs {{upon his}} arrival in Edmonton, Bellamy would serve terms on the school board, and {{eventually}} city council, being first elected in 1895. He <b>also</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> elected to council again in 1904, 1907, 1911 and 1916. During his time on council, he was a supporter of municipal ownership. He also worked to change taxation policies to lessen {{the burden on the}} citizens of the city. He would stand as a candidate for mayor on three separate occasions, in 1906, 1908 and 1917, unsuccessful on each occasion. Upon his defeat in his final bid for mayor in 1917, he would retire from the civic politics scene.|$|E
25|$|The Constitutional Conventions of the 1890s, which met {{to draft}} an Australian Constitution, also raised {{the idea of}} a federal Supreme Court. Initial {{proposals}} at a conference in Melbourne in February 1890 led to a convention in Sydney in March and April 1891, which produced a draft constitution. The draft included the creation of a Supreme Court of Australia, which would not only interpret the Constitution, like the United States Supreme Court, but <b>also</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a court of appeal from the state Supreme Courts. The draft effectively removed appeals to the Privy Council, allowing them only if the British monarch gave leave to appeal and not allowing appeals at all in constitutional matters.|$|E
25|$|According to a UN climate report, the Himalayan glaciers {{that are}} the sources of Asia's biggest rivers – Ganges, Indus, Brahmaputra, Yangtze, Mekong, Salween and Yellow – could {{disappear}} by 2035 as temperatures rise. It was later revealed that the source used by the UN climate report actually stated 2350, not 2035. Approximately 2.4 billion people live in the drainage basin of the Himalayan rivers. India, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar could experience floods followed by droughts in coming decades. In India alone, the Ganges provides water for drinking and farming for more than 500 million people.

50|$|Implementing {{this bill}} {{would lead to}} lower {{discretionary}} spending for salaries and expenses for those removed from the SES for misconduct or underperformance. CBO estimates that the spending decrease <b>would</b> <b>be</b> small because so few employees <b>would</b> likely <b>be</b> affected. According to the Office of Personnel Management, only 5 SES employees {{over the past five}} years would have met the criteria for salary adjustments set forth in this bill. Because some affected employees would receive a reduced salary, their retirement contributions <b>would</b> <b>also</b> <b>be</b> slightly reduced, resulting in a reduction in revenues. CBO estimates that those reductions <b>also</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> significant.|$|R
25|$|The {{detailed}} report {{would have the}} line begin at Martinsried (the southwest extension to the current U6 line) and continue to Implerstraße, which would be expanded from three-track to four-track platforms. The existing service tunnel between Implerstrasse and Theresienwiese would be extended to two tracks, and at Theresienwiese the U9 would share platforms with the U4/U5 lines;. The station would be rebuilt from two-track to four-track platforms with wider platforms to reduce overcrowding and speed up passenger movement. From Theresienwiese, a new tunnel would spur toward its own platform underneath Central Station, continue to a new station Pinakotheken, then on to Giselastraße where it would rejoin the U3/U6 line in a station expanded from two-track to four-track platforms. The tunnel between there and Münchner Freiheit <b>also</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> built out from two tracks to four; and from Münchner Freiheit station, the U9 would continue to the current end of the U6, Garching-Forschungszentrum, while the U6 would terminate sooner at Fröttmaning.|$|E
25|$|Queens is the easternmost {{and largest}} in {{area of the}} five boroughs of New York City. It is {{geographically}} adjacent to the borough of Brooklyn at the southwestern end of Long Island, and to Nassau County farther east on Long Island; in addition, Queens shares water borders with the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx. Coterminous with Queens County since 1899, the borough of Queens is the second-largest in population (after Brooklyn), with a census-estimated 2,333,054 residents in 2016, approximately 48% of them foreign-born. Queens County also is the second-most populous county in the U.S. state of New York, behind the neighboring borough of Brooklyn, which is coterminous with Kings County. Queens is the fourth-most densely populated county among New York City's boroughs, {{as well as in}} the United States. If each of New York City's boroughs were an independent city, Queens <b>also</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the nation's fourth most populous, after Los Angeles, Chicago, and Brooklyn. Queens is the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world.|$|E
25|$|While Nehru {{exempted}} Muslim {{law from}} legislation and they remained unreformed, he did pass the Special Marriage Act in 1954. The idea behind this act {{was to give}} everyone in India the ability to marry outside the personal law under a civil marriage. As usual the law applied to all of India, except Jammu and Kashmir (again leading to accusations of selective secularism). In many respects, the act was almost identical to the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955, which gives some idea as to how secularised the law regarding Hindus had become. The Special Marriage Act allowed Muslims to marry under it and thereby retain the protections, generally beneficial to Muslim women, {{that could not be}} found in the personal law. Under the act polygamy was illegal, and inheritance and succession would be governed by the Indian Succession Act, rather than the respective Muslim Personal Law. Divorce <b>also</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> governed by the secular law, and maintenance of a divorced wife would be along the lines set down in the civil law.|$|E

25|$|The {{question}} whether feeding is of practical importance has by now been clearly settled for some Chironomus species, at least; specimens that had fed on sucrose flew {{far longer than}} starved specimens, and starved females longer than starved males, which suggested they had eclosed with larger reserves of energy than the males. Some authors suggest the females and males apply the resources obtained in feeding differently. Males expend the extra energy on flight, while females use their food resources to achieve longer lifespans. The respective strategies should be compatible with maximal probability of successful mating and reproduction in those species that do not mate immediately after eclosion, and in particular in species that {{have more than one}} egg mass maturing, the less developed masses being oviposited after a delay. Such variables <b>also</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> relevant to species that exploit wind for dispersal, laying eggs at intervals. Chironomids that feed on nectar or pollen may well be of importance as pollinators, but current evidence on such points is largely anecdotal. However, the content of protein and other nutrients in pollen, in comparison to nectar, might well contribute to the females' reproductive capacities.|$|E
25|$|The next morning, diplomats {{from the}} besieged legations met {{to discuss the}} Empress's offer. The {{majority}} quickly agreed {{that they could not}} trust the Chinese army. Fearing that they would be killed, they agreed to refuse the Empress's demand. The German Imperial Envoy, Baron Klemens Freiherr von Ketteler, was infuriated with the actions of the Chinese army troops and determined to take his complaints to the royal court. Against the advice of the fellow foreigners, the baron left the legations with a single aide and a team of porters to carry his sedan chair. On his way to the palace, von Ketteler was killed on the streets of Beijing by a Manchu captain. His aide managed to escape the attack and carried word of the baron's death back to the diplomatic compound. At this news, the other diplomats feared they <b>also</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> murdered if they left the legation quarter and they chose to continue to defy the Chinese order to depart Beijing. The legations were hurriedly fortified. Most of the foreign civilians, which included a large number of missionaries and businessmen, took refuge in the British legation, the largest of the diplomatic compounds. Chinese Christians were primarily housed in the adjacent palace (Fu) of Prince Su who was forced to abandon his property by the foreign soldiers.|$|E
500|$|After {{ecological}} objections forced subterranean pipeline crossings (in {{order to}} allow caribou to cross), engineers developed a system by which the ground near the pipeline would be refrigerated by chilled brine. These refrigerated sections <b>also</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> placed in Styrofoam-lined trenches and covered with gravel for their insulation value. Altogether, [...] of the pipeline {{was designed to be}} built underground in this way. In other places, a lack of permafrost meant it could simply be placed underground without a special refrigeration plant. Large amounts of gravel were needed for all sections of the pipeline as insulation to keep the heat of above-ground structures from melting the permafrost. Gravel also was needed to build the construction and maintenance road, and surveyors located 470 sites across Alaska where the needed [...] of gravel could be located.|$|E
