The pressure rises to about 1 MPa (10 bar). During the reaction, oxonium ions are also formed which reduce the pH to pH 5 and lower. This step can be accelerated by adding {{a small amount of}} citric acid. In this case, at low pH values, more carbon passes into the aqueous phase. The effluent reaction is exothermic, that is, energy is released. After 12 hours, the carbon of the reactants is completely reacted, 90 to 99% of the carbon is present as an <b>aqueous</b> <b>sludge</b> of porous brown coal spheres (C 6 H 2 O) with pore sizes between 8 and 20 nm as a solid phase, the remaining 1 to 10% of carbon is either dissolved in the aqueous phase or converted to carbon dioxide.

Currently, there is a large effort in progress to prepare to ship this waste to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad, New Mexico. In order to meet the TRU Waste Characterization Quality Assurance Program Plan nondestructive assay compliance requirements and quality assurance objectives, it is necessary to determine the total uncertainty of the radioassay results produced by the Stored Waste Examination Pilot Plant (SWEPP) Passive Active Neutron (PAN) radioassay system. This paper is {{one of a series of}} reports quantifying the results of the uncertainty analysis of the PAN system measurements for specific waste types and measurement modes. In particular this report covers active mode measurements of weapons grade plutonium-contaminated <b>aqueous</b> <b>sludge</b> waste contained in 208 liter drums (item description codes 1, 2, 7, 800, 803, and 807). Results of the uncertainty analysis for PAN active mode measurements of <b>aqueous</b> <b>sludge</b> indicate that a bias correction multiplier of 1. 55 should be applied to the PAN <b>aqueous</b> <b>sludge</b> measurements. With the bias correction, the uncertainty bounds on the expected bias are 0 {+-} 27 %. These bounds meet the Quality Assurance Program Plan requirements for radioassay systems...|$|E

The centrifugation of mixture at 4000 g for at least 20  min basically separates the mixture into three fractions: the sludge and solid layer at the bottom, the protein hydrolysate solution in the middle and the fish oil layer on the top (He et al. 2013). Cui (1996) reported more detailed fractionation of the mixture on sludge in the bottom, aqueous layer in the middle, lipid–protein fraction between <b>aqueous</b> layer and <b>sludge,</b> <b>aqueous</b> and oil layers and oil layer on the top; visualized picture of these layers {{can be found in the}} paper (Kristinsson and Rasco 2000).|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe authors {{explored}} {{the risks and}} benefits of repeated irrigation of Populus alba saplings with <b>aqueous</b> paper <b>sludge</b> (APS). Saplings were cultivated in pots of forest soil (3 L) in a greenhouse for 7 weeks and watered twice a week with differing concentrations of APS (0, 10, 20, 30, 50, 75,and 100 % v/v with deionized water). Plant growth and ecophysiological variables along with zinc and aluminum transfer were monitored. A stimulation of plant growth was observed with sludge treatments of 30 or 50 %, significantly correlated to APS input (r = 0. 81). This may be explained by the easily available nitrogen as is shown with the positive correlation of CO 2 assimilation and leaf nitrogen (r = 0. 70). However, a significant reduction in plant growth was observed when treatments of 75 and 100 % of APS were administered, despite a high nutritional level (nitrogen and phosphorus). The study suggests that APS concentrations from 30 to 50 % may positively affect the growth of poplar saplings; however, the higher concentrations indicated a risk for plant growth and the environment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Se K-edge XAFS spectra were {{collected}} for various model compounds of Se {{as well as}} for 3 biofilm samples from bioreactors used for Se-contaminated wastewater treatment. In the biofilm samples, Se is dominantly as Se(0) despite Se K-edge XANES spectroscopy cannot easily distinguish between elemental Se and Se(-I) -bearing selenides. EXAFS spectra indicate that Se is located within aperiodic domains, markedly different to these known in monoclinc red selenium. However, Se can well occur within nanodivided domains related to monoclinic red Se, as this form was optically observed at the rim of some <b>sludges.</b> <b>Aqueous</b> selenate is then efficiently bioreduced, under sulfate reducing and methanogenic conditions...|$|R
40|$|Contamination of vadose zone sediments under tank BX- 102 at the Hanford site, Washington, {{resulted}} from the accidental release of 7 - 8 metric tons of uranium dissolved in caustic <b>aqueous</b> <b>sludge</b> in 1951. We have applied synchrotron-based X-ray spectroscopic and diffraction techniques to characterize the speciation of uranium in samples of these contaminated sediments. U LIII-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopic studies demonstrate that uranium occurs predominantly as a uranium- (VI) silicate from the uranophane group of minerals. XAFS cannot distinguish between {{the members of this}} mineral group due to the near identical local coordination environments of uranium in these phases. However, these phases differ crystallographically, and can be distinguished using X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods. As the concentration of uranium was too low for conventional XRD to detect these phases, X-ray microdiffraction (µXRD) was used to collect diffraction patterns on ~ 20 µm diameter areas of localized high uranium concentration found using microscanning X-ray fluorescence (µSXRF). Only sodium boltwoodite, Na(UO 2) (SiO 3 OH) • 1. 5 H 2 O, was observed; no other uranophane group minerals were present. Sodium boltwoodite formation has effectively sequestered uranium in these sediments under the current geochemical and hydrologic conditions. Attempts to remediate the uranium contamination will likely face significant difficulties because of the speciation and distribution of uranium in the sediments...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntensification {{of sewage}} sludge {{processing}} through efficient dehydration has been a pressing issue for a considerable length of time. It is possible to circumvent disadvantages of currently used techniques by vibration-assisted filtering {{of sewage sludge}} during sludge dehydtation. We suggest that exposing sludge and the utilized technological system to vibration may eliminate disadvantages of currently used processing methods. We suppose that vibration applied to a technological system and sludge adjacent to the filter will shorten the dehydration time. A high-frequency vibration {{may be used to}} prevent liquid and solid phases from mixing. Segregation, solid phase thickening and fractionation of <b>sludge</b> <b>aqueous</b> suspension occur during such treatment. The efficiency of the filter's self-cleaning may be increased through the vibro-jet effect. In addition, vibration parameters of the system have to comply with the biharmonic law...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} and fate of four cyclic and two linear volatile siloxanes {{were studied}} in a municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP), Beijing City, China. <b>Aqueous</b> and <b>sludge</b> samples {{were analyzed by}} solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC MS). In the studied WWTP, four cyclic analogs (D 3 -D 6) had significantly higher concentrations and frequencies than the two linear analogs [Octamethyltrisiloxane (L 3) and Decamethyltetrasiloxane (L 4) ], with inputs into the WWTP ranging from 78. 2 to 387. 7 kg/year. Removal efficiencies of volatile cyclic siloxanes in two parallel secondary treatment processes ranged from 59. 3 to 92. 7 %. For volatile cyclic siloxanes, relative fractions of mass loss by adsorption to sludge ranged from 8. 3 to 53. 0 %, and their adsorption capacities were significantly affected by the dissolved organic matter. Besides adsorption, they were eliminated mainly in anaerobic units (44. 4 - 84. 3 %). Through in vitro biodegradation experiments, we concluded that in the anaerobic compartments, Hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane (D 3) and Dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane (D 6) were eliminated mostly by volatilization, while Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D 4) and Decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D 5) may be eliminated by both volatilization and degradation. Furthermore, microbe catalysis hydrolysis was identified {{as one of the}} main degradation pathways for D 4 and D 5 in anaerobic compartments. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{hot water}} process used by Suncor and Synacrude to extract bitumen from the Athabasca Oil Sands {{produces}} {{large volumes of}} tailings slurry. The fine grained sludge component of this waste is the most troublesome because of its stability and poor compaction potential. The sludge apparently owes its stability substantially to a complex interaction between organic coated amorphous particles, clays and bitumen. In this study we have investigated the nature of both the minerals and the associated organic matter present in a thickened, <b>aqueous</b> tailings <b>sludge</b> sample, from the Synacrude Canada Limited plant. An oil phase agglomeration technique {{was used to remove}} free bitumen and associated oil wettable solids from the sludge. On standing, the treated sludge, unlike a comparable blank, separated into settling and non-settling fractions. The solids from these fractions were analyzed by; X-ray diffractometry, Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry, Solid State MAS 22 ̆ 079 Si and 22 ̆ 077 Al NMR spectroscopy in an attempt to characterize the inorganic minerals present. The oil phase solids showed considerable enrichment in heavy metals compared to the other solids. The findings of this study could be helpful in providing some insight into the nature of tailings pond sludge, a problem which poses the most imminent environmental contraint to future use of the "hot water" process.

40|$|The role of {{wastewater}} treatment plant (WWTP) in environmental cycling of the poly- and perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFASs) through the <b>aqueous</b> effluent, <b>sludge</b> and air emission has been critically reviewed here. Understanding the role WWTPs can provide better understanding of global cycling of persistent PFASs and assist in formulating relevant environmental policies. The review suggested that, the WWTP effluent is {{a major source of}} perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) in surface water. Land application of biosolids (treated sludge) have shown preferential bioaccumulation of short chain (<C 7) PFAAs in various plant compartment, leading to possible contamination of the food cycle. Elevated air concentration (1. 5 to 15 times) of ∑PFASs were reported higher on WWTP sites (above aeration tanks), compared to reference sites not contaminated with WWTP emission. The air emission of neutral PFASs has important implication considering the long-range transport and subsequent degradation of the neutral compounds leading to the occurrence of recalcitrant PFAAs in pristine, remote environments. Research gap exist in terms of fate of polyfluroalkyl compounds (neutral PFASs) during wastetwater treatment and in aquatic and terrestrial environemnt. Considering the wide range of commercially available PFASs, measuring only perfluorocarboxylic acid (PFCA) and perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) can lead to underestimation total PFAS load derived from WWTPs. Knowledge of the various pathways of PFAS from WWTP to receiving environment, outlined in this study can help to adopt best possible management practices to reduce the release of PFASs from WWTP...|$|R
40|$|The Environmental Simulation Program is {{a process}} {{simulator}} designed for aqueous based chemical processes. ESP, which is produced by OLI Systems, Inc., utilizes sophisticated activity coefficient models and predictive equations that result {{in the ability to}} simulate very complex electrolyte systems (OLI, 2002). The software comes with databanks of regressed parameters for a large number of aqueous, vapor, and solid species covering most of the elements. ESP has been used extensively at the U. S. Department of Energy Hanford Site to predict nuclear waste slurry vapor-liquid-solid equilibrium. It has and is being used to model leaching and washing of nuclear waste sludges, evaporation of nuclear waste solutions, crystallization of salts, precipitation of plutonium and other metals from waste solutions, and other processing of dilute and concentrated <b>aqueous</b> solutions, <b>sludges,</b> and slurries. The software is also used extensively to rationalize the characterization of nuclear wastes using limited data from analyses of waste samples. The OLI provided databanks suffer from a legacy interaction model that limits the accuracy when neutral solutes are important. Also, the nitrate – nitrite systems typically found in nuclear wastes are not properly parameterized in ESP databases because of the existence of sodium nitrate and nitrite ion pairs. Properties databanks for ESP have been developed at Flour Federal Services that eliminate the legacy model and provide more accurate simulation results than the OLI supplied databases for such concentrated solutions and slurries...|$|R
40|$|This work {{investigated}} {{the removal of}} nickel ions from aqueous solutions and activated sludge by employing ultrafiltration (UF) membranes together with natural aluminosilicate minerals (bentonite, zeolite and vermiculite). The performance of the system was examined with respect to different parameters including the membrane nominal pore size, the temperature and pH of <b>aqueous</b> solution and <b>sludge,</b> the mineral type and concentration, the sludge MLSS concentration, the Ni(II) initial concentration and the metal-mineral contact time. The experiments were conducted in a batch ultrafiltration unit with constant initial Ni(II) concentration of 320 mg/l. The addition of 15 g/l of bentonite and 15 g/l of vermiculite at pH 6 resulted in Ni(II) removal efficiencies of 65. 3 % and 80. 0 % respectively due to sorption induced by minerals and sludge. The addition of 10 g/l vermiculite at pH 8 resulted {{in the production of}} a final effluent with Ni(II) concentration that met the EPA short-term effluent reuse limit of 2. 0 mg/l. The processes involved in the removal of nickel consisted of biosorption onto sludge flocs, adsorption onto the mineral, retention of insoluble metal ions by the UF membranes and chemical precipitation. High temperatures, sludge MLSS concentrations and pH values favoured the nickel removal process. Film diffusion was important at {{the early stages of the}} process, while intraparticle diffusion was dominant at the later stages. The equilibrium isotherms for the minerals followed the Langmuir model, while sludge followed the Freundlich model. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{agricultural}} use of industrial residues and sewage sludge {{in order to}} provide essential nutrients to a plant and soil liming, {{will be one of the}} most promising alternative options of soil fertilization and liming management in a very near future, as far as these applications follow the prevailing technical norms to prevent eventual environmental contamination. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of slag, <b>aqueous</b> lime, sewage <b>sludge</b> and limestone, under surface application, on soil chemical attributes and soybean yield during a 5 -year cultivation period. The experiment was carried out in dystrophic Clayey Rhodic Hapludox in no-till system from 2002 to 2007. The experiment had a 4 x 4 + 1 factorial random block design and 4 replications. The treatments consisted of centrifuged sewage sludge (CS), biodigestor sewage <b>sludge</b> (BS), <b>aqueous</b> lime (AL) and slag (SL) doses of zero (control), 2, 4 and 8 Mg ha- 1 and one additional treatment of dolomitic limestone of 2 Mg ha- 1. All treatments were applied on soil surface in 2002 and reapplied in 2005. CS, AL and SL wastes can be used as alternative materials of limestone in soil liming, presenting effects on pH and base saturation. Superficial application of wastes and limestone on soybean crop increased uptake of N and P in 2003, 2004 and 2005; K in 2003, 2004 and 2006; Ca in all studied years; Zn in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006, where applied the sewage BS. Superficial application of wastes increased soybean yield in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006; however, in 2007, this increase occurred only with the application of CS. Exchangeable heavy metals available in soil were insignificant and that contributed to the bioavailability absence of these toxic elements in soybean plants during all experimental years...|$|R
40|$|The Savannah River Site {{liquid waste}} system {{consists}} of multiple facilities to safely receive and store legacy radioactive waste, treat, and permanently dispose waste. The large underground storage tanks and associated equipment, {{known as the}} 'tank farms', include a complex interconnected transfer system which includes underground transfer pipelines and ancillary equipment to direct the flow of waste. The waste in the tanks is present in three forms: supernatant, sludge, and salt. The supernatant is a multi-component <b>aqueous</b> mixture, while <b>sludge</b> is a gel-like substance which consists of insoluble solids and entrapped supernatant. The waste from these tanks is retrieved and treated as sludge or salt. The high level (radioactive) fraction of the waste is vitrified into a glass waste form, while the low-level waste is immobilized in a cementitious grout waste form called saltstone. Once the waste is retrieved and processed, the tanks are closed via removing {{the bulk of the}} waste, chemical cleaning, heel removal, stabilizing remaining residuals with tailored grout formulations and severing/sealing external penetrations. The comprehensive liquid waste disposition system, currently managed by Savannah River Remediation, consists of 1) safe storage and retrieval of the waste as it is prepared for permanent disposition; (2) definition of the waste processing techniques utilized to separate the high-level waste fraction/low-level waste fraction; (3) disposition of LLW in saltstone; (4) disposition of the HLW in glass; and (5) closure state of the facilities, including tanks. This paper focuses on determining the effectiveness of waste removal campaigns through monitoring the volume of residual solids in the waste tanks. Volume estimates of the residual solids are performed by creating a map of the residual solids on the waste tank bottom using video and still digital images. The map is then used to calculate the volume of solids remaining in the waste tank. The ability to accurately determine a volume {{is a function of the}} quantity and quality of the waste tank images. Currently, mapping is performed remotely with closed circuit video cameras and still photograph cameras due to the hazardous environment. There are two methods that can be used to create a solids volume map. These methods are: liquid transfer mapping / post transfer mapping and final residual solids mapping. The task is performed during a transfer because the liquid level (which is a known value determined by a level measurement device) is used as a landmark to indicate solids accumulation heights. The post transfer method is primarily utilized after the majority of waste has been removed. This method relies on video and still digital images of the waste tank after the liquid transfer is complete to obtain the relative height of solids across a waste tank in relation to known and usable landmarks within the waste tank (cooling coils, column base plates, etc.). In order to accurately monitor solids over time across various cleaning campaigns, and provide a technical basis to support final waste tank closure, a consistent methodology for volume determination has been developed and implemented at SRS...|$|R
