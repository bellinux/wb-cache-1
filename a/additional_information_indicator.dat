To explore the <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> of these <b>indicators,</b> we analyze data on the macro level from the German Federal Statistical Office combined with micro level data from the German SOEP (1991 - 2008).

40|$|Monitoring systems usually used {{to control}} tailings, {{primarily}} pore water pressure gages and observation wells, are not self evidently representative for mechanical considerations. Therefore an effective risk assessment and risk management is necessary to get <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> to determine <b>indicators</b> for critical situations. Several tailings observations showed an alteration in chemical and radiological parameters during rising saturation induced by climatic changes. These parameters are appropriate to stress indices.

40|$|Vital aspects {{in water}} supply, such as quality and {{reliability}} (or vulnerability) {{of the service}} have been overlooked up to date {{in the definition of}} the term 'Access' when used as a sector indicator. As a rule, governments at all levels are ignoring them and no investments are made accordingly. This paper describes the experience of the Spanish NGO Ingeniería Sin Fronteras (Engineering Without Borders) on considering both aspects in a pilot project implemented in Same rural District, Tanzania. Based on the water point mapping methodology, basic water quality tests were included during the campaign and seasonality questions were also processed. The study aims to provide an example of to which extent improved water points do provide safe water; while considering year round functionality as a key aspect if the service wants to be sustainable. New indicators are proposed and results discussed. Last section concludes providing information on the opportunities, costs and challenges of including this <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> when access <b>indicators</b> are to be used.

40|$|Recently, {{building}} on the highly polarizing Stiglitz report, a growing literature suggests that statistical offices and applied researchers explore other aspects of human welfare apart from material well-being, such as job security, crime, health, environmental factors and subjective perceptions. To explore the <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> of these <b>indicators,</b> we analyze data on the macro level from the German Federal Statistical Office combined with micro level data from the German SOEP (1991 - 2008) on the personal work situation and subjective feelings concerning several aspects of life. Employing the indicators suggested by the Stiglitz Report, we find {{that much of the}} variation in many well-being measures can indeed be captured well by the hard economic indicators as used in the literature, especially by GDP and the unemployment rate. This suggests that the hard indicators are still a reasonable and quite robust gauge of well-being of a country. And yet, we also see that these correlations are far from perfect, thus giving considerable hope that there is room for a broader statistical reporting. " (author's abstract...|$|R
40|$|We {{explored}} {{the value of}} ergosterol, phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles and neutral lipid fatty acid (NLFA) 16 : 1  5 c as soil quality indicators for the intensive systems of vegetable production in the humid tropical climate of West Java, by comparing organic and conventional management. Additionally, we measured dehydrogenase and -glucosidase activity. A secondary forest was included to obtain reference values under undisturbed conditions. Organic and conventional agriculture, and secondary forest each differed {{in the composition of}} the microbial community measured by PLFA profiles. Ergosterol appeared not to be universally applicable as a fungal biomarker and in this respect seemed to be inferior compared to PLFA fungal markers. NLFA 16 : 1  5 c may provide <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> as an <b>indicator</b> of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, but its high variability complicated the interpretation of data. The ratio of cy 17 : 0 to 16 : 1  7 c was effectively applied as an indicator of physiological stress experienced by the bacterial community. Conventional vegetable production resulted in higher cy 17 : 0 / 16 : 1  7 c ratios. Finally, a soil quality index, developed by stepwise canonical discriminant analysis and based on the absolute amount of PLFA 16 : 0, the relative amount of PLFAs 10 Me 16 : 0 and 10 Me 18 : 0, and dehydrogenase activity, was successfully validated...|$|R

30|$|To {{reduce the}} high PAPR in OFDM, {{a number of}} {{approaches}} have been proposed. The existing solutions are broadly classified into two categories: receiver-dependent schemes and receiver-independent schemes. Receiver-dependent schemes transmit a PAPR reduction signal including <b>additional</b> <b>information.</b> At the receiver side, the transmitted signal can be decoded using the <b>additional</b> <b>information.</b> Typically, the tone reservation (TR) [3], selective mapping (SLM) [4], and partial transmit sequence (PTS) [5] are receiver-dependent schemes. However, the inclusion of <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> in receiver-dependent schemes will cause {{a reduction in the}} data rate.
