5|$|Brown {{went on to}} {{earn his}} aviator badge in 1971 after {{attending}} Army <b>Aviation</b> School at Fort Rucker, Alabama. After <b>aviation</b> school, he returned to Vietnam as a UH-1 helicopter pilot in the 129th Assault Helicopter Company. He {{would go on to}} become the first member of the <b>aviation</b> branch to attain the rank of four-star general. In June 1978, Brown was assigned to the 158th <b>Aviation</b> Battalion at Fort Campbell, Kentucky flying Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawks. While a member of the 158th <b>Aviation</b> Battalion Brown was a Company Commander. The 158th <b>Aviation</b> Battalion was originally part of the 101st <b>Aviation</b> Group, the air arm of the 101st Airborne Division.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, the 26th <b>Aviation</b> Battalion was {{dissolved}} and the 126th <b>Aviation</b> Regiment {{arose in}} its place. The 126th <b>Aviation</b> Regiment's battalions {{formed the basis}} of the new divisional 26th <b>Aviation</b> Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the modular force {{structure}} reorganization, the 10th <b>Aviation</b> Brigade {{consisted of a}} Headquarters Company, 10th <b>Aviation</b> Brigade; 3rd Squadron, 17th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Battalion, 10th <b>Aviation</b> Regiment (United States) (formerly 2nd Battalion, 25th <b>Aviation</b> Regiment), 2nd Battalion (Assault), 10th <b>Aviation</b> Regiment (formerly 3rd Battalion, 25th <b>Aviation</b> Regiment); 3rd Battalion, 10th <b>Aviation</b> (General Support), and C Company (<b>Aviation</b> Intermediate Maintenance), 10th <b>Aviation</b> Regiment.|$|E

5|$|After Operation Credible Sport {{ended the}} Army {{leadership}} decided the unit {{was needed for}} future contingency operations. Thusly, on October 16, 1981 Task Force 158 became the 160th <b>Aviation</b> Battalion, with Brown a founding member. The choice of the unit's name was accepted by the U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry as a logical progression of the 101st's 158th and 159th Battalions. The 160th <b>Aviation</b> Battalion was later renamed the 160th Special Operations <b>Aviation</b> Group in 1986; {{it was not until}} 1990 when it would take on its current name, 160th Special Operations <b>Aviation</b> Regiment. In October 1983, Brown participated in the invasion of Grenada, during which his unit became the first <b>aviation</b> unit to use night vision goggles in combat. In the late 1980s, Brown led all U.S. forces assigned to Operation Prime Chance, which provided escort security for American-flagged Kuwaiti tankers during the Iran-Iraq War. During Operation Prime Chance Brown's unit became the first <b>aviation</b> unit to engage in combat using night vision devices when they engaged an Iranian-flagged ship, Iran Ajr, that was seen deploying mines in the Persian Gulf.|$|E
5|$|After the transformation, the reorganized brigade {{retained}} the 3–17th Cavalry and 1- and 2–10th <b>Aviation.</b> 3–10th <b>Aviation</b> and C-10th <b>Aviation</b> were inactivated. Also reactivated {{as part of}} the reorganized unit were 6th Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment and the 277th <b>Aviation</b> Support Battalion. During the transition elements of the 10th <b>Aviation</b> continued to be deployed as part of Task Forces part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, with units returning to Fort Drum for reorganization after their tours were complete. Elements of the 10th <b>Aviation</b> Brigade were deployed to Iraq in 2008 as part of continued operations in that country.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{in order}} to enhance MPLA's combat capacity, Romania sent 150 flight {{instructors}} and other <b>aviation</b> personnel, who contributed to the establishment of an Angolan Military <b>Aviation</b> School.|$|E
5|$|<b>Aviation</b> {{units of}} the {{division}} included 2nd Squadron, 4th Cavalry, and 1st Battalion, 24th <b>Aviation</b> Regiment.|$|E
5|$|From 1997, the 166th <b>Aviation</b> Brigade {{has trained}} other <b>aviation</b> units for front-line service. As such, {{it has never}} seen combat, and has thus never earned any {{campaign}} streamers or unit awards. As the only brigade in the First Army responsible for training <b>aviation</b> units, the 166th <b>Aviation</b> Brigade is the principal unit for training Army Reserve and Army National Guard assets preparing to deploy to contingencies around the world, which means it is responsible for 47 percent of all Army <b>Aviation</b> assets.|$|E
5|$|General <b>aviation</b> in the United Kingdom {{has been}} defined as a civil {{aircraft}} operation other than a commercial air transport flight operating to a schedule or military <b>aviation.</b> Although the International Civil <b>Aviation</b> Organization (ICAO) excludes any form of remunerated <b>aviation</b> from its definition, some commercial operations are often included within the scope of general <b>aviation</b> (GA) in the UK. The sector operates business jets, rotorcraft, piston and jet-engined fixed-wing aircraft, gliders of all descriptions, and lighter than air craft. Public transport operations include business (or corporate) <b>aviation</b> and air taxi services, and account for nearly half of the economic contribution made by the sector. Other commercial GA activities are aerial work, such as surveying and air ambulances, and flight training, which {{plays an important role in}} the supply of pilots to the commercial air transport (CAT) industry. Private flying is conducted for personal transport and recreation. It includes a strong vintage aircraft movement, and encompasses a range of air sports, such as racing, aerobatics, and parachuting, at which British teams and individuals have succeeded in international competition.|$|E
5|$|Naval <b>Aviation</b> Monument Park was {{formally}} dedicated on May 6, 2006, by the Hampton Roads Squadron of the Naval <b>Aviation</b> Foundation Association. Planned since 1997 {{in partnership with}} the City of Virginia Beach, the park features heroic-scale statuary and reliefs to tell the history of Naval <b>Aviation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Since early 2014, the Guards <b>Aviation</b> Division Attack <b>Aviation</b> Regiment of the Southern Military District in the Krasnodar region {{received}} 16 advanced Su-25SMs.|$|E
5|$|The Aerospace Education Program {{provides}} <b>aviation</b> related {{education and}} educational activities for members, including formal, graded courses about {{all aspects of}} <b>aviation</b> including flight physics, dynamics, history, and application. Courses covering the space program, and new technologies and advances in <b>aviation</b> and space exploration, are also available. There are several programs for CAP pilots to improve their flying skills and earn Federal <b>Aviation</b> Administration ratings.|$|E

5|$|The law {{governing}} <b>aviation</b> in the UK {{is defined}} by the Civil <b>Aviation</b> Act 1982, which is updated periodically with amendments, the latest being the Civil <b>Aviation</b> Act 2006. The government department responsible for legislating changes in national policy and long term strategy relating to <b>aviation</b> is the Department for Transport (DfT). At the operational level the independently run Civil <b>Aviation</b> Authority (CAA) regulates economic, safety, and consumer protection aspects, as well as airspace policy, although these responsibilities are being increasingly ceded to the European <b>Aviation</b> Safety Agency (EASA). International aspects of air transport are regulated by agreements made within the International Civil <b>Aviation</b> Organisation (ICAO) as established by the Chicago Convention, whilst most new legislation is now made at the European level through the European Civil <b>Aviation</b> Conference (ECAC). As a consequence, other than in airport development, there are few aspects of the air transport industry in which the government can act in isolation.|$|E
5|$|The main {{exhibits}} of the Howard W. Cannon <b>Aviation</b> Museum on Level 2 of Terminal 1, above baggage claim. There {{are additional}} exhibits throughout {{the airport and}} at other airports in the city. Display items chronicle {{the early history of}} <b>aviation</b> in Southern Nevada.

As of January 2011, Croatia complies with International Civil <b>Aviation</b> Organization <b>aviation</b> safety {{standards and the}} Federal <b>Aviation</b> Administration upgraded it to Category 1 rating.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the large}} U.S. air {{carriers}} and commuter airlines, which on average {{have less than}} 20 fatalities annually, each year general <b>aviation</b> fatalities number in the hundreds. Most general <b>aviation</b> accidents involve single-engine, piston-powered airplanes used in recreational <b>aviation.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{extensive}} evaluation, the 166th <b>Aviation</b> Brigade completed {{training for}} the Combat <b>Aviation</b> Brigade (CAB), 34th Infantry Division on 4 August 2008.

5|$|Bergen <b>Aviation</b> was {{established}} in 1984. Fifty percent of Bergen <b>Aviation</b> was owned by the insurance company Vesta, twenty percent was owned by Vestlandreiser, and the rest was owned by various companies based in Bergen. The airline's first contract was with charter tour operator Vestlandsreiser, which was scheduled to begin on 1 May 1986. The contract was secured after Vestlandsreiser on 30 January 1986 had announced that they would terminate their agreement with Swedish airline Transwede, citing the latter's repeated delays and cancellations. The contract consisted of services from Stavanger Airport, Sola; Bergen Airport, Flesland; Haugesund Airport, Karmøy; and Sandefjord Airport, Torp to Palma de Mallorca Airport, Spain and Crete, Greece. To operate the charter routes, Bergen <b>Aviation</b> bought a 99-seat Sud <b>Aviation</b> SE-210 Caravelle from Hispania Líneas Aéreas in January 1986, financed with a loan from Nevi.|$|E

5|$|Harding also {{wished to}} promote <b>aviation,</b> and Hoover again took the lead, {{convening}} a national conference on commercial <b>aviation.</b> The discussions focused on safety matters, inspection of airplanes, and licensing of pilots. Harding again promoted legislation {{but nothing was}} done until 1926, when the Air Commerce Act created the Bureau of Aeronautics within Hoover's Commerce Department.|$|E
5|$|He {{ranks as}} an early pioneer of <b>aviation,</b> having built and flown his own inventions at a time roughly {{contemporaneous}} with the Wright brothers during the heady, pre-World War I era of aeroplane vogue. He was accepted into the exclusive pioneers' club of Early Birds of <b>Aviation</b> soon after its 1928 foundation, and he was formally added to the Kansas <b>Aviation</b> Museum's Hall of Fame in 1997. A single example of Longren's aircraft – the 1914 pusher biplane that he crashed in Abilene – remains on permanent exhibit at the Kansas Museum of History.|$|E
