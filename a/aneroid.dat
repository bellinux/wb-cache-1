5|$|The Meteorological Flight {{first came}} into being on 1 November 1924. Its main {{priority}} was identifying temperature, pressure, humidity and general weather conditions being logged at sea level to 18,000 feet. These flights were named THUM (Temperature/Humidity). Changes in air conditions usually came in the Atlantic in the west. The Meteorological Office (MET) relied on reports from ships in this regard. The need for aircraft for operations was ignored in 1939 owing to lack of aircraft. However, in June 1940, Bomber Command started to become anxious about base landing conditions and the accuracy of general forecasts. In response from strong support, No. 403 Squadron RAF, No. 404 Squadron RAF and No. 405 Squadron RAF were formed for this purpose. The routes requested by the MET usually involved distances of up to 1,000nm. Hudsons were ideal for this operation, but since none were available Bristol Blenheims filled the role. On 1 March 1941 Coastal Command assumed operational control of all the units. They were redesignated No. 1401 to 1406 flights. All were handed over to No. 18 Group RAF. In October 1940, two more flights, 1407 and 1408 were sent to Iceland to begin operations from there. Several types of single engine aircraft were used; Gloster Gladiators, Hawker Hurricanes and Supermarine Spitfires. Operations were conducted mostly up to 15,000 feet in wartime as the <b>aneroid</b> capsule altimeter {{was not able to}} give accurate readings. A Mk. 14B ICAN altimeter was used. The aircraft had to be flown at the height measured for two minutes to allow the readings to settle or stabilise.|$|E

25|$|His {{experiences}} in South America having convinced him of certain serious {{errors in the}} readings of <b>aneroid</b> barometers at high altitudes, he published a work entitled How to Use the <b>Aneroid</b> Barometer and succeeded in introducing important improvements in their construction. He afterwards published two guide books to Zermatt and Chamonix.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{disappearance}} of the ship, the Bombay Presidency formed a committee, Marine Court of Inquiry, to probe the matter. It pointed out that Vaitarna was ill-equipped with safety measures. It did not have enough lifeboats and life jackets on ship. She was overwhelmed by the heavy storm. The <b>aneroids</b> used on board the other steamers of the line of the ships to which Vaitarna belonged were checked and found erroneous. Bombay Presidency and Shipping companies sent steamers to find the shipwreck but was unsuccessful.|$|R
40|$|In a paper read {{before the}} Society in 1907, {{two of us}} gave an account of {{observations}} made with <b>aneroids</b> on Ben Lomond in 1906 and 1907 with the object of determining the difference of height between Legge Peak, the highest summit {{in the northern part}} of the Ben Lomond range, and the trigonometrical station at the southern end of the range. The trigonometrical station is stated on the official maps of Tasmania to have a height of 5010 feet; Cradle Mountain is stated to be 5069 feet, and the Ben Lomond station comes next below it, being thus the second highest of the officially recorded summits...|$|R

Oh! there is much that is really enjoyable in this kind of life; and if the cares of the vessel, management of men, &c., do harass me sometimes, it is very good for me; security from such troubles having been anxiously and selfishly pursued by me at home.|$|R
25|$|How to Use the <b>Aneroid</b> Barometer. London: John Murray, 1881.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aneroid</b> {{barometers}} have {{a mechanical}} adjustment {{that allows the}} equivalent sea level pressure to be read directly and without further adjustment if the instrument is not moved to a different altitude. Setting an <b>aneroid</b> barometer is similar to resetting an analog clock that is not at the correct time. Its dial is rotated so that the current atmospheric pressure from a known accurate and nearby barometer (such as the local weather station) is displayed. No calculation is needed, as the source barometer reading has already been converted to equivalent sea-level pressure, and this is transferred to the barometer being setâ€”regardless of its altitude. Though somewhat rare, a few <b>aneroid</b> barometers intended for monitoring the weather are calibrated to manually adjust for altitude. In this case, knowing either the altitude or the current atmospheric pressure would be sufficient for future accurate readings.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuel mixture}} is {{automatically}} altitude-controlled by the automatic mixture control. It operates by bleeding higher pressure air from chamber B into chamber A as it flows though a tapered needle valve. The needle valve {{is controlled by}} an <b>aneroid</b> bellows that senses barometric pressure, causing a leaning of the mixture as altitude increases.|$|E
25|$|Increases in {{barometric}} pressure increase a pendulum's period slightly {{due to the}} first two effects, by about 0.11 seconds per day per kilopascal (0.37 seconds per day per inch of mercury or 0.015 seconds per day per torr). Researchers using pendulums to measure the acceleration of gravity had to correct the period for the air pressure at the altitude of measurement, computing the equivalent period of a pendulum swinging in vacuum. A pendulum clock was first operated in a constant-pressure tank by Friedrich Tiede in 1865 at the Berlin Observatory, and by 1900 the highest precision clocks were mounted in tanks that were kept at a constant pressure to eliminate changes in atmospheric pressure. Alternatively, in some a small <b>aneroid</b> barometer mechanism attached to the pendulum compensated for this effect.|$|E
500|$|The {{pressure}} altimeter, {{also known}} as the barometric altimeter, is used to determine changes in air pressure that occur as the aircraft's altitude changes. [...] Pressure altimeters must be calibrated prior to flight to register the pressure as an altitude above sea level. [...] The instrument case of the altimeter is airtight and has a vent to the static port. [...] Inside the instrument, there is a sealed <b>aneroid</b> barometer. [...] As pressure in the case decreases, the internal barometer expands, which is mechanically translated into a determination of altitude. [...] The reverse is true when descending from higher to lower altitudes.|$|E
500|$|In 1908, the Workmans {{returned}} to the Karakoram and explored the 38-mile-long (61km) Hispar Glacier in the Hunza Nagar region; they went from Gilgit to Nagir over the Hispar pass (...) and onto the 37-mile-long (60km) Biafo Glacier to Askole. Their total traverse of the glaciers was another record, and Fanny {{became the first woman}} to travel across any Himalayan glacier of this size. They were the first to explore its many side glaciers and the maps created by their Italian porters helped map the region for the first time. They recorded the physiological effects of high altitude, studied glaciers and ice pinnacles, and took meteorological measurements, including altitude data recorded with both <b>aneroid</b> barometers and boiling point thermometers.|$|E
500|$|Since its {{discovery}} by explorers, {{the height}} of Adams has also been under debate. The topographer for the Pacific Railroad Surveys, Lt. Johnson K. Duncan, and George Gibbs, ethnologist and naturalist for the expedition, thought {{it was about the}} same height as St. Helens. Its large, uneven size apparently contributed to the underestimation. The Northwest Boundary Survey listed Adams as having an elevation of [...] while a later US Coast and Geodetic Survey gave it an elevation of [...] The height was more closely determined in 1895 by members of the Mazamas mountaineering club, William A. Gilmore, Professor Edgar McClure, and William Gladstone Steel. Using a boiling point thermometer, mercurial barometer, and an <b>aneroid</b> barometer, they determined the elevation to be [...] respectively. None of these numbers were used on any map because that same year, 1895, the US Geological Survey (USGS), using a triangulation method, also measured {{the height of}} several mountains in the Cascades and they measured Adams as having an elevation of [...] The USGS further refined their measurement sometime in late 1909 or early 1910 to [...] and again in 1970 to [...] for the release of the Mount Adams East 1:24000 quadrangle. The current elevation, , is generated by the new method, NAVD88, for calculating altitudes.|$|E
500|$|Inherent errors {{may fall}} into several categories, each {{affecting}} different instruments. [...] Density errors affect instruments metering airspeed and altitude. [...] This type of error {{is caused by}} variations of pressure and temperature in the atmosphere. [...] A compressibility error can arise because the impact pressure will cause the air to compress in the pitot tube. At standard sea level pressure altitude the calibration equation (see calibrated airspeed) correctly accounts for the compression {{so there is no}} compressibility error at sea level. At higher altitudes the compression is not correctly accounted for and will cause the instrument to read greater than equivalent airspeed. A correction may be obtained from a chart. Compressibility error becomes significant at altitudes above [...] and at airspeeds greater than [...] Hysteresis is an error that is caused by mechanical properties of the <b>aneroid</b> capsules located within the instruments. [...] These capsules, used to determine pressure differences, have physical properties that resist change by retaining a given shape, even though the external forces may have changed. Reversal errors are caused by a false static pressure reading. [...] This false reading may be caused by abnormally large changes in an aircraft's pitch. [...] A large change in pitch will cause a momentary showing of movement in the opposite direction. [...] Reversal errors primarily affect altimeters and vertical speed indicators.|$|E
2500|$|The {{density of}} mercury will change with {{increase}} or decrease in temperature, so a reading must be adjusted for {{the temperature of the}} instrument. For this purpose a mercury thermometer is usually mounted on the instrument. Temperature compensation of an <b>aneroid</b> barometer is accomplished by including a bi-metal element in the mechanical linkages. [...] <b>Aneroid</b> barometers sold for domestic use typically have no compensation under the assumption that they will be used within a controlled room temperature range.|$|E
2500|$|An <b>aneroid</b> {{barometer}} is {{an instrument}} for measuring pressure as a method that does not involve liquid. Invented in 1844 by French scientist Lucien Vidi, the <b>aneroid</b> barometer uses a small, flexible metal box called an <b>aneroid</b> cell (capsule), which is made from an alloy of beryllium and copper. The evacuated capsule (or usually several capsules, stacked to add up their movements) is prevented from collapsing by a strong spring. Small changes in external air pressure cause the cell to expand or contract. [...] This expansion and contraction drives mechanical levers such that the tiny movements of the capsule are amplified and displayed {{on the face of}} the <b>aneroid</b> barometer. [...] Many models include a manually set needle which is used to mark the current measurement so a change can be seen. [...] In addition, the mechanism is made deliberately [...] "stiff" [...] so that tapping the barometer reveals whether the pressure is rising or falling as the pointer moves. This type of barometer is common in homes and in recreational boats, as well as small aircraft. It is also used in meteorology, mostly in barographs and as a pressure instrument in radiosondes.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Aneroid</b> {{barometers}} {{are used}} in scuba diving. A submersible pressure gauge is used {{to keep track of}} the contents of the diver's air tank. Another gauge is used to measure the hydrostatic pressure, usually expressed as a depth of sea water. [...] Either or both gauges may be replaced with electronic variants or a dive computer.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} {{pressure}} {{is central to}} the study of both fluid statics and fluid dynamics. [...] A pressure can be identified for every point in a body of fluid, regardless of whether the fluid is in motion or not. [...] Pressure can be measured using an <b>aneroid,</b> Bourdon tube, mercury column, or various other methods.|$|E
2500|$|Arterial {{pressure}} is most commonly measured via a sphygmomanometer, which historically used {{the height of}} a column of mercury to reflect the circulating pressure. The most common automated blood pressure measurement technique is based on the so-called [...] "oscillometric" [...] method. Blood pressure values are generally reported in millimetres of mercury (mmHg), though <b>aneroid</b> and electronic devices do not contain mercury.|$|E
2500|$|Final Checkout: In the {{non-magnetic}} building, [...] "compass swinging" [...] {{was completed}} by hanging the V-1 and pointing it toward the target. [...] The missile's external casing of 16-gauge sheet steel was beaten with a mallet until its magnetic field was suitably aligned. The automatic pilot was set with the flight altitude input (300â€“2500 metres) to the barometric (<b>aneroid)</b> height control and with the range set within the air log (journey computer).|$|E
2500|$|The Misquah Hills were {{surveyed}} by Newton H. Winchell, Minnesota state geologist, and Ulysses S. Grant II in the 1890s, who, using an <b>aneroid</b> barometer mistakenly gave {{the title of}} highest peak in Minnesota to an unnamed 2230-foot summit near {{what is now called}} Winchell Lake. [...] A United States Department of the Interior survey team remeasured several summits in the Misquahs in 1961, using aerial photographs and benchmarking (geolocating), resulting in the current set of height measurements.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concepts}} of total pressure and dynamic pressure arise from Bernoulli's equation and are {{significant in the}} study of all fluid flows. [...] (These two pressures are not pressures in the usual senseâ€”they cannot be measured using an <b>aneroid,</b> Bourdon tube or mercury column.) [...] To avoid potential ambiguity when referring to pressure in fluid dynamics, many authors use the term static pressure to distinguish it from total pressure and dynamic pressure. [...] Static pressure is identical to pressure and can be identified for every point in a fluid flow field.|$|E
2500|$|The {{impellers}} {{were driven}} by a hydraulically operated two-speed gearbox.

Once the aircraft reached and climbed through a set critical altitude, ( [...] for the Merlin 61 and 70 series) the power would start to drop as the atmospheric pressure (the density of air) dropped. As the critical altitude was passed a pressure-operated <b>aneroid</b> capsule operated the gearbox, which changed speed to Full Supercharger (F.S.) gear, which drove the impellers faster, thus compressing a greater volume of the air-fuel mixture.|$|E

This was then fed to the smaller second-stage impellor which further compressed the mixture. The impellors were driven by a hydraulically operated two-speed gearbox. At low to medium altitudes, the supercharger was in low blower (this referred to the speed at which the impellors were operating). Once the aircraft reached and climbed through the set critical altitude ( [...] for the -3) the power would start to drop as the atmospheric pressure, hence the weight of air dropped. As the critical altitude was passed a pressure-operated <b>aneroid</b> capsule operated the gearbox which changed up to high blower, driving the impellors faster, compressing a greater volume of the air-fuel mixture.

2500|$|He {{entered the}} 1910 Gordon Bennett International Balloon Race with Augustus Post {{and they left}} {{the grounds of the}} Aero Club of St. Louis at 5:45p.m. on Monday, October 17, 1910, in their balloon America II. The balloon had been {{specially}} constructed in France for this race and was owned by Major James C. McCoy. During the flight they took watches of three hours each, [...] "one sleeping and one watching the statiscopes, <b>aneroid,</b> and other instruments" [...] (sic). A recording barograph (altimeter) kept a precise log of their altitude during the flight. They reached altitudes of 5,000 meters (16400ft) above the altitude of St. Louis, their 0 altitude reference point. St. Louis is at 140 meters (465ft) above sea level. 46 hours later, at 3:45p.m. on Wednesday, 19 October they landed {{in the middle of the}} wilderness in Quebec, Canada, about [...] north of Chicoutimi. They had been forced to land because of a storm. They were on a hillside at some [...] altitude and had traveled 1887.6 kilometers (1,173mi) from St. Louis. They had traveled at an average of 50 kilometres per hour (30 miles per hour). The next day they traveled south towards the last inhabited area they had passed over. Hawley was slowed by an ankle twisted just after landing. For the next three days they walked, sleeping under their blankets at night and eating a bare minimum of food. They eventually came upon a trapper's hut, at the edge of Lake St. John, which was not occupied at that moment. They rested there for a day, after which two French Canadian men out on a hunting trip arrived and agreed to help them. The trappers took them to Saint-Ambroise-de-Kildare, Quebec. Once there, they sent telegrams to family and the Aero Club to let them know they were alright. The message Hawley sent to his brother read: [...] "Landed in wilderness week ago, fifty miles north of Chicoutimi. Both well â€”Alan." [...] Their telegrams ended searches which had various parties had started, looking for them around the Great Lakes. Clifford B. Harman, a wealthy amateur aeronaut and aviator, had offered $1,000 to anyone who found Hawley and Post, dead or alive. On the evening before their telegrams were sent, Harmon had increased the reward to $7,000.|$|E
