40|$|Thesis (M. Ed. (Student Welfare)) [...] University of Melbourne, Dept. of Education, 2003 In 2000 the {{researcher}} in this current study facilitated {{a working group}} that revised and redeveloped the existing <b>anti-harassment</b> <b>policy</b> at her school. Surveys conducted across the school community at the time indicated that bullying was prevalent at the school, fixing it firmly on the school's educational agenda. Two years later, {{the researcher}} was interested in exploring if and how this redeveloped policy had impacted on students who had previously experienced bullying in the school. The study focuses on six students' stories about their experiences of harassment prior to and after {{the implementation of the}} revised <b>anti-harassment</b> <b>policy.</b> A qualitative research methodology was chosen for this study given that the researcher was interested in exploring personal experience. In order to uncover the in-depth reflections sought, semi-structured interviews were chosen as the primary source of data collection. Each student was interviewed twice over a period of three months. A theme that emerged from the study was that although most of the participants are still experiencing harassment, their experiences of harassment have changed in terms of the frequency of the harassment, the intensity of the harassment and the number of students perpetrating the harassment. In describing their current experiences of harassment, the participants spoke more positively about school and their ability to take action. Questions were raised in this study about the wisdom of commonly used strategies for dealing with harassment such as ignoring the harassment and asking a perpetrator to stop, strategies which the participants found to be unsuccessful. Can students be taught specific skills to implement these strategies successfully? Do these strategies actually stop harassment? Is the promotion of such strategies inconsistent with a view that combating bullying is the school community's responsibility not the individual's? An area perceived as important by the participants was the role of teachers in supporting students and resolving bullying incidents. The participants' stories indicate great variation in how staff perceive their role in dealing with harassment, and how staff interpret and enact the policy. The participants reported that counsellors and other staff members in positions of responsibility are proactive but that some other staff displayed poor attitudes, did not take verbal harassment seriously and treated it as a joke. The study also highlighted that the <b>anti-harassment</b> <b>policy</b> cannot necessarily change the culture of the school on its own and that the school needs to approach harassment on a variety of levels including the professional development of all staff, the skilling of victims with a focus on improving self-esteem and empowering them to tell someone about harassment, and the inclusion of curriculum-based resources which all students can access. Constantly promoting the policy, making it more accessible and displaying it in more prominent places was also thought to be important. As well as indicating issues that require further attention, these insights shape the direction for the future refinement and development of the school's approach to bullying.

Despite school {{employment}} and <b>anti-harassment</b> <b>policies</b> which specifically announce, in accordance with the Human Rights Act (1993), that all members of our diverse society are equally welcome, the reality often falls short of this. Schools vary widely, both in their choice of staff, and in their support for employees who may identify as (or are perceived to be) LGBTI. Some schools are pro-active and welcome diversity of all kinds, seeing this as a strength in that it reflects their community and provides role models for students who may be struggling with their own identities. Other schools are less welcoming: non-heterosexual staff employed in these institutions may find that they are disregarded, not supported in times of conflict (whether with other staff, or with students and their families), may be blocked from opportunities for promotion, and even become the target for harassment. This study briefly examines the situation in a small cross-section of New Zealand schools and assesses {{the degree to which a}} safe environment for queer teachers is provided.
