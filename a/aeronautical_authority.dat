This norm has demanded additional investments from airlines, especially on technology and aircraft renewal.

The old airport building, which currently is {{being used as a}} cargo terminal, was built on an area of 720 ha and was 126 ft above sea level. As time passed, and due to Panama's role as a country of transit, that terminal became too small to attend to the growing demand for air operations.

The bad meteorological conditions on the day (which included clouds, moderate to heavy winds, with turbulence) and the lack of autonomous navigational aids aboard the aircraft (such as GPS), that could have determined their position, were also factors that contributed to the accident.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the last}} decade, the <b>{{aeronautical}}</b> <b>authorities</b> ex- pressed {{their need to}} develop a new system for aeronautical radio- communications. The L-band Digital Aeronautical Communica- tion System (L-DACS) is the part of the future system that will be operating {{in a part of the}} aeronautical L-band (960 − 1164 MHz), already occupied by a large number of radio-frequency legacy systems. This paper aims at studying the L-DACS impact on a legacy system, the Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), under two critical situations. Such topics are fundamental in aeronau- tics, as any communication or radionavigation dysfunction may endanger flight and passengers security. Some obtained results will be used for the L-DACS standardization and its specifications finalization. For the first scenario (air-to-air scenario), we propose a deterministic algorithm to compute the interference level in the frequency domain.

40|$|Brazil built {{one of the}} world’s largest {{aeronautical}} infrastructures. The airport net {{is distributed}} along its vast territory, which shows a tremendous ecosystem variety. Having a large civilian aircraft fleet and also running second after Venezuela in catalogued bird species, Brazil has had problems related to bird strikes. Nevertheless, Brazil {{is made up of}} 26 States plus the Federal District. Thus, besides the Union Government, each state holds its own government structure. The states are divided into counties that also have their own administrative structure. The jurisdiction of each level of government is established by the Federal Constitution, laws and others legal acts. Therefore, solutions for bird strike hazards, whose root causes are spread into all three government levels, encompass many institutions and require an orchestrated co-ordination. The paper comments on aspects of the lead role played by CENIPA, the main organization of the Brazilian flight safety system, to keep the avian hazard under control in Brazil.

50|$|Initially, two Middle Eastern {{terrorist}} groups {{claimed responsibility for}} the crash. An anonymous letter signed by those groups claimed that a suicide mission had sabotaged the plane in retaliation against the United States. However, sabotage was later dismissed as a cause of the crash. The investigations were carried out by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Mexican <b>aeronautical</b> <b>authorities,</b> who found that the cause of the accident was that the center landing gear tire was filled with compressed air, instead of nitrogen. In addition, the tire had some marks of overheating. The investigators later found that the overheating was caused by a malfunctioning brake on the landing gear.Mexicana maintenance personnel were blamed for negligence in maintaining the 727 and for filling the tire with compressed air, instead of nitrogen. The crash remains the deadliest airline disaster in Mexican history and is the world's worst air disaster involving the Boeing 727. The cause of the in-flight fire {{is believed to be the}} rupture of fuel lines by the exploding tire.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe closer {{proximity}} between {{airports and}} residential areas {{has created a}} growing attention regarding noise pollution. The noise abatement procedures established by the <b>aeronautical</b> <b>authorities</b> and the models for computing noise contours around airports are proof of that. There are also models for identifying aircraft taking off which {{have focused on the}} correlation between the aircraft position and the noise signal. However, this correlation has been made so far without spatial information. The present study proposes a method to estimate the geo-referenced flight path followed by an aircraft taking off, using the spatio-temporal information extracted from the noise signal and improved with a smoothing algorithm. A microphone array with twelve sensors is used in order to evaluate different sensor spacings and the spatial aliasing effect when working with take-off noise signals. The flight path estimation method assumes that the aircraft is following a ground track collinear to the runway and was compared against radar information and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. The average method accuracy was between 3 and 6 meters. The estimated flight path has a ground length of about two kilometers, including locations at least one kilometer apart from the measurement point...|$|R

Safety in aviation demands updated and precise aeronautical charts production, adopting {{the standards of the}} International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). In this paper the methodology employed to generate obstruction charts for five airports in Mexico, using aerial digital imagery obtained with small–format cameras, is described. Through two aerial surveys on each airport, from 10 000 and 5 000 feet above ground level, two orthomosaics were generated covering the airport influence area, the runway, and the obstacle limitation surfaces: approach/Take–off climb, transitional, inner horizontal, and conical. Using stereopair photointerpretation most of the obstacles were identified, and by means of the orthomosaics; aerodrome charts, and aerodrome obstruction charts types A, B and C, were generated. Using satellite geodetic receivers, 18 points were surveyed on each runway in order to obtain its dimensions, and to establish ground control points for mosaics generation.

40|$|Environmental and {{economic}} concerns have pushed <b>aeronautical</b> <b>authorities</b> to set stringent environmental regulations on fuel consumption, noise production, and pollutant emission. Engine manufacturers are developing novel staged injection concepts {{to ensure their}} respect. The injection staging creates a fuel-air mixture stratification involving new combustion processes not fully understood. This paper presents the experimental investigation of NO production for known swirled and / or stratified lean premixed flames. The fuel staging parameter defined as the stratification ratio is studied for values of 1, 2, and 3, while the swirl fractions are 0, 25 and 33 %, changing the flowfield from non-swirling cond itions to high swirl numbers (up to 0. 55). The implementation of simultaneous OH- and NOPLIF imaging techniques is achieved using high energy pulsed laser systems, able, for instance, to deliver 30 mJ/ pulse around the 226 -nm UV wavelength for NO excitation. OH-PLIF is used to characterize the flame structure through the commonly extracted curvature, and also through the measurement of the flame thickness. These results show to be more accurate than thickness obtained from temperature profiles measured by Raman/ Rayleigh laser diagnostics. NO-PLIF is used to quantify the pollutant concentration. To this end, preliminary work was done to select the Q 1 (29. 5) transition as it the least temperature dependent excitation scheme with high fluorescence levels. After realizing a specific calibration of the NO-PLIF technique, the stud ied flames presented concentrations ranging from traces (20 ppm) to high levels (230 ppm). Further analysis of these results reveals that for high stratification ratios the prompt NO is favored and {{is responsible for the}} elevated level of NO pollutant...|$|R
