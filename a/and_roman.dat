40|$|Responding {{to studies}} on {{prejudice}} in the Greco-Roman world, E. Gruen argues that Greeks <b>and</b> <b>Romans</b> had more nuanced and complex opinions about foreigners than often recognized. G. observes that the Greek <b>and</b> <b>Romans</b> could discover or invent links with these other societies through cultural appropriations of the past. These connections, G. contends, {{show that the}} Greeks <b>and</b> <b>Romans</b> cannot be ‘blanketed’ with xenophobia, ethnocentrism, and “let alone racism” (p. 3). G. argues that the Greeks <b>and</b> <b>Romans</b> {{were more interested in}} drawing connections with the other through cultural appropriation. G. contends that this approach reveals a positive outlook which does not reject or degrade the foreign other. Rezension zu: Erich S. Gruen, Rethinking the Other in Antiquity (Princeton 2011). ...|$|R
