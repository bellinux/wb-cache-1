5|$|After scoring touchdowns, Payton {{declined}} to celebrate; instead, he would often hand {{the ball to}} his teammates or the official. He disapproved of the growing practice of touchdown celebrations; he preferred post-game antics such as rushing {{into the locker room}} and locking his teammates out in the cold while taking a long shower. Although Payton would have won the respect of his peers and coaches by his running alone, he retired as the career leader in receptions for <b>a</b> <b>running</b> back with 492 for over 4,500 yards, and still holds the career record for <b>a</b> <b>running</b> back with 8 touchdown passes.|$|E

The Crimson Tide averaged 22.9 points per game, 116 rushing yards per game, and 221.4 passing yards per game.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{graduation}} from the University of Michigan, Wheatley {{was selected by}} the New York Giants of the NFL {{in the first round}} of the 1995 NFL Draft. As <b>a</b> <b>running</b> back for the Giants, he was the team's all-purpose yards leader in 1996 and their leading ballcarrier in 1997. Despite his success on the field, he developed a reputation for indolence. He was traded to the Miami Dolphins, but cut before the 1999 season began. He signed with the Oakland Raiders and flourished, leading the team in rushing three times and twice finishing among the NFL's top ten players in rushing touchdowns.

5|$|In {{the main}} event and final {{scheduled}} match on the card, Bret Hart defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Yokozuna. Hart tried to use his technical wrestling abilities against Yokozuna, while Yokozuna relied on his size advantage in the match. Hart gained control at the beginning, but Yokozuna {{came back with a}} clothesline, leg drop, and nerve hold. Hart regained the advantage when Yokozuna missed <b>a</b> <b>running</b> splash. Yokozuna applied another nerve hold but missed <b>a</b> <b>running</b> splash again. He recovered and carried Hart {{to the middle of the}} ring, but Hart removed the protective padding on the turnbuckle in the corner of the ring. He threw Yokozuna's head into the turnbuckle and applied the Sharpshooter, his signature submission hold that stretches the opponent's legs and back. Mr. Fuji, Yokozuna's manager, threw salt in Hart's eyes, which enabled Yokozuna to pin Hart and win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
