5|$|After the war, {{the three}} {{surviving}} ships were decommissioned and later sold on 12 September 1874. Chickasaws new owners converted her to sidewheel propulsion {{and she became}} a coal and railroad ferry until 1944 when she was scuttled. Her wreck was discovered in 2004.

5|$|Unlike {{her sister}} ship, Active {{was placed in}} reserve after {{completion}} until 1873 when she was commissioned {{to serve as the}} flagship of the Commander-in-Chief, Cape of Good Hope and West Coast of Africa Station, Commodore William Hewett. The ship participated in naval operations during the Third Anglo-Ashanti War of 1874 <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> crew were landed to reinforce the forces ashore. Commodore Francis Sullivan replaced Hewett in 1876 <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> officers and men participated in the Anglo-Zulu War of 1878–79 as part of the Naval Brigade. Sullivan remained in command until 1879 when the ship returned home to refit and rearm. Active was placed in reserve after the completion of her refit until she was selected in 1885 to be the commodore's flagship in the newly formed Training Squadron. The ship was paid off from this assignment in 1898 and sold for scrap in 1906.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War I in August, Active and her flotilla {{were assigned to the}} Grand Fleet. On 1 September, a submarine was spotted inside Scapa Flow and the 2nd DF was detailed to hunt down the imaginary submarine {{while the rest of the}} Grand Fleet put to sea. When not escorting the capital ships of the Grand Fleet, the flotilla spent much time on anti-submarine patrol off the entrances to Scapa Flow. In mid-October, multiple reports of submarines in the Minch caused Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, commander of the Grand Fleet, to send Active <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> destroyers there to hunt them down, but nothing was found. After their search was concluded, they joined a large part of the Grand Fleet at Lough Swilly, Ireland, on 22 October. Sometime between October 1915 and January 1916, the cruiser was relieved of her assignment with the 2nd DF and she was on detached service with the Grand Fleet in January.|$|E
5|$|Aurora was recommissioned {{for service}} in the Far East in 1899 {{under the command of}} Captain Edward Bayly <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> crew, {{including}} Bayly, took part in the Battle of Tientsin in July 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion. In early February 1902 she was ordered to leave, homebound, arriving at Aden on 3 March, at Malta 17 March, and at Plymouth on 26 March. Officers and crew received the China War Medal (1900) on 15 April, before she paid off at Devonport two days later. Aurora was refitted in Clydebank upon her return and was placed in Devonport Reserve in 1904 before she was taken out of service the following year. The ship was sold for scrap to Payton, of Milford Haven, Wales, on 2 October 1907 for £12,700.|$|E
5|$|HMS Active {{was laid}} down in 1867 and {{launched}} on 13 March 1869. The ship was completed in March 1871 at a total cost of £126,156. Of this, £85,795 was spent on her hull and £40,361 on her machinery. Unlike her sister ship , Active was placed in reserve after completion until 1873 when she was commissioned {{to serve as the}} flagship of the Commander-in-Chief, Cape of Good Hope and West Coast of Africa Station, Commodore William Hewett. The ship participated in naval operations during the Third Anglo-Ashanti War of 1874 <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> crew were landed to reinforce the forces ashore.

5|$|Implacables {{construction}} was suspended in 1940 {{in favour of}} escorts needed in the Battle of the Atlantic so that the two carriers were launched within days of each other. She embarked portions of her air wing for training in late August and {{was assigned to the}} Home Fleet on 7 October at Scapa Flow after working up. She joined ships searching for Tirpitz a week later <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> Fairey Fireflies spotted the battleship off Håkøya Island near Tromsø. Subsequently, her Fireflies successfully attacked targets in Norway. In late October, the carrier's Seafires arrived and she participated in Operation Athletic off the Norwegian coast, sinking four warships and two merchant ships and damaging a German submarine. In November and December, Implacable provided air cover for minelaying operations and attacked German shipping off the Norwegian coast. On 15 December she began a refit at Rosyth preparatory to her transfer to the BPF, which included augmenting her light AA armament.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, Stone was {{convinced}} {{to sit for}} a portrait in sculpture, rendered by Anne Whitney, sculptor and poet. Stone had previously protested the proposed portrait {{for more than a}} year, saying that the funds to engage an artist would be better spent on suffrage work. Stone finally yielded to pressure from Frances Willard, the New England Women's Club <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> friends and neighbors in the Boston area, and sat while Whitney produced a bust. In February 1893, Stone invited her brother Frank and his wife Sarah to come see the bust, before it was shipped to Chicago for display at the upcoming World's Columbian Exposition.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Fredrik Reinfeldt {{was born}} in Allmänna BB {{hospital}} in Stockholm and was the oldest of three brothers to his parents Bruno (1938-2016) and Birgitta Reinfeldt. At {{the time of his}} birth his parents lived in an apartment in Österhaninge, in the south of Stockholm County, but a short time afterwards the family moved to London, where his father worked as a consultant for Shell. Upon returning to Sweden, the family first lived in an apartment in Handen before moving to a terraced house in Bromsten in northwestern Stockholm. The Reinfeldt family was living in Bromsten when Fredrik's younger brothers, Magnus and Henrik, were born in 1969 and 1973. In 1976 the family moved into a single-family home in Täby in northeastern Stockholm County. His mother Birgitta was a leadership and management consultant, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> professional skills might have inspired and impressed the young Fredrik.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days of World War II, Provence {{conducted}} patrols and sweeps into the Atlantic to search for German surface raiders. She was stationed in Mers-el-Kébir when France surrendered on 22 June 1940. Fearful that the Germans would seize the French Navy, the British Royal Navy attacked the ships at Mers-el-Kébir. Provence was damaged and sank in the harbor, though she was refloated and moved to Toulon, where she became the flagship of the training fleet there. In late November 1942, the Germans occupied Toulon and, to prevent them from seizing the fleet, the French scuttled their ships, including Provence. She was raised in July 1943, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> guns were used for coastal defense in the area; the Germans scuttled her a second time in Toulon as a blockship in 1944. Provence was ultimately raised in April 1949 and sold to ship breakers.|$|E
5|$|Some of Bellerophons timber {{was bought}} at auction by George Bellamy, {{who had been}} Bellerophons surgeon at the Nile. Bellamy {{incorporated}} them into a cottage he was building at Plymstock. Captain Maitland bought part of her figurehead <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> stern ornaments, later depositing them in the collections of what eventually became the Royal Naval Museum. The National Maritime Museum holds several relics relating to Bellerophon and the people connected with her, including Captain John Cooke's dirk, sword and pistol, and a trophy presented to Admiral Pasley by Lloyd's of London. Their collections also contain artefacts relating to her connection with Napoleon, including the couch from Maitland's cabin, and the skull of a goat which supplied milk for Napoleon and his suite.|$|E
5|$|The Dhumavati Tantra {{describes}} {{her as an}} old and ugly widow. She is thin, tall, unhealthy, and has a pale complexion. She is described as restless and wicked. Unadorned with jewellery, she wears old, dirty clothes and has dishevelled hair. Her eyes are fearsome, her nose long and crooked, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> long fang-like teeth have fallen out, leaving her smile with gaps. Her ears are ugly and rough; her breasts hang down. In one of her trembling hands, she holds a winnowing basket, while the other makes a boon-conferring gesture (varada-mudra) or knowledge-giving gesture (cinmudra). She rides in a horseless chariot bearing an emblem of a crow and a banner. She is astute and crafty, though. Always hungry and thirsty, Dhumavati initiates quarrels and invokes fear.|$|E

5|$|The {{design and}} {{personality}} traits {{of the character}} Rei Ayanami were reused for many anime characters of the late 1990s, such as Ruri Hoshino of Nadesico, Ruriko Tsukushima (The Droplet), Miharu (Gasaraki), Anthy Himemiya (Revolutionary Girl Utena), and Lain Iwakura (Serial Experiments Lain). The character of Asuka was parodied by Excel (Excel Saga), <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> traits were used to create the character of Mai in Gunparade March. According to Italian critic Guido Tavassi, Evangelions mecha design, characterized by a greater resemblance to the human figure, and the abstract designs of the Angels, also {{had a significant impact}} on the designs of future anime productions.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the film were derived from Reiner's return to single life after a divorce. An {{interview}} Ephron conducted with Reiner {{provided the basis for}} Harry.

Ephron supplied the structure of the film with much of the dialogue based on the real-life friendship between Reiner and Crystal. The soundtrack consists of standards performed by Harry Connick Jr., with a big band and orchestra arranged by Marc Shaiman. Connick won his first Grammy Award for Best Jazz Male Vocal Performance.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1918 Holst {{had asked}} Joseph to provide a {{libretto}} for his opera The Perfect Fool, feeling that she might possess the required light touch that he thought his own writing lacked. It {{is not clear whether}} she declined, or whether Holst changed his mind, but he eventually wrote the text himself. Joseph did, however, write the story for a ballet based on Holst's music The Sneezing Charm; the ballet, entitled A Magic Hour, was performed at Morley in October 1920. Meantime, Joseph's works were being performed at SWM concerts: two songs, probably from her Mirage cycle, in January 1920, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> settings of Walter de la Mare poems in December.|$|E

5|$|In 1958, Nathaniel Branden {{established}} Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later incorporated as the Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI), {{to promote}} Rand's philosophy. Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for Objectivist periodicals that she edited. Rand later published {{some of these}} articles in book form. Critics, including some former NBI students and Branden himself, have described the culture of NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand, with some describing NBI or the Objectivist movement itself as a cult or religion. Rand expressed opinions {{on a wide range}} of topics, from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> followers mimicked her preferences, wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers. However, some former NBI students believe the extent of these behaviors has been exaggerated, with the problem being concentrated among Rand's closest followers in New York. Rand was unimpressed with many of the NBI students and held them to strict standards, sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her.|$|E

5|$|Nagato {{was again}} placed in reserve on 1 December 1931 and her {{anti-aircraft}} armament was upgraded the following year. In August 1933 the ship participated in fleet maneuvers {{north of the}} Marshall Islands and she began her first modernization on 1 April 1934. This was completed on 31 January 1936 and Nagato {{was assigned to the}} 1st Battleship Division of the 1st Fleet. During the attempted coup d'état on 26 February by disgruntled Army officers, the ship was deployed in Tokyo Bay <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> sailors were landed in support of the government. In August, she transported 1,749 men of the 43rd Infantry Regiment of the 11th Infantry Division from Shikoku to Shanghai during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Her floatplanes bombed targets in Shanghai on 24 August before she returned to Sasebo the following day. Nagato became a training ship on 1 December until she again became the flagship of the Combined Fleet on 15 December 1938. The ship participated in an Imperial Fleet Review on 11 October 1940.
