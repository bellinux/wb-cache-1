60|$|Arsenic poisoning.... Emily {{had died}} of arsenic poisoning? After that, Mr. Hutton learned with {{surprise}} that there was enough <b>arsenicated</b> insecticide in his green-houses to poison an army.|$|E
6000|$|That {{interesting}} anthropoid's career {{after death}} was one series of misfortunes, ending with being stuffed for the British Museum. My factotum sat {{up half the}} night skinning, {{but it was his}} first coup d'essai. In a climate like the Gaboon, especially during the rains, we should have turned the pelt [...] "hairy side in," [...] filled it with cotton to prevent shrinking, and, after painting on arsenic, have exposed it to the sun: better still, we should have placed it on a scaffolding, like a defunct Congo-man, over a slow and smoky fire, and thus the fatty matter which abounds in the integuments would have been removed. The phalanges of the hands and feet, after being clean-scraped, were restored to their places, and wrapped with thin layers of <b>arsenicated</b> cotton, as is done to small animals, yet on the seventh day decomposition set in; it was found necessary to unsew the skin, and again to turn it inside out. The bones ought to have been removed, and not replaced till the coat was thoroughly dry. The skinned spoils were placed upon an ant-hill; a practice which recalls to mind the skeleton deer prepared by the emmets of the Hartz Forest, which taught Oken that the skull is(?) expanded vertebr√¶. We did not know that half-starved dogs and [...] "drivers" [...] will not respect even arsenical soap. The consequence of exposing the skeleton upon an ant-hill, where it ought to have been neatly cleaned during a night, was that the [...] "Pariah" [...] curs carried off sundry ribs, and the [...] "parva magni formica laboris" [...] took the trouble to devour the skin of a foot. Worse still: the skull, the brain, and the delicate members had been headed up in a breaker of trade rum, which was not changed till the seventh day. It was directed to an eminent member of the old Anthropological Society, and the most interesting parts arrived, I believe, soft, pulpy, and utterly useless. The subject seems to have been too sore for mentioning --at least, I never heard of it again.|$|E
40|$|Motivated by {{a recent}} {{experiment}} that reported the synthesis of a new 2 D material nitrogenated holey graphene (C 2 N) [Mahmood et al., Nat. Commun., 2015, 6, 6486], the electronic, magnetic, and mechanical properties of nitrogenated (C 2 N), phosphorated (C 2 P) and <b>arsenicated</b> (C 2 As) monolayer holey graphene structures are investigated using first-principles calculations. Our total energy calculations indicate that, similar to the C 2 N monolayer, {{the formation of the}} other two holey structures are also energetically feasible. Calculated cohesive energies for each monolayer show a decreasing trend going from the C 2 N to C 2 As structure. Remarkably, all the holey monolayers considered are direct band gap semiconductors. Regarding the mechanical properties (in-plane stiffness and Poisson ratio), we find that C 2 N has the highest in-plane stiffness and the largest Poisson ratio among the three monolayers. In addition, our calculations reveal that for the C 2 N, C 2 P and C 2 As monolayers, creation of N and P defects changes the semiconducting behavior to a metallic ground state while the inclusion of double H impurities in all holey structures results in magnetic ground states. As an alternative to the experimentally synthesized C 2 N, C 2 P and C 2 As are mechanically stable and flexible semiconductors which are important for potential applications in optoelectronics.
