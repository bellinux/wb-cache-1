5|$|After Parry's death, the Welsh Congregational Church {{sought to}} {{purchase}} the copyrights of all Parry's works and to publish them. The church was successful in obtaining the copyright to Aberystwyth and more than 60 other hymns and anthems written by Parry. In 1916, Parry's widow, Jane, sold the rights to <b>all</b> <b>works</b> which Parry owned the copyrights of to Snell and Sons, music publishers, for £1150.|$|E

5|$|In 1956, Johnson's life's {{work was}} almost {{destroyed}} when his caretaker declared him {{unable to pay}} further storage fees. Instead, Helen Harriton, Mary Beattie Brady, and others arranged with the court to have Johnson's belongings delivered to the Harmon Foundation with unconditional rights over <b>all</b> <b>works.</b> The foundation would use the works to advance interracial understanding and support African American achievements in the fine arts. On April 19, 1967, the Harmon Foundation gave more than 1,000 paintings, watercolors, and prints by Johnson to the Smithsonian American Art Museum.|$|E
5|$|When {{the company}} was formed, its policy was to perform <b>all</b> <b>works</b> in English, but since the late 1950s most operas have been {{performed}} in their original language. From the outset, performers have comprised a mixture of British and Commonwealth singers and international guest stars, but fostering the careers of singers from within {{the company was}} a consistent policy of the early years. Among the many guest performers have been Maria Callas, Plácido Domingo, Kirsten Flagstad, Hans Hotter, Birgit Nilsson, Luciano Pavarotti and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. Among those who have risen to international prominence {{from the ranks of}} the company are Geraint Evans, Joan Sutherland, Kiri Te Kanawa and Jon Vickers.|$|E
5|$|When Millennium Park {{first opened}} in 2004, Metra police stopped a Columbia College Chicago journalism student {{working on a}} {{photography}} project, and confiscated his film because of fears of terrorism. In 2005, Cloud Gate attracted some controversy when a professional photographer without a paid permit was denied access to the piece. As {{is the case for}} <b>all</b> <b>works</b> of art currently covered by United States copyright law, the artist holds the copyright for the sculpture. The public may freely photograph Cloud Gate, but permission from Kapoor or the City of Chicago (which has licensed the art) is required for any commercial reproductions of the photographs. Initially the city charged photographers permit fees of $350 per day for professional still photographers, $1,200 per day for professional videographers and $50 per hour for wedding photographers. The policy has been changed so permits are only required for large-scale film, video and photography requiring 10-person crews.|$|E

25|$|<b>All</b> <b>works</b> copyrighted in Russia in 1995, when Russia {{joined the}} Berne Convention, became copyrighted in other Berne countries. By {{virtue of the}} {{retroactivity}} of the Russian copyright law of 1993, this also included many pre-1973 Soviet works, namely <b>all</b> <b>works</b> published in 1945 or later and also older works of authors who died or were rehabilitated in 1945 or later (or 1941 for authors who lived during the Great Patriotic War), if these works were first published in the Russian SFSR (or later in Russia) or the author had become {{a citizen of the}} Russian Federation after the demise of the Soviet Union.|$|E

25|$|<b>All</b> <b>works</b> copyrighted in Russia on January 1, 1996, the {{effective}} {{date of the}} U.S. Uruguay Round Agreements Act, became copyrighted in the U.S. on that date. This essentially concerned all the same works as above, but using the years 1946 or 1942 instead of 1945 and 1941, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concept of}} inventory, stock or {{work-in-process}} {{has been extended}} from manufacturing systems to service businesses and projects, by generalizing the definition to be [...] "all work within the process of production- <b>all</b> <b>work</b> that is or has occurred prior to the completion of production." [...] In {{the context of a}} manufacturing production system, inventory refers to <b>all</b> <b>work</b> that has occurred - raw materials, partially finished products, finished products prior to sale and departure from the manufacturing system. In the context of services, inventory refers to <b>all</b> <b>work</b> done prior to sale, including partially process information.|$|R

25|$|The {{commission}} {{was left with}} supervision of the customs duties, but all its decision were subject to a veto by Romania. The government took over <b>all</b> <b>works</b> and buildings, the Seaman's Hospital, and {{the first floor of}} the administration building. The commission remained in existence; loans advanced to it had not been repaid.|$|E
25|$|Construction of {{this stage}} {{will begin at}} the {{conclusion}} of the Rod Laver Arena redevelopment (see above), likely in 2019. Overall, more than $950 million is being spent on the multi-year redevelopment of the Melbourne Park precinct and completion of <b>all</b> <b>works</b> at the precinct is not expected to finish until around 2020-22.|$|E
25|$|Google {{licensing}} {{of public}} domain works {{is also an}} area of concern due to using of digital watermarking techniques with the books. Some published works {{that are in the}} public domain, such as <b>all</b> <b>works</b> created by the U.S. Federal government, are still treated like other works under copyright, and therefore locked after 1922.|$|E

25|$|The Library has {{a budget}} of between $6–8 million each year for digitization, meaning that not <b>all</b> <b>works</b> can be digitized. It makes {{determinations}} about what objects to prioritize based on what is especially important to Congress or potentially interesting for the public. The 15 million digitized items represent less than 10% of the Library's total 160-million item collection.|$|E
25|$|The {{implementation}} act {{for the new}} copyright law, law no. 5352-1 of July 9, 1993, {{stated that}} the copyright provisions from the 1991 Fundamentals were invalidated. It also stated that the new copyright law applied to <b>all</b> <b>works</b> on which the 50-year term for copyrights and neighbouring rights had not yet elapsed in 1993. Subsequently, a discussion amongst copyright specialists erupted about the precise meaning of this.|$|E
25|$|The Copyright law of 1993 had {{specified}} {{a general}} duration of copyrights of 50 years beyond an author's death, or 50 {{years since the}} publication of an anonymous work. The implementation act for the law made the new law apply retroactively, restoring copyrights (and neighbouring rights) on works on which the shorter copyright terms from the Soviet-era had already expired or which had not been copyrighted at all under Soviet law. In 2004, this copyright term was extended to 70 years for <b>all</b> <b>works</b> still copyrighted.|$|E
