5|$|Baccano! is a 2007 anime series {{directed}} by Takahiro Omori and produced by Brain's Base and Aniplex. The 16 episodes are {{adapted from the}} light novels {{of the same name}} written by Ryohgo Narita and illustrated by Katsumi Enami. Told in out-of-order sequences, the story spans three consecutive years of Prohibition-era America during which three seemingly unconnected events occur: two bottles of immortality elixir are passed around Manhattan by gangsters believing it is alcohol, a supposed monster massacres members of two gangs attempting to hijack the transcontinental train Flying Pussyfoot, and <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> tracked down by his sister and a gang. The first thirteen episodes aired in Japan from July 26, 2007 to November 1, 2007 on WOWOW, a Japanese pay-per-view station, and the final three were released direct-to-DVD. The series made its North American television debut when it started airing on the Funimation Channel after the channel transitioned to HD in September 2010.|$|E
5|$|The cover also {{features}} a blue dragon eating a human, the design {{of which was a}} direct reference to the sea serpent image from Olaus Magnus's book History of the Northern Peoples.

The cover art is almost completely composed of newspaper cuttings collaged together, even the image of the man and the dragon are newspaper cuttings which Seymour painted onto. Only the tree on the right, and the title text are not composed of newspaper cuttings. The tree is to pose as a simile for the tree under which Hester took his life in 2005.|$|E
