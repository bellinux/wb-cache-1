These range from personal memoirs by historical Paraguayan figures to passages from books written by Europeans in Paraguay at the time. [...] They are arranged by a 'Compiler' whose footnotes {{tell the story}} of how the book was put together. The body of the novel is composed of a polemical collection of versions of Paraguayan history. The first text is what the Supreme dictates to his assistant Patiño, <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> in the present. This includes the constant abuses Francia heaps upon Patiño and their attempts to discover the authors of a pasquinade, found nailed {{to the door of the}} Asunción Cathedral, that falsely announces Francia's death and burial arrangements. It is mostly Francia's vulgar rambling, including accusing meek Patiño of attempting to usurp him. The author of the pasquinade is never discovered in spite of their high scrutiny.|$|E

2500|$|Since Mahagonny was co-produced by Brecht, {{there is}} a {{prominent}} display of the Verfremdungseffekt, often translated as the [...] "alienation effect". Brecht and Weill wished to replace the old dramatic theater and its emphasis on emotions with epic theatre and its emphasis on reason. In the case of Brecht, it was more as a didactic tool for communist philosophy, but for Weill, {{it was more of}} a social scheme, a way to get people involved and thinking. The general scheme was to shake up people's preconceived notions and make them think <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> on stage, or to emotionally distance the audience from the action thus making logical evaluation of the play's events easier. Brecht and Weill used different methods to achieve this effect.|$|E

Later that day Cameron made a House of Commons statement on the Woolwich attack, saying that lessons must be learned. [...] "When young men born and bred in this country are radicalised and turned into killers, we have to ask some tough questions <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>happening</b> in our country. It is as if that for some young people there is a conveyor belt to radicalisation that has poisoned their minds with sick and perverted ideas. We need to dismantle this process at every stage – in schools, colleges, universities, on the internet, in our prisons, wherever it is taking place." ...|$|E
