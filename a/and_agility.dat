40|$|Background: Soccer players, {{independent}} of positions, perform high-intensity movements such as agility {{for short periods}} and have longer periods of low-intensity and rest during a soccer game. Agility {{is considered to be}} dependent on perceptional and decision-making factors and physical factors related to changes in directions. Most research has displayed no differences in different preplanned agility test within playing positions. However, no studies have been done on reactive agility within different positions on the soccer field. Aim: The {{purpose of the study was}} to compare if soccer players ́ reactive – <b>and</b> preplanned <b>agility</b> performance differs between their positions in the team. The study will also examine the level of correlation between results from reactive <b>agility</b> <b>and</b> preplanned <b>agility.</b> Methods: Thirty male soccer players, 17 - 19 years old, were tested in reactive <b>agility</b> <b>and</b> preplanned <b>agility.</b> The subjects were divided into three groups depending on their playing position, including defenders (n= 10), midfielders (n= 10) and forwards (n= 10). Mean scores for both agility tests were analyzed with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the criterion level for significance was set at 5 % (p ≤ 0. 05). Correlations were performed to study the relationship between reactive <b>agility</b> <b>and</b> preplanned <b>agility.</b> Following limits were used to determine the strength of the value of Pearson correlation; r=. 10 to. 29 small, r=. 30 to. 49 medium, r=. 50 to 1. 0 large. Results: No statistical significant differences between defenders, midfielders and forwards in neither reactive agility (p= 0. 624) or preplanned agility (p= 0. 481) were perceived. There was a small correlation (r= 0. 24) between all studied results from the reactive – <b>and</b> preplanned <b>agility</b> test. When positions were correlated within the two test, the highest correlation between reactive <b>agility</b> <b>and</b> preplanned <b>agility</b> was found in midfielders with a medium correlation (r= 0. 47) while small correlations appeared within defenders (r= 0. 28) and forwards (r=- 0. 11). Conclusions: The findings of this thesis showed no statistical significant differences between playing positions in reactive agility nor in preplanned agility. The impact of the soccer players’ integration with different soccer coaches could be an explanation to the reactive agility results where some coaches may focus on developing perceptual skills more than other coaches. The absence of differences in preplanned agility may suggest that the physical abilities needed to perform the Zig-Zag test did not differ among defenders, midfielders or forwards. It can also be suggested that reactive <b>agility</b> <b>and</b> preplanned <b>agility</b> are two independent variables who do not share characteristics. Future research should focus on incorporating a more valid reactive agility test for soccer players and study larger samples who are specialized in their positions. ...|$|R
5|$|With {{the rise}} of light cavalry, the stamina <b>and</b> <b>agility</b> of horses with Arabian blood gave an {{enormous}} military advantage to any army who possessed them.

5|$|By {{the early}} 16th century, horse teams were {{beginning}} to replace ox teams in ploughing work in Britain because of their greater speed, strength <b>and</b> <b>agility,</b> particularly on lighter soils; in heavier soils ox teams retained an advantage, both because they pulled more steadily, albeit more slowly, and because they could work despite being fed by grazing alone. While the horse collar, which allows a horse greater freedom to pull heavy loads, {{had been used in}} western Europe by the 10th century, and may be shown in the Bayeux Tapestry of the 11th or 12th century, the use of horse teams in Britain was made possible in part because of an increase in the farming of oats, a staple food for hard-working horses.|$|E

5|$|The defence {{mechanism}} {{relies on the}} memory of the would-be predator; a bird that has once experienced a foul-tasting grasshopper will endeavour to avoid a repetition of the experience. As a consequence, aposematic species are often gregarious. Before the memory of a bad experience attenuates, the predator may have the experience reinforced through repetition. Aposematic organisms often move in a languid fashion, as they have little need for speed <b>and</b> <b>agility.</b> Instead, their morphology is frequently tough and resistant to injury, thereby allowing them to escape once the predator is warned off.|$|E
5|$|Horse {{improvement}} as a goal, {{and horse}} breeding as an enterprise, date to medieval times; King John imported a hundred Flemish stallions, Edward III imported fifty Spanish stallions, and various priories and abbeys owned stud farms. Laws were passed restricting and prohibiting horse exports {{and for the}} culling of horses considered undesirable in type. By the 17th century, specific horse breeds were being recorded as suitable for specific purposes, and new horse-drawn agricultural machinery was being designed. Fast coaches pulled by teams of horses with Thoroughbred blood could make use of improved roads, and coaching inn proprietors owned hundreds of horses to support the trade. Steam power took {{over the role of}} horses in agriculture from the mid-19th century, but horses continued to be used in warfare for almost another 100 years, as their speed <b>and</b> <b>agility</b> over rough terrain remained unequalled. Working horses had all but disappeared from Britain by the 1980s, and today horses in Britain are kept almost wholly for recreational purposes.|$|E

5|$|Launched on 1 September 1939, the {{invasion}} began successfully. In Army Group South's {{area of responsibility}} under Rundstedt, the 8th, 10th and 14th Armies pursued the retreating Poles. The initial plan was for the 8th Army, the northernmost of the three, to advance towards Łódź. The 10th Army, with its motorised divisions, was to move quickly towards the Vistula, and the 14th Army was to advance and attempt to encircle the Polish troops in the Kraków area. These actions led to the encirclement and defeat of Polish forces in the Radom area on 8–14 September by six German corps. Meanwhile, the German Eighth Army was under attack from the north, so elements of the Fourth, Eighth and Tenth Armies were quickly redeployed with air support in an improvised attempt to cut off any Polish break-out back towards Warsaw. The flexibility <b>and</b> <b>agility</b> of the German forces led to the defeat of nine Polish infantry divisions and other units in the resulting Battle of the Bzura (8–19 September), the largest engagement of the war thus far. The conquest of Poland was quickly over, with the last Polish military units surrendering on 6 October.|$|E
