50|$|Glycerin soaps are soaps {{that contain}} glycerin, a {{component}} of fat or oil. They are recognizably different from other soaps because they are translucent.

50|$|The {{typical process}} {{involves}} the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> to the must {{so that the}} fermentation process is prematurely stopped. Most yeast dies when the alcohol content in their environment is raised to approximately 13-15%. By stopping the fermentation of sugars, a sweet taste of the wine is achieved. This technique is used to make port wine and other sweet wines with high alcohol content.|$|E
5000|$|For a {{substance}} to be halal, {{it must not}} contain alcohol of any kind. However, {{there is a difference}} drawn between the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> to foods, which is absolutely forbidden, and the small quantities that naturally become present - such as orange juice. Except for grape wine and grape juice (which must be manufactured under Jewish supervision), kashrut allows the consumption of any sort of alcohol, as long as it has kosher ingredients (excluding any unsupervised grape extracts).|$|E

It is produced by adding alcohol to non-fermented or partially fermented grape juice. The <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> stops the fermentation and, as a consequence Mistelle is sweeter than fully fermented grape juice in which the sugars turn to alcohol.|$|E

40|$|Abstract-The {{fluorescence}} quenching of the indole chromophore by NO; and the fluorescence de-polarization {{of several}} luminescence probes in aqueous solutions containing hexadecyltrimethylammo-nium bromide (HDTBr) were measured {{as a function}} of added C 2 -C 4 aliphatic alcohol concentration. The fluorescence decay profiles of pyrene in the micellar solutions were also measured to estimate the aggregation number of the micelles. The <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> n-butyl <b>alcohol</b> significantly reduces the fluor-escence quenching rate and the aggregation number and increases the extent of fluorescence depolariz-ation in HDTBr micellar systems. The <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> ethyl <b>alcohol</b> shows a similar but smaller effect.

50|$|Plasma {{proteins}} {{are separated}} by using the inherent differences of each protein. Fractionation involves changing {{the conditions of the}} pooled plasma (e.g., the temperature or the acidity) so that proteins that are normally dissolved in the plasma fluid become insoluble, forming large clumps, called precipitate. The insoluble protein can be collected by centrifugation. One of the very effective ways for carrying out this process is the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> to the plasma membrane pool while simultaneously cooling the pool. This process is sometimes called cold alcohol fractionation or ethanol fractionation. It was described by and bears the eponym of Dr Edwin J. Cohn. This procedure is carried out in a series of steps so that a single pool of plasma yields several different protein products, such as albumin and immune globulin. Human serum albumin prepared by this process is used in some vaccines, for treating burn victims, and other medical applications.|$|E
50|$|The Lightnings' engines were {{troubled by}} the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> used as an {{anti-knock}} compound in their fuel supply; a British war economy solution which caused problems with water condensation {{on the ground and}} fuel line icing at altitude. Another British attempt to correct fuel composition caused lead metal deposits to coat cylinders and foul plugs throughout the squadron. The -H series Lightnings did not have adequate cooling for extended high-power usage, as their engine development had outstripped the cooling capacity of the integral intercooler which ran through the wing's leading edge. Pilots were instructed to restrict their periods of highest engine power to defined time limits, but many did not. As a result of these various influences, the Group's Lightnings suffered a high rate of attrition. Nevertheless, 55FG P-38H pilots provided cover for missions against aircraft plants during Big Week in February 1944. Lt. Col. Jack Jenkins led the group on 3 March 1944, when they became the first Allied fighters to reach Berlin on an escort mission.|$|E

50|$|The {{increase}} in the B term, as related to longitudinal diffusion, {{is associated with the}} decrease in the solute diffusion coefficient in the mobile phase, DM, due to the presence of the micelles, and an {{increase in}} the capacity factor, k¢. Again, this is related to surfactant adsorption on the stationary phase causing a dramatic decrease in the solute diffusion coefficient in the stationary phase, DS. Again an increase in temperature, now coupled with an <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> to the mobile phase, drastically decreases the amount of the absorbed surfactant. In turn, both actions reduce the C term caused by a slow mass transfer from the stationary phase to the mobile phase. Further optimization of efficiency can be gained by reducing the flow rate to one closely matched to that derived from the Knox equation. Overall, the three proposed theories seemed to have contributing effects of the poor efficiency observed, and can be partially countered by the addition of organic modifiers, particularly alcohol, and increasing the column temperature.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a variety}} of {{beverages}} produced and marketed {{around the world as}} well as within each market which are described as coolers or alcopops. They tend to be sweet and served in small bottles (typically 355 ml (the normal size of a soda pop can) in the USA, 275 ml in South Africa and Germany, 330 ml in Canada and Europe), and between 4% and 7% ABV. In Europe, Canada, and South Africa coolers tend to be pre-mixed spirits, including vodka (e.g. Smirnoff Ice) or rum (e.g. Bacardi Breezer). In the United States, on the other hand, alcopops often start out as un-hopped beers, depending on the state in which they are sold. Much of the malt (and alcohol) is removed (leaving mostly water), with subsequent <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> (usually vodka or grain alcohol), sugar, coloring and flavoring. Such drinks are legally classified as beers in virtually all states and can therefore be sold in outlets that do not or cannot carry spirit-based drinks. There are, however, stronger ones that are simply pre-mixed spirits (e.g. Bacardi Rum Island Iced Tea), often containing about 12.5% alcohol by volume, that can be sold only where hard liquor is available.|$|E

Some ingredients in e-liquids could be flammable; this risk is more of concern for users who are inexperienced or do not use protective gear. Users can adjust the voltage of some e-cigarettes. The amount of vapor produced is controlled by the power of the battery, which has led some users to adjust their e-cigarettes to increase battery power to obtain a stronger nicotine [...] "hit", but there is a small risk of battery explosion.

30|$|It is not trivial {{to explain}} the role of {{methanol}} on the final particle size. In the literature, {{it has been shown}} that the <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> to microemulsions results in coalescence of micelles [45]. In this mechanism, the micelles should enlarge upon <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol.</b> This is indeed observed for addition of methanol or ethanol to AOT/water/n-decane systems [46]. In our system, another surfactant and oil phase is used and it is not evident that the two systems will behave in the same way. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements can provide information about the size of micelles and is used to study the size of micelles under varying reaction conditions. DLS measurements performed on 306  mM NP- 5 in cyclohexane showed the presence of particles with a mean hydrodynamic diameter of 3.5 [*]±[*] 1.3  nm. The size of the particles increases to 6.3 [*]±[*] 2.2  nm upon adding ammonia solution (28  wt.% in water) to the system. The increase in size indicates that the ammonia solution is incorporated into the micelles, forming small emulsion droplets.|$|E
