40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} {{synthesized}} method of a minimum variance adaptive control (MVAC) system {{to control the}} cutting force of the Computerized Numerical Control (CNC) <b>turning</b> <b>machine.</b> In this system a linearized state-space model for the CNC <b>turning</b> <b>machine</b> is derived, and a model reference adaptive system (MRAS), which includes the cutting force as a controlled output and the feed rate as a control input, is implemented. The deterministic autoregressive moving average (DARMA) model with auxiliary input is introduced to cope with any disturbances of the controlled system. The parameters of the DARMA model are obtained using {{the structure of a}} lattice adaptive control system. The robustness of the proposed controller copes with any changes in depth of cut and/or the cutting speed. These changes are embedded in the linearized model of the CNC machine and are considered as system parameters. Extensive computer simulations are made to prove the applicability of the proposed controller for controlling the cutting force over different operating conditions.

40|$|A <b>turning</b> <b>machine</b> tool {{is a kind}} of {{new type}} of machine tool that is {{equipped}} with more than one spindle and turret. The distinctive simultaneous and parallel processing abilities of <b>turning</b> <b>machine</b> tool increase the complexity of process planning. The operations would not only be sequenced and satisfy precedence constraints, but also should be scheduled with multiple objectives such as minimizing machining cost, maximizing utilization of <b>turning</b> <b>machine</b> tool, and so on. To solve this problem, a hybrid genetic algorithm was proposed to generate optimal process plans based on a mixed 0 - 1 integer programming model. An operation precedence graph is used to represent precedence constraints and help generate a feasible initial population of hybrid genetic algorithm. Encoding strategy based on data structure was developed to represent process plans digitally in order to form the solution space. In addition, a local search approach for optimizing the assignments of available turrets would be added to incorporate scheduling with process planning. A real-world case is used to prove that the proposed approach could avoid infeasible solutions and effectively generate a global optimal process plan...|$|R
