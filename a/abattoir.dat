5|$|The French {{position}} {{was such that}} they were able to lay down withering fire on the British forces as they advanced, and the abatis (a word that shares derivation with <b>abattoir,</b> or slaughterhouse) rapidly became a killing field. By about 2 pm, it was clear that the first wave of attack had failed. Montcalm was active on the battlefield, having removed his coat, and was moving among his men, giving encouragement and making sure all of their needs were being met. Abercrombie, who was reported by early historians like Francis Parkman and Thomas Mante to be at the sawmill (and thus well away from the action), was reported by his aide, James Abercrombie, to be near the rear of the lines by the La Chute River during much of the battle, and to have approached the front of the French lines at one point early in the battle. It is uncertain why, after the first wave of attack failed, Abercrombie persisted in ordering further attacks. Writing in his own defense, he later claimed that he was relying on Clerk's assessment that the works could be easily taken; this was clearly refuted by the failure of the first charge.|$|E
5|$|After {{shedding}} {{the burden}} of less profitable and unwieldy land with its angry residents, Burnside was on its own. The new Burnside District Council held its first meeting at the Greengate Inn, Tusmore on 19 August 1856. Due to {{the time it took}} to elect new councillors, it was not until 29 December that the council met again. Dr Christopher Penfold, chairman, met the rest of the representatives there: Daniel Ferguson of Glenunga, Alexander Ferguson of Monreith, John Townsend of Magill and James Grylls of Belle Vue. It was during this time that Kent Town decided against becoming a part of Burnside and instead applied to enter the Corporate Town of Kensington and Norwood. The council was to meet at the Inn or at Ferguson's home right up until December 1869, when the first council chambers were built. However, it was still able to operate and fulfill its obligations under the Local Government Act 1852. These included the management of minor roads, the administration of <b>abattoir</b> licences and public houses, and the prevention of the spread of the noxious Scotch thistle. The council was also obliged, under a different act of 1851, to encourage education. Much road and bridgework activity happened after the council had been formed—early residents were amazed at the influx of development and construction that occurred. At the same time, the council was almost overwhelmed by the amount of work requested, and was forced to ask individual ratepayers for monetary assistance when building bridges in their area.|$|E

40|$|The efficacies of {{electrical}} stimulation practices at Australian <b>abattoirs</b> that process significant proportions of Australian lamb and sheep meat were assessed. Several <b>abattoirs</b> used medium-voltage electrical stimulation system (MVS) units suboptimally and many carcasses at these <b>abattoirs</b> exhibited a poor rate of pH decline and, consequently, a low proportion of carcasses attained pH 6 at a carcass temperature of 18 - 35 degrees C, according to Sheep Meat Eating Quality pH-temperature guidelines as adopted by Meat Standards Australia. In the present communication, {{we describe the}} causes of suboptimal results with electrical stimulation and discuss procedures for optimising the stimulation dose delivered by MVS units. Carcass pH responses to various levels of current and pulse width were assessed {{to determine the best}} MVS settings for individual <b>abattoirs.</b> The MVS units at the <b>abattoirs</b> involved in the present study have now been programmed for optimal efficacy and carcass quality will be monitored on an ongoing basis. Evaluation of methods for assessing the proportion of carcasses that fall within the optimum pH-temperature window showed that a random regression model is more accurate than the current approach...|$|R
25|$|In 2000, Edward Hall {{presented}} the trilogy as a two-part series at the Watermill Theatre in Newbury. Hall followed the Jackson/Seale structure, combining 1 Henry VI and 2 Henry VI into one play {{that all but}} eliminated 1 Henry VI, and following this with an edited version of 3 Henry VI. This production was noted for how it handled {{the violence of the}} play. The set was designed to look like an <b>abattoir,</b> but rather than attempt to present the violence realistically (as most productions do), Hall went in the other direction, presenting the violence symbolically. Whenever a character was decapitated or killed, a red cabbage was sliced up whilst the actor mimed the death beside it.|$|E
25|$|On 4 November 1965, Fred accidentally {{ran over}} {{and killed a}} four-year-old boy named Michael O'Keefe with his van. Although cleared of any {{wrongdoing}} by police, Fred feared the hostile reaction and potential reprisals for the accident from the locals, whom he relied upon to make his living. Consequently, in December, he chose to return to Gloucester with Charmaine and Anna Marie, renting a caravan at the Timberland Caravan Park in Bishop's Cleeve. Rena joined him in February 1966, accompanied by both Isa McNeill and Anne McFall, who also moved into Fred's caravan. (McNeill and McFall both hailed from impoverished backgrounds; both hoped to find work in England.) Shortly after the move south, Fred found employment driving a lorry for a local <b>abattoir.</b>|$|E

40|$|Beef carcass quality, {{yield and}} causes of condemnations in Ethiopia were {{investigated}} in this study. Data was collected from Abergelle, Adama, Elfora Bishoftu, Elfora Kombolcha, Elfora Melgawendo, Hawassa, and Mekelle local and export <b>abattoirs</b> {{which include a}} total of 88, 299 cattle. The study indicated that management practices at the <b>abattoirs</b> contribute to the poor quality of carcasses. The average carcass weight at the local <b>abattoirs</b> was 135. 90 + 0. 69 kg. Carcass weight was significantly (p< 0. 001) different between <b>abattoirs,</b> season, conformation grades, fat grades and categories of cattle. Superior conformation and fat grades were lower for cows and castrated bulls compared to other categories of cattle. The average live weight, carcass weight and dressing percentage at the export <b>abattoirs</b> were 241. 41 + 0. 37 kg, 106. 93 + 0. 21 kg and 44. 21 + 0. 05 %, respectively. Live weight, carcass weight and dressing percentage were significantly (p< 0. 001) differ between <b>abattoirs,</b> season and breeds. Average meat yield and yield percentage were 61. 56 + 0. 94 kg and 67. 81 + 0. 33 %, respectively. Meat yield and weight of primal meat cuts were significantly (p< 0. 001) different between breeds of cattle. Only 31. 13 % of total carcasses sampled had an acceptable ultimate pH of 5. 4 - 5. 7. 170 whole carcasses, 52, 437 partial carcasses {{and a number of}} organs were condemned {{out of a total of}} 62, 917 cattle slaughtered. The main causes of condemnations of carcasses and organs were poor bleeding, bruising, contamination, abscess, hydatid cyst, pneumonia, nephritis, pericarditis and cysticercus bovis. The financial loss due to condemnation of carcasses and organs at one of the <b>abattoirs</b> was about 771, 666. 9 ETB (38, 953. 40 USD). From this study it was concluded that main factors that affected carcass quality of cattle in Ethiopia were poor management practices at the <b>abattoirs,</b> very low level of carcass fat, low proportion of carcass with desired pH for acceptable conversion of muscle to meat and higher level of condemnations of carcasses and organs. It is therefore recommended that developing law governing <b>abattoirs</b> operation, implementing good management program at <b>abattoirs,</b> proper feeding of cattle before slaughter and proper handling of cattle during transport will improve the quality of carcasses in Ethiopia.

25|$|Pogor {{also took}} care of various other projects, {{ensuring}} {{that the city was}} compensated by the central government for having lost its status of state capital: 10 million lei entered the city budget (6 of which were compensation from the Romanian state), and 8 neighboring estates were merged into the metropolitan area. He moved the City Hall into Roznovanu Palace, ordering works to begin on the Iași National Theatre, public bathing facilities, ten primary schools, and a new <b>Abattoir.</b> Under Pogor, the streets of Iași were paved with macadam, gas lighting was extended, and sanitation works were started. Casa Pogor was the city's first electrically-lit building.

25|$|Biogas from {{sewage sludge}} {{treatment}} is sometimes {{used to run}} a gas engine to produce electrical power, {{some or all of}} which can be used to run the sewage works. Some waste heat from the engine is then used to heat the digester. The waste heat is, in general, enough to heat the digester to the required temperatures. The power potential from sewage works is limited – in the UK, there are about 80MW total of such generation, with the potential to increase to 150MW, which is insignificant compared to the average power demand in the UK of about 35,000MW. The scope for biogas generation from nonsewage waste biological matter – energy crops, food waste, <b>abattoir</b> waste, etc. - is much higher, estimated to be capable of about 3,000MW. Farm biogas plants using animal waste and energy crops are expected to contribute to reducing CO2 emissions and strengthen the grid, while providing UK farmers with additional revenues.|$|E

25|$|Employers {{were forced}} to improve working {{conditions}} and to provide severance pay and accident compensation, {{the conditions under which}} workers could be dismissed were restricted, a system of labour courts to handle the grievances of workers was established, the working day was reduced in various industries, and paid holidays/vacations were generalised to the entire workforce. Perón also passed a law providing minimum wages, maximum hours and vacations for rural workers, froze rural rents, presided over a large increase in rural wages, and helped lumber, wine, sugar and migrant workers organize themselves. From 1943 to 1946, real wages grew by only 4%, but in 1945 Perón established two new institutions that would later increase wages: the “aguinaldo” (a bonus that provided each worker with a lump sum {{at the end of the}} year amounting to one-twelfth of the annual wage) and the National Institute of Compensation, which implemented a minimum wage and collected data on living standards, prices, and wages. Leveraging his authority on behalf of striking <b>abattoir</b> workers and the right to unionise, Perón became increasingly thought of as presidential timber.|$|E
25|$|Between 1985 and 1987, Associated Dairies Group PLC, and Asda Stores Ltd, {{merged with}} MFI (Mullard Furniture Industries) {{and the group}} was renamed Asda-MFI Group plc. The other {{companies}} in the group were Associated Dairies Limited, the furniture retailer MFI and Allied Carpets. After the sale of MFI in 1987, the company name changed to Asda Group plc. The Associated Dairies division was renamed as Associated Fresh Foods, the <b>abattoir</b> and meat processing plant at Lofthouse, near Wakefield, which supplied fresh meat to all Asda stores was renamed as Lofthouse Foods. The focus of the group had switched firmly by the late 1980s to the Asda store chain. In 1988, Asda had also acquired the Waring & Gillow, Colonel Gee, and Maple & Co furniture brands and Maples stores. Co-branded stores under the Allied Maples banner had appeared on major retail parks. But, in 1993, the whole fresh food division, including the Asda Produce, fruit and vegetable sourcing, processing and packing plant in Normanton, Wakefield, was sold off in a management buyout to other dairy and food processors. In the same year, Maples was divested in a management buyout, and became an independent company again until it went into liquidation in 1997, and the stores were bought out by the now defunct Allders department store chain. Allied Carpets {{and some of the}} co-branded Allied Maples stores were sold off to the now defunct Carpetland. This means that Asda has since had no connection with any of the firms from which its name was derived. Having effectively outgrown and divested of its original parent company, Associated Dairies, where it was only initially believed in 1965, that the tiny Asda supermarket division would only be a minor contributor to the dairy divisions profits, which at that time consisted of their wider and more profitable interests, including farms, dairies, butcher's shops, bakeries and doorstep milk deliveries.|$|E
