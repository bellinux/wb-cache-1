5|$|The Ministries of Japan (行政機関) {{consist of}} eleven {{ministries}} and the Cabinet Office. Each ministry {{is headed by}} a Minister of State, which are mainly senior legislators, and are appointed from {{among the members of}} the Cabinet by the Prime Minister. The Cabinet Office, formally headed by the Prime Minister, is an agency that handles the day-to-day affairs of the Cabinet. The ministries are the most influential part of the daily-exercised executive power, and since few ministers serve for more than <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> necessary to grab hold of the organisation, most of its power lies within the senior bureaucrats.|$|E
5|$|The other game Ahl {{originally}} ported to BASIC, Lunar Lander, {{appeared in}} the book in three different forms. The original version of the game was called Lunar, and was originally written in FOCAL for the PDP-8 by Jim Storer while {{a high school student}} in the fall of 1969. A different version called Rocket was written in BASIC by Eric Peters at DEC, and a third version, LEM, was written by William Labaree II in BASIC. Ahl converted Jim Storer's FOCAL version to BASIC, changed some of the text, and published it in his newsletter. <b>A</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> later, all three BASIC versions of the game appeared in 101 BASIC Computer Games, under the names ROCKET (Storer version), ROCKT1 (Peters version), and ROCKT2 (Labaree version). All three text-based games required the player to control a rocket attempting to land on the moon by entering instructions to the rocket in response to the textual summary of its current position and heading relative to the ground. Ahl and Steve North converted all three versions to Microsoft BASIC, changed the collective name to Lunar Lander, and published them in Creative Computing magazine in 1976; that name was used in the 1978 edition of BASIC Computer Games.|$|E

Ba Nyan left for London in 1921, but only spent <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> <b>so</b> at the Royal College of Art, partly {{because he could not}} follow the lectures in English and partly because the training at the college was tedious and slow.

When the band returned home, Nastasi resigned and helped co-found the band Non-Fiction with former members of Hades.

In South East Asia the third season was broadcast in 1996 via the MTV South East Asia channel, {{which at the time}} was free to anyone with a satellite dish. In the UK, MTV first showed the shorts and the 30-minute episodes from 1992. In the mid-1990s, the BBC showed the Liquid Television shorts, which included all of the Æon Flux shorts. Locomotion played the third season repeatedly, between 1998–1999 and 2002–2003, in Spanish and Portuguese for Latin America.

The DC-4 returned to San Francisco as Flight 2; the Constellation left Calcutta 1330 Tuesday, stopped at Karachi, Istanbul, London, Shannon, Gander, and arrived LaGuardia Thursday at 1455. A few months later PA 3 took over the Manila route while PA 1 shifted to Tokyo and Shanghai. All Pan Am round-the-world flights included at least one change of plane until Boeing 707s took over in 1960.

On August 16, 2008 (one day after the Independence Day of India), the gay community in Mumbai held its first ever formal pride parade (although informal pride parades had been held many times earlier), to demand that India's anti-gay laws be amended. A high court in the Indian capital, Delhi ruled on July 2, 2009, that homosexual intercourse between consenting adults was not a criminal act, although the Supreme Court later reversed its decision in 2013 under widespread pressure from powerful conservative and religious groups, leading to the re-criminalization of homosexuality in India.|$|E
