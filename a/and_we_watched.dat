25|$|The {{passengers}} {{were put into}} the seven ship's boats:The steamer had struck nearly in the centre; her fore part was sunk very deep, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> her with the greatest anxiety {{to see if the}} water gained on her, fearing for the safety of those still on board, and also dreading that if she sank our boats would all be swamped. We rowed backwards and forwards between the rocks and the steamer all night, and a weary time it was. Guns were fired, and rockets sent up; but our signals of distress were not answered, though a light we saw at some distance on the shore made us hopeful that assistance was at hand. The masts were cut down to lighten the ship, and the crash as they fell into the water sounded very fearful.|$|E
2500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "Flawless" [...] was {{directed}} by Jake Nava. It was released on December 13, 2013 on the album Beyoncé on the iTunes Store, which contained a video for every song. [...] Beyoncé worked on the choreography for the video with Les Twins and Chris Grant. [...] "We had done half the video, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> it, and Beyoncé knew that it needed a dance moment that would be iconic, that people could pick up on. And then we went back and reshot that part. Because after seeing the video, and after the song coming together, she was like, 'This needs a cool dance that anybody can do'", said Beyoncé's creative director Todd Tourso.|$|E
2500|$|The Titanic indeed had a [...] list to port leaving Southampton. [...] Inadequate {{trimming}} {{of cargo}} and bunkers would likely result in such {{and the crew}} seems to have demonstrated a lack of proficiency on several occasions. [...] A list to port was noted by several Titanic survivors including Lawrence Beesley who wrote in his book about the sinking: [...] "I then called the attention of our table {{to the way the}} Titanic listed to port (I had noticed this before), <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> the skyline through the portholes as we sat at the purser's table in the saloon." [...] (The dining saloon windows were double rows of portholes covered on the inside with screens of leaded decorative glass with no clear view of the outdoors.) [...] This was echoed by [...] survivor Norman Chambers, who testified that after the collision: [...] "However, there was then a slight list to starboard, with probably a few degrees in pitch; and as the ship had a list to port nearly all afternoon, I decided to remain up." ...|$|E

El Ayachi in his {{handwritten}} Arrihla al ayachia 1662 say :"... personage who {{was placed in}} a state of open rebellion, sedition which began in this town.

50|$|The video pauses <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> as {{the detectives}} {{contemplate}} Steven {{as the first}} victim. We also {{find out about the}} mystery woman on the bus, Katrina Fleishman. Katrina is the wife of a military man hospitalized with post traumatic stress disorder. Katrina withdrew her husbands savings worth $90,000 in cash and left town.|$|R
2500|$|Chris Matthews of MSNBC {{referred}} to the speech as [...] "what many of us think {{is one of the}} great speeches in American history, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> a lot of them."

50|$|In the present, Carter {{has become}} a shadow of his former promise, a {{lethargic}} teacher, an alcoholic, excessive smoker, lacking the ability to sustain relationships. Like Sanford, he has {{worked his way through}} a series of graduate assistant girlfriends, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> as he apparently allows his relationship with Susan (Lynn Chen) to wither away. Carter is on a reckless path until he receives notice that Sanford has died of cancer.|$|R

60|$|Aurelia {{was still}} on the stoop. The moon was higher and the ivy shadows were deeper. I sat at her side <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> a little cloud tilt at the {{drifting}} moon and go asunder quite pale and discomfited.|$|E
60|$|In {{a moment}} the Union Jack of Old England was waving at the mast-head in the gentle breeze, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> anxiously for a reply. The {{stranger}} was polite; his colours flew up a moment after, and displayed the Stripes and Stars of America.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only on {{the cliff}} walk. Lord Ivinghoe {{took me to}} see the place where his father had the accident, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> the {{fireworks}} from there. Oh, it was so nice, and still more beautiful when the strange lights were out and the people gone, and only the lovely quiet moon shining on the sea, and a path of light from Venus." ...|$|E
60|$|Captain Dan {{complied}} <b>and</b> <b>we</b> all <b>watched.</b> <b>We</b> all saw {{an enormous}} colorful body loom up, take {{the shape of}} a fish, come back of R. C.'s bait, hit it and take it.|$|R

60|$|I met Tom {{coming in}} from the field with his rawhide harness over his shoulders. Polly Ann stood calling him in the door, and the {{squirrel}} broth was steaming on the table. He did not wait for it. Kissing her, he flung himself into the saddle I had left, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> him mutely as he waved back to us {{from the edge of the}} woods.|$|E
60|$|She had {{the last}} word on the subject, for it was time for Sara Ray to go, and our circle broke up. Sara and Felix {{departed}} <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> them down the lane in the moonlight--Sara walking demurely in one runner track, and Felix stalking grimly along in the other. I fear the romantic beauty of that silver shining night was entirely thrown away on my mischievous brother.|$|E
60|$|I {{ran back}} to the fort, and when I had gotten my drum the three {{companies}} were falling into line, the men murmuring in undertones among themselves. They were brought to attention. Colonel Clark was seen {{to come out of the}} commandant's house, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> him furtively as he walked slowly to his place in front of the line. A tremor of excitement went from sergeant to drummer boy. The sentries closed the big gates of the fort.|$|E

Jacinta Haseldine is a lanky, 16 -year-old Aboriginal girl, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> her confidently working a shovel, with bare feet, into soft clay that swirls orange, yellow <b>and</b> white.

60|$|So <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> {{the dragon}} leap and twist {{and get the}} knight by the leg: <b>and</b> then perish. <b>We</b> <b>watched</b> the knights burst into the castle. <b>We</b> <b>watched</b> the {{wonderful}} armour-clashing embraces of the delivered knights, Orlando and his bosom friend and the little dwarf, clashing their armoured breasts to the breasts of their brothers <b>and</b> deliverers. <b>We</b> <b>watched</b> the would-be tears flow.--And then the statue of the witch suddenly go up in flames, at which a roar of exultation from the boys. Then it was over. The theatre was empty in a moment, but the proprietors {{and the two men}} who sat near us would not let us go. We must wait for the next performance.|$|R
60|$|They {{did not see}} us, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> {{them for}} some time. They were wild dogs. In the rock-wall was a {{horizontal}} fissure--evidently the lair where their mother had left them, and where they should have remained had they been obedient. But the growing life, that in Lop-Ear and me had impelled us to venture away from the forest, had driven the puppies {{out of the cave}} to frolic. I know how their mother would have punished them had she caught them.|$|E
60|$|All {{this was}} true enough; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> the effect of our change of course with the {{greatest}} anxiety. All hands were called, and the men were stationed, in readiness to work the ship. But, a few minutes satisfied us, the hope of clawing off, in so light an air, was to the last degree vain. The vessel set in fast towards the reef, the breakers on which now became apparent, even {{by the light of}} the moon; the certain sign they were fearfully near.|$|E
60|$|Lyme Regis {{was but a}} {{few days}} distant when, {{not for the first time}} since our meeting at Mrs Bowater's gatepost, I set off to meet Mr Anon--this time to share with him my {{wonderful}} news. When showers drifted across the sun-shafted sky we took refuge under the shelter of the garden-house. As soon as the hot beams set the raindrops smouldering, so that every bush was hung with coloured lights, we returned to my smoking stone. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> a rainbow arch and fade in the windy blue.|$|E
50|$|Feisty <b>and</b> unstoppable, <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> as she {{transformed}} {{her life}} from {{a dead end}} job in a nail bar in the East End of London to training up as a serving soldier in the British Army Medical Corps.|$|R

60|$|This {{seemed to}} sort of lighten the boat, and it went on much easier, the small boy {{shouting}} {{at the top of}} his voice, and urging his steed into a gallop. The fellows sat up and stared at one another. It was some seconds before they realised what had happened to them, but, when they did, they began to shout lustily for the boy to stop. He, however, was too much occupied with the horse to hear them, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> them, flying after him, until the distance hid them from view.|$|E
60|$|We {{played a}} little at gardening, of course, and planted tomatoes, which the {{chickens}} seemed to like, for they ate them up {{as fast as they}} ripened; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> with pride the growth of our Lawton blackberries, which, after attaining the most stalwart proportions, were still as bitter as the scrubbiest of their savage brethren, and which, when by advice left on the vines for a week after they turned black, were silently gorged by secret and gluttonous flocks of robins and orioles. As for our grapes, the frost cut them off in the hour of their triumph.|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} sitting {{in one of}} the recesses {{at the end of the}} big saloon with Mrs. Redmondson, one of those sharp-minded, beautiful rich women one meets so often in London, who seem to have done nothing and to be capable of everything, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> the crowd--uniforms and splendours were streaming in from a State ball--and exchanged information. I told her about the politicians and intellectuals, and she told me about the aristocrats, and we sharpened our wit on them and counted the percentage of beautiful people among the latter, and wondered if the general effect of tallness was or was not an illusion.|$|E

6000|$|... "How d'ye do, my darter? is {{your daddy}} at home?" [...] "My darter" [...] usually makes off {{as fast as}} possible, in an unconquerable giggle. Father Morris goes into the house, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> him at every turn, as, with the most liberal simplicity, he makes himself at home, takes off his wig, wipes down his great face with a checked pocket handkerchief, helps himself hither and thither to {{whatever}} he wants, and asks {{for such things as}} he cannot lay his hands on, with all the comfortable easiness of childhood.|$|R
