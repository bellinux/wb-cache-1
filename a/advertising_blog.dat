40|$|This study {{examines}} how consumers ’ {{interest in a}} new movie develops around paid and earned media in pre-launch periods, how this interest impacts opening-week revenue, and how post-launch revenue of a movie is influenced by advertising and various earned media. The pre-launch, opening-week and post-launch worlds are structurally different and we therefore develop three separate models, two multiple-time series models and one cross-sectional equation. These models are applied to a panel data set of movies consisting of movie descriptors, weekly <b>advertising,</b> <b>blog</b> postings, search volume, user reviews and revenue. We find, first, that consumer interest evolves in the pre-launch periods, as evidenced by non-stationary weekly blogging and searching activity. While commercial advertising {{plays a role in}} stimulating consumer information search, blogging by movie buffs is more influential. Managerially, this underscores the value of designing ads that create strong viral effects. Second, we demonstrate the value of pre-launch consumer search as a leading indicator of movie revenue, as it improves the studios ’ ability to predict opening-week revenue. Finally, the effects of blog postings change drastically after movie launch. In these post-launch periods, advertising and user review volume have significant effects on movie revenue, while blog postings lose their influence. The paper concludes with a description of several managerial implications of our findings...|$|E
40|$|Since 2000, blogs have rapidly {{become a}} {{cyberspace}} phenomenon. The new medium {{has created a}} growing trend: <b>blog</b> <b>advertising.</b> <b>Blogs</b> offer unique advantages over other types of advertising, such as reader coverage and low cost. In addition, blogs generally contain customer comments, which new customers can use to evaluate the advertised products. As a result, <b>blog</b> <b>advertising</b> is very successful. A recent survey showed that 40 % of the customers that read <b>blog</b> <b>advertising</b> made a purchase. This study investigates factors that affect <b>blog</b> <b>advertising</b> effectiveness. A laboratory experiment was designed {{to determine the effects}} of appeal strategies, quantity and quality of negative comments, and customer involvement with the advertised product. The experiment was designed to test informational and. emotional appeal strategies, high and low proportions of negative comments, high and low qualities of negative comments, and high and low levels of customer involvement with the advertised product. Study results show that informational appeals match customer needs, for customers with high levels of customer involvement. Study results show that emotional appeals match customer needs, for customers with low levels of customer involvement. Study results show that proportion of negative comments has an effect, for any type of customer. Study results show that high-quality negative comments affect customer attitudes more than low-quality negative comments, for customers with high levels of customer involvement. Study results extend theoretical and practical knowledge concerning factors that effect <b>blog</b> <b>advertising</b> effectiveness...|$|R

25|$|Consumer-generated {{advertising}} {{is a relatively}} new and controversial development, and it has created a new model of marketing communication from businesses to consumers. Among the various forms of <b>advertising</b> on <b>blog,</b> the most controversial are the sponsored posts. These are blog entries or posts and may be in the form of feedback, reviews, opinion, videos, etc. and usually contain a link back to the desired site using a keyword or several keywords. Blogs have led to some disintermediation and a breakdown of the traditional advertising model, where companies can skip over the advertising agencies (previously the only interface with the customer) and contact the customers directly via social media websites. On the other hand, new companies specialised in <b>blog</b> <b>advertising</b> have been established, {{to take advantage of this}} new development as well. However, there are many people who look negatively on this new development. Some believe that any form of commercial activity on blogs will destroy the blogosphere’s credibility.|$|R

This chapter discusses the unique nature of blogs {{and the growing}} power of consumer generated content. This raises {{a number of questions}} as well as new opportunities. As the authors point out that existing literature on blog marketing only discusses the possible advantages of using blogs as a marketing tool and the addition of blogs into the marketing mix. However, the problem is that these studies totally ignored consumers’ perception towards blogs that carry advertisements. The rise of advertising companies that have stepped in to fill the gap between companies and bloggers, are discussed. Some examples of successful <b>blog</b> <b>advertising</b> campaigns are also provided. This chapter also presents a conceptual model that examines the salient factors that are likely to influence consumer attitude towards <b>blogs</b> and towards <b>advertising</b> in <b>blogs,</b> and more specifically on sponsored posts on blogs.

40|$|Currently, the {{internet}} is the main product information source for many consumergoods, {{mainly because of the}} irruption of consumer reviews based on blogging. Messages placed on them are usually perceived as a reliable and independent source of information, compared to traditional <b>advertising.</b> Also, <b>blogs</b> are websites that have a high personal nature perception. Using a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design, this study seeks {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} blogging commercial messages, measuring the influence of the message sidedness, communicator expertise and advertising intent and tests their influence over advertising effectiveness (measured as credibility and behavioral intention). Results show the relevance of using two-sided messages, expert sources and unbiased (non-sponsored) messages in terms of increase blog credibility and behavioral intention toward the reviewed product.

40|$|This thesis {{helps to}} address the gap in {{literature}} relating {{to the study of}} the provision of information to consumers, consumer information search behaviour and consumer information processing and choice behaviour relating to information-intensive products. Throughout the thesis, wine is taken as an example of an information-intensive product. Through a series of four published papers in peer reviewed journals, the thesis examines how firms can control and manipulate the provision of information to consumers and that by restricting the availability of information, the firm can make its target consumers want the product even more. Although secrecy has existed for centuries, as a marketing tool it is relatively new and little is understood about its power or purpose in marketing strategy. The thesis also analyses how consumers process information relating to information-intensive products using mental shortcuts, or heuristics, to substitute price for product quality at increasing rates of product consumption. Finally, the thesis provides a new way in which to segment the luxury wine market based on consumer knowledge together with the timing of consumption. The thesis provides a number of interesting advancements in marketing and consumer behaviour research. The first advancement examines whether secret wine societies are actually that secret at all and finds that they are not; however this finding does not absolve the need for marketers to use secrecy as a marketing tool. The second advancement provides insight into <b>advertising,</b> <b>blogs</b> and consumer innovativeness and finds a positive relationship between attitude toward advertising and consumer innovativeness. The third advancement finds evidence that consumers’ process information by using the price-quality heuristic, for both sighted and blind tasting experiments. Furthermore, the study finds that blind tasting (deliberate thinking) reinforces sighted tasting (automatic thinking) which contributes to judgement errors about product quality. The fourth advancement is to provide a new way to segment the luxury wine market based on consumer objective knowledge, frequency of consumption and timing of consumption. QC 20160518 </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we propose a novel, passive {{approach}} for detecting and tracking malicious flux service networks. Our detection system is based on passive analysis of recursive DNS (RDNS) traffic traces collected from multiple large networks. Contrary to previous work, our approach {{is not limited to the}} analysis of suspicious domain names extracted from spam emails or precompiled domain blacklists. Instead, our approach is able to detect malicious flux service networks in-the-wild, i. e., as they are accessed by users who fall victims of malicious content <b>advertised</b> through <b>blog</b> spam, instant messaging spam, social website spam, etc., beside email spam. We experiment with the RDNS traffic passively collected at two large ISP networks. Overall, our sensors monitored more than 2. 5 billion DNS queries per day from millions of distinct source IPs for a period of 45 days. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to accurately detect malicious flux service networks. Furthermore, we show how our passive detection and tracking of malicious flux service networks may benefit spam filtering applications. I...|$|R
