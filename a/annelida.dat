50|$|Two {{organisms that}} {{contribute}} to the bioturbation of soil are Nephtys caeca (Fabricius) and Nereis virens (Sars) <b>annelidae.</b> They dig, bioirrigate, and feed in the sediment and they homogenize the particles found in the sediment when they partake in these activities because of their erratic movements. The bioirrigation generated by these organisms modifies the distribution of dinoflagellate cysts in the sedimentary column. They either bury them or raise them back to the surface, keeping them rotating. One of the most important dinoflagellates that these organisms help distribute is called noxious microalgae and it is responsible for the formation of toxic red tides. These red tides poison mollusks and crustaceans which results in very important economic losses in the fishing industry.|$|R

40|$|Benthic macroinvertebrates and physico-chemical {{parameters}} {{were surveyed}} {{at the source}} of the Karasu Brook in Bozüyük, Bilecik Province, Turkey, and at the inlets and outlets of five rainbow trout farms that use the brook water and discharge effluents into it. The dissolved oxygen, pH, ammonia-nitrogen, nitrite-nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen and total phosphorus in the farm effluents were within effluent standards for trout farming in different countries. The macroinvertebrate community in the brook consisted of Mollusca, Gastropoda (Physidae, Limnaedae, Planorbidae, Neritidae), Bivalvia (Spharidae), <b>Annelidae,</b> Oligochaeta (Tubificidae), Hirudinea (Glos- siphonidae, Erpobdellidae), Arthropoda, Insecta (Chironomidae, Ephemerellidae) and Crustacea (Gammaridae, Asellidae). Tubificidae and Chironomidae were generally observed in all sampling stations; the highest abundance was in the inlets and outlets of the two farms nearest the source.

25|$|There is {{no clear}} {{consensus}} on the taxonomy of helminths; it {{is more of a}} commonly used term to describe certain worms with superficial similarities. These are flatworms (platyhelminthes), namely cestodes (tapeworms) and trematodes (flukes), and roundworms or nemathelminths (nematodes) – both of these are parasitic worm types – and the <b>annelida,</b> which are not parasitic or at the most ectoparasites like the leeches.|$|E
25|$|The marine {{invertebrate}} collection {{is composed of}} specimens from taxa other than crustaceans and molluscs. It includes <b>Annelida,</b> Brachiopoda, Bryozoa, Cestoda, Cephalochordata, Hemichordata, Cnidaria, Ctenophora, Echinodermata, Echiura, Entoprocta, Nematoda, Foraminifera, Phoronida, Rotifera, Turbellaria, Trematoda, Urochordata, Porifera, Priapulida and Sipuncula. Specimens are mostly marine (Western Atlantic and Antarctic Ocean), but some are neotropical freshwater and terrestrial. Containing nearly 200,000 lots and 200 type specimens, the collection was built with the efforts of late-19th-century researchers including Ernst and Eveline Marcus, Gilberto Righi, Luis Roberto Tommasi, Antonio Sérgio Ferreira Ditadi, Jeanete Maron Ramos, Gertrude Rita Kloss and Sérgio de Almeida Rodrigues.|$|E
25|$|The Lophotrochozoa, evolved within Protostomia, {{include two}} of the most {{successful}} animal phyla, the Mollusca and <b>Annelida.</b> The former, which is the second-largest animal phylum by number of described species, includes animals such as snails, clams, and squids, and the latter comprises the segmented worms, such as earthworms and leeches. These two groups have long been considered close relatives because of the common presence of trochophore larvae, but the annelids were considered closer to the arthropods because they are both segmented. Now, this is generally considered convergent evolution, owing to many morphological and genetic differences between the two phyla. Lophotrochozoa also includes the Nemertea or ribbon worms, the Sipuncula, and several phyla that have a ring of ciliated tentacles around the mouth, called a lophophore. These were traditionally grouped together as the lophophorates. but it now appears that the lophophorate group may be paraphyletic, with some closer to the nemerteans and some to the molluscs and annelids. They include the Brachiopoda or lamp shells, which are prominent in the fossil record, the Entoprocta, the Phoronida, and possibly the Bryozoa or moss animals.|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 970 {{individuals}} of American plaice and 1999 individuals of yellowtail flounder were sampled from six hauls carry {{out in a}} period of 24 hours for studying the feeding chronology. The main prey of yellowtail flounder were gammaridae (19, 5 %), A. dubius (10, 1 %) <b>Annelidae</b> (6, 3 %), Mysidacea (6 %) and Antozoa (%, 6 %). The predominant preys in American plaice were A. dubius (72, 3 %) followed by Mysidacea (8, 5 %) and E. Parma (6, 1 %). Significant differences to the average values of Fulness Index between hauls were obtained for both species. But for the Mean Weight Fulness Index values only for yellowtail flounder significant differences were noted. During a composite 24 -hour day peak stomach content weight occurred at nightfall (21 h) in yellowtail flounder. In the American plaice occurred at dawn. These two species present a lesser feed intensity during the night. This feeding behaviour {{may be related to the}} different catchability by day/night...|$|R

The research was carried out at 6 sampling site and the abundance and diversity of benthos were monitored {{along the length of}} river between 2007 _ 2008 _ 14 families were recorded in phyla, namely <b>Annelidae,</b> Mollusca, [...] The greatest number of species was at 1 st station and the least number was at 6 th station. The upper section supported more diverse community then the lower section. A low macro invertebrate abundance was observed during spring as a result of heavy rainfall and flood, and generally in all lowest section because of high valve of nitrogen and other nutrients. Water physiochemical parameters such as Phosphate, Nitrate,TPS and others were measured and water quality were studied through different indices such as saprobic system, Helsinhoff (FBI), BMWP and the results were compared and evaluated by physical chemical and parameters. The result indicated that the water quality in the up stream and the middle were good to fair, but the down stream qualities were pour at all sites...|$|R
40|$|The Congo Clawless Otter (Aonyx congicus), is {{a little-known}} otter species that inhabits central African rivers and swamps. We {{report on the}} results of 3 field expeditions into the Dji Dji River, (Ivindo National Park, Gabon) of varying length (3 days to 6 weeks) to collect {{preliminary}} observations on this species, the sympatric spot-necked otter (Lutra maculicollis), and the fish community of the Dji Dji River. We also surveyed local people (primarily artisanal fishermen) in the Makokou area of Ivindo National Park about their knowledge of otter species and human/wildlife conflicts in the area. Sightings of otters in 2010 indicated both otter species to be common on the Dji Dji River. Fish sampling in 2011 indicated high abundance but low diversity of fishes in this blackwater river. Feeding observations of a solitary animal on the Dji Dji and a family of 3 on the Ivindo River indicate a high dependence on large earthworms (<b>Annelidae)</b> captured near the river’s edge. With a severe drought in 2011 affecting the Dji Dji River level, we found fewer otters compared to 2010 observations and no families with young. We speculate on the possibility of seasonal downstream movements, which could affect conservation of the species in the region...|$|R
25|$|Several other {{invertebrates}} {{have been}} domesticated, both terrestrial and aquatic, including {{some such as}} Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies and the freshwater cnidarian Hydra for research into genetics and physiology. Few {{have a long history}} of domestication. Most are used for food or other products such as shellac and cochineal. The phyla involved are Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes (for biological control), <b>Annelida,</b> Mollusca, Arthropoda (marine crustaceans as well as insects and spiders), and Echinodermata. While many marine molluscs are used for food, only a few have been domesticated, including squid, cuttlefish and octopus, all used in research on behaviour and neurology. Terrestrial snails in the genera Helix and Murex are raised for food. Several parasitic or parasitoidal insects including the fly Eucelatoria, the beetle Chrysolina, and the wasp Aphytis are raised for biological control. Conscious or unconscious artificial selection has many effects on species under domestication; variability can readily be lost by inbreeding, selection against undesired traits, or genetic drift, while in Drosophila, variability in eclosion time (when adults emerge) has increased.|$|E
500|$|Nemerteans' affinities with <b>Annelida</b> (including Echiura, Pogonophora, Vestimentifera {{and perhaps}} Sipuncula) and Mollusca make the ribbon-worms members of Lophotrochozoa, which [...] include {{about half of}} the extant animal phyla. Lophotrochozoa groups: those animals that feed using a lophophore (Brachiopoda, Bryozoa, Phoronida, Entoprocta); phyla in which most members' embryos develop into trochophore larvae (for example <b>Annelida</b> and Mollusca); and some other phyla (such as Platyhelminthes, Sipuncula, Gastrotricha, Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa, Nemertea, Phoronida, Platyhelminthes and Rotifera). These groupings are based on {{molecular}} phylogeny, which compares sections of organisms DNA and RNA. While analyses by molecular phylogeny are confident that members of Lophotrochozoa are more closely related to each other than of non-members, the relationships between members are mostly unclear.|$|E
500|$|English-language {{writings}} have conventionally treated nemertean as [...] "primitive" [...] acoelomate bilaterians {{that are}} most closely related to flatworms (Platyhelminthes). These pre-cladistics analyses emphasised as shared features: multiciliated (with multiple cilia per cell), glandular epidermis; rod-shaped secretory bodies or rhabdites; frontal glands or organs; protonephridia; and acoelomate body organization. However, multiciliated epidermal cells and epidermal gland cells are also found in Ctenophora, Echiura, Sipuncula, <b>Annelida,</b> Mollusca and other taxa. The rhabdites of nemertea have a different structure from those of flatworms at the microscopic scale. The frontal glands or organs of flatworms vary a lot in structure, and similar structures appear in small marine annelids and entoproct larvae. The protonephridia of nemertea and flatworms are different in structure, and in position – the flame cells of nemertea are usually in {{the walls of the}} fluid vessels and are served by [...] "drains" [...] from which the wastes exit by a small number of tubes through the skin, while the flame cells of flatworms are scattered throughout the body. Rigorous comparisons show no synapomorphies of nemertean and platyhelminth nephridia.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Sixty eight pine stumps felled on known {{dates from}} one to sixteen years before the moment of {{sampling}} have been studied in the San Juan de la Peña woodland (province of Hues-ca). Four microhabitats were distinguished: bark, subcortical space, sapwood and heartwood. The object {{of the study is}} to compare the invertebrate macrofauna succession of the different microhabitats in order to find regularities among them. The biocenosis has not been completely studied: ipidae, diptera and <b>annelidae</b> are the main groups not studied. The comparison has been made in terms of changes over time in the i) number of species and individuals, ii) diversity, iii) trophic structure, and iv) faunistic occupation in terms of both number of specimens and species in the different microhabitats considered. Four similar stages may be distinguid in different mi-crohabitat. These stages occur at different paces in different microhabitats. The initial situation is characterized by few species which are very abundant, big differences in the colonization inten-sity, but similar specific composition of the communities. In the intermediate situation there are more species present, but they are less abundant on average; the specific composition of the com-munities is less similar among stumps, but the colonization intensity more uniform. At the end, the number of species and specimens decreases, and there are bigger differences in the specifi...|$|R

60|$|To put {{his views}} {{into a few}} words, he conceives that all forms of life {{originally}} commenced as Monera, or simple particles of protoplasm; and that these Monera originated from not-living matter. Some of the Monera acquired tendencies towards the Protistic, others towards the Vegetal, and others towards the Animal modes of life. The last became animal Monera. Some of the animal Monera acquired a nucleus, and became amoeba-like creatures; and, out of certain of these, ciliated infusorium-like animals were developed. These became modified into two stirpes: A, that of the worms; and B, that of the sponges. The latter by progressive modification gave rise to all the Coelenterata; the former to all other animals. But A soon broke up into two principal stirpes, of which one, a, became {{the root of the}} <b>Annelida,</b> Echinodermata, and Arthropoda, while the other, b, gave rise to the Polyzoa and Ascidioida, and produced the two remaining stirpes of the Vertebrata and the Mollusca.|$|E
60|$|One natural {{consequence}} of this terrible sorrow is a long break in her correspondence. It is not {{until the beginning of}} 1841 that she seems to have resumed the thread of her life and to have returned to her literary occupations. Her health had inevitably suffered under the shock, and in the autumn of 1840 Miss Mitford speaks of not daring to expect more than a few months of lingering life. But when things were at the worst, she began unexpectedly to take a turn for the better. Through the winter she slowly gathered strength, and with strength the desire to escape from Torquay, with its dreadful associations, and to return to London. Meanwhile her correspondence with her friends revived, and with Horne in particular she was engaged during 1841 in an active interchange of views with regard to two literary projects. Indeed, it was only the return to work that enabled her to struggle against the numbing effect of the calamity which had overwhelmed her. Some time afterwards (in October 1843) she wrote to Mrs. Martin: 'For my own part and experience--I do not say it as a phrase or in exaggeration, but from very clear and positive conviction--I do believe that I should be mad at this moment, if I had not forced back--dammed out--the current of rushing recollections by work, work, work.' One of the projects in which she was concerned was 'Chaucer Modernised,' a scheme for reviving interest in the father of English poetry, suggested in the first instance by Wordsworth, but committed to the care of Horne, as editor, for execution. According to the scheme as originally planned, all the principal poets of the day were to be invited to share the task of transmuting Chaucer into modern language. Wordsworth, Leigh Hunt, Horne, and others actually executed some portions of the work; Tennyson and Browning, it was hoped, would lend a hand with some of the later parts. Horne invited Miss Barrett to contribute, and, besides executing modernisations of 'Queen <b>Annelida</b> and False Arcite' and 'The Complaint of Annelida,'[56] she also advised generally on the work of the other writers during its progress through the press. The other literary project was for a lyrical drama, to be written in collaboration with Horne. It was to be called 'Psyché Apocalypté,' and was to be a drama on the Greek model, treating of the birth and self-realisation of the soul of man.|$|E
