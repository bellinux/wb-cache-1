5|$|Many {{teachers}} at Sabha were Egyptian, {{and for the}} first time Gaddafi had access to pan-Arab newspapers and radio broadcasts, most notably the Cairo-based Voice of the Arabs. Growing up, Gaddafi witnessed significant events rock the Arab world, including the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, the Suez Crisis of 1956, and the short-lived existence of the United Arab Republic between 1958 and 1961. Gaddafi admired the political changes implemented in the <b>Arab</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Egypt</b> under his hero, President Gamal Abdel Nasser. Nasser argued for Arab nationalism; the rejection of Western colonialism, neo-colonialism, and Zionism; and a transition from capitalism to socialism. Gaddafi was influenced by Nasser's book, Philosophy of the Revolution, which outlined how to initiate a coup.|$|E
25|$|Foreign {{relations}} of the <b>Arab</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Egypt</b> are the Egyptian government's external relations with the outside world. Egypt's foreign policy operates along a non-aligned level. Factors such as population size, historical events, military strength, diplomatic expertise and a strategic geographical position give Egypt extensive political influence in the Middle East, Africa, and within the Non-Aligned Movement as a whole. Cairo has been a crossroads of the Arab world's commerce and culture for centuries, and its intellectual and Islamic institutions {{are at the center}} of the region's social and cultural landmarks.|$|E
25|$|In 1925, Egypt {{became the}} first Islamic state to legally {{recognize}} the Bahá'í Faith as an independent religion apart from Islam. Despite a historically active Egyptian Bahá'í community during the early twentieth century, Bahá'í institutions and community activities have been banned since 1960 by Law 263. This law was decreed by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, seven years after {{the founding of the}} <b>Arab</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Egypt.</b> All Bahá'í community properties, including Bahá'í centers, libraries, and cemeteries, were confiscated by the government. The current Egyptian Bahá'í community, estimated to number between several hundred and two thousand, has also had fatwas issued against it by Al-Azhar's Islamic Research Center, which charges Bahá'ís with apostasy.|$|E

It was built on an area of 12,000 square metres, with a budget of 108 000 Egyptian pounds. The building was named after the French archaeologist Gaston Maspero, who was the chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Authority.|$|R
25|$|Though Syria {{withdrew from}} the U.A.R. in 1961, Egypt {{continued}} to use the official name of the United Arab Republic until 1971, when the country was renamed officially as the <b>Arab</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Egypt.</b> In 1972, when Egypt formed the Federation of Arab Republics along with Syria, and Libya, the U.A.R. flag (whose design Syria would reuse for their own flag, eight years later) {{was replaced by a}} common flag for the Federation, once again based on the Arab Liberation flag. The two green stars in the white band were replaced by the Hawk of Qureish, which had been the coat of arms of Syria prior to the formation of the U.A.R. in 1958. The Hawk of Qureish was also adopted as the Federation's coat of arms. The shade of red used in the red band was lightened slightly.|$|E

50|$|Almost {{immediately}} however, tensions rose {{between the}} pan-Arabist Arif and Iraqi nationalist Qasim {{who also had}} the support of the Iraqi Communist Party. The former supported a union with the United <b>Arab</b> <b>Republic</b> (UAR)—composed <b>of</b> <b>Egypt</b> and Syria—under president Gamal Abdel Nasser, but the latter opposed merging with the UAR. As a result, the two leaders engaged in a power struggle, ending in Qasim prevailing and the removal of Arif from his positions on September 12. He was appointed the low-ranking post of ambassador to Bonn. Arif refused to take up the post and upon returning to Baghdad on November 4, he was promptly arrested for plotting against the state. He was sentenced to death along with Rashid Ali al-Gaylani in February 1959. Qasim had him released in November 1961.|$|R
2500|$|However, since {{a regime}} change in 1960, the Bahá'ís lost all rights as an {{organized}} religious community by Decree 263 which specified a minimum sentence of six months' imprisonment or a fine for any assembly-related activities. This law came into being seven years after the declaration of the <b>Arab</b> <b>Republic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Egypt,</b> at the decree of then-President Gamal Abdel Nasser. All Bahá'í community properties, including Bahá'í centers, libraries, and cemeteries, were confiscated by the government except the cemetery Al-Rawda Al-Abadeyya. In obedience to the government is a core principal of the religion. In 1963, Bahá'í communities were still counted in Abu Qir, Mansoura, Alexandria, Port Said, Cairo, Zeitoun, and Ismaïlia. The 1971 Egyptian constitution specified [...] "the state shall guarantee the freedom of belief and the freedom of practice of religious rites" [...] however the 1975 Egyptian Supreme Court upheld {{the legality of the}} law and ruled constitutional protections only extended to the three “heavenly” religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. From 1965 to 2001 there were 236 arrests of Baha’is, charged under Article 98(f) of the Penal Code which proscribes “disparaging contempt of any divinely-revealed religion or its adherents, or prejudicing national unity or social harmony.” Albert-Ludwig University of Freiberg’s Professor of Islamic Studies, Johanna Pink, has suggested the government was not so much concerned with the Bahá'ís being a real threat, but was attempting to “legitimise” its authority {{in the eyes of the}} people, presenting themselves as “defenders” of Egypt as an Islamic state. There were episodic waves of arrests of Bahá'ís in the mid-1960s, 1972 and 1985. In early 1987 48 Bahá'ís had sentences pronounced against them for activities as Bahá'ís. However two were found not guilty after they recanted their faith. Charges against the Bahá'ís included gathering in small groups, praying together in private homes, and being in possession of Bahá'í holy writings and prayer books. Thirty-two of the Bahá'ís were acquitted in one bunch and 13 in another by mid-1988.|$|E

50|$|In March 1955, a coup by a {{group of}} {{officers}} and two of Ahmad's brothers briefly deposed the king but was quickly suppressed. Ahmad faced growing pressures, supported by the Arab nationalism objectives <b>of</b> President <b>of</b> <b>Egypt,</b> Gamal Abdel Nasser and, in April 1956, he signed a mutual defense pact with Egypt. In 1958, Yemen joined the United <b>Arab</b> <b>Republic</b> (a federation <b>of</b> <b>Egypt</b> and Syria) in a confederation known as the United Arab States, but this confederation was dissolved soon after Syria withdrew from the United <b>Arab</b> <b>Republic</b> and the United Arab States in September 1961, and relations between Egypt and Yemen subsequently deteriorated.|$|R
25|$|Gaddafi {{followed}} {{a more radical}} policy, including support for pan-Arabism. In 1972 he proposed a Federation <b>of</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>Republics</b> consisting <b>of</b> Libya, <b>Egypt</b> and Syria, quietly abandoned in 1977. Gaddafi provided valuable assistance to emerging post-colonial African nations, but also supported terrorist attacks on western countries and Israel. The perceived danger of Gaddafi's anti-western policies and support for terrorism led to the bombing of Libya by United States forces in 1986. After Libya's involvement in the crash of Pan Am Flight 103 in Lockerbie, Scotland, and {{when it became clear}} that Libya was attempting to acquire nuclear technology, Europe and the United States imposed increasingly tight sanctions.|$|R
