As stated by Milgrom and Weber (1982, p.1095), [...] "One explanation of this inequality is that when bidders are uncertain about their valuations, they can acquire useful information by scrutinizing the bidding behavior of their competitors {{during the course of}} an <b>ascending-bid</b> <b>auction.</b> That extra information weakens the winner's curse and leads to more aggressive bidding in the <b>ascending-bid</b> <b>auction,</b> which accounts for the higher expected price." [...] The {{linkage principle}} also implies that the auctioneer maximizes the expected price by always fully revealing all information it has regarding the object being sold completely.

We compare these auction formats with a Vickrey auction and also with two ascending-bid auctions. The Vickrey auction and the alternative <b>ascending-bid</b> <b>auction</b> (Ausubel 1996) have important theoretical advantages for sellers. In a setting without private information, these auctions achieve the maximal revenue as a unique equilibrium in dominant strategies. In contrast, the pay- your-bid, uniform-price, and standard <b>ascending-bid</b> <b>auction</b> admit a multiplicity of equilibria that yield low revenues for the seller. We show how these results extend to a setting where bidders have affiliated private information. Our results question the standard ways that securities are offered to the public.

In addition, the optimal bid in <b>ascending-bid</b> <b>auctions</b> equals the value of the object, if and only if, the bidder's preferences on lotteries are both quasi-concave and quasi-convex.

40|$|In its {{attempts}} to deter and prosecute big rigging, U. S. antitrust authorities have focused on sealed-bid procurements, rather than on <b>ascending-bid</b> <b>auctions.</b> One possible justification for this focus is the idea, supported by the existing theoretical literature, that collusion creates inefficiency at sealed-bid auctions, but not at <b>ascending-bid</b> <b>auctions.</b> We show {{when there is no}} pre-auction communication and the collusive mechanism satisfies ex-post budget balance, collusion does affect efficiency. In particular, any collusive mechanism that increases cartel members' expected payoffs relative to non-cooperative play results in inefficiency either in the allocation among cartel members or in the allocation between cartel and non-cartel bidders, or both. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an <b>ascending-bid</b> <b>auction</b> in a multi-unit private value setting with increasing marginal values. This auction mechanism {{is an extension}} of the dynamic Ausubel auction, which successfully implements the efficient outcome with nonincreasing marginal values. The Ausubel auction algorithm breaks down in settings with increasing marginal values, due to the non-existence of a Walrasian equilibrium price. The proposed dynamic auction achieves efficiency in such auction environments, and like all dynamic auctions, does not require the bidders to fully express their demand curves. I use the VCG prices, inducing truthful bidding as a weakly dominant strategy. To the best of my knowledge, this is the only <b>ascending-bid</b> <b>auction</b> algorithm that achieves allocative efficiency in multi-unit auctions with increasing marginal values.

40|$|For over a century, England’s {{judicial}} system decided land disputes by ordering disputants’ legal representatives to bludgeon one another before an arena of spectating citizens. The victor won the property right for his principal. The vanquished lost his cause and, {{if he were}} unlucky, his life. People called these combats trials by battle. This paper investigates the law and economics of trial by battle. In a feudal world where high transaction costs confounded the Coase theorem, I argue that trial by battle allocated disputed property rights efficiently.

When the MBS has knowledge about the utilities and strategies of the SBSs, the proposed auction can be formulated as a Stackelberg game where the clinching bid price is obtained in closed form. Numerical results verify the theoretical analysis for different scenarios and show that the proposed auction clinches fast at the unique clinching price, thereby resulting in a win-win solution that improves the energy consumption of the HetNet...|$|E

We give conditions on the graph and buyers valuations under which the buyer and seller will both agree to such a take it or leave it offer. Specifically, the buyer-seller pair will choose private negotiation over the auction if the seller acts as a network bridge with power over the buyer and if there are enough buyers with low valuations so that the seller does not expect to receive a high price in the auction...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes an <b>ascending-bid</b> <b>auction</b> for {{efficiently}} allocating multiple complementary indivisible commodities. The seller has {{a reserve}} price for every bundle {{of goods and}} determines the quantity for sale based upon bidders ’ reported demands. The auctioneer announces a price for every bundle of goods, every bidder subsequently responds {{with a set of}} goods demanded at these prices, and then the auctioneer adjusts prices upwards for those over-demanded bundles and so on. We first show that such an auction yields an efficient allocation and a uniform market-clearing price for each bundle in finitely many steps, provided that all bidders bid sincerely or quasi-sincerely, where a quasi-sincere bidding strategy can tolerate certain inaccurate or dishonest bidding behaviors of bidders. We also propose an incentive compatible dynamic procedure for scenarios where bidders are not necessarily price-takers and may thus exercise their market power strategically. Such a dynamic procedure always induces bidders to bid sincerely and always finds an efficient allocation and a generalized Vickrey-Clarke-Groves payment for every bidder...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} auctions {{have grown in}} {{interest}} within the AI community as innovative mechanisms for resource allocation. The primary contribution {{of this paper is}} to identify a family of hybrid auctions, called survival auctions, which combine the benefits of both sealed-bid auctions (namely, quick and predictable termination time) and ascendingbid auctions (namely, more information revelation often leading, among other things, to better allocations and greater expected revenue). Survival auctions are multi-round sealed-bid auctions with an information-revelation component, in which some bidders are eliminated from the auction from one round to the next. These auctions are intuitive, easy to implement, and – most importantly – provably optimal. More precisely, we show that (a) the survival auction in which all but the lowest bidder make it into the next round (the auction lasts for (n − 1) rounds when there are n bidders) is strategically equivalent to the Japanese <b>ascending-bid</b> <b>auction,</b> which itself has been proven to be optimal in many settings, and that (b) under certain symmetry conditions, even a survival auction in which only the two highest bidders make it into the next round (the auction lasts only two rounds) is Nash outcome equivalent to the Japanese auction. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{growing number}} of auction sites on the {{internet}} enable game theorists to ask strategic questions on rationality of the observed bidding behavior. The most popular of them (eBay, Amazon. com, AuctionWatch. com and Yahoo!, etc.) operate under similar sets of rules with seemingly small differences. They implement types of <b>ascending-bid</b> <b>auctions</b> and can strategically differ from a single-round sealed-bid second-price auction. The major difference between auction formats is about their ending procedures (as described in the paper). Most of the bidding activity is observed in the final hour of the auctions. Hence, the seemingly small difference in auction ending can cause later bids in the eBay auctions than Amazon. com. In this paper, I try to investigate the evolution of bidding patterns in internet auctions. I investigate evolutionary stability of late and multiple bidding in the private-value and common-value frameworks. I use adaptive artificial agent markets in the analysis. I seek similarities between the simulation data and actual human bidding behavior. I implement discrete finite time, sequential and repeated auctions in our simulations. In this paper, I show that common- and private-value auctions can evolutionarily lead to multiple and late bidding. I observe that artificial agent late bidding is in much more frequency in eBay auctions than Amazon. com in the private-value format (i. e. computer auctions). With common values (i. e. antique auctions), expert artificial bidders bid later more frequently than naive ones. The eBay auctions stage more frequent late bidding in the eBay auctions than in Amazon. com {{when there is a}} single naive bidder. Otherwise, auctions in Amazon. com cause more late bidding. I observe that eBay auctions generate in general less average revenue for sellers. They also cause more average profit for bidders in the private-value model. For the common-value model, bidders are indifferent betIen the two formats: each can dominate the other for different number of bidders. I also test the robustness of the results under different sets of parameters. -Price Auctions, Internet Auctions, Artificial Adaptive Agents...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{allowance}} auctions are {{a component}} of existing and proposed regional cap-and-trade programs in the U. S. and are also included in recent bills in the U. S. Congress that would establish a national cap-and-trade program in the U. S. to regulate greenhouse gases (“carbon”). We discuss and evaluate the two leading candidates for the auction format for carbon allowance auctions: a uniform-price sealed-bid <b>auction</b> and an <b>ascending-bid</b> dynamic <b>auction,</b> either {{of which could be}} augmented with a “price collar ” to ensure that the price of allowances is neither too high nor too low. We identify the primary trade-offs between these auction formats as applied to carbon allowance auctions and suggest auction design choices that address potential concerns about efficiency losses from collusion and other factors. We conclude that a uniform-price sealed-bid auction is more appropriate for the sale of carbon allowances than the other leading choices, in part because it offers increased robustness to collusion without significant sacrifice in terms of price discovery. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} revenue and {{duration}} of a well-known hybrid oral auction (English auction and Dutch auction) that is extensively adopted in practice, for instance the Christie’s. Unlike sealed bid auction, oral auction is featured by its complexity of dynamic process. The bidding price varies as a stochastic time series. Therefore, the duration of oral auction {{as well as its}} revenue performs randomly. From the seller’s perspective, both the revenue and the duration are so important that extra attention and effort should be put on auction design. One of the most important issues is how to choose the starting bid price to maximize its revenue or minimize its duration. In this paper, the bidding process is decomposed into two phases: English auction (descending-bid) phase and the Dutch <b>auction</b> (<b>ascending-bid)</b> phase. For each phase, with the aid of Markov method, we derive the expected revenue and duration {{as a function of the}} starting bid. For an oral auction with a large number of bidder and each bidder behaves independently, we provide the limit results of the expected revenue and duration.
