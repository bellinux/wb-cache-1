The A380 has been purchased by several airlines using the airport, namely Malaysia Airlines, Qantas, Qatar Airways, Thai Airways, China Southern Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Etihad Airways and Emirates.

As a result, the airport was the first in Australia to be capable of handling the A380. The A380 made its first test flight into the airport on 14 November 2005. On 15 May 2008 the A380 made its first passenger flight into the airport when a Singapore Airlines Sydney-bound flight was diverted from Sydney Airport because of fog.|$|E

When dogs were {{replaced}} by horses, the greater pulling power allowed tipis to increase in size and household goods to multiply."After horses were introduced to North America, many Plains Indian tribes began to make larger horse-drawn travois. Instead of making specially constructed travois sleds, they would simply cross a pair of tepee poles across the horse's back and attach a burden platform between the poles behind the horse. This served two purposes at once, as the horses could then simultaneously carry the tepee poles and some <b>additional</b> <b>baggage.</b> Horses, of course, could pull much greater weight than dogs.

50|$|The New York and Harlem Railroad laid tracks through Tuckahoe {{during the}} mid-1840s, and {{evidence}} of a station in Tuckahoe {{can be found at}} least {{as far back as the}} 1850s. The current Tuckahoe station building was originally built in 1901, by the New York Central Railroad, and was given an <b>additional</b> <b>baggage</b> elevator approximately in 1912. The station continued to serve commuters without much change until the New York Central merged with rival Pennsylvania Railroad to form Penn Central in 1968. As Penn Central was facing bankruptcy, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority began subsidizing service in 1970, and high-level platforms were constructed to accommodate the new M1A electric MU cars being delivered at the time. Operation of the railroad continued and was passed on to Conrail in 1976. Metro-North took over direct operation in 1983.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1980s, the Laser 300 program {{became one}} of the first {{projects}} carried out cooperatively by NASA and private industry when a joint team used the Langley 12-Foot Low-Speed Tunnel to investigate the stability and control characteristics of the unusual design. Special attention was paid to behavior at high angles of attack and to stall and spin resistance. The results were unfavorable, indicating poor longitudinal stability at high angles of attack. The wing design was modified to address this problem, with an extension added to the trailing edge flap, and a discontinuous, leading edge droop added to the outboard section of the wings. Stall characteristics were found to be good, however, since the canard was found to provide a nose-down pitching moment at the point of a stall. These changes were tested on the second prototype before the design was frozen in April 1985. Additionally, production machines were to have a redesigned fuselage of round cross-section, a redesigned nose, and <b>additional</b> <b>baggage</b> compartments.|$|E
