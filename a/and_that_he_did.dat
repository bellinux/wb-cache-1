5|$|Davidson's later {{career as}} a showman earned him much notoriety but little money. His {{attempts}} at legal redress were unsuccessful, despite recognition even in church circles {{that he had not}} been fairly treated by the consistory court. After his death the case continued to attract public interest for decades, through fictional, stage and screen versions of the story. His descendants have continued to assert his innocence of any wrongdoing, and later commentators have generally accepted that however unwise and inappropriate his behaviour, his basic motives were genuine <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not deserve the humiliations he endured.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Antoniu {{wrote that}} he thought Gibbs-Smith speculated {{on the basis of}} the {{evidence}} of absence that the aircraft was never tested or flown, but that Gibbs-Smith did not find any concrete evidence to support his position. Similarly, Antoniu was unable to find concrete proof of a test flight. Antoniu also wrote that Gibbs-Smith did not check the French patents claimed by Coandă in 1910 and 1911, describing the retractable gear, leading edge wing slot and upper wing fuel tank, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not see photographs from private collections demonstrating aspects about which he wrote.|$|E
5|$|On 26 April, Babli's family filed a First Information Report (FIR) against Manoj and {{his family}} for {{kidnapping}} Babli. On 15 June, Manoj went to court with Babli, testifying that they had married in conformity with the law <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not kidnap Babli. The judge ordered police protection for the two. Chandrapati {{did not attend the}} trial so that Babli's family would not be aware that Manoj and Babli were in town.|$|E

In February 2016, an undercover reporter filmed Van der Sloot confessing to Natalee Holloway's murder. The film shows Van der Sloot, in Dutch, laughing over how he never told the truth about the whole event <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> in fact kill Natalee. His Peruvian wife is also present during this conversation.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} bill first passed the Commons, Baird {{acknowledged}} that the Conservatives might have unintentionally broken political financing laws by failing to report convention fees collected in 2005. He told a Senate committee that $1.7 million was left unreported <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not realize it was an issue at the time. The matter is under review by the Chief Electoral Officer. The Conservatives quietly tabled {{an amendment to the}} Accountability Act in November 2006, stipulating that convention fees will not be counted as political contributions.|$|E
5|$|The 1955 Dodgers {{got off to}} {{a strong}} start. Even so, an Associated Press article noted that Alston was reticent in {{response}} to questions <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not seem like a manager who had won ten consecutive games. The 1955 Brooklyn team won the pennant and its only World Series championship. They clinched the NL pennant earlier in the year than any team had in NL history. In the World Series, Alston started Johnny Podres, who had a mediocre 9-10 regular season record, in the third and seventh games; Podres won both games. The pitcher had struggled with arm problems for much of the season.|$|E

5|$|The {{charges against}} Galle were dropped before her case went to trial. Mitchell's case was tried by county {{attorney}} Scott Tidwell, a political supporter of Roberts {{and the personal}} attorney for Arafiles, in February 2010. Both the TMB executive director and the county attorney in nearby Andrews County discouraged Tidwell from trying the case. At trial, Mitchell did not testify. The relationship between Arafiles and Roberts was explored during the proceedings. Arafiles introduced Roberts to a supplement-selling program known as Zrii, and recommended the supplements to his patients. Roberts sold the supplements, {{but he said that}} his friendship with Arafiles had not impacted his actions with the nurses <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not have a business relationship with Arafiles.|$|E
5|$|The letter {{reveals that}} Gray {{felt that the}} poem was unimportant, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not expect it to become as popular or {{influential}} as it did. Gray dismisses its positives as merely being {{that he was able}} to complete the poem, which was probably influenced by his experience of the churchyard at Stoke Poges, where he attended the Sunday service and was able to visit the grave of Antrobus.|$|E
5|$|To {{resolve the}} {{possibility}} of his bigamy being exposed, Minnie pushed Brinkley to file for divorce from Sally, which he did in December 1915. To prevent the court from inquiring of Sally directly, he wrote {{that they had been}} married in New York City, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not know her current place of residence. The divorce was finalized on February 21, 1916. Four days later, Minnie and Brinkley were married again, this time in Liberty, Missouri. Brinkley had not waited the required six months from divorce to subsequent remarriage.|$|E

5|$|Apollo Justice was {{developed}} {{by a team of}} 28 staff members. It was produced by Minae Matsukawa and directed by Mitsuru Endo, with character design and art by Kazuya Nuri, while series creator Shu Takumi wrote the game's scenario and took on a supervisory role. Takumi had wanted the series to end with the previous game, as he felt its main character, Phoenix Wright, had been fully explored and that his story had been told; he said {{that it is important to}} know when to end a story, that he did not want the series to become a shadow of its former self, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not see any reason to continue it. When it was still decided that a fourth game would be made, Takumi wanted it to have a new main character and a new story; he did not plan to have Phoenix appear in the game, but his colleagues wanted him in the game in some form, which led to him being the accused in the first case in the game.|$|E
5|$|As Mulder—in Fletcher's body—is dragged {{away by the}} soldiers, Scully {{begins to}} {{question}} whether what Mulder {{told her about the}} body-swap was true. Fletcher—in Mulder's body—approaches Scully and apologizes for telling Kersh and she feigns acceptance of it. After being reprimanded, Fletcher arranges a dinner date with Scully at Mulder's apartment. Meanwhile, Mulder is confined in a cell next to the mind-switched Lana Chee. Military police arrive and take Mulder to a meeting with General Wegman, Grodin and Smoodge. They believe that Mulder-as-Fletcher was trying to defraud the FBI, not help them. Mulder bluffs his way through the meeting, and claims that the real proof is safe <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not tell them about the scheme because he did not know if he could trust his colleagues, thinking any one of them could be the source of the leak. Mulder returns to Fletcher's house and tells Joanne Fletcher that he is Agent Fox Mulder, but Joanne thinks her husband must be undergoing a mid-life crisis.|$|E
5|$|Even Larsson's {{good friend}} and biographist Georg Nordensvan joined the critics, {{but he could not}} sway Larsson's {{determination}} either, although Larsson probably took his criticism hardest. The archaeologist Bror Schnittger, who was probably identical to the anonymous writer who had initiated the criticism, launched additional criticism in Svenska Dagbladet against the lack of historical authenticity in the painting. The distance in dating between the objects in the painting were given as at least 2000 years and Schnittger thought that the painting was unacceptable in the museum building. Larsson stated that he intentionally included objects that would be from the distant past in relation to the setting of the painting, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not see these as anachronisms, because he imagined the subjects would be antiquarians who kept ancient items as ritual objects.|$|E

5|$|Free-labor proponents in the East {{also wanted}} to create a similar {{organization}} in the western states. In the 1840s members of the Salem Free Produce Association approached Coffin to see if he would be interested in managing the proposed Western Free Produce Association. At first he declined, saying he lacked the money required to fund the venture, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not want to move into the city. In 1845 a group of abolitionist businessmen opened a wholesale mercantile business in Cincinnati and the Free Produce Association raised $3,000 to help stock the new warehouse with goods. Different groups continued to pressure Coffin to accept a position as the new business's director, claiming there were no other western abolitionists qualified to manage the enterprise. Reluctantly, he finally agreed to oversee the warehouse for five years, in which time he could train someone else to run it, and in 1847 Levi and Catharine Coffin moved to Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Precautions {{were taken}} to prevent secrets from the season finale being revealed; only certain staff members were {{provided}} with copies of the episode, which were given on watermarked DVDs and distributed to secret hiding places. The writers wanted Michael {{to have a big}} plan to get Holly back, but to realize throughout {{the course of the day}} that his relationship with Holly was something special <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not want to disrupt it; they felt it showed that Michael had become more mature, calm and confident about this relationship than that of Jan Levinson and others in his past. The first scene with Michael and Holly discussing their sketch possibilities in a secluded area was filmed with three cameras: one focusing on each side of the two actors, and one from the front of both of them to establish that the picnic was still going on behind them. Due to space limitations, the latter angle was filmed through a mirror (with the actors appearing to be opposite sides) and then the image was reversed and undistorted in post-production.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{may have}} become {{involved}} in battles against the Quadi and Marcomanni immediately after the Battle of the Margus. He eventually {{made his way to}} northern Italy and made an imperial government, but it is not known whether he visited the city of Rome at this time. There is a contemporary issue of coins suggestive of an imperial adventus (arrival) for the city, but some modern historians state that Diocletian avoided the city, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> so on principle, as the city and its Senate were no longer politically relevant to the affairs of the empire and needed to be taught as much. Diocletian dated his reign from his elevation by the army, not the date of his ratification by the Senate, following the practice established by Carus, who had declared the Senate's ratification a useless formality. However, Diocletian was to offer proof of his deference towards the Senate by retaining Aristobulus as ordinary consul and colleague for 285 (one of the few instances during the Late Empire in which an emperor admitted a privatus as his colleague) and by creating senior senators Vettius Aqulinus and Junius Maximus ordinary consuls for the following year – for Maximus, it was his second consulship.|$|E

5|$|During {{the court}} case, Huseby {{stated that he}} wanted help from society and {{attention}} drawn to his cause. However, he stated that he regretted doing this by hijacking. He stated that {{all he wanted was}} {{to send a message to}} the minister of justice and prime minister that he needed help, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not intend that the other passengers be aware of his threats. Huseby stated that the hijacking was spontaneous and that he planned to make an armed robbery or take hostages at the Radisson SAS hotel in Oslo. His defence lawyer argued that Huseby did not commit a hijacking in the letter of the law, but had instead taken hostages, which would result in a lesser sentence. The court psychologists stated that Huseby had a difficult childhood, and had been defined as an alcoholic at the age of 17. They considered him to have very underdeveloped ability to make rational decisions and weak mental health. They also stated that he committed crimes to identify himself due to his low self-esteem. On 29 May 1986, Huseby was found guilty of hijacking in Eidsivating Court of Appeal. He was sentenced to three years prison and five years of preventive supervision.|$|E
5|$|For {{the fourth}} game, Takumi wrote the {{scenario}} and {{took on a}} supervisory role. He had wanted the series to end with the third game, as he felt Phoenix had been fully explored and that his story had been told; {{he said that it}} is important to know when to end a story, that he did not want the series to become a shadow of its former self, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not see any reason to continue it. Despite this, the spin-off series Ace Attorney Investigations was created, being directed by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by Motohide Eshiro; Takumi returned to the series to write the crossover Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. He also directed and wrote Dai Gyakuten Saiban, which was described as being the first entry in a new Ace Attorney series. He said that he has mixed feelings about the series being developed by other Capcom staff, comparing it to a parent sending their child to their first day in school. Yamazaki and Eshiro went on to direct and produce the main series entries Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice. Due to exhaustion after working on Dual Destinies, Yamazaki split direction responsibilities with Takuro Fuse for Spirit of Justice, with Yamazaki working on the scenario, and Fuse on the art and gameplay.|$|E
