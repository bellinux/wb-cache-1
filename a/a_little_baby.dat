500|$|Rice's {{novels are}} popular among {{many members of}} the LGBT community, some of whom have {{perceived}} her vampire characters as allegorical symbols of isolation and social alienation. Similarly, a reviewer writing for The Boston Globe observed that the vampires of her novels represent [...] "the walking alienated, those of us who, by choice or not, dwell on the fringe." [...] On the subject, Rice herself commented, [...] "From the beginning, I've had gay fans, and gay readers who felt that my works involved a sustained gay allegory ... I didn't set out to do that, but that was what they perceived. So even when Christopher was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>baby,</b> I had gay readers and gay friends and knew gay people, and lived in the Castro district of San Francisco, which was a gay neighborhood." ...|$|E
500|$|In her writing, Frank {{examined}} her {{relationships with the}} members of her family, and the strong differences in each of their personalities. She considered herself to be closest emotionally to her father, who later commented, [...] "I got on better with Anne than with Margot, who was more attached to her mother. The reason for that may have been that Margot rarely showed her feelings and didn't need as much support because she didn't suffer from mood swings as much as Anne did." [...] The Frank sisters formed a closer relationship than had existed before they went into hiding, although Anne sometimes expressed jealousy towards Margot, particularly when members of the household criticized Anne for lacking Margot's gentle and placid nature. As Anne began to mature, the sisters were able to confide in each other. In her entry of 12 January 1944, Frank wrote, [...] "Margot's much nicer... She's not nearly so catty these days and is becoming a real friend. She no longer thinks of me as <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>baby</b> who doesn't count." ...|$|E
