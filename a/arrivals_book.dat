We associate to each pattern the rating of the <b>arrival</b> <b>book</b> (0 or 1) and compute user profiles by aggregating, for each book in the user training set, the ratings of all the patterns pointing to that book. Ratings are aggregated by estimating the expected value of a Beta distribution describing the rating given to the book. Our approach allows the determination of a rating for a book, even if the book is poorly connected with user profile. It allows for a “prudent” estimation thanks to smoothing, obtained by using the Beta distribution. If many patterns are available, it considers all the contributions. Nevertheless, it allows for a lightweight computation of ratings as it exploits the knowledge encoded in the patterns. Without any setup of the system, this approach allowed us to reach a precision of 0. 60 and an overall F-measure of about 0. 52...|$|R

After a train comes out of the tunnel (after 22 minutes), it travels around the loop and stops at the terminal platform. It is then unloaded, and re-loaded with a new set of vehicles to go through the tunnel again. Once at the other end, vehicles can simply drive off of the train onto the French Autoroute or the British Motorway.

40|$|The {{following}} {{thesis is}} centred on Charles Howard, 3 rd Earl of Carlisle (1669 - 1738) {{and the life}} that he lived at Castle Howard in North Yorkshire, the country house which he built {{at the turn of}} the eighteenth century. The thesis argues that Carlisle was not isolated from social and cultural spheres whilst living in Yorkshire, a view that has been put forward by the existing historiography. Via the <b>arrival</b> of <b>books,</b> letters, and news to Castle Howard, the Earl remained connected to social and political events as well as cultural movements despite being geographically remote from London and other urban centres. In many instances, his family, close friends, and agents acted as intermediaries, sourcing, recommending, and sending north all types of textual material. The Earl’s participation in epistolary, news, and book exchange networks – at regional and national levels – meant Castle Howard was an active site of textual exchange and engagement in the first four decades of the eighteenth century. Such a reading challenges, more generally, the traditional interpretation that country house residents were disconnected from the nation’s Capital as well as the local communities that they neighboured. ...|$|R

The Czech printing production related to the efforts of reformation to further enhance the moral status of the society soon turned to disseminating literature in the vernacular, yet often they were translated literature. The early Czech printed production however was affected by low quality and quantity of prints and was not of the significance declared by the previous generations of researchers. Personalities of the Catholic society were more inclusive about new ideas from abroad. In the contemporary society the Catholics were therefore the first ones to embrace book printing and also they were quicker in reception of humanism.

40|$|In his 1975 novel, Topographie idéale pour une agression caractérisée [Ideal Topography for an Aggravated Assault], Algerian novelist Rachid Boudjedra {{reminds us}} that {{disorientation}} is a fascinating but life-threatening experience. His main protagonist, a Berber migrant newly arrived from his village, is lost in the Parisian metro. Boudjedra's attempt at writing {{from the perspective of}} the disoriented traveller disrupts generic conventions and confronts his readers with an unreadable textual labyrinth that exhausts and confuses us. Disorientation in and by a novel forces us to find answers to such questions as: How do we know we have arrived somewhere or that we belong? What does the representation of a disoriented subject teach us about the (reading) skills we need to integrate into a foreign place/culture? Is integration a form of violent reorientation? Boudjedra tempts us, dares us, to give up and abandon the book and the migrant to his fate (in the book, he is murdered) but also encourages us to think about an alternative practice of ‘accompaniment’. He invites us to consider what happens to the idea of integration if we cannot conceptualise <b>arrival.</b> His <b>book</b> exposes the invisible violence experienced by the migrant who is expected to reorient him or herself, and suggests that we might see accompaniment as a two-way integration that requires a permanent, mutual and disorienting process of differed arrival...|$|R

Using an intensity framework allows to estimate the simultaneous buy and sell intensity and to derive a continuous-time measure for the buy-sell pressure in the market.

We find evidence for the hypothesis that traders use order book information in order to infer from the price setting behavior of market participants.
