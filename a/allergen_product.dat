40|$|Fatal {{reactions}} {{related to}} subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy are rare: one event in 2. 5 million injections {{has been reported}} in the USA and none in Europe. The prevalence of very severe systemic reactions (systemic adverse events [SAEs]) is one in 1 million injections. Though the serious events rate is decreasing and the majority of SAEs (∼ 0. 2 % per injection) are moderate and reversible, they still represent a major concern. Uncontrolled asthma, long-term therapy with β-blockers and high degree of allergen sensitivity are generally considered risk factors. The relevance of other conditions, like previous local reactions, the use of extracts conjugated with adjuvants and accelerated build-up schedules is controversial, as well as the role of preventative strategies. A careful risk assessment of patients and optimal administration procedures may significantly decrease the risk of SAEs. However, more uniform safety data are required and an accurate safety profile should be provided for every <b>allergen</b> <b>product...</b>|$|E

The full-length cDNA comprised 441 nucleotides and was 99. 3 % {{identical to the}} reference sequence (GenBank AB 195580). The cDNA was bound to vector pET 28 a to construct plasmid pET 28 a(+) -Der f 2, which was transformed into E. coli BL 21 and induced by IPTG. SDS-PAGE showed a specific band of about 14 kDa in the hole cell lysate. s estiated by chroatography, about 3. 86 g of the recobinant product as obtained, which conjugated with serum IgE from asthmatic children. The protein had a signal peptide of 17 amino acids. Its secondary structure comprised an alpha helix (19. 86 %), an extended strand (30. 82 %), and a random coil (49. 32 %). The subcellular localization of this allergen was predicted to be at mitochondria. Furthermore, its function was shown {{to be associated with}} an MD- 2 -related lipid-recognition (ML) domain.

40|$|Regulatory {{approaches}} for <b>allergen</b> immunotherapy (AIT) <b>products</b> {{and the availability}} of high quality AIT products are inherently linked to each other. While <b>allergen</b> <b>products</b> are available in many countries across the globe, their regulation is very heterogeneous. First, we describe the regulatory systems applicable for AIT products in the European Union (EU) and in the United States (US). For Europe, a depiction of the different types of relevant procedures, as well as the committees involved is provided and the fundamental role of national agencies of the EU member states in this complex and unique network is highlighted. Furthermore, the regulatory agencies from Australia, Canada, Japan, Russia, and Switzerland provided information on the system implemented in their countries for the regulation of <b>allergen</b> <b>products.</b> While AIT products are commonly classified as biological medicinal products, they are made available by varying types of procedures, most commonly by either obtaining a marketing authorisation or by being distributed as named patient products. Exemptions from marketing authorisations in exceptional cases, as well as import of <b>allergen</b> <b>products</b> from other countries, are additional tools applied by countries to ensure availability of needed AIT products. Several challenges for AIT products are apparent from this analysis and will require further consideration. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserve...|$|R
40|$|The BSP 090 project aims at {{establishing}} European Pharmacopoeia Reference Substances {{in combination}} with the corresponding ELISA methods for the quantification of major <b>allergens</b> in <b>allergen</b> <b>products.</b> Two sandwich ELISAs proved suitable for quantification of Bet v 1, the major birch pollen allergen, in preceding phases of BSP 090. Two Bet v 1 -specific ELISA systems were compared with respect to accuracy and precision in a ring trial including 13 laboratories. Model samples containing recombinant rBet v 1. 0101 as well as native birch pollen extracts were measured independently at least three times in each facility. The assessment was completed with a comparative quantification of Bet v 1 in 30 marketed birch <b>allergen</b> <b>products</b> in one laboratory, simulating the future use as reference method. In the collaborative study, both candidate ELISAs confirmed their suitability to quantify recombinant and native Bet v 1. ELISA-A showed higher precision and lower interlaboratory variability, yet ELISA-B exhibited slightly higher accuracy. Subsequent parallel measurement of Bet v 1 in a panel of 'real-life' birch <b>allergen</b> <b>products</b> indicated better repeatability of ELISA-B. Both systems detected substantial differences in Bet v 1 content between <b>allergen</b> <b>products,</b> but the effect was more pronounced using ELISA-B due to persistently higher values compared to ELISA-A.

40|$|Adequate {{quality is}} {{essential}} for any medicinal product {{to be eligible for}} marketing. Quality includes verification of the identity, content and purity of a medicinal product in combination with a specified production process and its control. <b>Allergen</b> <b>products</b> derived from natural sources require particular considerations to ensure adequate quality. Here, we describe key aspects of the documentation on manufacturing and quality aspects for <b>allergen</b> immunotherapy <b>products</b> in the European Union and the United States. In some key parts, requirements in these areas are harmonized while other fields are regulated separately between both regions. Essential differences are found in the use of Reference Preparations, or the requirement to apply standardized assays for potency determination. Since the types of products available are different in specific regions, regulatory guidance for such products may also be available in one specific region only, such as for allergoids in the European Union. Region-specific issues and priorities are a result of this. As <b>allergen</b> <b>products</b> derived from natural sources are inherently variable in their qualitative and quantitative composition, these products present special challenges to balance the variability and ensuring batch-to-batch consistency. Advancements in scientific knowledge on specific allergens and their role in allergic disease will consequentially find representation in future regulatory guidelines.

40|$|Food {{trends are}} {{evolving}} {{in many ways}} {{and one of the}} biggest upcoming trends is the free-from diet, which represents <b>products</b> free from <b>allergen</b> ingredients such as gluten, lactose, etc. The trend has reached individuals with food intolerances as well as people with a health conscious mind who believe this being a healthier way of living. In general, the amount of individuals who are starting {{to be aware of the}} free-from term and concept is constantly increasing. The purpose of this master thesis is to evaluate the current adaptation of <b>allergen</b> free <b>products</b> among Swedish bakeries and patisseries from a marketing perspective. The identified problem in the field is the lack of information concerning how bakeries and patisseries are marketing the <b>allergen</b> free <b>products.</b> The literature review presents different food trends and definitions based on current literature as a conceptual basis for the analysis. In order to answer the research question, a quantitative method in form of a survey was used. There were 38 companies who participated in the survey and the results show that the majority does not market the <b>allergen</b> free <b>products</b> in a different way compared to regular products and that competition within this market is experienced to be rather low. In the analysis, the results are divided into companies with and without <b>allergen</b> free <b>products.</b> This Master‟s Thesis concludes that bakeries and patisseries in Sweden have successfully introduced <b>allergen</b> free <b>products</b> to the market, but they need to set a deeper focus on the free-from marketing of such products in order to survive future competition. Moreover, marketing implications are formulated for the Swedish bakery Swebake AB, which is the cooperation company for this thesis.

40|$|Allergy against birch pollen {{is among}} the most common causes of spring pollinosis in Europe and is {{diagnosed}} and treated using extracts from natural sources. Quality control is crucial for safe and effective diagnosis and treatment. However, current methods are very difficult to standardize and do not address individual allergen or isoallergen composition. MS provides information regarding selected proteins or the entire proteome and could overcome the aforementioned limitations. We studied the proteome of birch pollen, focusing on allergens and isoallergens, to clarify which of the 93 published sequence variants of the major allergen, Bet v 1, are expressed as proteins within one source material in parallel. The unexpectedly complex Bet v 1 isoallergen composition required manual data interpretation and a specific design of databases, as current database search engines fail to unambiguously assign spectra to highly homologous, partially identical proteins. We identified 47 non-allergenic proteins and all 5 known birch pollen allergens, and unambiguously proved the existence of 18 Bet v 1 isoallergens and variants by manual data analysis.

40|$|Separation and {{characterization}} of nitrated variants {{of the major}} birch pollen allergen by CZE-ESI-TOF MS A CZE-ESI-TOF MS method has been optimized for the separation and identification of nitrated variants of the major birch pollen allergen from Betula verrucosa, isoform 1 a (Bet v 1 a). In-house nitration of recombinant Bet v 1 a was done by peroxynitrite. As a BGE, 10 mmol/L ammonium bicarbonate with pH 7. 50 provided best resolution. Nebulizer gas pressure and sheath liquid flow rate of 0. 4 bar and 6 L/min, respectively, maintained CZE selectivity and constituted stable electrospray conditions. A sheath liquid composition of 75 % v/v methanol with 0. 1 % v/v formic acid in ultrapure water resulted in highest signal intensities. Alternatively, methanol could be replaced by 50 % v/v isopropanol. Two modified <b>allergen</b> <b>products</b> derived from reaction mixtures that contained different amounts of the nitration reagent were compared by the elaborated CZE-ESI-TOF MS method. Up to twelve different Bet v 1 a variants with one- to sixfold nitration could be distinguished. Several allergen fractions of equivalent nitration grade were resolved. Their different migration times indicate site-specific nitration with concomitant differences in pI and maybe also in hydrodynamic radius.

This study aimed to create a skin prick test reagent of crab myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic proteins to improve sensitivity and specificity diagnosis of allergy. Myofibrillar protein fraction was composed of 19 protein bands with the molecular weights of 9. 6 - 111. 6 kDa and sarcoplasmic protein fraction was composed of 19 protein bands with the molecular weights of 9. 5 - 104. 6 kDa. The allergenic myofibrillar protein has the molecular weights of 13. 9 - 155. 4 kDa while the allergenic sarcoplasmic protein has the molecular weights of 8. 4 - 129. 4 kDa. Crab myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic reagents met {{the requirements of the}} European Pharmacopoeia Monograph on <b>Allergen</b> <b>Products</b> 7 (2010 : 1063) for the parameters of moisture content, protein content, sterility and microbiology.

This study aimed at the development of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) sandwich ELISA for Ole e 1. Balb/c mice immunized with Ole e 1 were used for the production of mAbs. Screening of mice and hybridomas was performed in a RIA with radiolabeled purified Ole e 1. Purified mAbs were used as catching and/or (biotinylated) detecting antibodies in sandwich ELISA. Four mAbs (IgG 1 kappa) directed to nonoverlapping epitopes on Ole e 1 were obtained: 1 A 12, 5 C 1, 10 A 12 and 3 H 8. Both 1 A 12 and 10 A 12 were successfully used for affinity purification of Ole e 1 from olive pollen extract. Two sandwich ELISAs were developed, with 1 A 12 and 10 A 12 as catching, and 5 C 1 and 3 H 8 as detecting antibodies, respectively. Both catching and detecting antibodies were used in similar concentrations, ranging from 60 to 100 ng/well. For both ELISAs, the sensitivity was approximately 1 ng/ml of Ole e 1. The measuring range was from 1 to 25 ng/ml. No significant differences were observed, when the performance of both ELISAs in standardization of olive pollen extracts was compared.

The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify specific latex allergens in latex devices used in South African academic dental schools. The current study also compared the total protein content and the levels of specific <b>allergens</b> in these <b>products.</b> METHODS: Fourteen latex examination gloves (powdered and non-powdered) and five dental rubber dams, representing 6 brands, from five dental academic institutions were analysed for latex allergens and total protein. Total protein content was determined using the BioRad DC protein assay kit and natural rubber allergen levels using a capture enyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) specific for Hev b 1, Hev b 3, Hev b 5 and Hev b 6. 02. RESULTS: Hev b 6. 02 was found in higher concentrations than other natural rubber latex (NRL) <b>allergens</b> in the <b>products</b> analysed. Hev b 5 content ranged from 0 to 9. 2 microg/g and Hev b 6. 02 from 0. 09 to 61. 5 microg/g of sample. Hev b 1 levels were below the detection limit (DL) for 79 % of the samples (15 / 19). Dental dams showed higher allergen levels (median 80. 91 microg/g) than latex gloves (median 11. 34 microg/g). Powdered rubber samples also showed higher allergen levels (median 40. 54 microg/g) than non-powdered samples (median 5. 31 microg/g).

40|$|In {{patients}} with allergic rhinitis (AR), the nasal provocation test (NPT) {{is the standard}} procedure to evaluate the clinical response of the nasal mucosa to allergens with a high specificity and sensitivity. In AR, {{it is the only}} test that really measures the response of the diseased mucosa to allergens while skin prick test and serum IgE confirm the clinical suspicion of sensitization. Moreover, it is of special relevance in the detection of {{patients with}} Local Allergic Rhinitis (LAR), where general sensitization cannot be measured. For the evaluation of therapeutic interventions, NPT has been used for the clinical monitoring of antiallergic drugs and allergen specific immunotherapy. Legislation within the European Union (EU) defines allergens used for diagnostic tests like NPT to be medicinal products according to Directive 2001 / 83 EC, but national law is considering these products to be medicinal devices in a number of EU countries. Thus, NPT products are governed by different legislations and therefore standards throughout the EU. In consequence, allergens used for diagnostic purposes need different registrations and Marketing Authorization by national authorities. After a transition period, regulations of EU Directives are to be implemented in national law by all member states. At the moment, most EU countries have not fully implemented these Directives, however, it can be expected that most countries will implement it and enforce their rules within the next years. This development has a tremendous impact on the availability of diagnostic allergens for NPT in Europe and will make make nasal provocation testing very difficult if not impossible.

Recently, purified major allergens have been obtained by recombinant DNA technology and produced under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) conditions. In principle, such recombinant allergens could be established as reference standards and could help for the standardisation of the major allergen content of allergen extracts. Two recombinant major allergens, one from birch pollen, rBet v 1, and one from Timothy grass pollen, Phl p 5 a, have been selected {{at the end of the}} CREATE programme as a potential starting point for the establishment as European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) Reference Standards through a project run by the Biological Standardisation Programme (BSP) of the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & HealthCare (EDQM). To this end, bulk candidate recombinant materials, produced under GMP conditions, were procured from two European manufacturers and subsequently formulated and lyophilised. Four ELISA systems from three different manufacturers were included in the project, two for Bet v 1 and two for Phl p 5 a with the aim of establishing reference methods for determination of the respective major antigens both in natural allergen extracts as well as in recombinant <b>allergen</b> <b>products.</b> The project was run in 3 phases: a preparatory and preliminary testing phase (feasibility phase or Phase 1), an extended feasibility phase carried out in 3 laboratories (Phase 2) to confirm the transferability of the methods and an international collaborative study with a large number of participating laboratories (Phase 3).

However, they acknowledged that hypoallergenic foods had the potential to improve the quality of lives of food allergy sufferers through increasing dietary variation and reducing restrictions on product selection. Stakeholders supported the introduction of novel foods (although this support was not universal), assuming that the products were acceptable to food allergic consumers, consumers in general and regulators. Originality/value – The paper is likely to be useful for the potential developers of hypoallergenic foods, <b>allergen</b> food <b>products</b> (food industry and scientists) and policy makers regarding the commercialisation of novel hypoallergenic foods and their regulatio...|$|R

40|$|Food allergy {{constitutes}} an important health problem which is recognized by food producers, consumers and regulatory bodies. The current {{efforts to protect}} individuals sensitized to food allergens largely relies on a strategy of avoidance of the offending food. In order to support this, sensitive analytical methods with a high selectivity are required {{for the detection of}} traces of all major food <b>allergens</b> in food <b>products.</b> In this chapter we have listed the methods that are currently in use for this purpose, and we have described 5 major food allergens and the analytical methods that are employed for their detection.

40|$|Abstract: We have {{established}} a highly sensitive sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on two monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to measure {{the content of the}} major peanut allergen Ara h 1 in foods. Two mAbs were selected out of 12 murine hybridoma cells secreting Ara h 1 -specific antibody. Using mAb 6 as the capture antibody and HRP-labelled mAb 4 as the detection antibody, the limit of detection (LOD) the assay was 0. 34 ng/mL. Cross-reaction analysis showed that this method was strongly specific and had no cross-reactions with Ara h 2, pea protein or soy protein. Sample analysis showed that this ELISA was a useful tool to monitor peanut <b>allergens</b> in food <b>products</b> by measuring Ara h 1 content...|$|R
50|$|Australia and New Zealand have a joint {{standards}} {{body for}} food safety: Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ).It {{is an independent}} statutory agency established by the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act 1991. FSANZ {{is part of the}} Australian Government's Health portfolio.FSANZ develops standards that regulate the use of ingredients, processing aids, colourings, additives, vitamins and minerals. Their standards also includes the composition of some foods, e.g. dairy, meat and beverages as well as standards developed by new technologies such as genetically modified foods. FSANZ is also responsible for some labelling requirements for packaged and unpackaged food, e.g. specific mandatory warnings or advisory labels. FSANZ must ensure that labelling of packaged foods includes: name and description of the product, mandatory warning and advisory statements, ingredient list, date marking, nutrition information panel, percentage labelling, directions for storage and use.Another main role of FSANZ is to manage food recall systems. When a product is declared to have safety issues like harmful bacteria or the presence of <b>allergens</b> the <b>products</b> needs to be removed from retail shelves and people's homes to ensure {{the health and safety of}} consumers.|$|R
