500|$|Ball {{began writing}} American Beauty as a {{play in the}} early 1990s, partly {{inspired}} by the media circus around the <b>Amy</b> <b>Fisher</b> trial in 1992. He shelved the play after realizing the story would not work on stage. After several years as a television screenwriter, Ball revived the idea in 1997 when attempting {{to break into the}} film industry. The modified script had a cynical outlook that was influenced by Ball's frustrating tenures writing for several sitcoms. Producers Dan Jinks and Bruce Cohen took American Beauty to DreamWorks; the then-fledgling film studio bought Ball's script for $250,000, outbidding several other production bodies. DreamWorks financed the $15million production and served as its North American distributor. American Beauty marked acclaimed theater director Mendes' film debut; courted after his successful productions of the musicals Oliver! and Cabaret, Mendes was, nevertheless, only given the job after 20 others were considered and several [...] "A-list" [...] directors turned down the opportunity.|$|E
500|$|Ball {{was partly}} {{inspired}} by two encounters {{he had in}} the early 1990s. In about 1991–92, Ball saw a plastic bag blowing in the wind outside the World Trade Center. He watched the bag for 10 minutes, saying later that it provoked an [...] "unexpected emotional response". In 1992, Ball became preoccupied with the media circus around the <b>Amy</b> <b>Fisher</b> trial. Discovering a comic book telling of the scandal, he was struck by how quickly it had become commercialized. He said he [...] "felt like there was a real story underneath [...] more fascinating and way more tragic" [...] than the story presented to the public, and attempted to turn the idea into a play. Ball produced around 40 pages, but stopped when he realized it would work better as a film. He felt that because of the visual themes, and because each character's story was [...] "intensely personal", it could not be done on a stage. All the main characters appeared in this version, but Carolyn did not feature strongly; Jim and Jim instead had much larger roles.|$|E

2500|$|On January 12, 2009, Fisher {{released}} a pay-per-view adult film titled Amy Fisher: Totally Nude & Exposed. Fisher {{signed a deal}} with Lee Entertainment to become a stripper doing club shows {{at least once a}} month. Fisher claimed she planned to strip till her fans told her, [...] "Dear, please put your clothes back on. You're too old." [...] In September 2010, DreamZone Entertainment released the adult film Deep Inside <b>Amy</b> <b>Fisher,</b> calling it the first of eight such films Fisher would produce and in which she would star. The company had announced the movie in July 2010 under the working title The Making of Amy Fisher: Porn Star. In June 2011, Fisher said she was no longer making adult films.|$|E
2500|$|Although Milano {{feared that}} viewers would only {{recognize}} her as [...] "the girl from Who's the Boss?", she was noticed by the media, which helped her land {{the role of}} <b>Amy</b> <b>Fisher</b> in the high-profile TV movie Casualties of Love: The Long Island Lolita Story, one of three TV films based on Fisher's shooting of Mary Jo Buttafuoco. Milano said that her portrayal of Fisher in the film, {{which was based on}} the Buttafuoco's point of view, [...] "was the least 'Alyssa' of anything [...] done." [...] The film was shot from November - December 1992. She welcomed the cancellation of the series, as she was ready to move on to other roles and enthusiastic to [...] "showcase" [...] what she was able to do. Looking back on eight years of playing the same role, Milano commented, [...] "Creatively, it's been very frustrating. I gave her more of a personality. I changed her wardrobe, cut her hair, anything to give her new life." ...|$|E
