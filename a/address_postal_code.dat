30|$|Catastrophe {{modeling}} has conventionally {{been designed}} as a probabilistic model that estimates losses based on risk and vulnerability of exposure units for a foreseeable set of events. Factors affecting the estimates of losses of an exposure unit include site location, physical characteristics, and the financial terms of insurance coverage. Site locations are denoted as geocoding data such as street <b>address,</b> <b>postal</b> <b>code,</b> and country/CRESTA (Catastrophe Risk Evaluating and Standardizing Target Accumulations) zone. Physical characteristics describe the construction, occupancy status, year built, and number of stories of the building. Financial terms refer to the value, limit, and deductible of the coverage. In the case of earthquakes, a probable earthquake magnitude is simulated based on a catalogue of historical records of earthquakes within the region of concern. The {{next step is to}} estimate the Modified Mercalli Scale Intensities (MMI) of the region according to the distance from the quake’s epicenter, the focal depth and magnitude of the earthquake, and the geological structures at the location. Often these factors are accounted for with empirical attenuation equations for each geological structure. Different attenuation equations for each geological structure are needed to consider their differences in seismic wave propagation characteristics. Softer sediment would tend to amplify shaking, but would affect a smaller radius to the epicenter. Hard sediments or rocks experience lower shaking intensity, but the shaking can be felt at much larger distances from the epicenter. The MMI is thereafter correlated to the building physical characteristics and financial terms to estimate the damage losses. Different building physical characteristics yield different sets of vulnerability curves. This methodology is highly suitable for quantifying losses over a wide area or for portfolios with large number of buildings. Precise building damage estimation is often not the prime concern.|$|E

This is a large improvement over naive approaches such as ordering according to regressed scores, which has a regret transform of r → nr where n is the number of elements. ...|$|R

This tree dependent identically distributed or tdid assumption preserves exchangeability and naturally generalizes iid assumptions. Each datum is sampled sequentially after being conditioned on an unknown parent. The resulting tdid likelihood of data is the determinant of a Laplacian of pairwise conditional distributions evaluations. Variants of tdid likelihood cover undirected and directed trees and can also reduce to iid likelihood (a simple product) when conditionals become independent. These build upon the graph Laplacian, a sufficient statistic that captures a distribution over tree structures for improved inference over standard point-estimates of structure. The tdid assumption leads to novel maximum likelihood estimators and inference methods. ...|$|R
