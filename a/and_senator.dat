Kennedy introduced a bipartisan bill in August 1970 for single-payer universal national health insurance with no cost sharing, paid for by payroll taxes and general federal revenue.|$|E

He hired a professional campaign manager, Murray Chotiner, who had helped to run successful campaigns for both Governor Warren <b>and</b> <b>Senator</b> Knowland and had played a limited role in Nixon's first congressional race.|$|E
