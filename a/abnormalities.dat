40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intractable {{epilepsy}} is a well-recognized complication follow-ing head trauma, {{and many}} factors have been implicated in its pathogenesis. This study was performed to determine the severity of tissue damage after severe head injury as assessed with magnetization transfer (MT) MR imaging {{and the relationship of}} this damage with seizure intractability. METHODS: Forty-four patients, 13 without seizures (disease controls) and 31 with seizures, underwent T 1 -weighted MT MR imaging 1 – 10 years after head trauma. Phase-corrected gradient-echo (GRE) imaging was also performed in all patients to look for the presence of hemosiderin. All patients were evaluated for the presence of an MT <b>abnormality</b> beyond an <b>abnormality</b> seen on T 2 -weighted images, an MT <b>abnormality</b> within a T 2 <b>abnormality,</b> and hemosiderin deposition. RESULTS: Patients with an MT <b>abnormality</b> beyond a T 2 <b>abnormality</b> had a significantly higher intractability of seizures compared with those with an MT <b>abnormality</b> within a T 2 <b>abnormality</b> (P <. 05). In addition, the mere presence of hemosiderin deposit was not associated with seizure intractability; however, gliosis around the hemosiderin as seen on T 1 -weighted MT images was associated with seizure intractability...|$|R

A tremor or dystonia may indicate a neurological condition or the side effects of antipsychotic medication. The patient may have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful movements or vocalizations) which may be a symptom of Tourette's syndrome. There are a range of <b>abnormalities</b> of movement which are typical of catatonia, such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or gegenhalten). Stereotypies (repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (repetitive quasi-purposeful abnormal movements such as a gesture or abnormal gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.|$|E

5|$|Lameness in horses is {{movement}} at an abnormal gait due to pain in {{any part of}} the body. It is frequently caused by pain to the shoulders, hips, legs or feet. Lameness can also be caused by <b>abnormalities</b> in the digestive, circulatory and nervous systems. While horses with poor conformation and congenital conditions are more likely to develop lameness, trauma, infection and acquired <b>abnormalities</b> are also causes. The largest cause of poor performance in equine athletes is lameness caused by <b>abnormalities</b> in the muscular or skeletal systems. The majority of lameness is found in the forelimbs, with at least 95 percent of these cases stemming from problems in the structures from the knee down. Lameness in the hind limbs is caused by problems in the hock and/or stifle 80 percent of the time.|$|E

40|$|UnrestrictedDenial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed DoS (DDoS) attacks {{can cause}} {{serious problem in}} {{wireless}} networks due to its limited network/host resources. Attacker traceback is a promising solution to take a proper countermeasure near the attack origin, for forensics and to discourage attacker from launching attacks. However, attacker traceback in wireless multi-hop networks is a challenging problem and existing IP traceback schemes developed for the Internet cannot be directly applied to wireless multi-hop networks due to the peculiar characteristics of wireless multi-hop networks, i. e., dynamic network topology, limited network resources, and mobility. We introduce a protocol framework for attacker traceback that is geared towards wireless multi-hop networks, robust against address spoofing and node compromise, and node mobility. The basic building block of our protocol framework consists of <b>abnormality</b> characterization, <b>abnormality</b> searching, and <b>abnormality</b> matching. <b>Abnormality</b> characterization is further divided into network-layer <b>abnormality</b> monitoring, MAC-layer <b>abnormality</b> monitoring, and hybrid <b>abnormality</b> monitoring. For efficient <b>abnormality</b> searching, we propose directional searching {{that is based on}} small-world model. We use correlation coefficient, least-square method, and K-S fitness test for <b>abnormality</b> matching. In addition, our protocol framework includes spatio-temporal fusion architecture to detect mobile attack. Traceback of mobile attack is a challenging problem that we identified and solved in this dissertation. In mobile wireless multi-hop networks, it is important to detect and track down mobile attackers to prevent false traceabck result and find current location of attacker. It is especially challenging in the context of mobile DDoS attack. Lastly, we analyze how mobility model affects the traceback performance. We find that traceback performance drastically varies depending on the mobility model.; We show that our hybrid protocol successfully tracks down attacker under diverse network environment (e. g., high background traffic, DDoS attack, and partial node compromise) with low communication, computation, and memory overhead...|$|R
