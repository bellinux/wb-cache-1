500|$|Aaron Ashmore plays Jimmy Olsen, Chloe's {{photographer}} boyfriend {{who works}} at the Daily Planet. Ashmore, a recurring guest in season six, became a regular cast member in season seven. He called his casting a welcome surprise: [...] "I auditioned for [...] and I put myself on tape. I hadn't heard anything, and a couple of weeks later, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> (sic), I got the call saying, 'You're going to Vancouver to start shooting Smallville.' It's a dream come true, really." [...] After three seasons on the series (two as a regular), Ashmore's character was killed off. Although Ashmore's Jimmy Olsen was murdered, he said his character was not the [...] "real" [...] Jimmy Olsen, his real name revealed to be Henry James Olsen. Jimmy's younger brother, who appears briefly in the season-eight finale, is intended to be the Jimmy who works with Clark and Lois. Ashmore returns as the younger Jimmy in the series finale.|$|E
500|$|The lyrical themes on {{the album}} deal with issues of spirituality, morality, and self-examination. Vedder said, [...] "I think there's a little self-examination in those songs, {{something}} {{that a lot of}} my friends are going through too, as they approach 30." [...] Ament said, [...] "In some ways, it's like the band's story. It's about growing up." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Hail, Hail" [...] refer to two people in a troubled relationship struggling to hold it together. Vedder has said that he wrote the song [...] "Off He Goes" [...] about himself and how he is a [...] "shit friend," [...] adding, [...] "I'll show up and everything's great and then <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> I'm outta there..." [...] "Lukin" [...] is about the [...] "pretty intense stalker problem," [...] Vedder faced during the mid-1990s. [...] "Around the Bend" [...] was written by Vedder as a lullaby that Irons could sing to his son.|$|E
500|$|By September 2015, John Paesano {{had begun}} {{composing}} {{music for the}} season. He felt that the season's new showrunners [...] "were true to {{what we were trying}} to do in season one. There were just elements in season two that we had to acknowledge" [...] such as the Punisher and Elektra. He jokingly said that [...] "it’s not like we <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> went into John Williams territory, you know? It’s definitely still dark, still gritty ... but it definitely jumps up a couple levels." [...] When approaching the characters of Punisher and Elektra, with whom Paesano was familiar from the comics and previous adaptations, he [...] "took all those preconceived notions I had with a grain of salt" [...] and waited to see what the season's interpretation of the characters would be. Paesano worked closely with the series' sound design team, spotting episodes with them to coordinate where [...] "we were going to hit what" [...] and [...] "maintain that definable aspect of New York" [...] and its sound. A soundtrack album for the season was released digitally by Hollywood Records on July 15, 2016.|$|E

500|$|... "Spit & Eggs" [...] {{features}} {{the return of}} series regular Tina Majorino, who plays Mac on the show, after an absence of six episodes. Majorino had not appeared since the second episode of the season, [...] "My Big Fat Greek Rush Week". At the time, Majorino was also a series regular on the HBO series Big Love, so her schedule was difficult to determine. She stated: [...] "It's a little tough, but Big Love and Veronica Mars have both been really great about juggling the schedule so I could do both shows." [...] On October 24, 2006, {{the cast and crew}} were filming the episode. Because of this other commitment, Majorino appeared in eleven episodes of the season instead of the scheduled twelve. On that same date, Majorino revealed that she would be returning in [...] "Spit & Eggs", that it resolved the Hearst rapist storyline, and that it would introduce the show's next major story arc. On her role in the episode and in the season as a whole in light of the events in the second season finale, Majorino commented, [...] "It's not like <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> she's over everything that happened." ...|$|E
500|$|Ashmore {{indicates}} that his casting {{was both a}} surprise and what he wanted. The actor states, [...] "I auditioned for [...] and I put myself on tape. I hadn't heard anything, {{and a couple of}} weeks later, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden,</b> I got the call saying, 'You're going to Vancouver to start shooting Smallville.' It's a dream come true, really." [...] Aaron Ashmore's twin, Shawn, who is better known as Bobby [...] "Iceman" [...] Drake in the X-Men film series, appeared in two episodes of Smallville as the power leeching Eric Summers. After three seasons with the show, two as a series regular, Ashmore was written out of the series. According to Ashmore, when the producers were first trying to get permission to use the character on Smallville, DC Comics had qualms over how close Jimmy was in age to Clark and Lois, as the character was supposed to be at least ten years younger. The producers guaranteed the department they would eventually reveal the Jimmy Olsen who appeared on the show was not the Jimmy Olsen who would one day work alongside Clark and Lois. At the character's funeral, his full name is shown to be [...] "Henry James Olsen", and it is alluded that Jimmy's younger brother, who is given a brief appearance at the funeral, is the DC Comics version of Jimmy Olsen who will one day work at the Daily Planet with Clark and Lois. Although Ashmore was sad to leave the show, he feels that the redemptive story that was given to Jimmy in the finale, through the self-sacrifice he makes for Chloe, makes a good send off for his character.|$|E

2500|$|After the game, Allen {{was cited}} {{as one of}} the main reasons for Duke's {{comeback}} and win by commentators. Mike Krzyzewski agreed, saying, [...] "We were kind of dead in the water. We were nine points down and Grayson just put us on his back." [...] Commenting on his team's loss, Bo Ryan credited Duke's physical defense saying [...] "There was more body contact in this game than any game we played all year, and I just feel sorry for my guys that <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> a game was like that, and I think they're struggling with that a little bit." [...] Ryan, however, also blamed the officials, citing the disparity in fouls called during the second half (Wisconsin's 13 to Duke's 6) and the controversial replay review near the end of the game.|$|E

Michael Weatherly and Cote de Pablo both point to [...] "Under Covers", the eighth episode of that season, as the catalyst for the flirtation between the characters. The episode involves Tony and Ziva being sent undercover as a married couple, an assignment that requires them to simulate sexual relations in order to solidify their cover. De Pablo commented, [...] "Michael and I talked about all of those scenes right before we did them. We had a totally different way of looking at it. In our minds, we thought the characters weren't faking anything. They just got carried away. Then <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> after that, they saw each other in a different light."

2500|$|On {{returning}} for the series' second season, {{with new}} showrunners Douglas Petrie and Marco Ramirez (who {{had worked with}} DeKnight on the first season), Paesano felt that the two [...] "really were true to {{what we were trying}} to do" [...] with the first season, but the score still changed to reflect the new elements of season two [...] "that we had to acknowledge. Obviously we have two characters being introduced, we have the Punisher and Elektra, and they both have their own backstories, their own interactions with Matt Murdock, so there are way more branches in this season than there were last season ... we just had to broaden the score to handle some of these different stories." [...] Paesano continued, [...] "even though there are these new stories, it’s still in the same Hell’s Kitchen atmosphere that we’re creating. So there’s definitely differences, but it’s not like we <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sudden</b> went into John Williams territory ... it’s definitely a very grounded show but it definitely jumps up a couple levels."

The priest left them soon,--but not till it had been arranged that Neville should go back to Ennis to prepare for his reception of the Captain, and return to the cottage on the day after that interview was over. He assumed on a sudden the practical views of a man of business. He would take care to have an Ennis attorney with him when speaking to the Captain, and would be quite prepared to go to the extent of two hundred a year for the Captain's life, if the Captain could be safely purchased for that money. [...] "A quarter of it would do," [...] said Mrs. O'Hara. The priest thought £2 a week would be ample. [...] "I'll be as good as my word," [...] said Fred.
