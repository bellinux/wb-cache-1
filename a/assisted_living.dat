In this paper, a novel approach for human posture recognition is proposed. Our BSN system relies on an information fusion method based on the D-S Evidence Theory, which is applied on the accelerometer data coming from multiple wearable sensors. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed prototype system is able to achieve a recognition accuracy between 98. 5 % and 100 % for basic postures (standing, sitting, lying, squatting) ...|$|R
