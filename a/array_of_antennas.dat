5000|$|The {{original}} Telstar had {{a single}} innovative transponder that could relay data, a single television channel, or multiplexed telephone circuits. Since the spacecraft spun, it required an <b>array</b> <b>of</b> <b>antennas</b> around its [...] "equator" [...] for uninterrupted microwave communication with Earth. An omnidirectional array of small cavity antenna elements around the satellite's [...] "equator" [...] received 6 GHz microwave signals to relay back to ground stations. The transponder converted the frequency to 4 GHz, amplified the signals in a traveling-wave tube, and retransmitted them omnidirectionally via the adjacent array of larger box-shaped cavities. The prominent helical antenna received telecommands from a ground station.|$|E
50|$|An ionospheric heater, or an ionospheric HF pump facility, is a {{powerful}} radio wave transmitter with an <b>array</b> <b>of</b> <b>antennas</b> which is used for research of plasma turbulence, the ionosphere and upper atmosphere. These transmitters operate in the high frequency (HF) range (3-30 MHz) at which radio waves are reflected from the ionosphere back to the ground. With such facilities a range of plasma turbulence phenomena can be excited in a semi-controlled fashion from the ground, during conditions when the ionosphere is naturally quiet and not perturbed by for example aurora. This stimulus-response type of research complements passive observations of naturally excited phenomena {{to learn about the}} ionosphere and upper atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|The Final IRI (FIRI) is {{the final}} build of the IRI. It has 180 antenna units, {{organized}} in 15 columns by 12 rows, yielding a theoretical maximum gain of 31 dB.

The facility officially began full operations in its final 3.6 MW transmitter power completed status in the summer of 2007, yielding an effective radiated power (ERP) of 5.1 Gigawatts or 97.1 dBW at maximum output. However, the site typically operates at a fraction of that value due to the lower antenna gain exhibited at standard operational frequencies.|$|E

50|$|Their short {{wavelength}} allows narrow {{beams of}} microwaves {{to be produced}} by conveniently small high gain antennas from a half meter to 5 meters in diameter. Therefore, beams of microwaves are used for point-to-point communication links, and for radar. An advantage of narrow beams is that they don't interfere with nearby equipment using the same frequency, allowing frequency reuse by nearby transmitters. Parabolic ("dish") antennas are {{the most widely used}} directive antennas at microwave frequencies, but horn antennas, slot antennas and dielectric lens antennas are also used. Flat microstrip antennas are being increasingly used in consumer devices. Another directive antenna practical at microwave frequencies is the phased array, a computer-controlled <b>array</b> <b>of</b> <b>antennas</b> which produces a beam which can be electronically steered in different directions. Where omnidirectional antennas are required, for example in wireless devices and Wifi routers for wireless LANs, small monopoles, such as the inverted F antenna (PIFA) in cell phones, dipole, or patch antennas are used.|$|E
5000|$|One {{technique}} measures {{a distance}} {{by using the}} difference {{in the power of the}} received signal strength (RSSI) as compared to the originating signal strength. Another technique uses the time of arrival (TOA), when the time of transmission and speed of propagation are known. Combining TOA data from several receivers at different known locations (time difference of arrival, TDOA) can provide an estimate of position even in the absence of knowledge of the time of transmission. The angle of arrival (AOA) at a receiving station can be determined by the use of a directional antenna, or by differential time of arrival at an <b>array</b> <b>of</b> <b>antennas</b> with known location. AOA information may be combined with distance estimates from the techniques previously described to establish the location of a transmitter or backscatterer. Alternatively, the AOA at two receiving stations of known location establishes the position of the transmitter. The use of multiple receivers to locate a transmitter is known as multilateration.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Animation {{showing how}} a phased array works. It {{consists}} <b>of</b> an <b>array</b> <b>of</b> <b>antenna</b> elements (A) {{powered by a}} transmitter (TX). The feed current for each antenna passes through a phase shifter (Ï) controlled by a computer (C). The moving red lines show the wavefronts of the radio waves emitted by each element. The individual wavefronts are spherical, but they combine (superpose) in front <b>of</b> the <b>antenna</b> to create a plane wave, a beam of radio waves travelling in a specific direction. The phase shifters delay the radio waves progressively going up the line so each antenna emits its wavefront later than the one below it. This causes the resulting plane wave to be directed at an angle Î¸ to the antenna's axis. By changing the phase shifts the computer can instantly change the angle Î¸ of the beam. Most phased arrays have two-dimensional <b>arrays</b> <b>of</b> <b>antennas</b> instead <b>of</b> the linear <b>array</b> shown here, and the beam can be steered in two dimensions.

5000|$|In antenna theory, a {{phased array}} usually means an {{electronically}} scanned array; an <b>array</b> <b>of</b> <b>antennas</b> which creates {{a beam of}} radio waves which can be electronically steered to point in different directions, without moving the antennas. [...] In an array antenna, the radio frequency current from the transmitter is fed to the individual antennas with the correct phase relationship so that the radio waves from the separate antennas add together to increase the radiation in a desired direction, while cancelling to suppress radiation in undesired directions. In a phased array, the power from the transmitter is fed to the antennas through devices called phase shifters, controlled by a computer system, which can alter the phase electronically, thus steering the beam of radio waves to a different direction. Since the array must consist of many small antennas (sometimes thousands) to achieve high gain, phased arrays are mainly practical at the high frequency end of the radio spectrum, in the UHF and microwave bands, in which the antenna elements are conveniently small.|$|E
