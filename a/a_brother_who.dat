5|$|The term in Athens {{seems to}} have always been {{somewhat}} loosely used in legal proceedings. Apollodorus, an Athenian politician and litigant from the 4th century BCE, {{in one of his}} speeches attempted to use an Athenian law about betrothal to make his mother an epikleros. He claimed that the law defined an epikleros as a female without father, <b>a</b> <b>brother</b> <b>who</b> shared a father with her, or a paternal grandfather. His opponent, however, {{seems to have}} disputed this interpretation of the law. A speech by Isaeus, a 4th-century BCE speechwriter, rests on the claim that the speaker's mother only became an epikleros after her young brother died following their father's death. Whether the legal authorities recognized the speaker's claim as valid is unknown. It appears, at least according to some plays, that a woman with <b>a</b> <b>brother</b> <b>who</b> died after their father was considered the epikleros of her brother, not her father.|$|E
