In 2010, he released his directorial debut, Jakarta Maghrib.|$|E
5000|$|Morrison saw {{the series}} censored {{due to the}} publisher's concern over the {{possibility}} of paedophilic and child abuse content. The first such case was in volume one, issue 7 ("Arcadia part 3 : 120 Days Of Sod All"); dialogue was altered in one scene where a group rapes and degrades several nameless characters, and the term lost souls was used to ensure the characters could not be identified as children, as in the Marquis de Sade's original 120 Days of Sodom, the book the characters find themselves trapped in. Later in the series the names of people and organizations were simply blacked out, much to Morrison's dismay. DC had one line that originally read [...] "Walt Disney was a shit" [...] blacked out <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>suggestions</b> <b>of</b> their lawyers; many of these examples of censorship were restored when reprinted in trade paperback.|$|R

50|$|On 3 July 710, Emperor Zhongzong died suddenly—a {{death that}} {{traditional}} historians {{believed to be}} a poisoning carried out by Empress Wei and Li Guo'er, so that Empress Wei could be Empress Regnant like Wu Zetian and Li Guo'er could be crown princess. Under a will drafted for Emperor Zhongzong by Princess Taiping and Emperor Zhongzong's concubine Consort Shangguan Wan'er, Emperor Zhongzong's son by another concubine, Li Chongmao would be named emperor, with Empress Wei serving as empress dowager and regent, but with Li Dan as co-regent. This plan, however, was opposed by and ultimately altered <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>suggestions</b> <b>of</b> Empress Wei's cousin Wei Wen and Zong Chuke. After Li Chongmao took the throne (as Emperor Shang), Empress Wei became empress dowager and regent, while Li Dan only received an entirely ceremonial title of senior advisor to the crown prince (太子太師, Taizi Taishi) - as there was no crown prince <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time.|$|R
5|$|Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury is an oil {{on canvas}} {{painting}} by Albert Chevallier Tayler completed in 1907.

Tayler painted the picture after taking individual sittings {{with each of the}} Kent players. With the exception of short-term loans, the painting remained at the St Lawrence Ground until 1999, at which time it was moved to the Lord's Pavilion as the Kent Club could no longer afford the insurance. In 2006, Kent sold the painting to a charity foundation at an auction. The piece is currently on display at Lord's Cricket Ground in London.|$|E

The prime ministers of all the self-governing dominions were invited to London for the festivities.
