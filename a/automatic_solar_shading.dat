40|$|Modern highly glazed {{buildings}} require {{solar shading}} {{in order to}} obtain visual and thermal comfort for the occupants in addition to obtain a low energy use of the building. For the system to respond to the external conditions in an intelligent manner, automated opera- tion is needed. When utilising an <b>automatic</b> <b>solar</b> <b>shading</b> system, it is important to use a control strategy that is accepted and preferred by the occupants. Consequently, the objective {{of this study is to}} investigate occupant satisfaction with respect to visual comfort under two blind strategies: one simple control strategy with closed slats when the solar shading is activated and one more detailed control strat- egy that utilises the cut-off angle of the slats or a minimum slat angle of 15 ° when solar shading is activated. Results from the study are helpful in the development of control strategies for blinds and are indications of how blinds should be treated in building design. Responses from 40 participants in a repeated measure design survey revealed that the detailed control strategy was significantly more popular among the test subjects than the simple control strategy. Comments by the participants gave strong indications that view to the outside influenced the choice of preferred control strategy. Even if the detailed control strategy was found to be the most preferred, the results indicate that it was not sufficient to avoid glare. Based on the results, both glare and view aspects should be incorporated in the building design to a greater extent than what is common practice today. It can further be recommended that more effort is put into find- ing optimal set points for activation of the solar shading and for controlling the tilt angle of the blind {{in order to obtain}} a more robust control strategy with limited overrule actions...|$|E

40|$|<b>Solar</b> <b>shading</b> is an {{important}} architectural element {{not only for the}} purpose of reducing direct solar heat gain, but also for controlling the indoor environment quality of day-lighting and associated glare. The balance between the prevention of heat gains and natural day-light penetration is crucial for energy saving in building cooling and lighting. This paper is part of an initial research work towards designing energy efficient <b>solar</b> <b>shading</b> devices in hot humid tropics. It is mainly a critical review of measuring tools used in <b>solar</b> <b>shading</b> design.

The review concludes that the understanding of the characteristics of different types of shading devices and the methods of shading is crucial for architects to design energy efficient <b>solar</b> <b>shading.</b> However, the present methods of shading design require detailed data input or expert knowledge that is impractical during early design stage.

40|$|The {{overheating}} {{problems in}} office buildings must be solved with efficient solar shadings {{in order to}} reduce the energy demand for cooling and ventilation. At the same time the <b>solar</b> <b>shading</b> should not reduce the daylight level in the building on overcast days because it would result in a lower visual comfort level and increased en-ergy consumption for lighting. The paper describes a new type of <b>solar</b> <b>shading</b> system based on dynamic lamellas made of solar control glass with high reflectance coating which reduces the solar gain on sunny days and at the same time is able to redirect some of the daylight further into the back of the room where it is needed on overcast days. Measurements of the daylight performance were carried out on a full scale model of the <b>solar</b> <b>shading</b> system in SBi’s Daylight Labo-ratory. The results show that the shading system under overcast conditions reduces the daylight factor close to the façade while it is unchanged or even higher in the back of the room. Under sunny sky conditions the daylight level is reduced in the office. Compared to traditional <b>solar</b> <b>shading</b> systems with less transparent or opaque lamellas the proposed <b>solar</b> <b>shading</b> system yields a higher daylight factor improving the distribution and ex-ploitation of daylight in the office and furthermore it gives a less obstructed view out. Calculations show that the new system reduces the energy demand for cooling and ventilation when it is used as a traditional <b>solar</b> <b>shading</b> device and furthermore the energy demand for lighting is reduced when the glass lamellas are rotated for redi-recting the daylight further into the room...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A new sun {{shading device}} was {{developed}} by Pir 2 architects and the author {{in conjunction with the}} design of the “Wonderwall ” project. The project was awarded with a purchase in the international architectural competition “The most energy efficient building in Europe ” in Bjørvika, Oslo, September 2005. The main reason for awarding the project was the design of the east and west oriented outside walls, equipped with fixed outside <b>solar</b> <b>shading</b> panels. Additionally, fabric curtains were proposed inside the building. The design method described in this paper was developed after the competition. It is {{based on the idea that}} <b>solar</b> <b>shading</b> against strong and undesired solar radiation could be separated from <b>solar</b> <b>shading</b> against <b>solar</b> glare. The <b>shading</b> system preventing <b>solar</b> radiation is to be placed outside the façade in form of extremely optimised fixed panels. The outside shading system does not need to be 100 % opaque for <b>solar</b> radiation. The <b>shading</b> against <b>solar</b> glare is handled by inside curtains having precisely chosen light transmittance...|$|R

40|$|Electricity {{producing}} <b>solar</b> <b>shading</b> provides {{possibilities for}} a combined solution for <b>solar</b> <b>shading</b> and building integrated locally produced energy from renewable sources. The multi-functionality {{of these products}} calls for collaboration between a range of actors from manufacturers, clients, architects, engineers, and contractors. Two major challenges for the increased up-take of the technology has been identified and is dealt with in a transdisciplinary research project, called ELSA, involving industry and academic institutions. First, the successful architectural integration of <b>solar</b> <b>shading</b> in terms of form, size, colour, detailing etc. {{in relation to the}} overall building design will be decisive in order to persuade architects. Second, the development of these multi-functional products to reach functional, technical, economic and aesthetical qualities is dependent upon communication between different professions. As a means to initiate a dialogue between the different professional groups taking part in the ELSA project, a model, the AIQ-model (Architectural Integration Qualities), to assess preferences for architectural integration of energy producing <b>solar</b> <b>shading</b> was developed and tested in a workshop. The results indicate a large consensus across different professional groups when assessing successful architectural integrations. Consequently, discrepancies in aesthetic appraisal of energy producing <b>solar</b> <b>shading</b> should not be the main hindrance for a broader implementation of such solutions. The challenge rather lies in that architectural integration qualities will concur with other important aspects of the multi-functional solution, and not all professional groups will put architectural integration qualities above other functions. The workshop shows that the AIQ model serves its function to initiate and to focus discussions. The value of group discussions to reach consensus was also observed. The AIQ model provide definitions to clarify the judgment base behind aesthetic assessments that was appreciated but all groups but most easily applied by the architects. The model should be further developed to include also other aspects than aesthetics...|$|R

The motivation behind this research is to examine, if the inclusion of <b>solar</b> <b>shading</b> into building design can assist in the comfort of the users who occupy these buildings and to investigate can the incorporation of a <b>solar</b> <b>shading</b> system aid in the reduction of expenditure on mechanical cooling. In order to assess this, an examination has been carried out on published information regarding relevant aspects of <b>solar</b> <b>shading</b> encompassing the effects of solar gain on buildings (i. e. solar glare and heat gain), the impact on users of buildings and the possible reduction in reliance on air conditioning. An analysis of how such an assessment would take place through sun paths and glazing transmittance has been discussed. The various shading techniques possible have been outlined, followed by an examination of differing control methods and their application. In order to quantify shading and glazing transmittance an assessment of the g-value is outlined with the relevant pre-determined tables. A cost benefit analysis is included to discuss the cost implications of including a shading system and the reduction in expenditure on air conditioning from previous studies is outlined. The conclusions of this research are that shading systems have a definite role to play in achieving an environmentally sound building; however, every building will require differing analysis to uncover the most applicable shading and control system for the subject building...|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown the {{effectiveness}} of shading devices in reducing building cooling needs. However, {{the choice of a}} specific shading device remains quite difficult for designers.

40|$|In Europe, the {{building}} energy demand is about 40 % {{of the total}} energy requirement. In order to obtain signiﬁcant energy saving in this sector, the European Energy Performance Building Directive (EPBD) 2002 / 91 /CE and the EPBD Recast (Directive 2010 / 31 /UE) promote the use of passive strategies for buildings, which improve indoor thermal conditions above all in summer and so allow the reduction of size and energy requirements of air conditioning systems.
