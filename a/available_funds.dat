It was decided to not start building until permission had been received for all phases of the development including the rebuilding of the Cricket Field Stand. In October 2008, the project was put on hold by the club {{as a result of the}} global economic crisis restricting <b>available</b> <b>funds.</b> Revised plans were revealed in November 2009, with further announcements expected in early 2010.

25|$|In the mid-1930s, Moses {{oversaw the}} {{conversion}} of a vast Queens tidal marsh garbage dump into the fairgrounds that hosted the 1939/1940 World's Fair. Called Flushing Meadows Park, it was Moses' grandest park scheme. He envisioned this vast park, comprising some 1,300acres(5km2) of land, easily accessible from Manhattan, as a major recreational playground for New Yorkers. When the 1939/1940 World's Fair ended in financial failure, Moses {{did not have the}} <b>available</b> <b>funds</b> to complete work on his project. He saw the 1964/1965 Fair as a means to finish what the earlier fair had begun.|$|E

However, a counterargument that <b>available</b> <b>funds</b> should be prioritised for government factories found greater favour. Following the disbandment of the Defence Resources Board in April 1937, Beavis returned to his regular army duties.|$|E

In 2013, it was announced that the line will be constructed initially as a bus rapid transit line, but with the capability to convert to light rail in the future. The bus rapid transit line could be functioning as early as 2017.|$|E

25|$|President Bush {{advocated}} the partial privatization of Social Security in 2005-2006, but was unsuccessful in achieving any reforms {{to the program}} against strong congressional resistance. His proposal would have diverted some of the payroll tax revenues that fund the program into private accounts. Critics argued that privatizing Social Security does nothing to address the long-term funding challenge facing the program. Diverting funds to private accounts would reduce <b>available</b> <b>funds</b> to pay current retirees, requiring significant borrowing. An analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that President Bush's 2005 privatization proposal would have added $1 trillion in new federal debt in its first decade of implementation and $3.5 trillion in the decade thereafter.|$|E
25|$|On August 6, 2010, the CBC {{issued a}} press release stating that due to {{financial}} reasons, the CBC and Radio-Canada would only transition 27 transmitters total, one in each market where there was an originating station (i.e. a CBC or Radio-Canada television station located in that market). Further, the CBC stated in the release, that only 15 of the transmitters would be in place by August 31, 2011 {{due to lack of}} <b>available</b> <b>funds,</b> and that the remainder would not be on the air until as late as August 31, 2012. Additionally, the CBC stated in the release that it was asking the CRTC for permission to continue broadcasting in analogue until the identified transmitters for transition were up and running. At the time of the press release, only eight of the corporation's transmitters (four CBC and four Radio Canada) were broadcasting in digital.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{conversion}} of nonexempt assets into exempt assets {{on the eve}} of bankruptcy would not be indicia of fraud per se. However, depending on the amount of the exemption and the circumstances surrounding the conversion, a court may find the conversion to be a fraudulent transfer. This is especially true when the conversion amounts to nothing more than a temporary arrangement. The cases that held a {{conversion of}} nonexempt into exempt assets to be a fraudulent transfer tend to focus on the existence of an independent reason for the conversion. For example, if a debtor purchased a residence protected by a homestead exemption with the intent to reside in such residence that would be an allowable conversion into nonexempt property. But where the debtor purchased the residence with all of their <b>available</b> <b>funds,</b> leaving no money to live off, that presumed that the conversion was temporary, indicating a fraudulent transfer. The courts look at the timing of the transfer as the most important factor.|$|E
