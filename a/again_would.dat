5|$|A {{number of}} lessons had been {{learned from the}} 1856 {{disaster}} that allowed the Church to continue the handcart system while avoiding another disaster. Never <b>again</b> <b>would</b> a handcart company depart Florence later than July 7. The construction of the handcarts was modified to strengthen them and reduce repairs. The handcarts would now be regularly greased. Arrangements were made to replenish supplies along the route.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} months of 116AD, Trajan {{captured}} the Persian city of Susa. When Sanatruces II of Parthia gathered forces in eastern Parthia to challenge the Romans, his cousin Parthamaspates of Parthia betrayed and killed him: Trajan crowned him the new king of Parthia. Never <b>again</b> <b>would</b> the Roman Empire advance so far to the east.|$|E

5|$|Moffat {{had written}} all six episodes {{of the first}} series before {{recording}} commenced. Never <b>again</b> <b>would</b> he be so far in advance of production. With series two, he had written only the first four episodes by the time recording had commenced, only delivering the final episode by {{the first day of}} rehearsals.|$|E
5|$|But the WFM's {{success at}} Cripple Creek {{also created a}} {{significant}} backlash. The WFM was forever tarred as a dangerous and violent organization {{in the eyes of}} employers. Never <b>again</b> <b>would</b> the WFM have in a local strike the level of public support it enjoyed at Cripple Creek in 1894. Indeed, when the union struck the Cripple Creek mines again in 1898, its public support ended after violence broke out. During another strike in 1903–4, whose violent significance earned it the name Colorado Labor Wars, the union went up against the power of the employers and the state combined.|$|E
5|$|Militarily, {{the siege}} of Nicaea was the high-water-mark of the post-718 Umayyad raids; never <b>again</b> <b>would</b> Umayyad armies {{penetrate}} as deeply into Asia Minor. Increasingly thereafter the Syro-Jaziran army, that provided the manpower for the raids against Byzantium, was diverted in the hard and fruitless wars against the Khazars in the Caucasus: the Khazars inflicted a heavy defeat on the Muslims in 730, and a Byzantine–Khazar alliance was sealed by the marriage of Leo III's son and heir Constantine V (r. 741–775) with the Khazar princess Irene shortly after. Over the next few years, while Byzantine strength revived, the Muslim military situation on all fronts of the over-extended Caliphate deteriorated. Consequently, in the 730s, Arab raids were mostly limited to the immediate frontier regions and their successes became fewer. By 740, when the Umayyads assembled the largest invasion force fielded after 718, the Byzantines had recovered enough to inflict a heavy defeat against them at the Battle of Akroinon.|$|E

50|$|Gomez <b>would</b> <b>again</b> try {{his hand}} in the AHL in 2004/05, this time with the Hershey Bears. <b>Again</b> it <b>would</b> only be a short spell, this time lasting only three games. Gomez failed to score a single point in the time, but totalled an average of almost 10 penalty minutes a game.|$|R
5|$|The mission's second spacewalk officially {{began at}} 12:49 UTC, and the pair {{set to work}} {{removing}} and replacing the telescope's three gyroscope rate sensing units (RSUs). Each unit contains two gyroscopes that allow the telescope to point itself. The first unit, RSU 2, was replaced without problems, but when they attempted to replace the second unit, RSU 3, the unit would not align onto the guide pins, and they could not seat it into the equipment bay. Managers decided to put the unit originally intended for the RSU 1 bay into the RSU 3 bay, and it was installed without problems. The pair then attempted to install the second unit into {{the third and final}} bay, but the unit <b>again</b> <b>would</b> not seat properly, and they were unable to install it. Instead, it was decided that an additional unit carried as a spare would be placed into the final bay. The spare unit was one that was removed during the STS-103 mission, and had been refurbished on the ground. The installation of all three gyro units was a critical objective of the servicing mission, as three had failed, one was offline due to electrical issues, and the other two had also been experiencing issues with performance. Ground controllers at Goddard Space Flight Center confirmed that all six gyroscopes and the new battery passed preliminary tests.|$|E
25|$|A bishop {{may also}} call a sobor for his diocese, which <b>again</b> <b>would</b> have delegates from the clergy, monasteries and parishes of his diocese, to discuss {{important}} matters. Such diocesan sobors may be held annually or only occasionally.|$|E
25|$|Danny Wuerffel <b>again</b> <b>would</b> have an {{outstanding}} game, bolstering his Heisman Trophy candidacy, with 279 yards passing and 4 touchdowns. The Gators also amassed over 200 yards rushing. The Gator defense held the Dawgs to just 272 yards and one touchdown on the day.|$|E
50|$|A third {{straight}} Anglo-Scottish Cup campaign awaited the Tigers in 1977-78. <b>Again,</b> Hull <b>would</b> compete in Group 4 of the English Qualifiers, which <b>would</b> <b>again</b> feature Sheffield United. The other {{clubs in the}} group were Notts County and Oldham Athletic. Hull finished last, picking one solitary point, in a 1-1 draw with Oldham at Boundary Park.|$|R

25|$|In {{response}} to independent attempts at {{sampling of the}} water quality and the taking of photos, the TVA illegally detained, for approximately one hour, {{two members of the}} Knoxville, Tennessee-based environmental organization United Mountain Defense who were traversing public land {{in the area of the}} spill, and cited three other individuals, warning them that any attempt to enter the public waterway <b>again</b> <b>would</b> lead to prosecution.|$|E
25|$|Susa {{became a}} {{frequent}} {{place of refuge}} for Parthian and later, the Persian Sassanid kings, as the Romans sacked Ctesiphon five different times between 116 and 297 AD (Susa was briefly captured only by Roman emperor Trajan in 116AD and never <b>again</b> <b>would</b> the Roman Empire advance so far to the east). Typically, the Parthian rulers wintered in Susa, and spent the summer in Ctesiphon.|$|E

25|$|De Gaulle's {{resignation}} in 1969, {{and more}} importantly the 1970 election of the Liberals in Quebec under Robert Bourassa gave impetus to the calls on both sides for normalization of France-Canada relations. While the ultra-Gaullists and the remaining members of the 'Quebec Mafia' continue to occasionally cause headaches for Canada - such as a 1997 initiative by 'Mafia' members to have the French Post Office issue a stamp commemorating de Gaulle's 1967 visit to Montreal - never <b>again</b> <b>would</b> relations reach anything close to the hostility of the late 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Argentina was {{originally}} planned to begin hosting a tenth {{event in the}} 2012–13 season, giving the tour an event on each continent, but those plans have been shelved indefinitely. 2012–13 was meant to have another round being added with Mar Del Plata being the venue. But when Argentina join the Rugby Championship the tournament was cancelled which meant that with the same schedule, New Zealand <b>again</b> <b>would</b> be the winners by 41 points over South Africa. They would take it again in 2013–14 with Spain being {{the first team to}} be relegated after finishing last during that season with Japan replacing them.|$|E
25|$|The second specimen, CAGS-IG-T1, also {{preserves}} {{the remains of}} several meals. Disarticulated bones were found, {{in front of the}} lower ischia, identified as belonging to at least two individuals of Confuciusornis sanctus, a basal bird that is very common in the formation. Also a 13.5 centimetres long scapula was discovered, belonging to some 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) long herbivorous ornithischian, perhaps Yueosaurus or a Psittacosaurus species. The bone surface of the scapula {{looked as if it had}} been etched by stomach acid for about thirteen days, leading to the conclusion the birds were swallowed later and in quick succession. This <b>again</b> <b>would</b> indicate a high metabolism for Sinocalliopteryx, necessitating a regular food intake.|$|E

25|$|In Twenty20 cricket (T20), Swaziland would {{compete in}} the ICC Africa Twenty20 Championship. They made their T20 debut in the 2011 Second Division. Swaziland would finish sixth out of nine teams in the competition. They won three matches with wins against Mozambique, Rwanda and Malawi. They beat Mozambique by eight wickets, Rwanda by six wickets and Malawi by five runs. Swaziland lost against Sierra Leone, Botswana, Ghana, Tanzania, Nigeria. For the 2012 season, Swaziland <b>again</b> <b>would</b> compete in Division Two of the Africa Twenty20 Championship. The Swazis' only won one match; a six-wicket win over Seychelles. In the eight team competition, Swaziland would finish seventh; beating only Sierra Leone. Therefore, Swaziland, along with Sierra Leone, would be relegated to Division Three for the next season.|$|E
25|$|The war {{had great}} consequences. The Middle East had been {{dominated}} for centuries {{by the power}} of the Fatimid Caliphate and the Byzantine Empire; {{by the end of the}} 13th century, neither of the two were in a position to project power; the Fatimids having been toppled by the Kurdish influenced Ayyubids, whilst the Byzantines severely weakened by the Seljuqs. Power shifted to the Mamelukes by the 14th century and then back to the Turks in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Never <b>again</b> <b>would</b> a Christian Kingdom wield so much military and political power in the Middle East. As the Turks steadily gained ground in Anatolia, the local population converted to Islam, further reducing any chances of a successful reconquest.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, Sondheim was {{approached}} by Laurents and Robbins for a musical version of Gypsy Rose Lee's memoir after Irving Berlin and Cole Porter turned it down. Sondheim agreed, but Ethel Merman – cast as Mama Rose – had just finished Happy Hunting with an unknown composer (Harold Karr) and lyricist (Matt Dubey). Although Sondheim wanted to write the music and lyrics, Merman refused to let another first-time composer write for her and demanded that Jule Styne write the music. Sondheim, concerned that writing lyrics <b>again</b> <b>would</b> pigeonhole him as a lyricist, called his mentor for advice. Hammerstein told him he should take the job, because writing a vehicle for a star {{would be a good}} learning experience. Sondheim agreed; Gypsy opened on May 21, 1959, and ran for 702 performances.|$|E
