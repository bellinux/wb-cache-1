5|$|Referring to {{the cases}} in which the High Court had upheld the wartime {{legislation}} allowing indefinite <b>administrative</b> <b>detention,</b> Kirby said that equivalent decisions in other countries had come to be regarded as embarrassing and incorrect, and should be likewise regarded in Australia. While conceding that the scope of the Parliament's powers with respect to defence will be greater in wartime than in peacetime, Kirby said that they could not extend so far as to displace fundamental constitutional requirements such as those in Chapter III.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} whether the Act was constitutionally valid {{revolved}} around the fact that immigration detention {{is a form of}} <b>administrative</b> <b>detention,</b> or detention imposed by the executive branch of government. Detention generally {{is considered to be a}} judicial function, which can be exercised only by courts, pursuant to Chapter III of the Australian Constitution. However, there are certain exceptions which allow non-judicial detention, such as detention in order to effect an arrest, or detention for quarantine purposes. Courts in Australia have also held that, generally, detention of non-citizens for immigration purposes is also valid.|$|E

5|$|Many of the {{policies}} and practices which resulted in individuals being punished for peacefully exercising their human rights by sending them to RTL have not fundamentally changed: quite the contrary. There is ample evidence that such policies and practices are continuing in full force. The latest anti-Falun Gong campaign, launched earlier this year and intended to operate for three years, shows that the CCP’s determination to rid China of this spiritual group has not abated. Falun Gong practitioners continue to be punished through criminal prosecution and being sent to “brainwashing centres” {{and other forms of}} arbitrary detention. Petitioners likewise continue to be subjected to harassment, forcibly committed to mental institutions and sent to “black jails” and other forms of arbitrary detention. Human rights defenders, democracy advocates, whistle-blowers and other political activists are also being increasingly targeted through criminal detention, “black jails”, short-term <b>administrative</b> <b>detention,</b> and enforced disappearances, rather than RTL.|$|E

A variety of Israeli legislative measures facilitated the transfer of land abandoned by Arabs to state ownership. These included the Absentee Property Law of 1950 which allowed the state to take control of land belonging to land owners who emigrated to other countries, and the Land Acquisition Law of 1953 which authorized the Ministry of Finance to transfer expropriated land to the state. Other common legal expedients included the use of emergency regulations to declare land belonging to Arab citizens a closed military zone, followed by the use of Ottoman legislation on abandoned land to take control of the land.|$|R

Following mounting ethnic tensions anti-Chinese sentiments were expressed at a UMNO Youth rally held in Kampung Baru, Kuala Lumpur the same year where Najib spoke. Rising tensions soon lead to fears of ethnic violence and eventually resulted in a security operation known as Operasi Lalang, that included numerous <b>administrative</b> <b>detentions.</b> In June 2009 Najib overturned a rule that required 30% Malay ownership in corporations, and allowed non-ethnic Malays, like the Chinese and the Indians to exercise more financial control in Malaysia. Najib has also worked to improve relations with Singapore, which is seen by many as Chinese-dominated, to encourage it to invest more heavily in the Malaysian economy.|$|R
50|$|Military {{administrative}} {{government was}} in effect from 1949 to 1966 over some geographical areas of Israel having large Arab populations, primarily the Negev, Galilee, and the Triangle. The residents of these areas were subject {{to a number of}} controlling measures that amounted to martial law. The Israeli army enforced strict residency rules. Any Arab not registered in a census taken during November 1948 was deported. Permits from the military governor had to be procured to travel more than a given distance from a person's registered place of residence, and curfew, <b>administrative</b> <b>detentions,</b> and expulsions were common. Although the military administration was officially for geographical areas, and not people, its restrictions were seldom enforced on the Jewish residents of these areas. In the 1950s, martial law ceased to be in effect for those Arab citizens living in predominantly Jewish cities, but remained in place in all Arab localities within Israel until 1966.|$|R

Haidallah officially came in second with about 19% of the vote, although he alleged fraud; he was arrested immediately after the election, accused of plotting a coup. Haidallah had also been briefly detained just prior to the vote. On December 28, 2003 he received a five-year suspended sentence and therefore was set free, but barred from politics for five years.

40|$|ABSTRACT FROM VIOLATION TO REVELATION: FINDING FAITH IN THE DEPTHS OF PRISON HELL Darcella Anita Patterson Sessomes, LCSW Ram Cnaan, Ph. D., Dissertation Chair As the {{violence}} in the United States grows, so does the potential for increased violence and misconduct inside its prisons. Religiosity and spirituality are two areas in which the social work profession is beginning to understand its value and in the rehabilitative and behavioral change process. This quantitative study explores two hypotheses: H 1 - inmates who participate in worship services and faith-based programs will have less disciplinary infractions than those who do not participate, and H 2 - inmates who participate in worship services and faith-based programs will have fewer times sent to <b>administrative</b> segregation or <b>detention</b> than those who do not participate. A secondary data analysis approach was achieved by examining the disciplinary infractions and the amount of times sent to <b>administrative</b> segregation and <b>detention</b> of a sample of 454 inmates. The analysis is presented in two parts: a preliminary and a primary analysis. Likeliness Ration Chi Squares of Omnibus Test, parametric values (i. e. mean, median) were calculated. Preliminary analyses consist of T-test, ANOVA, crosstabs, Chi-square test and Spearman’s correlation were utilized to test the relationship between each pair of variables. The primary analysis consists of negative binomial regression models. Findings from the both the preliminary and primary analyses indicate that although both hypotheses were not rejected, they received little support...|$|R
5000|$|The Criminal Procedure Law of China (中华人民共和国刑事诉讼法) {{provides}} for {{all phases of}} the criminal process. This is distinct from the system of <b>administrative</b> punishments (including <b>detention</b> for periods of multiple years) and procedures which are governed under a separate system of laws and regulations.

40|$|This work {{examines}} the legal {{effects of a}} declaration {{of a state of}} emergency under the Public Safety Act 3 of 1953 and the exercise of legislative and administrative powers pursuant thereto. The general basis of judicial control over executive action and the various devices used to limit or oust the court's jurisdiction are set out and explained. Against this background, the courts' performance of their supervisory role under the special circumstances of emergency rule is critically surveyed and assessed. The legal issues raised by the exercise of emergency powers is examined at the various levels of their deployment: first, the declaration of a state of emergency; second, the making of emergency regulations; third, their execution by means of <b>administrative</b> action, including <b>detention,</b> banning, censorship and the use of force. The major cases concerning emergency issues, both reported and unreported, are analysed in their appropriate contexts, and an overview provided of the effects of emergency regulations and orders on such freedoms as South Africans enjoy under the 'ordinary' law. Finally, an attempt is made to assess how these decisions have affected the prospect of judicial review of executive action, both in the emergency context and in the field of administrative law generally. The conclusion is that, however far the Appellate Division may appear to have gone towards eliminating the role of the law in the emergency regime, grounds remain for the courts to exercise a more vigorous supervisory role should they choose to do so in future. ...|$|R

500|$|In a 2005 {{speech to}} the Law Society of the University of Sydney, Justice McHugh reiterated {{his view of the}} case as a tragic situation, and said that it was {{necessary}} for [...] "the informed and impassioned" [...] to seek reforms to legislation to protect individual rights, since the absence of a bill of rights limited the ability of the courts to protect rights. McHugh said that cases in countries such as the United Kingdom, in which courts had found that indefinite <b>administrative</b> <b>detention</b> was not lawful, were based on bills of rights or other instruments such as the European Convention on Human Rights, and lamented that without such instruments, Australian courts are [...] "not empowered to be as active as the Supreme Court of the United States or the House of Lords in the defence of the fundamental principles of human rights." ...|$|E
500|$|Justice McHugh drew analogies {{between the}} {{legislation}} {{at issue in}} the case, and previous legislation which had authorised indefinite <b>administrative</b> <b>detention,</b> such as the arrangements under the War Precautions Act 1914. Regulations made under that and other acts allowed the internment of several thousand people, including German Australians during World War I and Japanese Australians during World War II. McHugh noted that those arrangements had been challenged, and upheld, in the High Court (for example in the 1915 case of Lloyd v Wallach), and emphasised that at no time had anyone questioned that detention for protective purposes, as opposed to punitive purposes, would conflict with Chapter III. He concluded that although the situation at hand was [...] "tragic", the courts were {{not at liberty to}} question the propriety of decisions made by the Parliament of Australia on moral or human rights grounds, given the absence of a bill of rights in Australia.|$|E
500|$|Sentencing for re-education through {{labor is}} {{generally}} {{carried out by}} the police rather than by the judicial system, so individuals are rarely charged or tried before being detained. Public security bureaus (police offices) are able to carry out administrative detentions for [...] "minor" [...] infringements that are not considered criminal acts; [...] at least one analyst has suggested that local public security bureaus often abuse their authority and detain individuals for things such as personal vendettas. [...] Individuals may also be sentenced to re-education through labor by courts, but the proportion of individuals who receive trials rather than going directly into <b>administrative</b> <b>detention</b> is determined in part by how much capacity that province has for re-education detaineesprovinces with large re-education through labor apparatus generally allow fewer detainees to have trials. Where detainees have been allowed a trial, their lawyers have faced [...] "intimidation and abuse," [...] according to some reports, and the individuals under trial have sometimes been convicted on the basis of confessions that were coerced through [...] "torture and severe psychological pressure." [...] In at least one instance, convicted individuals were sent to re-education through labor even after being found not guilty in a trial.|$|E
500|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} calls for the system to be reformed or replaced.

[...] The prominent deaths of two inmates in spring 2003 prompted many calls within China for reform of the system, but reform did not happen immediately, though The China Daily reported that there was [...] "general consensus" [...] that reform was needed. [...] In March 2007, however, the Chinese government did announce that it would abolish the re-education through labor system {{and replace it with a}} more lenient set of laws. [...] According to the proposal, the maximum sentence would be lowered from four years to 18 months; re-education centers would be renamed [...] "correction centers" [...] and have their fences and gates removed. [...] A month later, Chongqing municipality passed a law allowing lawyers to offer legal counsel in re-education through labor cases.|$|E
