40|$|There are {{existing}} measures of exercise motives (what people want from exercise), but corresponding measures of gains (what people get) are needed, because motives <b>and</b> <b>gains</b> could influence {{each other and}} together influence other variables. An exercise motives <b>and</b> <b>gains</b> inventory (EMGI) was developed by creating gains scales to complement existing Exercise Motivations Inventory 2 scales. Confirmatory factor analyses of EMGI items established that items reflected their intended constructs; and that motive <b>and</b> <b>gain</b> constructs were distinct. Exploratory structural equation modeling of EMGI scales established that the higher-order structures of motives <b>and</b> <b>gains</b> were somewhat different: Appearance motive was associated with weight management, whereas appearance gain was associated with health and fitness. Paired-sample t-tests established that gains were less than motives in some instances (ill-health avoidance, positive health), and greater in others (e. g., affiliation, challenge). The EMGI {{can be used to}} investigate the consequences and causes of motives <b>and</b> <b>gains...</b>|$|R

It {{is aimed at}} finding out the loss <b>and</b> <b>gain</b> technique in the interpreting of two Governor' speeches by interpreter and evaluating which interpreter is able to use more accurate loss <b>and</b> <b>gain</b> technique in interpreting the speeches of Governor. Documentation method was used to collect the data by finding the recording, watching and transcribing the speeches and its interpreting result by listening and typing the Indonesian speech as the source language and English speech as the target language. The discussion began by identifying loss or gain technique used in two speeches based on McGuire's theory. Furthermore, identifying the accuracy of loss <b>and</b> <b>gain</b> technique used in the interpreting result by those interpreters based on Kopczynski's theory that is aimed to conclude which interpreter had a better accuracy in using loss <b>and</b> <b>gain</b> technique in interpreting the speeches of Governor. The result of analysis shows Interpreter X used 27 patterns (37, 5 %) of loss technique and 45 patterns (62, 5 %) of gain technique while Interpreter Y used 30 patterns (60 %) of loss technique and 20 patterns (40 %) of gain technique. Furthermore, there are 39 accurate pattern (54, 17 %) and 33 inaccurate pattern (45, 83 %) of 72 loss <b>and</b> <b>gain</b> pattern in the interpreting result of ''ASEAN Workshop on Cultural Heritage Tourism'' speech by Mr. X.
