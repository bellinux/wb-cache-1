5|$|Presidential {{elections}} in Singapore, {{in which the}} President of Singapore is directly elected by popular vote, were introduced through amendments to the Constitution of Singapore in 1991. Potential candidates for office have to fulfil stringent qualifications {{set out in the}} Constitution. Certificates of eligibility are issued by the Presidential Elections Committee (PEC). In particular, the PEC must assess that they are persons of integrity, good character and reputation; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not previously held certain key government appointments or were the chief executives of profitable companies with shareholders' equity of an average of S$500 million for the most recent three years in that office, they must demonstrate to the PEC that they held a position of comparable seniority and responsibility in the public or private sector that has given them experience and ability in administering and managing financial affairs. The general strictness of the required qualifications led to the walkovers in 3 out of 5 of the presidential elections, as presidents S. R. Nathan and Halimah Yacob were the sole candidates to receive a certificate of eligibility from the PEC in their respective years in the 1999, 2005 and 2017 elections. The stringent criteria, the transparency of the PEC's decision-making process and the practice of political parties endorsing candidates have drawn criticism.|$|E
25|$|The {{only way}} of getting around obtaining the {{permission}} of the wife or of the wives is if she or if they are unsound, if they have died, if they have completely and finally renounced the world, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> ceased to be a Hindu. Men who are unmarried can adopt as well {{as long as they are}} not a minor. However, if a man were to adopt a daughter, the man must be twenty one years of age or older.|$|E
25|$|In modern-day Saudi Arabia, the Grand Mosque {{and all of}} Mecca {{are open}} only to Muslims. Likewise, the Al-Masjid al-Nabawi {{and the city of}} Medina that {{surrounds}} it are also off-limits to those who do not practice Islam. For mosques in other areas, it has most commonly been taken that non-Muslims may only enter mosques if granted permission to do so by Muslims <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a legitimate reason. All entrants regardless of religious affiliation are expected to respect the rules and decorum for mosques.|$|E

At {{the conclusion of the}} film, Draco, the last dragon, ascends into the constellation after he sacrifices himself to destroy an evil king that he had saved years ago.|$|E
25|$|The most {{suitable}} couple is one {{made up by}} crossed cousins. Parallel cousins marriage is forbidden, that being the reason why each man looks for a suitable woman in groups where his maternal sisters and aunts are married and therefore the unmarried are eligible. If the woman {{still lives in the}} home of the father, the gifts must include him. If the woman accepts, she settles down in the encampment of the man <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a child then they are considered a formal pair, which establishes mutual relations of kinship, expressed in rights and duties of reciprocity.|$|E
25|$|Several studies {{investigated}} {{factors that}} influence the decision to plagiarize. For example, a panel study with students from German universities found that academic procrastination predicts the frequency plagiarism conducted within six months followed the measurement of academic procrastination. It {{has been argued that}} by plagiarizing students cope with the negative consequences that result from academic procrastination such as poor grades. Another study found that plagiarism is more frequent if students perceive plagiarism as beneficial <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> the opportunity to plagiarize. When students had expected higher sanctions and when they had internalized social norms that define plagiarism as very objectionable, plagiarism was less likely to occur.|$|E

25|$|Whilst {{elements}} with atomic numbers {{expected for}} the island of stability have been produced, the total nucleon count of these nuclides has been too low. These synthesised nuclides have contained too few neutrons to reach the supposed stable region. It is possible that these elements possess unusual chemical properties <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> isotopes with adequate lifespans, would be available for various practical applications (such as particle accelerator targets and as neutron sources as well). In particular, the very small critical masses of transplutonic elements (possibly as small as grams) implies that if stable elements could be found, they would enable small and compact nuclear bombs either directly or by serving as primaries to help ignite fission/fusion secondaries; this possibility motivated much of the early research in the 1960s and multiple nuclear tests by the United States (including Operation Plowshare) and the Soviet Union aimed at producing such elements.|$|E
25|$|Death {{in those}} with a GI bleed is more {{commonly}} due to other illnesses (some of which {{may have contributed to}} the bleed, such as cancer or cirrhosis) than the bleeding itself. Of those admitted to a hospital because of a GI bleed, death occurs in about 7%. Despite treatment, re-bleeding occurs in about 7–16% of those with upper GI bleeding. In those with esophageal varices, bleeding occurs in about 5–15% a year <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> bled once, there is a higher risk of further bleeding within six weeks. Testing and treating H. pylori if found can prevent re-bleeding {{in those with}} peptic ulcers. The benefits versus risks of restarting blood thinners such as aspirin or warfarin and anti-inflammatories such as NSAIDs need to be carefully considered. If aspirin is needed for cardiovascular disease prevention, it is reasonable to restart it within seven days in combination with a PPI for those with nonvariceal upper GI bleeding.|$|E
25|$|Justice Chan {{relied on}} a United Kingdom case, Secretary of State for Education and Science v. Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council (1976), to {{ascertain}} the law with regard to this ground of judicial review. In this case, the House of Lords held that statutory provisions which are framed to include the word satisfaction may exclude judicial review on matters of pure judgment by the decision-maker, but judicial review will not be excluded in all cases. Lord Wilberforce held that when the judgment {{is dependent on the}} existence of relevant facts, the court has to ascertain if the facts truly exist <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been properly taken into account, although the evaluation of the facts is for the decision-maker alone. If these requirements are not met, an aggrieved person is entitled to challenge the decision, and the court can intervene {{on the grounds that the}} decision-maker acted outside its powers, outside the purpose of the legislation empowering it, unfairly, or upon an incorrect basis of fact. Lord Diplock mentioned it was also necessary to consider if the decision-maker had taken into consideration only matters which he ought to have considered.|$|E

25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> the right to a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E
