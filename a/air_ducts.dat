Even though his show-and-tell {{presentation}} is well received by the class, the dog escapes into the school <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> to follow the food scent coming from the kitchen and is spotted by Ralph. Groundskeeper Willie is sent after the dog and catches it, but he chooses the wrong vent to exit and the fire department is called in to rescue him. As the firemen are attempting to rescue Willie, an outraged Superintendent Chalmers appears and fires Principal Skinner, much to Bart's shock.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. CFD {{technique}} is often employed to simulate and optimize <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> design, but the corresponding experiment validation in metro vehicle is rare. By taking an independent metro vehicle duct as research object in this paper, supply <b>air</b> through <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> is simulated and {{compared with the}} actual test results from the angle of supply air velocity at each outlet and supply air volume through several outlets of <b>air</b> <b>duct.</b> The {{results show that the}} relative deviation of simulation and test value of air velocity at most of the outlets are within or near ± 20 %, which is acceptable for the engineering applications. Moreover, the ratio of supply air volume through several outlets to the corresponding total supply air volume through main <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> or flat duct in the case of simulation is consistent with {{that in the case of}} experiment.

5|$|Annoyed {{that none}} of his {{co-workers}} {{paid attention to the}} fire safety seminar he gave last week, Dwight (Rainn Wilson) tries another approach by sealing the office exits shut, cutting the phone lines and starting a fire in a trash can. Dwight calmly explains the proper safety procedures as the panicked employees try to flee, smashing windows, crawling through <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> and destroying office equipment. Dwight eventually reveals it was just a drill, but Stanley (Leslie David Baker) suffers a heart attack and collapses in the commotion. Dwight is subsequently censured by Dunder Mifflin CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley), and Michael (Steve Carell) strips him of his position as safety officer. After Stanley is released from the hospital, his doctors warn him to keep his stress levels under control to avoid further damaging his health. Michael arranges for a CPR training session for the employees, but they are too easily distracted and the lesson proves fruitless. The session ends badly when Dwight destroys the expensive CPR dummy, earning another rebuke from David Wallace. Dwight is ordered to apologize to his co-workers and get signatures acknowledging that they forgive him, but after he openly declares that his apology is insincere and denies that he is responsible for Stanley's heart attack, they refuse to sign.|$|E
5|$|Due to a {{shortage}} of Brownings, which had been selected as the new standard rifle calibre machine gun for the RAF in 1934, early Spitfires were fitted with only four guns, with the other four fitted later. Early tests showed that while the guns worked perfectly {{on the ground and}} at low altitudes, they tended to freeze at high altitude, especially the outer wing guns. This was because the RAF's Brownings had been modified to fire from an open bolt. While this prevented overheating of the cordite used in British ammunition, it allowed cold air to flow through the barrel unhindered. Supermarine did not fix the problem until October 1938, when they added hot <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> {{from the rear of the}} wing mounted radiators to the guns, and bulkheads around the gunbays to trap the hot air in the wing. Red fabric patches were doped over the gun ports to protect the guns from cold, dirt and moisture until they were fired. Even if the eight Brownings worked perfectly, pilots soon discovered that they were not sufficient to destroy larger aircraft. Combat reports showed that an average of 4,500 rounds were needed to shoot down an enemy aircraft. In November 1938, tests against armoured and unarmoured targets had already indicated that the introduction of a weapon with a calibre of at least 20mm was urgently needed.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{ventilated}} facades and roofs {{can help}} to reduce summer thermal loads and, therefore, the energy consumption due to air-conditioning systems. This paper discusses a simple analytical method for the calculation of the energy saving achievable by using ventilated facades in which the air flow inside the <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> is due to stack effect. Two particular cases of outstanding importance are investigated. The first in which the inner masonry wall is given, and the <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> and the outer facing have to be optimized. The second in which the outer facing is given, and the inner masonry wall and the <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> have to be optimized. The first case can occur in existing buildings renovation, while the second case can occur during the design process. Finally, {{the influence of the}} variation of some quantities necessary for calculation on the energy performance of ventilated facades is investigated. In particular, the energy performance of such facades results to be strongly influenced by the <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> width, the insulating material distribution, the solar radiation intensity, the wall outer surface thermal resistance and the roughness of the slabs delimiting the <b>air</b> <b>duct...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this study, the {{vibration}} and acoustic {{interactions between the}} structure and the cavity inside the freezer cabinet were investigated. Thus, a set of numerical and experimental analyses were performed. In the numerical analysis, the acoustic characteristics of the freezer cavity were solved, and the mixed finite element method was then implemented to analyse the coupled behaviour of the cavity with the <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> using the Acoustic Fluid-Structure Interaction (AFSI) technique. In the experimental analyses, an acoustic modal analysis of the freezer cavity and a structural modal analysis of the <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> were performed for the validation process. A good agreement was obtained among the results. Thus, {{the accuracy of the}} numerical model was confirmed. The validated models were used for optimizing the design. To solve the noise generation mechanism inside the freezer cabinet, the noise primarily generated by the freezer fan unit was measured under normal working conditions of the refrigerator, and the resonance frequencies were obtained. This information was compared with the normal modes of the <b>air</b> <b>duct,</b> and the overlapping frequencies were identified. To reduce the interaction between the source and the structure, a few design modifications were applied to the <b>air</b> <b>duct.</b> Thus, the structural-borne noise radiating from the <b>air</b> <b>duct</b> into the freezer cavity was reduced...|$|R

25|$|To {{accurately}} {{predict what}} UV dose {{will be delivered}} to the target the UV intensity, adjusted for distance, coating and end of lamp life, will be multiplied by the exposure time. In static applications the exposure time can be as long as needed for an effective UV dose to be reached. In case of rapidly moving air, in AC <b>air</b> <b>ducts</b> for example, the exposure time is short so the UV intensity must be increased by introducing multiple UV lamps or even banks of lamps. Also, the UV installation must be located in a long straight duct section with the lamps perpendicular to the air flow to maximize the exposure time.|$|E
