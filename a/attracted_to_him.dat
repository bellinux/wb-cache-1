She later committed suicide and Reich blamed himself. If Kahn did have an abortion, Turner wrote, {{she was the first}} of four of Reich's partners to do so: his first wife had several, and his long-term partners Elsa Lindenberg and Ilse Ollendorf (his second wife) each had one at Reich's insistence.|$|E
5|$|Eva, a {{masseuse}} and the {{divorced mother}} of a teenage girl, attends a party in Pacific Palisades with her friends, married couple Will and Sarah. There she meets a poet, Marianne, and Will introduces Eva {{to one of his}} friends, Albert. After the party, Albert asks Will for Eva's number and, although hesitant since she is not physically <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> Eva agrees to go on a date with Albert, which goes well. Marianne contacts Eva for a massage, and after taking an immediate liking to one another they become friends.|$|E
5|$|Hélène Anders née Winnefeld – A young widow whom Aue meets through Thomas, {{while working}} in Berlin. When Max becomes seriously ill, she voluntarily comes to his {{apartment}} and nurses him back to health. While she is <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> as he initially expresses interest in her, due to his feelings for his sister, {{as well as his}} homosexual tendencies, he coldly turns her down and away. She leaves Berlin for her parents' house and writes, asking if he intends to marry her. She does not appear again in the novel. In the Greek mythology, Helen marries Menelaus, brother of Agamemnon.|$|E

5|$|With both of {{the leading}} {{candidates}} now discounted, Princess Victoria suggested Prince Louis of Hesse, a minor German royal, the nephew of the Grand Duke of Hesse. Princess Victoria {{had gone to the}} court of Hesse to inspect Louis's sister, Princess Anna, as a potential bride for her brother, the Prince of Wales. Although not favorably impressed with Princess Anna, she was impressed with Louis and his brother Prince Henry. Both were invited to Windsor Castle in 1860, ostensibly so they could watch the Ascot Races in the company of the royal family, but in reality, the visit was a chance for the Queen to inspect her potential son-in-law. The Queen admired both Louis and Henry, but noted how well Louis and Alice got along together. When the Hessian family departed, Louis requested Alice's photograph, and Alice made it clear that she was <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} month, Layla {{was moved}} to the ECW brand, debuting on 23 January 2007. She joined Brooke and Kelly Kelly to form Extreme Exposé. The trio performed a weekly dance segment on ECW, choreographed by Layla, for the next several months. In June 2007, The Miz {{was moved to}} the brand, prompting a storyline in which all three members of Extreme Exposé were <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> When Kelly shifted her attentions towards Balls Mahoney, Layla, Brooke, and Miz openly mocked her, turning Layla and Brooke into villainous characters in the process. On 1 November, Brooke was released from her WWE contract, and Extreme Exposé dissolved as a group, leaving Kelly and Layla to enter an ongoing rivalry with more active in-ring roles. They were on opposite sides of a 10-Diva tag team match at Survivor Series, which Layla's team lost. In December, Layla formed an alliance with Victoria, which expanded to include Lena Yada in January 2008, and the trio continued to feud with Kelly. At WrestleMania XXIV, Layla was a lumberjill for the Divas' tag team lumberjill match. The following month, Layla was part of the winning team in a six-on-six Divas match at the Backlash pay-per-view.|$|E
5|$|Mercer {{talks to}} Kate while driving, imagining her {{sitting in the}} back seat of the car, but she hangs up in jealousy when he {{mentions}} Joely for the first time. He arrives in Sacramento and finds the pet store where Arlen worked. The owner (Maura Tierney) asks Mercer to sing in her children's band, for which she plays as part of her probation. When he returns to the car, he finds somebody trying to break into it, only to discover that it is Kate. They spend the night at a hotel, but he leaves without her the next morning and catches a train to Los Angeles, California. With the help of a translator, he phones Arlen's last residence and learns from a Hispanic woman that Arlen is working at a hotel in Ensenada, Mexico. Mercer finally meets Arlen (Jsu Garcia) at the hotel in Ensenada, but Arlen assumes Mercer is just there for money. Enraged, Mercer tackles his brother to the ground and gets kicked off the premises. Kate later finds a bloody Mercer sitting on the side of a road and takes him to a hotel. She tells him that she let him take her car because she was <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and they have sex. The next day Mercer meets with Arlen again, more amicably, and tells him that he and Kate are driving to Louisiana to spread his mother's ashes.|$|E

25|$|In Nanterre, Cohn-Bendit was {{a leader}} in claims for more sexual freedom, with actions such as {{participating}} in the occupation of the girls' premises, interrupting the speech of a minister who was inaugurating a swimming pool in order to demand free access to the girls' dormitory. This contributed <b>to</b> <b>attracting</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> a lot of student supporters later {{to be called the}} '22 March Movement', a group characterised by a mixture of Marxist, sexual and anarchist ideology. In the autumn of 1967 rumours of his upcoming expulsion from the university led to a local students' strike, and his expulsion was cancelled. On 22 March 1968 students occupied the administrative offices, and the closing of the university on 2 May helped move the protests to downtown Paris.|$|R

25|$|The second reenactment is {{a legend}} {{similar to a}} Romeo and Juliet story which comes {{from the end of}} the 18th and {{beginning}} of the 19th century. The main protagonists are a bandit by the name of Agustín Lorenzo and the Corregidor’s Daughter. Lorenzo was a bandit who operated in what are now the states of Michoacán, State of Mexico, Guerrero, Morelos and Puebla. He fell madly in love with the corregidor’s (a public official) daughter but was forbidden to marry her because of social class. However, the daughter was <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and agreed to run away with him.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major change}} made was that Lois {{did not fall}} in love with just Superman, {{although}} she was <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> One reason was the revised nature of the Superman/Clark Kent relationship. In the original Silver Age stories, Superman had been the man who disguised himself as Clark Kent. In this newly revised concept, it was Clark Kent who lived a life in which his activity as Superman was decidedly secondary. Lois initially resented the rookie Clark Kent getting the story on Superman as his first piece when she had spent ages trying to get an interview. This sometimes ill-tempered rivalry remained the case until The Adventures of Superman #460–463 and Action Comics #650.|$|E

Louise's queen-regent Elisabeth Marie in 1668 founded a Regierungsrat at Oels. Caspar was, as a scholar, advising Louise and also helped {{in the design}} and construction of the Piasten-Gruft (tomb) in Liegnitz.

25|$|The two soon met. Even though Bernhardt {{was appalled}} by Damala's {{insolence}} towards her, she was nevertheless strongly <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and soon fell {{madly in love}} with the Greek. During that period, Bernhardt was about to begin her world tour; knowing that Damala was transferred in Saint Petersburg and interested in meeting him again, she decided to arrange a six-month stay in Russia, despite the fact she had previously – repeatedly – rejected offers of making appearances there. Indeed, she resided in Saint Petersburg for a few months, as an official guest of Emperor Alexander III of Russia, during which her romance with Damala flourished. The openness of their affair scandalized the social circles of the city and proved a common topic of discussion.|$|E
25|$|Three {{weeks after}} the murder of Ernest Miller, on September 24, Dahmer {{encountered}} a 22-year-old father of one named David Thomas at the Grand Avenue Mall and persuaded {{him to return to}} his apartment for a few drinks, with additional money on offer if he would pose for photographs. In his statement to police after his arrest, Dahmer stated that after giving Thomas a drink laden with sedatives, he did not feel <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> but was afraid to allow him to awake in case he would be angry over having been drugged. Therefore, he strangled him and dismembered the body—intentionally retaining no body parts whatsoever. Nonetheless, he did photograph the dismemberment process and retained these photographs, which would aid in Thomas' subsequent identification.|$|E
25|$|Ireland {{was born}} in Dartford, Kent to an {{unmarried}} teenage couple. Shortly after his birth, his father left him and his 17-year-old mother. He is not named on his birth certificate and Ireland did not know his identity. He was raised in poverty by his mother; they moved many times. In the early 1960s, she married. When she became pregnant, she put Ireland into care; he later returned to her. In 1966 she married another man. During the 1960s in Sheerness, Kent, Ireland was propositioned on three occasions and spied on once by men who were sexually <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> In his mid-teens, {{he was sent to}} borstal for theft and whilst there deliberately set fire to another resident's belongings. At age 17, Ireland was convicted of robbery. He escaped and was returned to borstal.|$|E

25|$|Pasquinel {{manages to}} return to St. Louis, then part of the Spanish Empire, with a Pawnee stone {{arrowhead}} in his spine. Lacking resources, he is introduced by a surgeon to Herman Bockweiss (Raymond Burr), a Bavarian immigrant merchant and silversmith, and goes to him for backing. Pasquinel later marries Bockweiss's daughter Lise (Sally Kellerman), who is <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> even though he keeps leaving for long periods in order to trade furs in unknown territory. The marriage is questionable from the start, as Pasquinel is rumored to have wives in various cities across North America. His financing secured, Pasquinel once again heads west and encounters Alexander McKeag (Richard Chamberlain), a Scottish-born trapper captured by the Pawnee. He gives the Pawnee chief a gun and arranges to free the red-bearded Scot. He also gives the chief some of Bockweiss' fine silver. The delighted Pawnee chief guarantees Pasquinel and McKeag safe travel through his land, and the two white men become partners and lifelong friends.|$|E

60|$|Possibly {{one of the}} {{greatest}} obstacles which lay in Jimmy's path toward academic honors was the fact that he possessed those qualities of character which <b>attracted</b> others <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> with the result that there was seldom an hour during the day that he had his room to himself.

500|$|According to critic Betsy Prioleau, Vision In Whites hero is {{a typical}} {{representation}} {{of one of the}} eight archetypes of a romance hero: the professor.

[...] Like most intellectual romance heroes, Carter is a [...] "sober good guy", and the heroine is <b>attracted</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> primarily for his mind. [...] In an unusual twist for a romance novel, however, the hero is the character who is ready for a commitment but must help the heroine overcome her fears.

Whether it were the King's habit of calling her 'la Belle Eurydice,' or because, as she said, he was 'si laid' and reminded her of old unhappy days of constraint, she did not like him, and had almost displeased her husband and his brother by saying so. She would gladly have avoided the gallantries of this day's ride by remaining with Philip at the inn; but not only was this impossible, but the peculiar ill-temper of concealed suffering made Philip drive her off whenever she approached him with inquiries; so that she was forced <b>to</b> leave <b>him</b> <b>to</b> his brother and Osbert, and ride forward between the King and the Duke, the last of whom she really liked.|$|R

50|$|Foreseeing {{potential}} {{future directions}} for a corporation or company {{is sometimes called}} ‘visioning’. Yet achieving a clear, shared vision in an organization is often difficult {{due to a lack}} of commitment to the new vision by some individuals in the organization, because it does not match reality as they see it. Those who support the new vision are termed ‘Cassandras’ - able to see what is going to happen, but not believed. Sometimes the name Cassandra is applied to those who can predict rises, falls, and particularly crashes on the global stock market, as happened with Warren Buffett, who repeatedly warned that the 1990s stock market surge was a bubble, <b>attracting</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> the title of 'Wall Street Cassandra'.
