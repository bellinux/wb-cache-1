40|$|Within {{the past}} ten years a variety of CNC {{manufacturers}} for <b>aspherical</b> <b>surfaces</b> have been established. The field of applications they are working for are very different. The way CNC manufacturers measure surfaces as well as the way they characterize the surface form deviation differs even more. Furthermore, {{there are a lot of}} customers being interested in using <b>aspherical</b> <b>surfaces</b> in their applications. In fact, aspherical lenses are not established as standard optical elements yet which is due to the fact that many users are not familiar with the implications of the use of <b>aspherical</b> <b>surfaces</b> with respect to the tolerancing of the optical system. Only few know how to specify an asphere, moreover, they differ about how to do that. The paper will give an insight in what is possible in aspherical manufacturing in terms of accuracy, efficiency, number of pieces per design and surface forms. An important issue is the development of deviation of form and slope in connection to prepolishing and correction polishing. Based on experiences of the manufacture of more than 500 different aspherical designs with diameters ranging from 3 - 200 mm, the paper is going to give an insight into production practices. Finally, there will be a general overview on what could be done and what needs to be done in order to unify the different ways of tolerancing of <b>aspherical</b> <b>surfaces...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Aspherical</b> <b>surfaces</b> are an {{important}} technology in optical instruments. Until now, only improvements in form accuracy and <b>surface</b> roughness of <b>aspherical</b> <b>surfaces</b> have been investigated. However, when the surface roughness becomes low, the small waviness of the surface becomes marked. This small waviness is termed “Nano-topography. ” Nano-topography causes grinding marks and reduces the accuracy of an optical instrument. Nano-topography {{is caused by the}} vibration of a grinding wheel during the manufacture of the surface. This paper will reveal how a rubber-bonded grinding wheel has been developed to absorb that vibration. The dressing of the grinding wheel was also investigated. As a result, it is possible to eliminate the generation of nano-topography...|$|R

The objects of research are two types of equations for higher order aspherical surfaces description used in different software for optical systems design (SАRО, OPAL, ZEMAX, CODE-V, etc.) and dependent on z-coordinate or on a radial coordinate on the surface. Conversion from one type of equations to another is considered in view of application in different software for optical systems design. Methods. The subject matter of the method lies in usage of mean square method approximation for recalculation of high-order <b>aspherical</b> <b>surface.</b> Iterative algorithm for recalculation is presented giving the possibility to recalculate coefficients for different types of equations with required accuracy.

40|$|The {{design of}} an optical element profile with {{specified}} transmission function {{for a given}} incident wave is of fundamental concern in optical design. A well-known example is the design of an <b>aspherical</b> <b>surface</b> in order to realize a spherical phase-only transmission. Various wave-optical system design methods lead to transmission functions as a first step. Then, often the thin-element approximation is applied in a second step to obtain an element structure with the desired transmission. However, if the refraction at the optical interface cannot be neglected, the thin-element approximation is not valid. In this case, a higher version of the local plane-interface approximation {{can be used for}} the element structure design. An algorithm for this model is introduced and its characteristics are discussed for the example of a non-paraxial Gaussian-to-tophat beam shaping element...|$|E

40|$|Self-pumped phase-conjugate mirrors (SPPCM) on {{the base}} of photorefractive {{crystals}} are able to produce the phase-conjugate replica of an incoming wave. That is within certain limits independent of the incoming wave front. One conclusion of that is the possibility of aberration compensation in interferometers. Hence the application of SPPCM offers new possibilities for interferometric tests, especially in fields where classical methods reach their limits. We have built up an phase-shifting interferometer for testing cylindrical and <b>aspherical</b> <b>surfaces</b> incorporating a SPPCM. The optics for generating the wave front adapted to the surface under test is placed in the entrance arm of the interferometer.

Similar calculations are provided for products of surfaces, and show a close analogy with the Quillen–Lichtenbaum conjectures in algebraic K–theory. The proofs utilize Tyler Lawson’s work on the Bott map in deformation K–theory, and rely heavily on Yang-Mills theory and gauge theory. 1...|$|E

40|$|A {{refractive}} {{laser beam}} shaper typically consists of either two plano-aspheric lenses or one thick lens with two <b>aspherical</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Ray mapping {{is a general}} optical design technique for irradiance reshaping based on geometric optics. Although ray mapping, in principle, allows generating any rotational-symmetric irradiance profile, in the literature this technique is mainly used to transform a Gaussian irradiance profile to a uniform rotational-symmetric profile. For more complex profiles, especially with low intensity in the inner region (such as annular profiles), a high sampling rate is required to ensure an accurate calculation of the surfaces. In practice, the high sampling rate increases the numerical effort to calculate the <b>aspherical</b> <b>surfaces</b> and the simulation time to verify the design considerably. In this work, we evaluate different sampling approaches and surface construction methods. This allows us to propose and demonstrate a comprehensive numerical approach to efficiently design refractive laser beam shapers to generate rotational-symmetric collimated beams with annular irradiance profiles. Ray tracing analysis for several annular irradiance profiles demonstrates the excellent performance of the designed lenses and the versatility of our design procedure. status: publishe...|$|R
