5|$|Nine of Milwaukee Avenue's houses {{had to be}} {{destroyed}} due to their decrepit conditions and a tenth was moved elsewhere. In the spaces where these houses once stood, townhomes were built, mirroring {{the style of the}} original houses. The rest of the houses got indoor plumbing, new basements, improved woodwork and porches added on. Additionally, a pedestrian mall was built down the center of Milwaukee Avenue to replace <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> <b>street.</b> The Avenue is now bike and pedestrian friendly, and cars are prohibited.|$|E
5|$|M-13/M-84 {{crosses the}} west channel of the Saginaw River near the Ted Putz Nature Area to Middle Ground island. The highway {{continues}} over the east channel on the Lafayette Avenue Bridge, a drawbridge, to Lafayette Avenue {{on the eastern}} bank of the river. At the intersection with Broadway Street, M-13 turns southward, and M-84 continues eastward two more blocks. Turning north on Garfield Street, the highway runs parallel to the river through a residential area. North of the 14th Street intersection, Garfield Street curves northeasterly into Washington Avenue, passing {{to the east of}} an industrial complex on the river. At the intersection with McKinley Street, <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> <b>street,</b> M-84 meets the eastbound direction of M-25 and BS I-75. One block north, M-84 terminates at the intersection with 7th Street, which carries westbound M-25 and BS I-75; both intersections also mark BS I-75's terminus immediately east of the Veterans Memorial Bridge.|$|E
5|$|NY61 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY384 (Buffalo Avenue) on the industrial {{banks of the}} Niagara River in eastern Niagara Falls. The route, named Hyde Park Boulevard for its entire length, heads north initially as a city-maintained, undivided four-lane highway; after two blocks, the roadway widens and becomes maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation. NY61 continues onward through the densely populated neighborhoods of Niagara Falls to Packard Road, where the route begins to parallel Gill Creek, a small stream leading south to the Niagara River. After five blocks, NY61 intersects with Ferry Avenue, <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> <b>street</b> carrying southbound U.S. Route62 (US62), {{in the area of}} the Niagara Falls Courthouse. NY61 intersects with northbound US62 three blocks later at Walnut Avenue.

5|$|MD 213 enters Elkton at the {{intersection}} with US 40 (Pulaski Highway). Past this intersection, the route heads northwest on Bridge Street, passing through commercial areas. The route intersects Main Street, which continues east of MD 213 as <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> <b>street</b> eastbound. Past Main Street, the road continues north and passes over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor before intersecting MD 545 (Elkton Boulevard). MD 213 continues past commercial areas {{to the west and}} residential areas to the east before its intersection with MD 279 (Elkton Road/Newark Avenue). Past the MD 279 intersection, the route leaves Elkton and becomes Singerly Road, which continues past residences. MD 213 enters a mix of woods and farms and passes over Interstate 95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway) and CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision within a short distance of each other. It continues through a mix of farms and residences before the road reaches the Leeds roundabout with Leeds Road. Past the roundabout, the route resumes north, intersecting MD 273 (Telegraph Road) in Fair Hill west of the Fair Hill Training Center, where the Atlantic to Appalachians Scenic Byway leaves MD 213 and heads west along MD 273. From here, MD 213 continues northwest and west as Lewisville Road through a mix of rural areas and residences before ending at the Pennsylvania border. Here, the road continues north as PA 841 into Lewisville, intersecting the southern terminus of PA 472 just north of the state line.|$|E
5|$|There {{was nothing}} to link Murat or his friends to the disappearance, and Murat's arguido status was lifted on 21 July 2008 when the case was archived. In April 2008 he {{received}} £600,000 in out-of-court settlements for libel in what The Observer said was {{the largest number of}} separate libel actions brought in the UK by the same person in relation to one issue; his friends received £100,000 each. In July 2014, during Operation Grange, one of those friends was questioned again as a witness, this time by the Polícia Judiciária on behalf of Scotland Yard. In December that year Murat and his wife were questioned, also on behalf of Scotland Yard, along with eight others. In 2017 Murat's mother, Jenny Murat, added her voice to those who had witnessed suspicious events around 5A that night: she told the BBC that she had driven past apartment 5A that night, and had seen a young woman in a plum-coloured top behaving suspiciously just outside it, information she said she passed to the police at the time. She also said she had seen a small brown rental car speeding toward the apartment, driving the wrong way down <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> <b>street.</b>|$|E

The Boulevard du port aux filles will become <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> <b>street,</b> except for buses.|$|E
25|$|The Soviets, who {{encouraged}} and partly {{carried out the}} expulsions, offered little cooperation with humanitarian efforts, thereby requiring the Americans and Britons to absorb the expellees in their zones of occupation. In contradiction with the Potsdam Agreements, the Soviets neglected their obligation to provide supplies for the expellees. In Potsdam, {{it was agreed that}} 15% of all equipment dismantled in the Western zones—especially from the metallurgical, chemical and machine manufacturing industries—would be transferred to the Soviets in return for food, coal, potash (a basic material for fertiliser), timber, clay products, petroleum products, etc. The Western deliveries started in 1946, but {{this turned out to be}} <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> <b>street.</b> The Soviet deliveries—desperately needed to provide the expellees with food, warmth, and basic necessities and to increase agricultural production in the remaining cultivation area—did not materialize. Consequently, the US stopped all deliveries on 3 May 1946, while the expellees from the areas under Soviet rule were deported to the West until the end of 1947.|$|E
25|$|In one {{incident}} in 2014, the city delayed mailing out the violations {{for a few}} months, causing violators to receive multiple tickets that added up {{to as much as}} $7,000. According to one commentator for The New York Times, this did not serve the purpose of the cameras, which were to educate drivers and keep the bus lanes empty of cars. The city agreed to review the violations and to keep each driver liable only for the first violation they received. There was a bus lane camera on Staten Island that gave tickets to drivers who failed to make an immediate right turn, even though {{it was not possible to}} make the right turn, since the next possible turn was a private driveway or <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> <b>street</b> that had traffic running in the opposite direction. One retired police officer showed that his ticket was withheld by the judge and the appeals system. The city eventually turned off the camera.|$|E

25|$|Although not {{specifically}} {{linked to the}} use of warning beacons, the police, fire brigade and ambulance services (and in certain cases, the blood services and bomb disposal units, but not the other emergency services listed above) may also choose to allow their drivers to claim legal exemptions from certain motoring regulations, such as being able to treat a red traffic light as a give way sign, exceeding the speed limit, passing the wrong side of a keep left/right sign, driving in a bus lane, or parking in restricted areas. They may not, however, ignore ‘no entry’ signs, drive the wrong way down <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> <b>street</b> or cross a solid white line {{in the middle of the}} road (other than the same exceptions granted everyone else, for example to pass a stationary vehicle). In reality some drivers will disobey other laws at their professional judgement but they do so without any automatic protection from the law. Some services, such as HM coastguard do not allow all their staff to claim all the exemptions available to them.|$|E
25|$|MD 129 {{begins at}} Franklin Street, the {{westbound}} direction of US 40, in the Seton Hill neighborhood of Baltimore.

25|$|Barrington had flu at {{the start}} of the season, made a {{depressing}} pair against Derbyshire and withdrew from the First Test due to back trouble, which Australia won. He returned for the Second Test at Lord's and made a patient 75 after having retired hurt on 61 with a broken finger from Garth McKenzie. This stood him in good stead that evening when he turned the wrong way down <b>a</b> <b>one-way</b> <b>street</b> and was stopped by the police as after enquiries into his finger he was allowed to proceed. The Queen also asked about his finger when the teams were presented to her, as is traditional at Lord's. In freakish weather conditions including several stops for rain and a hailstorm that turned the ground white Australia were out for 78, but they survived the follow on as the weather forced a draw. The Third Test at Edgbaston was Cowdrey's 100th and he celebrated with a century, but Barrington was caught lbw by Eric Freeman and the game was another rained-off draw. Both Cowdrey and Bill Lawry we ill for the Fourth Test at Headingley, and the stand in captains settled for a third successive draw, with Barrington making 49 and 46 not out. Needing to win at the Oval to share the series the slow-scoring Barrington was dropped, but England won the Fifth Test with five minutes to spare. Barrington was named for the tour of South Africa in 1968–69, but this was cancelled when Basil d'Oliveira was belatedly included and the South African government refused to allow him to play.|$|E
