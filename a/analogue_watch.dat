40|$|The {{timing of}} {{electron}} release in strong-field double ionization poses great challenges both for conceptual definition and for conducting experimental measurements. Here we present coincidence momentum {{measurements of the}} doubly charged ion and of the two electrons arising from double ionization of argon using elliptically polarized laser pulses. Based on a semi-classical model, the ionization times are calculated from the measured electron momenta across a large intensity range. This paper discusses how this method provides timings on a coarse and on a fine scale, similar to the hour and the minute hand of a clock. We found that the ionization {{time of the first}} electron is in good agreement with the simulation, whereas the ionization of the second electron occurs significantly earlier than predicted. Among all themethods used tomeasure time, one of themostfundamental is to measure the angle of a rotating hand,such as is done on an <b>analogue</b> <b>watch</b> face. This principle can be employed in strong-field ionization using laser pulses with close-to-circular polarization. In the attoclock the rotating electric field vector is used to deflect photo-ionized electrons, such that the instant of ionization is mapped to the final angle of themomentum, similar to the minute hand of a clock. The attoclock technique is based on the definition of ‘time ’ by ‘counting cycles’ 1, 2. During one period the watch hand completes one cycle, such that measurin...|$|E

5000|$|The dials and markers on {{the watch}} face and bezel {{have to be}} legible under water and in low light conditions. An {{indication}} that the watch is running in total darkness also has to be present.For easy legibility most diving watches have high contrasting, non-cluttered dials and markers with a large, easily identifiable minute hand. The markers for 3, 6, 9 and (especially) 12 o'clock on the watch face and the zero marker on the bezel of <b>analogue</b> diver's <b>watches</b> are usually conspicuously styled to prevent disorientation induced read out errors. A styling of the hands where no hand can temporarily totally overlay and hence obscure the position of another hand is also desirable to promote constant legibility and prevent read out errors.For low light conditions luminous phosphorescent non-toxic strontium aluminate based lume pigments marketed under brand names like Super-LumiNova or NoctiLumina and tritium based self-powered lighting devices called [...] "gaseous tritium light source" [...] (GTLS) are applied on the dials and markers. On digital diving watches, lighted displays are used for legibility under low light conditions.|$|R

A blurred picture identification task showed that neutral objects that preceded traumatic pictures in the stories were subsequently more readily identified than those that had preceded neutral stories, indicating enhanced priming. There was also an evaluative conditioning effect in that participants disliked neutral objects that had preceded traumatic pictures more.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Patients' {{recall of}} {{provided}} information during bad news consultations is poor. According to the attentional narrowing hypothesis, the emotional arousal {{caused by the}} bad news might be responsible for this hampered information processing. Because affective communication {{has proven to be}} effective in tempering patients' emotional reactions, the current study used an experimental design to explore whether physician's affective communication in bad news consultations decreases patients' anxiety and uncertainty and improves information recall. METHOD: Two scripted video-vignettes of a bad news consultation were used in which the physician's verbal communication was manipulated (standard vs. affective condition). Fifty healthy women (i. e., <b>analogue</b> patients) randomly <b>watched</b> 1 of the 2 videos. The effect of communication on participants' anxiety, uncertainty, and recall was assessed by self-report questionnaires. Additionally, a moderator analysis was performed. RESULTS: Affective communication reduced anxiety (p =. 01) and uncertainty (p =. 04), and improved recall (p =. 05), especially for information about prognosis (p =. 04) and, to some extent, for treatment options (p =. 07). The moderating effect of (reduced) anxiety and uncertainty on recall could not be confirmed and showed a trend for uncertainty. CONCLUSION: Physicians' affective communication can temper patients' anxiety and uncertainty during bad news consultations, and enhance their ability to recall medical information. The reduction of anxiety and uncertainty could not explain patients' enhanced recall, which leaves the underlying mechanism unspecified. Our findings underline the importance of addressing patients' emotions and provide empirical support to incorporate this in clinical guidelines and recommendations.

40|$|When {{talking about}} the digital age, the {{digitisation}} process of the television landscape catches the eye. Dependent on the specific characteristics (geography, existing infrastructure) of each Member State, the transformation from analogue to digital television in Europe has been initiated {{from one of the}} traditional transmission channels (terrestrial, satellite or cable). Digitisation has now reached a crucial phase, i. e. the replacement of the analogue terrestrial system by its digital equivalent. The European Commission has urged all Member States to switchover from analogue to digital terrestrial television by 2012. This analogue switch-off has consequences for both users and providers of television services, particularly for public service broadcasters (PSB). This paper focuses on the switch-off plans and strategies in Europe and assesses the implications of the digital switch-off, especially with regards to the role of public service media. After a brief literature review on public service broadcasting in the digital era, we focus on one principle that might be at stake when analogue terrestrial television is to be switched-off: the principle of universality. A substantial part of the citizens who watch television by means of an analogue antenna signal, risk to be excluded or neglected after the analogue switch-off. In the light of democratic and social ideals, European governments must be aware of this and must develop suitable alternatives and communication campaigns. Policy makers are confronted with a duality in the highly competitive digital environment: they must join the digital era by offering additional services via the new digital platforms while on the other hand they are supposed to keep television available for all citizens, including those who <b>watch</b> (<b>analogue)</b> terrestrial television. In this context, the Flemish Government – who scheduled the switchover to digital terrestrial television in 2008 – ordered a study on the profile and needs of analogue television viewers in Flanders. The study, of which the findings are presented in this paper, used a multi-methodological design (a survey supplemented by focus group interviews) to identify the characteristics, media behaviour and needs and expectations of Flemish analogue antenna viewers. On the basis of our research, we can conclude firstly that there are three types of analogue antenna viewers: the primary antenna viewer, the secondary antenna viewer at home, and the secondary antenna viewer in a holiday home/second residence. Making a distinction between these three segments clearly has its implications when it comes to communication. Especially the primary antenna viewer has a distinct opinion. Secondly, the results demonstrate that the antenna viewers are badly informed about the upcoming analogue switch-off, which may lead to a negative attitude and may impede a smooth transition. Lastly, antenna viewers are rather conservative viewers: they wish to keep on watching television on the same place, with the same program offer. Moreover, digital terrestrial television is their most preferred alternative...|$|R
