40|$|Variable camber <b>actuator</b> <b>assemblies</b> {{broaden the}} range of speeds at which lift to drag {{performance}} is maximized for slotted flap wings. Lift is improved over {{a broader range of}} cruising speeds by varying wing camber with rotational flap movements that do not introduce wing slots and induced drag.

The forward flaps rotate about flap pivots with their rotational displacement controlled by variable camber <b>actuator</b> <b>assemblies</b> located between the forward flaps and the forward flange links. Rear flaps are held relative to the forward flaps by rear flap linkage assemblies which may act independently from the forward flap linkage assemblies and the variable camber <b>actuator</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Wing camber is varied by rotating the flaps with the variable camber <b>actuator</b> <b>assemblies</b> while the flaps are in a deployed or tucked position. Rotating the flaps in a tucked position does not introduce significant wing surface discontinuities, and reduces aircraft fuel consumption on most flight profiles...|$|R
40|$|Evidence of {{propellant}} leakage across ball-valve {{shaft seals}} {{has been noted}} during the disassembly of five flight engines and one test engine at the NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, White Sands Test Facility. Based on data collected during the disassembly of these five engines, the consequences of propellant leakage across the ball-valve shaft seals {{can be divided into}} four primary areas of concern: Damage to the ball-valve pinion shafts, damage to sleeved bearings inside the ball-valve and <b>actuator</b> <b>assemblies,</b> degradation of the synthetic rubber o-rings used in the <b>actuator</b> <b>assemblies,</b> and corrosion and degradation to the interior of the <b>actuator</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The exact time at which leakage across the ball-valve shaft seals occurs has not been determined, however, the leakage most likely occurs during engine firings when, depending on the specification used, ball-valve cavity pressures range as high as 453 to 550 psia. This potential pressure range for the ball-valve cavities greatly exceeds the acceptance leakage test pressure of 332 psia. Since redesign and replacement of the ball-valve shaft seals is unlikely, the near term solution to prevent damage that occurs from shaft-seal leakage is to implement a routine overhaul and maintenance program for engines in the fleet. Recommended repair, verification, and possible preventative maintenance measures are discussed in the paper...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper will}} show a {{conceptual}} new material platform for dielectric elastomer actuators (DEA). The working principle of DEAs is based to {{the displacement of}} a flexible insulating dielectric which is placed between two electrodes. If an electrical voltage is applied, an electrostatic pressure will be generated, which forces the elastic material to stretch. State of the art actuators exhibit non-flexible metallic or graphite electrodes. The difference in flexibility leads to material incompatibilities and reduces the durability and long-term stability of <b>actuator</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The new material platform consists of only one basic polymer for all layers. Ceramic fillers were used to obtain a higher permittivity of the dielectric layer. The electrode layer was modified with nanoscale fillers like Carbon Nanotubes (CNT) to reach the needed specific conductivity.

Accordingly, the prediction of structural performance from initial linear-elastic behaviour to collapse is essential to assess the effectiveness of new design methods and the implementation of new retrofitting strategies. Although there has been much advancement in numerical methods, experimental observations remain critical for better understanding and predicting a structure's response. The Multi-Axis Substructure Testing (MAST) system has been developed to expand the capabilities of experimental testing for three-dimensional simulation of extreme loads on critical components of large and complex structural systems. The MAST system uses eight high-capacity hydraulic actuators and a sophisticated 6 -DOF mixed-mode control system that enables simultaneous application of multi-directional continuously varying states of deformation or load to structural components.

The evolution of end-effector design has traded off between simplistic single-taskers and highly complex multi-function grippers. For future space operations, launch payload weight and {{the wide range of}} desired tasks necessitate a highly dexterous design with strength and manipulation capabilities matching those of the suited astronaut using EVA tools.

40|$|As {{environmental}} awareness increases, cleaner burning fuels are desired {{for use in}} power plants. Fuels such hydrogen, methane and syngas are cleaner and leaner burning, which causes combustion instabilities. The Active Combustion Throttle (ACT) project {{is sponsored by the}} Department of Energy's National Energy Technologies Laboratory (NETL) and aspires to create a valve capable of modulating the flow of fuel administered to gas turbines by +/- 10 %. Development of such a valve will require an integrated valve and actuator design that can withstand the harsh environment of a power plant as well have a closed loop feedback control system in order to avoid combustion instabilities. In this thesis, an in-depth survey of current actuator and valve technologies revealed there are not any commercially available integrated valve assemblies capable of performing such a task. Two valve designs and one actuator design were devised to meet a list of specifications from NETL. Both valve designs as well as the actuator design underwent a rigorous battery of electromagnetic, stress, thermal, finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analyses using contemporary mechanical, electrical and physical theory and commercially available computer-aided design (CAD) programs. Prototype valve designs were designed, machined, cold flow tested and approved for further prototype design and testing. Initial cold flow testing revealed that both valve designs had linear ranges, were quick opening and demonstrated adequate flow coefficients (Cv). Further testing will continue to refine the valve designs in preparation for creating integrated valve/actuator assemblies for more aggressive testing. The primary contribution of this thesis are the two valve designs and actuator design that have thus far proven to be capable of fulfilling the requirements set forth by NETL for the ACT project. Further research and analyses of these designs will provide more robust prototype valve and <b>actuator</b> <b>assemblies</b> for eventual live testing at NETL. The framework provided by this thesis will allow those involved with the project to make changes to the current designs as needed since the same analyses can be more efficiently executed for subsequent changes throughout the remaining stages of development...|$|R
