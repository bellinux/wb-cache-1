40|$|The proper {{performance}} of a <b>post-mortem</b> <b>inspection</b> requires a good knowledge of the anatomy of the slaughtered animal species. The aim of this chapter is to offer an inspective {{point of view of}} the anatomical structures perceived during a <b>post-mortem</b> <b>inspection</b> and to discuss the available inspective tools. In particular, the chapter focuses on the inspective anatomy of pigs, large and small ruminants and poultry. To describe the anatomy of pigs, ruminants and poultry, the inspective anatomy has been divided into the anatomy of the head, anatomy of viscera, anatomy of the carcass and anatomy of poultry. The anatomical characteristics of pig, bovine and small ruminants are similar and are discussed together in the first three sections of the chapter, while the anatomy of poultry is discussed separately...|$|R

40|$|Meat {{inspection}} now {{incorporates a}} more risk-based approach for protecting human health against meat-borne biological hazards. Official <b>post-mortem</b> meat <b>inspection</b> of pigs {{has shifted to}} visual meat inspection. The official veterinarian decides on additional <b>post-mortem</b> <b>inspection</b> procedures, such as incisions and palpations. The decision is based on declarations in the food chain information (FCI), antemortem <b>inspection</b> and <b>post-mortem</b> <b>inspection.</b> However, a smooth slaughter and inspection process is essential. Therefore, one {{should be able to}} assess prior to slaughter which pigs are suitable for visual meat inspection only, and which need more profound inspection procedures. This study evaluates the usability of the FCI provided by pig producers and considered the possibility for risk ranking of incoming slaughter batches according to the previous meat inspection data and the current FCI. Eighty-five slaughter batches comprising 8954 fattening pigs were randomly selected at a slaughterhouse that receives animals from across Finland. The mortality rate, the FCI and the meat inspection results for each batch were obtained. The current FCI alone provided insufficient and inaccurate information for risk ranking purposes for meat inspection. The partial condemnation rate for a batch was best predicted by the partial condemnation rate calculated for all the pigs sent for slaughter from the same holding in the previous year (p < 0. 001) and by prior information on cough declared in the current FCI (p = 0. 02) statement. Training and information to producers are needed to make the FCI reporting procedures more accurate. Historical meat inspection data on pigs slaughtered from the same holdings and well-chosen symptoms/signs for reporting, {{should be included in the}} FCI to facilitate the allocation of pigs for visual inspection. The introduced simple scoring system can be easily used for additional information for directing batches to appropriate meat inspection procedures. To control the main biological public health hazards related to pork, serological surveillance should be done and the information obtained from analyses should be used as part of the FCI.

40|$|A risk ranking process {{identified}} Salmonella spp. and pathogenic verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) {{as current}} high-priority biological hazards for meat inspection of bovine animals. As these hazards are not detected by traditional meat inspection, a meat safety assurance {{system for the}} farm-to-chilled carcass continuum using a risk-based approach was proposed. Key elements of the system are risk-categorisation of slaughter animals for high-priority biological hazards based on improved food chain information, as well as risk-categorisation of slaughterhouses according to their capability to control those hazards. Omission of palpation and incision during <b>post-mortem</b> <b>inspection</b> for animals subjected to routine slaughter may decrease spreading and cross-contamination with the high-priority biological hazards. For chemical hazards, dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls were ranked as being of high potential concern; all other substances were ranked as of medium or lower concern. Monitoring programmes for chemical hazards should be more flexible {{and based on the}} risk of occurrence, taking into account the completeness and quality of the food chain information supplied and the ranking of chemical substances, which should be regularly updated to include new hazards. Control programmes across the food chain, national residue control programmes, feed control and monitoring of environmental contaminants should be better integrated. Meat inspection is a valuable tool for surveillance and monitoring of animal health and welfare conditions. Omission of palpation and incision would reduce detection effectiveness for bovine tuberculosis and would {{have a negative impact on}} the overall surveillance system especially in officially tuberculosis free countries. The detection effectiveness for bovine cysticercosis, already low with the current meat inspection system, would result in a further decrease, if palpation and incision are removed. Extended use of food chain information could compensate for some, but not all, the information on animal health and welfare lost if only visual <b>post-mortem</b> <b>inspection</b> is applied...|$|R
40|$|A risk ranking process {{identified}} Toxoplasma gondii and pathogenic verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) as {{the most}} relevant biological hazards for meat inspection of sheep and goats. As these are not detected by traditional meat inspection, a meat safety assurance system using risk-based interventions was proposed. Further studies are required on T. gondii and pathogenic VTEC. If new information confirms these hazards as a high risk to public health from meat from sheep or goats, setting targets at carcass level should be considered. Other elements of the system are risk-categorisation of flocks/herds based on improved Food Chain Information (FCI), classification of abattoirs according to their capability to reduce faecal contamination, and use of improved process hygiene criteria. It is proposed to omit palpation and incision from <b>post-mortem</b> <b>inspection</b> in animals subjected to routine slaughter. For chemical hazards, dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls were ranked as being of high potential concern. Monitoring programmes for chemical hazards should be more flexible {{and based on the}} risk of occurrence, taking into account FCI, which should be expanded to reflect the extensive production systems used, and the ranking of chemical substances, which should be regularly updated and include new hazards. Control programmes across the food chain, national residue control plans, feed control and monitoring of environmental contaminants should be better integrated. Meat inspection is a valuable tool for surveillance and monitoring of animal health and welfare conditions. Omission of palpation and incision would reduce detection effectiveness for tuberculosis and fasciolosis at animal level. Surveillance of tuberculosis at the slaughterhouse in small ruminants should be improved and encouraged, as this is in practice the only surveillance system available.

40|$|The {{presence}} {{and severity of}} lung lesions recorded post-mortem is commonly used as an indicator to assess the prevalence of respiratory problems in batches of bovines. In {{the context of a}} welfare monitoring based on on-farm measures, the recording of clinical signs on calves at the farm would be more convenient than the recording of lung lesions at slaughter. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the relationship between clinical respiratory signs at farm and post-mortem analyses of lung lesions observed at slaughter in veal calves. If clinical signs were a good predictor of lung lesions it could be possible to integrate only those measures in a welfare monitoring system. One-hundred-and-seventy-four batches of calves were observed 3 times: at 3 and 13 weeks after arrival of the calves at the unit and at 2 weeks before slaughter. For each batch a maximum of 300 calves was observed and the proportions of calves showing abnormal breathing, nasal discharge and coughing were recorded. <b>Post-mortem</b> <b>inspection</b> was carried out on a sample of lungs belonging to calves from the observed batches. Each examined lung was classified according to a 4 -point scale for pneumonia from healthy lung (score 0) to severe lesions (score 3). The clinical signs recorded infra vitam were significantly correlated with moderate and severe lung lesions for observations at 13 weeks and 2 weeks before slaughter and the level of the correlation was highly variable (rsp from 0. 16 to 0. 40). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were created and the area under the curves showed that batches with a high proportion of lungs with moderate or severe lesions could not be accurately detected by the three clinical signs of respiratory disorders. These results suggest that both clinical signs and <b>post-mortem</b> <b>inspection</b> of lung lesions must be included in a welfare monitoring schemes for veal calve...|$|R

40|$|Taenia saginata {{cysticercosis}} {{is one of}} the {{zoonotic diseases}} that threaten food safety and food security, particularly in developing countries. A cross-sectional study was conducted to estimate the prevalence and cyst distribution in infected cattle, and food safety implications of Taenia saginata cysticercosis in Harari People’s National Regional State, eastern Ethiopia. <b>Post-mortem</b> <b>inspection</b> of carcasses and organs of slaughtered cattle in Harar Municipal Abattoir, cyst viability tests and interviews with randomly selected meat consumers were undertaken. The <b>post-mortem</b> <b>inspection</b> showed that of the 898 local zebu cattle slaughtered for human consumption and examined for the presence of cysticerci of T. saginata, 19. 7 % (177 / 898; 95 % CI = 17. 2 – 22. 5) harboured at least one cyst in the muscles or organs inspected. Of the edible anatomical sites with cysticerci, shoulder muscle, liver and heart together represented 65. 4 %, 66. 0 % and 65. 4 % respectively of relative prevalence, total cyst count and cyst viability. These edible sites are preferred above others by local people for preparation and consumption of raw or inadequately cooked meat dishes that are locally served as kurt, kitffo and dullet. The interviews revealed that among the 300 study participants, 182 (60. 7 %) had been infected by taeniosis at least once during the previous year and of these 99. 0 % had eaten raw or undercooked beef, the majority (88. 3 %) obtained from butchers assumed to provide officially inspected meat that was fit for consumption. This indicated that existing meat inspection processes were inadequate to prevent carcasses infected with T. saginata cysticerci from reaching consumers. The high prevalence of viable cysts in the edible parts of beef together with the widespread consumption of raw or undercooked beef indicated the importance of T. saginata cysticercosis as a food safety problem in eastern Ethiopia. The promotion of policies to upgrade existing meat inspection procedures and public education to ensure effective prevention of T. saginata taeniosis in humans were recommended...|$|R

Histopathologically, the tumor was comprised of immature mesenchymal stroma and a variety of mature tissue elements of mesodermal and ectodermal origin. In addition, there were multiple indistinguishable tissue elements, which showed no malignant cytological features but were unidentifiable as to corresponding embryological layer of origin. These heterogeneous teratoma tissues consisted of a variety of glandular, cystic, duct-like, and tubular structures, some of which exhibited a lining by a mixture of both keratinizing/non-keratinizing stratified squamous epithelial cells and cuboidal/columnar epithelial cells.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the feasibility of}} using information about the health and management of lambs on farms to predict the risk of gross abnormalities at <b>post-mortem</b> meat <b>inspection,</b> 6732 lambs from 30 different farms in Great Britain were followed through to slaughter in 1995 / 6. The farm-level data were collected during farm visits {{at the beginning of}} the study. Routine meat inspection findings for the lambs were obtained from the 10 participating abattoirs. The most common abnormalities found during <b>post-mortem</b> <b>inspection</b> were pneumonia/pleurisy (53 % of cohorts), lungworm (40 %), abscesses (30 %), liver fluke (27 %) and nephritis/nephrosis (27 %). The farm-level risk factors associated with abnormalities at slaughter varied with the type of lesion. The most significant risk factor was the age of the lambs at slaughter. Lambs slaughtered at an older age were more likely to have an abnormality, especially pneumonia, abscesses and liver fluke. After age, environmental factors appeared to be better predictors of those cohorts that would have lesions at slaughter than health and disease control variables. However, a much larger study would be required to identify a set of farm-level factors that adequately discriminated between lambs with high and low risks of lesion at slaughter. At the end of the study, the farmers were informed of the meat inspection findings for their lambs and a third indicated that they would improve their animal husbandry as a result of the information...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDiagnosis and {{detection}} of Echinococcus granulosus (sensu lato) infection in animals {{is a prerequisite}} for epidemiological studies and surveillance of echinococcosis in endemic, re-emergent or emergent transmission zones. Advances in diagnostic approaches for definitive hosts and livestock, however, have not progressed equally over the last 20 years. Development of laboratory based diagnostics for canids using coproantigen ELISA and also coproPCR, have had a huge impact on epidemiological studies and more recently on surveillance during hydatid control programmes. In contrast, diagnosis of cystic echinococcosis (CE) in livestock still relies largely on conventional <b>post-mortem</b> <b>inspection,</b> despite a relatively low diagnostic sensitivity especially in early infections, as current serodiagnostics do not provide a sufficiently specific and sensitive practical pre-mortem alternative. As a result, testing of dog faecal samples by coproantigen ELISA, often combined with mass ultrasound screening programmes for human CE, has been the preferred approach for monitoring and surveillance in resource-poor endemic areas and during control schemes. In this article we review the current options and approaches for diagnosis of E. granulosus infection in definitive and animal intermediate hosts (including applications in non-domesticated species) and make conclusions and recommendations for further improvements in diagnosis for use in epidemiological studies and surveillance schemes...|$|R
40|$|A risk ranking process {{identified}} Trichinella spp. as {{the most}} relevant biological hazard {{in the context of}} meat inspection of domestic solipeds. Without a full and reliable soliped traceability system, it is considered that either testing all slaughtered solipeds for Trichinella spp., or inactivation meat treatments (heat or irradiation) should be used to maintain the current level of safety. With regard to general aspects of current meat inspection practices, the use of manual techniques during current <b>post-mortem</b> soliped meat <b>inspection</b> may increase microbial cross-contamination, and is considered to have a detrimental effect on the microbiological status of soliped carcass meat. Therefore, the use of visual-only inspection is suggested for “non-suspect” solipeds. For chemical hazards, phenylbutazone and cadmium were ranked as being of high potential concern. Monitoring programmes for chemical hazards should be more flexible and based on the risk of occurrence, taking into account Food Chain Information (FCI), covering the specific on-farm environmental conditions and individual animal treatments, and the ranking of chemical substances, which should be regularly updated and include new hazards. Sampling, testing and intervention protocols for chemical hazards should be better integrated and should focus particularly on cadmium, phenylbutazone and priority “essential substances” approved for treatment of equine animals. Implementation and enforcement of a more robust and reliable identification system throughout the European Union is needed to improve traceability of domestic solipeds. Meat inspection is recognised as a valuable tool for surveillance and monitoring of animal health and welfare conditions. If visual only <b>post-mortem</b> <b>inspection</b> is implemented for routine slaughter, a reduction in the detection of strangles and mild cases of rhodococcosis would occur.

40|$|Based on {{the idea}} that certain {{circumstances}} regarding the housing of swine could decrease the occurrence of pathological <b>post-mortem</b> meat <b>inspection</b> findings, the present investigation was concentrated on the question whether pigs that were raised in different housing-systems show different results in the <b>post-mortem</b> meat <b>inspection.</b> Over a period of one year (Feb. 2004 – Feb. 2005), the meat inspection findings of all pigs slaughtered at one abattoir in Northwest-Germany were collected and evaluated. The animals originated from three different housing systems with an established management-system and a fourth group with unknown management. A total of 910. 003 pigs were included in the investigation. 202. 953 pathological findings were recorded, which were found in 152. 966 pigs (16. 8 %). The most common finding was “Ascaridosis in the liver” (Milk spots) with 60. 734 cases (6. 67 %). “Pleuritis” and “Pericarditis” followed with 33. 420 (3. 67 %) resp. 29. 088 (3. 2 %) cases. The most common combination of two recordings constitute also of these two findings (Pleuritis, Peritonitis). The most common findings on the carcass were abscesses and joint-alterations in 0. 95 resp. 0. 87 % of all cases. The average occurrence of findings was higher in pigs originating from small (less than 100 slaughtered pigs / year) and very large (over 10. 000 slaughtered pigs / year) farms compared to pigs from farms with a capacity of 101 to 10. 000 slaughtered animals per year. Differences were found between the four compared groups regarding the general occurrence of all findings: the three groups with defined housing factors had medians of 14. 15 (group 1), 7. 81 (group 2) and 10. 5 % (group 3). These medians lie under the median of all animals (14. 58 %) or are close to it. The fourth group with unknown housing factors showed a considerably higher median of 19. 64 %. Therewith the groups with defined housing- and management factors showed a lower occurrence of pathological findings than the group with unknown circumstances on the level of pig farming. Especially group No. 2, the most highly managed, showed the lowest occurrence of findings. There was also a pronounced homogeneity of the animals originating from group 2 and 3, although there were outliers and extreme values in these groups, too. The occurrence of most of the single recordings showed the same distribution over the four groups as it was described for the general occurrence. But there were also some single recordings which showed a considerably higher or lower prevalence in one of the compared groups (e. g. highest prevalence of necrotic neck-tissue in group 2). In these cases a relationship between housing- and management factors and the appearance of <b>post-mortem</b> meat <b>inspection</b> findings is evident. The results of the present investigation allow the conclusion that a higher level of organisation in the management system of pig producing farms can lead to a lower occurrence of pathological findings in the <b>post-mortem</b> meat <b>inspection.</b> However, the appearance of outliers with elevated recorded findings shortens this general statement: the individual influence of the farm manager seems to be of significant importance to the farm’s success...|$|R
40|$|Partially-eviscerated (also {{described}} as effilé, effileé, roped, partly eviscerated, partially drawn, wire drawn or Boston drawn) poultry {{are produced by}} removing the intestines from the poultry carcass but leaving the heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, crop, proventriculus and gizzard inside the body cavity (as defined in Regulation (EC) 543 / 2008). Regulation (EC) 853 / 2004 allows production of partially-eviscerated poultry, provided it is authorised by the competent authority. The overall aim of this project was {{to carry out a}} risk assessment of partially-eviscerated (effilé) poultry production (poultry with the heart, liver, kidneys, crop, proventriculus and gizzard left inside the body cavity) with a view to considering whether the risks of partially-eviscerated poultry production can be managed to an acceptable level such that the practice could be authorised in the UK. To achieve this aim the project had four Objectives: Objective 1, an initial risk assessment of the public health implications of allowing partially-eviscerated birds into the food chain together with a review of all relevant and appropriate literature/company information relating to the control of partially-eviscerated poultry production; Objective 2, an industrial survey of current production of partially-eviscerated poultry; Objective 3, a series of short practical evaluations of any processes where further data was required; Objective 4, a full analysis of all the data and findings of Objectives 1 to 3 and the production of the final project report. The literature review found that documentation on the production of partially-eviscerated poultry was scarce and not comprehensive. However, it highlighted the important points for risk assessment and identified a reason for the development of partial-evisceration processing, i. e. the prevention of “greening” during storage due to the removal of the intestines. The review of current <b>post-mortem</b> <b>inspection</b> of poultry concluded that of the twenty one conditions that are currently looked for during <b>post-mortem</b> <b>inspection</b> of poultry, the majority of these conditions do not pose a risk to public health. Seven conditions were considered to be of concern to public health (Ascites/oedema, Cellulitis, Contamination, Hepatitis, Pericarditis, Perihepatitis/peritonitis, Respiratory disease (airsacculitis)). It was concluded that only four of those seven conditions (hepatitis, pericarditis, perihepatitis/peritonitis, and respiratory disease (air sacculitis)) may not be identified during <b>post-mortem</b> <b>inspection</b> of partially-eviscerated poultry. Their public health significance was considered to be as indicators of the presence of enteric microbial pathogens rather than any inherent pathology of the conditions. Data on condemnations show that the rates of condemnations for these conditions are very low. In addition, these conditions should be clearly identifiable by the end user of the poultry during preparation of the carcass for cooking. Therefore, in our opinion, {{it is unlikely that the}} consumer would ingest such infected viscera. Four French plants and two UK plants were visited during the industrial survey. Although there was a commonality in the practices employed at all of the plants, differences were found between the plants, particularly in the specific method used to remove the intestines from the carcasses in order to produce the product. Four main methods have been identified that can be used to partially eviscerate poultry, three are manual, one is mechanical. The only UK plant currently producing partially-eviscerated poultry, skinned the whole carcass with its feathers on. Partially-eviscerated (effilé) poultry report 3 of 166 Due to the lack of data on the microbiological quality of partially-eviscerated poultry a series of short targeted experimental evaluations were carried out to: (1) investigate the difference in chilling time between partially-eviscerated and eviscerated broiler carcasses; (2) investigate any difference between the growth of microorganisms on partially-eviscerated and eviscerated broiler carcasses during chilled storage; (3) investigate the growth of microorganisms in the organs of partially-eviscerated broiler carcasses during chilled storage. These studies showed: (1) due to the presence of warm internal organs partially-eviscerated poultry carcasses are warmer than eviscerated carcasses at the start of chilling and the rate of cooling of partially-eviscerated poultry carcasses is slower than that of similar eviscerated carcasses; (2) there was no significant difference between the microbiological quality of partially-eviscerated and eviscerated broiler carcasses after chilling and during chilled storage; (3) ACC, Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae, coliform and Escherichia coli counts were all shown to be capable of increasing in/on the heart, crop, feet, gizzard, cavity, skin and liver of partially-eviscerated broiler carcasses after chilling and during chilled storage. A critical review of all available relevant and appropriate literature and data was carried out, supplemented by a survey of current industrial practice and a practical evaluation of processes, to form a risk assessment of the public health implications of allowing partially-eviscerated birds into the food chain. This risk assessment considered: 1. What abnormalities may not be identified in partially-eviscerated poultry production when compared to traditional poultry production; 2. Whether the risk of zoonotic pathogens are any greater for partially-eviscerated poultry production when compared to traditional poultry production; 3. The aetiology of those conditions; 4. The public health implications of those conditions and of allowing partially-eviscerated poultry into the food supply...|$|R

40|$|The National Committee for Food Safety {{was asked}} {{to deliver an opinion}} the {{possible}} risks to consumers that could be posed by a modification of the European legislation on meat inspection following EFSA opinion n. 2351 of 9 October 2011, taking into account the particular livestock raising and meat production in Italy. The working group established within the CNSA thoroughly analysed the Italian situation, also by means of data collection. This led to the identification of two main slaughtering patterns in Italy: high-capacity slaughter plants (approximately 65 - 70 %), mainly slaughtering “heavy pigs” raised in an integrated swine production system, and low/very low slaughter intensity plants, where various types of pigs are handled (30 - 35 % on the whole Italian production). The investigation also highlighted the difficulty in extrapolating and aggregating data concerning the food chain (health hazards linked with the herd of origin, transport and so on) and the outcome of ante-mortem and <b>post-mortem</b> <b>inspection.</b> Finally, considering the data available, the Committee states that {{it is not possible to}} assess the impact that a modification of the European legislation on meat inspection would have on consumers’ protection and suggested that the Ministry of Health launch pilot programs to gather the data necessary to justify and guide Italy’s position in the debate that will be held at European level. In addition, the Directorate General of Animal Health and Veterinary Medicinal Products is invited to asses any potential critical points that any amendment to the current legislation may entail for animal health and welfare...|$|R
40|$|This {{case report}} {{describes}} a small outbreak of neonatal foal death in Belgium due to infection with equine arteritis virus (EAV). The outbreak started with one foal suffering from acute dyspnea {{four days after}} birth. Despite intensive treatment, this foal died within a few hours. Three weeks later, another foal was born on the same farm in a healthy condition, although placental edema was found. At the age of 10 days, the foal showed acute respiratory distress and severe dyspnea and died shortly <b>after.</b> <b>Post-mortem</b> examination of both foals revealed consolidated diaphragmatic lung lobes with compensatory emphysema. Histologic lesions consisted of a mild acute interstitial pneumonia. Microscopic examination of the allantochorion from the second foal showed a focal necrotizing vasculitis, and immunolabeling demonstrated the presence of EAV antigens in chorionic vascular endothelial cells and macrophages. Upon inoculation of rabbit kidney (RK 13) cell culture with a suspension of lung tissue, a cytopathic effect was observed. The agent was identified as equine arteritis virus by means of immunostainings...|$|R
40|$|A cross {{sectional}} study aimed at determining the prevalence {{and type of}} common Fasciola species in cattle was conducted in and around Bahir Dar from November 2008 - March 2009. The study was based on <b>post-mortem</b> <b>inspection</b> of livers of slaughtered animals at Bahir Dar municipality abattoir and coprological examination using sedimentation technique on fecal samples collected from animals of Bahir Dar and surrounding areas. Out of 413 livers inspected, 165 (39. 95 %) were positive for Fasciola species. F. hepatica {{was found to be}} the most prevalent species in cattle of the study area (89. 70 %). About 3. 63 % were positive for F. gigantica and 6. 67 % were harboring mixed infections. Likewise, out of 384 fecal samples examined 141 (36. 72) were positive for the presence of Fasciola eggs. Risk factors such as locality, body condition and sex didn’t show any effect on the prevalence of infections (P> 0. 05). However, breed and age group revealed significant disparity (P< 0. 05) as greater magnitude of infections were detected in exotic breed and young age group, respectively. In view of the current result, fasciolosis could be considered as a major problem in Bahir Dar and surrounding areas as the ecological factors and management conditions are suitable both for the snail intermediate host and the parasite to be maintained. Strategic treatments need to be implemented at appropriate timing with the aim of reducing worm burden from infected animals and preclude pasture contamination. Integrated control approaches involving livestock owners has to be implemented in reducing the population and activity of snail intermediate hosts to enable maximization of long-term returns from such endemic areas...|$|R
