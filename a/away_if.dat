5|$|A {{fusible plug}} is a {{threaded}} metal cylinder usually of bronze, brass or gunmetal, with a tapered hole drilled completely through its length. This hole is sealed {{with a metal}} {{of low melting point}} that flows <b>away</b> <b>if</b> a pre-determined, high temperature is reached. The initial use of the fusible plug was as a safety precaution against low water levels in steam engine boilers, but later applications extended its use to other closed vessels, such as air conditioning systems and tanks for transporting corrosive or liquefied petroleum gasses.|$|E
5|$|Phaeacius {{does not}} try to eat other spiders' eggs, does not enter webs voluntarily, and moves <b>away</b> <b>if</b> it touches one accidentally. It can bite through the threads and pull {{strongly}} with its legs, but cannot escape from very sticky webs. This behaviour {{is quite different from}} that of its close relative, Portia, which hunts actively and can enter any type of web to catch spiders and their eggs.|$|E

5|$|The {{most likely}} {{theory is that}} Leonidas chose to form a rearguard so that the other Greek contingents could get <b>away.</b> <b>If</b> all the troops had retreated, the open ground beyond the pass would have allowed the Persian cavalry to run the Greeks down. If they had all {{remained}} at the pass, {{they would have been}} encircled and would eventually have all been killed. By covering the retreat and continuing to block the pass, Leonidas could save more than 3,000 men, who would be able to fight again.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) {{tries to help}} Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{understand}} how diabetes affects him after Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell) told Tracy that he is at risk of getting diabetes. Kenneth tells him a story of how a wicked witch will come and take him <b>away</b> <b>if</b> he continues to consume his unhealthy eating habits but Tracy does not believe him. Tracy gets disgusted when Kenneth tries to scare him by dressing as a witch but suddenly Jenna comes running in screaming and looking like a witch complete with a broomstick in hand. This scares both Kenneth and Tracy who fearfully vows to change his eating habits immediately.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} used to rapidly distinguish between closely related or morphologically similar species of mushrooms, or, in some cases, as characters to group species into subsections of a genus. Pigments {{present in the}} fungal hyphae are dissolved or react differently with various chemicals, and the color reactions {{may be used as}} taxonomic characters. When a drop of 10% aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide is applied to the cap of B.mirabilis, the tissue turns a fleeting pink color that fades <b>away.</b> <b>If</b> a drop of commercial bleach (calcium hypochlorite) is applied, the tissue loses its color and becomes a pale blue.|$|E

5|$|The male {{chooses the}} nest site, and uses {{it for his}} {{courtship}} display, spending much time calling nearby. When a female comes near a male at his nest the male begins to display by raising his head, drooping his wings, pushing his chest forward, and lowering his tail. He then bows {{up and down in}} front of the female, who will lunge and then fly <b>away</b> <b>if</b> unreceptive. Both sexes take part in building the nest, which consists of a loose, untidy bunch of dry grass which fills the nesting cavity, lined with fur and feathers for warmth.|$|E
5|$|While most jumping spiders {{are active}} hunters, Phaeacius is unusually sedentary, {{generally}} resting in its unusual flattened pose for hours or days on logs, tree barks, {{pieces of wood}} or any other solid surface, where it is very well camouflaged. Its preferred prey is moths and other insects, and jumping spiders. Insects can usually move around an inactive Phaeacius, or even over its body, but if the insect moves between the spider's first pair of legs, Phaeacius lunges extremely quickly to bite the prey. Sometimes Phaeacius takes a more active approach, especially if without prey {{for a week or}} more. Phaeacius does not enter webs voluntary, and moves <b>away</b> <b>if</b> it touches one accidentally. It can bite through the threads and pull strongly with its legs, but cannot escape from very sticky webs.|$|E
5|$|McCudden joined No. 20 Squadron on 8 July 1916. The {{unit was}} {{equipped}} with Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2 and flew from Clairmarais, near Saint-Omer. He flew his first operational sortie two days later and continued as the Battle of the Somme raged. The Squadron was ordered to intercept and shoot down German reconnaissance aircraft. He patrolled the Ypres and Roulers region. He did not spot any enemy reconnaissance machines but did {{come into contact with}} a single Fokker near Lille. Flying in formation, the British were well placed to deal with lone German fighters since they could use their gunners to form a formidable defence screen. This particular German would climb above the British, make a diving attack at the rear-most aircraft and dive <b>away</b> <b>if</b> he did not score a decisive hit. Two days later McCudden ran out of fuel in the Lille district. Disorientated because of heavy mist, he force-landed in Allied territory, crashing and coming to halt in the garden of a French farmhouse. Little damage was done to the machine. On 2 August he took part in an operation to bomb the Zeppelin sheds at Brussels. The flight was unmolested, though the familiar lone Fokker made an appearance and then withdrew without attacking.|$|E

5|$|Unknown {{to either}} Gazan or Mortier, the Coalition had {{concentrated}} {{a force of}} approximately 24,000men (mostly Russians and a few Austrians) within a few kilometers of the French position at Dürenstein. In comparison, Gazan's division had only 6,000men. The Austro-Russian force {{was a mixture of}} infantry, Jägers (frequently deployed as skirmishers), Russian musketeers and Russian and Austrian cavalry, accompanied by more than 68artillery pieces. The Russian cavalry, units of the greatly feared Cossacks, were well-suited for patrolling the river bank; indeed, on 9 November they had taken 40French soldiers as prisoners. Furthermore, reinforcements stood in Moravia, less than two weeks' march <b>away.</b> <b>If</b> {{the main body of the}} French army crossed the river, they would require time to prepare. Kutuzov, who had learned the military arts under the tutelage of the legendary Russian Generalissimo Suvorov, had overall command and would have ample warning of any large-scale French movement.|$|E

25|$|Fruits and {{vegetables}} {{should be kept}} separate from raw foods like meat, poultry, and seafood, {{as well as from}} utensils that have come in contact with raw foods. Fruits {{and vegetables}} that {{are not going to be}} cooked should be thrown <b>away</b> <b>if</b> they have touched raw meat, poultry, seafood, or eggs.|$|E

25|$|Philosophers, such as Wittgenstein, take a {{view that}} is {{considered}} anti-realist and oppose philosophical arguments related to God's existence. For instance, Charles Taylor contends that the real is whatever will not go <b>away.</b> <b>If</b> we cannot reduce talk about God to anything else, or replace it, or prove it false, then perhaps God is as real as anything else.|$|E
25|$|This {{cannot be}} over-emphasized—the Australian {{government}} literally kidnapped these {{children from their}} parents {{as a matter of}} policy. White welfare officers, often supported by police, would descend on Aboriginal camps, round up all the children, separate the ones with light-coloured skin, bundle them into trucks and take them <b>away.</b> <b>If</b> their parents protested they were held at bay by police.|$|E
25|$|A {{feral cat}} is a cat that lives {{outdoors}} {{and has had}} little or no human contact. They do not allow themselves to be handled or touched by humans, and will run <b>away</b> <b>if</b> they are able. They typically remain hidden from humans, although some feral cats become more comfortable with people who regularly feed them. Even with long term attempts at socialization, feral cats usually remain fearful and avoidant of humans.|$|E

25|$|With {{a view to}} {{upgrading}} the venerable 1970s technology with which the VLA was built, the VLA has evolved into the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA). The upgrade has enhanced the instrument's sensitivity, frequency range, and resolution with the installation of new hardware at the San Agustin site. A second phase of this upgrade may add up to eight additional dishes {{in other parts of}} the state of New Mexico, up to 300km <b>away,</b> <b>if</b> funded.|$|E
25|$|Fresh feces {{consist of}} about 80% {{water and the}} {{majority}} of this water will evaporate <b>away</b> <b>if</b> it is allowed to do so by the feces not being enclosed in air-tight containers or vaults. The water content of dried feces after six months of drying is usually less than 25%. Depending on the degree of drying and the intended reuse application an additional post-treatment step, such as composting, might be necessary for reuse of excreta in agriculture.|$|E
25|$|Alligators are {{generally}} timid towards humans {{and tend to}} walk or swim <b>away</b> <b>if</b> one approaches. This has led some people {{to the practice of}} approaching alligators and their nests in a manner that may provoke the animals into attacking. In Florida, feeding wild alligators at any time is illegal. If fed, the alligators will eventually lose their fear of humans and will learn to associate humans with food, thereby becoming both a greater danger to people, and at greater risk from them.|$|E
