[...] Kim Newman, writing in Empire, praised Bekmambetov as [...] "the most exciting action-oriented émigré since John Woo" [...] and commented that the film's gruesome violence [...] "hint at the comic's uncomfortable suggestion that escapism is merely a licence to become monstrous." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Streatham" [...] {{portrait}} is an {{oil painting}} on panel from the 1590s {{believed to be}} a later copy of a portrait of the English noblewoman Lady Jane Grey dating to her lifetime (1536/1537–54). It shows a three-quarter-length depiction of a young woman in Tudor-period dress holding a prayer book, with the faded inscription [...] "Lady Jayne" [...] or [...] "Lady Iayne" [...] in the upper-left corner. It is in poor condition and damaged, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been attacked. Although of historical interest, it is generally considered to be of poor artistic quality. [...] the portrait is in Room 3 of the National Portrait Gallery in London.|$|E

500|$|AllMusic editor Andre Barnes {{views the}} mixtape's music as {{distinct}} from East Coast hip hop, calling it [...] "sonically out of place, recasting the feel of East Coast hip-hop into a quintessential, albeit progressive southern aesthetic with its country funk and cosmic, syrupy backdrops." [...] Jon Caramanica calls Live. Love. ASAP [...] "placeless and universal, an album that sounds <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> ingested the last 20 years of hip-hop’s travels and would be comfortable anywhere." [...] Caramanica notes characteristics of various hip hop scenes other than that of New York's scene, including [...] "chewy, slowed-down homages to Houston" [...] and [...] "nods to New Orleans and Atlanta and the Bay Area and everywhere else hip-hop is made." [...] Alvin Aqua Blanco of HipHopDX writes that the music's grooves [...] "generally stay on the DJ Screw side of the BPMs". Consequence of Sound editor Mike Madden notes its musical dynamic as [...] "Southern flavors crossbreed with plenty of cloudy ambient-rap moments" [...] and views that the cadences of the beats consequently [...] "dictate" [...] ASAP Rocky's rapping style.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "self-organizing" [...] {{was used}} by Immanuel Kant in his 1790 Critique of Judgment, where he argued that {{teleology}} is a meaningful concept only if there exists such an entity whose parts or [...] "organs" [...] are simultaneously ends and means.

2500|$|In The Language Instinct, {{linguist}} Steven Pinker discusses what {{he calls}} [...] "headless words", typically bahuvrihi compounds, such as lowlife and flatfoot, in which life and foot are not heads semantically; that is, a lowlife is not a type of life, and a flatfoot is not a type of foot. When the common form of such a word is singular, it is treated <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a regular plural, even if the final constituent of the word is usually pluralized in a nonregular fashion.

2500|$|Plants are {{extremely}} common in heraldry and figure among the earliest charges. The turnip, for instance, makes an early appearance, as does wheat. Trees also appear in heraldry; {{the most frequent}} tree by far is the oak (drawn with large leaves and acorns), followed by the pine. Apples and bunches of grapes occur very frequently, other fruits less so. When the fruit is mentioned, as to indicate a different tincture, the tree {{is said to be}} fructed of the tincture. If a tree is [...] "eradicated" [...] it is shown <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been ripped up from the ground, the roots being exposed. [...] "Erased" [...] is rarely used for a similar treatment. In Portuguese heraldry, but rarely in other countries, trees are sometimes found decorticated.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{critics have}} made similar charges that, even if Wikipedia {{articles}} are factually accurate, {{they are often}} written in a poor, almost unreadable style. Frequent Wikipedia critic Andrew Orlowski commented: [...] "Even when a Wikipedia entry is 100 per cent factually correct, and those facts have been carefully chosen, it all too often reads <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been translated from one language to another then into a third, passing an illiterate translator at each stage." [...] A study of Wikipedia articles on cancer was conducted in 2010 by Yaacov Lawrence of the Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University. The {{study was limited to}} those articles that could be found in the Physician Data Query and excluded those written at the [...] "start" [...] class or [...] "stub" [...] class level. Lawrence found the articles accurate but not very readable, and thought that [...] "Wikipedia's lack of readability (to non-college readers) may reflect its varied origins and haphazard editing". The Economist argued that better-written articles tend to be more reliable: [...] "inelegant or ranting prose usually reflects muddled thoughts and incomplete information".|$|E
2500|$|In the High Court case of Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs (1989), the applicant's counsel {{argued that}} the Singapore courts should {{recognize}} the basic features doctrine and thereby limit the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution. The doctrine was rejected by Justice Frederick Arthur Chua. He noted that Article 5 of the Constitution does not place any limitations on Parliament's power to amend the Constitution, and concluded that if {{the framers of the}} Constitution had intended for such limitations to apply they would have expressly provided for them. Justice Chua also referred to the Malaysian case Phang Chin Hock, in which the Federal Court had rejected the basic features doctrine, stating that [...] "if our Constitution makers had intended that their successors should not in any way alter their handiwork, it would have been perfectly easy for them to so provide; but nowhere in the Constitution does it appear that that was their intention". Moreover, if proposed constitutional amendments are only valid if they are consistent with its existing provisions this would render Article 159 of the Malaysian Constitution, which provides for amendment of the Constitution, [...] "superfluous, for the Constitution cannot be changed or altered in any way, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been carved in granite".|$|E

2500|$|Early {{research}} showed capsaicin {{to evoke}} a long-onset current {{in comparison to}} other chemical agonists, suggesting the involvement of a significant rate-limiting factor. Subsequent to this, the TRPV1 ion channel {{has been shown to}} be a member of the superfamily of TRP ion channels, and as such is now referred to as [...] There are a number of different TRP ion channels that have been shown to be sensitive to different ranges of temperature and probably are responsible for our range of temperature sensation. Thus, capsaicin does not actually cause a chemical burn, or indeed any direct tissue damage at all, when chili peppers are the source of exposure. [...] The inflammation resulting from exposure to capsaicin is believed to be the result of the body's reaction to nerve excitement. For example, the mode of action of capsaicin in inducing bronchoconstriction is thought to involve stimulation of C fibers [...] culminating in the release of neuropeptides. In essence, the body inflames tissues <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> undergone a burn or abrasion and the resulting inflammation can cause tissue damage in cases of extreme exposure, as is the case for many substances that cause the body to trigger an inflammatory response.|$|E

60|$|SOCIALISM {{has been}} {{advocated}} {{by most of}} its champions chiefly {{as a means of}} increasing the welfare of the wage earning classes, and more particularly their material welfare. It has seemed accordingly, to some men whose aims are not material, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> nothing to offer toward the general advancement of civilization in the way of art and thought. Some of its advocates, moreover--and among these Marx must be included--have written, no doubt not deliberately, as if with the Socialist revolution the millennium would have arrived, {{and there would be no}} need of further progress for the human race. I do not know whether our age is more restless than that which preceded it, or whether it has merely become more impregnated with the idea of evolution, but, for whatever reason, we have grown incapable of believing in a state of static perfection, and we demand, of any social system, which is to have our approval, that it shall contain within itself a stimulus and opportunity for progress toward something still better. The doubts thus raised by Socialist writers make it necessary to inquire whether Socialism would in fact be hostile to art and science, and whether it would be likely to produce a stereotyped society in which progress would become difficult and slow.|$|E
