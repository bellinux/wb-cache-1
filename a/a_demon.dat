5|$|As with {{previous}} Megami Tensei games, demons {{are central to}} combat. They are acquired by the player through real-time negotiation: upon contacting <b>a</b> <b>demon,</b> they must successfully negotiate a conversation with them which can entail either friendly persuasion or intimidation of <b>a</b> <b>demon.</b> Once <b>a</b> <b>demon</b> is allied with the player, they aid them in combat: only one demon can be summoned at any one time, and when summoned that demon follows the player around as they navigate environments. Each time <b>a</b> <b>demon</b> is summoned, it costs {{a certain amount of}} magnetite, an in-game currency. Several demons can be held by them on the go, while further demons can be stored in Shinjuku Babel. Demons and the player gain experience levels separately: when the avatar has gained a level, they can assign stat points to various attributes. These in turn effect their abilities in battle and further skill development. Two different demons can be fused into a new demon in a location known as the Cathedral of Shadows: upon fusion, the new demon can inherit different skills from its demon parents. The skills <b>a</b> <b>demon</b> possesses can be altered or enhanced depending on their use in battles.|$|E
