There was <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> residents over 65, {{compared with the}} national average of 16%, mainly due to seaside towns being popular retirement destinations. For every 100 females, there were 85.7 males.|$|E
5|$|A common {{misconception}} is that {{signs are}} iconically self-explanatory, {{that they are}} a transparent imitation of what they mean, or even that they are pantomime. In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent, either because they were originally arbitrary symbols or because their iconicity has been obscured over time. Even so, in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> signs resemble their referents in some way. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the medium of sign—three-dimensional space—naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.|$|E

In 2011 the proportion of ADF personnel born in Australia and the other predominately Anglo-Celtic countries was higher than this population group's share of both the Australian workforce and overall population. As a result, analyst Mark Thomson {{has argued that the}} ADF is unrepresentative of Australia's society in this regard and that recruiting more personnel from other ethnic backgrounds would improve the ADF's language skills and cultural empathy.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the educational backgrounds and professional expertise of the directors in firms quoted at Borsa Istanbul. The findings of the study reveal that, <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> directors with advanced degrees such as PhDs, serve on various board committees, and <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> them are assigned as independent directors to the boards, compared to directors of lower educational qualifications.

In contrast, a lower <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> professional experts with advanced educational degrees serve as CEOs or chairmen of boards. These results suggest that technical skills and knowledge of directors are valued highly by companies, whereas they are not as highly valued in top managerial positions. 1...|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} few weeks of 2010, there was renewed anxiety about {{excessive}} national debt, with lenders demanding ever-higher interest rates from several countries with higher debt levels, deficits, and current account deficits. This in turn made it difficult for four out of eighteen Eurozone governments to finance further budget deficits and repay or refinance existing government debt, particularly when economic growth rates were low, and when <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> debt was in the hands of foreign creditors, {{as in the case of}} Greece and Portugal.|$|E

According to the company, more than 80% of its passenger car and van tyre sales are winter tyres. Winter tyre sales have a strong seasonal characteristic with 30% of retail sales occurring in the ten days after the first snowfall, thus presenting challenges in production and delivery.|$|E

40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the pattern of dropout among secondary school students in Delta State. To guide this study, 7 research questions were asked and answered, 3 hypotheses stated and tested at 0. 05 level of significance. The design of study was Expost facto using the past school attendance registers as the major instrument. The samples of the study consisted of 120 senior secondary schools and 120 vice principals. The collected data were expressed in percentages, and analyzed with t-test statistic. The major findings of this study included: (i) <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> dropouts in SSI, and a decline in SSII; (ii) <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> dropouts among females in all parameters; (iii) <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> dropouts in rural schools; (iv) <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> dropouts in mixed schools; (v) <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> dropouts in public schools; (vi) a significant difference on percentage dropouts between male and female single sex schools; (vii) a significant difference on <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> dropouts between mixed and single sex schools; and (viii) a significant difference on percentage dropouts between schools in urban and rural areas. It was concluded that the single most important factor, which influenced pattern of dropouts, was student’s sex. </p...|$|R

5|$|The People's Committees led to <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> public {{involvement}} in decision making, {{within the limits}} permitted by the RCC, but exacerbated tribal divisions. They {{also served as a}} surveillance system, aiding the security services in locating individuals with views critical of the RCC, leading to the arrest of Ba'athists, Marxists, and Islamists. Operating in a pyramid structure, the base form of these Committees were local working groups, who sent elected representatives to the district level, and from there to the national level, divided between the General People's Congress and the General People's Committee. Above these remained Gaddafi and the RCC, who remained responsible for all major decisions. In crossing regional and tribal identities, the committee system aided national integration and centralization and tightened Gaddafi's control over the state and administrative apparatus.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} pipeline transport – responsible for <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> {{oil and natural}} gas transportation – is often undermined by the general public {{due to the lack of}} visibility of this mode. Generally held to be safer and more economical and reliable than the other modes of transport, this mode has many advantages over rival modes, such as trucks and railways. Examples of modern pipeline transport include Alashankou-Dushanzi Crude Oil Pipeline and Iran-Armenia Natural Gas Pipeline. International pipeline transport projects, like the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, presently connect modern nation states– in this case, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey– through pipeline networks.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish {{government}} {{believed that}} security would {{come with a}} larger population, {{but was unable to}} attract colonists from Spain or from other New World colonies. By the late 18th century, Texas was one of the least populated regions of New Spain, with fewer than two inhabitants per square league. The population was relatively stagnant, having grown only to 3,169individuals in 1790 from 3,103 in 1777. Over half of the population was classified as Spaniards, with settled Indians making up the next largest category. Blacks, mostly slaves, made up less than 1% of the population in 1777, and only 2.2% of the 1793 census. Over two-thirds of the adults in Texas were married, and single men outnumbered single women, although there was <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> widows. Intermarriage was fairly common, mostly between white men and women of mixed origin. Children from these unions often passed as whites. Illegitimate births increased steadily throughout the century, reaching 20% of all births in 1799. Despite the small population, however, Spain actively discouraged immigration to Texas, and a permanent garrison was placed in Nacogdoches in 1790 to keep foreigners from settling in the area. Immigrants from the United States were allowed to settle in Louisiana and Florida after taking an oath of allegiance, but were not required to convert to Roman Catholicism.|$|E
