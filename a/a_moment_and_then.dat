25|$|Later that summer, a {{well known}} gambler from the Skeena River was aboard, {{and he spoke}} to Captain Bucey about the {{possibility}} of having a poker game on one of the lower decks. The gambler promised it would not only occupy the players, but some spectators as well. Bucey was agreeable to the idea and gave his consent. Although gambling on sternwheelers that held liquor licenses was illegal, it was also a long and much-loved tradition. The game started off modestly enough, but soon huge sums were being wagered, and some large jackpots were being won. Present {{since the start of the}} game was a stranger, who was a provincial policeman who was being transferred to a new post by the constable at Fort George. Several hours into play, and when the table was covered with a drift of bills, this man abruptly announced his identity, declared the game illegal and confiscated all the money. The players and other spectators were outraged and immediately turned into an angry mob. The Skeena River gambler jumped to the policeman's defense and let the man return to his stateroom while he tried to mollify the angry men. After promising to refund any losses, the gambler went to speak to Captain Bucey to see what could be done about the matter. Bucey thought for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> suggested to the gambler that he go talk to the policeman and suggest that if he let the game continue, he can keep half the money he took. The gambler did so, and was surprised when the policeman accepted the bribe. Upon hearing of the policeman's decision, Bucey had his first mate take over at the wheel, and accompanied by two deckhands, he went to the policeman's stateroom and took him down to the lower deck where the game had started again. Once there he told everyone how the policeman had tried to steal their money, but he assured everyone that he had complete control of his own ship, and that this incident would be reported to the magistrate at Fort George, and that the crooked policeman would be on the next steamer south. The bribe was surrendered, and the game continued unhampered. Captain Bucey had won the respect of his passengers, and their friendship.|$|E
500|$|On his {{approach}} to casting, Stallone {{said that he was}} looking for actors who had not experienced recent success in film: [...] "I like using people that had <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> maybe have fallen on some hard times and give them another shot. So we’re always looking for actors like Michael Biehn and Michael Paré. I like those kinds of guys. Someone did it for me and I like to see if I can do it for them." ...|$|E

500|$|As the Marines {{formed into}} a horseshoe-shaped line around Hill 123, Tamura's {{battalion}} {{began a series}} of frontal assaults on the hill, charging up the saddle from Hill 80 and up from below {{the east side of the}} ridge. Under the light of parachute flares dropped by at least one Japanese floatplane, the Marines repulsed the first two attacks by Tamura's men. Tamura's troops hoisted a [...] "regimental" [...] gun to the top of Hill 80 in an effort to fire it directly at the Marines. This gun, which [...] "could have turned the tide in favor of the Japanese," [...] however, was disabled by a faulty firing pin. At midnight, during a short lull in the fighting, Edson ordered Parachute Companies B and C to advance from behind Hill 123 to strengthen his left flank. With fixed bayonets, the Paramarines swept forward, killing Japanese soldiers who had overrun the Marine lines and were apparently preparing to roll up the Marine lines from the flank, and took position on the east side of the hill. Marines from other units, as well as members of Edson's command staff, including Major Bailey, took ammunition and grenades under fire to the Marines around Hill 123, who were running critically low. Said Marine participant Captain William J. McKennan, [...] "The Japanese attack was almost constant, like a rain that subsides for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> pours the harder... When one wave was mowed down – and I mean mowed down – another followed it into death." ...|$|E
2500|$|Producer {{and singer}} Joe Henry, in a 2011 interview, cited [...] "Ode" [...] as [...] "an {{incredibly}} deft bit of {{writing in the}} way that that story is unfolded. … [...] places the character in <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> the story just starts to unfold around it", and was a song that influenced him early in his life listening to music on the radio.|$|E
2500|$|... "Look Before You Leap" [...] (season two, episode 21)– Laverne is {{sick and}} thinks {{that she might}} be {{pregnant}} because of an incident the previous month where she comes home wearing men's undershorts. Lenny asks her to marry him, but she gently declines. When Frank comes to the apartment, Laverne tells him about the situation. He comforts her for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> Shirley takes her to the hospital to see if she is pregnant. In the end, Laverne and Shirley head to the Pizza Bowl and whisper in everyone's ear. After that, everyone starts singing [...] "Hallelujah", implying that Laverne's not pregnant after all.|$|E

2500|$|Sometime later, Harvey meets a {{young woman}} outside a diner and offers her a ride, but she rejects him and leaves. A large icicle falls from an {{overhead}} branch, hitting Harvey on the shoulder. He loses his balance {{on the ice and}} falls backward over a cliff to his death. Time passes, and Susie sees that her family is healing, which Susie refers to as [...] "the lovely bones" [...] that grew around her absence. As the film concludes, Susie finally enters Heaven, telling the audience: [...] "My name is Salmon, like the fish; first name Susie. I was 14 years old when I was murdered on December 6, 1973. I was here for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> I was gone. I wish you all a long and happy life." ...|$|E
2500|$|After 1723, the {{situation}} seemed to stabilise, {{much to the}} delight of the Dutch. Javanese nobility had learned that the alliance of VOC’s military with any Javanese faction made them nearly invincible. It seemed that VOC’s plan to reap the profit from a stable Java under a kingdom which was deeply indebted to VOC would soon be realised. In 1726, Amangkurat IV fell to an illness that resembled poisoning. His son assumed the throne as Pakubuwana II, this time without any serious resistance from anybody. The history for the period of 1723 until 1741 was dominated by a series of intrigues which further showed the fragile nature of Javanese politics, held together by Dutch’s effort. In this relatively peaceful situation, the king could not gather the support of his [...] "subjects" [...] and instead was swayed by short-term ends siding with this faction for <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> to another. The king never seemed to lack challenges to his [...] "legitimacy".|$|E
2500|$|At this time, the Jinwu {{guards were}} in Hanyuan Hall, {{along with the}} Jingzhao Municipal {{government}} police under Luo Liyan and office of imperial censors' guards under Li Xiaoben, attacking the eunuchs. [...] More than 10 eunuchs were killed or injured, but this attack was unable to prevent the eunuchs from carrying Emperor Wenzong's litter through Xuanzheng Gate (...) , into the palace. [...] Li Xun, who was still {{holding on to the}} litter, urged Emperor Wenzong to stop, but Emperor Wenzong yelled at him to stop yelling. [...] The eunuch Chi Zhirong (...) battered Li Xun's chest, and Li Xun fell onto the ground. [...] The litter then entered Xuanzheng Gate, and the gate was closed. [...] The eunuchs were cheering. [...] The officers lined up at Hanyuan Hall paused for <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> fled. [...] Li Xun, knowing that he had failed, put on a green uniform belonging to his staff members, got onto a horse, and fled, stating loudly on the road, [...] "What crime did I commit that I am exiled?" [...] No one on the road suspected him of being Li Xun. [...] Meanwhile, Shu Yuanyu, along with other chancellors Wang Ya and Jia Su returned {{to the office of the}} chancellors, and believed that soon Emperor Wenzong would summon them to deal with the aftermath. [...] When the officials under them came to inquire what had occurred, they told those subordinates to keep working and not to worry.|$|E
