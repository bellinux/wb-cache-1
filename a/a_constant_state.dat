Over 82 million tonnes (90 million tons) of {{limestone}} rock slid down Turtle Mountain within 100 seconds, obliterating {{the eastern edge of}} Frank, the Canadian Pacific Railway line and the coal mine. It was one of the largest landslides in Canadian history and remains the deadliest, as between 70 and 90 of the town's residents were killed, most of whom remain buried in the rubble.

5|$|The {{threat of}} Apache raids led to <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> of unease in San Antonio, and some {{families}} left the area, while others {{refused to leave}} {{the safety of the}} town to tend their livestock. The problems culminated with a late-night raid on San Antonio by 350Apache on June 30, 1745, retaliation for a Spanish military campaign several months before. The attackers were repelled with the assistance of 100Indians from Mission Valero. The Apache also preyed on other tribes, including the Deadose and Tonkawa. In the 1740s, these weaker tribes requested missions along the San Gabriel River in the hopes that the Spanish could protect them from attack. Mission San Francisco Xavier was established at the confluence of the San Gabriel River and Bushy Creek in January 1746 to serve the Deadose, Mayeye, and Coco Indians. In 1748 alone, the Apaches raided the mission four times, killing threesoldiers and four of the Indian residents. Many of the resident Indians fled the mission due to the threat of attacks. This did not deter the missionaries, who founded two more missions, San Ildefonso and Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria, in the area the following year. Within six months, all of the potential converts at San Ildefonso had left. By 1755, the missions were transferred to a new location on the San Marcos River.|$|E

40|$|International audienceExplicit {{constrained}} {{control is}} relatively simple when a controlled contractive set is available. However, {{the complexity of}} the explicit controller will depend on {{the complexity of the}} controlled contractive set. The ability to design a low complexity controlled contractive set is therefore desirable. Most methods for finding controlled contractive sets either assume the use of <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> linear <b>state</b> feedback, or is based on reachable set computations. In the first case, the assumption of <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> linear <b>state</b> feedback is restrictive (as MPC controllers for linear systems are typically piecewise affine), and in the second case the complexity of the controlled contractive set may be very high. Initial results on the construction of low complexity controlled contractive sets without assuming linear state feedback were reported at the IFAC World Congress in 2014. The present paper addresses shortcomings in the previous results, including the ability to handle identical modes in series (corresponding to a non-diagonalizable A matrix) and oscillatory modes. The paper suggests a method to find a flexible complexity controlled contractive set...|$|R
