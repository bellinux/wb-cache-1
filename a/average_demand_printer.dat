Document imaging systems can take many forms including microfilm, on <b>demand</b> <b>printers,</b> facsimile machines, copiers, multifunction printers, document scanners, computer output microfilm (COM) and archive writers. Document Imaging means the conversion of paper files (of any size or description) or microfilm / fiche to digital images.|$|R

3000|$|... {{the peak}} demand is the demand rate that is {{typically}} used to size the system components {{and so will}} affect {{the design of the}} system. The demand scenarios [W 13] are more likely to affect the operation of the system as the demand varies over the simulation time. The peak day <b>demand</b> (<b>average</b> <b>demand</b> over the peak day), the peak hour <b>demand</b> (the <b>average</b> <b>demand</b> over the hour with maximum consumption in the peak day) and <b>average</b> <b>demand</b> rates may also be required. Fire loading demands and other emergency conditions will affect the design of the system, for example storage tanks should be sized to be able to provide demand in the case of fires, other emergencies and system failures (e.g. if the supply to the tank is cut off).|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{studies the}} {{optimization}} of container shipping network structures and its operations under changing cargo demand and freight rates. Most existing studies that use a given matrix of <b>average</b> <b>demand</b> {{have not been}} able to deal with practical issues such as empty container repositioning, ship-slot allocating, ship sizing, and container configuration. In this paper, these issues are simultaneously considered based on a series of matrices of demand in a year. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer non-linear programming problem (MINP) with an objective of maximizing the average unit ship-slot profit in three stages by using analytical methodology. A genetic algorithm based on heuristic is utilized to arrive at solutions. Through empirical experiments and comparisons, results show that the proposed model can provide a more realistic solution to the issues on the basis of changing demand and freight rates; the model provides a more effective approach to the optimization of container shipping network structures and operations than does a model based on <b>average</b> <b>demand...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} {{a model for}} {{forecasting}} water demands over a 24 -hour time window using solely a pair of coefficients whose value is updated at every forecasting step is presented. The first coefficient expresses the ratio between the <b>average</b> water <b>demand</b> over the 24 hours that follow the time the forecast is made and the <b>average</b> water <b>demand</b> over the 24 hours that precede it. The second coefficient expresses {{the relationship between the}} <b>average</b> water <b>demand</b> in a generic hour falling within the 24 -hour forecasting period and the <b>average</b> water <b>demand</b> over that period. These coefficients are estimated using the information available in the weeks prior to the time of forecasting and therefore the model does not require any actual calibration process. The length of the time series necessary to implement the model is thus just a few weeks (3 - 4 weeks) and the model can be parameterized and used without there being any need to collect hourly water demand data for long periods...|$|R
50|$|Seasonality is a {{characteristic}} of a time series in which the data experiences regular and predictable changes which recur every calendar year. Any predictable change or pattern in a time series that recurs or repeats over a one-year period {{can be said to}} be seasonal. It is common in many situations - such as grocery store or even in a Medical Examiner’s office—that the demand depends {{on the day of the}} week. In such situations, the forecasting procedure calculates the seasonal index of the “season” - seven seasons, one for each day - which is the ratio of the <b>average</b> <b>demand</b> of that season (which is calculated by Moving Average or Exponential Smoothing using historical data corresponding only to that season) to the <b>average</b> <b>demand</b> across all seasons. An index higher than 1 indicates that demand is higher than average; an index less than 1 indicates that the demand is less than the average.|$|R

Description The Market Surveillance Panel first observed, in its Oct 2002 Report, that the predispatch prices have been consistently higher than the real time prices. The MSP identified several factors contributing to this difference including the demand forecast error. One of in {{the components of the}} forecast error is the use of the forecast peak demand as opposed to using the forecast <b>average</b> <b>demand</b> value expected within the hour. This component introduces a natural bias in the forecasting of the HOEP. The MSP did not recommend that the IMO discontinue the use of the peak demand in favour of the <b>average</b> <b>demand</b> because of the potential impact on system reliability. Instead, the MSP recommended many other approaches that could reduce the price forecast error. 1 The MSP has identified the use of peak demand as a problem for two reasons. First, the use of peak demand results in a persistent positive difference betwee...|$|R
40|$|Heterogenous {{wireless}} networks (Hetnets) {{provide a}} powerful approach {{to meet the}} massive growth in traffic demands, but also impose a significant challenge on backhaul. Caching at small base stations (BSs) and wireless small cell backhaul have been proposed as attractive solutions to address this new challenge. In this paper, we consider the optimal caching and user association to minimize the total time to satisfy the <b>average</b> <b>demands</b> in cached-enabled Hetnets with wireless backhaul. We formulate this problem as a mixed discrete-continuous optimization for given bandwidth and cache resources. First, we characterize {{the structure of the}} optimal solution. Specifically, we show that the optimal caching is to store the most popular files at each pico BS, and the optimal user association has a threshold form. We also obtain the closed-form optimal solution in the homogenous scenario of pico cells. Then, we analyze the impact of bandwidth and cache resources on the minimum total time to satisfy the <b>average</b> <b>demands.</b> Finally, using numerical simulations, we verify the analytical results.
