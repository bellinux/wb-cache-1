40|$|ABSTRACT. The <b>antinuclear</b> <b>antibodies</b> are {{markers of}} {{autoimmune}} diseases, {{but they also}} appear in healthy individuals and in non-autoimmune diseases. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the frequency of IgG <b>antinuclear</b> <b>antibodies</b> in patients with chronic infections, comparing different methods: 1. indirect immunofluorescent assay on rat liver tissue sections, HEp- 2 cell line and on the serum-free McCoy-Plovdiv cell line; 2. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Sera from 93 patients with chronic pneumonia and chronic viral hepatitis were screened for <b>antinuclear</b> <b>antibodies</b> through indirect immunofluorescent assay at 1 / 40 serum dilution on McCoy-Plovdiv and HEp- 2 substrates. The positive ones were evaluated for <b>antinuclear</b> <b>antibodies</b> at higher titer to negative result. Forty eight of them were also evaluated through indirect immunofluorescent assay on rat liver and through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. At a titer 1 / 40 13 % of the sera were positive for <b>antinuclear</b> <b>antibodies</b> on McCoy-Plovdiv, 6 %- on HEp- 2, 2 %- on rat liver.

After observing a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who had a positive toxoplasma IFA test but a negative dye test, we studied sera with high titers of <b>antinuclear</b> <b>antibodies</b> from 16 SLE patients and from 2 with rheumatoid arthritis for Toxoplasma antibodies in the immunoglobulin G and M (IgG and IgM) IFA tests and the dye test. Results of these tests were compared with titers of <b>antinuclear</b> <b>antibodies,</b> precipitating antibodies to single-strand deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and binding antibodies by use of DNA labeled with 3 H-actinomycin D. Of 18 patients, 11 had IgG and 4 had IgM IFA Toxoplasma antibodies; only 2 had antibodies detectable in the dye test. The immunofluorescence patterns in the Toxoplasma IFA test were indistinguishable from those obtained in patients with toxoplasmosis without <b>antinuclear</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Absorption of SLE sera with DNA did not result in a decrease in Toxoplasma IFA titers. When SLE sera were absorbed with live T. gondii, a marked drop in IgG IFA titer was observed as well as a decrease in titers of <b>antinuclear</b> <b>antibodies</b> and 3 H-DNA binding. Treatment of Toxoplasma cells with deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease did not decrease their fluorescence.

50|$|In about 50% {{of cases}} of burning mouth {{sensation}} no identifiable cause is apparent, these cases are termed (primary) BMS. Several theories of what causes BMS have been proposed, and these are supported by varying degrees of evidence, but none is proven.

Another theory is that BMS is related to autoimmunity, as abnormal <b>antinuclear</b> <b>antibody</b> and rheumatoid factor {{can be found in}} the serum of more than 50% of persons with BMS, but these levels may also be seen in elderly people who do not have any of the symptoms of this condition.

40|$|Background: Autoimmune {{involvement}} in the pathogenesis of asthma and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) has been proposed, and autoantibodies are a hallmark of autoimmunity. This study aimed to compare the autoantibody profiles of asthma and COPD, and the relationship between autoantibodies and features of these diseases. Methods: We recruited 110 asthma patients and 92 COPD patients for a prospective study. Six autoantibody types were evaluated: <b>antinuclear</b> <b>antibody,</b> anti-cytoplasmic antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, myeloperoxidase–anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (MPO-ANCA) and proteinase 3 -ANCA. Other clinical data were also recorded concurrently. Results: An <b>antinuclear</b> <b>antibody</b> titre of ≥ 1 : 160 presented only in asthma but not in COPD (10 % vs. 0 %, p =  0. 0002). Eosinophil counts in blood were negative predictors of <b>antinuclear</b> <b>antibody</b> in asthma. Conversely, eosinophil counts in blood and immunoglobulin-E levels of ≥ 100  IU/mL were positively associated with rheumatoid factor in asthma but not in COPD. There was no relationship between <b>antinuclear</b> <b>antibody</b> or rheumatoid factor and disease severity. Conclusions: It is possible that asthma tends to involve autoimmunity associated with <b>antinuclear</b> <b>antibody</b> more frequently than COPD because asthma is the more robust factor for <b>antinuclear</b> <b>antibody</b> positivity. <b>Antinuclear</b> <b>antibody</b> and rheumatoid factor are associated with eosinophilic responses, but they do not work as biomarkers for disease severity...|$|E

40|$|The {{natural history}} of the F 1 hybrid of NZB and NZW mice (NZB/W) is charscterized by the {{spontaneous}} appearance of serum <b>antinuclear</b> <b>antibodies</b> followed {{by the development of}} a fatal snbacute glomerulonephritis very s~mflar to the human lupus nephritis [see review by Howie and Helyer (1) ].
