25|$|During the 1860s north Queensland's early pastoralists {{struggled}} to survive {{for a number}} of reasons. Within a decade they found that footrot, fluke, lung worm and spear grass made most of the area unsuitable for sheep. There was no ready market for cattle because population centres were too far away. Until boiling down works opened in Townsville and Burketown in 1866 almost the only means of disposing of surplus cattle locally was to sell them to other squatters stocking new runs. Ports were distant <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> them difficult, the Aboriginal people were hostile, the climate was challenging and from 1866 Queensland was in financial crisis.|$|E

The San Francisco Chronicle praised Hawke and Delpy's performances: [...] " [...] interact so gently and simply that you feel certain that they helped write the dialogue.

But as we were in the writers' room, when things started shifting which led to all this new stuff that wasn't in the comic book series, I thought that was great because it wasn't me writing the same-old same-old or rewriting something I had already done and trying to make it interesting for myself. It was really an entirely new story: getting the gang members in there <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> write Daryl [...] which is one of my favorite characters on the show, despite the fact that he’s not in the comic book.

500|$|At {{the heart}} of the Octavia Hill system was the weekly visit to collect rent. From the outset, Hill {{conceived}} this as a job for women only. She and her assistants (who included Emma Cons and Eva McLaren) combined the weekly rent collection with checking every detail of the premises <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> know the tenants personally, acting as early social workers. At first Hill believed, [...] "Voluntary workers are a necessity. They are better than paid workers, and can be had in sufficient numbers." [...] Later, she found it expedient to maintain a paid workforce. Her system required a large staff. Rent was collected on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday mornings. Rent accounts were balanced in the afternoons and arrangements were made with contractors for repairs. On Thursdays and Fridays arrears were pursued, contractors' invoices paid, new tenancy lettings and tenants' moves organised.|$|E

500|$|Although {{each of the}} film's key puppets {{required}} a small team of puppeteers to operate it, the most complex puppet of the production was Hoggle. Shari Weiser was inside the costume, while Hoggle's face was radio-controlled by Brian Henson and three other operators. Speaking in the Inside the Labyrinth documentary, Brian Henson explained that Weiser [...] "does all the body movement and her head is inside the head. However, the jaw is not connected to her jaw. Nothing that the face is doing has any connection with what she's doing with her face. The other {{four members of the}} crew are all radio crew, myself included." [...] Speaking of the challenges involved with performing Hoggle, Brian Henson said, [...] "five performers trying to get one character out of one puppet was a very tough thing. Basically what it takes is a lot of rehearsing <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> know each other." ...|$|E

On the frontlines, [...] east of Nevel, Soviet forces were threatening to break through around the Rzhev salient and encircle the German 9th Army, and on 21 November the 12th Panzer Division received orders to march for the front.

500|$|... "Getting Ready for Christmas Day" [...] {{was one of}} the album’s {{earliest}} completed songs, and {{it contains}} a sample from a 1941 sermon by the Reverend J.M. Gates. The sermon inspired the song’s creation, with a certain rhythmic tone to his oration that interested him. Simon heard the sermon on a box set titled Goodbye Babylon, which consists early 20th century Americana. It came together quicker than other songs, with Simon recording his guitar live. The track also references his nephew, who served multiple tours in the Iraq War. [...] "The Afterlife" [...] concerns a man dying <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> heaven, where he waits in line to meet with God, where everyone is [...] "filling out forms and waiting in line to catch 'a glimpse of the divine.'" [...] While in line, he unsuccessfully hits on a woman. When he finally meets God, he is taken aback, and can only spout gibberish. The point of the song is that having questions for God would cease to be relevant if one were to confront God face-to-face due the enormity of such a theoretical situation.|$|E

[...] The animators would often observe and document the voice actors while they recorded their dialogue, using their movements and mannerisms as a visual aid.

500|$|... 20th Century Fox saw X-Men: First Class as {{the first}} film of a new X-Men trilogy. Donner {{compared}} the franchise plans to the darker, more mature content of the Harry Potter film series. Early reports said Matthew Vaughn and Singer were returning to direct and produce the sequel, respectively. While still attached to the project as a director, Vaughn said, [...] "First Class is similar to Batman Begins, {{where you have the}} fun of introducing the characters <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> know them, but that takes time. But with the second one, you can just get on with it and have a rollicking good time. That's the main difference between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight". Describing the possible beginning of the film, Vaughn said, [...] "I {{thought it would be fun}} to open with the Kennedy assassination, and we reveal that the magic bullet was controlled by Magneto". Singer said the film could be set around the civil rights movement or the Vietnam War, and that Wolverine could once again be featured. Singer also talked about [...] "changing history" [...] in an interview with Empire magazine. He said he does not want people to panic about events in the past [...] "erasing" [...] the storylines of the previous X-Men films, as he believes in multiverses, explaining the possibility of certain events can exist equally in the histories of alternate universes.|$|E
500|$|Shonda Rhimes, series' creator, {{says that}} the {{character}} was envisioned [...] "an old-fashioned tortured hero" [...] and likens him to Heathcliff. Originally set to appear in a multi-episode story arc, Kevin McKidd's contract was extended, securing him a slot as a series' regular of Grey's Anatomy. In July 2008, Entertainment Weekly announced the possibility of McKidd becoming a series' regular, with this possibility eventually being confirmed by People. When asked of how he got involved with the show, McKidd offered the insight: [...] McKidd told BuddyTV, [...] "It's been really great. I was nervous when I started because every job I've ever done before this, I {{have been in the}} job right from day one when everybody's new <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> know each other. So I was nervous because I had never done this before. And I feel really grateful to the Grey's cast and crew and everyone there, really, because they've been so nice to me and gracious and accepting of me joining the show. The transition was much easier than I thought it might be, which I'm very grateful for." [...] McKidd has told People that he thinks Grey's Anatomy is a great show and he feels lucky to be on it. Shonda Rhimes, the series' creator, said of his addition, [...] "I am excited to have Kevin McKidd joining us for the season, he's been a delight to collaborate with and brings incredible passion, talent and creativity to his work. Plus, he’s already got the ‘Mc’ built into his name so we had to keep him." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 25, 2005, Giants patriarch Wellington Mara {{died after}} a brief illness, {{at the age of}} 89. Mara had been {{involved}} with the Giants since he was nine years old, when he was a ball boy for the team. Mara was universally beloved by the players. Hall of Fame linebacker Harry Carson, who played during some of the team's down years in the 1970s, never became angry at Mara despite being frustrated with the team's performances. [...] "The Giants’ organization cares about its players more than most teams in the NFL. This stems from the top. The Maras are family men and Wellington, especially, has sought to cultivate a family atmosphere in the team.... If any NFL owner deserves a championship, it is Mara." [...] According to Parcells, Wellington made an effort {{to get to know each}} of his players. [...] "The Giants are Wellington Mara’s whole life, they have been his whole life. He’s at the office every day, he’s at practice very day, he loves hanging around the locker room <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>to</b> know the players." [...] Despite his strong religious convictions, he put aside his personal beliefs, and avoided preaching to players who were having problems. [...] "Nobody did more for me than Wellington Mara." [...] Lawrence Taylor said. [...] "He didn’t have to save me, he didn’t have to keep helping me to find help.... And he never lectured me. I could tell he disapproved but he never lectured me." [...] Several players went to Mara's bedside as he was dying to say goodbye to the owner. The team dedicated their next game to Mara, and shut out the Redskins 36–0.|$|E
