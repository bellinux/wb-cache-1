40|$|The {{complications}} of temporary transvenous endocardial pacing as {{performed in the}} University Hospital Kuala Lumpur, from 1971 to 1979 were reviewed. 125 temporary pacings were performed in 111 patients. Different routes of temporary pacing were used: namely percutaneous subclavian vein and femoral vein puncture and acutecubital vein cutdown. The latter route {{was associated with a}} higher incidence of dislodgement and infection. Other common complications encountered were ventricular <b>arrhythymia</b> and generator failure...|$|E
40|$|Nuclear Medicine Department, King Saud University and King Khalid University Hospital, RiyadhThallium-Ztll {{myocardial}} perfusion imaging (11 - 201 MPI) {{performed in}} patients after maximum exercise {{is widely used}} to evaluate patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). Intravenous dipyridamole (DP), {{by virtue of its}} potent coronary vasodilation effect, can produce results similar to those of maximum exercise. To evaluate the safety and diagnostic usefulness of intravenous DP thallium imaging, 100 patients with suspected or known CAD were studied. Thirty-two patients were referred for diagnostic cardiac catheterization and these patients also underwent exercise TI- 201 MPI. The sensitivity and specificity ofTI 201 MPI studies were 92 " 1 : and 83 %, respectively, for DP; and 88 % and 83 %, respectively, for exercise 11 - 201 studies. Of the 100 patients studied, 44 had some adverse effects. Noncardiac side effects were transient and required no treatmentcardiac side effect, occurring in 24 patients, and ischemic electrocardiograpic changes were seen in 14 patients. Intravenous aminophylline (125 mg) was used in 13 patients to reverse these effects. No patient suffered myocardial infarction or severe <b>arrhythymia,</b> and none died. We concluded that TI- 201 MPI after coronary vasodilation with intravenous dipyridamole is a safe and better noninvasive procedure for the evaluation of CAD in patients who are unable or not expected to achieve an adequate exercise level...|$|E
40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is a {{major cause}} of stroke. AF incidence is increased in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW), represents about 10 % of spontaneous arrhythmias and has several mechanisms as the degeneration of atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) into AF, the AF facilitation by the atrial insertion of accessory pathway (AP) or another origin. The purpose of study was to assess the incidence of stroke in patients (pts) who had a preexcitation syndrome. Population 707 pts aged from 5 to 85 years (mean 34. 5 ± 17) were studied for a WPW: 93 pts had unexplained syncope; 247 pts were asymptomatic; 367 pts had spontaneous tachycardias; among these pts 52 had documented AF. Electrophysiological study (EPS) consisted of atrial pacing and programmed atrial stimulation in control state and if necessary after infusion of isoproterenol. Clinical and electrophysiological data were collected. ResultsStroke was noted in 5 pts (0. 7 %), 2 women, 3 men aged from 53 to 75 years. They had a normal carotid and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. One pt had ischemic heart disease and the remaining pts had no heart disease. Their age was significantly older than remaining population (62 ± 9 years vs 34 ± 17) (p< 0. 0002). Only one pt had spontaneous AF; 51 other pts with spontaneous AF had no stroke. One of 247 was asymptomatic; one pt of 93 had syncope and 2 pts of 315 had spontaneous AVRT. At EPS, one asymptomatic pt had AP with long refractory period and no inducible tachycardia. Two pts with spontaneous tachycardias had only inducible AVRT and the pt with spontaneous AF had inducible antidromic tachycardia and AF. The pt with syncope had only inducible AF. These electrophysiological data did not differ from the remaining population. Anticoagulants were maintained after AP ablation, although the disappearance of <b>arrhythymias.</b> ConclusionsThe risk of stroke in WPW syndrome is very low (0. 7 %). Only one clinical factor differs significantly from remaining population, the relatively old age (mean 62 ± 9 years). All other clinical factors as sex, associated heart disease, spontaneous symptoms and all electrophysiological data did not differ from remaining population...|$|R
