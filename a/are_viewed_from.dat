5|$|As {{a visual}} novel, School Days {{contains}} extremely minimal gameplay. The game's core onscreen presentation {{is composed of}} scenes that <b>are</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> a mostly third-person perspective. At predetermined intervals, the game pauses, and players are presented with one to two responses or actions relevant to the scene in progress to make, or not make, on behalf of characters. Each selection branches the game's progress {{up to that point}} in an alternate direction, while also causing the player's love toward a character to blossom, plateau, or diminish, thus providing for a nonlinear storytelling experience. Being an erotic title, relationships between characters may become sexual; scenes of this kind depict a varying combination of French kissing, masturbation, oral sex and intercourse. Genitalia are pixelated in the original Japanese releases, but the Western release of School Days HQ is uncensored. Sex scenes are omitted from the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable ports of the game.|$|E
5|$|As a {{survival}} horror title, Resident Evil 2 features {{the same basic}} gameplay mechanics as its predecessor, Resident Evil. The player explores a fictional city while solving puzzles and fighting monsters. The game's two protagonists may be equipped with firearms, but limited ammunition adds a tactical element to weapon use. On the status screen, the player can check {{the condition of the}} protagonists, use medicine to heal their wounds, and assign weapons. The characters' current health can also be determined by their posture and movement speed. For example, a character will hold their stomach in pain if wounded, and will limp slowly if on the verge of death. The protagonists may carry a limited number of items, and must store others in boxes placed throughout the game world, where they may later be retrieved. Each protagonist is joined by a support partner {{during the course of the}} story. These characters accompany the player in certain scenes, and occasionally become playable. Certain rooms contain typewriters that the player may use to save the game. However, each save expends one of a limited number of ink ribbons, which the player must collect in the game world. The graphics of Resident Evil 2 are composed of real-time generated– and thus movable– polygonal character and item models, superimposed over pre-rendered backgrounds that <b>are</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> fixed camera angles.|$|E

25|$|In June 2012, Google {{announced}} that it has captured 20 petabytes of data for Street View, comprising photos taken along 5 million miles of roads, covering 39 countries and about 3,000 cities. Coverage includes much of North and South America, from Cambridge Bay, Nunavut to Half Moon Island in the South Shetland Islands. Maps also include panoramic views taken under water such as in West Nusa Tenggara underwater coral, in the Grand Canyon, inside museums, and Liwa Desert in United Arab Emirates which <b>are</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> camelback. In a ten-day trek with Apa Sherpa, Google documented Khumbu, Nepal with its Mount Everest, Sherpa communities, monasteries and schools.|$|E
25|$|The {{gesture of}} {{doubling}} – as an aesthetic and conceptual strategy – {{has been a}} recurrent motif for Horn since 1980, a tool that invites careful scrutiny from the viewer. In 2008, Bird (1998–2007), the artist’s long-running photographic series of taxidermied Icelandic wildfowl were shown for the first time. Photographed at close range against white backgrounds (as though obeying the conventional format of studio portraiture) the birds <b>are</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> behind, their unique physiognomies and markings resulting in inscrutable shapes and patterns on the photographs’ surfaces. Despite the singular form of the title the birds in this series are all presented in pairs, images that are hung side by side one another highlighting the differences and similarities between the two.|$|E
500|$|Space travel {{forms an}} {{important}} aspect of gameplay. When traveling within a single solar system, the ship and its surroundings <b>are</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> a third-person perspective on an [...] "In System Travel Screen." [...] Navigation takes place in real-time as the player maneuvers the ship between explorable worlds, visits a gas giant to refuel, or engages in combat with other spaceships. Some solar systems contain more than one explorable planet, but most such planets in the game may be reached only after the player's spaceship has been outfitted with a [...] "jump drive" [...] capable of interstellar travel and accompanying computer software to control it.|$|E

500|$|Mother 3 {{retains the}} turn-based battle system {{featured}} in EarthBound. When the player comes {{into contact with}} an enemy in the overworld, the game transitions to a battle screen. Battles <b>are</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> a first-person perspective, showing the enemies against a distorted, animated background. The player can assign each character in their party to perform an action, such as attacking an enemy or using items to restore HP or PP. Some characters can utilize psychic-based abilities referred to as PSI, which includes stronger attacks and healing abilities, and require PP to execute. Like EarthBound, combat uses a [...] "rolling health" [...] system: {{when one of the}} player's characters is injured, its HP will gradually [...] "roll" [...] down, similar to an odometer, rather than immediately decremented. This allows a mortally wounded character to perform actions like attacking or healing themselves, as long as the player acts quickly enough. If a character loses all HP, it will become unconscious and cannot participate unless revived by another character. The player loses a battle if all characters become unconscious; the player will then be given the option to continue play from the nearest save point, but with half the DP on their person.|$|E
2500|$|The {{comparative}} DOFs of {{two different}} format sizes depend on {{the conditions of the}} comparison. The DOF for the smaller format can be either more than or less than that for the larger format. In the discussion that follows, it is assumed that the final images from both formats are the same size, <b>are</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> the same distance, and are judged with the same circle of confusion criterion. (Derivations of the effects of format size are given under Derivation of the DOF formulae.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{hind legs}} of the Gypsy Horse should display proper {{angulation}} for a pulling horse, although not to the degree found in larger feathered draught breeds such as the modern Shire and Clydesdale. Unlike the equine conformational flaw of cow-hockedness, where only the lower leg is turned outward, a Gypsy Horse's entire hind leg [...] is set so as to angle outward. As a result, when the hind legs of a horse set up squarely <b>are</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> the rear, their cannon bones appear parallel.|$|E

2500|$|Despite its {{classical}} references, {{the characterization}} of the figure is unconventional, and the depictions of her large stomach, hands and feet are derived from observation rather than respect for the idealised form. Alternatively, art historian Eric Jan Sluijter proposed that the figure {{could not have been}} painted directly from a posed model, given the anatomical discrepancies (an impossibly twisted left arm, the length of the right arm, an unnatural twist of the torso, and the elongated distance from breast to groin) and inconsistencies in perspective that indicate different parts of the figure <b>are</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> various vantage points. Yet, the figure appears to repose naturally, without tension or movement. Whatever physical awkwardness the figure may possess when compared to classical sources, the truthfulness of her image has been seen as extraordinarily noble; according to Clark, [...] "this Christian acceptance of the unfortunate body has permitted the Christian privilege of a soul".|$|E

6000|$|I had remarked, {{from the}} camp, palms unlike any I had seen before, {{starring}} the opposite forest with pale gray-green leaves. Long and earnestly I had scanned {{them through the}} glasses. Now {{was the time to}} see them close, and from beneath. I soon guessed (and rightly) that I was looking at that Palma de Jagua, {246} which excited--and no wonder--the enthusiasm of the usually unimpassioned Humboldt. [...] Magnificent as the tree is when its radiating leaves <b>are</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> above, it is even more magnificent when you stand beneath it. The stem, like that of the Coconut, usually curves the height of a man ere it rises in a shaft for fifty or sixty feet more. From the summit of that shaft springs a crown--I had rather say, a fountain-- of pinnated leaves; only eight or ten of them; but five-and-twenty feet long each. For three-fourths of their length they rise at an angle of 45 degrees or more; for the last fourth they fall over, till the point hangs straight down; and each leaflet, which is about two feet and a half long, falls over in a similar curve, completing the likeness of the whole to a fountain of water, or a gush of rockets. I stood and looked up, watching the innumerable curled leaflets, pale green above and silver-gray below, shiver and rattle amid the denser foliage of the broad-leaved trees; and then went on to another and to another, to stare up again, and enjoy the mere shape of the most beautiful plant I had ever beheld, excepting always the Musa Ensete, from Abyssinia, in the Palm-house at Kew. [...] Truly spoke Humboldt, of this or a closely allied species, 'Nature has lavished every beauty of form on the Jagua Palm.' ...|$|E
