25|$|When he was Professor of Law and Police at the College of William & Mary, Tucker used William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England as {{his primary}} text. While Tucker {{considered}} Blackstone the best treatise {{to use for}} learning the common law, he thought it had some important weaknesses as a teaching tool for American law. None of the editions of Blackstone published in the United States actually discussed new legal developments there; they just reprinted Blackstone's discussions of English law. Tucker also felt that Blackstone's sympathy {{with the power of}} the Crown over that of Parliament would be a poor influence for a student of American legal principles. Therefore, Tucker wrote marginalia in his copy of Blackstone and read them to his classes, and added lectures on Virginian and United States federal law and comparing the <b>American</b> <b>political</b> <b>system</b> with its British counterpart.|$|E
25|$|The {{performance}} of gold bullion is often compared to stocks as different investment vehicles. Gold is regarded {{by some as}} a store of value (without growth) whereas stocks are regarded as a return on value (i.e., growth from anticipated real price increase plus dividends). Stocks and bonds perform best in a stable political climate with strong property rights and little turmoil. The attached graph shows the value of Dow Jones Industrial Average divided by the price of an ounce of gold. Since 1800, stocks have consistently gained value in comparison to gold {{in part because of the}} stability of the <b>American</b> <b>political</b> <b>system.</b> This appreciation has been cyclical with long periods of stock outperformance followed by long periods of gold outperformance. The Dow Industrials bottomed out a ratio of 1:1 with gold during 1980 (the end of the 1970s bear market) and proceeded to post gains throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The gold price peak of 1980 also coincided with the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan and the threat of the global expansion of communism. The ratio peaked on January 14, 2000 a value of 41.3 and has fallen sharply since.|$|E

Rob Reiner directed. The film was critically acclaimed.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{importance of}} television within the modern political history of Latin America is a well-established fact, {{yet there are}} relatively few academic investigations that focus on analyzing the relationship between <b>political</b> <b>systems</b> and television models.

500|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, the Court began to {{interpret}} the amendment more broadly, striking down grandfather clauses in Guinn v. United States (1915) and dismantling the white primary system in the [...] "Texas primary cases" [...] (1927–1953). Along with later measures such as the Twenty-fourth Amendment, which forbade poll taxes in federal elections, and Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections (1966), which forbade poll taxes in state elections, these decisions significantly increased black participation in the <b>American</b> <b>political</b> <b>system.</b> To enforce the amendment, Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which provided federal oversight of elections in discriminatory jurisdictions, banned literacy tests and similar discriminatory devices, and created legal remedies for people affected by voting discrimination.|$|E
500|$|Eventually, Stanton's oppositional rhetoric took {{on racial}} overtones.

[...] Some scholars have argued that Stanton's emphasis on property ownership and education, opposition to black male suffrage, and desire to hold out for universal suffrage fragmented {{the civil rights movement}} by pitting African-American men against women and, together with Stanton's emphasis on [...] "educated suffrage," [...] in part established a basis for the literacy requirements that followed {{in the wake of the}} passage of the Fifteenth Amendment.|$|E

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{there has}} been an increase in protectionist attitudes among the US public in recent years. James Paterson’s article presents the differences between the Australian and <b>American</b> <b>political</b> <b>systems</b> that may explain the divergence in political intentions toward protectionism between the two nations. Australian and American voters share a suspicious attitude towards foreign trade and remain highly sceptical about its value. Yet, in Australia, politicians have shown a reluctance to use anti-trade rhetoric to gain votes. The US, on the other hand, has many politicians eager to demonise foreign trade and use the public’s fear of it for political benefit. In Australia, strong party discipline has acted as a brake on populist anti-market forces. Despite its faults, our current system has helped to maintain a political commitment to free trade that has benefited the country greatly...|$|R

2500|$|In 1960s United States, natural afro-textured {{hair was}} {{transformed}} from a simple expression of style into a revolutionary political statement. It became a fundamental tool of the Black movement in America, and [...] "air came to symbolize either a continued move toward integration in the <b>American</b> <b>political</b> <b>system</b> or a growing cry for Black power and nationalism." [...] Prior to this, the idealized Black person (especially Black women) [...] "had many Eurocentric features, including hairstyles."

500|$|On a {{more basic}} level, the novel also has {{political}} themes to it. As John Deiner writes, [...] "I, The Supreme is a surprisingly political novel. It is {{a commentary on}} Paraguay's first great political leader [...] and a condemnation of the country's last, General Alfredo Stroessner." [...] Deiner contends that the <b>political</b> <b>system</b> and occurrences in I, the Supreme are symbolic of those of other Paraguayan leaders. Suggesting the book is connected to more recent leaders of Paraguay, Deiner writes [...] "although ostensibly a fictionalized account {{of the life of}} El Supremo, the novel is also a thinly disguised attack on the politics and rule of Alfredo Stroessner, [...] ruling Paraguay at the time I, the Supreme was published (in exile) in 1974." [...] In summary, Deiner suggest that the novel [...] "serves as the quintessential example of the personalist dictator model of Latin <b>American</b> <b>political</b> <b>systems.</b> Francia's was one of the earliest versions of this model, and Stroessner's {{was one of the last}} personalist dictator regimes." ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the interaction between the}} rules governing presidential elections and multipartism in Latin America. Data from 16 Latin American systems are examined {{through the use of a}} multivariate model to gain an understanding of the independent impact of presidential electoral formula (plurality vs. majority), the timing of presidential and legislative elections (concurrent vs. nonconcurrent) and legislative district magnitude on legislative multipartism, and by extension, on the number of relevant political parties operating in the nation. The findings demonstrate the strong and significant impact which formula and timing have on multipartism. They also point to the importance of examining the interaction between elections for different constituent institutions. Finally, they underscore the applicability of Duverger’s law to presidential elections.

2500|$|The Squatter and the Don is Ruiz de Burton's {{most famous}} {{literary}} piece. [...] It was published anonymously under the pen name [...] "C. Loyal," [...] an abbreviated form of [...] "Ciudadano Leal," [...] or [...] "Loyal Citizen," [...] a conventional method of closing official letters in nineteenth century Mexico. [...] She used this name to symbolize her Mexican loyalties, to provide indeterminacy of her gender, and {{to criticize the}} <b>American</b> <b>political</b> <b>system.</b> [...] This novel adopts the narrative perspective of a conquered Californio population that [...] is a [...] "capable, cultured, even heroic people who were unjustly deterritorialized, economically strangled, linguistically oppressed, and politically marginalized" [...] despite the stipulations of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848, in which the United States agreed to respect the rights of Mexicans and Spanish citizens who were subsumed into the United States. [...] The story of The Squatter and the Don fictionally documents the many Californio families that lost their land due to squatters and litigation. This book discusses {{the consequences of the}} Land Act of 1851 and the railroad monopoly in California, covering the time period of 1872 to 1885. The novel demonstrates how the burden of proof of land ownership fell not on the US government, nor on the squatters who settled on the land, but on the Californio landowners.|$|E
