In written message traffic, the proword 'Y' is used to indicate a message having the authority to override all other traffic and is usually assigned to Emergency Action Messages (EAM).|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic pump/motor {{units have}} {{a wide range of}} commer-cial applications, each {{requiring}} a separate bolt-on hydraulic controller. This paper outlines the results of laboratory feasibility tests, aimed at replacing these hydraulic con-trollers with an electromechanical valve actuated by a universal microprocessor based controller. Since the majority of controller functions include <b>a</b> pressure <b>override</b> <b>capability,</b> the constant pressure override control (CPOC) function has been investigated in detail. The CPOC controller varies the pump flow rate to ensure that the hydraulic pipeline pres-sure remains constant despite variations in load. The micro-processor required an accurate measure of average line pressure. Preliminary tests showed that the axial pump superimposed large synchronous pressure ripples onto this average level. The results show that if careful signal con-ditioning is used to remove this ripple, a microprocessor based control unit can mimic the main control function of existing hydraulic controllers successfully. Design features required for a suitable prototype controller necessary for field trials are discussed. ...|$|R

On the earlier camera, the switch was located on the back, left-hand side. Also omitted from the later camera is a small lever under the shutter speed dial labeled [...] "Override" [...] on the earlier camera.

Burn-to- burn variations are managed through the identification of specific parameters that may be updated for each progressive burn. Failure triggers and automatic responses during the burn timeframe are defined to provide safety for the crew {{in the case of}} vehicle failures, along with <b>override</b> <b>capabilities</b> to ensure operational control of the vehicle.
