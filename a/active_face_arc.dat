Included, 20 patients have been made two denture sets, each on identical models; one of them was made by means of placing false teeth in individual articulator where recording of lower jaw movements was made using <b>face</b> <b>arc,</b> while the second set of dentures was made by means of our method of recording lower jaw movements. The dentures masticatory efficiency has been studied by means of Rubinov's masticatory test. It has been revealed that dentures made by the method suggested by us are characterized with high masticatory efficiency and are easy to accomplish both, for a dentist and a patient...|$|R

40|$|Methane {{and other}} {{hydrocarbon}} gases, byproducts of coalification, are emitted from coal at widely varying rates and often present ventilation problems during mining. The air in some coal mines apparently contains no methane. To determine if coals from mines {{which had no}} history of detectable gas emission contained adsorbed methane, samples of coal at the shaft bottom and at an <b>active</b> <b>face</b> were obtained and placed in sealed metal cylinders. The atmosphere around the coal was sampled and analysed by gas chromatography. Methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, and butane {{were found to have}} been desorbed from these coals. Hydrogen and helium were also detected. An estimate of the amount of residual gas per ton of coal indicated that coal samples from the <b>active</b> <b>face</b> generally contained more adsorbed gas than coal samples obtained from the shaft bottom, although in both instances the total amount of gas was relatively small...|$|R
40|$|Bird {{control at}} and around airfields is {{critical}} to safe airfield operation. Numerous bird-control products and strategies are available, {{all of which have}} limitations because of rapid habituation, ineffectiveness, expense or other factors. There is a need for new methods to manage birds at airports and other locations. In recent years, realistic effigies of dead turkey vultures (Cathartes aura) have proven effective as a species-specific means to disperse roosting vultures. To determine if this concept can be expanded to deter other birds that are a problem at airfields, we conducted trials using prepared ring-billed (Larus delawarensis) and herring (L. argentatus) gulls as effigies at landfills, a nesting colony, and a containment disposal facility (CDF) next to an airport. Results at landfills varied with distance to the active dumping area (<b>active</b> <b>face)</b> and time of year. In winter, gulls loafing away from the <b>active</b> <b>face</b> would stay clear of effigies for up to 4 weeks. When set on or adjacent to the <b>active</b> <b>face,</b> gulls would initially disperse but then return within hours to weeks. Effigies were not effective in nesting colonies. Gull reaction to effigies at a CDF showed initial good response, especially when reinforced with pyrotechnics and lethal control but habituation occurred after 2 months of exposure. We conclude that gull effigies can reduce gull presence in specified areas when used as part of an integrated bird control program. However, effigies alone will not keep gulls away from extensive areas...|$|R

40|$|Extrudate {{distortion}} is {{a problem}} that often limits production rates in certain commercial processes such as film blowing and {{it has been suggested that}} slip in the die land plays an important role in this phenomena. It has been hypothesized that during slip flow in a die neither the wall shear stress nor the slip velocity is constant along the length of the die. For this reason, a slit die rheometer was developed to monitor directly the shear stress distribution of a molten polyethylene by means of two shear stress transducers mounted at different axial locations along the length of the slit. Previous transducers used at McGill do not perform well at high pressures. Therefore, a new disk-bar shear stress transducer was designed for use at high pressure. However, experimental evaluation of the slit die rheometer suggests that the large pressure gradient present in the slit affects the operation of this transducer. It is hypothesized that the pressure gradient across the <b>active</b> <b>face</b> of the shear stress transducer and the disk element impose a torque opposite to that of the applied shear stress on the <b>active</b> <b>face.</b> This pressure gradient effect was unanticipated because no shear stress transducer has ever been used in a pressure driven flow. Before the research on wall slip can proceed a new shear stress transducer that is unaffected by either high pressure or large pressure gradients must be developed. Possible ways of meeting this need are proposed...|$|R
40|$|Tectonic reconstructions of the Caribbean Plate are {{severely}} hampered by {{a paucity of}} geochronologic and exhumation constraints from anastomosed basement blocks along its southern margin. New U/Pb, 40 Ar/ 39 Ar, apatite fission track, and apatite (U-Th) /He data constrain quantitative thermal and exhumation histories, which {{have been used to}} propose a model for the tectonic evolution of the emergent parts of the Bonaire Block and the southern Caribbean Plate boundary zone. An east <b>facing</b> <b>arc</b> system intruded through an oceanic plateau during ∼ 90 to ∼ 87 Ma and crops out on Aruba. Subsequent structural displacements resulted in > 80 °C of cooling on Aruba during 70 – 60 Ma. In contrast, exhumation of the island arc sequence exposed on Bonaire occurred at 85 – 80 Ma and 55 – 45 Ma. Santonian exhumation on Bonaire occurred immediately subsequent to burial metamorphism and may have been driven by the collision of a west <b>facing</b> island <b>arc</b> with the Caribbean Plate. Island arc rocks intruded oceanic plateau rocks on Gran Roque at ∼ 65 Ma and exhumed rapidly at 55 – 45 Ma. We attribute Maastrichtian-Danian exhumation on Aruba and early Eocene exhumation on Bonaire and Gran Roque to sequential diachronous accretion of their basement units to the South American Plate. Widespread unconformities indicate late Eocene subaerial exposure. Late Oligocene–early Miocene dextral transtension within the Bonaire Block drove subsidence and burial of crystalline basement rocks of the Leeward Antilles to ≤ 1 km. Late Miocene–recent transpression caused inversion and ≤ 1 km of exhumation, possibly {{as a result of the}} northward escape of the Maracaibo Block...|$|R
