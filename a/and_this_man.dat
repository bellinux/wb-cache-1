500|$|In 1968, Motley {{became the}} second black player voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, located in his {{hometown}} of Canton. Having played successfully as a fullback and pass blocker on offense and as a linebacker on defense, he is seen {{as one of the best}} all-around players in football history. Blanton Collier, an assistant who took over as the team's head coach after Paul Brown's firing in 1963, said Motley [...] "had no equal as a blocker. He could run with anybody for 30 yards or so. <b>And</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> was a great, great linebacker." ...|$|E
500|$|As Giuliani mulled {{over his}} medical options, on May 1 Hanover {{announced}} that she was postponing her appearance in The Vagina Monologues due to [...] "personal family circumstances." [...] On May 2 the New York Daily News published a brief item about Giuliani's other woman, without name or description. [...] On May 3 the New York Post finally published its photographs of Giuliani and the woman, now identified as Judith Nathan, leaving a restaurant together, under the front page headline [...] "Rudy's Mystery Brunch Pal is Upper East Side Divorcée". [...] (Some observers felt that Giuliani, known {{for his ability to}} manipulate the New York media, had been eager for news of the relationship to come out.) [...] Later that day, Giuliani responded to a barrage of questions on the subject at a news conference by acknowledging Judith Nathan publicly for the first time, calling her [...] "a very good friend" [...] and expressing his annoyance that her privacy was being invaded. [...] The next days were filled with New York media coverage on Nathan's background and on the relationship. [...] On May 6 Hanover held an unusually-located news conference at the back of St. Patrick's Cathedral before the funeral of Cardinal John O'Connor; visibly trembling, she said, [...] "I will be supportive of Rudy in his fight against his illness, as this marriage <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> have been very precious to me." [...] The following day half the press tried to stake out Nathan's known locations while the rest pestered Nathan's hometown relatives in Hazleton, Pennsylvania; Giuliani looked weak in a public appearance.|$|E
2500|$|Muslim cleric Abdul Raouf, {{a member}} of Afghanistan's main Islamic organization, the Afghan Ulama Council, stated [...] "Rejecting Islam is {{insulting}} God. We will not allow God to be humiliated. This man must die." [...] Raouf, who is described by the AP as [...] "moderate", is quoted as saying: [...] "Cut off his head!" [...] and [...] "We will call on the people to pull him into pieces so there's nothing left." [...] Raouf said Abdul Rahman will only survive if he goes into exile. During his sermon at Herati Mosque on March 24, 2006, Raouf told around 150 worshippers that Abdul Rahman deserved death since he had [...] "committed the greatest sin. God's way is the right way, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> whose name is Abdul Rahman is an apostate." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ōfuna had a {{reputation}} for intimidation and for torturing their inmates in an attempt to get military information, and was nicknamed the [...] "Torture Farm" [...] by its inmates. As the prisoners sent to Ōfuna were primarily officers, who might have inside knowledge of Allied Strategy, or others working in critical areas such as communications and submarines, it was the goal of the Japanese to extract as much information as possible in a short time. The names of the prisoners held at Ōfuna was not divulged to the Red Cross, and the camp was so secret that even local inhabitants were not aware of its existence. As relayed to a submarine prisoner: [...] "You have survived the sinking of a submarine. No one survives the sinking of a submarine. No one knows you're alive. We're going to ask you questions. This man <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> are going to shoot you if you don't answer the questions, and no one will know you were alive." [...] In some cases, the inmates were told by their captors that they were regarded as war criminals, since 90 percent of the crews of the merchant vessels sunk by American submarines were civilians, and that as war criminals, they would be given only half the rations as normal prisoners of war.|$|E
2500|$|Bouzes resurfaces in 539, when {{he succeeded}} the {{deceased}} Sittas {{in command of}} Roman Armenia. He was tasked with ending an ongoing Armenian revolt. His efforts included the assassination of John, a descendant of the Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia. John was survived by his son Artabanes. [...] "After the death of Sittas the emperor commanded Bouzes to go against the Armenians; and he, upon drawing near, sent to them promising to effect a reconciliation between the emperor and all the Armenians, and asking {{that some of their}} notables should come to confer with him on these matters. Now the Armenians as a whole were unable to trust Bouzes, nor were they willing to receive his proposals. But there was a certain man of the Arsacidae who was especially friendly with him, John by name, the father of Artabanes, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>man,</b> trusting in Bouzes as his friend, came to him with his son-in-law, Bassaces, and a few others; but when these men had reached the spot where they were to meet Bouzes on the following day, and had made their bivouac there, they perceived that they had come into a place surrounded by the Roman army. Bassaces, the son-in-law, therefore earnestly entreated John to fly. And since {{he was not able to}} persuade him, he left him there alone, and in company with all the others eluded the Romans, and went back again by the same road. And Bouzes found John alone and slew him; and since after this the Armenians had no hope of ever reaching an agreement with the Romans, and since they were unable to prevail over the emperor in war, they came before the Persian king led by Bassaces, an energetic man." [...] The events led to a new conflict between the Byzantine and Sassanid Empires.|$|E
2500|$|Tendulkar's {{allegations}} {{were supported by}} former teammates such as Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh and V. V. S. Laxman. Zaheer called Chappell a [...] "control freak" [...] and said, [...] "After he was appointed {{the coach of the}} Indian team, he once came upto me and told [...] "Zaheer, you will not be playing for India till I remain the coach". He also added that the two-year term under Chappell was [...] "easily the worst and darkest phase" [...] that he could remember. Harbhajan said, [...] "Chappell destroyed Indian cricket {{to such an extent that}} it required at least 3 years to again get back on track. The worst part was some players in that team, who sucked upto the coach and would supply selective misinformation creating bigger rifts". He also talked about the email leak, [...] "Sourav was batting out there in the middle <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>man</b> was typing a critical e-mail against Sourav, sitting right there in that dressing room. He had no interest in the proceedings of the match. There were seven guys that he wanted to get rid of. Sourav was his primary target followed by myself, Virender Sehwag, Ashish Nehra, Zaheer Khan and Yuvraj Singh". Laxman was also critical of Chappell in saying that Chappell took Indian cricket [...] "backwards" [...] during his coaching tenure. Laxman also recalled an incident from 2006, [...] "This happened in 2006 at the Wankhede Stadium when India played versus England. Yuvraj Singh was picked ahead of me. We were going to the West Indies for a four-Test series after that and he asked me if I would open. I mentioned in 2000 I had decided I would not open anymore after it didn't work for me in the first four years. I was consistent in the middle order since 2000. Chappell asked me my age and said - Don't you think 31 is too young an age to sit at home? I was astonished to hear this. I had a very good run under him. I was the second highest run scorer under him." ...|$|E
