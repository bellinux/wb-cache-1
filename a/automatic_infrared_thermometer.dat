The online {{temperature}} detections {{of fiber}} along the spinning line {{should be the}} important means for the precise controlling of fiber higher order structures as well as fiber-final performance. In this paper, a method of measurement fiber temperature has been introduced which mainly use the instrument of monochromatic <b>infrared</b> <b>thermometer</b> to measure fiber temperature in the melt-spinning processes. Due to the probe field of view of monochromatic <b>infrared</b> <b>thermometer</b> being {{much larger than the}} fiber diameter, monochrome <b>infrared</b> <b>thermometers</b> can't be used to measure temperature of fibers directly, the measurement results is an average between the fiber and backgrounds, which can't be used to indicate the temperature of fibers directly and have to calibrated. The calibrated results of monochromatic <b>infrared</b> <b>thermometer</b> are compared to the measurement results of infrared thermography. It has been found that the on-line measurement with <b>infrared</b> <b>thermometer</b> could promise high-speed and highly reliable temperature testing for the fibers...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} has been {{developed}} for measuring directional thermal emissivity {{as a function of}} view angle for plant canopies and soils using two <b>infrared</b> <b>thermometers</b> each sensitive to a different wavelength band. By calibrating the two <b>infrared</b> <b>thermometers</b> to 0. 1 C consistency, canopy directional emissivity can be estimated with typical errors less than 0. 005 in the 8 [...] 14 um wavelength band, depending on clarity of the sky and corrections for CO{sub 2 } absorption by the atmosphere. A theoretical justification for the method is developed along with an error analysis. Laboratory measurements were used to develop corrections for CO{sub 2 }, absorption and a field calibration method is used to obtain the necessary 0. 1 C consistency for relatively low cost <b>infrared</b> <b>thermometers.</b> The emissivity of alfalfa (LAI= 2. 5) and corn (LAI= 3. 2) was near 0. 995 and independent of view angle. Individual corn leaves had an emissivity of 0. 97. A wheat (LAI= 3. 0) canopy had an emissivity of 0. 985 at nadir and 0. 975 at 75 degree view angle. The canopy emissivity values tend to be higher than values in the literature, and are useful for converting <b>infrared</b> <b>thermometer</b> measurements to kinetic temperature and interpreting satellite thermal observations...|$|R

The researcher who used thermography, had thought that the low temperature area of the abdomen in the low abdominal area has some relation to Oketsu.

Thermoflash LX- 26 (France-China) thermometer was used for non-contact infrared mesasurement, MC- 203 -E (Omron Health Care, Europe) thermometer for digital measurement and glass mercury thermometer for conventional axillary measurement. A total of 6273 measurements were performed, being 2091 measurement for each method. Results: The mean results of the non-contact <b>infrared</b> forehead <b>thermometer,</b> mercury thermometers and digital thermometer were found as 37. 2 ± 0. 5 °C, 36. 7 ± 0. 4 °C, and 36. 6 ± 0. 4 °C respectively.
