A governess called [...] "Miss Kitty" [...] who came from across the Channel, instilled in him the love of - and competence in - the English language. The proctor caught him reading a book by Rimbaud or Mallarmé, and reprimanded him, [...] "Let's have no disorder in your studies!". Cartier-Bresson said, [...] "He used the informal 'tu', which usually meant you were <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> good thrashing. But he went on, 'You're going to read in my office.' Well, that wasn't an offer he had to repeat." ...|$|E
60|$|And at {{the words}} Michael bristled, dragged himself clear of the woman's detaining hands, and, with a snarl, whirled <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> look at the black boy who must have just then entered the room and aroused the white god's ire. But there was no black boy. He looked on, still bristling, to the door. Harley {{transferred}} his own gaze to the door, and Michael knew, beyond all doubt, that outside the door was standing a Solomons nigger.|$|E

Haven’t {{you ever seen}} me dodging <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> sight of you amongst those pretty gentlemen, on horseback, like a princess, with pure cheeks like a carved saint? I wonder I didn’t throw stones at you, I wonder I didn’t run after you {{shouting}} the tale—curse my timidity! But I daresay they knew as much as I did. More. All the new tricks—if that were possible.” ...|$|E

[...] Then he strutted {{up and down in the}} open space, turning now towards his fellows and again to Martin, moving his head <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> better sight of his face. Then, putting his hand down between his coat and waistcoat he drew out a knife with a long shining blade, and holding it from him looked attentively at it. By and by he breathed gently on the bright blade, then pulling out a black silk pocket handkerchief wiped off the stain of his breath, and turning the blade about made it glitter in the sun. Then he put it back under his coat and resumed his walk up and down.|$|E
6000|$|Some {{moments later}} I saw R.C. {{and the boy}} running and stooping and {{creeping}} {{along the bottom of}} the ravine. Then I ran myself to reach a point opposite the turkeys, so in case they flew uphill I might get a shot. But I did not see them, and nothing happened. I lost sight of the turkeys. Hurrying back to where I had tied my horse I mounted him and loped ahead and came out upon the ravine some distance above. Here I hunted around for a little while. Once I heard the report of the [...] .20 gauge, and then several rifle shots. Upon returning I found that Lee and Nielsen had wasted some shells. R.C. and Romer came wagging up the hill, both red and wet and tired. R.C. carried a small turkey, {{about the size of a}} chicken. He told me, between pants, that they chased the four large turkeys, and were just <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> shot when up jumped a hen-turkey with a flock of young ones. They ran every way. He got one. Then he told me, between more pants and some laughs, that Romer had chased the little turkeys all over the ravine, almost catching several. Romer said for himself: [...] "I just almost pulled feathers out of their tails. Gee! if I'd had a gun!" ...|$|E
60|$|We {{went first}} into the Gallery of British Painters, where there were {{hundreds}} of pictures, every one of which would have interested me by itself; but I could not fix nay mind on one more than another, so I wandered <b>about,</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> general idea of the Exhibition. Truly it is very fine; truly, also, every great show is a kind of humbug. I doubt whether there were half a dozen people there who got the kind of enjoyment that it was intended to create,--very respectable people they seemed to be, and very well behaved, but all skimming the surface, as I did, and none of them so feeding on what was beautiful as to digest it, and make it a part of themselves. Such a quantity of objects must be utterly rejected before you can get any real profit from one! It seemed like throwing away time to look twice even at whatever was most precious; and it was dreary to think of not fully enjoying this collection, the very flower of Time, which never bloomed before, and never, by any possibility, can bloom again. Viewed hastily, moreover, it is somewhat sad to think that mankind, after centuries of cultivation of the beautiful arts, can produce no more splendid spectacle than this. It is not so very grand, although, poor as it is, I lack capacity to take in even the whole of it.|$|E
