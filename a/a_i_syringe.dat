5000|$|Several {{hours after}} the initial story broke and a {{firestorm}} of press coverage brought down the Yale Daily News website, Yale College issued a press release affirming that the miscarriages and exhibit were performance art. In the press release, the university spokesperson revealed that rather than the alleged cube of miscarried remains, the performance had consisted in {{the invention of the}} story of their creation. [...] "Ms. Shvarts is engaged in performance art," [...] it read. [...] "Her art project includes visual representations, a press release and other narrative materials. She stated to three senior Yale University officials today, including two deans, that she did not impregnate herself and that she did not induce any miscarriages. The entire project is an art piece, a creative fiction designed {{to draw attention to the}} ambiguity surrounding form and function of a woman’s body." [...] Shvarts, in a guest article for the Yale Daily News maintained that she had conducted artificial inseminations as well as self-induced miscarriage procedures (although she was unaware of whether she was pregnant). For the past year, I performed repeated self-induced miscarriages … Using <b>a</b> needleless <b>syringe,</b> <b>I</b> would inject the sperm near my cervix within 30 minutes of its collection, so as to insure the possibility of fertilization.On the 28th day of my cycle, <b>I</b> would ingest <b>an</b> abortifacient, after which I would experience cramps and heavy bleeding. ... Because the miscarriages coincide with the expected date of menstruation (the 28th day of my cycle), it remains ambiguous whether the therewas ever a fertilized ovum or not.The reality of the pregnancy, both for myself and for the audience, is a matter of reading. Aliza Shvarts Robert Storr, dean of Yale's art school, threatened to ban Shvarts from displaying her project unless she wrote a confession attesting that the project was a fiction and that no human blood would be used.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe sweetpotato weevil, Cylas formicarius (F.) (Coleoptera: Brentidae), {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pests of sweet potatoes in the world. With free trade between the United States and the U. S. -controlled Mariana Islands, C. formicarius has spread along with this commodity. Because of the cryptic nature of the larvae and nocturnal activity of the adults, and the cancellation of long-residual pesticides, this pest has become increasingly difficult to control. Therefore, the present study sought to explore and to compare the effectiveness of Metarhizium brunneum F 52 (90 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), Beauveria bassiana GHA (40 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), spinosad (90 g <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), azadirachtin (1484 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), B. bassiana+M. brunneum (20 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha+ 45 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), B. bassiana+azadirachtin (20 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha+ 742 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), B. bassiana+spinosad (20 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha+ 45 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha), M. brunneum+azadirachtin (45 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha+ 742 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha) and M. brunneum+spinosad (45 ml <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha+ 45 grams <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> /ha) in controlling this pest in both the laboratory and the field. The treatment with B. bassiana+M. brunneum was the most effective in reducing tuber damage by C. formicarius, producing the highest yields.

40|$|A {{bioassay}} {{technique was}} developed to test the efficacy of insecticides against potato moth (Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller)) on tomatoes. The technique tested efficacy against both larvae in mines and neonate larvae {{that had not yet}} penetrated the leaf, and explained the failure of some insecticides to control P. operculella infestations in commercial tomato crops. Neonate larvae placed on leaves of potted plants several days before treatment provided larvae for testing of insecticides against larvae in mines; other neonates were placed on leaves after treatment to test efficacy against larvae yet to penetrate the leaf. The plants were sprayed with the candidate insecticides, held for 5 - 7 days, and larval mortality assessed. Chlorfenapyr (100, 200 g <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> ha- 1) and abamectin (8. 1 g <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> ha- 1) were effective against neonate larvae and larvae in mines.

They were accomplished in the harvests 2004 / 2005 and 2005 / 2006, surveys of use of insecticides through a questionnaire in 15 properties. Three experiments were developed in Chapadão do Sul (MS) city, in the period from January to December of 2005. The experimental design was randomized blocks with 8 treatments and 4 replicates (experiment 1 and 2) and 7 treatments and 4 replicates (experiment 3). The treatments in the experiment 1 were: 1) control; 2) methomyl (151 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 3) lambdacyhalothrin (7. 5 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 4) thiodicarb (160 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 5) lufenuron (7. 5 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 6) triflumuron (38. 4 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 7) alphacypermethrin + teflubenzuron (12. 7 + 12. 7 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1) and 8) spinosad (24 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1).

The treatments in the experiment 3, in the first and second application were respectively: 1) control; 2) thiodicarb and triflumurom (240 and 28. 8 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 3) lambdacyhalothrin and lufenuron (7. 5 and 15 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 4) alphacypermethrin and teflubenzuron (15 and 15 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 5) metomil and novaluron (151 and 15 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1); 6) alphacypermethrin + teflubenzuron (12. 7 + 12. 7 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1) and 7) profenofos + lufenuron (150 + 15 g <b>a.</b> <b>i</b> ha- 1).

This is {{in sharp contrast to}} most work on building ethical <b>A.</b> <b>I.,</b> which has focused on Utilitarian or Deontological ethical theories. We relate ethical <b>A.</b> <b>I.</b> to several core Stoic notions, including the dichotomy of control, the four cardinal virtues, the ideal Sage, Stoic practices, and Stoic perspectives on emotion or affect.

To this end, we introduce {{a notion of}} locally bounded approximate identity (<b>a.</b> <b>i.),</b> and we show that X is strictly flat {{if and only if}} the ideal <b>I</b> has <b>a</b> right locally bounded <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> An example is given of a commutative locally m-convex Fréchet algebra that has a locally bounded <b>a.</b> <b>i.,</b> but does not have <b>a</b> bounded <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> On the other hand, we show that a distinguished locally m-convex Fréchet algebra has a locally bounded <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> if and only if it has <b>a</b> bounded <b>a.</b> <b>i.</b> Some applications to amenable Fréchet algebras are also given. 1...|$|R
