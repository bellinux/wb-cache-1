5|$|It is {{estimated}} that 6.6 million people, mostly in Mexico, Central America and South America, have Chagas disease as of 2015. In 2015, Chagas was estimated to result in 8,000 deaths. Most people with the disease <b>are</b> <b>poor,</b> <b>and</b> most do not realize they are infected. Large-scale population movements have increased the areas where Chagas disease is found and these include many European countries and the United States. These areas have also seen {{an increase in the}} years up to 2014. The disease was first described in 1909 by the Brazilian physician Carlos Chagas, after whom it is named. Chagas disease is classified as a neglected tropical disease. It affects more than 150 other animals.|$|E

They mostly reside in southeastern parts Cambodia {{bordering}} Vietnam or on boathouses in the Tonlé Sap lake and Mekong rivers. The first Vietnamese came to settle modern-day Cambodia {{from the early}} 19th century during {{the era of the}} Nguyễn lords, and most of the Vietnamese came to Cambodia during the periods of French colonial administration and the People's Republic of Kampuchea administration. During the Khmer Republic and Khmer Rouge governments in the 1970s, the Vietnamese were targets of mass genocides; thousands of Vietnamese were killed and many more sought refuge in Vietnam. Ethnic relations between the Khmers and Vietnamese <b>are</b> <b>poor,</b> <b>and</b> the Vietnamese have been the main target of xenophobic attacks by political parties since the 1990s. Most of the Vietnamese are stateless residents of Cambodia, and as a result they face difficulties in getting access to education, employment and housing.|$|E

25|$|The {{high risk}} to bicycle users {{is due to}} a number of factors. Motorists tend to exhibit hostile attitudes towards bicycle riders. Bicycles are classed as 'vehicles', a {{transport}} class legally obliged to use the road, forcing bicycle users to mingle with heavy and fast-moving motor vehicles; only postal workers are legally permitted to ride on footpaths. Bicycle infrastructure and the standards underpinning bicycle infrastructure planning <b>are</b> <b>poor</b> <b>and</b> bicycles receive relatively very low levels of funding by both central and local government. It has also been argued that the introduction of New Zealand's compulsory bicycle helmet law contributed to the decline in the popularity of cycling.|$|E
25|$|The helminthic {{disease is}} {{so named because}} the {{infection}} is transmitted through ingestion of the nematode eggs in the soil, which is contaminated through excrements.

STH is categorised among neglected tropical diseases because it inflicts tremendous disability and suffering, which can be clinically treated and relatively easily be prevented (primarily through improved sanitation), yet negligible {{attention has been given}} for many years. It is now among the target diseases of London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases (launched on 30 January 2012) to be controlled/eradicated by 2020.|$|E

25|$|In October 2010, The Forward {{reported}} on {{the current state of}} Jews and the level of antisemitism in Sweden. Henrik Bachner, a writer and {{professor of history at the}} University of Lund, stated that members of the Swedish Riksdag have attended anti-Israel rallies where the Israeli flag was burned while the flags of Hamas and Hezbollah were waved, and the rhetoric was often antisemitic—not just anti-Israel. Charles Small, former director of the Yale University Initiative for the Study of Anti-Semitism, stated that “Sweden is a microcosm of contemporary anti-Semitism. It’s a form of acquiescence to radical Islam, which is diametrically opposed to everything Sweden stands for.” Per Gudmundson, chief editorial writer for Svenska Dagbladet and well known for his pro-Israeli stance for decades, has sharply criticised politicians who he says offer “weak excuses” for Muslims accused of antisemitic crimes. “Politicians say these kids <b>are</b> <b>poor</b> <b>and</b> oppressed, and we have made them hate. They are, in effect, saying that the behaviour of these kids is in some way our fault.” Much of the anti-semitism in the country has been attributed to the growing Muslim immigrant population.|$|E
25|$|The Circassian women have, {{from time}} immemorial, communicated the small-pox to their {{children}} when not above six months old by making an incision in the arm, and by putting into this incision a pustule, taken carefully {{from the body of}} another child. This pustule produces the same effect in the arm it is laid in as yeast in a piece of dough; it ferments, and diffuses through the whole mass of blood the qualities with which it is impregnated. The pustules of the child in whom the artificial small-pox has been thus inoculated are employed to communicate the same distemper to others. There is an almost perpetual circulation of it in Circassia; and when unhappily the small-pox has quite left the country, the inhabitants of it are in as great trouble and perplexity as other nations when their harvest has fallen short... The Circassians <b>are</b> <b>poor,</b> <b>and</b> their daughters are beautiful, and indeed, it is in them they chiefly trade. They furnish with beauties the seraglios of the Turkish Sultan, of the Persian Sophy, and of all those who are wealthy enough to purchase and maintain such precious merchandise.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} years of Evans' tenure, the Klan reached record enrollment; {{estimates}} of its peak range from 2.5to 6million members, although records <b>are</b> <b>poor</b> <b>and</b> the figure cannot be accurately determined. He also dramatically increased the organization's total assets, more than doubling them from July 1922 to July 1923. Evans changed the way that chapter leaders were paid: he insisted that they receive a fixed salary rather than commissions based on membership fees in a move that lowered their income. Although previous Imperial Wizards had lived in lavish properties, Evans initially settled in an apartment after his promotion. The sociologist Rory McVeigh of the University of Notre Dame argues that this increase in membership was owing to the Klan's exploitation of a [...] "favorable political context", particularly one in which native-born white-settler Americans were fearful after increased immigration caused them to compete for jobs and housing in many cities. Evans had high hopes for the Klan, saying in 1923 that he aimed to reach ten million members. That year, he spoke at the largest Klan gathering in history, a Fourth of July meeting in rural Indiana that was attended by over 200,000.|$|E

500|$|Certain {{songs were}} {{inspired}} by {{the effects of the}} late-2000s recession and Hunt's experience in North Hollywood, a district marked by population density, low income, and other recession-related issues. Hunt said of the district, [...] "There's so many issues resulting from the recession. People <b>are</b> <b>poor</b> <b>and</b> struggling." [...] He cited North Hollywood's [...] " [...] aesthetic" [...] as an inspiration for the songwriting: [...] "It's kind of stepchild, not just to Hollywood but Studio City and Sherman Oaks. North Hollywood isn't particularly small, but it doesn't carry the same weight as the other places around it." [...] Greg Kot calls Hunt's compositions [...] "frisky and playful", and writes that most of the album's lyrical setting is North Hollywood [...] "in decline, populated with hustlers, two-timers ... Money is tight and girlfriends are fickle. Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times comments that much of the album [...] "deals with economic difficulties and its effect on self-identity and love", and writes of its North Hollywood theme, [...] "Songs about or set in Los Angeles aren't a rarity. Yet amid the glamour, the noir and the inner-city grit lies plenty of unexplored territory. Van Hunt spends a significant portion of [...] traversing it." [...] Of Hunt's perspective on the album, Martens writes that [...] " [...] idea of beauty may be somewhat twisted ... informed by artistic roadblocks and career rejection".|$|E

[...] Winthrop's son Henry Winthrop missed the Arbella sailing and ended up on the Talbot, which also sailed from Wight. [...] Winthrop wrote a sermon entitled A Modell of Christian Charity, which was delivered either before or during the crossing. [...] It described the ideas and plans to keep the Puritan society strong in faith, while also comparing the struggles {{that they would have to}} overcome in the New World with the story of Exodus. In it, he used the now-famous phrase [...] "City upon a Hill" [...] to describe the ideals to which the colonists should strive, and that consequently [...] "the eyes of all people are upon us." [...] He also said, [...] "In all times some must be rich some poore, some highe and eminent in power and dignitie; others meane and in subjection"; that is, all societies include some who are rich and successful and others who <b>are</b> <b>poor</b> <b>and</b> subservient—and both groups were equally important to the colony because both groups were members to the same community.|$|E
