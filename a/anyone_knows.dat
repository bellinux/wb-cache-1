25|$|It emerges {{that this}} {{messenger}} was formerly a shepherd on Mount Cithaeron, {{and that he}} was given a baby, which the childless Polybus then adopted. The baby, he says, was given to him by another shepherd from the Laius household, who had been told {{to get rid of the}} child. Oedipus asks the chorus if <b>anyone</b> <b>knows</b> who this man was, or where he might be now. They respond that he is the same shepherd who was witness to the murder of Laius, and whom Oedipus had already sent for. Jocasta, who has by now realized the truth, desperately begs Oedipus to stop asking questions, but he refuses and Jocasta runs into the palace.|$|E

[...] Jackson was also [...] criticized for filming and recording his solo piece privately, away from the other artists.|$|E

I think if I were to focus on making a Grandaddy record [...] a full-blown Grandaddy record, and I {{like the idea of}} that. I'd like to give it a shot." [...] In early 2013, Lytle elaborated: [...] "I love the idea of making another Grandaddy record, but I wouldn't want it hanging over my head like 'Okay, you made this record, now are you guys going {{to get out there and}} tour in support of it?'... I'm hoping for this dream scenario where I can make Grandaddy records every so often and not have all this messy stuff that goes along with it.

500|$|After Budington and the {{remainder}} of the crew were rescued and returned to the United States, the board of inquiry continued. Budington attacked Tyson's credibility, disputing Tyson's claim that he had obstructed Hall's efforts to sail the ship further north. He also disputed reports of his drinking, saying that he [...] " [...] it a practice to drink but very little". Bessels was questioned about Hall's cause of death. Bessels stated that [...] "My idea of the cause of the first attack is that he had been exposed to very low temperature during the time that he was on the sledge journey. He came back and entered a warm cabin without taking off his heavy fur clothing, and then took a warm cup of coffee. And <b>anyone</b> <b>knows</b> what the consequences of that might be." [...] Bessels testified that Hall was [...] "taken by hemiplegia", and his left arm and side were paralyzed, and that he had injected Hall with quinine to correct his elevated temperature before he died.|$|E

Robida had a swastika tattoo and flaunted Nazi insignias and paraphernalia on his website. On February 5, Robida shot and killed a traffic officer during a routine stop. When police pulled Robida over during a later stop, he killed his girlfriend, Jennifer Bailey of Charleston, West Virginia, then opened fire on the police. Robida was shot twice in the head during the shootout with the police, and later died in the hospital. On February 7, Insane Clown Posse released a statement on the Robida attacks. The group's manager Alex Abbiss extended Bruce and Utsler's condolences and prayers {{to the families of}} the victims, stating that [...] "It's quite obvious that this guy had no clue what being a Juggalo is all about.

500|$|... "Say Yes" [...] is an uptempo gospel {{song with}} {{elements}} of pop music. The song was also noted for exploring elements of Contemporary Christian {{as well as}} electronic dance music. Jeff Benjamin of Fuse felt that the song contained a [...] "zippy", reggae-dance beat. Its instrumentation includes percussion instruments, synths and horn stabs along with African beats. According to sheet music published on the website Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing America, Inc., [...] "Say Yes" [...] is written in the key of D major using common time. It contains a moderately fast tempo with a metronome of 120 beats per minute and the singers' vocal elements range from the low note of A3 to the high note of F5. The song samples a popular Nigerian gospel tune originally titled [...] "When Jesus Says Yes". Chris Payne and Colin Stutz of Billboard magazine {{described it as a}} modern dance and contemporary electronic dance reworking of that song. Stutz also found elements of an [...] "upbeat swing" [...] of West African gospel. Regarding the composition of the song, Williams stated, [...] "It is a song that came from Africa {{more than a hundred years}} ago. I don't think <b>anyone</b> <b>knows</b> who wrote it or who started singing that chorus. When the song leaked last week, so many people from Africa and Nigeria were trying to let me know where it came from." ...|$|E

Chief Miles remembers one year that was particularly hard, [...] "We couldn't find anything, no deer, no turkeys--nothing. My dad was chief then, and we knew we had to have something to present to the governor; so we went to a turkey farm, bought a live turkey, brought it back to the reservation and killed it. That way we were able to fulfill the terms of the treaty--after all it was killed on the reservation." [...] As far as <b>anyone</b> <b>knows,</b> they have not missed a payment in 331 years.|$|E

Positive reviews came from GamesRadar, calling it [...] "one {{of the strongest}} entries in the series to date", and Game Informer, who wrote that [...] "devising a strategy, using the environment and disguises to your advantage, and leaving before <b>anyone</b> <b>knows</b> you’re there are the hallmarks of a perfect hit, and Absolution proves Agent 47 is still gaming's premier hitman." [...] The Daily Mail gave the game a 4/5, with particular praise being given to the game's varied environments, of which they remarked that [...] "whether it's walking along the sun-kissed balcony of a beach-side villa, or exploring the dank, underground sewers below a nightclub, Absolution brings each world to life with remarkable aplomb." ...|$|E
