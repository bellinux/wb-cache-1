Its effects in humans start at concentrations lower than hydrogen cyanide's 50 ppm and {{are similar to}} those of chlorine: significant irritation of the eyes and respiratory system as well as liver and kidney damage occur above 25 ppm, which is the immediately dangerous to life and health value for fluorine. Eyes and noses <b>are</b> <b>seriously</b> damaged at 100 ppm, and inhalation of 1,000 ppm fluorine will cause death in minutes, compared to 270 ppm for hydrogen cyanide.|$|E
