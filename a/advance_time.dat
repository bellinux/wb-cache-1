As the Ottoman III Corps (Seventh Army) reached Jerusalem via the Hebron road after its defeat at Beersheba, it was ordered to develop defences around Jerusalem.

40|$|Koga {{irrigation}} {{scheme was}} developed to irrigate about 7004 ha. Furrow irrigation is the recommended method for the distribution of water. However, furrow irrigation has inherent inefficiencies due to deep percolation on the upper end and runoff {{at the lower end}} of the furrow. These losses depend on furrow length, furrow gradient, surface roughness, stream size and cutoff time. These factors play significant role to influence the <b>advance</b> <b>time</b> of irrigation and the operation rule of the scheme. This paper examines the <b>advance</b> <b>time</b> of furrow irrigation at Koga. The experiment was conducted during 2012 irrigation season in two periods (February and April). The <b>advance</b> <b>time</b> of irrigation was monitored at three discharge rates and four furrow gradients at 90 – 110 m furrow length. The required discharge was measured using RBC flume. The average <b>advance</b> <b>time</b> at respective discharge rates of 0. 3, 0. 6 and 0. 8 litre/sec range from 290 – 460 min, 150 – 437 min and 100 – 294 min during 1 st irrigation; and 115 – 370 min, 78 – 189 min and 43 – 217 min during 2 nd irrigation. The <b>advance</b> <b>time</b> vary greatly among the discharge rates when the furrow length increases. The <b>advance</b> <b>time</b> of water at 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0 and 2. 5 % gradients was 236, 181, 197 and 398 min at 1 st irrigation and 163, 175, 220 and 88 min at 2 nd irrigation respectively. Furrow gradients and surface irregularities result in great variation of <b>advance</b> <b>time.</b> The <b>advance</b> <b>time</b> becomes shorter when the field gets smoother during 2 nd irrigation. Under non-levelled and irregular field conditions, 0. 6 – 0. 8 litre/sec application rate can be suggested to irrigate 30 – 40 m furrow lengths in order to improve application efficiency above 60 % and to optimize the daily operation rule of the overall scheme. The result of this study indicates the relevance of examining the furrow length, discharge and application time recommended in the feasibility study of irrigation schemes...|$|E

We hypothesized that PAM would lengthen ad-vance time, but that interactions with flow rate and wheel-track (WT) Ihrrows would occur, influencing erosion and infiltration with poten-tial for improved water management. A 2 -yr study conducted on 1. 5 % slope Portneuf soil (Dnrinodic Xeric Haplocalcid) was irrigated with 10 g tn- 1 PAM in advancing 23 L min- 1 furrow streams (reduced to 19 L min- 1 after advance) (PAM treatment, 11) or without PAM (control, C). Initial inflows in 1994 were 23 L min- 1 (normal flow rate, N) or 45 L min- 1 (high flow rate, H) with or without PAM. The application of PAM at 23 L min- 1 (PN) increased 2 -yr mean <b>advance</b> <b>time</b> 33 % and reduced runoff soil loss 88 % compared with controls (CN). Polyacrylamide applied at 45 L min- ' (PH) reduced <b>advance</b> <b>time</b> 8 % and soil loss 75 % compared with CN, whereas untreated 45 L min- 1 inflows (CH) cut <b>advance</b> <b>time</b> 42 % but raised soil loss 158 %.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to assess the effect of tillage on water advance and water distribution in the root zone area (0. 5 m) under continuous and surge flow irrigation in a cotton field. The experiment was conducted at the Agriculture Experimental Station, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt. The location was classified as clay soil. The furrows with blocked ends were 76 cm long and 0. 70 m wide with 0. 0024 m m- 1 of slope. To monitor the <b>advance</b> <b>time,</b> six points were established along the furrows at 9, 18, 27, 36, 45 and 76 m from the inlet. In order to study the water distribution along the furrows, soil moisture content was measured using the gravimetric method at 0 - 0. 25 and 0. 25 - 0. 50 m depths at the beginning, middle {{and end of the}} furrows. A hand hoeing tillage system (HH) was compared with a weed control tillage system (WC) under continuous flow (CF) and surge flow irrigation (SF). Hand hoeing tillage decreased the water <b>advance</b> <b>time</b> compared to weed control tillage either under continuous or surge flow irrigation. Surge flow also decreased the <b>advance</b> <b>time</b> compared to continuous flow. The greatest effect on the <b>advance</b> <b>time</b> reduction resulted from the combined effect of surge flow with tillage (SFHH), which reduced the total supplied water by 22. 4 and 25. 7 % during the first and second irrigation, respectively. The single effect of either tillage (CFHH) or surging (SFWC) also reduced the total amount of supplied water compared to continuous flow with weed control tillage (CFWC), but the reduction was less than that in the combined treatments.

Combining surge irrigation and tillage could be an efficient method to use irrigation water efficiently and ensure uniform distribution of soil wate...|$|E
40|$|Several studies {{carried out}} in long furrows have shown that surge flow {{irrigation}} offers the potential of increasing the efficiency of irrigation. The effects of surge flow in short fields, such as in Egypt, are still not well known, however. To investigate the effect of surge flow irrigation in short fields a series of experiments {{have been carried out}} at two different locations in Egypt. The first location with a clay soil was situated at the Agriculture Experimental Station, Assiut University, Assiut. The second location with a sandy soil was situated at the Assiut University Experimental Station for Desert Land, El-Wadi El-Assuity, Assiut. The blocked end furrow lengths and widths were 70 and 0. 70 m respectively. Three discharges were selected for each soil type, namely 0. 46, 0. 74 and 0. 90 l s- 1 for clay soil and 0. 73, 1. 0 and 1. 4 l s- 1 for sandy soil. For each discharge two cycle times were investigated, namely 16 and 24 minutes. For each cycle time three cycle ratios were chosen, 1 / 4, 1 / 2 and 3 / 4 for the 16 -minute and 1 / 3, 1 / 2, and 2 / 3 for the 24 -minute cycle time. The water content was measured at three locations, namely at the beginning, middle and end of the furrow. In each location three points were measured in a vertical line at a depth of 0 - 0. 1, 0. 1 - 0. 3 and 0. 3 - 0. 7 m. The results show that surge flow irrigation leads to a more uniform water distribution along the furrows than continuous flow. This uniformity is more pronounced in clay soil than in sandy soil. Surge flow irrigation decreases the <b>advance</b> <b>time</b> in comparison to continuous flow. The reduction in <b>advance</b> <b>time</b> was more pronounced with the discharges of 0. 74 and 1. 0 l s- 1 in clay and sandy soil respectively. The 24 -minute cycle time is better than the 16 -minute cycle time. The reduction in <b>advance</b> <b>time</b> with a cycle time of 24 minutes is due to the effect of the off-time. Different cycle ratios can be used but the 1 / 3 cycle ratio may be the best. In conclusion, surge flow irrigation under the short field conditions as prevailing in Egypt decreases the <b>advance</b> <b>time,</b> increases uniformity and efficiency by decreasing deep percolation and reduces applied water volume by 15 - 35...|$|E

A numerical model to evaluate furrow irrigation performance was developed and tested. The MacCormack scheme, which is a second order accurate explicit finite difference method, was utilized to solve the complete form of the continuity and momentum equations for unsteady gradually varied flow in a furrow. On the furrow boundaries, the method of characteristics in conjunction with the boundary conditions was utilized to solve the furrow flow equation. The model was tested by comparing predicted advance times, recession times, and outflow hydrographs with field data. Field data were collected from four different locations in Texas and Colorado. The measured data included a variety of soil types, flowrates, furrow lengths, and times of cutoff. The modified Kostiakov equation was utilized to describe the infiltration process. The model accurately predicted <b>advance</b> <b>time.</b> In three of the data sets the average absolute error of <b>advance</b> <b>time</b> was less than 5 %. The model did a reasonably good job of predicting recession times. The shape of predicted outflow hydrographs matched the shape of observed outflow hydrographs.
