40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} to {{support the hypothesis that}} the cochleae of young animals are more susceptible to <b>auditory</b> <b>trauma</b> than the cochleae of the adult. A sensitive period of heightened susceptibility to acoustic trauma from noise exposure has been demonstrated in three mammalian species. The cochlear pathology associated with this trauma is severe damage to the outer hair cell system. Abnormal growth of auditory evoked responses recorded in central auditory nuclei accompanies the receptor damage during the sensitive period. There is evidence of a similar sensitive period of susceptibility to cochlear insult from ototoxic drugs. The time frame of the sensitive period may be different for drug or noise insult to the cochlea, but the principal pathology of outer hair cell loss remains the same in both cases. The implication of these sensitive periods to <b>auditory</b> <b>trauma,</b> for human development is considered...|$|E
40|$|An automatic, {{computerized}} method {{was developed to}} classify results from a screening of employees exposed to noise, resulting in a fast and effective method of identifying and taking measures against <b>auditory</b> <b>trauma.</b> This technique also satisfies {{the urgent need for}} quick discovery of cases which deserve compensation in accordance with the Law on Industrial Accident Insurance. Unfortunately, use of this method increases the burden on the already overloaded investigatory resources of the auditory health care system...|$|E
40|$|Hypothesis: The {{role of the}} corticofugal efferent {{auditory}} {{system in}} the origin or maintenance of tinnitus is currently mostly overlooked. Changes in the balance between excitation and inhibition after an <b>auditory</b> <b>trauma</b> are likely {{to play a role}} in the origin of tinnitus. The efferent auditory system can be expected to be involved in such changes. Background: The goal of this article was to investigate the current knowledge of the functional efferent auditory system in humans, mostly based on animal research, and to look for new possibilities to try to answer the question of the specific role(s) of the corticofugal efferent auditory system in tinnitus. Methods: Literature review. Results: Several suggestions for future research are made, for studies in humans as well as in animals. Conclusion: We think that it will be worthwhile to investigate the efferent auditory system and its relations to tinnitus in the near future. With this article, we hope to inspire such work...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{neuronal}} spontaneous firing {{rates have}} been observed throughout the central <b>auditory</b> system after <b>trauma</b> to the cochlea and this hyperactivity {{is believed to be}} associated with the phantom perception of tinnitus. Previously we have shown in an animal model of hearing loss, that an acute injection with furosemide can significantly decrease hyperactivity after cochlear trauma and eliminate behavioural evidence of tinnitus of early onset. However, furosemide also has the potential to affect cochlear thresholds. In this paper we measured the effects of a chronic (daily injections for 7 days) furosemide treatment on the spontaneous firing rate of inferior colliculus neurons and on cochlear thresholds in order to establish whether a beneficial effect on hyperactivity can be obtained without causing additional hearing loss. Guinea pigs were exposed to a 10 kHz, 124 dB, 2 hour acoustic trauma, and after 5 days of recovery, were given daily i. p. injections of 80 mg/kg furosemide or an equivalent amount of saline. The activity of single IC neurons was recorded 24 hours following the last injection. The furosemide treatment had no effect on cochlear thresholds compared to saline injections but did result in significant reductions in spontaneous firing rates recorded in inferior colliculus. These results that suggest a long term beneficial effect of furosemide on hyperactivity after cochlear trauma may be achievable without detrimental effects on hearing, which is important when considering therapeutic potential...|$|R
40|$|The {{auditory}} epithelium {{in birds}} and mammals consists of a postmitotic population of hair cells and supporting cells. Unlike mammals, birds can regenerate their <b>auditory</b> epithelia after <b>trauma.</b> Recent evidence indicates that supporting cells undergo mitosis after acoustic trauma, suggesting that supporting cells may transdifferentiate into hair cells. The goals {{of this study were}} to (1) characterize the responses of hair cells and supporting cells to acoustic trauma, and (2) determine whether hair cell loss is a prerequisite for generation of new hair cells. Chicks were exposed to an octave-band noise and their inner ears assayed with fluorescence or scanning electron microscopy. In one area of the basilar papilla, defined as the center of the lesion, extensive hair cell degeneration occurred. Expanded supporting cells obliterated degenerating hair cells and invaded spaces normally occupied by hair cells. Aggregates of DNA were found within the basilar papilla, suggesting that hair cell death and disintegration may occur within the epithelium. The epithelial sheet appeared structurally confluent at all times examined. Supporting cells exhibited altered apical contour in distal regions of the basilar papilla, where hair cell damage was mild or inconspicuous. Four days after noise exposure, newly generated hair cells were found {{in the center of the}} lesion and in the distal areas, where no hair cell loss could be detected. The results suggest that supporting cells may play an important role in maintenance and repair of the traumatized basilar papilla and raise the possibility that production of new hair cells is not dependent on hair cell loss in the immediate vicinity...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study an animal model to study tinnitus-related changes in brain {{metabolism}} was established. 2 -deoxy-D-[14 C]-glucose (2 -DG) uptake served to screen metabolic activity in the entire mouse brain two hours and two weeks after unilateral noise trauma. Tinnitus perception was evaluated using {{a modified version of}} the acoustic startle paradigm, in which a short gap was embedded in the constant background noise to inhibit the startle amplitude. An arg 3. 1 conditional knockout mouse line was used to evaluate the influence of neuronal plasticity on the generation of tinnitus. Moreover, social interaction was tested to detect signs of emotional stress due to phantom sound perception, which is very common in tinnitus patients. After unilateral noise <b>trauma,</b> <b>auditory</b> brain stem responses (ABR) revealed a permanent threshold shift on the exposed ear. This particularly affected frequencies above the trauma stimulus frequency. Noise exposed animals exhibited a reduction of 2 -DG uptake along the afferent auditory pathway on the exposed side. In contrast, elevated activity was detected in the striatum, the somatosensory cortex, the cingulate gyrus (CG), orbitofrontal cortex, insula cortex, superior colliculus and the cerebellum. 71 % of noise exposed animals demonstrated indications of phantom sound perception via the startle paradigm. Of these, 28 % showed signs of phantom sound perception within a broad frequency range, 24 % in a narrow frequency range below the trauma frequency and 48 % within a narrow frequency range above the trauma frequency. In 19 % of noise exposed animals, tinnitus perception seemed to occur in more than one frequency band. The group of tinnitus perceiving animals showed a reduction in 2 -DG uptake in the contralateral auditory cortex, whereas animals with signs of phantom sound perception in the narrow frequency bands had an elevated uptake in the ipsilateral auditory cortex. Furthermore, activity changes were detected in the contralateral hippocampus, ipsilateral amygdala, cingulate gyrus, striatum, nucleus accumbens, olfactory bulb, colliculus superior and the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). When comparing noise exposed animals with and without behavioural indications for tinnitus, I observed differences in the ipsilateral striatum, CG, superior colliculus, globus pallidus, the contralateral TRN and cochlear nucleus. Unfortunately, arg 3. 1 knockout mice showed an altered glucose metabolism in the control state. Hence, a discussion of noise trauma-induced activity changes in these knockout animals is not possible. As 82 % of arg 3. 1 knockout mice exhibited behavioural signs for an auditory phantom perception, a reduced prevalence for tinnitus generation in this group could not be detected. In all noise exposed animals, the social interaction test demonstrated no indications of stress caused by the auditory phantom sound perception. The established model allows for the first time the investigation of tinnitus specific activity patterns in the entire brain of awake mice. The observed changes discussed above comprise a distributed network that consists of auditory, limbic and multimodal brain regions. Moreover, the data demonstrate that tinnitus perception might be triggered by alterations in interhemisperic and corticofugal projections. The presented data is in line with recent human imaging studies and supports the hypothesis that a complex distributed network is responsible for the generation of tinnitus...|$|R
40|$|The hormone {{estradiol}} {{affects the}} auditory system both by itself and by its interaction with neuroprotective factors. In this study, {{we examined the}} role of estrogen receptors (ERs) in response to <b>auditory</b> <b>trauma.</b> We found a ligand-dependent protective role for ERβ in the auditory system by investigating mice deficient in ERα (ERKO mice), ERβ (BERKO mice), and aromatase (ARKO mice). Basal auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds were similar in all animals. An acoustic trauma causing a temporary hearing loss raised ABR thresholds in male and female BERKO and ARKO mice compared with WT and ERKO mice. The ERα-selective agonist, propyl(1 H) pyrazole- 1, 3, 5 -triyl-trisphenol (PPT), partially protected ARKO mice from trauma, while the ERβ-selective agonist, 2, 3 -bis (4 -hydroxyphenyl) -propionitrile (DPN), protected WT and ARKO mice. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting confirmed the expression of ERβ in cochlea of WT males and females. Levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neuroprotective peptide that can be induced by estrogen, was lower in BERKO and ARKO mice compared with WT. DPN treatment increased BDNF expression in ARKO mice. These data indicate ERβ-mediated neuroprotection involving BDNF in the auditory system of males and females...|$|E
40|$|Aminoglycoside-induced {{cochlear}} ototoxicity causes {{hair cell}} (HC) loss {{and results in}} hearing impairment in patients. Previous studies have developed {{the concept of an}} ototoxicity-sensitive period during which the cochleae of young mice are more vulnerable to <b>auditory</b> <b>trauma</b> than adults. Here, we compared neomycin-induced ototoxicity at the following four developmental ages in mice: postnatal day (P) 1 –P 7, P 8 –P 14, P 15 –P 21, and P 60 –P 66. We found that when neomycin was administered between P 8 and P 14, the auditory brainstem response threshold increase was significantly higher at low frequencies and HC loss was significantly greater in the apical turn of the cochlea compared to neomycin administration during the other age ranges. qPCR data revealed that the expression of apoptotic markers, including Casp 3 and Casp 9, was significantly higher when neomycin was injected from P 8 to P 14, while the expression of the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) gene was significantly higher when neomycin was injected from P 60 to P 66. Because XIAP expression was low during the neomycin-sensitive period, we overexpressed XIAP in mice and found that it could protect against neomycin-induced hearing loss at low frequencies and HC loss in the apical turn of the cochlea. Altogether, our findings demonstrate a protective role for XIAP against neomycin-induced hearing loss and HC loss in the apical turn of the cochlea during the ototoxic-sensitive period, and suggest that apoptotic factors mediate the effect of neomycin during the ototoxic-sensitive period...|$|E
40|$|The present thesis {{explored}} the neurobiological basis of three aspects of defense behaviors in humans. Positron emission tomography methodology was used, {{and changes in}} regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were measured as an index of neural activity. Firstly, brain function was studied {{in a group of}} patients suffering from combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder, using a symptom provocation paradigm with combat sounds in order to elicit fear. Exposure to <b>auditory</b> <b>trauma</b> reminders relative to neutral sounds was associated with increased rCBF in sensorimotor areas, the cerebellar vermis, the periaqueductal gray matter, and the right amygdala, whereas decreased activity was observed in the retrosplenial area of the posterior cingulate cortex. Secondly, the neural circuitry mediating the acoustic startle response and its habituation was studied in a group of healthy subjects. During acoustic startle stimulation as compared to a resting condition, increased rCBF was found in a medial posterior area of the pons corresponding to the nucleus reticularis pontis caudalis. As a result of startle repetition, altered activity was found in the cerebellum, pointing to its involvement in startle habituation. Thirdly, neural activity associated with startle modulation by phobic fear was studied in a group of subjects with specific animal phobias during exposure to pictures of their feared and non-feared objects, paired and unpaired with acoustic startle stimuli. As a result of startle potentiation, increased rCBF was found in the left amygdaloid-hippocampal region, and medially in the affective division of the anterior cingulate cortex. In conclusion, these results provide evidence for the involvement of limbic and paralimbic brain areas during fear provocation and fear-potentiated startle and for a similar neurocircuitry underlying startle in humans and animals...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Background. Hearing loss {{has been}} {{described}} in patients with chronic renal failure on regular dialysis treatment (RDT) with very different frequency, ranging from 20 to 75 %; RDT {{does not seem to}} worsen hearing function for at least the first 5 years of treatment; no studies are available on patients on RDT for more than 10 years. Methods. We performed an audiometric evaluation in 91 patients on RDT for various periods: group I (34 patients), 10 years; patients with histories of chronic otitis, ototoxic drug treatment, and chronic <b>auditory</b> <b>trauma</b> were excluded; the possible correlations with some biochemical parameters (urea, creatinine, PTH) were also looked for. Results. Hearing loss was present in 77 % of patients and 69. 2 % of ears; the percentage of patients with hypoacusia was higher in group III (84 %) than in group I (76. 3 %) and II (71. 7 %), but the differences were not statistically significant. Hypoacusia was coch-lear neurosensory in 61. 5 %, conductive in 6. 5 %, and mixed in 9. 0 % of patients; the percentage of patients with cochlear neurosensory hypoacousia was similar in the three groups (I, 61. 7 %; II, 59. 3 %; III, 64 %). Hearing loss was of slight to moderate degree and not different in the three groups (I, 22. 7 + 15 dB; II, 26. 9 + 6. 0 dB; III, 29. 1 ± 8. 9 dB). There were no correlations between hearing loss and plasma creatinine and PTH values; patients with plasma urea> 200 mg/dl had higher percentage of hypoacousia (86 %) than patients with plasma urea = 0. 06). Conclusions. Hearing loss, mainly cochlear neuro-sensory in type, is present in a high percentage of patients on RDT even at the beginning of treatment, but no negative effects on hearing can be correlated with the duration of dialysis.
