The course of this demographic transition is evaluated based on the analysis of fertility and mortality. Another aim is to evaluate the possible use of the <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend</b> that may occur in these countries. This is mainly to evaluate the key factors which affect the <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend.</b> First, we analyze {{the development of the}} age structure which is crucial for defining the beginning and the length of the period of the <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend.</b> Then comes the analysis of other factors such as health, education and employment of the population. These factors determine whether a country is able to effectively exploit the potential of the <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend.</b> It is obvious that not only the favorable age structure but also properly directed government policy is necessary for the period of <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend.</b> In conclusion we summarize the findings of analysis by which we determine at which stages of demographic transition Iran and Iraq are located. In addition, we approximately define the period of the <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend</b> in these two [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Background : The {{demographic}} transition experienced by developed countries produces initial {{positive effects on}} economic growth ‒ the first <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend</b> ‒ which can be extended into a second <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend</b> if baby boomers' savings increase capital accumulation. Nevertheless, aging might reverse this process if dissaving of elderly baby boomers and {{the pressure on the}} pay-as-you-go financed welfare state reduce savings and capital. Objective : The aim {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the extent to which <b>demographic</b> <b>dividends</b> in Spain provide an opportunity for the reform of the welfare state system for an aging population. Methods : We decompose <b>demographic</b> <b>dividends</b> using a general equilibrium overlapping generations model with realistic demography and public transfers from the National Transfer Accounts database. This allows us to capture the endogenous evolution of savings and capital accumulation and, hence, the second <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend.</b> Results : When baby boomers enter the labor market, the purely demographic support ratio increases and this positive effect is extended by composition changes in the age structure of workers. When they start saving, the second <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend</b> arises, while its total net effect depends both on the strength of the aging process and on transfer size. Conclusions : The derived decomposition shows that the second <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend</b> might also disappear. Sharp population aging in Spain implies that capital will shrink drastically after 2040. Before this, there seems to be margin for reforms; however, an extension of the welfare state toward the Nordic model would considerably reduce capital. Contribution : This paper contributes to the debate on the effects of demographics on economic growth by decomposing <b>demographic</b> <b>dividends</b> and investigating the impact of different welfare state transfer systems on the second <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{disagreements}} on changed {{stages of}} demographic transition {{and the role}} of a <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend</b> in a dual economy development process often lead to wide debates among scholars about China’s development stages. This paper tries to reveal the nexus between demographic transition and dual economy development: the common starting point, close related processes, and identical characteristics of stages. Based on the empirical evidence of population dynamics, the paper supports the judgment of diminishing <b>demographic</b> <b>dividends</b> and an imminent Lewis turning point in China. It also argues that further economic growth and thus faster entry into a high-income economy is the key and only way to close the “aging before affluence ” gap. Accordingly, the paper concludes by proposing measures to exploit the potential of the first <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend,</b> creating conditions for a second <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend,</b> and tapping new sources of economic growth...|$|R

30|$|The {{literature}} has frequently used convergence models {{to show the}} role of demographic change on economic growth. However, {{the results of these}} econometric models usually suffer from endogeneity problems (Feyrer 2007). More importantly, {{it is not possible to}} extend this kind of analysis further in the past because of the lack of data. A new approach to answer this old question is to estimate the <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend</b> using overlapping generation models (OLG) since the accumulation of capital and labor are modeled endogenously. For instance, Sánchez-Romero (2013) followed this strategy to analyze the evolution of the <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend</b> in Taiwan.

Our results confirm the role of population age structure in the <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend,</b> but also reveal that education attainment can be even more crucial. Moreover, we find that the way how both age and education effects finally impact on economic growth depends to a great extent on the specific consumption and labor income age profiles in each country...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{of the factors that}} contributed to economic growth in China in the past three decades. Abstract With the reduction of the working-age population and the increase of the population dependency ratio as the main characteristics of the <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend</b> having disappeared, China’s potential growth rate decreases. And our results suggest that <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend</b> contributed to nearly one forth of the economic growth in China in the past three decades, while TFP growth explains another one third with the remainder mainly due to capital accumulation, explaining nearly half. China’s potential growth rate will slow down—from nearly 10 per cent in the past 30 years to 7. 5 per cent on average during 2011 - 2015 —due to the diminished <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend,</b> but reform measures are conductive to clearing the institutional barriers to the supply of factors and productivity, thereby slowing the declining trend of potential growth rate.

One of the principal findings of this paper is that an effective use of the <b>demographic</b> <b>dividends,</b> particularly the accumulated second <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend</b> which is likely to remain substantial for the next few decades, appears to be an attractive policy option for Japan to place its future economic growth on a steady path. Another important finding derived from this study is that, since the bursting of the bubble economy in the early 1990 s, Japanese elderly persons have been informally playing the role of the society's safety net in providing financial assistance to their adult children and/or grandchildren through the traditional familial transfer mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{demographic}} transition {{has increased the}} share of the working-age population in Middle East and North Africa (MENA).

40|$|For {{more about}} the East-West Center, see [URL] <b>Demographic</b> <b>dividends</b> are {{economic}} benefits that arise from changes in population age structure and from other demographic forces, enhancing opportunities for economic development. As falling fertility results in fewer dependent children relative to workers, a country experiences a first <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend,</b> with resources becoming available to increase investments and raise standards of living. The economic boost can be substantial, but it eventually {{comes to an end}} as the smaller population of children grows up to become a smaller population of workers while the number of elderly keeps growing. Depending on the choices made by families and the policies pursued by governments, however, the first dividend can direct more resources into pro-growth investment, resulting in a second, more long-lasting, <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend.</b> National Transfer Accounts (NTA) analysis {{over the past few years}} points to two important channels through which this occurs. For one thing, changing demography can lead to higher rates of saving and investment. A working-age population facing a long period of retirement has a powerful incentive to accumulate assets. The second channel is through human-capital investment. Countries with low fertility invest more in the education and health of each child, and the improved skills and capabilities of each worker can more than compensate for the slower growth of the work force. For the many countries currently experiencing a first <b>demographic</b> <b>dividend,</b> NTA can help understand how the benefits can be accelerated, prolonged, and directed toward important development goals. Other countries, which have completed the first dividend, can use NTA to understand how economic benefits can be sustained and how governments and families can best prepare for population aging...|$|R
