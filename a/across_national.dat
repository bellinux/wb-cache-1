25|$|Importing {{books and}} texts <b>across</b> <b>national</b> borders can {{sometimes}} be subject to more stringent laws than in the nations concerned. Customs officers are often permitted to seize even merely 'indecent' works that would be perfectly legal to sell and possess once one is inside the nations concerned. Canada has been particularly notorious for such border seizures.|$|E

Furthermore, the government of Ethiopia is purportedly unhappy with lost tax revenue and foreign exchange revenues. Recent initiatives have sought to document and regulate this trade.|$|E

25|$|Families do {{not always}} immigrate as one unit. Given the various legal and {{economical}} factors associated with transnational migration, certain family members may {{find it easier to}} immigrate to the United States than others. In other cases, individuals may immigrate to the United States as an employment strategy, with no intention of permanently relocating their family to the U.S. The distribution of family members <b>across</b> <b>national</b> borders can generate unique forms of inequality within the families of immigrants.|$|E
25|$|Trains in the City Tunnel will be {{controlled}} by the new ERTMS signalling system, a new European standard simplifying operations <b>across</b> <b>national</b> borders. Due to delays in equipment installation for integration between ERTMS and the older Swedish and (especially) Danish systems, there is a temporary arrangement using ATC. In 2012 (tentatively), when all trains using the City Tunnel are retrofitted, ATC will be removed and ERTMS deployed. Since ERTMS is already installed and tested, the changeover can be done overnight.|$|E

30|$|As in many {{advanced}} countries, {{activity and}} employment rates for immigrant women in Italy display great variability <b>across</b> <b>nationals</b> groups. Some nationalities (NENAC, Central Asia), in particular, are characterised by extremely low {{participation in the}} labor market. This fact can be due to either a supply “cultural” or a demand “skill” effect. The aim {{of this paper is}} to disentangle these two components by estimating the economic value of the time spent at home (reservation wages).|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were: i) to establish the status of woody vegetation structure and composition, and ii) to determine the main factors influencing woody vegetation structure and composition <b>across</b> Gonarezhou <b>National</b> Park, Zimbabwe. We divided the park into three large strata based on natural and artificial features. A total of 137 sample plots were randomly placed to gather data on woody vegetation in the three study strata <b>across</b> Gonarezhou <b>National</b> Park from May to June 2011. Trees constituted 66 % and shrubs 34 % of the woody plants sampled. A total of 132 woody plant species were recorded. Significant {{differences were found in}} basal area, shrub density, browsed plants density and woody species diversity <b>across</b> Gonarezhou <b>National</b> Park. In contrast, no significant differences were recorded in tree height, densities of trees, stems, dead plants and fire damaged plants. Our results suggest that there are some variations in woody vegetation structure and composition <b>across</b> Gonarezhou <b>National</b> Park. These variations could be attributed to both natural and anthropogenic disturbance factors including elephant (Loxodonta africana Blumenbach) browsing, fires, droughts and previous tsetse fly (Glossina spp.) (Diptera: Glossinidae) eradication activities in the park...|$|R
25|$|The {{identification}} of strata by the fossils they contained, pioneered by William Smith, Georges Cuvier, Jean d'Omalius d'Halloy, and Alexandre Brogniart {{in the early}} 19th century, enabled geologists to divide Earth history more precisely. It also enabled them to correlate strata <b>across</b> <b>national</b> (or even continental) boundaries. If two strata (however distant in space or different in composition) contained the same fossils, chances were good {{that they had been}} laid down at the same time. Detailed studies between 1820 and 1850 of the strata and fossils of Europe produced the sequence of geological periods still used today.|$|E
25|$|Migration {{is often}} used as an {{employment}} strategy. Although many individuals choose to migrate permanently to another country, others may migrate on a more temporary basis or do so seasonally. When families do not all migrate together, they must negotiate family relationships <b>across</b> <b>national</b> borders. Which family members migrate and which stay behind can be important determinants of how inequality may manifest itself in these transnational families. Among families from Latin American countries, it {{is often the case}} that men will travel abroad to work. This means that the women in these families do the bulk of the day-to-day caring for the family.|$|E
25|$|In most countries, a bachelor's {{degree in}} {{engineering}} represents {{the first step}} towards professional certification, and a professional body certifies the degree program. After completing a certified degree program, the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements (including work experience and exam requirements) before being certified. Once certified, the engineer is designated as a professional engineer (in the United States, Canada and South Africa), a chartered engineer (in most Commonwealth countries), a chartered professional engineer (in Australia and New Zealand), or a European engineer (in most countries of the European Union). There are international agreements between relevant professional bodies to allow engineers to practice <b>across</b> <b>national</b> borders.|$|E

25|$|The International Bank Account Number (IBAN) is {{an internationally}} agreed system of {{identifying}} bank accounts <b>across</b> <b>national</b> borders {{to facilitate the}} communication and processing of cross border transactions with a reduced risk of transcription errors. It was originally adopted by the European Committee for Banking Standards (ECBS), and later as an international standard under ISO 13616:1997. The current standard is ISO 13616:2007, which indicates SWIFT as the formal registrar. Initially developed to facilitate payments within the European Union, it has been implemented by most European countries and numerous countries in {{the other parts of}} the world, mainly in the Middle East and in the Caribbean. As of February 2016, 69 countries were using the IBAN numbering system.|$|E
25|$|Over 95% of {{cross-border}} trade {{within the region}} is unofficial and undocumented, carried out by pastoralists trading livestock. The unofficial trade of live cattle, camels, sheep and goats from Ethiopia sold to {{other countries in the}} Horn and the wider Eastern Africa region, including Somalia and Djibouti, generates an estimated total value of between US$250 and US$300 million annually (100 times more than the official figure). This trade helps lower food prices, increase food security, relieve border tensions and promote regional integration. However, there are also risks as the unregulated and undocumented nature of this trade runs risks, such as allow disease to spread more easily <b>across</b> <b>national</b> borders. Furthermore, governments are unhappy with lost tax revenue and foreign exchange revenues.|$|E
25|$|The {{interest}} in the sociology of law continues to be more widespread in Western countries. Some important research has been produced by Indian scholars, but we find only {{a limited amount of}} socio-legal work by researchers from, for example, the Middle East or central and northern parts of Africa. Thus, the global spread of sociological studies of law appears uneven and concentrated, above all, in industrialised nations with democratic political systems. In this sense, the global expansion of legal sociology “is not taking place uniformly <b>across</b> <b>national</b> boundaries and appears to correlate with a combination of factors such as national wealth/poverty and form of political organisation, as well as historical factors such as the growth of the welfare state... However, none of these factors alone can explain this disparity”.|$|E
