25|$|Umar I {{had ordered}} that nobody should <b>adulterate</b> milk by mixing water into it. Once, while patrolling about {{at night to}} inquire into the {{condition}} of people, he heard a woman asker her daughter to mix water into the milk before the day-break. The girl refused by reminding her mother of the order given by the Caliph. When the mother retorted {{by saying that the}} Caliph was not present and he would not know of it, the daughter replied that God is Omniscient even if Caliph was not present. Umar I was so pleased with the reply that he asked his son Asim to marry the girl, saying that he hoped that she will give birth to a man who would rule over Arabia. Umar II was the son of Asim's daughter from this marriage (Abdul Hakam, pp 17-18).|$|E

500|$|Shearer {{provides}} voices for Principal Skinner, Kent Brockman, Mr. Burns, Waylon Smithers, Ned Flanders, Reverend Lovejoy, Dr. Hibbert, Lenny Leonard, Otto Mann, Rainier Wolfcastle, Scratchy, Kang, Dr. Marvin Monroe, Judge Snyder {{and many}} others. He has described {{all of his}} regular characters' voices as [...] "easy to slip into. [...] I wouldn't do them if they weren't easy." [...] Shearer modeled Mr. Burns's voice on the two actors Lionel Barrymore and Ronald Reagan. Shearer says that Burns {{is the most difficult}} character for him to voice because it is rough on his vocal cords and he often needs to drink tea and honey to soothe his voice. He describes Burns as his favorite character, saying he [...] "like Mr. Burns because he is pure evil. A lot of evil people make the mistake of diluting it. Never <b>adulterate</b> your evil." [...] Shearer is also the voice of Burns' assistant Smithers, and is able to perform dialogue between the two characters in one take. In the episode [...] "Bart's Inner Child", Harry Shearer said [...] "wow" [...] in the voice of Otto, which was then used when Otto was seen jumping on a trampoline. Ned Flanders had been meant to be just a neighbor that Homer was jealous of, but because Shearer used [...] "such a sweet voice" [...] for him, Flanders was broadened to become a Christian and a sweet guy that someone would prefer to live next to over Homer. Dr. Marvin Monroe's voice was based on psychiatrist David Viscott. Monroe has been retired since the seventh season because voicing the character strained Shearer's throat.|$|E

50|$|The {{fact that}} a food is {{contaminated}} with pathogens (harmful microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, or protozoa) may, or may not, render it <b>adulterated.</b> Generally, for ready-to-eat foods, the presence of pathogens will render the food <b>adulterated.</b> For example, the presence of Salmonella on fresh fruits or vegetables or in ready-to-eat meat or poultry products (such as luncheon meats) will render those products <b>adulterated.</b>|$|R

2500|$|An early 20th century {{industry}} manual {{states that}} while the opium poppy was grown extensively in Eurasia, {{most of the world}} production of poppyseed oil occurred in France and Germany, from poppy seeds imported from other countries. [...] From 1900 to 1911, France and Germany together produced on the order of 60,000,000 kilograms per year. [...] At that time, poppyseed oil was used primarily to dress salads and frequently was adulterated with sesame oil and hazelnut oil to improve the taste of oil from stored (rancid) seeds. [...] Poppyseed oil was used to <b>adulterate</b> olive oil and peach kernel oil. [...] Poor quality poppyseed oil was valuable in the soap industry.|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Burns was {{originally}} voiced by actor Christopher Collins in the episodes [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire", [...] "Homer's Odyssey", There's No Disgrace Like Home and [...] "The Telltale Head". He was soon replaced by Harry Shearer because Sam Simon found him [...] "difficult to work with". Shearer has voiced the character ever since. He modeled {{the voice on}} Lionel Barrymore and Ronald Reagan. Shearer is also the voice of Smithers {{and is able to}} perform dialogue between the two characters in one take. Shearer said that Mr. Burns is the most difficult character for him to voice because it is rough on his vocal cords and he often needs to drink tea and honey to soothe his voice.

50|$|Generally, if a food {{contains}} a poisonous or deleterious substance that may render it injurious to health, {{it is considered}} to be <b>adulterated.</b> For example, apple cider contaminated with E. coli O157:H7 and Brie cheese contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes are <b>adulterated.</b> There are two exceptions to this general rule. First, if the poisonous substance is inherent or naturally occurring and its quantity in the food does not ordinarily render it injurious to health, the food will not be considered <b>adulterated.</b> Thus, a food that {{contains a}} natural toxin at very low levels that would not ordinarily be harmful (for instance, small amounts of amygdalin in apricot kernels) is not <b>adulterated.</b>|$|R
40|$|Honey is a sweet {{substance}} {{that can be}} <b>adulterated</b> easily with inexpensive sweeteners by making syrup. Water being the second major constituent of honey, makes its flow behavior {{one of the important}} parameter for quality determination. In the present study, the rheological characteristics of honey samples <b>adulterated</b> with different concentrations of jaggery syrup were studied using rotational rheometer with parallel plate geometry. The viscosity of honey and <b>adulterated</b> honey samples was determined by varying temperature and percentage of jaggery concentration. All the <b>adulterated</b> honey samples behaved as non-Newtonian fluid. The viscosity increased linearly with increase in concentration of adulteration and varied from 2. 48 – 4. 80 Pa s as adulteration increased from 5 to 30...|$|R
40|$|A {{fiber optic}} {{displacement}} sensor (FODS) using a transmission technique {{was developed to}} detect sugar contents in honey. This was achieved by measuring the output signal of non- and <b>adulterated</b> honey with different addition percentage volumes of sugar (fructose and glucose). Five types of honey samples were <b>adulterated</b> with different percentages of fructose and glucose ranging from 0 % to 10 %. Blue diode laser at 435 nm {{was used as a}} light source in this FODS. The performance of sensor showed that the voltage signal linearly increased with the concentration of adulteration of sugar. In contrast, the refractive index of the <b>adulterated</b> honey is found decreasing with the concentration of sugar. This means the higher sugar contents in <b>adulterated</b> honey the lower is the refractive index leading to high transmission in FODS. Thus, FODS based on a transmission technique has a potential to detect the sugar content in <b>adulterated</b> honey. The simplicity, faster, and cost effective made FODS as a promising technique for food industry...|$|R
2500|$|Other {{than being}} grown for their beauty, {{species such as}} P.graveolens are {{important}} in the perfume industry and are cultivated and distilled for their scents. Although scented pelargoniums exist which have smells of citrus, mint, pine, spices or various fruits, the varieties with rose scents are most commercially important. Pelargonium distillates and absolutes, commonly known as [...] "scented geranium oil" [...] are sometimes used to supplement or <b>adulterate</b> expensive rose oils. The oils of the scented pelargoniums contain citronellol, geraniol, eugenol, alpha pinene and many other compounds. The edible leaves and flowers are also used as a flavouring in desserts, cakes, jellies and teas. Scented-leafed pelargoniums {{can be used to}} flavor jellies, cakes, butters, ice cream, iced tea and other dishes, The rose-, lemon- and peppermint-scents are most commonly used. Also used are those with hints of peach, cinnamon and orange. Commonly used lemon-scented culinary species include P.crispum and P.citronellum. Rose-scenteds include P.graveolens and members of the P.graveolens cultivar group. Other species and cultivars with culinary use include the lime-scented P.‘Lime’, the lemon balm-scented P.‘Lemon Balm’, the strawberry-lemon-scented P.‘Lady Scarborough’ and the peppermint-scented P.tomentosum.|$|E

You know what horseradish is--grows like wildfire--spreads--spreads. I stood at the end of the platform looking at the stuff and thinking about it. 'Like fame,' I thought, 'rank and wild where it isn't wanted. Why don't the really good things in life grow like horseradish?' I thought. My mind went off in a peculiar way it does from that to the idea that mustard costs a penny a tin--I bought some the other day for a ham I had. It came into my head that it would be ripping good business to use horseradish to <b>adulterate</b> mustard.

50|$|For {{meat and}} poultry products, which are {{regulated}} by USDA, the rules are more complicated.

For raw meat or poultry products, the presence of pathogens will not always render a product <b>adulterated</b> (because raw meat and poultry products are intended to be cooked, and proper cooking should kill pathogens). Raw poultry contaminated with Salmonella is not <b>adulterated.</b> However, USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has ruled that raw meat or poultry products contaminated with E. coli O157:H7 are <b>adulterated.</b> This is because normal cooking methods may not reduce E. coli O157:H7 below infectious levels.

Enforcement action is usually preceded by a Warning Letter from FDA to the manufacturer or distributor of the <b>adulterated</b> product. In the case of an <b>adulterated</b> meat or poultry product, FSIS has certain additional powers. FSIS may suspend or withdraw federal inspection of an official establishment. Without federal inspection, an establishment may not produce or process meat or poultry products, and therefore must cease operations.
