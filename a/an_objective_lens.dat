25|$|Since {{crafting}} large lenses is {{much more}} difficult than crafting large mirrors, most modern telescopes are reflecting telescopes, that is, telescopes that use a primary mirror rather than <b>an</b> <b>objective</b> <b>lens.</b> The same general optical considerations apply to reflecting telescopes that applied to refracting telescopes, namely, the larger the primary mirror, the more light collected, and the magnification is still equal to the focal length of the primary mirror divided by the focal length of the eyepiece. Professional telescopes generally do not have eyepieces and instead place an instrument (often a charge-coupled device) at the focal point instead.|$|E
25|$|Image intensifiers convert {{low levels}} of light photons into {{electrons}}, amplify those electrons, and then convert the electrons back into photons of light. Photons from a low-light source enter <b>an</b> <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> which focuses an image into a photocathode. The photocathode releases electrons via the photoelectric effect as the incoming photons hit it. The electrons are accelerated through a high-voltage potential into a microchannel plate (MCP). Each high-energy electron that strikes the MCP causes the release of many electrons from the MCP in a process called secondary cascaded emission. The MCP is tilted to encourage more electron collisions, thus {{increasing the amount of}} emission of secondary electrons.|$|E
25|$|Microscopes {{were first}} {{developed}} {{with just two}} lenses: <b>an</b> <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> and an eyepiece. The objective lens is essentially a magnifying glass and was designed with a very small focal length while the eyepiece generally has a longer focal length. This {{has the effect of}} producing magnified images of close objects. Generally, an additional source of illumination is used since magnified images are dimmer due to the conservation of energy and the spreading of light rays over a larger surface area. Modern microscopes, known as compound microscopes have many lenses in them (typically four) to optimize the functionality and enhance image stability. A slightly different variety of microscope, the comparison microscope, looks at side-by-side images to produce a stereoscopic binocular view that appears three dimensional when used by humans.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the use of}} an epifluorescent microscope, {{microscopic}} flows can be analyzed. [...] MicroPIV {{makes use}} of fluorescing particles that excite at a specific wavelength and emit at another wavelength. [...] Laser light is reflected through a dichroic mirror, travels through <b>an</b> <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> that focuses on the point of interest, and illuminates a regional volume. [...] The emission from the particles, along with reflected laser light, shines back through the objective, the dichroic mirror and through an emission filter that blocks the laser light. [...] Where PIV draws its 2-dimensional analysis properties from the planar nature of the laser sheet, microPIV utilizes the ability of the objective lens to focus on only one plane at a time, thus creating a 2-dimensional plane of viewable particles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{examples of}} compound microscopes, which combine <b>an</b> <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> near the specimen with an eyepiece {{to view a}} real image, appeared in Europe around 1620. The design {{is very similar to}} the telescope and, like that device, its inventor is unknown. Again claims revolve around the spectacle making centers in the Netherlands including claims it was invented in 1590 by Zacharias Janssen and/or his father, Hans Martens, claims it was invented by rival spectacle maker, Hans Lippershey, and claims it was invented by expatriate Cornelis Drebbel who was noted to have a version in London in 1619. Galileo Galilei (also sometimes cited as a compound microscope inventor) seems to have found after 1609 that he could close focus his telescope to view small objects and, after seeing a compound microscope built by Drebbel exhibited in Rome in 1624, built his own improved version. The name [...] "microscope" [...] was coined by Giovanni Faber, who gave that name to Galileo Galilei's compound microscope in 1625.|$|E

50|$|In single {{particle}} imaging applications, {{the number}} of photons detected from the fluorescent label {{plays a crucial role}} in the quantitative analysis of the acquired data. Currently, particle tracking experiments are typically carried out on either an inverted or an upright microscope, in which <b>a</b> single <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> illuminates the sample and also collects the fluorescence signal from it. Note that although fluorescence emission from the sample occurs in all directions (i.e., above and below the sample), the use of <b>a</b> single <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> in these microscope configurations results in collecting light from only one side of the sample. Even if a high numerical aperture <b>objective</b> <b>lens</b> is used, not all photons emitted at one side of the sample can be collected due to the finite collection angle of the <b>objective</b> <b>lens.</b> Thus even under the best imaging conditions conventional microscopes collect only a fraction of the photons emitted from the sample.|$|R
