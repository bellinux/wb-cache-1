5|$|However, known {{cases of}} the {{diffusion}} of writing, such as Sequoyah's invention of the Cherokee syllabary after seeing the power of English-language newspapers, or Uyaquk's invention of the Yugtun script inspired by readings from Christian scripture, involved greater contact than the signing of a single treaty. The glyphs could be crudely written rongorongo, <b>as</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> for Rapa Nui representatives writing with the novel instrument of pen on paper. The fact that the script was not otherwise observed by early explorers, who spent little time on the island, may reflect that it was taboo; such taboos may have lost power along with the tangata rongorongo (scribes) by the time Rapanui society collapsed following European slaving raids and the resulting epidemics, so that the tablets had become more widely distributed by Eyraud's day. Orliac points out that Tablet C would appear to predate the Spanish visit by at least a century.|$|E
5|$|Hybrids are not <b>as</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> always {{intermediate}} {{between their}} parents (as {{if there were}} blending inheritance), but are sometimes stronger than either parent variety, a phenomenon called heterosis, hybrid vigour, or heterozygote advantage. This is most common with plant hybrids. A transgressive phenotype is a phenotype that displays more extreme characteristics than either of the parent lines. Plant breeders use several techniques to produce hybrids, including line breeding {{and the formation of}} complex hybrids. An economically important example is hybrid maize (corn), which provides a considerable seed yield advantage over open pollinated varieties. Hybrid seed dominates the commercial maize seed market in the United States, Canada and many other major maize-producing countries.|$|E
5|$|Being the {{smallest}} alkali metal, lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable organometallic compounds, which are bonded covalently. Organolithium compounds are electrically non-conducting volatile solids or liquids that melt at low temperatures, {{and tend to}} form oligomers with the structure (RLi)x where R is the organic group. As the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the charge density of the bond on the carbon atom, effectively creating a carbanion, organolithium compounds are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles. For use as bases, butyllithiums are often used and are commercially available. An example of an organolithium compound is methyllithium ((CH3Li)x), which exists in tetrameric (x = 4, tetrahedral) and hexameric (x = 6, octahedral) forms. Organolithium compounds, especially n-butyllithium, are useful reagents in organic synthesis, <b>as</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> given lithium's diagonal relationship with magnesium, which {{plays an important role}} in the Grignard reaction. For example, alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may be used to synthesise aldehydes and ketones by reaction with metal carbonyls. The reaction with nickel tetracarbonyl, for example, proceeds through an unstable acyl nickel carbonyl complex which then undergoes electrophilic substitution to give the desired aldehyde (using H+ as the electrophile) or ketone (using an alkyl halide) product.|$|E

5|$|The letters {{first learned}} by a child, {{commonly}} their own name, {{may come to}} have lasting positive associations. Hoorens and Todorova tested this by looking for a name-letter effect in bilingual subjects where their mother tongue alphabet was Cyrillic and their foreign-language alphabet Roman. Because learning a foreign language at a later age does not typically involve extra attention given to name letters, {{there should be no}} name-letter effect in the foreign-language alphabet, only in the first-language alphabet. Results of a study with 100 Bulgarian subjects who at a later age learned English, German, French or Spanish revealed a name-letter effect for the Roman alphabet as well as for Cyrillic. The researchers concluded mastery pleasure is not the principle cause of the name-letter effect. In a follow-up study Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun tested the strength of the name-letter effect among elementary-school children, in a cross-sectional experimental design involving Flemish and Hungarian second, fourth, and sixth graders. Instead of finding the name-effect to decrease with age <b>as</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected,</b> they found it increased, thus proving that mastery pleasure is not the principal cause. They also investigated name-letter effects in bilingual Thai subjects, some of whom had learned the English alphabet {{at the same time as}} the Thai alphabet, and others who had learned it later. They found that the time at which students had learned the second alphabet made no difference in the strength of the name-letter effect, thereby ruling out mastery pleasure as a co-determinant.|$|E

25|$|Not all Catholics were {{in favour}} either: {{late in his}} life Cardinal Wiseman {{made it clear that}} his {{preference}} was for Renaissance art, <b>as</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> of a religious order of Italian origin.|$|E

25|$|Convulsions from GHB can {{be treated}} with the benzodiazepines {{diazepam}} or lorazepam. Even though these benzodiazepines are also CNS depressants, they are GABAA agonists whereas GHB is primarily a GABAB agonist, and so do not worsen CNS depression as much <b>as</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected.</b>|$|E
25|$|To {{become a}} practitioner, {{there was no}} one fixed method or path of training. There was even no formal {{specialization}} in the different branches of medicine, <b>as</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected.</b> But some students did eventually approximate to a specialist by acquiring proficiency in the treatment of certain diseases or in the use of certain drugs.|$|E
25|$|E. obliqua was {{published}} in 1788-89, which coincided with the first official European settlement of Australia. Between then and {{the turn of the}} 19th century, several more species of Eucalyptus were named and published. Most of these were by the English botanist James Edward Smith and most were, <b>as</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected,</b> trees of the Sydney region. These include the economically valuable E. pilularis, E. saligna and E. tereticornis.|$|E

25|$|Other notable poets {{to emerge}} in the early and middle 19th century include Ralph Waldo Emerson (18031882), Edgar Allan Poe (18091849), Henry David Thoreau (18171862), Sidney Lanier (18421881), and James Whitcomb Riley (18491916). <b>As</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected,</b> the works of all these writers are united by a common search for a {{distinctive}} American voice to distinguish them from their British counterparts. To this end, they explored the landscape and traditions of their native country as materials for their poetry.|$|E
25|$|The {{holographic}} principle {{was inspired by}} black hole thermodynamics, which conjectures that the maximal entropy in any region scales with the radius squared, and not cubed <b>as</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected.</b> In {{the case of a}} black hole, the insight was that the informational content of all the objects that have fallen into the hole might be entirely contained in surface fluctuations of the event horizon. The {{holographic principle}} resolves the black hole information paradox within the framework of string theory.|$|E
25|$|Suite française, {{so far as}} it was completed, {{was written}} in {{microscopic}} handwriting in a single notebook; Tempête and Dolce together filled 140 pages, corresponding to 516 published pages. It was possibly the earliest work of literary fiction about World War II, and is remarkable as a historical novel sequence written during the period that it depicts, transformed far beyond the level of a journal of events such <b>as</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to emerge from the turmoil and tragedy Némirovsky experienced.|$|E

25|$|The outer part of {{the double}} coat should be {{straight}} and wiry in texture, never soft, silky, curly, wavy, or woolly <b>as</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> in the Kerry Blue Terrier. The coat should lie flat against the skin, and, though having some length, should never be so long as to hide the true shape of the dog. There are longer hairs on the legs, but never {{so much as a}} Wire Fox Terrier or Schnauzer. That means {{you have to have the}} coat trimmed often which can be expensive.|$|E
25|$|The Duala {{have been}} mostly Christianized since the 1930s. Evangelical {{denominations}} dominate, particularly the Baptist church. Nevertheless, {{remnants of a}} pre-Christian ancestor worship persist. <b>As</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> for coastal peoples, the sea also {{plays an important role}} in this faith. For example, Duala belief holds that their ancestors live in the sea. In this worldview, demi-human water spirits known as Miengu (singular: Jengu) live in the waters and mediate between worshippers and God.Traditional festivals held each year serve as the most visible expression of these traditional beliefs in modern times.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there were}} supporters. Medwin's book was well {{received}} by several eminent writers, including Sir Samuel Egerton Brydges, who included in his edition of Edward Phillips' Theatrum Petarum Anglicanorum {{a memoir of}} Shelley, written by Medwin. Leigh Hunt, <b>as</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected,</b> took a more tolerant view of Medwin in Lord Byron and his Contemporaries (1828), and {{since the publication of}} Byron's letters in Thomas Moore's biography(1830/31) and Lady Blessington's Conversations(1832–33), Medwin's recollections of Byron have come to be seen, if not always faithful in detail, as an essentially accurate portrayal.|$|E
60|$|But Bernard {{was anxious}} to discuss another subject, and {{therefore}} would not speak such words of wisdom as to Lily's engagement <b>as</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>expected</b> from him had he been in a different frame of mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush," [...] said Deronda, {{under the}} pretext that the singing {{was going to}} begin. He was not so delighted with the answer <b>as</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>expected,</b> and <b>was</b> {{relieved}} by Hans's movement to a more advanced spot.|$|R
60|$|The {{names of}} the commanders who headed the {{expedition}} which first landed have been preserved, and they have acquired, <b>as</b> <b>might</b> have <b>been</b> <b>expected,</b> a very wide celebrity. They were Hengist and Horsa. Hengist and Horsa were brothers.|$|R
25|$|Pan Am's {{mechanics}} {{and support staff}} were similarly trained. Newly hired applicants were frequently paired with experienced flight mechanics in several areas of the company until they had achieved proficiency in all aircraft types. Emphasis was placed on learning to maintain and overhaul aircraft in harsh seaborne environments when faced with logistical difficulties, <b>as</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> in a small foreign port without an aviation infrastructure or even an adequate road network. Many crews supported repair operations by flying in spare parts to planes stranded overseas, in some cases performing repairs themselves.|$|E
25|$|Priuli wrote both {{sacred and}} secular music, in both {{conservative}} and progressive styles, including the Venetian polychoral style; {{he was one}} of the composers who imported it to German-speaking lands. His music includes a cappella vocal music, voices with instruments, and some purely instrumental music. From the publication dates of his collections, he seems to have composed most of his sacred music and instrumental music in the service of the Habsburgs, and likely wrote much of his secular music – particularly the Italian madrigals, <b>as</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> – while he was in Venice.|$|E
25|$|The {{universe}} is made chiefly of matter, rather than consisting of equal parts {{of matter and}} antimatter <b>as</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected.</b> It can be demonstrated that, to create an imbalance in matter and antimatter from an initial condition of balance, the Sakharov conditions must be satisfied, {{one of which is}} the existence of CP violation during the extreme conditions of the first seconds after the Big Bang. Explanations which do not involve CP violation are less plausible, since they rely {{on the assumption that the}} matter–antimatter imbalance was present at the beginning, or on other admittedly exotic assumptions.|$|E
