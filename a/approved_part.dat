40|$|In {{a review}} of the {{organisation}} of higher medical training in Britain leading to accreditation for those intending to specialize in venereology within the National Health Service suggestions are made for improving the present system. These include the enrollment of trainees in general medicine as well as in venereology to ensure a broad general experience of medicine. The establishment of an agreed curriculum in venereology for trainees is thought desirable. Improvement in undergraduate education in venereology is necessary if recruitment of trainees to the specialty is to be increased. The diploma courses in venereology are mainly attended by foreign graduates; the numbers are likely to be reduced by the recent heavy increases in fees. Although adequate practical experience of the tropical venereal diseases cannot be provided, these courses give a good general experience of venereology as ideally practised, much of which is relevant to the conditions under which the overseas trainees will have to work on return to their own countries.

40|$|In this enquiry {{the effect}} of gender on loan sums and {{conditions}} in dutch SME finance has been researched. Detailled information from a local Rabobank was retrieved out of 3, 502 loan applications which were processed during the financial crisis (2009 - 2015). With reference to existing literature not only the level of detail of research data was distinctive, the simultaneous involvement of gender effects among applicants, loan officers and their interrelation (pairs applicant - banker) was as well. In Behavorial Finance theory information asymmetry and psychology play {{an important part in}} limited rational decision making having characteristic differences between male and female. Risk aversion, motivation and intuition could lead to limitation of gender neutrality. There is an important difference between discrimination and permitted differentiation between heterogeneous groups. A sixfold hypothesis test was performed based on OLS-regression of applicants’, bankers’ and pairs’ gender on loan sums, <b>approved</b> <b>part,</b> processing time, interest, commission and fees. For financial and non-financial covenants a Negative Binomial regression analysis was applied for the determination of gender effects in that type of loan conditions. Gender effects were controlled for various loan characteristics and distinguishing marks (identified as the 5 Cs) of financed companies. Results indicated that there were gender differences among applicants, bankers and pairs both with respect to loan and loan conditions. Female applicants obtained lower loan sums and were charged higher commission but on the contrary they were constrained less covenants than their male counterparts. Female loan officers processed their applications quicker, approved higher average loan sums, discounted more interest, but they constrained more covenants per application. Mixed gender pairs differed from pairs consisting of only males by means of less financial covenants and a lower processing time. Negatively significant moderation effects on loan sums and conditions existed caused by poorer reimbursement perspectives, smaller sized companies and applications for working capital and real estate. In many regression models activities in agriculture, horticulture and fishery affected loan conditions in a positive way. Besides the appearance of some singular effects it was argued that results were in accordance with existing literature. Female applicants were expected to apply for lower loan sums because of their motivation to keep their enterprises small and because of their cognitive dissonance when making contracts with uncertain outcome. It was not expected that controlled for company characteristics they would pay higher commissions. Female applicants were favored with respect to processing time and amount of covenants constrained, so {{there was no evidence of}} discrimination. Based on literature about gender differences in risk aversion it was forseen that female loan officers would constrain more covenants in order to monitor better the perceived higher risks. Higher loan sums, interest discounts and lower processing times could therefore only be explained as i) a result from obliqueness in the allocation of applications by sectors applying for higher loan sums, ii) bankers’ freedom in defining loan conditions caused by a lack of decision-making procedures for loan conditions and iii) an intuitively perceived lower risk than calculated by the rating model. Further it was argued that working capital can be recited on a daily basis and real estate finance is often secured by a mortgage which explains the lower numbers of covenants constrained by bankers. The research showed some forms of ceilings in dutch SME finance. There appeared some gender differences, probably caused by behavorial aspects. However, there was no proof of ‘glass’ ceilings (detrimental to females). A remark has to be made that some of the regression models used had little explanatory value and the amount of female cases was relatively small. Nevertheless a recommendation was made in order to limit differentiation. Standardising decision-making rules, linking covenant constraints and unsecured liability to tarification and reviewing the ratingsystem used for start-ups can contribute to more transparancy in dutch SME financial decision making. Additional qualitative research on these topics is recommended...|$|E

40|$|Stamping dies {{are used}} in the Sheet Metal Forming (SMF) process for {{manufacturing}} of car body parts. The lead time for design and manufacturing of a stamping die is long, and therefore costly. In the final step of the manufacturing process, manual rework is performed to reach a desired pressure distribution on the forming surfaces in order to achieve a robust process and an <b>approved</b> <b>part</b> within tolerance. The main purpose for this work is to study and further develop a Virtual Rework Method that alters the shape of the forming surfaces of a die to compensate for the displacements of a stamping press that occur during stamping. Measurements were performed to obtain the displacements that occur in the stamping press during stamping. These measurements were performed on a double action deep drawing press of the brand Danly, located at Volvo Cars Tool & Die department in Olofström, Sweden. The measurement yields information of how the stamping press is deflecting and deforming during operation. The measurements are recorded with a Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system that records the displacements of the press during stamping. The displacements obtained in the measurements are then used as constraints to inverse FE- model a press table with topology optimization. This optimized press table is used in the Virtual Rework Method to be able to simulate both the deformations of the press and the internal deformations that occur in the die. Pre-simulations were performed before the measurements to ensure that the blank holder plate used in the measurements would withstand the applied blank holder force. These simulations also yield if the displacements were large enough for the ARAMIS DIC system to capture. The FE-model used in this work consisted of a die, blank holder, blank holder plate, outer ram and the optimized press table. The Virtual Rework Method was applied on the FE-model, where the result concludes that the altered shape of the deformed forming surfaces is almost identical to the shape of the nominal forming surfaces. However, an inversed modelled structure that represents the behavior of the outer ram is required to apply the Virtual Rework Method on the blank holder. This inversed modelled structure could be created from the displacements obtained in the measurements. To apply the Virtual Rework method on the punch, further measurements are required, where the position of the ARAMIS DIC system is altered, or an additional ARAMIS DIC system is used.  Pressverktyg används i plåtformningsprocessen vid tillverkning av karossdelar.
