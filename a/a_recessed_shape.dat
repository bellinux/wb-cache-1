40|$|One or more {{embodiments}} {{of techniques}} or systems for <b>shaped</b> <b>recess</b> flow control are provided herein. <b>A</b> <b>shaped</b> <b>recess</b> or cavity can be formed on a surface associated with fluid flow. The <b>shaped</b> <b>recess</b> can be configured to create or induce fluid effects, temperature effects, or shedding effects that interact {{with a free}} stream or other structures. The <b>shaped</b> <b>recess</b> can be formed {{at an angle to}} a free stream flow and may be substantially "V" <b>shaped.</b> The <b>shaped</b> <b>recess</b> can be coupled with a cooling channel, for example. The <b>shaped</b> <b>recess</b> can be upstream or downstream from a cooling channel and aligned in a variety of manners. Due to the fluid effects, shedding effects, and temperature effects created by <b>a</b> <b>shaped</b> <b>recess,</b> lift-off or separation of cooling jets of cooling channels can be mitigated, thereby enhancing film cooling effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{have studied}} the in situ HCl etching of Si active areas on {{patterned}} wafers. After some in situ HCl etching at 20  Torr of Si(1   0   0), we have locally obtained 2  μm long areas with misorientation angles around 4. 5 ° towards (1   1   0). Furthermore, we have evidenced <b>a</b> <b>recess</b> <b>shape</b> transition from convex (T  ≤  865  °C) to concave (T  ≥  895  °C) as the etch temperature increases, with a nearly flat surface with no facets at T  =  880  °C. The morphology of the etched structures at a given time, temperature and P HCl / P H 2 ratio will {{be a function of}} the slope lengths and the pattern dimensions. Different kinds of surfaces (rounded areas, facets) were obtained in 3. 5  μm ×  3. 5  μm Si windows after HCl etching at 850  °C during 300  s, depending on the stress within. Thermal oxidations can indeed be used to increase by 65  MPa up to 110  MPa the compressive stress in those Si windows which are bordered by SiO 2 shallow trench isolation. An increase of the misorientation angle from 4. 5 ° up to 6 ° occurred after the above-mentioned HCl etch when switching from conventional to highly strained Si windows. For the shortest etching times studied here (150  s), a selective etching of 3. 5  μm ×  3. 5  μm Si windows edges is responsible for the misorientation. The etch is then more uniform. Stress gradients might consequently be one of the main misorientation causes. We have also probed the influence of the shallow trench isolation (STI) thickness on the misorientation. A morphological difference before HCl etching {{has been shown to be}} responsible for the transition from sloped to rounded areas. A local loading effect may prevail in this case...|$|R
5000|$|Sir Richard {{was also}} buried in Exeter Cathedral, near his brother the bishop, against the north wall across the north {{ambulatory}} from the bishop's tomb. His tomb {{is marked by}} an elaborate monument comprising <b>a</b> <b>recessed</b> ogee <b>shaped</b> niche set into the wall, containing his recumbent effigy, {{in the form of}} a cross-legged knight, which style supposedly represents crusaders. At the effigy's head stands a small statue of a man and at the feet a horse with an even smaller statue of a man holding its reins. According to Prince (d. 1723) this last group refers to the tradition of the cripple who seised the foreleg of Sir Richard's horse at Cripplegate and thereby threw him off his horse into the hands of the murderous mob. It is however more likely that the figures are [...] "a touching early fourteenth century visual representation of the Knight with his immediate following ... a knight is shown accompanied by his squire, page and horse". The Devon historian Sir William Pole (d. 1635) stated that the arms of Stapledon (Argent, two bends wavy sable) were displayed on the shield of the effigy, but today no trace of colour remains. These arms are however still visible (possibly restored) on the nearby monument to his brother the bishop.|$|R
25|$|The Krag–Petersson repeating rifle has {{a falling}} block action, i.e. the {{breechblock}} moves downwards as the mechanism is opened, actuated (operated) by {{the operation of}} the exterior hammer. The tubular magazine, containing a total of 10 rounds of ammunition, was placed under the barrel. Once the mechanism was open, an extractor ejected the spent cartridge. A fresh round of ammunition was pushed into <b>a</b> <b>shaped</b> <b>recess</b> on top of the falling block by the spring in the magazine, whereupon the falling block rose slightly. The round could then be pushed into the chamber by the shooter, and the breechblock would rise completely. This rising of the breechblock (by means of a powerful spring) could catch the shooter off guard, resulting in pinched skin on the thumb.|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we propose a new method for {{reducing}} Newtonian noise (NN) in laser-interferometric gravitational wave detectors located on the Earthʼs surface. We show that by excavating meter-scale recesses in the ground around the main test masses of a gravitational wave detector {{it is possible to}} reduce the coupling of Rayleigh wave driven seismic disturbances to test mass displacement. A discussion of the optimal <b>recess</b> <b>shape</b> is given and we use finite element simulations to derive the scaling of the NN suppression with the parameters of the recess as well as the frequency of the seismic excitation. Considering an interferometer similar to an Advance LIGO configuration, our simulations indicate a frequency dependent NN suppression factor of 2 – 4 in the relevant frequency range for <b>a</b> <b>recesses</b> of 4 m depth and a width and length of 11 m and 5 m, respectively. Though a retrofit to existing interferometers seems not impossible, the application of our concept to future infrastructures seems to provide a better benefit/cost ratio and therefore a higher feasibility...|$|R

40|$|An {{apparatus}} for coating {{electrically conductive}} components, or other materials, comprises an electrically conductive component holder in an evacuated chamber supplied with evaporated solid reaction products in a carrier gas, a constant DC field being applied by connecting the holder and component as cathode, and the chamber inner wall as the anode, {{so that a}} surface plasma forms as a glow discharge border on the component surface. Specifically, the energy input into the component (9) is reduced by continuously repeating component removal {{and then return to}} holder surface, interrupting current flow by briefly breaking the mechanical contact, the duration of which does not exceed the lifetime of the excited particles in the glow discharge. USE - For e. g. coating heavy duty components with wear-protective materials, or for coating components with radioactivity absorbent materials by plasma-assisted chemical vapour deposition (CVD). ADVANTAGE - Minimises heating of component during coatin g, thus allowing coating of e. g. heat sensitive steels; avoids expensive pulse generators, allows simultaneous coating of several components, and produces thick uniform coating on all component surfaces including those with <b>a</b> complicated <b>shape,</b> <b>recesses</b> etc...|$|R

5000|$|In {{parliamentary}} procedure, <b>a</b> <b>recess</b> {{refers to}} <b>a</b> short intermission {{in a meeting}} of a deliberative assembly.
