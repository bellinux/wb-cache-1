His next project was the {{critically}} acclaimed film Terms of Endearment, which he produced, directed and wrote, winning an Academy Award for all three roles. Basing his next film, Broadcast News, on his journalistic experiences, the film earned him a further two Academy Award nominations. Although his 1994 work I'll Do Anything was hampered by negative press attention due to the cutting of all of its recorded musical numbers, <b>As</b> <b>Good</b> <b>as</b> <b>It</b> <b>Gets</b> (co-written with Mark Andrus) earned further praise. It was seven years until his next film, 2004's Spanglish. His sixth film, How Do You Know, was released in 2010. Brooks also produced and mentored Cameron Crowe on Say Anything... (1989) and Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson on Bottle Rocket (1996).|$|E

Andrus' script [...] "needed you to suspend disbelief" [...] but Brooks realised [...] "my style when directing is that I really don't {{know how to get}} people to suspend disbelief." [...] Brooks spent a year reworking the screenplay: [...] "There were changes made and the emphasis was changed but it's the product, really, of a very unusual writing team," [...] and the project became <b>As</b> <b>Good</b> <b>as</b> <b>It</b> <b>Gets,</b> taking a year to produce after funding had been secured.

[...] In the post-race press conference, the third-place finisher, Gilliland, said, [...] "It's a credit to NASCAR and their new rules, {{trying to get the}} (cars) closer, to let teams like us have a chance to be competitive. A lot of the rules (are) making these races more competitive." [...] Jeff Gordon also commented about Bayne, [...] "I think it's very cool. Trevor's a good kid, and I love the Wood Brothers.

500|$|... "Today Is Your Day" [...] is a {{song with}} a length of 3 minutes and 12 seconds. The song is a slow mid-tempo ballad of the country pop genre. Nonetheless, several critics, such as Nicholas Köhler and Ken MacQueen Maclean's, have {{described}} the track to {{be a piece of}} pop music, rather than country music. It commences with a sole piano accompanying Twain's voice, and later progresses to an assortment of banjo, string instruments and other instrumentation. However, the production is maintained as sparse, leaving Twain's vocals at center. The lyrics are written in second person and discuss optimism and personal upliftment. In the bridge she sings, [...] "Brush yourself off no regrets / This is <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> / Don’t expect more or less / Just go out and give it your best", meaning one must be able to disregard dreaming for a better day because [...] "today is all you’ve got".

500|$|Mega Man 6 {{has enjoyed}} a {{favorable}} reception from gaming publications and websites. The graphics, play control, challenge level, and added power-ups were generally praised. GamePro was impressed {{with some of the}} newer enemies and larger mid-stage bosses, but was displeased with the game's recycling of Master Weapons seen in previous Mega Man games. Overall, the magazine described the graphics, audio, and level design in Mega Man 6 as standard fare for the franchise and called the game a [...] "rock of reliable NES fun" [...] in a series that is as [...] "predictable as the tide". Destructoid editor Tony Ponce considered Mega Man 6 the best game in the entire series. He argued that the game [...] "was retro before retro was cool" [...] due to Capcom's decision to develop it as a higher profile game on the NES during the era of fourth generation consoles. He also expressed appreciation for its music, introductions for each Robot Master, and the use of branching pathways in each level, among many other reasons. Nintendo Power listed Mega Man 6 as the best NES game of 1993, stating, [...] "His sixth NES adventure, in which he uses two new, Special Power-Ups, might just be his best". Craig Skistimas of ScrewAttack also appreciated these innovations and regretted missing out on the game when it was first released. Mega Man 6 is listed by IGN as the 58th best game on the NES. The writers summarized, [...] "Mega Man 6 is {{considered by many to be}} the last worthwhile NES release in the catalog, and though that's not saying much when looking at the title's contemporaries, Mega Man 6 is still <b>as</b> <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> in many respects." ...|$|E
