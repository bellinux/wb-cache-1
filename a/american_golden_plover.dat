500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, Kentish plover, crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, <b>American</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plover,</b> white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Moseley, {{who visited}} Bermuda in the Challenger, has well {{explained}} the probable {{origin of the}} vegetation. The large number of West Indian plants is no doubt due to the Gulf Stream and constant surface drift of warm water in this direction, while others have been brought by the annual cyclones which sweep over the intervening ocean. The great number of American migratory birds, including large flocks of the <b>American</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plover,</b> with ducks and other aquatic species, no doubt occasionally bring seeds, either in the mud attached to their feet or in their stomachs.[59] As these causes are either constantly in action or recur annually, {{it is not surprising}} that almost all the species should be unchanged owing to the frequent intercrossing of freshly-arrived specimens. If a competent botanist were thoroughly to explore Bermuda, eliminate the species introduced by human agency, and investigate the source from whence the others were derived and the mode by which they had reached so remote an island, we should obtain important information as to the dispersal of plants, which might afford us a clue to the solution of many difficult problems in their geographical distribution.|$|E

2500|$|After twenty-nine {{days out}} of sight of land, on 7 October 1492, the crew spotted [...] "mmense flocks of birds", some of which his sailors trapped and {{determined}} to be [...] "field" [...] birds (probably Eskimo curlews and <b>American</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plovers).</b> Columbus changed course to follow their flight.|$|R
40|$|The repair {{jobs that}} birds {{have to do}} to {{maintain}} high quality plumage take energy and time, so should be under intense selection. Recently, we have shown that secondary moult in the Eurasian <b>Golden</b> <b>Plover</b> Pluvialis apricaria is incomplete, irregular and asymmetric between wings, and argued that this reflected their ‘relaxed’ migratory habits. On the basis of this hypothesis, we predict that relatives of this species that have to make long flights between breeding areas and winter quarters would invest more in the moult of secondaries. To test this we collected data on moult patterns in two populations of Pacific <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> Pluvialis fulva (Siberia and Alaska), on <b>American</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> Pluvialis dominica (Alaska) and Grey Plovers Pluvialis squatarola. Data were from the breeding, staging (Mongolia and Indiana) and wintering (Uruguay) areas. We found patterns consistent with our prediction: Pacific <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> from Siberia, and Grey Plovers have a similar moulting pattern to Eurasian <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers.</b> Although both go to remote winter quarters, they migrate mainly over land, probably making short or moderate flights, as they are able to stage frequently. In contrast, the Alaskan populations of Pacific <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> and <b>American</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> tend to renew all their secondaries from their second wing moult onwards. In line with their moult patterns, these two populations are known to make very long non-stop flights between breeding and winter areas. We argue that irregular moult and the partial renewal of secondaries is a primitive character in all four species. The full replacement of secondaries in the Pacific <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> and <b>American</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> from Alaska may be considered as an adaptation for very long demanding flights. Regular moult patterns of secondaries, as found in many other shorebirds, could be a further refinement of this adaptation. ...|$|R
50|$|A {{comparison}} of dates and migratory patterns {{leads to the}} conclusion that Eskimo curlews and <b>American</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> were the most likely shore birds to have attracted the attention of Christopher Columbus to the nearby Americas in early October 1492, after 65 days at sea out of sight of land.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>American</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> (Pluvialis dominica) is a {{medium-sized}} plover. The genus name is Latin and means relating to rain, from pluvia, [...] "rain".

50|$|At least 94 {{bird species}} have been counted on Herschel Island, 40 of which breed there. The island hosts the largest colony of black guillemots in the western Arctic, nesting in the old Anglican mission house. Arctic terns, <b>American</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plovers,</b> and red-necked phalaropes {{make use of the}} tundra ponds and shingle beaches. Other birds that breed on the island include the common eider, rough-legged hawk, snow bunting, Lapland bunting, and redpoll.|$|R

40|$|<b>Golden</b> <b>plovers</b> and Grey Plovers Pluvialis spp. {{all have}} very {{distinct}} breeding plumage rich in contrast, with a conspicuous black belly and breast bordered by a bright white fringe. Eurasian <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> are known partly to replace their breeding plumage with striped yellow feathers during incubation, different from both breeding and non-breeding plumages. In this study a similar partial breeding moult {{was observed in}} Pacific <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> and <b>American</b> <b>Golden</b> <b>Plovers</b> caught on the nest or collected during incubation, although the feathers did not differ clearly from those of non-breeders. This moult starts during incubation and precedes the post-breeding moult into non-breeding plumage. Because the lighter feathers reduce {{the contrast between the}} black belly and the white flanks, we suggest that during incubation the plumage characteristic that {{plays an important role in}} mate choice is no longer important; at this stage it is better for the bird to be inconspicuous. Additional information on museum skins of <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> and of Grey Plovers indicated that only the three <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> undergo this partial moult, but that Grey Plovers in general retain full breeding plumage throughout incubation. The three <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> also resemble each other in their generally very passive nest defence strategies. In contrast, the larger Grey Plovers actively chase and attack aerial and ground predators. Thus, a reduced conspicuousness of the body plumage during incubation is likely to benefit the <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> more than the Grey Plover. We suggest that nest defence behaviour, plumage characteristics and perhaps size have co-evolved as a response to different selection pressures in <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> and Grey Plover, but alternative hypotheses are also discussed...|$|R
50|$|Churchill {{is also a}} {{destination}} for bird watchers from late May until August. Birders have recorded more than 270 species within a 25 mi radius of Churchill, including snowy owl, tundra swan, <b>American</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> and gyrfalcon. Plus, more than 100 birds, including parasitic jaeger, Smith's longspur, stilt sandpiper, and Harris's sparrow, nest there.|$|E
50|$|The area {{contains}} several habitats {{which include}} platforms, crevices, rock-pools, boulders and cobbles. Some of the wildlife includes {{a variety of}} birds, such as plovers, ruddy turnstone and red-necked stint. From January to late March 2009, an <b>American</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> was present with a flock of Pacific golden plovers. This species is very rarely recorded in Australia.|$|E
50|$|The European {{golden plover}} (Pluvialis apricaria), {{also known as}} the Eurasian golden plover or just the golden plover within Europe, is a largish plover. This species is similar to two other golden plovers. <b>American</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plover,</b> Pluvialis dominica, and Pacific golden plover, Pluvialis fulva, are both smaller, slimmer and {{relatively}} longer-legged than European golden plover, and both have grey rather than white axillary feathers (only properly visible in flight).|$|E
500|$|A {{review of}} <b>American</b> and Pacific <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> records was begun in 1991, {{with the purpose}} of {{evaluating}} whether any individuals previously accepted as [...] "either American or Pacific" [...] could now be definitely assigned to one species or the other (and vice versa). The results (a small {{decrease in the number of}} accepted <b>American</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plovers,</b> and a small increase in the number of accepted Pacifics) were published in the committee's report for 1996, with a comment that a detailed paper on the subject was being prepared, although as of 2009, this has not been published. A review of isabelline shrike records commenced in 1986. This review, the results of which were published in 1989, established a racial identification for a number of adult isabelline shrikes previously accepted to species level. A further review, with the same aim, was begun in the late 1990s. A preliminary set of results of this review was published in 2003; four previously accepted individuals were rejected, including one, in Cambridgeshire in 1978, which is now thought have been a hybrid with red-backed shrike. The full results of this second review were published in 2007; some of the previous racial attributions were withdrawn, but the committee felt able to confidently assign a race for a number of more recent individuals, although it stressed that this could only be done with adult birds (the committee's 2005 report mentions that a further article is in preparation). A review of black-eared wheatears was conducted in 2002–04, with the aim of assigning individuals to the eastern and western races where possible; this was possible with nine records; both western hispanica and eastern melanoleuca were shown to have occurred.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of a dike across James Bay could negatively impact many mammal species, including ringed and bearded seals, walruses, and bowhead whales, as well as vulnerable populations of polar bears and beluga whales. The impacts would also affect many species of migratory bird, including lesser snow geese, Canada geese, black scoters, brants, American black ducks, northern pintails, mallards, American wigeons, green-winged teals, greater scaups, common eiders, red knots, dunlins, black-bellied, <b>American</b> <b>goldens,</b> and semipalmated <b>plovers,</b> greater and lesser yellowlegs, sanderlings, many species of sandpipers, whimbrels, and marbled godwits, {{as well as the}} critically endangered Eskimo curlew.|$|R

50|$|The {{breeding}} adult <b>American</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> has a black face, neck, breast, and belly, {{with a white}} {{crown and}} nape that extends {{to the side of}} the breast. The back is mottled black and white with pale, gold spots. The breeding female is similar, but with less black. When in , both sexes have grey-brown upperparts, pale grey-brown underparts, and a whitish eyebrow. The head is small, along with the bill.|$|E
50|$|The <b>American</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> lays {{a clutch}} of four white to buff eggs that are heavily blotched with both black and brown spots. The eggs {{generally}} measure around 48 by 33 mm. These eggs are incubated {{for a period of}} 26 to 27 days, with the male incubating during the day and the female during the night. The chicks then hatch , leaving the nest within hours and feeding themselves within a day.|$|E
50|$|This area plays a {{significant}} role in the annual cycle of waterfowl. The funnel-shaped outline of Hudson and James bays causes birds migrating from the Arctic to concentrate at the southern end of James Bay each autumn, particularly in the late autumn, where the extensive coastal wetlands provide critical staging and moulting areas for migrating lesser snow geese, dabbling ducks and shorebirds such as red knot, short-billed dowitcher, dunlin, greater yellowlegs, lesser yellowlegs, ruddy turnstone, and <b>American</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plover.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> across Scotland was modelled using land cover and management variables, {{and used to}} highlight the spatial association between <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> abundance and current and proposed wind farm developments. Overlap was greatest in three biogeographical zones (the Western Isles, the Western Central Belt and the Borders Hills) and was estimated at ca. 5 % of the biogeographical population in each case. New field data were used to predict the effects of wind farm development on <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> populations, employing a conservative analytical approach to detect statistically significant wind farm related effects. The results provide evidence of significant avoidance of wind turbines by breeding <b>golden</b> <b>plovers</b> to a distance of at least 200 metres. Furthermore, wind farm sites appear to support lower densities of <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> than predicted by the distribution model for sites without wind farms. Therefore, there is evidence for negative effects of wind farm developments on <b>golden</b> <b>plover,</b> and we suggest strategies to reduce any potential conflict between the need to promote wind energy {{and the need to}} maintain <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> populations...|$|R

In the 1800s millions of Eskimo curlews followed migration routes from the present Yukon and Northwest Territories, flying east along the northern shore of Canada, then south over the Atlantic Ocean to South America in the winter. When returning to North America, they would fly north through the Great Plains.|$|E
50|$|Cemlyn has {{attracted}} a number of vagrant birds. It is most famous among twitchers as the site where a bridled tern spent several weeks in July 1988, and where the similarly rare (in a British context) sooty tern was present on and off in July 2005. Both species had at these times been seen by {{only a very small}} number of birders in Britain. Also at Cemlyn in 2005 were an <b>American</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plover</b> in May and a Terek sandpiper in June. In 1998, an isabelline shrike was present for most of the month of July.|$|E
50|$|For {{reasons not}} fully known, Clarión {{seems to be}} more {{attractive}} to shorebirds and other vagrant or migrant birds than Socorro; perhaps {{this is due to the}} presence of red-tailed hawks on the latter island. Great blue heron, snowy egret, white-faced ibis, Pacific and possibly <b>American</b> <b>golden</b> <b>plover,</b> spotted sandpiper, wandering tattler, ruddy turnstone, black-necked stilt, western gull and barn swallow are examples of the species that can be encountered on Clarión with some regularity; most of the shorebirds congregate in the sheltered shallows of Sulphur Bay. Others, such as blue-winged teal, western sandpiper, least sandpiper, short-eared owl, belted kingfisher, northern mockingbird and brown-headed cowbird have only been recorded on very few occasions, sometimes only once.|$|E
