Encompassed in these terms, especially the Auger yield, which is related to the transition probability, is the quantum mechanical overlap of the initial and final state wave functions. Precise expressions for the transition probability, based on first-order perturbation Hamiltonians, can be found in Thompson and Baker. Often, all of these terms are not known, so most analyses compare measured yields with external standards of known composition. Ratios of the acquired data to standards can eliminate common terms, especially experimental setup characteristics and material parameters, and can be used to determine element composition. Comparison techniques work best for samples of homogeneous binary materials or uniform surface layers, while elemental identification is best obtained from comparison of pure samples.|$|E

40|$|Modern 5 -axis {{machining}} centers {{enable the}} {{development and use of}} new machining kinematics and grinding strategies to grind workpieces with superabrasives mounted points. One of these technologies is the oscillating surface grinding (OSG), which can improve the surface characteristics and the tribological properties of machined surfaces. In the current contribution could be observed that the resultant surface roughness values by OSG are not constant within a wavelength of oscillation of the grinding tool. This leads to further studies of the kinematics involved in this process, resulting {{in the development of a}} new grinding strategy: the tilt surface grinding (TSG). By using TSG, workpiece surfaces with similar characteristics as OSG could be obtained even without aid of oscillation. In this study, experimental tests are carried out to investigate the influence of parameters involved in these strategies. A significant parameter is the tilt <b>angle</b> <b>t,</b> which can be simplified as an angle between the directions of the feed rate in tangential direction vft and the feed rate in axial direction vfa of the grinding tool. The tilt <b>angle</b> <b>t</b> is responsible for changes occurred on the OSG when compared to conventional surface grinding. Increasing the tilt <b>angle</b> <b>t,</b> a reduction up to 50 % of the roughness values could be achieved.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{morphology}} and morphometry of lapillus otoliths of the catfishes Cathorops spixii and Genidens genidens from the coast of Paraná State, Brazil. We used 147 lapillus from C. spixii and 96 from G. genidens, of different size classes. Otoliths were characterized with smooth margins for both species but with different shapes: oblong for C. spixii and oval for G. genidens. The morphological differentiation between the two species is in the anterior region: rounded for C. spixii and pointed for G. genidens. The t-test results for otolith measurements were: length (t value = - 2. 88; p = 0. 0042), height (t value = - 6. 87; p < 0. 000001), anterior <b>angle</b> (<b>t</b> value= 9. 84; p = 0. 000001) and posterior <b>angle</b> (<b>t</b> value = 0. 41; p = 0. 68).

Two parameters, namely, gonial flexure and minimum ramal breadth were measured using Agfa Nx software for each digital radiograph.

Methods: A dummy cast (plastic cast) of one patient with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis was created {{in order to test}} the reliability of the MTS. The dummy cast was positioned and rotated in 3 D while scanned by two investigators using the MTS. A total of twelve parameters including Q-angle (an analog to X-ray’s Cobb angle) were extracted. Results: All measurements of intra-rater and inter-rater reliability were excellent (Intraclass Correlation Coefficients ranging from 0. 89 to 0. 99) with the exception of Pelvic Tilt (intra-rater ICC is 0. 61) and lordosis angle (inter-rater ICC is 0. 82).
