5|$|Smith {{acted as}} the sole {{administrator}} <b>and</b> <b>instructor</b> of the medical school until 1810, when a second faculty member was hired. Smith also revamped the curriculum, allowing the school to begin offering the Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree in 1812. Smith ultimately left Dartmouth in 1816, founding three additional schools of medicine at Yale University, Bowdoin College, and the University of Vermont.|$|E
5|$|The Student <b>and</b> <b>Instructor</b> {{models were}} also {{introduced}} in the late 1960s. They were designed to teach the piano in the classroom.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} and analyze perceptional differences among department chairs, faculty, <b>and</b> <b>instructors</b> toward the barrier to using multiple teaching strategies in two-year technical and community college electronics courses. The literature review focused on defining multiple teaching strategies and identifying and discussing four major perceived barriers to implementing them in the electronics classroom: student, resources, classroom environmental, and teacher training/teaching technology. The targeted population consisted of 150 out of 231 electronics teaching technical and community college department chairs, faculty, <b>and</b> <b>instructors</b> throughout the state of Texas. In actuality, the targeted population’s breakdown consisted of 36 full-time electronics teaching department chairs, 96 full-time electronics teaching faculty <b>and</b> <b>instructors,</b> <b>and</b> 18 part-time electronics teaching faculty <b>and</b> <b>instructors</b> who were actively involved in the delivery of instruction in their respective schools. Analysis of the data revealed that: (1) there are no significant differences among the perceptions of department chair people, faculty, <b>and</b> <b>instructors</b> toward the four perceived barriers to implementing multiple teaching strategies in a post-secondar...|$|R

5|$|Having {{finished}} her studies, Morton {{returned to the}} United States in 1902 and opened a medical practice specialising in gynecology in Washington D.C. After marrying George Morton Jr., she opened a new medical practice in New York, where he was an attorney. In 1909 the American Medical Association created a Public Health Education Committee {{with the aim of}} educating the public on subjects including health, hygiene, child care, and other medical topics; they made Morton its first chairperson. Morton was appointed as a clinical assistant <b>and</b> <b>instructor</b> at the Polyclinic Hospital of New York (where {{she was one of the}} first female faculty members), and later became a professor of gynecology. During this time she lectured at a number of other universities including a summer at the University of Vermont.|$|E

He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988. He helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in Altgeld Gardens. Obama also worked as a consultant <b>and</b> <b>instructor</b> for the Gamaliel Foundation, a community organizing institute. In mid-1988, he traveled {{for the first time in}} Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya, where he met many of his paternal relatives for the first time.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Moser {{enrolled}} at the University of Innsbruck, taking classes in botany, zoology, geology, physics and chemistry. At this time, Austria was {{under the control of}} Nazi Germany and did not exist as an independent state. Moser became an authorised mushroom controller <b>and</b> <b>instructor,</b> and it was officially requested that he attend mycological seminars around Germany and Austria. At these seminars, he met a number of prominent mycologists, including Ernst Thirring. Thirring showed Moser some of the issues surrounding the large genus Cortinarius, which remained an interest {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1943, aged 19 and after only three terms at Innsbruck, his studies were interrupted so he could perform military service. Having shown earlier promise in languages, he was trained as an interpreter, then sent to the Balkan Peninsula. He continued to show an active interest in mycology, collecting and identifying mushrooms and reading Rolf Singer's Das System der Agaricales.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} {{member of the}} new ensemble was Laura Peverara, followed by Livia d'Arco and Anna Guarini, daughter of the prolific poet Giovanni Battista Guarini. Giovanni wrote poems for many of the madrigals which were set for the ensemble, and choreographed scenes for the balletto delle donne. Judith Tick believes Tarquinia Molza sang with the group, but Anthony Newcomb says she was involved solely as an advisor <b>and</b> <b>instructor.</b> Whether Tarquinia Molza ever performed with them or not, she was ousted from any role in the group after her affair with the composer Giaches de Wert came to light in 1589. Luzzasco Luzzaschi directed and composed music to showcase the ensemble, and accompanied them on the harpsichord. Ippolito Fiorini was the maestro di capella, in charge of the entire court's musical activities. In addition to his duties to the overall court, he accompanied the concerto on the lute. Vittorio Baldini was brought to the court as ducal music printer in 1582.|$|E

40|$|Exercise {{managers}} <b>and</b> <b>instructors</b> have {{a particularly}} challenging task in monitoring and controlling on-going exercises, which may involve multiple response teams and organizations in highly complex and continuously evolving crisis situations. Managers <b>and</b> <b>instructors</b> must handle potentially incomplete and conflicting field-observation data {{and make decisions}} in real-time {{in order to control}} the flow of the exercise and to keep it in line with the training objectives. In simulation-based exercises, managers <b>and</b> <b>instructors</b> have access to a rich set of real-time data, with an increased potential to closely monitor the trainees’ actions, and to keep the exercise on track. To assist exercise managers <b>and</b> <b>instructors,</b> data about the on-going exercise can be filtered, aggregated and refined by real-time decision-support systems. We have developed a model and a prototype decision-support system, using stream-based reasoning to assist exercise managers <b>and</b> <b>instructors</b> in real-time. The approach takes advantage of topic maps for ontological representation and a complex-event processing engine for analyzing the data stream from a virtual-reality simulator for crisis-management training. Aggregated data is presented both on-screen, in Twitter, and in the form of topic maps. CRISIS - Critical Incident management training System using an Interactive Simulation environmen...|$|R
