40|$|How {{much of the}} <b>Arab</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Market</b> {{provisions}} are actually implemented? And which member country benefits relatively more than the others from the Common Market arrangement? These are the two major questions that this research attempts to provide answers for. At present, the <b>Arab</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Market</b> is comprised of six member countries: Jordan, Syria, Iraq, Libya, Mauritania, and Democratic Yemen. Egypt was also a member until 1979 when its membership was suspended because of the Camp David Agreements. The first three {{are considered to be}} more advanced and {{were among the first to}} ratify the Common Market resolution as soon as it was passed in 1965. Accordingly, they are supposed to form a free trade area and are also supposed to be working on establishing a common external tariff against the outside world. Libya joined the Common Market in 1977. Mauritania and Democratic Yemen joined in 1980 and 1981 respectively. However, both were considered to be less advanced and were allowed to exclude a list of products from trade liberalization either to protect domestic industry or for revenue purposes. Goods not included in their exceptions lists were to be liberalized in a gradual process that will extend until 1988 for Mauritania and 1990 for Democratic Yemen. Currently, a free trade area is in operation for Jordan, Syria, and Iraq, at least as far as the removal of tariffs is concerned. However, some other non-tariff barriers are still practiced, such as licensing and foreign exchange allocations. Libya still excludes a number of items from trade liberalization with the objective of protecting domestic industry. Mauritania and Democratic Yemen joined the Common Market in 1980 and 1981; because they are considered to be less advanced, they still have until 1988 and 1990 respectively to implement the trade liberalization program. At present, both Iraq and Syria practice state trading and foreign trade planning. State trading could have a significant, positive or negative, impact on directing trade towards partner countries. It definitely weakens the causal relationship between market forces and trade flows, and subjects trade more to political factors. Because of the extensive use of state trading by Iraq and Syria, trade among member countries of the <b>Arab</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Market</b> fluctuates considerably, dropping when political relationships are tense to negligible amounts and increasing when friendly relationships dominate to an amount not justifiable by market forces alone. This was achieved without resorting to any of the traditional commercial policy tools. The second question regarding who benefits relatively more from the <b>Arab</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Market</b> was answered by looking at trade creation and trade diversion for each country and by looking at the volume of exports of each country to the other Common Market members and the degree of protection that those exports enjoy in their respective markets. Jordan experienced a high degree of trade creation; it has the largest volume of exports, and its exports enjoy the highest degree of protection in the Syrian and Iraqi markets. Based on these criteria, Jordan is assumed to benefit more from the Common Market arrangement. The research also identified other areas of research. Such areas include ex ante measurements of benefits for countries which are still reluctant to join the Common Market and an analysis of the impact of joint projects on the economies of the countries in which they are located and on other members. This is supposed to lead to a formula for allocating industries among member countries. One conclusion of this research is that a pure rational approach will be insufficient for analyzing the impacts of economic integration, and that a multiple perspectives approach is a must for such an analysis...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the changes that}} occurred in the Kuwaiti economy as a result of rapid growth, and the regional economic implications of public policies of a small developing state. It is a case of rapid growth and accumulation of finance in excess of productive capacity. Affluence is derived from oil. One cannot pretend that the economic analysis emphasizing allocation of resources is satisfactory. Yet unfortunately the core of development’ economics has failed to present an adequate analysis of the main aspects of the development process. The thesis can be loosely divided into two parts. The first part is concerned with the behavioural characteristics of the economy. Chapter 2, discusses the dualism of the economy as represented by its factoral imbalance. The discussion of the trends, terms, and composition of foreign trade in Chapter 3 develops the theme of the economy's levels of growth and degrees of sectoral imbalance. Chapter 4 » surveys the present industrial structure in Kuwait, pointing out the importance of complementarities, and external economies. The second part of the thesis reviews Kuwait's industrialization plans given the present state of the country's economic development. Kuwait's industrialization plans take note of the present dominant characteristics of the economy and suggest industrial development along the lines of unbalanced growth (Chapter 5). Chapter 6, uses static analysis to discuss Kuwait's cooperation endeavours. The dynamics of regional integration, and the availability of elements of complementary and diversified industrial structure in an active <b>Arab</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Market,</b> suggest the favourable long-run implications of this market, and cooperation in general, for Kuwait's industrial development. Statistically, it is more feasible to study long periods. However, to avoid breaks in the series or incomplete or provisional data, the period 1961 to 1973 has been used, almost exclusively. A number of statistical tables, being only available in a fragmented form and scattered in a diversity of sources, were compiled and reorganised by the candidate.

However, the Arab Independence Party was formed by Palestinian and Iraqi activists from al-Fatat {{as a direct result}} of the Jerusalem conference on 13 August 1932. Most of the AIP's activities were centered in the Palestinian political field, but the party also worked towards achieving Arab unity and solidarity as a means to strengthen Arab resistance against the British Mandate in Palestine and increased Jewish settlement occurring there. In August 1933, the League of Nationalist Action (LNA) was founded in Lebanon by Western-educated professional civil service groups with the aims of creating a <b>common</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>market</b> and industrial base as well as the abolishment of customs barriers between the Arab countries. By proposing agrarian reforms to limit the power of landowners, abolishing what they considered [...] "feudalism" [...] and promoting the growth of an industry, the LNA sought to undermine the absentee landlords in the Levant who tended to encourage local nationalism and were open to working with European authorities or Jewish land purchasers. The LNA enjoyed a level of popularity throughout the 1930s, but did not survive into the 1940s.|$|R

40|$|MENA {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{globally}} and regionally integrated regions in the world. Though home to 5. 5 percent of the world’s population and 3. 9 percent of the world’s GDP, the region’s share of nonoil world trade is only 1. 8 percent. Deep economic integration could help policy makers address the critical development challenges that have been brought to the forefront by the Arab Spring by boosting growth, fostering diversification, and stimulating employment. The level of tariff protection vis-à-vis {{the rest of the world}} remains high by international standards, particularly in North Africa. Nontariff measures have become the most important barriers to trade in goods in the Arab world. Trade in services is extremely limited. To boost services trade, reforms will be required to ease entry and licensing restrictions, promote competition, harmonize and strengthen regulatory practices and arrangements, and lower restrictions on the mobility of foreign workers residing in the region. Continued public ownership in some services sectors also represents a hurdle to service flows. Backbone services such as telecommunications, financial services, transport, and power are crucial to boosting productivity and international competitiveness. Building strategic infrastructure networks while opening infrastructure services to competition and trade could help reduce production costs, increase foreign direct investment, promote knowledge spillovers, and expand markets. Logistics performance, which varies substantially across countries, has generally been constrained by slow and ineffective introduction of risk management, little effort to monitor customs performance at the border, and insufficiently improved facilities at border crossings. Priority should be accorded to measures that improve the efficiency of border crossing points, including through the harmonization of customs procedures. The proliferation of PTAs, with their different sector and product coverage, rules of origin, and implementation requirements, poses a formidable challenge for capacity-constrained MENA institutions. If an Arab Customs Union is to be established by 2015 and an <b>Arab</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Market</b> by 2020, then efforts will need to be made to strengthen the rules and discipline applicable to PAFTA and other regional trade agreements. Mechanisms for tracking and enforcing commitments to regional economic integration also need to be strengthened. ...|$|E
