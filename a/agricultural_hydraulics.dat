50|$|After the Second World War, and the {{repatriation}} of Italian colonists from Africa, the IAO {{collaborated with the}} Italian trust administration in Somalia, by supplying technical skills to the newly formed Somali federal government. It also assisted Italian farmers migrating to Latin America, who were benefited by the same services, such as training, technical assistance, investments planning, etc., created {{for the development of}} the Italian colonies. Such work was completed with the reshaping of the Institute endowments, under directors Armando Maugini, Ferdinando Bigi, and Arturo Marassi. Once the Italian agricultural migration flow faded, at the beginning of the 1970s, the Institute shifted its focus to the development co-operation policies of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, along the patterns established by Law n. 38 (1979) and Law n. 49 (1987). Such laws established the development co-operation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, collaborating with other scientific and technical institutions, in Italy and abroad. Since 1974, Prof. Nicola Matarrese, following the plenipotentiary Minister Ernesto Mario Bolasco, gives a decisive contribution in shaping the future development of the activity of the Institute in the framework of laws already in processing and then issued as indicated above. Matarrese leaves the direction of the IAO in 1977 to devote himself to full-time teaching of <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Hydraulics</b> at the Faculty of Agriculture of the University of Bari.|$|E
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Agronómica - Ramo de Engenharia Rural - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaConsulting on <b>agricultural</b> <b>hydraulics</b> {{and rural}} {{development}} has been the main activity of the author {{in the last two}} decades. A large part of the professional career was devoted to studies and design of hydraulic infrastructures for the establishment of irrigation in Portugal. The recent years of his professional career focused on the internationalization of consulting services by drafting general plans, technical advises, design projects, training and specialized technical assistance to farmers and technicians. Angola and Cape Verde have been the stage of action. The present document was written with two main objectives: to obtain a Master of Science degree and to share with the community some relevant aspects of author’s work experience. The document was structured to emphasize three major units: the <b>agricultural</b> <b>hydraulics,</b> rural development and studies and projects. For these units were selected groups of activities considered relevant to the author's career: Alqueva Multi-Purpose Scheme, Rehabilitation and Modernization of Hydro-agricultural Schemes, Other Studies and Projects, Master Plans and Reports and Agriculture and Rural Development. In every activity is highlighted the aspects considered most important and which reflect the author's experience...|$|E
40|$|Annual {{rainfall}} is {{of great}} importance to every nation and provides useful data on <b>agricultural,</b> hydrology and <b>hydraulics</b> designs. The research study presents {{the evaluation of the}} hydropower potential of river Orle using the analytical potential interpolation of hydrological elements (Rainfall, river discharges e. t. c) with emphasis of developing 1. 032 MW power plant-reservoirs. Hydropower is a renewable energy source based on the natural water cycle and most mature, reliable and cost-effective renewable power generation technology. Gumbel’s Probability Distribution method, U. S Soil Conservation technique and empirical formulation were used to estimate maximum flood design, rainfall distribution and intensity and peak river flow. The hydrological data provided by Benin-Owena River Basin stationed in Auchi Polytechnic were applied for the analysis. The outputs revealed that annual average rainfall of 98. 1 mm or more in 75 -year; 130. 1 mm or more in 50 -year out of 100 years. The exceedence probability for a rainfall of 158. 1 mm is 0. 25 with observed rainfall greater than normal. At discharge (10. 77 * 10 - 2 m 3 /s), the proposed Orle hydropower scheme generated 1. 032 MW during the peak of wet and 76. 6 KW was evaluated during the drying season at (0. 80 * 10 - 2 m 3 /s). The study draws a conclusion that for runoff river scheme at 41. 7...|$|R
40|$|Landscape {{represents}} the &ldquo;sensory aspect&rdquo; {{of the land}} and as such it can be appreciated by all the five senses: sight, smelling, hearing, touch and taste. At the same time, landscape evolves over time and its value &ndash; ecological, economical and affective &ndash; changes as its constitutive elements change. Engineering can help &ldquo;to drive&rdquo; this evolution addressing it towards a condition of balance between individual and community requirements, especially referred to the effect of technological development on landscape. This effect can be referred to three dimensions: perceptive, functional and symbolic dimensions. The possible contribution to the management of landscape changes concerns all the three historic souls of Agricultural Engineering; in particular, <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Hydraulics</b> deals with the topic of landscape referring to both irrigation and the possible recreational use of canal systems; Agricultural Engineering determines plot form and size and woodland view; Rural Building deals with both the recovery of existing buildings and the design and making of new ones and their fitting in the landscape; moreover, the sector has developed new methods for the evaluation and the planning of rural land resources, especially about agriculture and forestry productivity, ecological stability and visual quality of rural land itself...|$|E

The most important aspects that corroborate my experience are highlighted within each activity included in this repor...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the Portuguese {{engineers}} who returned to Portugal following a training period at École des Ponts et Chaussées, in Paris between 1831 and 1870. During the 19 th century, {{in spite of the}} creation of engineering schools, such as the Military Academy (1836), the Polytechnic School of Lisbon (1837), the Polytechnic Academy of Oporto (1837), the number of engineers to ensure the planning and the direction of the public works remained insufficient. Moreover, the education provided by these schools granted almost no room for fieldwork. Like in the other European States, some Portuguese engineers tried to complete their training in foreign countries, in particular by attending schools such as the École des Ponts et Chaussées de Paris. The studies which they carried out as well as the projects and the “missions d’études” enabled them to intervene in various areas, from the construction of bridges and railways to <b>agricultural</b> <b>hydraulics</b> on their return to Portugal. Following their return, these engineers played an important role both in the transfer of knowledge as well as in updating Portuguese engineering. They designed and directed various public works and transmitted to their subordinates the most modern methods of planning and construction of roads, railways and seaports. In addition, they were appointed to political and administrative positions in particular within the Ministério das Obras Públicas, Comércio e Indústria created in 1852, in the context of which they had to evaluate, authorize or reject various engineering projects. Finally, some were appointed professors in Portuguese engineering schools where they taught new theories, methods and practices of civil engineering which they had learnt in Paris or during trips abroad...|$|E
