5|$|The less-prominent women {{mentioned}} in the play are subordinated <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> are only described through {{the men of the}} play. Most of what is said about Sycorax, for example, is said by Prospero. Further, Stephen Orgel notes that Prospero has never met Sycorax – all he learned about her he learned from Ariel. According to Orgel, Prospero's suspicion of women makes him an unreliable source of information. Orgel suggests that he is sceptical of female virtue in general, citing his ambiguous remark about his wife's fidelity.|$|E

It was a memorable year for Somerset <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> won the Gillette Cup and Sunday League under Rose's captaincy. Denning was a good limited overs player having the ability to run quick singles. The following year, in partnership with Ian Botham, he added 310 for the fourth wicket against Gloucestershire at Taunton in 1980, which remains a record for Somerset.|$|E
25|$|Feijenoord's again won a {{division}} title {{with a national}} championship in 1940, their fifth Dutch title. During the German occupation of the Netherlands, play continued in Dutch football leagues, though the 1945 championship was cancelled as the war came to its conclusion. During this period, Feijenoord's only trophy was {{a division}}al championship in 1943. After the war, Feijenoord did not perform <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> had in previous decades, not seriously challenging in their division and so missing the national playoff rounds.|$|E

25|$|Due to the devadasi being equated to prostitutes, {{they also}} became {{associated}} with the spreading of venereal disease in India. During the British Colonial period, many British soldiers were exposed to venereal disease in the various brothels being operated at that time. As such, devadasis were misunderstood {{to be responsible for}} this. In efforts to control the spread of venereal disease, the British Government mandated that all prostitutes register themselves, with devadasis being forced to do this <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were thought to be prostitutes by the British Government.|$|E

Charlie Griffiths, the guitarist {{for the band}} Linear Sphere and Anchorhead became a {{full-time}} member of the band.

Mexican keyboardist Diego Tejeida auditioned and eventually joined the band in late 2008 <b>as</b> <b>well.</b> <b>As</b> <b>they</b> began to tour more, even opening a few UK shows for King's X, Sensory Records recognized them and offered them a record deal.

25|$|And so, {{in modern}} times, when liberties {{are to be}} taken, and the {{intrusive}} passions of men to be indulged, precedent and permission, or what sounds like them, may be easily found and quoted for everything. But Samuel, in God's Name, silenced all this, giving them to understand, that in His sight the whole {{was a question of}} motive and purpose, not of ostensible and colourable argument;—in His sight, I say, to Whom we, <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>they,</b> are nationally responsible for much more than the soundness of our deductions as matter of disputation, or of law; we are responsible for the meaning and temper in which we deal with His Holy Church, established among us for the salvation of our souls.|$|E
25|$|The Greed Killing EP was {{the next}} release from the band, through Earache. After the preview with the EP, Diatribes, a {{full-length}} album was released. Although things {{seemed to be going}} smoothly from outside, they were going through problems. Misunderstanding arose between the members and singer Greenway was expelled from the band in late/mid 1996. Greenway went to record with Extreme Noise Terror (the ENT release Damage 381 features Barney on lead vocals) and ENT's main singer Phil Vane went to fill vocals slot in Napalm Death. Things did not go <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> were supposed to, and Vane was kicked out of the band just before they got into the studio to record the new album.

25|$|The kidneys and {{intestines}} of a camel {{are very}} efficient at reabsorbing water. Camels' kidneys have a 1:4 cortex to medulla ratio. Thus medullary part of camel's kidneys occupy {{twice as much}} area as a cow's kidney. Secondly, renal corpuscles have a smaller diameter, which reduces surface area for filtration. These two major anatomical characteristics enable camel to conserve water and limit the volume of urine in extreme desert conditions. Camel urine comes out as a thick syrup, and camel feces are so dry {{that they do not}} require drying when the Bedouins use them to fuel fires. The camels are able to live in difficult conditions without drinking water due to their ability to produce small and pretty dry droppings <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> use the water to maintain their body’s temperature to fit with the region surrounding them (Breulmann, et al., 2007).|$|E
25|$|The {{expedition}} {{arrived at}} Lake Tanganyika in February 1858. Burton was awestruck {{by the sight}} of the magnificent lake, but Speke, who had been temporarily blinded, was unable to see the body of water. By this point much of their surveying equipment was lost, ruined, or stolen, and they were unable to complete surveys of the area <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> wished. Burton was again taken ill on the return journey, and Speke continued exploring without him, making a journey to the north and eventually locating the great Lake Victoria, or Victoria Nyanza. Lacking supplies and proper instruments, Speke was unable to survey the area properly but was privately convinced that it was the long sought source of the Nile. Burton's description of the journey is given in Lake Regions of Equatorial Africa (1860). Speke gave his own account in The Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the Nile (1863).|$|E
25|$|During World War I, Fleming {{witnessed}} {{the death of}} many soldiers from sepsis resulting from infected wounds. Antiseptics, which were used {{at the time to}} treat infected wounds, often worsened the injuries. In an article he submitted for the medical journal The Lancet during World War I, Fleming described an ingenious experiment, which he was able to conduct {{as a result of his}} own glass blowing skills, in which he explained why antiseptics were killing more soldiers than infection itself during World War I. Antiseptics worked well on the surface, but deep wounds tended to shelter anaerobic bacteria from the antiseptic agent, and antiseptics seemed to remove beneficial agents produced that protected the patients in these cases at least <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> removed bacteria, and did nothing to remove the bacteria that were out of reach. Sir Almroth Wright strongly supported Fleming's findings, but despite this, most army physicians over the course of the war continued to use antiseptics even in cases where this worsened the condition of the patients.|$|E

25|$|The next morning, the German vanguard found a {{weak point}} {{between the two}} armies and many German troops were able to cross the Autobahn before the Soviet forces plugged the gap. The {{fighting}} was heavy and included continuous air attacks by the 2nd Air Army, as well as tree-bursting shells which rained wood splinters through the area. During the battle, the Soviet air force flew 2,459 attack missions and 1,683 bombing sorties. The German forces found {{that they could not}} use their armour <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> had hoped, because it was vulnerable to destruction on the roads and could not get a good grip on the sandy soil of the pine forests in the region. The German vanguard managed to reach and cross Reichsstrasse 96, south of Zossen and north of Baruth, where it was spotted by a Luftwaffe plane. Hitler was furious when he realised that Busse was attempting to break out west and not to come to his aid in Berlin. His command sent several messages demanding that the army turn towards Berlin, but received no answer.|$|E
