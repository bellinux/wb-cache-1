5|$|In Toraja society, {{the funeral}} ritual {{is the most}} {{elaborate}} and expensive event. The richer and more powerful the individual, the more expensive is the funeral. In the aluk religion, only nobles {{have the right to}} have an extensive death feast. The death feast of a nobleman is usually attended by thousands and lasts for several days. A ceremonial site, called rante, is usually prepared in a large, grassy field where shelters for audiences, rice barns, and other ceremonial funeral structures are specially made by the deceased family. Flute music, funeral chants, songs and poems, <b>and</b> <b>crying</b> and wailing are traditional Toraja expressions of grief with the exceptions of funerals for young children, and poor, low-status adults.|$|E

40|$|Thirteen of {{the most}} common lepidopteran-specific Cry {{proteins}} of Bacillus thuringiensis have been tested for their efficacy against newly hatched larvae of two populations of the spiny bollworm, Earias insulana. At a concentration of 100 μg of toxin per milliliter of artificial diet, six Cry toxins (Cry 1 Ca, Cry 1 Ea, Cry 1 Fa, Cry 1 Ja, <b>Cry</b> 2 Aa, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 2 Ab) were not toxic at all. Cry 1 Aa, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ja, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 2 Aa did not cause mortality but caused significant inhibition of growth. The other Cry toxins (Cry 1 Ab, Cry 1 Ac, Cry 1 Ba, Cry 1 Da, <b>Cry</b> 1 Ia, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca) were toxic to E. insulana larvae. The 50 % lethal concentration values of these toxins ranged from 0. 39 to 21. 13 μg/ml (for <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ia, respectively) for an E. insulana laboratory colony originating from Egypt and from 0. 20 to 4. 25 μg/ml (for <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Da, respectively) for a laboratory colony originating from Spain. The relative potencies of the toxins in the population from Egypt were highest for <b>Cry</b> 9 Ca <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ab, <b>and</b> they were both significantly more toxic than <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ba, followed by <b>Cry</b> 1 Da <b>and</b> finally <b>Cry</b> 1 Ia. In the population from Spain, Cry 9 Ca was the most toxic, followed in decreasing order by <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ba, <b>and</b> the least toxic was Cry 1 Da.

25|$|The most {{important}} proteins {{which make up}} the mammalian TTNFL are the Period (PER), <b>and</b> Cryptochrome (<b>CRY)</b> proteins, BMAL1, CLOCK, and casein kinase 1 epsilon. PER <b>and</b> <b>CRY</b> levels are regulated by negative feedback, meaning that they repress their own transcription. BMAL1 and CLOCK work to increase PER <b>and</b> <b>CRY</b> transcription by binding on the E-box domain upstream from the PER <b>and</b> <b>CRY</b> gene coding sequences. The level of PER <b>and</b> <b>CRY</b> proteins is regulated by casein kinase 1 through phosphorylation, which marks these proteins for degradation by the cell. Phosphorylation also hinders PER's ability to enter the nucleus by inducing a conformational change in its nuclear localization sequence. However, if CRY proteins bind to PER before this phosphorylation can occur, all three proteins stabilize into a complex that can enter the nucleus. Once inside the nucleus, PER <b>and</b> <b>CRY</b> can work to inhibit their own transcription, while casein kinase 1 epsilon works to modulate the activity of BMAL1 and CLOCK through phosphorylation.|$|R

50|$|A similar {{model is}} found in mice, in which BMAL1 dimerizes with CLOCK to {{activate}} per <b>and</b> cryptochrome (<b>cry)</b> transcription. PER <b>and</b> <b>CRY</b> proteins form a heterodimer which acts on the CLOCK-BMAL heterodimer to repress the transcription of per <b>and</b> <b>cry.</b> The heterodimer CLOCK:BMAL1 functions similarly to other transcriptional activator complexes; CLOCK:BMAL1 interacts with the E-box regulatory elements.

40|$|Insecticidal {{activity}} and receptor binding properties of Bacillus thuringiensis toxins to yellow and striped rice stem borers (Sciropophaga incertulas and Chilo suppresalis, respectively) were investigated. Yellow stem borer (YSB) was susceptible to Cry 1 Aa, Cry 1 Ac, <b>Cry</b> 2 A, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 C toxins with similar toxicities. To striped stem borer (SSB), Cry 1 Ac, <b>Cry</b> 2 A, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 C were more toxic than Cry 1 Aa toxin. Binding assays were performed with (sup 125) I-labeled toxins (Cry 1 Aa, Cry 1 Ac, <b>Cry</b> 2 A, <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 C) <b>and</b> brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) prepared from YSB and SSB midguts. Both <b>Cry</b> 1 Aa <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac toxins showed saturable, high-affinity binding to YSB BBMV. <b>Cry</b> 2 A <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 C toxins bound to YSB BBMV with relatively low binding affinity but with high binding site concentration. To SSB, both <b>Cry</b> 1 Aa <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac exhibited high binding affinity, although these toxins are less toxic than <b>Cry</b> 1 C <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 2 A. <b>Cry</b> 1 C <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 2 A toxins bound to SSB BBMV with relatively low binding affinity but with high binding site concentration.

The results showed that <b>Cry</b> 1 Aa <b>and</b> <b>Cry</b> 1 Ac recognize the same binding site, which {{is different from the}} Cry 2 A or Cry 1 C binding site in YSB and SSB. These data suggest that development of multitoxin systems in transgenic rice with toxin combinations which recognize different binding sites may be useful in implementing deployment strategies that decrease the rate of pest adaptation to B. thuringiensis toxin-expressing rice varieties...|$|R
