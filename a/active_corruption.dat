40|$|Multiparty {{computation}} (MPC) among n {{parties can}} tolerate up to t < n/ 2 <b>active</b> <b>corruptions</b> in a synchronous communication setting; however, in an asynchronous communication setting, the resiliency bound decreases to only t < n/ 3 <b>active</b> <b>corruptions.</b> We improve the resiliency bound for asynchronous MPC (AMPC) to match synchronous MPC using non-equivocation. Non-equivocation {{is a message}} authentication mechanism to restrict a corrupted sender from mak-ing conflicting statements to different (honest) parties. It can be implemented using an increment-only counter and a digital signature oracle, realizable with trusted hardware modules readily available in com-modity computers and smartphone devices. A non-equivocation mechanism can also be transferable and allow a receiver to verifiably transfer the authenticated statement to other parties. In this work, using transferable non-equivocation, we present an AMPC protocol tolerating t < n/ 2 faults. From a practical point of view, our AMPC protocol requires fewer setup assumptions than the previous AMPC protocol with t < n/ 2 by Beerliová-Trubı́niová, Hirt and Nielsen [PODC 2010]: unlike their AMPC protocol, {{it does not require}} any synchronous broadcast round {{at the beginning of the}} protocol and avoids the threshold homomorphic encryption setup assumption. Moreover, our AMPC protocol is also efficient and provides a gain of Θ(n) in the communication complexity per multiplication gate, over the AMPC protocol of Beerliová-Trubı́niova ́ et al. In the process, using non-equivocation, we also define the first asynchronous verifiable secret sharing (AVSS) scheme with t < n/ 2, which is of independent interest to threshold cryptography. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The goal of Multi-Party Computation (MPC) is {{to perform}} an {{arbitrary}} computation in a distributed, private, and fault-tolerant way. For this purpose, a fixed set of n parties runs a protocol that tolerates an adversary corrupting {{a subset of the}} parties, preserving certain security guarantees like correctness, secrecy, robustness, and fairness. Corruptions can be either passive or active: A passively corrupted party follows the protocol correctly, but the adversary learns the entire internal state of this party. An actively corrupted party is completely controlled by the adversary, and may deviate arbitrarily from the protocol. A mixed adversary may at the same time corrupt some parties actively and some additional parties passively. In this work, we consider the statistical setting with mixed adversaries and study the exact consequences of <b>active</b> and passive <b>corruptions</b> on secrecy, correctness, robustness, and fairness separately (i. e., hybrid security). Clearly, the number of passive corruptions affects the thresholds for secrecy, while the number of <b>active</b> <b>corruptions</b> affects all thresholds. It turns out that in the statistical setting, the number of passive corruptions in particular also affects the threshold for correctness, i. e., in all protocols there are (tolerated) adversaries for which a single additional passive corruption is sufficient to break correctness. This is in contrast to both the perfect and the computational setting, where such an influence cannot be observed. Apparently, this effect arises from the use of information-theoretic signatures, which are part of most (if not all) statistical protocols...|$|R

The Managers of the Commons, feeling this, went up to their constituents to procure from them the means of reducing it within a compass fitter for their management and for your Lordships' judgment. Being furnished with this power, a second selection was made upon the principles of the first: not upon the idea that what we left could be less clearly sustained, but because we thought a selection should be made upon some juridical principle. With this impression on our minds, we reduced the whole cause to four great heads of guilt and criminality. Two of them, namely, Benares and the Begums, show the effects of his open violence and injustice; the other two expose the principles of pecuniary corruption upon which the prisoner proceeded: one of these displays his passive corruption in receiving bribes, and the other his <b>active</b> <b>corruption,</b> in which he has endeavored to defend his passive corruption by forming a most formidable faction both abroad and at home. There is hardly any one act of the prisoner's corruption in which there is not presumptive violence, nor any acts of his violence in which there are not presumptive proofs of corruption. These practices are so intimately blended with each other, that we thought the distribution which we have adopted would best bring before you the spirit and genius of his government; and we were convinced, that, if upon these four great heads of charge your Lordships should not find him guilty, nothing could be added to them which would persuade you so to do.|$|E

40|$|In Dutch law {{there is}} no overall {{criminal}} offence on corruption. In Dutch criminal law corruption is divided in specific criminal offences which all have their own specific definition. Most corruption can be qualified as a criminal offence but it is sometimes difficult to qualify them as such. Qualifying in general as an offence is easy (forgery for example) but proving that the act specifically qualifies as corruption is harder. Given this general observation, a specific form of <b>active</b> <b>corruption</b> in the Dutch Criminal Code (DCC) seems relevant regarding to art. 2, par. 1, section a of the Framework Decision 2003 / 568 /JHA of 22 July 2003 on combatting corruption in the private sector. Art. 328 ter par. 2 of the DCC deals with bribery of a private person: punishable is the private person that gives or offers someone other than a civil servant, working in employement or acting as an agent, in exchange for something he has done or not done or will do or refrain from doing {{in the performance of}} his burden, a gift or promise, or a service of that nature or under such circumstances that he should reasonable assume that such a gift or promise will be withheld from his employer or principal contrary to good faith. This provision covers <b>active</b> <b>corruption</b> on the initiative of all private persons, including employees, managers and directors of private entities. However, this provision is limited to the bribery of employees and managers and seems to exclude the bribery of a director of a private entity. This means that this provision does not fully cover the obligation under art. 2, par. 1, section a of the Framework Decision 2003 / 568 /JHA. In addition to art. 328 ter DCC more general provisions can be used, especcially when the <b>active</b> <b>corruption</b> involves bribery of a director of a private entity. Dependant upon the circumstances of the case the provisions on forgery, falsifying of documents and cheating could be relevant. These circumstances should then involve: the forgery of a written statement with the intention to use this statement as genuine (art. 225 DCC), the falsification of stock certificates or other official certificates or documents, (art. 226 DCC) or the elements of cheating. In art. 326 of the DCC cheating is described as: the person who intentionally favours himself or another person in a unlawfull way, by using a false name, a false capacity, cunning manouvres or fabrications, moving another person to hand over a good, a service, information or a debt...|$|E

40|$|Corruption in {{business}} occurs {{in situations of}} {{a quid pro quo}} relationship between public officials and business managers representing corporations. Many a time, such corrupt situations can harm stakeholder interests. Managers, as decision-makers, in corruption-related situations may fail to understand the impact of their decisions in such situation for they operate from a position of "position-dependent objectivity" (Sen, 2002) focusing on economic objectives usually. They may fail to understand that their involvement in corrupt acts can lead to violation of fundamental stakeholder issues such as human rights as in the cases of Shell and Enron (discussed in this thesis). The thesis examines the meaning of corruption in relation to its stakeholder impact and proposes that corporate good governance in corruption-related situations is a matter of ethical decision-making, exceeding legal compliance. It explores the decision-making factors that operate within an individual manager while dealing with corruption-related situations {{in business}} and maps an analytical mental model of a decision-making manager in such situations. The thesis proposes 'Corruption-related Decision-making' (CRDM) as an orderly way of thinking for managers to deal with corruption-related situations in business. The CRDM concept is demonstrated {{through the use of a}} new Corruption-related Decision-making model that protects human rights, environmental issues, sustainable development and any other relevant stakeholder issue that one may wish to include. The relevance of the CRDM concept and the model was evaluated in a survey of forty-one multinational companies from Mumbai, India. The survey confirmed that none of the respondents used any decision-making tools while dealing with corruption-related situations. The survey revealed that 40 out of 41 companies experienced rent-seeking behaviour (bribes demanded) in India. Out of these 41 companies, 26 companies 'usually' lost business due to non-compliance with bribe demands and another 9 companies lost business 'sometimes. ' The survey also explored the role of 'fear of loss of business' in the decision-making process and found that 'fear of loss of business' led decision-makers change stance from a state of passive corruption (facing demand) to a position of <b>active</b> <b>corruption</b> (making an offer), with 27 companies actually moving from a position of passive corruption to <b>active</b> <b>corruption.</b> All 41 companies, without a single exception, believed (when asked) that corruption can adversely affect stakeholder issues such as human rights. The survey findings confirm the relevance of the CRDM model as a decision-making tool and as a good practice document in corruption-related situations. The CRDM model can motivate an internal review of a manager's persona with a reminder that ethical decision-making and protection of stakeholder rights is possible in corruption-related situations. The concept of CRDM is a potential contribution in dealing with the illegitimate, the illegal and the oppressive aspects of international business...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Secure {{function}} evaluation (SFE) {{allows a}} set of players to compute an arbitrary agreed function of their private inputs, even if an adversary may corrupt some of the players. Secure multi-party computation (MPC) is a generalization allowing to perform an arbitrary on-going (also called reactive or stateful) computation during which players can receive outputs and provide new inputs at intermediate stages. At Crypto 2006, Ishai et al. considered mixed threshold adversaries that either passively corrupt some fixed number of players, or, alternatively, actively corrupt some (smaller) fixed number of players, and showed that for certain thresholds, cryptographic SFE is possible, whereas cryptographic MPC is not. However, this separation does not occur when one considers perfect security. Actually, past work suggests that no such separation exists, as all known general protocols for perfectly secure SFE {{can also be used}} for MPC. Also, such a separation does not show up with general adversaries, characterized by a collection of corruptible subsets of the players, when considering passive and <b>active</b> <b>corruption.</b> In this paper, we study the most general corruption model where the adversary is characterized by a collection of adversary classes, each specifying the subset of players that can be actively, passively, or fail-corrupted, respectively, and show that in this model, perfectly secure MPC separates from perfectly secure SFE. Furthermore, we derive the exact conditions on the adversary structure for the existence of perfectly secure SFE resp. MPC, and provide efficient protocols for both cases. ...|$|E
25|$|Shevardnadze's {{rapid rise}} in Soviet Georgia's {{political}} hierarchy {{was the result}} of his campaign against corruption. Throughout most of Shevardnadze's leadership, anti-corruption campaigns were central to his authority and policy. By the time Shevardnadze had become leader, Georgia was the Soviet republic most afflicted by corruption. The rule of Vasil Mzhavanadze had been characterised by weak leadership, nepotism, despotism, and bribery pervading the upper echelons of power. In Georgia, corruption had been allowed to thrive, leading to serious deformations in the system; for example only 68 per cent of Georgian goods were exported legally, while the percentage of goods exported legally from other Soviet Republics approached 100 per cent. Shevardnadze rallied support for his anti-corruption campaigns by establishing the Study of Public Opinion. To combat corruption, he engaged in subterfuge; after halting all exports he dressed himself as a peasant and drove a car filled with tomatoes through the border. After his personal subterfuge, the entire Georgian border police was purged. While never proven, it is said that after taking office, Shevardnadze asked all leading officials to show their left hands and ordered those who used Western-produced watches to replace them with Soviet ones. This story portrayed Shevardnadze as an <b>active</b> battler against <b>corruption.</b> His campaign against corruption was largely unsuccessful and when he returned to Georgia in 1992, corruption was still a huge problem.|$|R

The dissertation also considers the role of cross-border criminal groups who, in effect, operate transnationally. However, they are only considered within a domestic framework. This trafficking sociology has placed limitations on the ability of the international community to combat the trade. The borderlands environment makes it problematic to combat trafficking. Some groups operating in the borderlands have built substantial wealth upon the smuggling and trafficking of goods, including people. Central control is also weaker with provincial authorities and military officials operating fiefdoms in lucrative border provinces. The complex interplay of patronage networks, illicit border industries and accelerating economic development in border provinces has created a climate well suited to the trafficking of people into the local sex industries. As a way to understand this problem, the dissertation proposes the widening of the definition and understanding of transnational organised crime groups to include low order and high order transnational crime groups differentiating between high order groups such as the Russian Mafiya, and low order groups such as Cambodian crossborder criminals trading Vietnamese women in Thailand. This dissertation examines the groups operating in the borderlands, the dynamics behind the trade, and the regional influences facilitating the growth of this illicit trade...|$|R
