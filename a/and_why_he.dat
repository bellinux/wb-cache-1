Rowley told Wallace that the Union army had retreated, Sherman was no longer fighting at Shiloh Church, and the battle line had moved northeast toward Pittsburg Landing. If Wallace continued in the same direction, he would have {{found himself in the}} rear of the advancing Confederate troops.|$|E

He suspected that Lady Zhen had probably committed an offence, which was not recorded in the official histories of the Cao Wei state.|$|E

25|$|It is {{generally}} agreed amongst critics {{that the differences}} between these two passages represents authorial revision as opposed to faulty reporting, leading one {{to ask the question}} of why Shakespeare removed the references to Salisbury, <b>and</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> wrote the preceding lines where Warwick re-introduces Montague as his brother.

Some Indian analysts have speculated that David Headley was a double agent for the Central Intelligence Agency that had infiltrated LeT, an accusation denied by the CIA. As soon as Headley was arrested in Chicago, the Indian media had a barrage of questions for the government about him, whose answers were slow in coming.|$|E
