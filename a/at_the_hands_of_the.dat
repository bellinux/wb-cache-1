However, while Heffron's movement was based on his personal stronghold in his BotanyMaroubra ALP branches and the left-wing trade unions, Lang maintained majority control of the caucus, party machine and the party newspaper, Labor Daily.|$|E
5|$|An {{articulate}} {{expression of}} Greek republicanism {{can be found}} in the works of the revolutionary author Rigas Feraios. Feraios' execution in 1798 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ottomans gave an aura of heroism to these political ideas, which also visualized the liberation of Greece in the context of political reforms. In addition to Feraios' writings, other works in the same polemical style took on a sharper revolutionary character, as social contradictions in the Ottoman Empire grew.|$|E

5|$|In The Ancient Entrenchments and Camps of Gloucestershire, Edward J. Burrow {{mentions}} that probably either the Goidel or Brython people initially built Worlebury Camp.

5|$|Initially, the Brabant Revolution {{was also}} able to {{continue}} unthreatened {{because of the lack}} of external opposition. Soon after the revolution started, Joseph II had fallen ill. Following its defeats <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patriot army in the initial campaign, the only Austrian force in the region, taking refuge in Luxembourg, could not challenge the rebels alone. The ongoing conflict with the Ottoman Empire also meant that the bulk of Austria's own army could not be spared to put down the rebellion.|$|E

5|$|The devastation in Dobrudzha <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Magyars {{indicated}} {{how vulnerable}} Bulgaria was to attacks {{from the north}} {{under the influence of}} the Byzantine diplomacy. That experience paid off well in 917, when Simeon managed to counter the Byzantine efforts to ally with the Serbs or the Pechenegs, and forced them to fight alone in the battle of Achelous, where the Byzantines were soundly defeated in one of the biggest disasters in Byzantine history.|$|E
5|$|The {{execution}} of an Anglo-Saxon king on {{the orders of}} another ruler was very rare, although public hanging and beheading did occur at this time, as has been discovered at the Sutton Hoo site. Æthelberht's death <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mercians made the possibility of any peaceful union between the Anglian peoples (including Mercia) less likely than before. It led to Mercia's domination of East Anglia, whose kings ruled over the kingdom for over three decades after Æthelberht's death.|$|E
5|$|Vincent DiStephano was not {{included}} in the original screenplay for Alien: Resurrection, but director Jean-Pierre Jeunet admired Cruz' previous work and had casting director Rick Pagano arrange a meeting. DiStephano was added to the cast as the remaining soldier and guide for the band of survivors. In Alien Zone II: The Spaces of Science-fiction Cinema, Annette Kuhn calls DiStephano's death <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Newborn a perverse joke because of its juxtaposition of infantile features and curiosity with gruesome killing.|$|E

5|$|A Warrior Who Fought Custer was {{published}} in April 1931 to mostly good reviews. However, W. J. Ghent, writing in the New York Times, criticized the claim made by Wooden Leg that many of Custer's men had committed suicide rather than face death <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indians. Although sales of the Wooden Leg book did well, better than Marquis had expected, this controversy was to prove a hindrance to his chances of future book publications. Marquis believed he had multiple Indian sources verifying this account, {{and there were no}} surviving whites to contradict it. He planned to develop the idea more fully in a future book, eventually to become Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself.|$|E
5|$|According to Pat Southern, principes {{appear to}} have been born from {{remnants}} of the old second class of the army under the Etruscan kings when it was reformed by Marcus Furius Camillus. The second class stood in some of the first few ranks of a very large phalanx and were equipped in a similar manner to principes. They would support the heavier first class in the front ranks. It is probable that engagements with the Samnites and a crushing defeat <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gallic warlord Brennus, who both used lots of smaller military units rather than a few very large ones, taught the Romans the importance of flexibility and the inadequacy of the phalanx on the rough, hilly ground of central Italy.|$|E
