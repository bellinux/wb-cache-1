5|$|Below <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the {{striatum}} are {{a number}} of basal forebrain structures. These include the nucleus accumbens, nucleus basalis, diagonal band of Broca, substantia innominata, and the medial septal nucleus. These structures are important in producing the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, which is then distributed widely throughout the brain. The basal forebrain, in particular the nucleus basalis, is considered to be the major cholinergic output of the central nervous system to the striatum and neocortex.|$|E
5|$|Blackburn Rovers {{also started}} their {{campaign}} in the first round, where they won their first game at home against Southport Central 7–1. The second round saw them drawn away to South Shore at Blackpool resulting in a further victory {{by a margin of}} 7–0.

5|$|Both Hougoumont and Papelotte were {{fortified}} and garrisoned, {{and thus}} anchored Wellington's flanks securely. Papelotte also commanded {{the road to}} Wavre that the Prussians would use to send reinforcements to Wellington's position. On {{the western side of}} the main road, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the rest of Wellington's line, was the farmhouse and orchard of La Haye Sainte, which was garrisoned with 400 light infantry of the King's German Legion. On {{the opposite side of the}} road was a disused sand quarry, where the 95th Rifles were posted as sharpshooters.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln, Old Bob was again brought out of retirement. During the cortège preceding the funeral in Springfield, Old Bob was caparisoned in a black mourning blanket trimmed with silver fringe and tassels. Henry Brown, an African Methodist Episcopal minister and friend of the Lincoln family, led Old Bob, whose spot in the procession was immediately behind the hearse <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the carriage carrying Robert Todd Lincoln.

5|$|In June and July 2002, Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma {{sponsored}} the first National Intercollegiate Marching Band, which {{traveled to the}} French Riviera, including the cities of Nice, Grasse, Aix-en-Provence, Cannes, Antibes, and the Principality of Monaco. The thirty-five member band performed at Le Suquet in Cannes, in Nice, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the Prince's Palace of Monaco. After the inaugural trip, the program was dissolved by the joint national councils due to its high cost and low attendance, which {{was believed to be}} caused by a fear of traveling abroad after the September 11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|In {{this type}} of legion, the 900 principes formed 15 maniples, {{military}} units of 60 men each.

In a pitched battle, the leves, javelin armed light infantry would form up {{at the front of}} the legion and harass the enemy with javelin fire to cover the advance of the hastati, light spearmen.|$|E

The triarii stood in the third line of the legion, behind the front line of hastati and the second line of principes, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the rorarii and accensi. In a pitched battle, the leves, javelin-armed skirmishers who were attached to maniples of hastati, would form up {{at the front of the}} legion and harass the enemy with javelin fire and cover the advance of the hastati, spear armed infantry.|$|E
5|$|South of the loggia is the Dutch Tea Garden, {{which was}} laid out by C.E.Mallows in about 1905. The garden {{contains}} the Tea House which was designed by John Douglas. This has a cruciform plan and is a half-timbered building on a sandstone plinth. The roof is of red tiles, and sweeps upwards to a small spire surmounted by a weathercock. It is listed at GradeII. In {{the centre of the}} garden is a statue of Mercury <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the Tea House are two stone Talbots. To the north of the Tea House, on the path leading to the Broad Walk, is a pair of wrought iron gates made in 1913 for the 2ndDuke. The gates and their overthrow are listed at GradeII.|$|E
5|$|Stephenson {{built the}} {{locomotive}} originally as an 0-4-0 (an 0-4-0 is the Whyte notation for a steam locomotive with two powered axles and no unpowered leading or trailing axles). The locomotive's power was {{transmitted to the}} driving axles through pistons that were mounted under the boiler between the two front wheels <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the front axle. These inside cylinders' main rods were connected to a rear crank axle with a connecting rod between the two axles to power the front axle.|$|E

5|$|The Point {{was formed}} by {{longshore}} drift and this movement continues westward; the spit lengthened by 132.1m (433ft) between 1886 and 1925. At the western end, the shingle curves south towards the mainland. This feature has developed several times over the years, giving the impression from {{the air of a}} series of hooks along {{the south side of the}} spit. Salt marshes have formed between the shingle curves <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the coasts sheltered by the spit, and sand dunes have accumulated at the Point's western end. Some of the shorter side ridges meet the main ridge at a steep angle due to the southward movement of the latter. There is an area of reclaimed farmland, known as Blakeney Freshes, to the west of Cley Beach Road.|$|E
5|$|The Torah ark had the {{capacity}} to house 50 Torah scrolls and was built on two levels. It was flanked by four Corinthian columns surrounded by baroque woodcuts depicting flowers and birds. The Ark, together with its ornamental gates, were taken from the Nikolayevsky Synagogue in Kherson, Russia, which had been used by Russian Jewish conscripts forced to spend twenty-five years in the Imperial Russian Army. Directly above the Ark was a triangular window with rounded points. To the right <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the ark was the cantor's podium, which was designed as a miniature version of the two-level Ark.|$|E
5|$|The {{reflector}} sight mechanism {{was mounted}} {{in front of}} the gyro, slightly to the left. A metal flap protected the half-mirror from damage when stowed, which was rotated rearward during use, covering the spirit level. The collimator was mounted on a prominent arm that projected above <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the sight when in use, and folded forward when stored. Electrical power was provided to light the collimator as well as the drift scale, which indicated the angle to fly to correct for the wind drift.|$|E

5|$|The skull {{had a pair}} of horns above <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the eyes. These horns were {{composed}} of extensions of the lacrimal bones, and varied in shape and size. There were also lower paired ridges running along the top edges of the nasal bones that led into the horns. The horns were probably covered in a keratin sheath and may have had a variety of functions, including acting as sunshades for the eye, being used for display, and being used in combat against other members of the same species (although they were fragile). There was a ridge along the back of the skull roof for muscle attachment, as is also seen in tyrannosaurids.|$|E
5|$|The upper {{esophagus}} lies at {{the back}} of the mediastinum behind the trachea, adjoining along the tracheoesophageal stripe, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the erector spinae muscles and the vertebral column. The lower esophagus lies behind the heart and curves in front of the thoracic aorta. From the bifurcation of the trachea downwards, the esophagus passes behind the right pulmonary artery, left main bronchus, and left atrium. At this point it passes through the diaphragm.|$|E

Alabama reached the end zone late in the second on a nine-yard Greg McElroy pass to Julio Jones to make the halftime score 21–9 after the extra point failed.|$|E
