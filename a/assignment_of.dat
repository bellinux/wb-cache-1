The purpose is to assess structure <b>of</b> <b>assignment</b> plan <b>of</b> engineering series equipment. An assessment method <b>of</b> structure <b>of</b> <b>assignment</b> plan <b>of</b> engineering series equipment based on value judgment is put forward. Relative index systems and assessment models are established. The assessment method can offer a typical example to the assessment <b>of</b> other analogous <b>assignment</b> plan <b>of</b> equipment...|$|R

5|$|The Ayyubids {{had three}} {{principal}} means of recruiting the educated elites whom {{they needed to}} administer their cities and towns. Some of these local leaders, known as shaykhs, entered the service of an Ayyubid ruling household and thus their bids for power were supported from Ayyubid household revenues and influence. Others were paid directly out of revenues made from the diwan, a high governmental body of the state. The third method was assignment to the shaykhs of the revenues of charitable endowments, known as waqfs. The Ayyubids, like their various predecessors in the region, had relatively few state agencies by which they could penetrate their cities and towns. To link themselves with the educated elite of their cities, they relied on the political usage of patronage practices. The <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> waqf revenue to this elite {{was similar to the}} <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> fiefs (iqta'at) to the commanders and generals of the army. In both cases, it enabled the Ayyubids to recruit a dependent, but not administratively subordinate elite.|$|E

5|$|A {{cellular}} automaton {{consists of an}} array of cells, each one of which has {{a finite number of}} possible states, together with a rule for updating all cells simultaneously based only on the states of neighboring cells. A configuration of a {{cellular automaton}} is an <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> a state to every cell of the automaton; the update rule of a cellular automaton forms a function from configurations to configurations, with the requirement that the updated value of any cell depends only on some finite neighborhood of the cell, and that the function is invariant under translations of the input array.|$|E

5|$|A k-coloring, {{for some}} integer k, is an <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> one of k colors to each vertex of a graph G {{such that the}} {{endpoints}} of each edge get different colors. The k-colorings of G correspond exactly to homomorphisms from G to the complete graph K'k. Indeed, the vertices of K'k correspond to the k colors, and two colors are adjacent as vertices of K'k if {{and if they are}} different. Hence a function defines a homomorphism to K'k if and only if it maps adjacent vertices of G to different colors (i.e., it is a k-coloring). In particular, G is k-colorable if and only if it is K'k-colorable.|$|E
5|$|An {{infinite}} loop may occur if the exit {{conditions for the}} loop are not defined correctly. Once L exceeds R, the search has failed and must convey {{the failure of the}} search. In addition, the loop must be exited when the target element is found, {{or in the case of}} an implementation where this check is moved to the end, checks for whether the search was successful or failed at the end must be in place. Bentley found that, in his <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> binary search, most of the programmers who implemented binary search incorrectly made an error defining the exit conditions.|$|E

On February 3, 1952, Loring was reassigned to the 2353rd Personnel Processing Squadron at Camp Stoneman in Pittsburg, California. This unit was quickly moved to South Korea, where it was assigned to the 8th Fighter-Bomber Wing, Fifth Air Force, with the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> supervising training for replacement pilots before they were moved into combat units. During this time he flew with the 36th Fighter-Bomber Squadron and 80th Fighter-Bomber Squadron, while assisting the new pilots.|$|E

Methyl C-z-exchange experiments were designed to provide convenient access to PCS measurements in situations where a paramagnetic lanthanide is in exchange with a diamagnetic lanthanide. In the absence of exchange, simultaneous C- 13 -HSQC assignments and PCS measurements are delivered by the newly developed program Possum. The approaches are demonstrated with the complex between the N-terminal domain of the subunit epsilon and the subunit theta of the Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III...|$|R

5|$|In 1999, Rosendo Pascual {{and colleagues}} {{described}} a jaw of Sudamerica. Because {{some of this}} jaw's features {{were thought to be}} incompatible with a multituberculate identity, they regarded gondwanatheres (including Ferugliotherium) as Mammalia incertae sedis. However, in 2009 Yamila Gurovich and Robin Beck argued in favor of a close relationship between gondwanatheres (including Ferugliotherium) and multituberculates. The controversy is partially due to disagreement over the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> two upper premolars and the jaw fragment described by Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte in 1996; Gurovich and Beck identify these as Ferugliotherium, while Kielan-Jaworowska and others regard them as indeterminate multituberculates.|$|E
