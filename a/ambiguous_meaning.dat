25|$|Filipino has the {{following}} composite characters: á, à, â, é, è, ê, í, ì, î, ó, ò, ô, ú, ù, û. The actual use of diacritics for Filipino, however, is rare, and is meant only {{to distinguish between}} homonyms with different stresses and meanings that either occur near {{each other in a}} text or to aid the reader in ascertaining its otherwise <b>ambiguous</b> <b>meaning.</b> Sometimes appears in Spanish loanwords and names if Spanish orthography is observed.|$|E
25|$|These {{explanations}} {{come from}} the <b>ambiguous</b> <b>meaning</b> of the word 'week' in Hebrew, which means 'a heptad', {{or a group of}} seven. The Hebrew word for 'week' is used to refer to periods of seven days as well as seven years. The understanding of this number as referring to 490 years can also be found in Seder Olam. Christians also interpreted these verses as years and connect them to Jesus, although Rashi's interpretation is such that it upholds the tradition that the anointed one in question is the Persian king Cyrus.|$|E
500|$|Steiner {{responded to}} {{criticism}} that Hitler's {{speech in the}} book is unchallenged by saying that it had been done before: for example Satan's speech in Milton's Paradise Lost (1667), and The Grand Inquisitor's speech in Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov (1880). He also reminded the reader that Hitler's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber's long monologue on the horrors of the Holocaust. Finally, Steiner said that his Hitler (A.H.) is [...] "a fictive figure", and that it is not he who has the last word, but Teku, the Indian tracker, who shouts [...] "Proven". Dominick LaCapra said that Teku's declaration is <b>ambiguous,</b> <b>meaning</b> either Hitler has proved his innocence or his guilt. Steiner explained this ambiguity by adding that Teku is the Hebrew word used to indicate that [...] "there are issues here beyond our wisdom to answer or decide." ...|$|E
5000|$|The names Ish-bosheth and Eshbaal have <b>ambiguous</b> <b>meanings</b> in the {{original}} Hebrew. In Hebrew, Ish-bosheth means [...] "Man of shame." [...] He is also called Eshbaal, in Hebrew meaning [...] "Baal exists." ...|$|R

500|$|... "Animal" [...] {{was written}} by Miike Snow's three members, Christian Karlsson, Pontus Winnberg and Andrew Wyatt, in {{collaboration}} with Henrik Jonback. In an interview with Dustin Fitzharris of Out, Wyatt explained that the song has an <b>ambiguous</b> <b>meaning,</b> [...] "It can deal with addiction. It can deal with just the basic instincts – {{some of them are}} wonderful {{and some of them are}} very dangerous." [...] In a separate interview with Joe Zadeh for Clash, Wyatt deemed it a [...] "very simple song" [...] and elaborated on its subject matter, [...] "Directing your attention to man's underlying nature and how sometimes things in society just don't work out to meet your needs. And a lot of people end up feeling very dissatisfied. And the way people feel the need to fit into certain circumstances without even thinking about what they want." [...] "Animal" [...] was recorded at Robotberget, the band's own studio in Stockholm, Sweden. The band produced the track and then mixed it with Anders Hvenare.|$|E
2500|$|The name Visperad is a {{contraction}} of Avestan vispe ratavo, with an <b>ambiguous</b> <b>meaning.</b> Subject to how ratu is translated, vispe ratavo [...] may be translated as [...] "(prayer to) all patrons" [...] or [...] "all masters" [...] or the older and today less common [...] "all chiefs." [...] or [...] "all lords." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early {{capacitors}} {{were known}} as condensers, a term that is still occasionally used today, particularly in high power applications, such as automotive systems. The term was first {{used for this purpose}} by Alessandro Volta in 1782, with reference to the device's ability to store a higher density of electric charge than was possible with an isolated conductor. [...] The term became deprecated because of the <b>ambiguous</b> <b>meaning</b> of steam condenser, with capacitor becoming the recommended term from 1926.|$|E

5000|$|As a Jungian {{teacher and}} practitioner, Edwards {{influenced}} {{the field of}} art therapy internationally to appreciate the potential of symbols and images to carry multiple and <b>ambiguous</b> <b>meanings.</b> He taught that approaching a painting or a drawing {{as if it were}} [...] "independent and semi-autonomous" [...] would amplify rather than reduce its meanings and allow imaginative dialogue, to the end of deepening understanding of the art for both the patient and the therapist.|$|R
2500|$|The term [...] "satanic ritual abuse" [...] {{is used to}} {{describe}} different behaviors, actions and allegations that lie between extremes of definitions. In 1988, a nationwide study of sexual abuse in U.S. day care agencies, led by David Finkelhor, divided [...] "ritual abuse" [...] allegations into three categories—cult-based ritualism in which the abuse had a spiritual or social goal for the perpetrators, pseudo-ritualism in which the goal was sexual gratification and the rituals were used to frighten or intimidate victims, and psychopathological ritualism in which the rituals were due to mental disorders. Subsequent investigators have expanded on these definitions and also pointed to a fourth alleged type of Satanic ritual abuse, in which petty crimes with <b>ambiguous</b> <b>meaning</b> (such as graffiti or vandalism) generally committed by teenagers were attributed to the actions of Satanic cults.|$|E
2500|$|Since the 1960s, French Canadians in Quebec have {{generally}} used Québécois (masculine) or Québécoise (feminine) {{to express their}} cultural and national identity, rather than Canadien français and Canadienne française. Francophones who self-identify as Québécois {{and do not have}} French-Canadian ancestry may not identify as [...] "French Canadian" [...] (Canadien or Canadien français). Those who do have French or French-Canadian ancestry, but who support Quebec sovereignty, often find Canadien français to be archaic or even pejorative. This {{is a reflection of the}} strong social, cultural, and political ties that most Quebeckers of French-Canadian origin, who constitute a majority of francophone Quebecers, maintain within Quebec. It has given Québécois an <b>ambiguous</b> <b>meaning</b> which has often played out in political issues, as all public institutions attached to the Government of Quebec refer to all Quebec citizens, regardless of their language or their cultural heritage, as Québécois.|$|E
2500|$|In South Korea, Hanja {{are used}} most {{frequently}} in ancient literature, legal documents, and scholarly monographs, where they often appear without the equivalent Hangul spelling. [...] Usually, only those words with a specialized or <b>ambiguous</b> <b>meaning</b> are printed in Hanja. [...] In mass-circulation books and magazines, Hanja are generally used rarely, and only to gloss words already spelled in Hangul when the meaning is ambiguous. Hanja are also {{often used in}} newspaper headlines as abbreviations or to eliminate ambiguity. In formal publications, personal names are also usually glossed in Hanja in parentheses next to the Hangul. In contrast, North Korea eliminated the use of Hanja even in academic publications by 1949, a situation that has since remained unchanged. Hanja are often used for advertising or decorative purposes, and appear frequently in athletic events and cultural parades, dictionaries and atlases. [...] For example, the Hanja [...] (sin or shin, meaning sour or hot) appears prominently on packages of Shin Ramyun noodles.|$|E
5000|$|Rainy Sky SA {{and others}} v Kookmin Bank [...] is an English {{contract}} law case concerning interpretation of contracts. The Supreme Court confirmed the principle {{laid down in}} Wickman v Schuler that, if {{the words of a}} contract have <b>ambiguous</b> <b>meanings,</b> the court will interpret it in a manner that most accords with [...] "business common sense". There is no requirement for a party to prove that the alternative interpretation is entirely unreasonable.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the centuries, Gaels and Gaelic-speakers {{have been}} known {{by a number of}} names. The most {{consistent}} of these have been Gael, Irish and Scots. The latter two have developed more <b>ambiguous</b> <b>meanings,</b> due to the early modern concept of the nation state, which encompasses non-Gaels. Other terms, such as Milesian, are not often used. An Old Norse name for the Gaels was Vestmenn ("Westmen"). Informally, archetypal forenames such as Tadhg or Dòmhnall are sometimes used for Gaels.|$|R
5000|$|Brought {{to trial}} means to {{calendar}} a legal {{case for a}} hearing, or to bring a defendant to the bar of justice. The simplest definition is [...] "the commencement of the trial in a court by formally calling and [...] of the witnesses to initiate the trial proceedings." [...] However, much like pro rata, it has several different, <b>ambiguous</b> <b>meanings</b> and examples used in the law. To bring to trial is when the process is ongoing.|$|R
60|$|Gabriel {{consented to}} sit; he professed he should enjoy {{it and be}} glad to give up for it his {{immediate}} foreign commerce, so vague to Nick, so definite apparently to himself; {{and he came back}} three times for the purpose. Nick promised himself a deal of interest from this experiment, for with the first hour of it he began to feel that really as yet, given the conditions under which he now studied him, he had never at all thoroughly explored his friend. His impression had been that Nash had a head quite fine enough to be a challenge, and that as he sat there day by day all sorts of pleasant and paintable things would come out in his face. This impression was not gainsaid, but the whole tangle grew denser. It struck our young man that he had never seen his subject before, and yet somehow this revelation was not produced by the sense of actually seeing it. What was revealed was the difficulty--what he saw was not the measurable mask but the <b>ambiguous</b> <b>meaning.</b> He had taken things for granted which literally were not there, and he found things there--except that he couldn't catch them--which he had not hitherto counted in or presumed to handle. This baffling effect, eminently in the line of the mystifying, so familiar to Nash, might have been the result of his whimsical volition, had it not appeared to our artist, after a few hours of the job, that his sitter was not the one who enjoyed it most. He was uncomfortable, at first vaguely and then definitely so--silent, restless, gloomy, dim, as if on the test the homage of a directer attention than he had ever had gave him less pleasure than he would have supposed. He had been willing to judge of this in good faith; but frankly he rather suffered. He wasn't cross, but was clearly unhappy, and Nick had never before felt him contract instead of expanding.|$|E

50|$|The Treaties of Tientsin uses several {{words that}} have {{somewhat}} <b>ambiguous</b> <b>meanings.</b> For example, the words “settlement” and “concession” {{can often be}} confused. The term “settlement” refers to a parcel of land leased to a foreign power and is composed of both foreign and national peoples; locally elected foreigners govern them. The term “concession” refers to a long-term lease of land to a foreign power where the foreign nation has complete control of the land; it is governed by consular representation.|$|R
50|$|Some lexicographers {{claim that}} no {{synonyms}} have {{exactly the same}} meaning (in all contexts or social levels of language) because etymology, orthography, phonic qualities, <b>ambiguous</b> <b>meanings,</b> usage, etc. make them unique. Different words that are similar in meaning usually differ for a reason: feline is more formal than cat; long and extended are only synonyms in one usage and not in others (for example, a long arm {{is not the same}} as an extended arm). Synonyms are also a source of euphemisms.|$|R

30|$|Before {{moving on}} to other methodological differences, {{it should be noted}} here that even the {{presentation}} duration of the visual targets can modulate the contextual effects observed (Ahrens 1998, 2006). When the presentation duration was shorter than 1000 milliseconds (for example, 300 milliseconds in Ahrens 1998, and 300 and 750 milliseconds in Ahrens 2006), exhaustive access of <b>ambiguous</b> <b>meanings</b> has been observed. When the visual stimuli were presented for 1500 milliseconds (Ahrens 2006), selective access has been observed. This information, however, has rarely been provided in previous reports.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{precisely how}} objects assume meanings in archaeological interpretation and {{a dimension of}} everyday life and experience that exists {{on the fringes of}} self-consciousness. Archaeologists interpret the meanings of material things in ways that have often sought to erase the ambiguities of material symbolism in conventional linear narratives, but oral memories routinely struggle with the meaning of things and underscore their complex and <b>ambiguous</b> <b>meanings.</b> The paper examines how the contributors to this volume illuminate the implications of oral memories on broader material culture scholarship both within and beyond historical archaeology...|$|R
50|$|While poetaster {{has always}} been a {{negative}} appraisal of a poet's skills, rhymester (or rhymer) and versifier have held <b>ambiguous</b> <b>meanings</b> depending on the commentator’s opinion of a writer's verse. Versifier is often used to refer to someone who produces work in verse with the implication that while technically able to make lines rhyme they have no real talent for poetry. Rhymer on the other hand is usually impolite despite attempts to salvage the reputation of rhymers such as the Rhymers' Club and Rhymer being a common last name.|$|R
