5|$|A {{least one}} {{transportation}} {{study in the}} early 1970s identified the highway north of Novi as M-275. The Oakland County Road Commission, local land developers, and local politicians supported building a highway along the route of M-275 {{to open up the}} area for development. After the January 1977 cancelation of M-275 as a full freeway, the state explored building the highway as a parkway instead. This parkway concept allowed at-grade intersections that would have not been permitted had the highway been built as a full freeway, and included more landscaping and less grade separation. In September 1977, the State Transportation Commission ordered MDOT to study alternatives to a freeway in the area, along with the possible widening of I-94 and US23 and the improvement of local roads to handle increased traffic caused by the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extended I-275 from the state's freeway network.|$|E
5|$|After this, the Allied forces {{advanced}} to the fortified naval outpost of Tobruk. The 6th Division attacked the perimeter defences early on 21 January, following a week of continuous bombardment from both land and sea. The 2/3rd Battalion was tasked with breaching the outer Italian defences for the 2/1st Battalion to pass through. Following the initial breakthrough, the 2/3rd then advanced west along the inner ring of defences, attacking a number of Italian posts as they went. Tobruk fell the next day, with the Italians surrendering to Brigadier Horace Robertson, {{the commander of the}} 19th Brigade. The Italian flag was taken down and in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Australian flag, a signaler from the 2/4th Battalion tied his slouch hat to the flag staff and hauled it up to the top.

5|$|Even in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impact, {{significant}} acceleration or deceleration of {{the head}} can cause TBI; however in most cases a combination of impact and acceleration is probably to blame. Forces involving the head striking or being struck by something, termed contact or impact loading, are the cause of most focal injuries, and movement of the brain within the skull, termed noncontact or inertial loading, usually causes diffuse injuries. The violent shaking of an infant that causes shaken baby syndrome commonly manifests as diffuse injury. In impact loading, the force sends shock waves through the skull and brain, resulting in tissue damage. Shock waves caused by penetrating injuries can also destroy tissue along {{the path of a}} projectile, compounding the damage caused by the missile itself.|$|E

He was re-elected in the March 1957 elections, in which the UDSG also placed first, winning 18 of the 40 contested seats, against 16 for BDG. M'ba's party won 21 seats against 19 for Aubame's party after a recount. However, in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> absolute majority, on 21 May 1957, both parties were obligated to submit a list of individuals that both agreed were suitable {{for inclusion in the}} government. That same day, M'ba was appointed vice president of the government. Soon, divisions within the government grew, and Aubame resigned from his position and filed a motion of censure against the government. The motion was rejected by a 21–19 vote. With M'ba's victory, many elected UDSG members joined the parliamentary majority, giving the ruling government 29 of the 40 legislative seats. Well installed in the government, he slowly began to reinforce his power.|$|E

5|$|In the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{external}} field, {{the director}} of a liquid crystal is free to point in any direction. It is possible, however, to force the director to point in a specific direction by introducing an outside agent to the system. For example, when a thin polymer coating (usually a polyimide) is spread on a glass substrate and rubbed in a single direction with a cloth, it is observed that liquid crystal molecules in contact with that surface align with the rubbing direction. The currently accepted mechanism for this is believed to be an epitaxial growth of the liquid crystal layers on the partially aligned polymer chains in the near surface layers of the polyimide.|$|E
5|$|Obsessed {{received}} generally negative {{reviews from}} critics, {{many of whom}} were disappointed in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> explanation for Lisa's obsession with Derek. Others noted that the potential theme of interracial conflict between the Charles family, who are black, and Lisa, who is white, was unexplored. The storyline of Obsessed has been compared with that of Fatal Attraction (1987) - a recollection in which Elba and Beyoncé have the Michael Douglas and Anne Archer roles, respectively, while Larter is in Glenn Close's - although film critics disliked the fact that Derek did not yield to Lisa's seduction. The fight scene finale between Sharon and Lisa, however, was commended by reviewers, and won the MTV Movie Award for Best Fight. Obsessed spent its first week atop the US box office, and grossed $73.8million from theaters, internationally. Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the film for home viewing on August4,2009, in the US and has sold 1.3million DVDs, worth $21million of consumer spending.|$|E

40|$|A {{key problem}} faced in many {{diagnostic}} studies is the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single reference standard that can accurately distinguish between patients {{with and without}} the target condition. This problem is commonly referred to as: <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gold standard. In the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gold standard, the classification of the target condition is prone to error. When these classification errors are ignored, {{the evaluation of the}} accuracy of the test(s) under evaluation or the estimation of the prevalence of the target condition can be severely biased. This thesis examines potential solutions that are aimed at alleviating the problems associated with the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gold standard. In particular, we focus on latent class modeling and composite reference standards: two commonly used methods in diagnostic test evaluation literature. There is currently no consensus on how to best address the frequently encountered <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gold standard problem. In this thesis we show that composite reference standards can cause large biases in inferences about diagnostic test accuracy and target condition disease prevalence. It is also shown that latent class analysis should be used with caution. We suggest various approaches to improve latent class analysis by augmenting the diagnostic test data. Future research should be directed at further elucidating the merits and pitfalls of statistical modeling to account for the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gold standard...|$|R
