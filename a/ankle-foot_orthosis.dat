5000|$|An <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>{{orthosis}}</b> (AFO) is an orthosis or brace that encumbers {{the ankle}} and foot. AFOs are externally applied and intended to control position and {{motion of the}} ankle, compensate for weakness, or correct deformities. AFOs {{can be used to}} support weak limbs, or to position a limb with contracted muscles into a more normal position. They are also used to immobilize the ankle and lower leg in the presence of arthritis or fracture, and to correct foot drop; an AFO is also known as a foot-drop brace.Ankle-foot orthoses are the most commonly used orthoses, making up about 26% of all orthoses provided in the United States. According to a review of Medicare payment data from 2001 to 2006, the base cost of an AFO was about $500 to $700. An AFO is generally constructed of lightweight polypropylene-based plastic in the shape of an [...] "L", with the upright portion behind the calf and the lower portion running under the foot.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether community-dwelling chronic stroke patients wearing an <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis</b> would benefit from changing to functional electrical stimulation of the peroneal nerve. METHODS: In 26 community-dwelling chronic (> 6 months post-onset) patients after stroke, their <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis</b> was replaced by a surface-based functional electrical stimulation device (NESS L 300). Comfortable walking speed over 10 m was measured at baseline with the <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis</b> and after 2 and 8 weeks with both <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis</b> and functional electrical stimulation. The level of physical activity was assessed with a pedometer, and patients' satisfaction was assessed with a questionnaire at baseline and at week 8 regarding <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis</b> and functional electrical stimulation, respectively. RESULTS: <b>Ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis</b> and functional electrical stimulation were equally effective with regard to walking speed and activity level. The participants were more satisfied with functional electrical stimulation than with their <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis</b> regarding the effort and stability of walking, quality of the gait pattern, walking distance, comfort of wearing and appearance of the device. CONCLUSION: The patients judged functional electrical stimulation superior to their <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis,</b> but measurements of walking speed and physical activity could not objectify the experienced benefits of functional electrical stimulation. Other outcome measures focusing on the stability and effort of ambulation may objectify the perceived benefits of functional electrical stimulation in community-dwelling chronic stroke patients...|$|E

Aim The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of individually prescribed night <b>ankle–foot</b> <b>orthosis,</b> stretching exercises, and a combined prescription of them on chronic plantar fasciitis. Settings and design This study is a prospective randomized case–control study. Patients and methods Seventy-five patients with unilateral recalcitrant plantar fasciitis were randomized to one of three treatment groups. Group I was treated with stretching exercises to the plantar flexors and plantar fascia. Group II was treated using a night-stretch <b>ankle–foot</b> <b>orthosis.</b> Group III received the same stretching exercises as in group I in combination with night-stretch <b>ankle–foot</b> <b>orthosis</b> as in group II.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ankle-foot orthoses {{could be}} {{utilized}} both {{with and without}} shoes. While several {{studies have shown that}} ankle-foot orthoses improve gait abilities in hemiplegic patients, it remains unclear whether they should be used with shoes or without. OBJECTIVES: The study purpose was to compare the effect of standard shoes and rocker shoes on functional mobility in post-stroke hemiplegic patients utilizing <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis.</b> STUDY DESIGN: Randomized clinical study. METHODS: Thirty post-stroke hemiplegic patients participated in this study randomly assigned to two groups. Group I received standard shoes[*]+[*]ankle-foot orthosis and group II were provided with rocker shoes[*]+[*]ankle-foot orthosis. Their functional mobility and energy expenditure parameters including timed up and go, timed up stairs, timed down stairs, preferred walking speed, and oxygen (O 2) cost (mL/kg/m) were measured. RESULTS: In group I, no significant changes were seen in outcome measures after wearing standard shoes. While in group II, O 2 cost and timed up and go time significantly decreased, and preferred walking speed increased when patients wore rocker shoes. Also, {{there was a significant difference}} between rocker shoes and standard shoes in improvement of timed up and go, preferred walking speed, and O 2 cost. CONCLUSION: When patients using <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis</b> wore rocker shoes, their functional mobility improved and oxygen cost diminished. Also, rocker shoes was significantly more effective than standard shoes in improving functional mobility parameters. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study suggests that in post-stroke hemiplegic patients using <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis,</b> wearing rocker shoes can lead to much more improved functional mobility and decreased energy expenditure compared to <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis</b> only. Thus, in stroke patients, the combination of ankle-foot orthosis-rocker shoes is recommended for both rehabilitation programs and <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis</b> efficacy investigations...|$|E

PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of clinically prescribed floor reaction <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis</b> on kinematic parameters of the hip, knee and ankle in the stance phase of the gait cycle, compared to barefoot walking on children with cerebral palsy. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 2200 patients revealed that 71 patients (142 limbs) had a diagnosis of diplegia, with no contractures in hip, knee or ankle flexion. Their average age was 12. 2 ± 3. 9. All of them were wearing clinically prescribed hinged floor reaction <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis</b> undergoing a three dimensional gait analysis. We divided the patients in three groups: Group I, with limited extension (maximum knee extension less than 15 º); Group II, with moderate limited extension (maximum knee extension between 15 º and 30 º) and Group III Crouch (maximum knee extension in stance more than 30 º). RESULTS: Results indicate the parameters maximum knee extension and ankle dorsiflexion were significant in Group II e III; no change was observed in Group I. The maximum hip extension was not significant in all three groups.

40|$|Background and Purpose. Ankle plantar-flexion contractures are {{a common}} {{complication}} of brain injuries {{and can lead to}} secondary limitations in mobility. Case Description. The patient was a 44 -year-old woman with left hemiplegia following a right frontal arteriovenous malformation resection. She had a left ankle plantar-flexion contrac-ture of 31 degrees from neutral. After a tibial nerve block, an adjustable <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis</b> was applied 23 hours a day for 27 days. Adjustments of the orthosis were made as the contracture was reduced. The patient received physical therapy during the 27 -day period for functional mobility activities and stretching the plantar flexors outside of the orthosis. Outcomes. The patient’s dorsiflexion passive range of motion increased from 31 degrees to 10 degrees. Discussion. The application of an adjustable <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis</b> following a tibial nerve block, as an addition to a physical therapy regimen of stretching and mobility training, may reduce plantar-flexion contractures in patients with brain injury.

40|$|Background: Ankle-foot orthoses {{are known}} to have a {{generally}} positive effect on gait in stroke, however the specifc type of AFO and the time point at which it is provided are highly variable in the currently available literature. Objective: The objective was to determine the immediate spatiotemporal and kinematic effect of custom-made solid ankle–foot orthoses in early stroke rehabilitation, compared to shod walking. Methods: Five male and three female participants were recruited to the study (n = 8), {{with a mean age of}} 57 (16) years who were 3. 5 (3) weeks post-stroke. Each received a custom-made solid <b>ankle–foot</b> <b>orthosis</b> to a predefined set of design criteria and tuned using heel wedges to control the shank inclination angle during shod walking. Repeated spatiotemporal and three-dimensional gait measures were taken pre- and immediately post-intervention. Study design: A pre–post-test experimental study. Results: With the solid <b>ankle–foot</b> <b>orthosis,</b> walking velocity increased from 0. 22 (0. 2) to 0. 36 (0. 3) m/s (p < 0. 05), overall average step length increased from 0. 28 (0. 1) to 0. 37 (0. 1) m (p < 0. 05), cadence increased from 45 (19) to 56 (19) steps/min (p < 0. 05) and step length symmetry ratio increased from 0. 65 (0. 2) to 0. 74 (0. 2) (not significant).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} ankle-foot orthoses on walking efficiency and gait in a heterogeneous group of children with cerebral palsy, using barefoot walking as the control condition. DESIGN: A retrospective study. METHODS: Barefoot and <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis</b> data for 172 children with spastic cerebral palsy (mean age 9 years; hemiplegia: 21, diplegia: 97, and quadriplegia: 54) were compared. These data consisted of non-dimensional speed, net non- dimensional energy cost of walking (NN-cost), and NN-cost as a percentage of speed-matched controls (NN-cost(pct)). For 80 of these children the Gillette Gait Index and data for 3 D gait kinematics and kinetics were also analyzed. RESULTS: Speed was 9 % faster (p < 0. 001), NN-cost was 6 % lower (p= 0. 007), and NN-cost(pct) was 9 % lower (p= 0. 022) when walking with an <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis.</b> The Gillette Gait Index remained unchanged (p= 0. 607). Secondary subgroup analysis for involvement pattern showed a significant improvement in NN-cost(pct) only for quadriplegics (20 %, p= 0. 004), whereas it remained unchanged for patients with hemiplegia and diplegia. Changes in the minimum knee flexion angle in stance phase and in terminal swing were found to be significantly related to the change in NN-cost(pct) (p= 0. 013 and p= 0. 022, respectively).

40|$|BACKGROUND: A reduced {{capacity}} to modify gait {{to the environment}} {{may contribute to the}} risk of falls in people with poststroke foot drop using an <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis.</b> OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to quantify their capacity to restore steady gait after a step modification. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional, observational study. METHODS: Nineteen people in the chronic phase (> 6 months) after stroke (mean age= 55. 0 years, SD= 10. 1) and 20 people of similar age (mean age= 54. 6 years, SD= 12. 0) who were able-bodied were included. Participants were instructed to avoid obstacles that were suddenly released in front of the paretic leg (stroke group) or left leg (control group) while walking on a treadmill. Outcomes were success rates of obstacle avoidance as well as post-crossing step length, step duration, hip flexion angle at foot-strike, and peak hip extension of the steps measured within 10 seconds following obstacle release. RESULTS: Success rates of obstacle avoidance were lower for people poststroke. Moreover, their first post-crossing step length and duration (ie, the nonparetic step) deviated more from steady gait than those of people in the control group (ie, the right step), with lower values for people poststroke. Similar deviations were observed for post-crossing hip flexion and extension excursions. LIMITATIONS: People poststroke were relatively mildly impaired and used an <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis,</b> which may limit the generalizability of the results to other populations poststroke. CONCLUSIONS: People with poststroke foot drop using an <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis</b> had reduced gait adaptability, as evidenced by lower success rates of obstacle avoidance as well as an impaired capacity to restore steady gait after crossing an obstacle.

40|$|AbstractCerebral palsy (CP) is a {{heterogeneous}} group of permanent, non-progressive motor disorders {{of movement and}} posture. Ankle–foot orthoses (AFOs) are frequently prescribed to correct skeletal misalignments in spastic CP. The present study aims to evaluate {{the effect of the}} three side support <b>ankle–foot</b> <b>orthosis</b> on standing balance of the spastic diplegic CP children. Thirty spastic diplegic CP children participated in this study from both sexes. They were divided randomly into two age and sex matched groups: (Group I: study group and Group II: control group). The degree of spasticity was evaluated by passive movement for both limbs, while the child was completely relaxed. The Biodex stability system, was used for the assessment of the dynamic postural control of all diplegic children. Also the system measures the subject’s ability to control the platform’s angle of tilt. The patient’s performance is noted as stability index which represents the variance of the platform displacement in degrees. Every patient in the study group was exercised on three side support <b>ankle–foot</b> <b>orthosis</b> for 30 min, three times weekly, for 6 months, also they received the same therapeutic exercise program which was given to the control group. The results revealed no significant difference as regards the pre-treatment mean values of all stability indices in both the control and the study groups (P< 0. 05). However comparison between post-treatment mean values of all stability indices in both groups showed significant improvement in favor of the study group (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract Background There are {{a number}} of gaps in the {{evidence}} base for the use of ankle-foot orthoses for stroke patients. Three dimensional motion analysis offers an ideal method for objectively obtaining biomechanical gait data from stroke patients, however there {{are a number}} of major barriers to its use in routine clinical practice. One significant problem is the way in which the biomechanical data generated by these systems is presented. Through the careful design of bespoke biomechanical visualisation software it may be possible to present such data in novel ways to improve clinical decision making, track progress and increase patient understanding in the context of <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis</b> tuning. Methods A single-blind randomised controlled trial will be used to compare the use of biomechanical visualisation software in <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis</b> tuning against standard care (tuning using observation alone). Participants (n = 70) will have experienced a recent hemiplegia (1 - 12 months) and will be identified by their care team as being suitable candidates for a rigid <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis.</b> The primary outcome measure will be walking velocity. Secondary outcome measures include; lower limb joint kinematics (thigh and shank global orientations) & kinetics (knee and hip flexion/extension moments, ground reaction force FZ 2 peak magnitude), step length, symmetry ratio based on step length, Modified Ashworth Scale, Modified Rivermead Mobility Index and EuroQol (EQ- 5 D). Additional qualitative measures will also be taken from participants (patients and clinicians) at the beginning and end of their participation in the study. The main aim of the study is to determine whether or not the visualisation of biomechanical data can be used to improve the outcomes of tuning ankle-foot orthoses for stroke patients. Discussion In addition to answering the primary research question the broad range of measures that will be taken during this study are likely to contribute to a wider understanding of the impact of ankle-foot orthoses on the lives of stroke patients.

40|$|Background and Aim: Ankle joint {{stiffness}} and its {{range of motion}} (ROM) are commonly assessed to determine the appropriate mechanical characteristics required in an effective <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis</b> (AFO) prescription. The aim of this technical note is to present {{the design of a}} manual device that enables their convenient measurement in the clinical setting and to demonstrate its reliability. Technique: The manual device was designed with a torquemeter, a potentiometer, a steering wheel, a rotary plate, and a foot plate.

40|$|Abstract—Orientation sensors {{containing}} magnetometers use the earth’s {{magnetic field}} as a reference. Ferromagnetic objects may distort this magnetic field, leading to inaccurate orienta-tion output. We explored {{the viability of}} these orientation sen-sors for motion analysis in an assistive mobility device rehabilitative setting. We attached two MTx orientation sensors (XSens; Enschade, the Netherlands), connected to the XBus Master data collection unit (XSens), to a plastic frame such that the relative angle between sensors was constant. We then moved a series of mobility devices in proximity to the plastic frame: two knee-ankle-foot orthoses (aluminum, stainless steel), one <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis,</b> two transtibial prosthese...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the changes in mechanical energy due to continuous use of a plantar flexion resistive <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis</b> (AFO) of subjects with chronic hemiplegia. [Subjects and Meth-ods] The subjects were 5 hemiplegic patients using AFOs without a plantar flexion resistive function in their daily lives. We analyzed the gait of the subjects using a 3 D motion capture system under three conditions: patients ’ use of their own AFOs; after being fitted with a plantar flexion resistive AFO; and after continuous use of the device. The gait efficiency was determined by calculating the mutual exchange of kinetic and potential energy of the center of mass. [Results] An increased exchange rate of the kinetic and potential energy was found for all subjects. A larger increase of energy exchange was shown on the non-paralyzed side, and after continuous use of the plantar flexion resistive AFO. [Conclusion] We found that continuous use of a plantar flexion resistive AFO increased the rate of mutual exchange between kinetic energy and potential energy. The change in the rate was closely related to the role of the non-paretic side, showing that the subjects needed a certain amount of time to adapt to the plantar flexion resistive AFO.

40|$|Background and aims: One of {{the most}} common {{movement}} disorders after stroke is foot drop. Its initial treatment is the use of ankle foot orthosis. Recently, Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) is used as a treatment of this deformity and restoring normal gait in patients with weakness or paralysis of the muscles due to stroke or spinal cord injury. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the role of this technique compared with ankle – foot orthosis by correction of gait in stroke patients. Methods: In this review of the literature, a systematic search in different electronic databases (Pubmed, Science direct, and Google scholar) by key words selected such as FES, Stroke, <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis,</b> foot drop and gait was conducted and extracted English articles published between 1989 - 2013 in some areas (using PICO) and the combination between them. Articles containing non- stroke neurological diseases and deformity rather than foot drop were excluded. Results: The results of extracted 32 articles based on positive changes in parameters of gait kinematics, the rate of muscular activities, and spasticity reduction after using FES were reported. So, FES system increases gait velocity, level of motor activity, stride length, and cadence. Conclusion: It seems FES can improve quality of gait in patients with drop foot caused by stroke. Convenience and better cosmetics in FES comparing with <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis</b> could be suitable justifications for better acceptance and tolerance of FES system...|$|E
40|$|Background Ankle-foot orthoses {{are often}} {{provided}} to improve walking in stroke patients, although {{the evidence of}} effects on walking and balance control is still inconsistent. This could {{be caused by a}} lack of insight into the influence of orthoses on the underlying impairments. These impairments can be assessed with dual plate posturography to determine the relative contribution of each lower limb to balance control and weight-bearing. This study examined the effects of ankle-foot orthoses on functional balance, static and dynamic weight-bearing asymmetry and dynamic balance control of the paretic and non-paretic lower limbs. Methods Twenty stroke subjects (time since stroke 5 – 127 months) completed the study. Subjects were assessed with and without <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis.</b> Functional balance was assessed using the Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up & Go test, Timed Balance Test, 10 -m walking test and Functional Ambulation Categories. Weight-bearing asymmetry and dynamic balance control were assessed with force plates on a movable platform. Findings No significant effects of ankle-foot orthoses were found for weight-bearing asymmetry and dynamic balance control, but significant differences in favour of <b>ankle-foot</b> <b>orthosis</b> use were found for most functional tests. Interpretation Although ankle-foot orthoses had no effect on weight-bearing asymmetry or dynamic balance contribution of the paretic lower limb, functional tests were performed significantly better with orthoses. Apparently, improvements at functional level cannot be readily attributed to a greater contribution of the paretic lower limb to weight-bearing or balance control. This finding suggests that ankle-foot orthoses influence compensatory mechanisms. ...|$|E
