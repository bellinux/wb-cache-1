50|$|The {{need for}} a booster dose {{following}} a primary vaccination is evaluated in several ways. One way is to measure the level of antibodies specific against a disease, {{a few years after}} the primary dose is given. <b>Anamnestic</b> <b>response,</b> the rapid production of antibodies after a stimulus of an antigen, is a typical way to measure the {{need for a}} booster dose of a certain vaccine. If <b>anamnestic</b> <b>response</b> is high after receiving a primary vaccine many years ago, there is most likely little to no need for a booster dose. People can also measure the active B and T cell activity against that antigen after {{a certain amount of time}} that the primary vaccine was administered, or determine the prevalence of the disease in vaccinated populations.|$|E
50|$|An <b>anamnestic</b> <b>response</b> in {{medicine}} is a delayed immunologic response. The term is frequently used in transfusion medicine and {{refers to a}} re-exposure incident where antibody is formed on initial exposure to an antigen in a transfused unit, but the specific memory B cell population fades over time, with antibody becoming undetectable over years. If a patient is re-exposed to the same offending antigen in a future transfusion (which might happen because the antibody screen would in fact be negative), {{there would still be}} a massive, rapid production of IgG antibody against the antigen, which will predictably lyse the transfused red cells, a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction.|$|E
50|$|Kidd {{antibodies}} {{are dangerous}} {{as they are}} capable of causing severe acute hemolytic transfusion reactions ('kidd kills'). They are unique in that {{they are capable of}} dropping to low or even undetectable levels after several months following an exposure event. Thus, on pre-transfusion testing, an anti-Jka or -Jkb may go undetected. Following transfusion, a subsequent robust antibody response in the patient can occur (<b>anamnestic</b> <b>response),</b> resulting in hemolysis of the transfused red blood cells. Kidd antibodies are often capable of binding complement and causing intravascular hemolysis. More often, however, Kidd antibodies cause acute extravascular hemolysis. They are a notoroious cause of delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs); up to a week after transfusion in some instances. Kidd antibodies only rarely cause hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn.|$|E
40|$|Infection of CBA/J mice {{with low}} doses of strain WE {{lymphocytic}} choriomeningitis (LCM) virus resulted in high cell-mediated and relatively low humoral virus-specific immune phenomena; <b>anamnestic</b> <b>responses</b> were marked. In contrast, infection with {{high doses of}} this virus induced no or low degrees of cell-mediated immune phenomena but higher antibody concentrations. Subsequent challenge of these mice did not reveal cell-mediated immunity. However, transfer of spleen cells from mice suppressed as to cell-mediated immunity together with virus into X-irradiated recipients led to marked <b>anamnestic</b> <b>responses.</b> Furthermore, when spleen cells from mice previously infected with low virus doses were injected into mice previously infected with high virus doses, cell-mediated immune phenomena could not be induced by concomitantly inoculated virus, although in controls <b>anamnestic</b> <b>responses</b> were readily evoked.

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} {{long-term}} effectiveness of hepatitis B virus vaccine {{and the need}} for a booster dose among children who received three doses of vaccine during infancy in Red Sea Governorate. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed. Interviews with children (9 months to 16 years) and parents were done. Blood samples to assess Hepatitis B markers were tested. Children showing no seroprotection received a booster dose to assess their <b>anamnestic</b> <b>response</b> after four weeks and one year later. RESULTS: None of the participants had evidence of chronic Hepatitis B. The seroprotection rate was 23. 3 % and it significantly decreased with age. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that older age was the significant predicting variable for having no seroprotective level, while baseline anti-HBs level < 3. 3 IU/L was the predicting variable for not developing early <b>anamnestic</b> <b>response</b> or loss of late <b>anamnestic</b> <b>response.</b> CONCLUSION: Long-term immunity persists among children who received complete series of hepatitis B vaccination during infancy even in absence or reduction of anti-HBs over time.

40|$|Background & Aims: The {{long-term}} immunogenicity {{and efficacy}} of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination remain to be defined. We aimed to examine the long-term immunogenicity {{and efficacy of}} HBV vaccination with 3 different regimens over 18 years of follow-up. Methods: A total of 318 Chinese subjects receiving 3 different regimens of HBV vaccination (2 -dose recombinant vs. 3 -dose recombinant vs. 3 -dose plasma-derived vaccines) without receiving a booster dose were recruited. The HBV serologic markers, including hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs), and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc), were determined at yearly follow-up. After 18 years, 88 subjects were still being followed up. Results: Compared with subjects receiving the 2 -dose regimen, subjects receiving the 3 -dose regimens had a significantly higher geometric mean titer of anti-HBs and a higher proportion had anti-HBs titers â‰¥ 10 mIU/mL during the 18 years of follow-up. There were no differences in these 2 parameters between subjects receiving the 3 -dose recombinant and subjects receiving the 3 -dose plasma-derived vaccines. A total of 88 <b>anamnestic</b> <b>responses</b> were documented in 70 subjects (8 with initial anti-HBs titers < 100 mIU/mL at 12 months and 7 with anti-HBs titers < 10 mIU/mL before the <b>anamnestic</b> <b>responses).</b> No subject became positive for HBsAg. Three subjects had benign breakthrough HBV infection without leading to chronicity indicated by isolated anti-HBc positivity. Conclusions: There was less long-term immunogenicity associated with the 2 -dose regimen {{when compared with the}} 3 -dose regimens of HBV vaccination.

The development {{of large numbers of}} IgA and IgG antibody-secreting cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen and high levels of serum IgA and IgG antibodies to Ag I/II and CT demonstrated that a response to both antigens occurred. At least two to three intragastric doses of 15 micrograms or more of Ag I/II-CTB conjugate, plus free CT as an adjuvant, were needed to induce the salivary IgA anti-Ag I/II response, which peaked at about 35 days and persisted at lower levels for 5 to 6 months.

40|$|Iccosomes {{derived from}} {{follicular}} dendritic cells (FDC) {{are believed to}} play an important role in dispersion of antigen necessary for induction of anamnestic responses. Because FDC are aberrant and iccosome release has not been observed in aged mice, we hypothesized that these animals would be impaired in their ability to mount anamnestic responses. To test this, anamnestic responses were compared in aged and control mice. To ensure the presence of functional lymphocytes, some aged mice were reconstituted with T- and B-memory cells obtained from control mice. Anamnestic responses in aged mice were markedly depressed even when given functional memory cells. To more directly relate the impaired antibody response of aged mice to FDC function, antigen-bearing FDC from either aged or control mice were incubated with T- and B-memory cells from control mice to induce an <b>anamnestic</b> <b>response.</b> Antigen retained by FDC from aged mice was much less immunogenic than antigen retained by FDC from control mice. Since iccosome formation does not appear in aged mice, iccosome-like fragments were generated by sonicating FDC from aged mice and tested for their ability to induce an <b>anamnestic</b> <b>response.</b> This procedure restored the ability of antigen retained on FDC from aged mice to induce a normal <b>anamnestic</b> <b>response.</b> These data support the concept that the inability to form and disperse iccosomes contributes to the impaired ability of aged mice to mount anamnestic antibody responses and provides further support for the role of iccosomes in anamnestic responses...|$|E

40|$|Cholera, {{caused by}} Vibrio cholerae, is a noninvasive {{dehydrating}} enteric disease {{with a high}} mortality rate if untreated. Infection with V. cholerae elicits long-term protection against subsequent disease in countries where the disease is endemic. Although the mechanism of this protective immunity is unknown, it has been hypothesized that a protective mucosal response to V. cholerae infection may be mediated by <b>anamnestic</b> <b>responses</b> of memory B cells in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. To characterize memory B-cell responses to cholera, we enrolled a cohort of 39 hospitalized patients with culture-confirmed cholera and evaluated their immunologic responses at frequent intervals over the subsequent 1 year. Memory B cells to cholera antigens, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the protein antigens cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) and toxin-coregulated pilus major subunit A (TcpA) were enumerated using a method of polyclonal stimulation of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} followed by a standard enzyme-linked immunospot procedure. All patients demonstrated CTB, TcpA, and LPS-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA memory responses by day 90. In addition, these memory B-cell responses persisted up to 1 year, substantially longer than other traditional immunologic markers of infection with V. cholerae. While the magnitude of the LPS-specific IgG memory B-cell response waned at 1 year, CTB- and TcpA-specific IgG memory B cells remained significantly elevated at 1 year after infection, suggesting that T-cell help may result in a more durable memory B-cell response to V. cholerae protein antigens.

40|$|Background Hepatitis B (HB) {{has been}} {{classified}} as moderate-to-highly endemic in Indonesia. HB vaccination, {{the most effective}} method to prevent HB viral transmission, induces protective antibodies against HB surface antigen (anti-HBs). However, these antibodies decline in titer over time. Studies on the duration of protection and the prevalence of non-responders in Indonesian adolescents have been limited. Objectives To determine anti-HBs titers in 15 - 17 -year old Indonesian adolescents given primary HB vaccine during infancy and the prevalence of non-responders after a HB vaccine booster dosage. Methods This cross-sectional study was performed from February to September 2008 on adolescents aged 15 - 17 years in three senior high schools in Jakarta who received complete primary HB vaccines during infancy, based on parentsâ€™ recall. Investigations included HB vaccination history, anthropometric measurements, and blood tests for anti-HBs before and 4 - 6 weeks after a booster dose of HB vaccine. Results Of 94 subjects, 35 had protective anti-HBs and 59 had undetectable anti-HBs. A booster dose was administered to 58 of the non-protected subjects, of which 33 showed <b>anamnestic</b> <b>responses.</b> However, 25 subjects failed to generate protective anti-HBs. Taking into consideration the adolescents with protective anti-HBs {{before and after the}} booster dose, serologic protection was demonstrated in 73 %. Non-responder prevalence was 27 %. The high prevalence of non-responders may indicate bias of parentsâ€™ recall. Conclusion Protective anti-HBbs is detected in less than half of Indonesian adolescents given primary HB vaccine during infancy.

A long-term study was designed to follow antibody persistence and immune memory on an annual basis for up to 15 years following vaccination during adolescence. MethodsSubjects received a combined hepatitis A and B vaccine (Twinrixâ„¢, GSK Vaccines, Belgium) at 12 â€“ 15 years of age, either as 2 -dose of the adult formulation or 3 -dose of the paediatric formulation. Blood samples were taken every year thereafter to assess antibody persistence and immune memory to hepatitis A and B. Antibodies to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) and hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) were measured at Years 11 â€“ 15. At Year 15 immune memory was further assessed by measuring the <b>anamnestic</b> <b>response</b> to a challenge dose of the monovalent vaccine, which was administered to subjects whose antibody concentrations fell below the pre-defined cut-offs (anti-HAV: < 15 mIU/mL; anti-HBs: < 10 mIU/mL). Results 209 subjects returned for follow-up at Year 15 of whom 162 were included in the long-term according-to-protocol immunogenicity cohort. All subjects remained seropositive for anti-HAV antibodies, while 81. 1 % and 81. 8 % still had anti-HBs antibodies â‰¥ 10 mIU/mL in the 2 - and 3 -dose groups, respectively.

40|$|Protective host defense {{mechanisms}} against vaginal Candida albicans {{infections are}} poorly understood. Although cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is the predominant host defense mechanism against most mucosal Candida infections, {{the role of}} CMI against vaginal candidiasis is uncertain, both in humans and in an experimental mouse model. The role of humoral immunity is equally unclear. While clinical observations suggest a minimal role for antibodies against vaginal candidiasis, an experimental rat model has provided evidence for a protective role for Candida-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies. Additionally, Candida vaccination-induced IgM and IgG 3 antibodies are protective in a mouse model of vaginitis. In the present study, the role of infection-induced humoral immunity in protection against experimental vaginal candidiasis was evaluated through the quantification of Candida-specific IgA, IgG, and IgM antibodies in serum and vaginal lavage fluids of mice with primary and secondary (partially protected) infection. In naÃ¯ve mice, total, but not Candida-specific, antibodies were detected in serum and lavage fluids, consistent with lack of yeast colonization in mice. In infected mice, Candida-specific IgA and IgG antibodies were induced in serum with <b>anamnestic</b> <b>responses</b> to secondary infection. In lavage fluid, while Candida-specific antibodies were detectable, concentrations were extremely low with no <b>anamnestic</b> <b>responses</b> in mice with secondary infection. The incorporation of alternative protocolsâ€”including infections in a different strain of mice, prolongation of primary infection prior to secondary challenge, use of different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay capture antigens, and concentration of lavage fluidâ€”did not enhance local Candida-specific antibody production or detection. Additionally, antibodies were not removed from lavage fluids by being bound to Candida during infection. Together, {{these data suggest that}} antibodies are not readily present in vaginal secretions of infected mice and thus have a limited natural protective role against infection...|$|R
40|$|Reinjection of antigen into immunized rabbits usually {{results in}} an {{immediate}} increase of circulating antibody-antigen complex. This immediate formation of complex seems to depend upon the presence of non-precipitating antibody before reinjection. The complex disappears by the 2 nd day after reinjection and reappears between the 4 th to 7 th day. This is earlier than its first appearance after a primary injection and may indicate an <b>anamnestic</b> <b>response</b> of the non-precipitating antibody responsible {{for the formation of}} circulating antibody-antigen complex...|$|E
40|$|Vaccination against Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) became {{mandatory}} in Italy for all newborns and 12 years-old {{individuals in the}} 1991. The immunogenicity of HBV vaccine {{and the effectiveness of}} the universal immunization strategy have been widely demonstrated. However the need to assess the antibody concentrations above the well known serological correlate of protection for HBV infection (â‰¥ 10 mIU/mL), established in individuals immunized with a 3 doses vaccination course, is still recommended in subjects exposed to occupational risks in different settings, particularly the healthcare services. This practice has to be performed during the preventive medical examination, before the workerâ€™s exposure to biological hazards, as a fundamental part of Occupational Health Surveillance Programs in several Countries, including Italy: the goal is to assure individual protection, also providing booster doses when needed, after many years following the primary vaccination. During the 2011 - 2013 period, an observational study was performed in Healthcare students (HCSs) trained at a regional university acute-care hospital in North- Western Italy, properly immunized against HBV during infancy or adolescence, in order to evaluate the persistence of seroprotection and to assess the <b>anamnestic</b> <b>response</b> to booster vaccination. Data from 717 subjects undergoing HbsAg Ab and HBc Ab testing during the preventive medical examination, and receiving a booster dose of HBV vaccine when resulting with a non-protective titer (< 10 mIU/mL), were collected and analyzed. Most of the HCSs (74. 6 %) included in the survey, mean age 24. 8 y (Â± 4. 6 SD), had received the primary vaccination course {{during the first year of}} life (3 - 5 - 11 months). Globally, 507 (70. 7 %) HCSs showed protective antibody titres, and an <b>anamnestic</b> <b>response</b> was observed in more than 95 % subjects receiving the booster dose. Our study demonstrated the long-term persistence of protection of HBV vaccine, more than 20 y following the primary immunization, in HCSs who are exposed to occupational health risk. The <b>anamnestic</b> <b>response</b> observed in non-seroprotected subjects who received the booster further confirms the capability of the HBV vaccine to create a strong immunological memory...|$|E
40|$|In {{the primary}} {{response}} of mice and rabbits immunized with foreign red cells, 6 -MP administration prolonged {{the formation of}} 19 S antibody. 7 S antibody formation was delayed and reduced in these animals. Animals treated with 6 -MP during primary response exhibited a preferential 19 S response when challenged in the <b>anamnestic</b> <b>response.</b> Animals immunized with small doses of antigen and treated with 6 -MP only during the secondary response, reversed the usual antibody pattern and responded with preferential 19 S antibody formation...|$|E
40|$|Neonatal {{guinea pigs}} {{during the first}} 2 weeks of life did not {{indicate}} the presence of delayed hypersensitivity intradermally, after sensitization with purified soluble antigens in dose levels that induced detectable delayed hypersensitivity in the skin of adults. Although Arthus type allergy was detectable in newborns, circulating antibody frequently preceded its appearance by several days. Passive Arthus reactions were not produced in newborns as readily as in adults. Contact hypersensitivity and allergic encephalomyelitis were induced in newborns, but corneal reactions were not. Total body irradiation with 200 r inhibited antibody formation in newborns, as in adults. In addition, the induction period for <b>anamnestic</b> <b>responses</b> in newborns and the antigen elimination rate {{were the same as}} in adults. Passive transfer of delayed hypersensitivity from sensitized newborns to normal adults was accomplished...|$|R
40|$|CD 8 + T cells {{eliminate}} intracellular infections {{through two}} contact-dependent effector functions: cytolysis and antiviral cytokine secretion. Here, we identify an additional function for memory CD 8 + T cells persisting at frontline sites of microbial exposure: as local sensors of previously encountered antigens that precipitate innate-like alarm signals and draw circulating memory CD 8 + T cells into the tissue. When memory CD 8 + T cells {{residing in the}} female reproductive tract encountered cognate antigen, they expressed interferon-Î³ (IFN-Î³), potentiated robust local inflammatory chemokine expression and induced rapid recruitment of circulating memory CD 8 + T cells. <b>Anamnestic</b> <b>responses</b> in frontline tissues are thus an integrated collaboration between frontline and circulating populations of memory CD 8 + T cells, and vaccines should establish both populations to maximize rapid responses...|$|R
40|$|Anti-horse {{erythrocyte}} (anti-HRBC) antibody synthesis was {{studied in}} normal, early thymectomized and adult thymectomized axolotls. The kinetics {{of the responses}} {{were similar to those}} described in the same species for antibody synthesis against bacterial or viral antigens. Booster injections did not induce any characteristic <b>anamnestic</b> <b>responses.</b> Early and adult thymectomized axoltls gave in three experimental groups higher anti-HRBC responses than controls. It is concluded that HRBC acts in the axolotl as a thymus-independent antigen. The enhanced response in early as well as in adult thymectomized animals can be interpreted by the presence of a suppressor T-cell activity on anti-HRBC synthesis. These results do not exclude possible thymus-dependent responses for antibody synthesis in the axolotl, although such responses were not demonstrated in urodele. The questionable lacking of some functional T-cell subsets in urodele is discussed as a working hypothesis...|$|R
