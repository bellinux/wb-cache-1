5|$|Brand and Bond are imprisoned {{where the}} blast from the Moonraker's engines will incinerate them, to leave {{no trace of}} them once the Moonraker is launched. Before the firing, the couple escape. Brand gives Bond the proper {{coordinates}} to redirect the gyros <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>the</b> Moonraker into the sea. Having been in collaboration with Soviet Intelligence all along, Drax and his henchman attempt to escape by Russian submarine—only to be killed as the vessel flees through the waters onto which the Moonraker has been re-targeted. After their debriefing at headquarters, Bond meets up with Brand, expecting her company—but they part ways after she reveals that she is engaged to a fellow Special Branch officer.|$|E
5|$|NBC ran three BOCs, in Burbank, California, Chicago, and New York City, {{with the}} last the largest. Cline was {{stationed}} at the New York BOC for the game. In the era before satellite transmission, programming was transmitted by coaxial cable line, {{with the cooperation of}} the telephone company. For this game, the Burbank BOC was to receive the feed from Oakland, insert commercials and network announcements, <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>the</b> modified feed via telephone wire to a switching station west of Chicago near the Mississippi River. An engineer was stationed there to activate the Oakland feed into the entire network when the game began, to cut it on instruction and then to return to his base. He had been told to expect at 6:58:20 Eastern Time a network announcement for Heidi, after which he was to cut the feed from Burbank, and the Heidi feed from New York would begin. This placed Burbank in effective control of whether the engineer would cut the feed, since he would act upon hearing the announcement.|$|E
5|$|The 1999 final saw Australia face France at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. Two tries by Owen Finegan and Ben Tune, {{and seven}} {{penalties}} by Matt Burke contributed to Australia's 35–12 win, as {{they became the}} first nation to win the Rugby World Cup twice. Australia also became the first side to contest successive finals when they faced England in the 2003 final at the Telstra Stadium in Sydney. The hosts opened the scoring in the sixth minute through a Lote Tuqiri try. England responded and scored three penalties by fly-half Jonny Wilkinson and a try by winger Jason Robinson to achieve a 14–5 lead at half-time. Three penalties from Elton Flatley {{in the second half}} allowed Australia to level the score <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>the</b> final into extra time. Wilkinson and Flatley scored a penalty apiece before the former scored a drop goal in the last minute of the match to give England a 20–17 victory. They became the first side from the Northern hemisphere to win the tournament.|$|E

25|$|Ville-Marie was a {{noteworthy}} {{site for}} it {{was the center of}} defense against the Iroquois, the point of departure for all western and northern journeys, and the meeting point to which the trading Indians brought their annual furs. This placed Ville-Marie, later known as Montreal, at the forefront against the Iroquois, which resulted in its trade being easily and frequently interrupted. The Iroquois were in alliance with the Dutch and English, which allowed them to interrupt the French fur trade <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>the</b> furs down the Hudson River to the Dutch and English traders.|$|E

25|$|WAAS uses {{a network}} of {{ground-based}} reference stations, in North America and Hawaii, to measure small variations in the GPS satellites' signals in the western hemisphere. Measurements from the reference stations are routed to master stations, which queue the received Deviation Correction (DC) <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>the</b> correction messages to geostationary WAAS satellites {{in a timely manner}} (every 5 seconds or better). Those satellites broadcast the correction messages back to Earth, where WAAS-enabled GPS receivers use the corrections while computing their positions to improve accuracy.|$|E
25|$|In the 1996 Western Conference Semi-finals {{against the}} Chicago Blackhawks, Jeremy Roenick {{was stopped by}} Roy on a {{break-away}} during overtime in Game 4, while apparently being hauled down by Avalanche defenceman Sandis Ozolinsh. The referees did not call for a penalty shot on the play and the Avalanche won in triple overtime on Joe Sakic's game-winning goal. Earlier in Game 3, Roenick scored on an unchallenged breakaway to tie the score at 3 <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>the</b> game to overtime; and the Blackhawks ended up winning.|$|E

25|$|As the Russian Army {{moved closer}} to Poland, the Germans decided to {{liquidate}} the special ghetto-clearing unit of which Halberstam was a member. All the prisoners were taken to a field outside of Warsaw, told to undress and stand near open pits, where soldiers prepared to machine-gun them. At the last moment, however, a car sped into the field. A high-ranking officer jumped out and communicated the special order from Berlin to stop the execution <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>the</b> prisoners to the Dachau concentration camp, where they were needed as slave laborers.|$|E
25|$|Summerall {{told the}} rest of CBS crew {{to get ready for}} a {{roll-out}} pass, because without any timeouts remaining a failed run play would end the game. Landry would say he expected a rollout pass attempt because an incompletion would stop the clock and allow the Packers one more play on fourth down, either for a touchdown (to win) or a field goal attempt (to tie <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>the</b> game into overtime). But Green Bay's pass protection on the slick field had been seriously tested during the game; the Cowboys had sacked Starr eight times.|$|E
25|$|The Seahawks then {{played in}} the NFC Championship Game at home against the rival San Francisco 49ers; the two teams had each won once against the other during the regular season. Despite {{entering}} halftime with a 7-point deficit, the Seahawks {{took the lead in}} the fourth quarter thanks largely to Colin Kaepernick losing one fumble and throwing two interceptions. The second interception came in the final seconds of the game when Richard Sherman batted the ball into the arms of Malcolm Smith to seal the 23–17 win <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>the</b> Seahawks to their second Super Bowl in franchise history.|$|E

The Capitals won the first four sets, three of them in tiebreakers, to take a 20–15 lead to the final set. De Voest and Fisher beat Mark Knowles and Sam Warburg in men's doubles, 5–3 to take that final set <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>the</b> match to overtime with the Capitals leading 23–20. Knowles and Warburg won {{the first game of}} overtime to give the Capitals the title, 24–20. Despite the Buzz's loss, de Voest was named WTT Championship Most Valuable Player.|$|E
25|$|Facing {{off against}} New Jersey in Nashville on December 3, the Predators, thanks to goals from Fiala (with two), Josi and Subban, carried a 4–1 lead {{into the third}} period. But the Devils responded {{in the third period}} with three goals from Michael Cammalleri, Andy Greene and Adam Henrique to tie the score <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>the</b> game into overtime. Cammalleri scored with 18 seconds {{remaining}} in overtime to hand the Predators a 5–4 loss. The next evening, the Predators, who had been 27 for 28 in power play kills at home, gave up two power play goals to Wayne Simmonds in a 4–2 loss to the Philadelphia Flyers.|$|E
25|$|These {{limitations}} {{were made}} clear during the Vietnam War, when early missiles like the AIM-4 Falcon and AIM-9 Sidewinder had success {{rates on the}} order of 9 and 14%, respectively. Much of this was {{due to the fact that}} pilots had been trained to approach using radar or ground-controlled interception, which placed the enemy aircraft somewhere in front of them, but not necessarily flying in the same direction. In these situations, the seeker might see the target's engine <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>the</b> growling signal that indicated lock-on, but would fail to track when fired because the target would move out of the FOV in the time while the missile was flying off the mounting rail.|$|E

25|$|In Week 11, the Redskins {{would face}} the {{struggling}} Philadelphia Eagles in Washington. RGIII would {{have one of}} his best games of his career to date, as the Redskins won 31-6 with long touchdowns to Santana Moss and Aldrick Robinson. The Redskins would win their next 6 games after that, including a Thanksgiving Day win over the Dallas Cowboys, an overtime win against the eventual champs, the Baltimore Ravens, and a 38-21 win over the Cleveland Browns that featured backup rookie quarterback Kirk Cousins as the starter, filling in for RGIII who got an injured knee against the Ravens. The Redskins would win their crucial last game against the Cowboys, which would clinch the division for them <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>the</b> Redskins to the playoffs.|$|E
25|$|Starrcade {{represented}} {{in many ways}} WCW's golden opportunity to pull farther ahead of the WWF <b>and</b> <b>send</b> <b>the</b> federation to its demise. The Montreal Screwjob left fans irate at Vince McMahon over his treatment {{of one of his}} biggest stars and many were considering a switch to WCW. With WCW steadily making money and firmly dominating the ratings battle, the PPV could have been a devastating blow to the WWF's comeback. However, WCW proved it was no different in alienating its fan base than the WWF. Even though the buy rate for Starrcade '97 was the largest WCW had ever seen for a PPV, it was the turning point in the Monday Night Wars and the WWF would soon be on the rise.|$|E
