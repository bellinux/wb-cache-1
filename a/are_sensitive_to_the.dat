5|$|Conversely, DST can {{adversely}} affect farmers, parents of young children, and others whose hours are {{set by the}} sun and they have traditionally opposed the practice, although some farmers are neutral. One reason why farmers oppose DST is that grain is best harvested after dew evaporates, so when field hands arrive and leave earlier in summer their labor is less valuable. Dairy farmers are another group who complain of the change. Their cows <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> timing of milking, so delivering milk earlier disrupts their systems. Today some farmers' groups {{are in favor of}} DST.|$|E
5|$|Some Hydnellum {{species have}} been shown to be in decline in Europe, {{including}} the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Norway, and Scotland. In the United Kingdom, several are listed in the biodiversity action plan for stiped hydnoid fungi: H. aurantiacum is classified as critically endangered; H. caeruleum, H. ferrugineum are listed as endangered, while H. concrescens, H. spongiosipes, H. peckii, and H. scrobiculatum are considered vulnerable.

5|$|Tennyson is not {{the only}} one that uses the image; John Everett Millais's {{painting}} Mariana is based on Tennyson's version of Mariana, and lines 9 through 12 of Tennyson's poem were used for the catalogue description of the painting. Similarly, Millais's version served as the inspiration for Elizabeth Gaskell's novel, Mariana. Tennyson's Mariana and Gaskell's main character, Ruth, <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sounds around them and are constantly looking out of their window in image that represents their imprisonment within their homes. The image of Mariana used by Tennyson and the later works are equally of a woman who is weary.|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists' work on {{globalization}} is diverse and multifaceted. But {{much of it}} is tied together through detailed and nuanced studies {{of the ways in which}} globalization affects women in particular and how these effects relate to socially just outcomes. Often country case studies are used for these data. Some feminist economists focus on policies involving the development of globalization. For example, Lourdes Benería argues that economic development in the Global South depends in large part on improved reproductive rights, gender equitable laws on ownership and inheritance, and policies that <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> proportion of women in the informal economy. Additionally, Nalia Kabeer discusses the impacts of a social clause that would enforce global labor standards through international trade agreements, drawing on fieldwork from Bangladesh. She argues that although these jobs may appear exploitative, for many workers in those areas they present opportunities and ways to avoid more exploitative situations in the informal economy.|$|E
5|$|Some animals, notably insects such as {{the honey}} bee, <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{polarisation}} of light. Honey bees can use polarized light on overcast days to estimate {{the position of the}} sun in the sky, relative to the compass direction they intend to travel. Karl von Frisch's work established that bees can accurately identify the direction and range from the hive to a food source (typically a patch of nectar-bearing flowers). A worker bee returns to the hive and signals to other workers the range and direction relative to the sun of the food source by means of a waggle dance. The observing bees are then able to locate the food by flying the implied distance in the given direction, though other biologists have questioned whether they necessarily do so, or are simply stimulated to go and search for food. However, bees are certainly able to remember the location of food, and to navigate back to it accurately, whether the weather is sunny (in which case navigation may be by the sun or remembered visual landmarks) or largely overcast (when polarised light may be used).|$|E

Individual cells do not thrive; a minimum of four proximate cells was required for subsequent organoid development. Modifications to the medium composition produced either hollow spheres mainly composed of pancreatic progenitors, or complex organoids that spontaneously undergo pancreatic morphogenesis and differentiation. Maintenance and expansion of pancreatic progenitors require active Notch and FGF signaling, recapitulating in vivo niche signaling interactions.|$|E
25|$|Incorrect fitting can distort (warp) discs; {{the disc}}'s {{retaining}} bolts (or the wheel/lug nuts, if the disc is simply sandwiched {{in place by}} the wheel, as on many cars) must be tightened progressively and evenly. The use of air tools to fasten lug nuts can be bad practice, unless a torque wrench is also used for final tightening. The vehicle manual will indicate the proper pattern for tightening as well as a torque rating for the bolts. Lug nuts should never be tightened in a circle. Some vehicles <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> force the bolts apply and tightening should be done with a torque wrench.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{photoreceptor}} cells, rods and cones, which are sensitive to different aspects of light. Rod cells <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> intensity of light over a wide frequency range, thus are responsible for black-and-white vision. Rod cells are not present on the fovea, the area of the retina responsible for central vision, and are not as responsive as cone cells to spatial and temporal changes in light. There are, however, twenty times more rod cells than cone cells in the retina because the rod cells are present across a wider area. Because of their wider distribution, rods are responsible for peripheral vision.|$|E

25|$|Popping results <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rate {{at which}} the kernels are heated. If heated too quickly, the steam in the outer layers of the kernel can reach high {{pressures}} and rupture the hull before the starch {{in the center of the}} kernel can fully gelatinize, leading to partially popped kernels with hard centers. Heating too slowly leads to entirely unpopped kernels: the tip of the kernel, where it attached to the cob, is not entirely moisture-proof, and when heated slowly, the steam can leak out of the tip fast enough to keep the pressure from rising sufficiently to break the hull and cause the pop.|$|E
25|$|Villagers <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{power and}} {{to the needs of}} the spirit world. According to {{observations}} by an American missionary in the early 1970s, villagers consulted the local guardian spirit to find out what the coming year would bring, a new province chief held a ceremony to ask the protection of the spirits over the province, and soldiers obtained magic cloths and amulets from mediums and shamans to protect them from the bullets of the enemy. Before embarking on a mission against enemy forces, a province chief might burn incense and call on a spirit for aid in defeating the enemy. Examples of Brahman influences were various rituals concerned with the well-being of the nation carried out by the ruler and the baku (a Brahman priestly group attached to the royal court). These rituals were reportedly stopped after Sihanouk's ouster in 1970 (see The March 1970 Coup d'État, ch. 1).|$|E
25|$|Salt marshes {{are located}} among {{different}} landforms {{based on their}} physical and geomorphological settings. Such marsh landforms include deltaic marshes, estuarine, back-barrier, open coast, embayments and drowned-valley marshes. Deltaic marshes are associated with large rivers where many occur in Southern Europe such as the Camargue, France in the Rhone delta or the Ebro delta in Spain. They are also extensive within the rivers of the Mississippi Delta in the United States. In New Zealand, most salt marshes occur {{at the head of}} estuaries in areas where there is little wave action and high sedimentation. Such marshes are located in Awhitu Regional Park in Auckland, the Manawatu Estuary, and the Avon-Heathcote Estuary in Christchurch. Back-barrier marshes <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reshaping of barriers in the landward side of which they have been formed. They are common along much of the eastern coast of the United States and the Frisian Islands. Large, shallow coastal embayments can hold salt marshes with examples including Morecambe Bay and Portsmouth in Britain and the Bay of Fundy in North America.|$|E

25|$|A related finding {{regarding}} statistical cues to phonological acquisition is {{a phenomenon}} known as the perceptual magnet effect. In this effect, a prototypical phoneme of a person’s native language acts as a “magnet” for similar phonemes, which are perceived as belonging to {{the same category as}} the prototypical phoneme. In the original test of this effect, adult participants were asked to indicate if a given exemplar of a particular phoneme differed from a referent phoneme. If the referent phoneme is a non-prototypical phoneme for that language, both adults and 6-month-old infants show less generalization to other sounds than they do for prototypical phonemes, even if the subjective distance between the sounds is the same. That is, adults and infants are both more likely to notice that a particular phoneme differs from the referent phoneme if that referent phoneme is a non-prototypical exemplar than if it is a prototypical exemplar. The prototypes themselves are apparently discovered through a distributional learning process, in which infants <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> frequencies with which certain sounds occur and treat those that occur most often as the prototypical phonemes of their language.|$|E
25|$|Evidence from {{a series}} of four {{experiments}} conducted by Gomez and Gerken suggests that children are able to generalize grammatical structures with less than two minutes of exposure to an artificial grammar. In the first experiment, 11-12 month-old infants were trained on an artificial grammar composed of nonsense words with a set grammatical structure. At test, infants heard both novel grammatical and ungrammatical sentences. Infants oriented longer towards the grammatical sentences, in line with previous research that suggests that infants generally orient for a longer amount of time to natural instances of language rather than altered instances of language e.g.,. (This familiarity preference differs from the novelty preference generally found in word-learning studies, due to the differences between lexical acquisition and syntactical acquisition.) This finding indicates that young children <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> grammatical structure of language even after minimal exposure. Gomez and Gerken also found that this sensitivity is evident when ungrammatical transitions are located {{in the middle of the}} sentence (unlike in the first experiment, in which all the errors occurred at the beginning and end of the sentences), that the results could not be due to an innate preference for the grammatical sentences caused by something other than grammar, and that children are able to generalize the grammatical rules to new vocabulary.|$|E
