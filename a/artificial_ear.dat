40|$|The <b>artificial</b> <b>ear</b> {{specified}} in IEC 60318 - 1 {{is used for}} the measurement of headphones and has been designed to present an acoustic load equivalent to that of normal human ears. In this respect it is {{specified in}} terms of an acoustical impedance, and modelled by a lumped parameter approach. However, this has some inherent frequency limitations and becomes less valid as the acoustic wavelength approaches the characteristic dimensions within the device. In addition, when sound propagates through structures such as narrow tubes, annular slits or over sharp corners, noticeable thermal and viscous effects take place causing further departure from the lumped parameter model. A new numerical model has therefore been developed, which gives proper consideration to the aforementioned effects. Both kinds of losses can be simulated by means of the LMS Virtual Lab acoustic software which facilitates finite and boundary element modelling of the whole <b>artificial</b> <b>ear.</b> A full 3 D model of the <b>artificial</b> <b>ear</b> has therefore been developed based on key dimensional data found in IEC 60318 - 1.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The malleus-incus complex (MIC) plays {{a crucial}} role in the hearing process as it {{transforms}} and transmits acoustically-induced motion of the tympanic membrane, through the stapes, into the inner-ear. However, the transfer function of the MIC under physiologically-relevant acoustic stimulation is still under debate, especially due to insufficient quantitative data of the vibrational behavior of the MIC. This study focuses on the investigation of the sound transformation through the MIC, based on measurements of three-dimensional motions of the malleus and incus with a full six degrees of freedom (6 DOF). METHODS: The motion of the MIC was measured in two cadaveric human temporal bones with intact middle-ear structures excited via a loudspeaker embedded in an <b>artificial</b> <b>ear</b> canal, in the frequency range of 0. 5 - 5 kHz. Three-dimensional (3 D) shapes of the middle-ear ossicles were obtained by sequent micro-CT imaging, and an intrinsic frame based on the middle-ear anatomy was defined. All data were registered into the intrinsic frame, and rigid body motions of the malleus and incus were calculated with full six degrees of freedom. Then, the transfer function of the MIC, defined as velocity of the incus lenticular process relative to velocity of the malleus umbo, was obtained and analyzed. RESULTS: Based on the transfer function of the MIC, the motion of the lenticularis relative to the umbo reduces with frequency, particularly in the 2 - 5 kHz range. Analysis of the individual motion components of the transfer function indicates a predominant medial-lateral component at frequencies below 1 kHz, with low but considerable anterior-posterior and superior-inferior components that become prominent in the 2 - 5 kHz range. CONCLUSION: The transfer function of the human MIC, based on motion of the umbo and lenticularis, has been visualized and analyzed. While the magnitude of the transfer function decreases with frequency, its spatio-temporal complexity increases significantly...|$|E
40|$|Increased use of {{communication}} headsets found in various workplaces raises concerns regarding exposure to potentially hazardous noise levels. Current {{national and international}} standards specify {{a wide range of}} simple and specialized methods for the measurement of sound exposure under communication headsets. However, to date, quantitative data comparing the degree of agreement between the different measurement methods or their relative performance are lacking, and it is not known if occupational health and safety (OHS) or hearing loss prevention (HLP) stakeholders have the necessary training and equipment to integrate them in their daily practice. A three-step study addressing several knowledge gaps on this topic is presented in this thesis. First, a questionnaire survey distributed to OHS and HLP stakeholders has revealed that knowledge of specialized measurement techniques and access to the necessary equipment varies significantly depending on the training of the different professionals. There is therefore reason to specify several methods in measurement standards to meet the specific needs and expertise of the different stakeholders involved. Second, a series of experiments conducted with single and multiple expert participants indicated that the Type 1 <b>artificial</b> <b>ear</b> is not suited for sound exposure measurement with communication headsets, while Type 2 and Type 3. 3 artificial ears are in good agreement with the acoustic manikin technique specified in the International standard ISO 11904 - 2.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D) - University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2009. Maize ear rots {{are among}} the most {{important}} impediments to increased maize production in Africa. Besides yield loss, they produce mycotoxins in their host whose contamination has been linked to several human and animal mycoses. The main objectives of the studies reported on in this thesis were (i) to investigate farmer perceptions of maize ear rot disease and prospects for breeding for host plant resistance in Zambia; and (ii) to establish the levels of incidence and extent of maize ear rot infection as well as the level of mycotoxins in the maize crops of smallholder farms in central and southern Zambia; (iii) to appraise the field inoculation techniques and assess them for their suitability for the Zambian environmental conditions, (iv) to determine the combining ability of Zambian maize populations for resistance to ear rot and investigate the genetic basis of this resistance; and (v) to investigate both direct and indirect responses to full-sib selection for ear rot resistance in Zambian maize populations. A participatory rural appraisal (PRA) was conducted in four communities, involving a total of 90 farmers. Participatory methods were used, such as focused group discussions, group interviews, participant scoring and ranking. Farmers ranked and scored the various constraints affecting their maize production in general and the maize ear rots in particular. Ear rots were ranked as the third most important biotic stress and it was evident that although farmers were aware of the disease, they were not aware of mycotoxins. This was reflected in the way they disposed of rotten maize: either by feeding livestock or eating it in periods of hunger. The survey of ear rots and mycotoxins was carried out in the Southern and Central Provinces of Zambia. A total of 114 farms were covered in the survey: maize samples were collected and both ear rot fungi and mycotoxins were isolated. Fusarium and Stenocarpella were the most frequently isolated fungi from smallholder farms. The levels of fumonisins on these farms ranged from 0. 05 to 192 ppm, while those of aflatoxins were between 1. 5 and 10. 6 ppb. In 50 % of the farmsteads surveyed, the mycotoxins, i. e. fumonisins and aflatoxins, exceeded the recommended FAO/WHO 1 limits of 2 ppm and 2 ppb, respectively. Five field inoculation techniques namely, colonised toothpick, leaf whorl placement, ear top placement, spore suspension spray, and silk channel injection, were evaluated over three seasons in a series of experiments. It was found that the leaf whorl placement of inoculums, followed by colonized toothpick method, gave a constant ranking of genotypes across locations and years compared to the other three methods. In addition, the use of a mixture of ear rots as inoculum was as effective as its principal single species constituents. In the population diallel analysis, five broad-based maize populations were crossed in a diallel and evaluated under <b>artificial</b> <b>ear</b> rot inoculation using an inoculum mixture of three ear rot fungi, Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium verticilloides and Stenocarpella maydis at four locations in Zambia. The purpose was to estimate general (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) and investigate genotype x environment interaction. GCA effects were found not to be significant for disease severity but were significant for grain yield across environments. Populations with a strong GCA effect for disease severity across sites included PRA 783244 c 3, Pop 25, MMV 600, and ZUCASRc 2. Across sites, the F 1 combinations, MMV 600 x Pop 25, ZUCASRc 2 X Pop 25, and Pop 25 x PRA 783244 c 2 had strong SCA effects for root lodging, ear drooping, husk cover and ear insect damage. In a related diallel analysis of 10 full-sib families derived from these populations, it was observed that resistant x susceptible families and their reciprocal crosses performed better than their resistant parents, suggesting an over dominant expression of resistance. Both maternal and non maternal effects were observed to be influencing resistance to ear rots. There was a preponderance influence of non-additive gene action. A response to full-sib recurrent selection was conducted in four locations in Central Zambia. Out of the 343 families created in 2005 / 6 season, 10 % were selected from each population and recombined to create five new populations. These, with the original populations, were evaluated in four sites during the 2007 / 8 season. There was a net reduction in ear rot incidence and rot severity in the new synthetic population. Pop 10 had the largest reduction in disease severity. The predicted gain per cycle was - 4. 1 % and realized gain was - 2. 5 % for disease incidence, and 0. 19 % and 19. 4 % for grain yield. Genetic variability was maintained though with low heritability estimates. Negative but at times strong association between grain yield and ear rot disease severity was detected suggesting that in general selecting for ear rot resistance would enhance grain yield in the five populations. Overall the importance of the ear rots and mycotoxins in compromising yield and health of the communities in Zambia, respectively, were confirmed and support the call to improve maize varieties for resistance to ear rots. The results indicate that the five populations could be enhanced for ear rot resistance through population improvement procedures such reciprocal recurrent selection that exploit both additive and non-additive variation. Selection might be compromised by the large genotype x environment interaction effects, and large reciprocal effects and their interaction with the environments. To enhance repeatability genotypes should be artificially inoculated, by placing the inoculum in the leaf whorl followed by colonized toothpick inoculation, and screened in many environments to identify genotypes with stable resistance to ear rots...|$|E

Karoliina Nikula, University of Helsinki. In 1995, after a {{long period}} of lobbying and political action, sign language was granted a legal status in Finland. In 1997, the first cochlear implant surgeries were performed on children in Finland. At present, 90 percent of deaf children undergo cochlear implant surgery. The use of sign language as a first language is diminishing. The majority of deaf children are born to hearing parents, and they are being asked to make the choice whether their children should receive cochlear implants or not. Previous empirical studies have shown that some parents feel that their choices are not always respected. The aim of this research project is to study cochlear implant clinical practices using the concepts of goodness, capability, and choice, as well as to analyse whether the shift in clinical practices from sign language to spoken language is based on careful deliberation and reasonable arguments. This study helps us to better understand the parents process of deciding whether or not to obtain cochlear implants for their children, and the family s journey through treatment options and standard clinical practices. In addition, this study provides tools for parents of deaf children to assist their decision-making and to medical practitioners who advise these parents. The study is focused around the following research questions: (1) What constitutes medical goodness for a child born deaf? (2) In what ways do cochlear implants and sign language promote a deaf child s capabilities? (3) Is it adequate to speak of choice when thinking about the dilemmas of parents of children born deaf? The research methodology is philosophical concept and argumentation analysis along with analysis of the construction of the concept of choice. The research data consists of various sources and literature. The sources can be divided into the following: 1) Avaintietokansio [materials made available to families of the deaf]; 2) publications of the Satakieli seminars; 3) brochures and other information provided by device manufacturers; 4) DVD and video recordings; 5) Internet pages; and 6) legislation. The literature is comprised of (1) previous empirical studies on the parents of deaf children obtaining treatment for their children. Empirical studies on family experience include materials published by the Finnish Association of the Deaf and the Institute for the Languages of Finland, e. g., Suomen viittomakielten kielipoliittinen ohjelma (2010); a publication of the Ombudsman for Children Hei, kato mua! (Johanna Kiili and Kirsi Pollari, eds., 2012); and Riia Celen s documentary Sanoja sormenpäissä (2009) and Minna Luukkainen s Viitotut elämät: Kuurojen nuorten aikuisten kokemuksia viittomakielisestä elämästä Suomessa (2008). These provide information on the experiences of families whose deaf children are being treated. Internationally, Stuart Blum s The <b>Artificial</b> <b>Ear</b> (2010) also provides information on the experiences of families. (2) Ethical and medical discourse on cochlear implants in deaf children. (3) Previous philosophical and ethical work, particularly the following: a) Martha Nussbaum s capability approach; b) Georg Henrik von Wright s The Varieties of Goodness (1963, Finnish translation 2001); and c) rational choice theory, especially in the work of Jon Elster. In addition, (4) methodological handbooks (e. g., literature about the conceptual tools) were used. The study is organized as follows. Chapter two examines deafness from two points of view: audiological and socio-cultural. I also introduce topics often associated with deafness, such as sign language and deaf culture. Here I also discuss the technical aspects of cochlear implants and provide a brief history of the deaf in Finland. In chapters 3 5 I examine the three main concepts goodness, capabilities, and choices with reference to the research questions. These provide essential conceptual tools when analysing the issue, as the processes connected to cochlear implants are centred around the question of what constitutes a good life for the child, the child s ability to develop, and the choices that parents in this situation must make. My research demonstrates the following: (1) The transition from sign language to spoken language is not based on sound arguments. This study did not find a solid rationale for reducing the use of sign language in order to rehabilitate hearing. Giving up sign language cannot be said to promote the child s good, capabilities, or opportunities to make independent choices in the future. On the contrary, it may indeed interfere with them. (2) In conjunction with the cochlear implant treatment process, it sometimes seems that the ideas of promoting choice and increasing capabilities are more of an illusion. We can also speak of language as an illusion in the sense that in the literature I surveyed (as well as in this discourse), language is often used synonymously with spoken language. The rhetoric used directs choice and creates impressions. We cannot speak of a family s autonomous, rational choices if the situation does not meet the criteria for choice. (3) Occasionally, the process seems to be about audism, i. e., valuing spoken language over signed language, medicalization, technological imperatives, and the treatment of cochlear implants as an ideological issue. All of these can {{have an effect on the}} decision-making processes of parents. (4) Cochlear implant clinical practices differ from general health care practices in the sense that implant practices are not always based on evidence (e. g., there is no evidence of the advantages of choosing not to learn sign language; there is as yet no knowledge of the long-term effects of cochlear implants). Furthermore, health care usually focuses only on areas within the medical field, but a language is not only a medical issue. Health care practices are usually based on research results, limited to areas in which medical authorities have competence and designed to maximize the patient s capabilities. (5) Legislation, different schools of thought, and treatment practices create different ways of understanding deafness. Legislation treats the deaf in terms of language and handicap. Different schools of thought lead to polarized discourse about deafness. Finally, according to the reports of parents, current clinical practices require them to choose one language for their child, although it would be possible to choose both sign language and spoken language. These divisions in the discourse may affect the decision-making of parents. (6) The idea of choice is not the best way to promote the well-being of deaf children. Focusing instead on capabilities would free parents and health care practitioners from the burden of predicting outcomes which will only come with time: that is, if all capabilities are promoted, it is not necessary to know how hearing or speech will develop, what the child would like to do or be when s/he grows up, or what sort of future the child will have. A discourse of choice creates an either/or, rather than a both/and situation. Both/and is a better platform from which to develop a child s full capabilities. (7) The concepts of goodness, capabilities, and choice provide useful tools to examine cochlear implant clinical practices and the dilemma of families with deaf children. These concepts can also be used more generally in thinking about ethical considerations in medical practice, as they represent fundamental issues in terms of both ethics and health care practice. (8) Cochlear implant clinical practices need to be developed. This study shows that written materials supporting parental decisions need to be improved, and care needs to be taken that space is given to different alternatives. In addition, more multi- and cross-disciplinary co-operation needs to be developed to improve the prospects for deaf children. Based on this study, I suggest that in the future we need to focus on four issues. First, we must pay attention to the rhetoric used in legislation, in information packets for families of the deaf, and in the research literature. Second, instead of talking about choice, we must take into consideration the child s strengths and skills on many levels. Third, we should consider the possibilities offered by multiculturalism, which includes different types of language choices, as well as multi- and cross-disciplinary clinical teams. If advice is being given on language, the treatment team should include a language specialist as well as a member who knows sign language. This study affirms the need for further multi- and cross-disciplinary co-operation. Fourth, deaf children should be treated as a whole person, not simply through their hearing or lack thereof.

Syntymäkuurojen lasten sisäkorvaistutehoitokäytännön sosiaalieettistä tarkastelua. [Promoting The Good of The Child. A Social-Ethical Analysis of Cochlear Implants in Children Born Deaf]. Karoliina Nikula, The University of Helsinki. Viittomakieli sai Suomessa pitkään kestäneen edunvalvonnan ja poliittisen toiminnan tuloksena perustuslaillisen aseman vuonna 1995. Vuonna 1997 alettiin Suomessa leikata lapsille sisäkorvaistutteita. Suurin osa kuuroista lapsista syntyy kuuleville vanhemmille. Nyt 2010 -luvulla 90 prosentille kuuroista lapsista asennetaan sisäkorvaistute leikkauksella. Viittomakielen käyttö ensikielenä on vähentynyt. Vanhemmat asetetaan valintatilanteeseen: asennetaanko sisäkorvaistute vai ei? Aiemmissa empiirisissä selvityksissä on käynyt ilmi, että osa vanhemmista on kokenut, että heidän valintojaan ei ole aina kunnioitettu. Tämän tutkimuksen tavoite oli tarkastella lasten sisäkorvaistutehoitokäytännettä käyttämällä apuna hyvän, kyvyn ja valintojen käsitteitä, sekä analysoida, pohjautuuko yleisissä hoitolinjauksissa tapahtunut siirtymä viittomakielestä puhuttuun kieleen, huolelliseen harkintaan ja perusteltuihin argumentteihin. Tutkimus auttaa ymmärtämään, mistä sisäkorvaistuteprosessissa eli vanhempien päätöksenteossa ja perheen matkassa hoitopolulla ja hoitokäytänteessä oikeastaan on kysymys. Lisäksi tutkimus antaa välineitä vanhemmille kuuroa lastaan koskevaan päätöksentekoon ja hoitohenkilökunnalle neuvontatyöhön. Lähdin selvittämään tutkimusongelmaa erityisesti seuraavien tutkimuskysymysten avulla: (1) Mikä on syntymäkuuron lapsen terveydellinen hyvä? (2) Miten sisäkorvaistute ja viittomakieli edistävät kuuron lapsen kykyjä? (3) Onko valinnoista puhuminen kaikkein adekvaatein tapa tarkastella syntymäkuuron lapsen vanhempien tilannetta? Tutkimuksen metodi oli filosofinen käsite- ja argumentaatioanalyysi sekä valinnan käsitteen osalta käsitteen konstruointi. Apuna käytin Georg Henrik von Wrightin hyvän muunnelmia, kyvykkyyksien lähestymistapaa ja Martha Nussbaumin keskeisten kyvykkyyksien listaa, sekä Jon Elsterin rationaalisen valinnan teoriaa. Tutkimuksen aineisto koostui lähteistä ja kirjallisuudesta. Lähteet voitiin jakaa seuraavasti: 1) Avaintietokansion artikkelit, 2) Satakieliseminaarin julkaisut, 3) Laitevalmistajien esitteet ja muut esitteet, 4) DVD- ja videotallenteet, 5) Internetsivut, 6) Lainsäädäntö. Kirjallisuus muodostui: (1) Aiemmista empiirisistä aineistoista koskien kuurojen lasten vanhempien kokemuksia hoitopolulla. Empiirisiä aineistoja perheiden kokemuksista kuvaavat muun muassa Kuurojen Liiton ja Kotimaisten kielten tutkimuskeskuksen Suomen viittomakielten kielipoliittinen ohjelma (2010), Lapsiasiainvaltuutetun toimiston julkaisu Hei, kato mua! (toim. Johanna Kiili ja Kirsi Pollari 2012), Riia Celenin ohjaama dokumentti Sanoja sormenpäissä (2009) ja Minna Luukkaisen Viitotut elämät. Kuurojen nuorten aikuisten kokemuksia viittomakielisestä elämästä Suomessa (2008). Ne tarjoavat tietoa muun muassa perheiden kokemuksista hoitopolulta. Kansainvälisesti myös Stuart Blumen teos The <b>Artificial</b> <b>ear</b> (2010) tarjoaa tietoa perheiden kokemuksista. (2) Kuuroja lapsia koskevasta eettisestä ja lääketieteellisestä sisäkorvaistutediskurssista. (3) Aiemmasta filosofisesta ja etiikan alaan kuuluvasta tutkimuksesta ja kirjallisuudesta, erityisesti seuraavien henkilöiden ajattelusta: a) Martha Nussbaumin kyvykkyyksien lähestymistapa (capability approach), b) Georg Henrik von Wrightin Hyvän muunnelmia (alkuperäinen 1963, suomennos 2001), c) rationaalisen valinnan teorian osalta erityisesti Jon Elsterin ajattelua. Lisäksi (4) Metodioppaista (käsitevälineitä koskeva kirjallisuus). Tutkimus etenee seuraavasti. Luvussa kaksi esittelen kuuroutta kahdesta näkökulmasta: audiologiesta ja sosio-kulttuurisesta. Lisäksi esittelen kuurouteen yleisesti yhdistettyjä asioita, kuten viittomakieltä ja kuurojen kulttuuria. Esittelen myös sisäkorvaistutetta teknisenä laitteena ja kuurojen historiaa Suomessa. Luvuissa 3 - 5 käsittelen kolmen pääkäsitteen, hyvä, kyvyt ja valinnat, avulla tutkimuskysymyksiä. Hyvä, kyvyt ja valinnat ovat olennaisia käsitevälineitä asian tarkastelussa, sillä prosessissa on kyse lapsen hyvästä elämästä, lapsen kykyjen kehittymisestä ja vanhempien asettamisesta valintatilanteeseen. Tutkimuksessa ilmeni, että: (1) Siirtymä viittomakielestä puhuttuun kieleen ei ole tapahtunut perustellusti. Kestäviä perusteita viittomakielen käytön vähentämiseen kuulon kuntoutukseen liittyvin perustein ei tämän tutkimuksen perusteella ole. Viittomakielestä luopumisen ei voida sanoa edistävän lapsen hyvää, kykyjä ja omaa mahdollisuutta tehdä itsenäisiä valintoja tulevaisuudessa, vaan päinvastoin, se voi haitata niitä. (2) Toisinaan sisäkorvaistuteprosessissa voidaan puhua valinnan ja kykyjen/toimintavalmiuksien edistämisen illuusiosta. Kielestä illuusiona voidaan puhua sikäli, että kieli oli käyttämässäni kirjallisuudessa (ja tässä diskurssissa) usein synonyymi puhutulle kielelle. Käytetty retoriikka ohjaa valintoja ja luo mielikuvia. Perheiden autonomisista rationaalisista valinnoista ei voida puhua, jos tilanne ei täytä valinnan käsitteellisiä kriteereitä. (3) Voidaan sanoa, että toisinaan prosessissa on kyse audismista, eli puhutun kielen arvostamisesta yli viitotun kielen; medikalisaatiosta, teknologisesta imperatiivista ja ideologisoitumisesta. Nämä voivat vaikuttaa vanhempien päätöksentekoprosessiin. (4) Sisäkorvaistutehoitokäytänteet poikkeavat terveydenhuollon yleisistä toimintaperiaatteista, sillä hoitokäytänteet eivät aina perustu näyttöön (viittomakielen poisvalikoinnin eduista ei ole näyttöä, sisäkorvaistutteen pitkäaikaisvaikutuksista ei ole tietoa), eivätkä lääketieteeseen (kieli ei ole vain lääketieteellinen asia). Yleensä terveydenhuollon toiminta perustuu tutkimusnäytölle, lääketieteen osaamisalueeseen ja kyvykkyyksien monipuolistamiseen. (5) Lainsäädäntö, koulukuntajako ja hoitokäytänteet ylläpitävät kahtiajakoa, miten ymmärtää kuuroutta. Lainsäädäntö kohtelee kuuroja kieliryhmänä ja vammaisryhmänä, koulukuntajako polarisoi keskustelua, hoitokäytänteissä on vanhempien kertoman mukaan edellytetty vain toisen kielen valitsemista, vaikka voisi myös valita molemmat. Kahtiajako diskurssissa voi vaikuttaa vanhempien päätöksentekoon. (6) Valinnoista puhuminen ei ole paras tapa edistää kuuron lapsen hyvää. Kykypohjainen ajattelu vapauttaa vanhemmat ja hoitohenkilökunnan tietämisen taakasta: jos edistetään kyvykkyyksiä monipuolisesti, ei tarvitse tietää, miten kuulo tai puhe kehittyvät, mitä lapsi itse isona haluaisi tehdä tai olla, tai millainen tulevaisuus on. Valintapuhe saa aikaan joko-tai asetelman, ei sekä-että asetelmaa. Sekä-että asetelma tulisi paremmin esiin, jos kehitettäisiin kaikkia kapasiteetteja. (7) Hyvän, kyvyn ja valinnan käsitteet tarjoavat käyttökelpoiset käsitevälineet tarkastella sisäkorvaistutehoitokäytännettä ja kuurojen lasten perheiden tilannetta. Käytetyt käsitevälineet voivat olla laajemminkin apuna terveydenhuollon etiikan keskeisissä kysymyksissä, koska ne edustavat perustavanlaatuisesti merkityksellisiä asioita terveydenhuollon etiikan ja toiminnan kannalta. (8) Sisäkorvaistutehoitokäytänteissä on kehitettävää. Tämän tutkimuksen mukaan tulisi kehittää kirjallista materiaalia päätöksenteon tueksi ja huolehtia siitä, että on aidosti tilaa erilaisille valinnoille. Lisäksi tulisi lisätä moni- ja poikkitieteellistä yhteistyötä kuurojen lasten hyväksi. Tutkimuksen perusteella ehdotetaan, että jatkossa otetaan huomioon erityisesti neljä asiaa. Ensinnäkin, kiinnitetään huomiota käytettyyn retoriikkaan lainsäädännössä, neuvontatilanteissa ja kirjallisuudessa. Toiseksi, valitsemisesta puhumisen sijaan otetaan huomioon lapsen vahvuudet ja monipuoliset kyvyt. Kolmanneksi, otetaan huomioon monikulttuurisuus mahdollisuutena. Se sisältää monenlaiset kielivalinnat, moni- ja poikkitieteellisyyden hoitotiimeissä. Jos annetaan kieleen liittyvää neuvontaa, hoitotiimissä on perusteltua olla kielen asiantuntija ja joku viittomakielentaitoinen työntekijä. Tutkimuksen perusteella esitetään kutsu moni- ja poikkitieteelliseen tutkimusyhteistyöhön. Neljänneksi, kuurot lapset otetaan huomioon kokonaisvaltaisesti, ei vain kuulon tai sen puutteen kautta...|$|E
40|$|The {{acoustical}} {{function of}} the outer ear consists of the collection and forwarding of an acoustical signal {{as well as its}} directional spectral transformation. The objective of the present paper is the presentation of the acoustical characteristics of the outer ear of two domestic dogs with long erect ears by determinating of the acoustical transfer functions by means of <b>artificial</b> <b>ear</b> models with exact anatomical dimensions. The binaural and monaural features of the signals connected to the tympanic membrane were examined as a potential information source for sound localization. The methodological approach was verified by comparison with the data determined by the same means at a ear model of cat to those of published results using anaesthetized cats. Moreover has the anatomical construction and the measurements of the outer ear prints been described. The experiments were carried out inside an anechoic chamber (IBAC). The measurements were carried out with different acoustic source positions in the horizontal plane (azimuth of 0 ý to 360 ý in 10 ý steps). A band limited pseudo noise (500 Hz to 20 kHz) was employed as acoutic stimuli with a duration of one second. The signal was measured by means of a miniature microphone instead of the tympanic membrane. As a reference, the same signal in the free field was recorded. The transformation of the acoustic signals from the free field to the eardrum was described (head related transfer function). Furthermore the interaural time difference of the 500 Hz sine tone was determined. For the testing procedure, different artificial outer ear models were constructed., which differed {{in the direction of the}} pinna (ear position set forward and sideways). Since the concha is characterized by small cartilaginous protuberances, we have modified the model by eliminating these special structures. Furthermore, the original models were modified when the pinna was removed or veterinary manipulations were simulated such as an Otitis operation or the reduction of the size of the pinna (cropping). A further point was the representation of the influence and the importance of the head for the transfer functions which was implemented by employing an artificial head in an experimental setup. The following results were obtained: 1) The data of the external ear models of the cat show that plastic models with realistic sizes show the same directivity as the outer ears of anaesthetized animals. 2) The outer ear of the dogs has a marked directivity and supplies binaural (interaural level differences and interaural time differences) and monaural spectral features which allow an unambiguous inference to the sound direction of the incidence. 3) Interaural time differences of the 500 Hz sine tone allow an unambiguous definition of the sound direction of the incidence. The amount of the directional interaural time differences is enlarged clearly by the head. 4) Tree frequency regions have been defined by different directional-dependent sound pressure transformations of the outer ear a) Sound signals with frequencies from the low-frequency region (500 Hz to 1000 Hz) show no appreciable monaural and interaural directional-dependent modification of their level differences. b) Sound signals with frequencies from the mid-frequency region (1 kHz to 4 kHz) are clearly amplified via 10 dB. The directional-dependent markedness of the first and most prominent broad peak in the free field transfer functions is made out. The spectral maximum which is developed by frequencies between 2, 5 kHz to 4 kHz lies in this broad peak. c) Sound signals with frequencies more than 4 kHz (higher-frquency region: 4 kHz to 17 kHz) shows the highest directional behaviour in the examined frequency range. Notch and futher peaks whose concrete values strong show individual differences are developed. The central frequency of the first notch shows a marked direction dependence with both animals. The monaural and interaural level differences of higher frequency signals change clearly during modifications of the acoustic source position and supply unambiguous information on the definition of the horizontal acoustic source position. 5) The most important acoustical {{function of the}} pinna lies in the possibility of focusing on a specific sound field of the incidence. Because of the mobility of the outer ear, dogs are able to arrange the pinna at a sound event. When the pinna is oriented directly towards the source, the pressure ratio reaches a maximum. Simultaneously sound signals (noise interference) from other directions are decreased. The acoustical spectral and spatial axes are in the field of the open face of the pinna. The position of first notch varies continuously with changes of the acoustic source position in the frontal sound field. In this way, ear position sets up the set forward especially for available sound events from the frontal field direction information. 6) The small cartilaginous protuberances of the concha and the upper frontal edge of the external auditory canal produce the first notch if direct acoustic waves fall into the open face of the pinna. If the protuberances are missing, an alternation of the sound direction of incidence in the frontal sound field does not produce a change of the monaural level differences from sound signal with frequencies between 500 Hz and 10 kHz. 7) The intensity of low-frequency sound signals (lower 1 kHz) is nearly no influenced by the head. At sound with frequencies over 1 kHz, the head affects the amplification of frontal sound caused by the outer ear as well as the attenuation of the sound supporting in the case of contralateral and reverse incidence. Furthermore, the directional shift of the position of the first notch caused by the outer ear is stabilized by the head and the sound field of incidence, in which the rise of its central frequency is observed, is extended. 8) Veterinary manipulations of the outer ear modify its directivity. The consequences of an Otitis operation for directional hearing are to be hardly estimated since the effects they represent for itself in the prevention of the training of the first notch in the case of some sound directions of arrival from the frontal field. This notch embodies an important directional monaural feature there. 9) Removing a part of the pinna, as while cropping, has no dramatic effects on the directivity of the outer ear. However, focusing onto a specific sound field of the incidence is limited. In this case, the scale of influence increases with the size of the reduction. On the other hand, absence of the entire pinna produces a loss on direction information for frequencies below 9 kHz and in the range from 14 kHz to 16 kHz The data on the example of domestic dogs with long erect ears demonstrate that the process and the spectral features of the transfer functions are to be traced back to specific morphological structures in the outer ear. As a result, it is possible to provide directional information by transforming a stimulus...|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} {{industrial}} environments which {{are exposed to}} a high-level noise. It is necessary to protect people from the noise. Most of the time, the consumer requires a miniature version of a noise canceller to satisfy the internal working place requirements. Very {{important thing is to}} select the most appropriate personal hearing protection device, for example an earplug. It should guarantee high passive noise attenuation and allow for secondary sound generation in case of active control. In many cases the noise is nonstationary. For instance, some of the noisy devices are switched on and off, speed of some rotors or fans changes, etc. To avoid any severe transient acoustic effects due to potential convergence problems of adaptive systems, a fixed-parameter approach to control is appreciated. If the noise were stationary, {{it would be possible to}} design an optimal control filter minimising variance of the signal being the effect of the acoustic noise and the secondary sound interference. Because of noise nonstationarity for most applications, the idea of generalised disturbance defined by a frequency window of different types has been developed by the authors and announced in previous publications. The aim of this paper is to apply such an approach to different earplugs and verify its noise reduction properties.
