5|$|Observations of {{gravitational}} waves promise to complement observations in the electromagnetic spectrum. They {{are expected to}} yield information about black holes and other dense objects such as neutron stars and white dwarfs, <b>about</b> <b>certain</b> kinds of supernova implosions, and about processes {{in the very early}} universe, including the signature of certain types of hypothetical cosmic string. In February 2016, the Advanced LIGO team announced that they had detected gravitational waves from a black hole merger.|$|E
5|$|Olaf and Thorgerd lived happily {{together}} at Hoskuldstead for some time. Around 962 Olaf's foster father Thord died, leaving Olaf his property and goðorð Olaf bought land {{and built a}} new homestead at Hjardarholt, which, according to the saga, he had to cleanse of the draugr of its former owner, Killer-Hrapp. As time went on people began to settle near Olaf's hall and regarded him as their goði. Olaf's ever-increasing wealth caused jealousy from Hoskuld's wife Jorunn. Around the same time Olaf and Thorgerd had a daughter, Thurid. Hjardarholt was renowned for its rich decorations; some two decades later, the skald Úlfr Uggason composed the famous poem Húsdrápa, <b>about</b> <b>certain</b> mythological scenes illustrated {{on the walls of}} Olaf's hall.|$|E

5|$|Series one of {{the show}} aired in September of that year, {{consisting}} of five two-part half-hour stories. Individual half-hour episodes aired once a week on BBC One, with episodes airing a week ahead on children's digital channel CBBC. The final part aired in November 2007. The second series started in September 2008 using the same format, with six stories instead of five, ending the series in December. The third series started 15 October 2009, twice weekly (Thursdays and Fridays) on BBC One from 15 October to 20 November. The fourth series aired from 11 October 2010. The first of each story pair was accompanied by an episode of Sarah Jane's Alien Files, a set of 25-minute episodes in which {{a member of the}} cast updates Mr. Smith's database <b>about</b> <b>certain</b> aliens. It accompanied series 4 of the programme.|$|E
5|$|The {{scope of}} ecology {{contains}} {{a wide array}} of interacting levels of organization spanning micro-level (e.g., cells) to a planetary scale (e.g., biosphere) phenomena. Ecosystems, for example, contain abiotic resources and interacting life forms (i.e., individual organisms that aggregate into populations which aggregate into distinct ecological communities). Ecosystems are dynamic, they do not always follow a linear successional path, but they are always changing, sometimes rapidly and sometimes so slowly that it can take thousands of years for ecological processes to bring <b>about</b> <b>certain</b> successional stages of a forest. An ecosystem's area can vary greatly, from tiny to vast. A single tree is of little consequence to the classification of a forest ecosystem, but critically relevant to organisms living in and on it. Several generations of an aphid population can exist over the lifespan of a single leaf. Each of those aphids, in turn, support diverse bacterial communities. The nature of connections in ecological communities cannot be explained by knowing the details of each species in isolation, because the emergent pattern is neither revealed nor predicted until the ecosystem is studied as an integrated whole. Some ecological principles, however, do exhibit collective properties where the sum of the components explain the properties of the whole, such as birth rates of a population being equal to the sum of individual births over a designated time frame.|$|E

25|$|Likewise, the Eastern Orthodox Church {{has always}} {{recognized}} the gradual {{development in the}} complexity of the articulation of the Church's teachings. It does not, however, believe that truth changes and therefore always supports its previous beliefs {{all the way back to}} what it holds to be the direct teachings from the Apostles. The Church also understands that not everything is perfectly clear; therefore, it has always accepted a fair amount of contention <b>about</b> <b>certain</b> issues, arguments <b>about</b> <b>certain</b> points, as something that will always be present within the Church. It is this contention which, through time, clarifies the truth. The Church sees this as the action of the Holy Spirit on history to manifest truth to man.|$|E
25|$|The 16th-century jurist Domnall O'Davoren {{created a}} {{glossary}} {{in which he}} quoted from many other sources.

25|$|Although {{many members}} of the Church of England today would still be uncomfortable or sceptical <b>about</b> <b>certain</b> Catholic liturgical practices, they can be {{astonished}} to be told that, in the late 19th century, using incense, wearing vestments, putting candles on the altar and using unleavened (wafer) bread in the Eucharist could spark riots, put priests in prison and even led in 1888–90 to the prosecution of a bishop – Edward King, Bishop of Lincoln.|$|E

25|$|The {{mass media}} face {{a number of}} {{pressures}} that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims {{in terms of their}} credibility within the scientific community as a whole.

25|$|Adam's {{information}} on Woman Land probably originated from a German bishop Adalvard the Younger (as hinted by IV 19s amendment scholia 119) {{who had been}} a bishop in Skara and spent time in Norway in the court of king Harald Hårdråde, most probably in the then-capital Trondheim. This would also explain Adam's detailed knowledge <b>about</b> <b>certain</b> parts of Norway, since he mentions Trondheim (Trondemnis) several times (Gesta III 59, IV 16, 32, 33, 34) and even Hålogaland (Halagland) from northern Norway (IV 37). Sami people (Scritefinnis, Scritefingi) are also mentioned several times (IV 24, 25, 31) and usually at the same time when he discusses Norwegians.|$|E
