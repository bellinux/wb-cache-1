5|$|On his deathbed, the King of Fynn tasks {{the party}} to seek {{the help of the}} {{seemingly}} extinct dragoons of Deist. In Deist, the party finds only <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>with</b> her son, learning that {{all but one of the}} Dragoons are dead, partly as a result of Imperial poison. After placing an egg of the last wyvern in a cavern, the party returns to Altair and rescues Hilda from the Empire a second time, before successfully reclaiming Fynn from the Imperial forces. They then travel west in search of a powerful magic item, joining forces with the last surviving dragoon on the way. The party returns to Fynn and sees that many towns have been destroyed by a cyclone summoned by the Emperor. The party calls upon the newly born last wyvern to take them to a castle inside the cyclone, where they confront and kill the Emperor. Back at Fynn, everyone celebrates the Empire's defeat, but a mortally wounded Fynn soldier arrives and reveals that Leon has taken the throne and plans to destroy the Rebels with the Imperial army.|$|E

25|$|Modigliani was {{the fourth}} child, whose birth coincided with the {{disastrous}} financial collapse of his father's business interests. Amedeo's birth saved the family from ruin; according to an ancient law, creditors could not seize the bed of a pregnant woman or <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>with</b> a newborn child. The bailiffs entered the family's home just as Eugenia went into labour; the family protected their most valuable assets by piling them on top of her.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} the {{cultural}} adaptation of perspective include {{the view of the}} Virgin Mary as <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>with</b> humility (rather than a heavenly queen) as the Franciscans began to preach in China, and its similarity to the local Chinese motherly and merciful figure of Kuanyin, which was much admired in south China. Another example is the Saint Juan Diego's account of the appearance of the Virgin of Guadalupe in 1531 as a tanned Aztec princess who spoke in his local Nahuatl language. The clothing of the Virgin of Guadalupe image has been identified as that of an Aztec princess.|$|E

500|$|Rho(D) immune {{globulin}} antibodies {{are specific}} for human RhD antigen. Anti-RhD antibodies are administered {{as part of}} a prenatal treatment regimen to prevent sensitization that may occur when a Rh-negative mother has a Rh-positive fetus. Treatment of <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>with</b> Anti-RhD antibodies prior to and immediately after trauma and delivery destroys Rh antigen in the mother's system from the fetus. It {{is important to note that}} this occurs before the antigen can stimulate maternal B cells to [...] "remember" [...] Rh antigen by generating memory B cells. Therefore, her humoral immune system will not make anti-Rh antibodies, and will not attack the Rh antigens of the current or subsequent babies. Rho(D) Immune Globulin treatment prevents sensitization that can lead to Rh disease, but does not prevent or treat the underlying disease itself.|$|E

500|$|Aval Appadithan explores {{a number}} of themes such as women's liberation, sex and the chauvinistic {{attitude}} of males. Its central theme is on women and their plight in society, as exemplified by Manju and her relationships. Born to a timid father and <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>with</b> loose moral values, she is also subsequently affected by two people she becomes romantically involved with. One, her college mate, left her to marry someone else {{for the sake of}} a job; and the second is Mano, the son of a Christian priest, who used her to satisfy his lust and then trivialised their relationship by calling her [...] "sister" [...] in front of her parents. These relationships result in her becoming wary of men and developing an aggressive nature towards them. Conversations related to matters like the status of women in contemporary (1978) times and the nature of humankind are frequently seen in the film.|$|E
500|$|Two {{years after}} the first {{monument}} was destroyed by the police, a new Shaheed Minar (Monument of Martyrs) was constructed in 1954 to commemorate the protesters who lost their lives. Work on a larger monument designed by the architect Hamidur Rahman began in 1957 {{with the support of the}} United Front ministry. Hamidur Rahman's model consisted of a large complex in the yard of the Dhaka Medical College Hostel. The design included a half-circular column [...] symbolizing <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>with</b> her martyred sons standing at the dais in the center of the monument. Although the imposition of martial law in 1958 interrupted the work, the monument was completed and inaugurated on 21 February 1963 by Abul Barkat's mother, Hasina Begum. Pakistani forces demolished the monument during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, but the Bangladeshi government reconstructed it in 1973. Ekushey Television, the first private terrestrial TV channel of Bangladesh was named after the Event of 21 February.|$|E
500|$|Gestation {{lasts for}} two to three months, {{following}} which a litter of one to four kittens is born. Births take place in secluded areas, for example in dense vegetation or burrows abandoned by aardvarks and porcupines. Blind at birth, newborn weigh nearly [...] and have soft, woolly hair (greyer than in adults) and unclear markings. The eyes open after nine to thirteen days. Weaning begins after a month of birth; the mother brings small kills to her kittens and calls out to them as she approaches the [...] "den". <b>A</b> <b>mother</b> <b>with</b> young kittens rests for a notably lesser time and has to spend almost twice the time and energy for hunting than do other servals. If disturbed, the mother will shift her kittens one by one to a more secure place. Kittens eventually start accompanying their mother to hunts. At around six months, they acquire their permanent canines and begin to hunt themselves; they leave their mother at about 12 months of age. They may reach sexual maturity from 12 to 25 months of age. Life expectancy is about 10 years in the wild, and up to 20 years in captivity.|$|E

500|$|Lancashire's final role {{under her}} ITV {{contract}} was Gertrude Morel in {{an adaptation of}} D.H. Lawrence's 1913 novel Sons and Lovers, airing in January 2003. The portrayal–her first of <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> <b>with</b> adult children– followed Gertrude's transformation from a young bride into a fifty-something woman ravaged by her life experiences of poverty and domestic abuse. Lancashire re-read the novel several times prior to filming, and identified with the themes of filial and marital relationships she {{had been unable to}} appreciate as a GCSE student. The miniseries gave her a sense of conviction in her career path, stating ahead of the broadcast in 2002: [...] "whatever the reason I do what I do, I felt I had come to a point where I could stop searching after this". Reviewing the serial Paul Hoggart of The Times wrote that Lancashire [...] "steals the show" [...] with a [...] "performance of immense subtlety and quiet strength, proof, if we still needed it, that she has matured into a terrific actress." [...] Conversely Andrew Billen, writing in New Statesman, wrote that [...] "Sarah Lancashire was no revelation at all", purely because she had [...] "long since proved herself a formidable actress".|$|E
