40|$|Historically, {{fair market}} values for {{commercial}} aircraft {{appear to have}} patterns {{similar to those of}} commodity markets, fluctuating in a cyclical nature, following supply and demand factors. These are influenced by airline profits, economic indicators, and personal income, to name a few. As expressed by professional aircraft value appraisers, this recurring instability in commercial <b>aircraft</b> <b>market</b> value rates cannot be attributed to one major influencing factor, but is impacted by a dynamic market of several sources. To provide additional insight into this complex and often chaotic pricing nature, this study explored market indices and commodity prices for distinguishable correlations to commercial <b>aircraft</b> <b>market</b> values. Additional analysis was conducted to identify possible 2 ̆ 2 lag time 2 ̆ 2 of commodity correlations to <b>aircraft</b> <b>market</b> value, providing information for consideration in determining possible <b>aircraft</b> <b>market</b> value rates in the future. This analysis could provide supplementary information for investors, aircraft manufactures, and leasing firms in studying <b>aircraft</b> <b>market</b> values. ...|$|R
