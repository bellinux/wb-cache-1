5|$|When Brian advises Stewie to “wait and see” {{whether or}} not he has cancer, Stewie says “Jim Henson had a wait and see attitude, <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>what</b> {{happened}} to him. Now we’ve got wrong-sounding Muppets,” a reference to Henson’s deadly Streptococcus pneumoniae infection that was discovered too late which led to his death in 1990. The scene then cuts to Kermit the Frog and the Swedish Chef in a dialogue sequence, with much different voice tones. The two would later appear {{at the end of the}} show, discussing the preceding events, when Fozzie Bear walks in, and says in a deep voice (supplied by actor Michael Clarke Duncan): “Wocka wocka. Who wants to hear a funny-ass joke?”.|$|E
25|$|The Jews {{damn near}} owned all of Germany {{prior to the}} war. That's why Hitler came in. He {{was going to make}} damn sure that the Jews didn't take over Germany, or even Europe. That's why he fried six million of those guys, you know. Jews would have owned the goddamned world. <b>And</b> <b>look</b> <b>what</b> they're doing now, they're killing people in Arab countries.|$|E
500|$|On December 21, 1970, Presley {{engineered}} {{a meeting}} with President Richard Nixon at the White House, where he expressed his patriotism and his contempt for the hippies, the growing drug culture, and the counterculture in general. He asked Nixon for a Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs badge, to add to similar items he had begun collecting and to signify official sanction of his patriotic efforts. Nixon, who apparently found the encounter awkward, expressed a belief that Presley could send a positive message to young people {{and that it was}} therefore important he [...] "retain his credibility". Presley told Nixon that the Beatles, whose songs he regularly performed in concert during the era, exemplified what he saw as a trend of anti-Americanism and drug abuse in popular culture. On hearing reports of the meeting, Paul McCartney later said he [...] "felt a bit betrayed" [...] and commented: [...] "The great joke was that we were taking [...] drugs, <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>what</b> happened to him", a reference to Presley's death, hastened by prescription drug abuse.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{when she}} was {{president}} of her royal college she made controversial comments about women in medicine, suggesting that the profession was [...] being [...] "feminised" [...] and that this could {{make it harder to}} find specialists such as cardiologists in the future. To illustrate her concerns, she said that Russian doctors were poorly paid and had low status and that this was the result of having an almost entirely female workforce (rather than it being a reflection of Russian 20th century political history). She then drew a parallel between doctors and teachers, saying: [...] "Years ago, teaching was a male-dominated profession - <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>what</b> happened to teaching". She later clarified her comments, explaining that her intention had been to warn that unless provision was made for female doctors to balance work and family life and be given extra support with childcare and flexible hours, they would tend not to enter what she called [...] "the more demanding" [...] branches of medicine or to serve on government committees.|$|E

We {{examined}} the effect of brief exposure to consistent facial distortions on <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> normal (average) <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> at-tractive.

6000|$|... "Yes, sir," [...] {{answered}} Mrs. Peckover, glancing indignantly at {{the broken}} {{board and the}} mud and brambles all about it.

60|$|Paul {{was waiting}} on the Noel's Cove rocks for Miss Trevor the next afternoon. He was not alone; a tall man, with a lined, strong-featured face and a grey beard, was with him. The man was clad in a rough suit <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>what</b> he was, a 'longshore fisherman. But he had deep-set, kindly eyes, and Miss Trevor liked his face. He moved {{off to one side}} when she came and stood there for a little, {{apparently}} gazing out to sea, while Paul and Miss Trevor talked. Then he walked away up the cove and disappeared in his little grey house.|$|R

60|$|Of {{the losses}} we as yet know nothing, except that Lord Ava is seriously wounded, a sad item {{for which the}} only {{consolation}} is that the Empire is worth the blood of its noblest citizens.

A little reproachfully, perhaps; for it is dull work fighting week after week without alcohol or green vegetables.|$|E

6000|$|Montague Nevitt, flurried {{and taken}} aback as he was, yet {{reflected}} vaguely with some wonder, {{as he listened}} <b>and</b> <b>looked,</b> <b>what</b> this sudden passion of disinterested zeal could betoken. Why such burning solicitude for Colonel Kelmscott's estate {{on the part of}} a man who was his avowed enemy? Even if Gwendoline meant to marry the young fellow Granville, with her father's consent, how could Nevitt himself levy blackmail upon Gilbert Gildersleeve by his knowledge of the two Warings' claim to the property? A complication surely. Was there not some unexpected intricacy here which the cunning schemer himself didn't yet understand, but which might redound, if unravelled, to his greater advantage? ...|$|R

60|$|This is {{not because}} Holbein cannot give chiaroscuro if he chooses. He is twenty times a {{stronger}} master of it than Rembrandt; but he, therefore, knows exactly {{when and how to}} use it; and that wood engraving is not the proper means for it. The quantity of it which is needful for his story, and will not, by any sensational violence, either divert, or vulgarly enforce, the attention, he will give; and that with an unrivaled subtlety. Therefore I must ask you {{for a moment or two}} to quit the subject of technics, <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>what</b> these two woodcuts mean.|$|E

After all, she was demeaning herself shamefully staying with them in common, sordid lodgings. After all, she had been bred up {{differently}} from that. They had horribly low standards--such low standards--not only of morality, but of life altogether. Really, she had come down in the world, conforming to such standards of life. She evoked the images {{of her mother and}} Miss Frost: ladies, and noble women both. Whatever could she be thinking of herself! ...|$|E
