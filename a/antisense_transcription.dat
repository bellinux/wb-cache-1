50|$|<b>Antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> might {{contribute}} to disease through chromosomal changes that result {{in the production of}} aberrant antisense transcripts. A documented case of cis-NATs being involved in human disease comes from an inherited form of α-thalassemia where there is silencing of the hemoglobin α-2 gene through the action of a cis-NAT. It is thought that in malignant cancer cells with activated transposable elements creates a large amount of transcriptional noise. It is likely that aberrant antisense RNA transcripts resulting from this transcriptional noise may cause stochastic methylation of CpG islands associated with oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. This inhibition would further progress the malignancy of the cells since they lose key regulator genes. By looking at upregulated antisense transcripts in tumor cells, researchers are able to look for more candidate tumor suppressor genes. Also, aberrant cis-NATs have been implicated in neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease.|$|E

Previous {{studies have}} primarily focused on <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> initiating upstream of genes. Here, we characterize promoter-proximal <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> downstream of gene transcription starts sites in human breast cancer cells, investigating the genomic context of downstream <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription.</b> We find extensive correlations between <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> and features {{associated with the}} chromatin environment at gene promoters. <b>Antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> downstream of promoters is widespread, with <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> initiation observed within 2 kb of 28 % of gene transcription start sites. <b>Antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> initiates between nucleosomes regularly positioned downstream of these promoters. The nucleosomes between gene and downstream <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> start sites carry histone modifications associated with active promoters, such as H 3 K 4 me 3 and H 3 K 27 ac. This region is bound by chromatin remodeling and histone modifying complexes including SWI/SNF subunits and HDACs, suggesting that <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> or resulting RNA transcripts contribute to the creation and maintenance of a promoter-associated chromatin environment. Downstream <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> overlays additional regulatory features, such as transcription factor binding, DNA accessibility, and the downstream edge of promoter-associated CpG islands.

TAFs {{have also been}} recently found to enhance <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> from the 32 ̆ 7 end of the GAL 10 coding sequence. However, it remains unknown whether, like sense transcription of the ribosomal protein genes, TAF-dependent <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> of GAL 10 also requires NuA 4 KAT. Here, we show that NuA 4 KAT associates with the GAL 10 <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> initiation site at the 32 ̆ 7 end of the coding sequence. Such association of NuA 4 KAT depends on the Reb 1 p-binding site that recruits Reb 1 p activator to the GAL 10 <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> initiation site. Targeted recruitment of NuA 4 KAT to the GAL 10 <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> initiation site promotes GAL 10 <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription.</b> Like NuA 4 KAT, histone H 3 K 4 / 36 methyltransferases and histone H 2 B ubiquitin conjugase facilitate GAL 10 <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription,</b> while the Swi/Snf and SAGA chromatin remodeling/modification factors are dispensable for antisense, but not sense, transcription of GAL 10.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of RNA targeted gene repression mechanisms are being discovered operating in mammalian cells. Antisense-RNA mediated silencing of CpG island-associated genes {{is not limited to}} imprinting and X inactivation, but can occur at autosomal non-imprinted loci leading to disease. An antisense silencing phenomenon observed in a patient with an inherited form of anaemia was recently recreated in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells, demonstrating that the silencing and methylation of the oppositely transcribed tissue specific alpha globin CpG island exclusively occurs in the presence of antisense RNA. The aim of this thesis is to use differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells to further characterise this silencing mechanism through analysis of the histone modifications associated with repression of the alpha globin gene upon differentiation, and to further define the developmental period in which repression is established. Also, the requirement for <b>antisense</b> RNA <b>transcription</b> through the alpha globin gene is examined through insertion of a transcriptional terminator to truncate <b>antisense</b> RNA <b>transcription.</b> The gene silencing mechanism is tested with other genes in place of the alpha globin gene to investigate whether repression is limited to the alpha globin gene or is also applicable to other tissue specific or ubiquitously expressed genes. Analysis of the tissue specific gene MYOD and the ubiquitously expressed gene UBC demonstrated that the silencing mechanism could effect other genes in a similar manner, though not all genes were susceptible to repression as the ubiquitously expressed gene ACTB remained unsilenced by antisense RNA expression. These observations establish that this silencing mechanism can play a more general role in repression, thereby suggesting its potential role as a constituent of the multivariate repressive pathways within the mammalian cell.

40|$|This PhD thesis can {{be divided}} into three {{distinct}} sections with the common objective of understanding how and to which extent <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> influences gene expression within the yeast S. cerevisiae genome.

40|$|Background: Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and solitary long {{terminal}} repeats (LTRs) have {{a significant}} antisense bias when located in gene introns, suggesting strong negative selective pressure on such elements oriented in the same transcriptional direction as the enclosing gene. It has been assumed that this bias reflects the presence of strong transcriptional regulatory signals within LTRs but little {{work has been done}} to investigate this phenomenon further. Results: In the analysis reported here, we found significant differences between individual human ERV families in their prevalence within genes and degree of antisense bias and show that, regardless of orientation, ERVs of most families {{are less likely to be}} found in introns than in intergenic regions. Examination of density profiles of ERVs across transcriptional units and the transcription signals present in the consensus ERVs suggests the importance of splice acceptor sites, in conjunction with splice donor and polyadenylation signals, as the major targets for selection against most families of ERVs/LTRs. Furthermore, analysis of annotated human mRNA splicing events involving ERV sequence revealed that the relatively young human ERVs (HERVs), HERV 9 and HERV-K (HML- 2), are involved in no human mRNA splicing events at all when oriented <b>antisense</b> to gene <b>transcription,</b> while elements in the sense direction in transcribed regions show considerable bias for use of strong splice sites. Conclusion: Our observations suggest suppression of splicing among young intronic ERVs oriented <b>antisense</b> to gene <b>transcription,</b> which may account for their reduced mutagenicity and higher fixation rate in gene introns...|$|R

After the collision, the plough pushes the smart car backwards, as it continues to travel forward. In the collision model for Ube3a/Ube3a-ATS, RNA polymerases (RNAPs) travel towards each other along the sense and <b>antisense</b> templates during <b>transcription.</b> The sense and antisense templates overlap for Ube3a and Ube3a-ATS. The two transcription bubbles will collide head-on, and the RNAP transcribing the Ube3a-ATS, being the plough, will push the RNAP transcribing the Ube3a (smart car), backwards and eventually off of the template. This prevents complete transcription of Ube3a.|$|R
40|$|X-chromosome {{inactivation}} (XCI) {{depends on}} the noncoding Xist gene. Xist transcription is negatively regulated by its antisense partner Tsix, whose disruption results in nonrandom XCI in females. However, males can maintain Xist in a repressed state without Tsix, indicating participation of additional factor(s) in {{the protection of the}} single male X from inactivation. Here, we provide evidence that the histone methyltransferase Eed is also involved in the process. Male embryonic stem cells with Eed-null and Tsix mutations (X ΔY Eed-/-) showed Xist hyperactivation upon differentiation, whereas cells with either mutation alone did not. Impaired X-linked gene expression was observed in the XΔY Eed-/- ES cells at the onset of differentiation. The Xist promoter in the XΔY Eed-/- cells showed elevated histone H 3 -dimethyl lysine 4 modifications and lowered CpG methylation, which are characteristics of open chromatin. Hence, we identified Eed as an additional major player in the regulation of Xist expression.

40|$|Background: Although {{genome-wide}} transcriptional {{analysis has}} been used for many years to study bacterial gene expression, many aspects of the bacterial transcriptome remain undefined. One example is <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription,</b> which has been observed in a number of bacteria, though the function of antisense transcripts, and their distribution across the bacterial genome, is still unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings: Single-stranded RNA-seq results revealed a widespread and non-random pattern of <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> covering more than two thirds of the B. anthracis genome. Our analysis revealed a variety of antisense structural patterns, suggesting multiple mechanisms of <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription.</b> The data revealed several instances of sense and antisense expression changes in different growth conditions, suggesting that <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> {{may play a role in}} the ways in which B. anthracis responds to its environment. Significantly, genome-wide antisense expression occurred at consistently higher levels on the lagging strand, while the leading strand showed very little antisense activity. Intrasample gene expression comparisons revealed a gene dosage effect in all growth conditions, where genes farthest from the origin showed the lowest overall range of expression for both sense and antisense directed transcription. Additionally, transcription from both strands was verified using a novel strand-specific assay.

40|$|Transcription lies at {{the centre}} of gene expression. In eukaryotes, {{transcription}} occurs not only at genes but also across the non-coding portion of the genome, an apparently pervasive process that {{gives rise to a}} wide array of different transcripts. In recent years, it has emerged that genes themselves are frequently subject to non-coding transcription of their antisense strand. This <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> is evident in eukaryotes from yeast to mammals; however its general genome-wide role, if indeed it has one, remains elusive. Here, the nature of <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is explored on a genome-wide scale. <b>Antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> is ubiquitous and often abundant, and appears to be driven by a promoter architecture at the 3 ’ end of genes, one which shows evidence of regulation, and which mirrors that found at the 5 ’ end. Furthermore, <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> shows evidence of changing gene behaviour. It is associated with a drastically altered chromatin environment at the 5 ’ promoter and across the gene body; however it is not associated with a change in the level of gene transcription itself. Rather, these chromatin changes appear to enforce a change in the mode of gene transcription, promoting rapid bursts of transcription re-initiation that result in noisier gene expression – a hitherto unknown role of <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription.</b> It is proposed that <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> represents a fundamental layer of gene regulation, and that it should be considered a canonical feature of eukaryotic genes.

Metatranscriptomics research provides an unprecedented opportunity to examine gene regulation for many microbial species simultaneously, and more importantly, for the majority that are unculturable microbial species, in their natural environments (or hosts). Current analyses of metatranscriptomic datasets focus on the detection of gene expression levels {{and the study of}} the relationship between changes of gene expression and changes of environment. As a demonstration of utilizing metatranscriptomics beyond these common analyses, we developed a computational and statistical procedure to analyze the antisense transcripts in strand-specific metatranscriptomic datasets. Antisense RNAs encoded on the DNA strand opposite a gene’s CDS have the potential to form extensive base-pairing interactions with the corresponding sense RNA, and can have important regulatory functions. Most studies of antisense RNAs in bacteria are rather recent, are mostly based on transcriptome analysis, and have been applied mainly to single bacterial species. Application of our approaches to human gut-associated metatranscriptomic datasets allowed us to survey <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> for a large number of bacterial species associated with human beings. The ratio of protein coding genes with <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> ranges from zero to 35. 8 % (median = 10. 0 %) among 47 species.

40|$|Transcription of DNA into RNA is an {{essential}} process occurring in all living organisms. In eukaryotes, transcription {{takes place in the}} nucleus. Recently eukaryotic transcription has been re-considered. First, new techniques such as NET-sequencing have shown that eukaryotic genomes are pervasively transcribed producing thousands of noncoding RNAs that most of the times have an uncharacterized function. Second, transcription is not seen solely as the act of producing mRNA but can also contribute to gene regulation. In particular, {{it has been shown that}} <b>antisense</b> (AS) <b>transcription</b> participates under certain circumstances in the control of gene expression. The aim of this study is to characterize AS-mediated gene regulation of highly regulated genes in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. At such loci, an AS transcription unit originates within the 3 'UTR of the gene and spans over the corresponding Sense (S) gene to reach the promoter. It is proposed that AS transcription may regulate S transcription possibly by recruiting histone deacetylase complexes that in turn silence the gene.

40|$|Regulated {{expression}} of the human beta-globin gene has been demonstrated in cultured murine erythroleukemia cells and in mice after retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. However, the low titer of recombinant viruses described to date results in relatively inefficient gene transfer, which limits their usefulness for animal studies and for potential gene therapy in humans for diseases involving defective beta-globin genes. We found regions that interfered with virus production within intron 2 of the beta-globin gene and {{on both sides of}} the gene. The flanking regions could be removed, but intron 2 was required for beta-globin expression. Inclusion of beta-globin introns necessitates an antisense orientation of the gene within the retrovirus vector. However, we found no effect of the <b>antisense</b> beta-globin <b>transcription</b> on virus production. A region downstream of the beta-globin gene that stimulates {{expression of}} the gene in transgenic mice was included in the viruses without detrimental effects on virus titer.

Oligonucleotide therapeutics, such as <b>antisense</b> or <b>Transcription</b> Factor Decoys (TFDs), {{have the potential to}} circumvent current resistance mechanisms by acting on novel targets. However, their full translation into clinical application requires efficient delivery strategies and fundamental comprehension of their interaction with target bacterial cells. To address these points, we employed a novel cationic bolaamphiphile that binds TFDs with high affinity to form self-assembled complexes (nanoplexes). Confocal microscopy revealed that nanoplexes efficiently transfect bacterial cells, consistently with biological efficacy on animal models. To understand the factors affecting the delivery process, liposomes with varying compositions, taken as model synthetic bilayers, were challenged with nanoplexes and investigated with Scattering and Fluorescence techniques. Thanks to the combination of results on bacteria and synthetic membrane models we demonstrate {{for the first time that}} the prokaryotic-enriched anionic lipid Cardiolipin (CL) plays a key-role in the TFDs delivery to bacteria. Moreover, we can hypothesize an overall TFD delivery mechanism, where bacterial membrane reorganization with permeability increase and release of the TFD from the nanoplexes are the main factors.

We took an expression-based approach to explore microRNA (miRNA) -related <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> by computational analyses of published whole-genome tiling microarray transcriptome and deep sequencing small RNA (smRNA) data. Statistical support for greater abundance of <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> signatures and smRNAs was observed for miRNA targets than for paralogous genes with no miRNA cleavage site. Antisense smRNAs {{were also found}} associated with MIRNA genes. This suggests that miRNA-associated "transitivity" (production of small interfering RNAs through <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription)</b> is more common than previously reported. High-resolution (3 nt) custom tiling microarray transcriptome analysis was performed with probes 400 bp 5 ' upstream and 3 ' downstream of the miRNA cleavage sites (direction relative to the mRNA) for 22 select miRNA target genes. We hybridized RNAs labeled from the smRNA pathway mutants, including hen 1 - 1, dcl 1 - 7, hyl 1 - 2, rdr 6 - 15, and sgs 3 - 14. Results showed that antisense transcripts associated with miRNA targets were mainly elevated in hen 1 - 1 and sgs 3 - 14 to a lesser extent, and somewhat reduced in dcl 11 - 7, hyl 11 - 2, or rdr 6 - 15 mutants. This was corroborated by semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR; however, a direct correlation of antisense transcript abundance in MIR 164 gene knockouts was not observed. Our overall analysis reveals a more widespread role for miRNA-associated transitivity with implications for functions of <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> in gene regulation.

Antisense {{transcripts}} are implicated in many aspects of gene regulation. Is there a functional connection between <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> and organismic complexity, that is, is antisense regulation especially prevalent in humans? We used the same robust protocol to identify antisense transcripts in humans and five other metazoan genomes (mouse, rat, chicken, fruit fly, and nematode), and found that the estimated proportions of genes involved in <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> are highly sensitive to the number of transcripts included in the analysis. By controlling for transcript abundance, we find that the probability that any given transcript is putatively involved in sense-antisense regulation is no higher in humans than in other vertebrates but appears unusually high in flies and especially low in nematodes. Similarly, {{there is no evidence that}} the proportion of sense-antisense transcripts is especially higher in humans than other vertebrates in a given subset of transcript sequences such as mRNAs, coding sequences, conserved, or nonconserved transcripts. Although <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> might be enriched in mammalian brains compared with nonbrain tissues, it is no more enriched in human brain than in mouse brain. Overall, therefore, while we see striking variation between multicellular animals in the abundance of antisense transcripts, there is no evidence for a link between <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> and organismic complexity. More particularly, we see no evidence that humans are in any way unusual among the vertebrates in this regard.

However, a central challenge to building more sophisticated RNA genetic circuitry is creating larger families of orthogonal attenuators that function independently of each other. Here, we overcome this challenge by developing a modular strategy to create chimeric fusions between the engineered transcriptional attenuator from plasmid pT 181 and natural antisense RNA translational regulators. Using in vivo gene expression assays in Escherichia coli, we demonstrate our ability to create chimeric attenuators by fusing se-quences from five different translational regulators. Mutagenesis of these functional attenuators allowed us to create a total of 11 new chimeric attenutaors. A comprehensive orthogonality test of these culminated in a 7 7 matrix of mutually or-thogonal regulators. A comparison between all chimeras tested led to design principles that will facilitate further engineering of orthogonal RNA transcription regulators, and may help elucidate general principles of non-coding RNA regulation.

At 24 h postinfection, both cellular and viral transcriptomes were analyzed by serial analysis of gene expression followed by high-throughput sequencing (SAGE-Seq). Read mapping resulted in 33 to 44 million tags aligning with the human transcriptome and 0. 23 to 0. 25 million tags aligning with the genome of the HIV- 1 vector. Thus, at peak infection, 1 transcript in 143 is of viral origin (0. 7 %), including a small component of <b>antisense</b> viral <b>transcription.</b> Of the detected cellular transcripts, 826 (2. 3 %) were differentially expressed between mock- and HIV-infected samples.

It is proposed that their mobility, activated under stress, induces mutations that could confer advantages {{to the host}} organism. Transcription of the Ty 1 LTR-retrotransposon of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is activated in response to a severe deficiency in adenylic nucleotides. Here, we show that Ty 2 and Ty 3 are also stimulated under these stress conditions, revealing the simultaneous activation of three active Ty retrotransposon families. We demonstrate that Ty 1 activation in response to adenylic nucleotide depletion requires the DNA-binding transcription factor Tye 7. Ty 1 is transcribed in both sense and antisense directions. We identify three Tye 7 potential binding sites in the region of Ty 1 DNA sequence where <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> starts. We show that Tye 7 binds to Ty 1 DNA and regulates Ty 1 <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription.</b> Altogether, our data suggest that, in response to adenylic nucleotide reduction, TYE 7 is induced and activates Ty 1 mRNA transcription, possibly by controlling Ty 1 <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription.</b> We also provide the first evidence that Ty 1 <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> can be regulated by environmental stress conditions, pointing to a new level of control of Ty 1 activity by stress, as Ty 1 antisense RNAs {{play an important role in}} regulating Ty 1 mobility at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional stages...|$|E

Using chemical inhibitors and small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdowns, we identified the ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated [ATM] and Rad 3 related) signaling pathway as a key mediator of this cellular response. RNA polymerase II, replication protein A (RPA), and components of the ATR signaling pathway accumulate at convergently transcribed repeat tracts, accompanied by phosphorylation of ATR, CHK 1, and p 53. Cell death depends on simultaneous sense and <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> and is proportional to their relative levels, it requires the presence of the repeat tract, and it occurs in both proliferating and nonproliferating cells. Convergent transcription through a CAG repeat represents a novel mechanism for triggering a cellular stress response, one that is initiated by events at a single locus in the genome and resembles the response to DNA damage...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} PNA to {{interact}} with DNA double stranded has been recently investigated. In a decoy approach these interactions are of great importance as may lead to inhibition of interactions of DNA sequences to specific transcription factors and may be employed as a strategy for the inhibition of gene transcription alternative to the <b>antisense</b> strategy (targeting <b>transcription</b> factors mRNAs) and the transcription factor decoy approach (targeting transcription factors). We explored the ability of PNA and PNAs with modified monomers to bind to DNA and to interfere {{in the formation of}} DNA/transcription factor complex. We report a procedure for the synthesis of Fmoc-gamma-hydroxymetyl PNA, the synthesis and CD analysis of PNA oligomers containing the modified monomer in different positions and EMSA assays to test the: (a) binding to double stranded DNA and (b) inhibition of DNA-protein interactions...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{identification}} of antisense RNA in the transcriptomes of many eukaryotes has generated enormous interest. The presence of antisense RNA in Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of severe malaria, remains controversial. Elucidation of {{the mechanism of}} antisense RNA in P. falciparum synthesis is critical in order to demonstrate the origin and function of these transcripts. Therefore, a systematic analysis of antisense and sense RNA synthesis was performed using direct labeling experiments. Nuclear run on experiments with single-stranded DNA probes demonstrated that antisense RNA is synthesized in the nucleus at several genomic loci. Antisense RNA synthesis is sensitive to the potent RNA polymerase II inhibitor α-amanitin. <b>Antisense</b> and sense <b>transcription</b> was also detected in nuclei isolated from synchronized parasites, suggesting concurrent synthesis. In summary, our experiments directly demonstrate that antisense RNA synthesis is a common transcriptional phenomenon in P. falciparum, and is catalyzed by RNA polymerase II...|$|R
40|$|To decrypt the {{regulatory}} {{code of the}} genome, sequence elements must be defined that determine the kinetics of RNA metabolism and thus gene expression. Here, we attempt such decryption in an eukaryotic model organism, the fission yeast S. pombe. We first derive an improved genome annotation that redefines borders of 36 % of expressed mRNAs and adds 487 non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). We then combine RNA labeling in vivo with mathematical modeling to obtain rates of RNA synthesis and degradation for 5, 484 expressed RNAs and splicing rates for 4, 958 introns. We identify functional sequence elements in DNA and RNA that control RNA metabolic rates and quantify the contributions of individual nucleotides to RNA synthesis, splicing, and degradation. Our approach reveals distinct kinetics of mRNA and ncRNA metabolism, separates <b>antisense</b> regulation by <b>transcription</b> interference from RNA interference, and provides a general tool for studying {{the regulatory}} code of genomes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHistone H 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H 3 K 4 me 3) is {{well known}} {{to occur in the}} {{promoter}} region of genes for transcription activation. However, when investigating the H 3 K 4 me 3 profiles in the mouse cerebrum and testis, we discovered that H 3 K 4 me 3 also has a significant enrichment at the 3 ′ end of actively transcribed (sense) genes, named as 3 ′-H 3 K 4 me 3. 3 ′-H 3 K 4 me 3 is associated with ∼ 15 % of protein-coding genes in both tissues. In addition, we examined the transcriptional initiation signals including RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) binding sites and 5 ′-CAGE-tag that marks transcriptional start sites. Interestingly, we found that 3 ′-H 3 K 4 me 3 is associated with the initiation of <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription.</b> Furthermore, 3 ′-H 3 K 4 me 3 modification levels correlate positively with the antisense expression levels of the associated sense genes, implying that 3 ′-H 3 K 4 me 3 is involved in the activation of <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription.</b> Taken together, our findings suggest that H 3 K 4 me 3 may be involved in the regulation of <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> that initiates from the 3 ′ end of sense genes. In addition, a positive correlation was also observed between the expression of antisense and the associated sense genes with 3 ′-H 3 K 4 me 3 modification. More importantly, we observed the 3 ′-H 3 K 4 me 3 enrichment among genes in human, fruitfly and Arabidopsis, and found that the sequences of 3 ′-H 3 K 4 me 3 -marked regions are highly conserved and essentially indistinguishable from known promoters in vertebrate. Therefore, we speculate that these 3 ′-H 3 K 4 me 3 -marked regions may serve as potential promoters for <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> and 3 ′-H 3 K 4 me 3 appear to be a universal epigenetic feature in eukaryotes. Our results provide a novel insight into the epigenetic roles of H 3 K 4 me 3 and the regulatory mechanism of <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription...</b>|$|E

Yet, the production of regulatory retroviral proteins from antisense-encoded viral genes is gaining research attention, due to their clinical significance. This report will discuss {{what is known about}} <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> in Retroviridae, and provide new information about antisense transcriptional regulation through a comparison of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Human T-cell Lymphotrophic Virus (HTLV- 1) and endogenous retrovirus-K (ERVK) long terminal repeats (LTRs).

40|$|<b>Antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> (transcription {{from the}} {{opposite}} strand to a protein-coding or sense strand) has been ascribed roles in gene regulation involving degradation of the corresponding sense transcripts (RNA interference), as well as gene silencing at the chromatin level. Global transcriptome analysis provides evidence that {{a large proportion of}} the genome can produce transcripts from both strands, and that antisense transcripts commonly link neighboring "genes" in complex loci into chains of linked transcriptional units. Expression profiling reveals frequent concordant regulation of sense/antisense pairs. We present experimental evidence that perturbation of an antisense RNA can alter the expression of sense messenger RNAs, suggesting that <b>antisense</b> <b>transcription</b> contributes to control of transcriptional outputs in mammals.

40|$|The Clostridium acetobutylicum {{glutamine}} synthetase (GS) DNA {{region is}} characterized by a downstream promoter, P 3, oriented toward the glnA gene, which controls the transcription of an RNA complementary {{to the start of the}} glnA mRNA. Expression of the predicted 43 -base antisense RNA was demonstrated in C. acetobutylicum and Escherichia coli cells containing the cloned glnA DNA. <b>Antisense</b> RNA <b>transcription</b> from P 3 was not regulated by nitrogen in E. coli cells, but the expression of antisense RNA was associated with decreased levels of GS activity. In C. acetobutylicum, GS activity and the transcription of glnA mRNA and antisense RNA were regulated by nitrogen. GS activity and glnA mRNA were repressed in cells grown in nitrogen-rich medium. Repression ratios for GS activity varied from 1. 6 to 9. 0, depending on the sampling time. The relative number of glnA transcripts was approximately 25 % lower in cells grown for 72 h in nitrogen-rich medium than in cells grown in nitrogen-limiting medium. This finding contrasted with the expression of antisense RNA, which was repressed in nitrogen-limiting medium but induced in nitrogen-rich medium. The relative number of antisense RNA transcripts was increased approximately sixfold in cells grown in nitrogen-rich medium. There was a 1. 6 -fold excess of antisense RNA over glnA mRNA under conditions that repressed GS activity. Under conditions that induced GS activity, glnA mRNA transcripts exceeded antisense RNA transcripts by fivefold...|$|R

Novel approaches and new technology has revealed an unprecedented level of inherent complexity in the mammalian transcriptome. Here, the majority of nucleotides are expressed, {{in sharp contrast to}} the ∼ 1. 2 % of the human genome harboring protein coding information. Also, > 50 % of genomic loci contain <b>antisense</b> and interleaved <b>transcription,</b> a conservative estimate since non-coding RNA is highly regulated between tissues and developmental stages, which has only been investigated to a limited extent. Subsequent focus on RNA with no coding potential has revealed numerous species with novel functions, and deep sequencing studies imply that many remain to be discovered. This review gives an overview of the plasticity and dynamics of the mammalian transcriptome and the prevailing interpretation of its effect on the complexity of species...|$|R
40|$|Hypoxic {{induction}} of {{the early}} growth response- 1 (Egr- 1) transcription factor initiates proinflammatory and procoagulant gene expression. Orthotopic/isogeneic rat lung transplantation triggers Egr- 1 expression and nuclear DNA binding activity corresponding to Egr- 1, which leads to increased expression of downstream target genes such as interleukin- 1 β, tissue factor, and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1. The devastating functional consequences of Egr- 1 up-regulation in this setting are prevented by treating donor lungs with a phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide directed against the Egr- 1 translation initiation site, which blocks expression of Egr- 1 and its gene targets. Post-transplant graft leukostasis, inflammation, and thrombosis are consequently diminished, with marked improvement in graft function and recipient survival. Blocking expression of a proximal transcription factor, which activates deleterious inflammatory and coagulant effector mechanisms, is an effective molecular strategy to improve organ preservation.
