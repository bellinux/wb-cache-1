40|$|We report {{engineering}} experiences {{from the}} critical task of relief well installation under high <b>artesian</b> <b>flow</b> {{conditions at the}} downstream toe of the Karkheh earth dam, Iran. Due {{to the establishment of}} excessive uplift pressure at the downstream toe of the Karkheh dam, installation of a series of new relief wells was considered to permanently relieve part of these pressures. The mentioned uplift pressure, as high as around 30 m above the ground level, was produced in a confined conglomerate aquifer bounded above and below by relatively impervious mudstone layers which reduced the safety factor of the dam toe to below 1. 0. Investigations on the shortcomings of the old relief wells installed at the dam site showed that the main problems were: insufficient well numbers, insufficient well diameters, irregular well screens causing their blockage by time passing, and insufficient total opening area. Despite engineering difficulties and associated risk of downstream toe instability, installation of new relief wells was successfully completed under high <b>artesian</b> <b>flow</b> conditions ” was successfully completed. The employed technique for the construction of the new relief wells under <b>flowing</b> <b>artesian</b> conditions was based on: 1) cement grouting and casing of the well, 2) telescopic drilling, 3) application of appropriate drilling fluid, and 4) controlling the <b>artesian</b> <b>flow</b> by adding a long vertical pipe {{to the top of the}} relief wells. Numerical modeling of seepage for the Karkheh dam foundation showed that, as a result of the installation of the new relief wells, the safety factor of the downstream toe increased to the safe value of 1. 3 for the normal reservoir water level...|$|R

40|$|Snow samples {{collected}} from hand-dug pits at two sites in Simcoe County, Ontario, Canada were analysed for major and trace elements using the clean lab methods established for polar ice. Potentially toxic, chalcophile elements are highly enriched in snow, {{relative to their}} natural abundance in crustal rocks, with enrichment factor (EF) values (calculated using Sc) in the range 107 to 1081 for Ag, As, Bi, Cd, Cu, Mo, Pb, Sb, Te, and Zn. Relative to M/Sc ratios in snow, water samples collected at two <b>artesian</b> <b>flows</b> in this <b>area</b> are significantly depleted in Ag, Al, Be, Bi, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Sb, Tl, V, and Zn at both sites, and in Co, Th and Tl {{at one of the}} sites. The removal from the waters of these elements is presumably due to such processes as physical retention (filtration) of metal-bearing atmospheric aerosols by organic and mineral soil components as well as adsorption and surface complexation of ionic species onto organic, metal oxyhydroxide and clay mineral surfaces. In the case of Pb, the removal processes are so effective that apparently ''natural'' ratios of Pb to Sc are found in the groundwaters. Tritium measurements show that the groundwater at one of the sites is modern (ie not more than 30 years old) meaning that the inputs of Pb and other trace elements to the groundwaters may originally have been much higher than they are today; the M/Sc ratios measured in the groundwaters today, therefore, represent a conservative estimate of the extent of metal removal along the flow path. Lithogenic elements significantly enriched in the groundwaters at both sites include Ba, Ca, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, Rb, S, Si, Sr, and Ti. The abundance of these elements can largely be explained in terms of weathering of the dominant silicate (plagioclase, potassium feldspar, amphibole and biotite) and carbonate minerals (calcite, dolomite and ankerite) in the soils and sediments of the watershed. Arsenic, Mo, Te, and especially U are also highly enriched in the groundwaters, due to chemical weathering: these could easily be explained if there are small amounts of sulfides (As, Mo, Te) and apatite (U) in the soils of the source area. Elements neither significantly enriched nor depleted at both sites include Fe, Ga, Ge, and P...|$|R

40|$|Three {{processes}} successively predominate in enlarging original fractures within limestone into cavern passages: (1) early dissolving by acid {{produced by}} oxidizing reactions within the groundwater as it {{flows through the}} limestone; (2) dissolving caused by the initial undersaturation with respect to calcite of the groundwater when it enters the limestone; and (3) increased dissolving which occurs at the transition from laminar to turbulent groundwater flow. Only those original fractures in limestone which are widest and which have a high hydraulic gradient acting across them will be enlarged into cavern passages. Until all available surface drainage has been diverted underground, cavern development takes place under a constant hydraulic head, {{and the rate of}} limestone solution increases with time. After all available surface drainage has been diverted underground, the discharge through the cave, rather than the hydraulic head, remains constant, and the rate of limestone solution decreases toward a constant value.

The artesian groundwater is generally a very good source of drinking water, because of the purification properties of the soils; it is also used for irrigation, and, where surface water is scarce, for industrial purposes. A large quantity of discharge from an aquifer produces a reduction in water pressure and therefore, at the same time, an increase in the effective stress in the soil skeleton of the porous medium. The latter produces land subsidence (or consolidation) and sea water may infiltrate into artesian groundwater.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] The {{idea that}} blood {{passes through the}} left {{ventricular}} outflow tract with a flat velocity profile has recently been questioned. OBJECTIVE [...] To construct flow velocity profiles by magnetic resonance imaging over the whole cross sectional subaortic <b>flow</b> <b>area</b> in normal subjects. SUBJECTS [...] Nine people without heart disease aged 25 to 56. DESIGN [...] Cardiac gated cine magnetic resonance images were produced with a 1. 0 T magnet perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the left ventricular outflow tract 0. 5 to 1. 0 cm below the aortic annulus in mid-systole. Velocity was encoded every 30 - 40 ms throughout systole {{in the direction of}} flow perpendicular to the image plane. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Systolic velocity-time curves reconstructed in nine different regions (area of each circle 0. 2 cm 2) of the subaortic <b>flow</b> <b>area.</b> The systolic peak velocity and the mean flow rate were taken as indices of regional flow. RESULTS [...] The spatial inhomogeneity of the peak velocity, calculated as the percentage ratio of the range of the regional measurements to their mean, averaged 18. 2 % (5. 0 %), and the inhomogeneity of the mean flow rate was 19. 2 % (3. 5 %).

40|$|Abstract. In northwestern Pennsylvania (USA), {{numerous}} abandoned {{natural gas}} wells are producing <b>artesian</b> <b>flows</b> of Fe-contaminated water. The {{origin of the}} polluted water has been generally assumed to be brines from the gas-producing sands. We sampled 20 artesian discharges where iron staining was conspicuous. The waters were not brines, but were more characteristic of acid mine drainage (AMD). The dominant cations were Fe, Ca, and Mg, while the dominant anion was sulfate. The study area {{has a long history}} of coal mining in the lower Allegheny formation; however, the coal beds are generally at higher elevations than the discharges. We propose that AMD formed in the coal mines is infiltrating into lower aquifers, moving outside the lateral limits of mining, and using abandoned gas wells as conduits to the surface. While flowing through the underlying sandstones, the AMD chemistry is modified by contact with siderite, the dominant carbonate mineral in this stratigraphy. This would suggest that current remediation strategies that emphasize plugging the pollution-producing gas wells may be ill-advised because the source of the polluted water is more shallow than currently assumed.

40|$|The {{issue of}} natural and forced {{groundwater}} movements, {{and its effect on}} the performance of ground heat exchangers is of great importance for the design and sizing of borehole thermal energy systems (BTESs). In Scandinavia groundwater filled boreholes in hard rock are commonly used. In such boreholes one or more intersecting fractures provide a path for groundwater flow between the borehole and the surrounding rock. An enhanced heat transport then occurs due to the induced convective water flow, driven by the volumetric expansion of heated water. Warm groundwater leaves through fractures in {{the upper part of the}} borehole while groundwater of ambient temperature enters the borehole through fractures at larger depths. This temperature driven flow is referred to as thermosiphon, and may cause considerable increase in the heat transport from groundwater filled boreholes. The thermosiphon effect is connected to thermal response tests, where the effective ground thermal conductivity is enhanced by this convective transport. Strong thermosiphon effects have frequently been observed in field measurements. The character of this effect is similar to that of <b>artesian</b> <b>flow</b> through boreholes.
