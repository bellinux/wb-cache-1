5|$|LDLR {{mutations}} <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> {{in certain}} populations, presumably {{because of a}} genetic phenomenon known as the founder effect—they were founded by {{a small group of}} individuals, one or several of whom was a carrier of the mutation. The Afrikaner, French Canadians, Lebanese Christians, and Finns have high rates of specific mutations that make FH particularly common in these groups. APOB mutations <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in Central Europe.|$|E

5|$|Like other mouse lemurs, {{the gray}} mouse lemur uses {{what has been}} {{described}} as a harmonic whistle call that is lower in frequency and shorter in duration than its close relative, the brown mouse lemur. In addition, it has been found that the types of vocalizations emitted by the gray mouse lemur can be dependent upon the environment. In the more open dry forest habitats favored by the gray mouse lemur, trill calls <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> and effective since they carry faster and are less likely to be masked by the wind, while chirp calls <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in the brown mouse lemur, which favors closed rain forest habitats.|$|E
5|$|Strep throat is {{a common}} {{bacterial}} infection in children. It {{is the cause of}} 15–40% of sore throats among children and 5–15% among adults.

5|$|Attacks may {{be brought}} on by {{physical}} exertion, drinking alcohol, or eating food high in carbohydrates or salt. This may explain why attacks <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> in summer, when more people drink sugary drinks and engage in exercise. Exercise-related attacks tend to occur {{during a period of}} rest immediately after exercise; exercise may therefore be recommended to abort an attack.|$|E

5|$|S-type (silicate-rich) asteroids <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>common</b> {{toward the}} inner {{region of the}} belt, within 2.5 AU of the Sun. The spectra of their {{surfaces}} reveal the presence of silicates and some metal, but no significant carbonaceous compounds. This indicates that their materials have been significantly modified from their primordial composition, probably through melting and reformation. They have a relatively high albedo, and form about 17% of the total asteroid population.|$|E
