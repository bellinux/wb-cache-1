40|$|We {{examined}} how {{the exposure to}} secondary stressors affected the functional and compositional responses of microbial communities along two metal pollution gradients in Polish forests and whether responses were influenced by the level of metal pollution. Basal respiration rate and community composition, as determined by 16 S rRNA gene-based denaturing gradient analysis, were studied in laboratory-incubated microcosms, containing soil samples taken from different locations in the field gradients, and subjected to secondary stress factors (<b>arsenic,</b> <b>salt,</b> benzo[a]pyrene or flooding). Soils adapted to higher metal contamination levels were more resistant to arsenic and salt stress compared to less polluted soils, indicating that functional and compositional responses to these stresses {{were related to the}} level of historical pollution in the long-term contaminated forest soils. However, community composition and functioning in soils along the two gradients were resistant to benzo[a]pyrene and flooding stress. Changes in respiration were significantly related to changes in community composition. Knowledge on the functional gene capabilities prior to adding the secondary stressor benefitted understanding the functional responses toward additional stressors. Our study highlights that microbial communities selected for metal resistance in the field might also become more resistant against some secondary stress factors; however, the type of stress and the level of historical pollution play a decisive role in community-level responses toward secondary stressors...|$|E

40|$|The bottom {{dwelling}} air-breathing catfish, Clarias batrachus (Linn.) also respires via {{its skin}} (an accessory water-breathing organ). Prolonged (90 days) exposure to disodium arsenate heptahydrate has caused massive damage (e. g. {{wear and tear}} of various cellular components including club cells, hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the goblet mucous cells, altered staining and the slimy secretion) to the epidermis of its skin. The present study investigated the recovery in architecture of the damaged epidermis following return of the 90 days disodium arsenate heptahydrate exposed fish to clean water. The significant regeneration of its different cellular components (epithelial cells, Club cells, Mucous cells) took place after 24 h of withdrawal when sloughing; wear and tear and other damages of the epidermis of the skin got substantially reduced. The histopathological alterations which still continued included squeezing out of contents of the Club cells that formed a thin layer on the body surface. Regeneration of the Club cells continued throughout the epidermis even though the newly formed Club cells still showed massive sign of degeneration. Altered staining behaviour and hyperactivity of the Mucous cells continues even after prolonged withdrawal of {{the stress of the}} <b>arsenic</b> <b>salt.</b> Similarly the glycoproteins of the slime secreted by the mucous cells retained their sulphate moieties.

40|$|Population growth, {{urbanization}} {{and global}} climate change have increased urban and agricultural water demands, stressing aquifer systems where groundwater {{is a source of}} water supply. The availability and utility of groundwater may further be threatened by factors stressing the quality of groundwater, such as industrial and domestic wastes and agricultural intensification. Consequences include, for example, over-allocation of groundwater, groundwater overdraft, declining well yields and land subsidence; degraded groundwater quality due to mobilization of natural pollutants (<b>arsenic),</b> <b>salt</b> contamination caused by seawater intrusion; increased demand for conjunctively used surface water, and resulting conflicts with junior users; and streamflow capture and resulting damage to ecosystems. These consequences may occur incrementally and inequitably across an aquifer. Natural environmental problems can further complicate use of groundwater and increase strain on the aquifer system; for example, underground structures, geothermal heating (such as heat islands), and geochemical evolution (such as karst formation, excessive salinity, acidity, fluoride, radioactivity, hardness, or turbidity). To address this issue, a joint symposium on the Trends and Sustainability of Groundwater in Highly Stressed Aquifers was held during the 8 th Scientific Assembly of the International Association of Hydrological Sciences, IAHS, and the 37 th Congress of the International Association of Hydrogeology, IAH, in Hyderabad, India, September 2009. The symposium was organized by the IAHS International Commission on Groundwater (ICGW), supported IAH and by the IAHS International Commission on Water Quality (ICWQ). This symposium brought together scientists, including modellers, geochemists and hydro-geologists, with water supply managers and policy makers to discuss scientific and management ideas and approaches for improving the sustainability of highly stressed aquifers.

However, {{little is known about}} the degree of protection each offers to the other from different types of environmental stress. Our current study focused on the changes in response to toxic arsenic in the presence of an endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica that colonizes the paddy roots. The primary impact of arsenic was observed in the form of hyper-colonization of fungus in the host root and resulted in the recovery of its overall biomass, root damage, and chlorophyll due to arsenic toxicity. Further, fungal colonization leads to balance the redox status of the cell by adjusting the antioxidative enzyme system which in turn protects photosynthetic machinery of the plant from arsenic stress. We observed that fungus has ability to immobilize soluble arsenic and interestingly, it was also observed that fungal colonization restricts most of arsenic in the colonized root while a small fraction of it translocated to shoot of colonized plants. Our study suggests that P. indica protects the paddy (Oryza sativa) from arsenic toxicity by three different mechanisms viz. reducing the availability of free arsenic in the plant environment, bio-transformation of the toxic <b>arsenic</b> <b>salts</b> into insoluble particulate matter and modulating the antioxidative system of the host cell...|$|R

40|$|Phytoremediation {{is defined}} as {{cleaning}} up of pollutants mediated primarily by plants. It is an emerging technology for environmental remediation that offers a low-cost technique suitable for use against different types of contaminants {{in a variety of}} media. Phytoremediation is potentially applicable to a diversity of substances, involving hyperaccumulators heavy metals and radionuclides. It is also applicable to other inorganic contaminants such as <b>arsenic,</b> various <b>salts</b> and nutrients, and a variety of organic contaminants, including explosives, petroleum hydrocarbons and pesticides. At least there are one taxon of plant as hyperaccumulator for Cd, 28 taxa for Co, 37 taxa for Cu, 9 taxa for Mg, 317 taxa for Ni, and 11 taxa for Zn. Extensive progress were done in characterizing physiology of plants which hyperaccumulate or hypertolerate metals. Hypertolerance is fundamental to hyperaccumulator, and high rates of uptake and translocation are observed in hyperaccumulator plants. Hyperaccumulator plants and agronomic technology were undertaken to improve the annual rate of phytoextraction and to allow recycling of soil toxic metals accumulated in plant biomass. These techniques are very likely to support commercial environmental remediation.

HPLC fingerprintings were constructed for quality control of the Radix Rubiae extract using mollugin as the chemical marker. Further phytochemical study found that ethyl acetate fraction of this herb possessed potent growth inhibition on HaCaT cells, with IC 50 of 0. 9 microg/ml. However, the chemical compounds obtained from commercial sources including mollugin, alizarin, purpurin, and quinizarin failed to induce growth inhibition. Meanwhile, arsenic trioxide, arsenic pentoxide and arsenic iodide, three <b>arsenic</b> <b>salts</b> presented in realgar, had significant anti-proliferative effect on HaCaT cells, with IC 50 values of 2. 4, 16 and 6. 8 microM, respectively; and cellular apoptosis {{was found to be}} the underlying mechanism for the observed growth inhibitory activity. Furthermore, Radix Rubiae, realgar and arsenic compounds were also revealed to possess growth inhibition when evaluated in a PHA-activated PBMC model, and all of the substances except arsenic pentoxide significantly attenuated the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-y, TNF-alpha and IL- 2 in PBMC, indicating an anti-inflammatory effect. The in vivo mouse tail model experiments demonstrated that arsenic trioxide, arsenic pentoxide and arsenic iodide were able to markedly induce mouse tail keratinocyte differentiation, while such differentiation-modulating effect observed in the fraction of Radix Rubiae was only marginal. In summary, Radix Rubiae and realgar extracts and three arsenic compounds have been identified and characterized as potential anti-psoriatic agents. The discoveries from the present PhD project not only help put the traditional use of these medicinal substances for psoriasis treatment on a scientific footing, but also open up new opportunities for their development into novel anti-psoriatic therapies. Psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin disorder affecting approximately 2 - 3 % of the population worldwide, is characterized histologically by hyperproliferation and aberrant differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes. Many conventional therapies are offered for psoriasis treatment but there exist problems such as unsatisfactory efficacy, side effects and drug resistance. Many patients therefore turn to alternative and complementary medicines for help. Traditionally, Chinese herbal medicine has been extensively used to treat psoriasis and produced promising clinical results. The present PhD study was conducted to investigate psoriasis-treating Chinese herbal medicines with an aim to identify effective anti-psoriatic agents. Sixty Chinese medicinal materials were selected for the screening project based on their ethnomedical use in psoriasis. The ethanolic extracts of these medicinal substances were evaluated for their anti-proliferative action on cultured HaCaT human keratinocytes using microplate SRB and MTT assays. Among them, the root of Rubia cordifolia L. (Radix Rubiae) and realgar were found to have significant anti-proliferative effects, with IC 50 values of 1. 4 and 6. 6 microg/ml, respectively as measured by MTT assay, while they exerted mild significant cytotoxicity on the human fibroblast Hs- 68 cell line.

An assessment of both total As in rice and its bioavailability is crucial for estimating human exposure following dietary intake by the local community. Average As concentrations in each rice genotype ranged from 108 ± 4 μg/kg to 580 ± 6 μg/kg. Arsenic speciation shows that most of the rice genotype contains 73 to 100 % inorganic As. Swine were administered with As orally and via intravenous method, i. e. injection and fed certain common Bangladeshi rice genotypes (cooked). Swine blood As levels were measured to calculate As bioavailability from rice. Pilot studies shows that for As(III) and As(V), 90. 8 ± 12. 4 % and 85. 0 ± 19. 2 % of the administered oral dose was absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract whereas organic As was poorly absorbed resulting in low bioavailability values 20. 2 ± 2. 6 % (MMA) to 31. 2 ± 3. 4 % (DMA), respectively.

Museums today are faced with a tremendous task of identification and remediation {{of pesticides}} from artifacts in order to protect museum workers and the general public. In addition, artifacts are being repatriated by Native American tribes for use in cultural ceremonies which may subject the practitioner to health risks. <b>Arsenic</b> and mercury <b>salts</b> are among the pesticides that were used that are highly persistent and toxic. The primary challenge lies in removing these hazardous and persistent metals without damaging the materials or pigments on the objects. Concentrated aqueous alpha-lipoic acid solutions were developed for removing arsenic and mercury pesticides from materials commonly used in museum artifacts. The alpha-lipoic acid solutions were reduced using natural sunlight or laboratory ultraviolet lamps to enhance the binding of arsenic. The solubility of alpha-lipoic acid in various organic and inorganic solutions was determined and environmental parameters that impact the reduction and solubility, such as pH and temperature, were examined. The kinetics of the reaction of arsenic (III) with reduced lipoic acid was examined by varying the reduced lipoic acid, base and arsenic concentration as well as temperature and stirring conditions. The results indicated that the reaction occurs at a moderate rate primarily within 8 seconds in air. The reaction is chemically rate limited enhanced at higher temperatures and lower pH. Aerobic conditions significantly decreased the extent of the reaction with increased stirring rate. This impact was minimized by using a nitrogen environment or by limiting agitation during the reaction step. The methods developed were capable of removing up to 1000 Âµg/cm 2 arsenic (of sodium arsenite) from simulated artifacts to levels near the lower detection limit of the X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (1 Âµg/cm 2) without leaving detectable residues according to Attenuated Total-Reflection Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. Similar results were achieved in removing mercury (of mercuric chloride) from non-sulfur containing materials; however, the solutions and processes developed were not capable of removing mercury from sulfur-containing materials such as wool and feathers...|$|R
40|$|Recently a {{maintenance}} worker in Sweden {{was killed when}} climbing into a wood pole supporting an 11 -kV overhead line. The investigating done afterwards raised the suspicion that a current flowed through the pole was sufficient to kill a person. Due to a broken insulator one of the phases of the 11 -kV line had been resting on the metal crossbar. This accident triggered an investigation {{in order to determine}} if power line wood poles can conduct current and if so, whether this current can be sufficient to injure {{a maintenance}} worker climbing into the pole. The study has been made at the 11 kV level on a pole while a live wire was resting on the metal cross arm as would be the case if the insulator had broken. A proposal for a measuring method has been developed in order to determine under what conditions climbing should be prohibited. In Sweden the use of wood poles as part of 11 kV overhead lines is fairly common. A three phase system is used to distribute 11 kV, one wire for each phase, and the three wires are supported by insulators mounted on a horizontal metal (or wood) cross arm. The poles are treated with some kind of preservative to protect the wood from rot and insects. Three kinds of preservatives are commonly used in Sweden: <b>arsenic,</b> creosote and <b>salt.</b> In this study eight poles with different preservative and age varying from 50 years old to brand new have been examined in a realistic environment. The measurements presented in this paper support the earlier suspicion that a wood pole used for distributing power can conduct current if a fault occurs and a live wire comes in contact with the metal cross arm. It also shows that the current through a parallel, not connected to earth, resistor (i. e. a human climbing the pole) can reach potentially harmful amplitudes. Three main variables that affect the electrical characteristics of the pole have been identified: the preservation of the wood; the environmental temperature; and the humidity of the surroundings. There are however other variables that can {{have an impact on the}} conductivity of the pole for example how the pole was dried before preservation. Godkänd; 2010; 20100913 (ronsar...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Arsenic (As) is a {{carcinogenic}} metalloid {{that poses}} a significant {{health and environmental}} hazard. Geogenic As-contaminated groundwater {{has been reported in}} 150 countries of the world and its used for irrigation purposes for crops especially rice lead to As accumulation in paddy soils and further to elevated As contents in rice plants. Almost half of the world’s population depends on rice for a subsistence diet and it has been considered a significant pathway for human exposure to As. The As bioaccumulation by rice plants has been linked to a number of soil and environmental factors together with the rice genotypes, soil As loading, water and nutrient management practices in soils. The proposed research focuses on reducing As loading in different rice varieties and their bioavailability in relation to human health risk assessment under different management strategies. In this research household survey, market basket survey, pot and field experiments on rice genotypes were conducted to ascertain whether: firstly, soil As concentration, nutrient and water management practices affected rice As concentration and speciation; secondly, genetic variation accounts for uptake and their speciation and finally, the bioavailability of As from different rice genotypes can be employed in human health risk assessment and risk management decisions. An extensive number (965) of rice samples collected by household survey from 73 upazilas in Bangladesh was analyzed to determine regional variation, distribution and associated health risks from As in rice. Results showed that, the variation in As content was dominated by the location (47 % among the upazilas, 71 % among districts) and rice variety (14 %). The mean and median concentrations of total As were 126 µg/kg and 107 µg/kg, respectively, ranging between 3 – 680 µg/kg. Total As levels of aromatic rice were significantly lower than non-aromatic rice and varied with rice grain size. Coarse grain rice had the highest total As content followed by medium grain and fine grain rice. Irrigated rice had higher As content than the non-irrigated rice. Inorganic As content in rice grain ranged between 11 – 502 µg/kg (n= 162) with the highest fraction being 98. 6 %. The daily intake of inorganic As from rice ranged between 0. 38 to 1. 92 µg/kg BW in different districts. The incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) for individuals due to the consumption of rice varied between 0. 57 × 10 - 3 to 2. 88 × 10 - 3 in different districts, and 0. 54 × 10 - 3 to 2. 12 × 10 - 3 in different varieties, higher than the US EPA threshold. The highest average ILCR value of inorganic As for population in Narayanganj district was 2. 88 × 10 - 3 which was 288 times higher than the acceptable limit. The 2 - 10 years age group experiences higher carcinogenic risks than others and females are more susceptible than males. In a market survey study, fifty-nine rice and rice-based products available on sale in Australian supermarkets were collected for analysis of total and different As species to predict the potential health risk for children and adults. Results show that of the 59 rice-based products, 31 (53 %) exceeded the EU recommended value (100 µg/kg) of As for young children and 13 (22 %) samples had higher than maximum level of 200 µg/kg recommended for adults. Arsenic content varies as rice crackers>baby rice>rice cakes>puffed rice>other rice-based snacks>ready-to-eat rice. Of the 6 categories of rice-based products, except ready-to-eat rice, all others exceeded the EU recommended value for young children. Even manufacture recommended servings deliver significant amounts (0. 56 to 6. 87 µg) of inorganic As. In the field study, ten rice cultivars were evaluated at three locations of Bangladesh having different levels of soil As and irrigation water As to investigate the effect of continuous flooding (CF) and alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation practices on the bioaccumulation of As by rice plants. Results showed that As concentration in different parts of rice plants varied significantly with rice genotypes and irrigation practices. Higher grain As bioaccumulation was detected in plants in areas of high soil As in combination with CF irrigation practice. AWD irrigation practice with suitable genotypes resulted in 17 - 35 % reduction in grain As level with 7 - 38 % increase in grain yield compared to CF irrigation practice. This study advances the understanding that, for moderate to high levels of As contamination, the Binadhan- 5, Binadhan- 6, Binadhan- 8, Binadhan- 10 and BRRI dhan 47 varieties were quite promising to mitigate As induced human health risk. A greenhouse study was conducted to investigate the effect of water and fertilizer management on the bioaccumulation of As in rice plants under different As-graded paddy soils using an Australian rice variety (cv. Sherpa). Results showed that, arsenite accounted for > 80 % of the total inorganic As in pore water. AWD irrigation practice with Si fertilization significantly reduced the total As levels in pore water. The addition of As markedly increased the As concentration of grain and straw, with a concomitant reduction in grain and straw yields of rice. Lower levels of As in rice grains were found using AWD (93 µg/kg) than those observed in CF (121 µg/kg) irrigation practice. The addition of Si significantly decreased As uptake by rice plants while adding of P has no significant effect and this is also true for Si and P interaction. AWD irrigation practice with Si fertilization resulted in a reduction of grain As level at around 12 % to 21 %, while grain yield increased by 13 %. Arsenic contaminated rice poses a significant health risk to people. Therefore, assessing the bioavailability of As from rice is crucial for understanding human exposure and as a consequence {{to reduce the risk of}} As-related diseases. An in vivo assay using swine was used to measure the absolute bioavailability of As from cooked rice of twelve genotypes usually grown in Bangladesh. The average As concentrations in each rice genotype ranged from 108 ± 4 µg/kg to 580 ± 6 µg/kg. This study demonstrates that rice genotypic characters influenced As bioavailability varied between 25 % and 94 %. <b>Arsenic</b> in <b>salt</b> tolerant rice genotypes as well as brown rice genotypes has lower bioavailability compared to other rice genotypes. The most commonly cultivated and consumed variety (BRRI dhan 28) has As bioavailability of 70 %, which poses a significant risk to consumers...|$|R
