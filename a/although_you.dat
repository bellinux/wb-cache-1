25|$|In the United States, {{the most}} common places you will find women’s surfing would be California and Hawaii {{because they have the}} best {{conditions}} for surfing. <b>Although</b> <b>you</b> are able to surf in any place that has waves, surfing is mostly found all across the world from Peru, Australia, Indonesia, South Africa, France, Philippines, Ecuador, and anywhere else that has a shore and waves coming in. Although surfing can be found anywhere, {{there are a lot of}} things that affect the waves. Tide, time of day, storms miles off shore, and weather can all affect the strength of the waves.|$|E
25|$|The Artois Hound {{does not}} require a large amount of grooming. The Artois' smooth {{short-haired}} coat is easy to look after. Owners will simply want to make sure the coat is brushed on a consistent basis. These dogs should only be given baths when they need it. A wipe down with a damp towel should suffice for the bathing aspect, (<b>although</b> <b>you</b> should bathe it with mild soap only if or when necessary; you should also dry shampoo it occasionally), however a rubber, wire, or hard bristled brush would work best for the brushing aspect.The shedding patterns of these dogs are not known. Be sure to check the ears carefully for signs of infection. The nails of the D'Artois should also be trimmed, (particularly to avoid nail-born infections).|$|E

[...] "In the skewed world, they're washed out and faded. [...] Nothing is obvious, and it's only in the overall effect that these subtle differences will work their magic".|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} Invisible Circles {{was shaped by}} After Forever's singer and lyricist Floor Jansen, taking {{inspiration}} from Sander Gommans' job as an art teacher. His daily contact with children with social and family problems {{had given him the}} desire to make people aware of these problems by incorporating their stories into songs. He had also realized that those children's problems often stemmed from the psychological traumas that their parents had experienced in their past. Gommans described the title and the concept of the album in these terms: [...] "Invisible Circles describes the paths of life that someone can follow. Life consists of several circles that you can follow; many times you will come back {{at the beginning of a}} circle, <b>although</b> <b>you</b> have tried to get out of that particular circle." ...|$|E
500|$|In parallel, {{the concept}} that all men, whether Greek or barbarian, belonged to the same race was being {{developed}} by the Sophists and thus that certain men were slaves although they had {{the soul of a}} freeman and vice versa. Aristotle himself recognized this possibility and argued that slavery could not be imposed unless the master was better than the slave, in keeping with his theory of [...] "natural" [...] slavery. The Sophists concluded that true servitude was not a matter of status but a matter of spirit; thus, as Menander stated, [...] "be free in the mind, <b>although</b> <b>you</b> are slave: and thus you will no longer be a slave". This idea, repeated by the Stoics and the Epicurians, was not so much an opposition to slavery as a trivialization of it.|$|E
500|$|Outside of {{the battle}} system, GameSpot commented that the world map's [...] "sparsely {{detailed}} overhead view gives {{the impression of a}} board game, and you need to employ a puzzle-game mind-set to effectively use your limited pieces to clear the appropriate number of tiles. It's an interesting way to open up new places to explore, and it even ties in to the combat". Critics also praised the weapon customization system, [...] "the weapon upgrade system puts a unique spin on traditional standards. <b>Although</b> <b>you</b> do earn the occasional new gun, you spend more time enhancing your current firearm." [...] RPGamer gave the game its Most Original award, for presenting [...] "a gaming experience unlike any this past year", including a [...] "unique battle system" [...] emphasizing tactical combat, the strategic way in which [...] "the world map was opened up", the ability to [...] "modify almost every aspect of the characters' appearances", and [...] "the way that its story is told." [...] The game was the second runner-up for RPGamer's Best Console RPG and Most Overlooked awards.|$|E

500|$|Mark Bego, {{author of}} Madonna: Blonde Ambition wrote that [...] "Spotlight" [...] was a [...] "typical Madonna 'look-at-me' dance routine, that sounds flat besides the heavy remixes in You Can Dance." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic {{said that the}} song [...] "sounds dated—this is quite clearly {{extended}} mixes from the mid 80's—but that's part of the charm." [...] Dave Barry from The Miami Herald commented that <b>although</b> <b>You</b> Can Dance sounds like [...] "old Madonna", [...] "Spotlight" [...] sounds surprisingly fresh to his ears. Joe Brown from The Washington Post commented that the song {{should have been a}} [...] "flat reject". Don McLeese from Chicago Sun-Times called the song [...] "exuberant". Dennis Hunt from Los Angeles Times commented that [...] " [...] is an attractive package for dance fans—particularly with the inclusion of a new cut, 'Spotlight'". He went on to add that the [...] "lyrics of 'Spotlight' aren't great, but they're still more interesting than the others. Still, the words, like those of most dance songs, are just window dressing that's secondary to the beat. The big attraction of 'Spotlight' is a long, hard-driving, closing passage that's guaranteed to turn dancers on." [...] Jan DeKnock, while writing for Orlando Sentinel, noted that the song was already receiving airplay from radio stations.|$|E
500|$|... "Call My Name" [...] is a dance-pop song {{written in}} E major {{with a time}} {{signature}} in common time and a tempo of 125 beats per minute. The vocal range from the singer spans from C4 to C5. [...] "Call My Name" [...] borrows similarities to Rihanna's [...] "We Found Love" [...] (2011) and Scissor Sisters' [...] "Only the Horses" [...] (2012), tracks that were also produced by Harris. Brogan Driscoll of The Huffington Post speculated that the [...] "dance anthem" [...] title, [...] "Call My Name", could be linked Cheryl's recent decision to drop her married name from her professional career. Sarah Deen of Metro stated that the track features a [...] "typical Calvin Harris beat and singalong chorus", the chorus of the song was considered a departure from Cheryl's previous works, namely [...] "Fight for This Love" [...] (2009) and [...] "Promise This" [...] (2010), while Marie Claire columnist Eleanor Young described [...] "Call My Name" [...] as a [...] "fast paced party track". When Peter Robinson of Popjustice compared the song to [...] "We Found Love" [...] during {{an interview with the}} singer, she responded, [...] "that's going to be natural because it's Calvin. They're both Calvin-produced songs. So naturally you're going to think that. But if you play them side by side they don't sound the same. <b>Although</b> <b>you</b> might naturally think that, because it's the same producer. It's not a bad thing." [...] She also said that the lyrics of the song don't have a meaning, but they do have a feeling: [...] "I think it's quite a sexy lyric? Um… It's really not that deep. We're not saving the world with lyrics or anything." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} glowing {{praise from}} critics. Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "The Host" [...] a rare A+, noting {{that it was}} [...] "a refreshing instance of a fully and satisfactorily resolved episode — like a perfect meal, <b>although</b> <b>you</b> definitely don't want to eat during this one." [...] Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club described the episode as [...] "the first really, really icky X-Files", and while considering redundant the [...] "circular" [...] nature of the plot, with the creature {{coming back to the}} sewers after escaping, he felt that [...] "The Host" [...] "holds up because of the Flukeman's irreconcilable ugliness, and because it continues down the path that [...] "Little Green Men" [...] started on". On a more negative view, Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode 6/10, considering that [...] "as fun as this episode can be, there are some places were it just doesn’t quite add up", criticizing writing elements such as the lack of resolution, the explanation for the Flukeman's origins, and the [...] "heavy-handed" [...] introduction of X. A writer from the Vancouver Sun listed [...] "The Host" [...] {{as one of the best}} stand alone episodes of the show, saying that it broke the [...] "B-movie fun at best" [...] quality of most X-Files standalone episodes, saying that [...] "thanks to its cinema-grade made-up effects, claustrophobic sets and chilling subject matter, this Chris Carter-penned episode not only took the show to new heights of horror and suspense, it offered a fresh alternative on network television". [...] "The Host" [...] was later picked for the 2008 DVD The X-Files: Revelations, with eight episodes Chris Carter considered [...] "essential grounding" [...] for the film [...] The plot for the episode was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1997 by Les Martin.|$|E

[...] It features strong progressive rock elements, including its length, detailed structure, and multiple tempo changes throughout the song. Dickinson comments, [...] "the beauty of 'Paschendale' isn't in the epic-ness of the song – <b>although</b> <b>you</b> have to admit it is a powerful and stirring body of music – but the detail." [...] In live performances, Dickinson introduces the song with a passage from Wilfred Owen's [...] "Anthem for Doomed Youth".|$|E

But {{at the end of my}} 24 years, it was really so partisan that it was hard to make the combinations to get to 60 votes to break a filibuster to get things done." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ruben, {{a learned}} and pious Sephardi Jew living in exile at the [...] "Socola Academy", has {{instructed}} his favorite pupil about [...] "metempsychosis" [...] and apport: [...] "you can {{slip into the}} lives of all the ones who led up to your life [...] into all the future lives caused by your present life"; [...] "you can go any place you want, <b>although</b> <b>you</b> cannot leave it void behind you.

Taking the Dionis experience as evidence that Ruben is right, Dan asks to be transported into an ideal universe, and is told by his master that such a place exists [...] "in your immortal soul". If Dan wishes to reach it, he is to read every seventh page of a spell book: each will take him to a new place, in no known order, and no location can be visited twice. After Dan leaves, book in hand, Ruben is revealed to have been possessed by Satan, who takes joy at having ensnared a pious monk: the book is in fact an instrument of perdition.|$|E
