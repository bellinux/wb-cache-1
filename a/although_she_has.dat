5|$|After rescue, Bågenholm was {{transported by}} {{helicopter}} to the Tromsø University Hospital, where {{a team of}} more than a hundred doctors and nurses worked in shifts for nine hours to save her life. Bågenholm woke up ten days after the accident, paralyzed from the neck down and subsequently spent two months recovering in an intensive care unit. <b>Although</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> made an almost full recovery from the incident, late in 2009 she was still suffering from minor symptoms in hands and feet related to nerve injury.

5|$|<b>Although</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> {{campaigned on}} her husband's behalf since {{early in his}} {{political}} career by handshaking and fund-raising, she did not relish the activity at first. When she campaigned during her husband's 2000 run for United States House of Representatives, her boss at the University of Chicago {{asked if there was}} any single thing about campaigning that she enjoyed; after some thought, she replied that visiting so many living rooms had given her some new decorating ideas. Obama opposed her husband's run for the congressional seat, and, after his defeat, she preferred he tend to the financial needs of the family in what she deemed a more practical way.|$|E

Carry remains with her family {{for the rest of her}} life, but <b>although</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> returned to decency, her past ensures that she will never find an honest husband.|$|E
5|$|Dhumavati is {{described}} as a giver of siddhis (supernatural powers), a rescuer from all troubles, and a granter of all desires and rewards, including ultimate knowledge and moksha (salvation). Her worship is also prescribed for those who wish to defeat their foes. Dhumavati's worship is considered ideal for unpaired members of society, such as bachelors, widows, and world renouncers as well as Tantrikas. In her Varanasi temple, however, she transcends her inauspiciousness and acquires the status of a local protective deity. There, even married couples worship her. <b>Although</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> very few dedicated temples, her worship by Tantric ritual continues in private in secluded places like cremation grounds and forests.|$|E

5|$|Edea is one {{of three}} {{character}} concepts, along with Fujin and Raijin, to have been created before Final Fantasy VIII. Tetsuya Nomura had designed Edea even before the development of Final Fantasy VII, based on the style of Yoshitaka Amano, who was the character illustrator of Final Fantasy VI and previous games. In Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, Edea's design is used as an alternate costume of Ultimecia's. <b>Although</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> not appeared in Final Fantasy spin off games like Dissidia, her namesake has been carried into the Bravely Default series with Edea Lee.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to her Olympic and World Equestrian Games successes, van Grunsven holds {{the record for the}} most wins at the Dressage World Cup, winning the event nine times between 1995 and 2008. She has also competed numerous times at the European Dressage Championships, winning seven individual medals and eight team medals between 1991 and 2009. Although van Grunsven has ridden many horses over her career, she won the majority of her top events on two horses: Bonfire and Salinero. Bonfire, upon whom she had many of her early successes, was retired in 2002. Salinero quickly took over as van Grunsven's top horse, and remained in that position until his retirement in 2013, after making a major comeback to compete in the 2012 Olympic Games. Van Grunsven has been closely linked with the controversial training method rollkur, <b>although</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> moved to distance herself from the practice after it was banned from international competition.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most of Disney's princesses, Jasmine {{holds the}} {{distinction}} of being a supporting character in her own film, having been relegated to the secondary role of love interest. The character has garnered mixed reviews, with much denunciation directed towards her storyline and personality, both of which critics have dismissed as uninteresting and unoriginal; they have also accused Jasmine of lacking the depth of her predecessors Ariel and Belle from The Little Mermaid (1989) and Beauty and the Beast (1991), respectively, to whom she continues to be heavily compared. However, as the sixth Disney Princess and the franchise's first non-white member, the character is credited with introducing racial diversity to Disney's princess genre, <b>although</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> at the same time been criticized for being Westernized and Anglicized in both appearance and demeanor. Jasmine has made subsequent appearances in Aladdins sequels The Return of Jafar (1994) and Aladdin and the King of Thieves (1996), as well as its television series and a Broadway musical adaption of the film. Both Larkin and Salonga have been awarded Disney Legends for their contributions to the role.
