In this paper, we have {{proposed}} an inverse model for linear fractional programming (LFP) problems, {{in which the}} cost coefficients, technical coefficients and right hand side vector are adjusted {{as little as possible}} so that the given feasible or infeasible solution becomes optimal. In our proposed method, a nonnegative solution x 0 is taken and have adjusted the model parameters as little as pos-sible (under l 1 or l 2 measure) by taking following cases (i) <b>adjusting</b> <b>cost</b> coefficients (ii) <b>adjusting</b> <b>cost,</b> constraint coefficients and right hand side vector (iii) <b>adjusting</b> <b>cost</b> and constraint coefficients (iv) <b>adjusting</b> <b>cost</b> and right hand side vector.

5000|$|The cost of vertebroplasty in Europe as of 2010 was ~2,500 Euro. As of 2010 in the United States, {{when done}} as an outpatient, vertebroplasty costs around 3300 USD while kyphoplasty costs around 8100 USD and when done as an {{inpatient}} vertebroplasty cost ~11,000 USD and kyphoplasty 16,000 USD. The cost difference {{is due to}} kyphoplasty being an in-patient procedure while vertebroplasty is outpatient, and due to the balloons used in the kyphoplasty procedure. Medicare in 2011 spent about 1 billion USD on the procedures. [...] A 2013 study found that [...] "the average <b>adjusted</b> <b>costs</b> for vertebroplasty patients within {{the first quarter and}} the first 2 years postsurgery were $14,585 confidence interval (CI), $14,109-15,078 and $44,496 (95% CI, $42,763-46,299), respectively. The corresponding average <b>adjusted</b> <b>costs</b> for kyphoplasty patients were $15,117 (95% CI, $14,752-15,491) and $41,339 (95% CI, $40,154-42,560). There {{were no significant differences in}} <b>adjusted</b> <b>costs</b> in the first 9 months postsurgery, but kyphoplasty patients were associated with significantly lower <b>adjusted</b> treatment <b>costs</b> by 6.8-7.9% in the remaining periods through 2 years postsurgery." ...|$|R

5000|$|.....The {{cash value}} {{built-in}} the permanent insurance policy has limited tax advantage {{depending on the}} policy's ACB <b>adjusted</b> <b>cost</b> base. But investments {{in the form of}} segregated funds registered as TFSA (Tax Free Savings Account) or RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) offers better tax advantage, since both are registered government programs. If the cash value of a permanent insurance has grown big because of good fund management, the policy is likely to fail in the tax exempt test because of exceeding the MTAR (Maximum Tax Actuarial Reserve). Then, the policy becomes taxable. MTAR test has been effective in stopping the use of insurance as tax avoidance scheme.|$|E

Home-ownership is often seen as an arrival to the middle class, but recent trends are {{making it more difficult}} to continue to own a home or purchase a home. Housing prices fell dramatically following their 2006 bubble peak and remain well below this level. Many middle-class homeowners were particularly hard-hit by the crisis, as their homes were highly leveraged (e.g., purchased with a low down payment). The use of leverage magnifies gains (or losses in this case). They owe the full balance of the mortgage yet the value of the home has declined, reducing their net worth significantly.|$|E

Despite never hitting {{the number one}} spot and being an independent film with a $5 million budget, it ultimately grossed over $368.7 million worldwide, {{becoming one of the}} top romantic films of the 21st century according to Echo Bridge Entertainment. It was the fifth highest-grossing film of 2002 in the United States and Canada, with USD$241,438,208, and the highest-grossing romantic comedy in history. Domestically, it also held the record for the highest-grossing film never having been number one on the weekly North American box office charts, until the release of the 2016 animated film, Sing.

50|$|Several public {{meetings}} {{were held in}} towns along the parkways in late November and early December 2007 where Kentucky officials provided detailed information on upgrading the Parkways including changes to the projected cost for the upgrades. The <b>adjusted</b> <b>cost</b> of upgrading the parkways in SIUs 5 and 6 was pegged at around $300 million, significantly lower than initial estimates of $700 million. Of that $300 million price tag, high-priority projects accounted for about half ($145 million) of the total cost. Kentucky transportation officials also raised the idea of applying for a waiver {{that would allow the}} parkways to immediately be signed as I-69, making the parkways eligible for federal Interstate Highway funds to complete the upgrades. Without the I-69 designation, the parkway sections slated to become I-69 would not be eligible for Interstate Highway funds for upgrades. Kentucky officials announced that no funding for I-69 was included in the 2008-2014 Transportation Improvement Plan, and many legislators believed that tolls would be required to finance upgrades to the parkways.|$|E
50|$|The Center for American Progress {{reported}} in September 2014 {{that the real}} (inflation <b>adjusted)</b> <b>cost</b> of healthcare for middle-class families had risen by 21% between 2000 and 2012, versus an 8% decline in real median household income. Insurance and health care {{is an important factor}} regarding the middle-class squeeze because increases in these prices can put an added strain on middle income families. This situation is exactly what the House of Representatives survey shows regarding health care prices. In 2000, workers paid an average of $153 per month for health insurance coverage for their families, however, by 2005 these numbers had increased to $226 per month. The effects of the price change in health care can be seen in many ways regarding the middle class. The {{number of people who are}} uninsured has also increased since 2000, with 45.7 million Americans now without health insurance, compared to 38.7 million at the start of the millennium. Also, 18% of middle income Americans, making between 40,000 and 59,999 dollars were without health insurance during 2007 and more than 40% of the 2.4 million newly uninsured Americans were middle class in 2003. The rise in prices also causes a harm to working middle-class Americans because it makes it more costly for employers to cover their employees, as shown by the fact that in 2007 60% of companies offered their workers health insurance down from 69% in 2000. Also the number of Americans who reported skipping treatment due to its cost has increased from 17% to 24% during the same time period.|$|E
40|$|In The Per-mile Costs of Operating Automobiles and Trucks, Gary Barnes and Peter Langworthy {{provide a}} {{spreadsheet}} model for calculating {{the costs of}} operating cars and trucks, specifically for use in planning highway projects which change {{the conditions under which}} people drive. The specific costs addressed area fuel consumption, routine maintenance, tires, repairs, and some depreciation. Their approach to estimating costs is innovative in several ways. They have developed a way to determine the marginal costs of actually driving exclusive of the fixed costs of ownership. They also offer methods for <b>adjusting</b> the <b>costs</b> for different conditions and guidance on how to <b>adjust</b> <b>costs</b> in the future. The authors conclude that in a case of highway driving on smooth pavement at $ 1. 50 per gallon for gasoline, personal vehicles average 17. 1 cents per mile to operate and trucks average 43. 4 cents per mile. City driving conditions increase these costs by 3. 9 and 9. 5 cents per gallon, respectively. Minnesota Department of Transportatio...|$|R
