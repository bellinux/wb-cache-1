He makes several {{attempts}} to do so, including a biplane, bat wings, <b>a</b> <b>lawn</b> <b>chair</b> with balloons, {{and a giant}} kite pulled by a bicycle. All of these attempts fail, and SpongeBob faces ridicule from others. He tells those mocking him that [...] "it is a sad day in Bikini Bottom, when a guy is ridiculed for having dreams!" [...] They respond that they all have had unfulfilled dreams, and start chasing him. SpongeBob runs off a cliff and falls into a truck of mud, then into a truck of feathers.|$|E

The team's findings also revealed that several homes were obliterated before they experienced {{the full impact of}} the vortex's peak wind velocities, with some disintegrating as the external winds surrounding the parent tornado reached speeds of F2 intensity. Three months later, as homes were being built in the damage path, Marshall found their construction to be scarcely superior to that of the homes destroyed in the May 3 storm.|$|E
500|$|In reaction, he {{used his}} {{knowledge}} of particle physics to create a real-time computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) model for Flight Unlimited. The result is a simulated atmosphere: air acts as a fluid that automatically reacts {{to the shape of}} any object placed within it. Blackley gave the example that <b>a</b> <b>lawn</b> <b>chair,</b> if placed within the game's real-time CFDs model, would fall merely because of its shape. The game's planes fly because the interaction of their architecture with the atmosphere creates lift, as with real-world aircraft. Changes in the plane's direction are caused by the interaction of their flight control surfaces (ailerons, elevators and rudders) with the simulated atmosphere. Because it simulates the dynamics of flight in real-time, the system allows for aerobatic maneuvers that were impossible in previous flight simulators. In 1994, Blackley said that it was possibly the first flight code designed for aerobatics. In constructing the CFDs model, Blackley and the team built from the Navier–Stokes equations of fluid motion, which Blackley described as [...] "horrible, complicated partial differential equations". According to Computer Gaming World, Blackley did not seek to represent the equations with perfect accuracy, and he was satisfied when the results were consistent and the sensation that they generated was correct.|$|E

500|$|Polyakov's second spaceflight, {{the longest}} human spaceflight in history, began on January 8, 1994 with {{the launch of}} the Soyuz TM-18 mission.

6000|$|That small song {{has served}} {{to remind me}} of two small books I brought into the garden to read--the works of two modern minor poets whose [...] "wren-like warblings," [...] I imagined, would suit my mood and the genial morning better than the {{stirring}} or subtle thoughts of greater singers. Possibly in that I was mistaken; for there until now lie the books neglected on <b>a</b> <b>lawn</b> <b>chair</b> within reach of my hand. The chair was dragged hither half-an-hour ago by a maiden all in white, who appeared half inclined to share the mulberry shade with me. She did not continue long in that mind. In a lively manner, she began speaking of some trivial thing; but after a very few moments all interest in the subject evaporated, and she sat humming some idle air, tapping the turf with her fantastic shoe. Presently she picked up one of my books, opened it at random and read a line or two, her vermilion under-lip curling slightly; then threw it down again, and glanced at me out of the corners of her eyes; then hummed again, and finally became silent, and sat bending forward a little, her dark lustrous eyes gazing with strange intentness through the slight screen of foliage into the vacant space beyond. What to see? The poet has omitted to tell us to what the maiden's fancy lightly turns in spring. Doubtless it turns to thoughts of something real. Life is real; so is passion--the quickening of the blood, the wild pulsation. But the pleasures and pains of the printed book are not real, and are to reality like Japanese flowers made of coloured bits of tissue paper to the living fragrant flowers that bloom to-day and perish to-morrow; they are a simulacrum, a mockery, and present to us a pale phantasmagoric world, peopled with bloodless men and women that chatter meaningless things and laugh without joy. The feeling of unreality affects us all at times, but in very different degrees. And perhaps I was too long a doer, herding too much with narrow foreheads, drinking too deeply of the sweet and bitter cup, to experience that pure unfailing delight in literature which some have. Its charm, I fancy, is greatest to those in whom the natural man, deprived in early life of his proper aliment, grows sickly and pale, and perishes at last of inanition. There is ample room then for the latter higher growth--the unnatural cultivated man. Lovers of literature are accustomed to say that they find certain works [...] "helpful" [...] to them; and doubtless, being all intellect, they are right. But we, the less highly developed, are compounded of two natures, and while this spiritual pabulum sustains one, the other and larger nature is starved; for the larger nature is earthly, and draws its sustenance from the earth. I must look at a leaf, or smell the sod, or touch a rough pebble, or hear some natural sound, if only the chirp of a cricket, or feel the sun or wind or rain on my face. The book itself may spoil the pleasure it was designed to give me, and instead of satisfying my hunger, increase it until the craving and sensation of emptiness becomes intolerable. Not any day spent in a library would I live again, but rather some lurid day of labour and anxiety, of strife, or peril, or passion.|$|E

In honor of Linfield professor and artist Nils Lou, who passed away in December 2013, this year 2 ̆ 7 s sculptures respond to the prompt of 2 ̆ 2 a dream house for Nils. 2 ̆ 2 Artist 2 ̆ 7 s Statement When we were assigned 2 ̆ 2 Dream House For Nils, 2 ̆ 2 we thought to create something oceanic because it symbolizes freedom and adventure, two characteristics Nils embodied. This was our goal, to create a vessel that embodied Nils and his spirit. We thought of the Vikings and their culture, where when someone passes on, they send them off in a boat complete with amenities for the next life. This is what we thought of with our boat, a transportation vessel to his new, next adventurous world. We added details to his boat we thought he would enjoy and would be able to utilize in his next life. These details include <b>a</b> few <b>lawn</b> <b>chairs,</b> <b>a</b> captain 2 ̆ 7 s wheel to steer, rum to drink, a cigar to smoke, and a lower deck for shelter. As you can see, the back end of our boat has been left unfinished. We did this symbolically to show how Nils lived a full, but unfinished life. This is why the back of our boat is incomplete, to show what he left unfinished in this world. We hope Nils 2 ̆ 7 s journey to the next world brings him happiness and adventure. Those of us still in this life are all sad he will be making this journey without us, but know he will continue to live through us. Whether it be through art, humor, or his favorite, play, we know he will be looking over us, always. Rest in peace Nils, you will be missed but you will never be forgotten. [URL]...|$|R
