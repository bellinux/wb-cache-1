Islam and Ilez Yandiyev and Bashir Khamkhoyev {{were sentenced to}} life terms in a penal colony, while Akhmed Yevloyev was jailed for 10 years as he was a minor {{at the time of}} the attack. The government's investigators said that the bombing was carried out by Magomed Yevloyev, Akhmed's brother, on the orders of the leader of the Caucasus Emirate, Doku Umarov. The convicted were accused of sheltering the bomber in Nazran, Ingushetia, providing him with money and putting him on a bus to Moscow in preparation for the attack. The investigators also said that his attack was plotted at a camp run by the Caucasus Emirate in Ingushetia.|$|E

BLM {{was part of a}} march for peace on the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge in South Carolina. After the Charleston shooting, a number of memorials to the Confederate States of America were graffitied with [...] "Black Lives Matter" [...] or otherwise vandalized.

2500|$|Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaitė {{called the}} {{incident}} a [...] "brutal <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>terror</b> and stressed that {{people behind the}} tragedy must be clearly identified and brought to justice. It is a brutal <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>terror</b> which has shown explicitly that efforts {{of the international community}} to solve the crisis in Ukraine have been too weak. It is unjustifiable that in the 21st century Europe innocent people - dozens of children among them - die of weapons. Perpetrators must be named clearly and assume responsibility. Conditions must be established for the international observers to determine the executors and organisers of the tragedy". The Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevičius also conveyed condolences over the crash, [...] "We are deeply shaken by the event, which killed 298 innocent people including children. The accident would have clearly been prevented, if the conflict in Eastern Ukraine had not been escalated". While Raimonda Murmokaitė as the Lithuanian Permanent Representative to the United Nations urged to respect the memory of the victims of the catastrophe of MH17 and condemned any attempts to influence or interfere with the independent investigation conducted by the Dutch Safety Board.|$|E
2500|$|After the siege, 61 former hostages started seeking {{compensation}} for {{physical and emotional}} suffering totaling almost $60m from Moscow city authorities (according to Russia's [...] then-new anti-terrorism law, the region where an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>terror</b> occurs should pay {{compensation for}} moral and material damages). Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov's office denounced the suits, saying {{it could not be}} held responsible as [...] "the Chechen issue and its consequences are not within the jurisdiction of the Moscow authorities in any way." [...] The Moscow administration earlier agreed to pay 50,000 roubles ($1,570) in compensation to each former hostage and 100,000 roubles ($3,140) to relatives of those killed. In {{all but one of the}} cases, Moscow city courts rejected the compensation claims.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{highlight}} the conundrum of establishing the factual connection between the regime that secretly sponsors or supports terror and the actual <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>terror.</b> To hold a regime responsible for terrorism, accountability must be established. In this context, the ongoing civil action of Sokolow v. The Palestine Liberation Organization, 11 filed in the United States Federal Court for the Southern District of New York in 2008, perfectly illustrates the dilemma – on the one hand the offending regime disavows <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>terror</b> while on the other hand it secretly supports and orchestrates terror...|$|R
2500|$|In July 2006, the Menachem Begin Heritage Center {{organized}} a conference {{to mark the}} 60th anniversary of the bombing. The conference was attended by past and future Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former members of Irgun. A plaque commemorating the bombing was unveiled, stating [...] "For reasons known only to the British, the hotel was not evacuated." [...] The British Ambassador in Tel Aviv and the Consul-General in Jerusalem protested, saying [...] "We {{do not think that}} it is right for an act of terrorism, which led to the loss of many lives, to be commemorated", and wrote to the Mayor of Jerusalem that such an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>terror</b> could not be honoured, even if it was preceded by a warning. The British government also demanded the removal of the plaque, pointing out that the statement accusing the British of failing to evacuate the hotel was untrue and [...] "did not absolve those who planted the bomb." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Irgun's {{activities}} were classed as terrorism by MI5. The Irgun {{has been viewed}} as a terrorist organization or organization which carried out terrorist acts. In particular the Irgun was branded a terrorist organisation by Britain, the 1946 Zionist Congress and the Jewish Agency. Begin argued that terrorists and freedom fighters are differentiated in that terrorists deliberately try to target civilians, and that the Irgun was not guilty of terrorism since it supposedly tried to avoid civilian casualties. At the events to mark the 60th anniversary of the attack, Benjamin Netanyahu, then chairman of Likud and Leader of the Opposition in the Knesset, opined that the bombing was a legitimate act with a military target, distinguishing it from an <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>terror</b> intended to harm civilians. He said, [...] "Imagine that Hamas or Hizbullah would call the military headquarters in Tel Aviv and say, 'We have placed a bomb and we are asking you to evacuate the area.' They don't do that. That is the difference." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Spanish Civil War the Condor Legion bombed Guernica. Soon afterwards, {{and even}} in modern-day studies, historians {{referred}} to it as a deliberate <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>terror</b> bombing designed to break civilian morale. There is much debate as to why it was bombed. One simple, and possible reason for Richthofen sanctioning the bombing, was that two main roads being used to supply 23 Basque battalions at Bilbao intersected at Guernica. At least the 18th Loyola and Saseta battalions were stationed in the city at the time, making it a legitimate target. If the town was fortified, it would have made a major obstacle to the Nationalist advance, which would be unable to pass beyond the town. If Guernica was levelled, the roads and train lines, as well as the bridges, would deny the enemy an escape route and also deny them the ability to evacuate heavy equipment. Another mitigating factor was the alleged [...] "poor accuracy" [...] of German bomb sights (which were {{the best in the world}} at that time) in early 1937.|$|E

2500|$|... – Foreign Affairs Minister Maxime Bernier {{issued the}} statement: [...] "Canada condemns {{in the strongest}} terms this attack on the {{restoration}} of Pakistan’s efforts to return to full democracy. Today’s violence is especially heinous {{in view of the}} upcoming elections on January 8, 2008. The anti-democratic intent of the perpetrators could not be more obvious. I urge the Government and people of Pakistan to continue to reject all forms of violence and to resist those who seek to destabilize their country. Stability in Pakistan is vital for regional stability and security. We extend our deepest condolences to the family of Benazir Bhutto, {{to the families of the}} other victims of today’s attack, and to the Pakistani people. Our thoughts are with them at this difficult time." [...] Prime Minister Stephen Harper later added to reporters at a press meeting in Calgary: [...] "We condemn this attack in the strongest possible terms.

60|$|When Scotland {{began to}} recover from the dreadful shock she had {{sustained}} after the battle of Pinkie-Cleuch, Avenel {{was one of the first}} who, assembling a small force, set an example in those bloody and unsparing skirmishes, which showed that a nation, though conquered and overrun by invaders, may yet wage against them such a war of detail as shall in the end become fatal to the foreigners. In one of these, however, Walter Avenel fell, and the news which came to the house of his fathers was followed by the distracting intelligence, that a party of Englishmen were coming to plunder the mansion and lands of his widow, in order, by this <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>terror,</b> to prevent others from following the example of the deceased.|$|E

40|$|Terrorism {{is an old}} {{phenomenon}} that has been strengthened today. Several <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>terror</b> that have occured all over the world, especially in Indonesia, have created a sense <b>of</b> fear. Now, <b>acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>terror</b> which can be justified by religion have gained momentum. Such acts are almost always identified as being in some way related to Islam. The big question here is why the religion of Islam {{has been used in}} this way, that is as justification for terrorism. This paper elaborates on this issue, investigating some specific cases. First, it examines the difficulties <b>of</b> dining <b>terror</b> ism, and then discusses the nexus between religion and terrorism.
