During the summer of 2015, 10 Chu-SAM Kai missiles were test fired at White Sands Missile Range in the United States and successfully intercepted various targets, including the GQM-163 Coyote supersonic target drone; White Sands hosted the launches because the location's large size and controlled airspace allowed for testing conditions unavailable in Japan. Operational tests of the Chu-SAM Kai are expected to take place, again at White Sands, in 2016.|$|E

50|$|The surface combatants of the Royal Navy {{have their}} {{helicopters}} {{provided for the}} most part by the Lynx HMA8 aircraft. The Lynxes primarily have anti-submarine warfare and anti-surface vessel roles. They are able to fire the Sea Skua <b>anti-surface</b> <b>missile,</b> which was used to combat the Iraqi Navy in the 1991 Gulf War. It can be armed with Stingray air launched torpedoes and depth charges for anti-submarine warfare, as well as heavy calibre machine guns. The Lynx was originally envisaged for surface combatants that were too small for the Sea King, but now equips most frigates and destroyers of the Royal Navy. The Fleet Air Arm is introducing a total of 28 AW159 Wildcat HMA.2 helicopters to replace the Lynx HMA.8 in use in the Ship's Flights of the Royal Navy's escorts - this will perform a range of roles including anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare and airborne surveillance.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{naval vessels}} today are {{equipped}} with long range <b>anti-surface</b> <b>missiles</b> such as Harpoon and Exocet which are capable of crippling or destroying enemy ships with a single hit. These can be fired from vertical launch systems or from stand alone launch tubes and are designed to attack other warships. Smaller ships such as the US Navy's Littoral Combat Ship make use of smaller missiles such as [...] hellfire missiles in the surface to surface role that are less suited to attack warships but are still dangerous against fast attack craft or smugglers and pirates as well as land targets.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, surface naval combat {{was fought}} with large-caliber guns within visual range, but with modern <b>anti-surface</b> warfare, <b>missiles,</b> {{aircraft}} and submarine-launched torpedoes {{are now the}} predominant anti-ship weapons, with guns serving a secondary function.|$|R
50|$|In June 2014, {{propaganda}} {{pictures from}} the North Korean state TV briefly showed one of the newly built patrol SES vessels, firing a Kh-35 anti-ship cruise missile. Despite some initial doubts over {{the nature of the}} missile, they appear to be built in North Korea and have been exported to Myanmar (earlier speculations believed they were imported from Myanmar). The missile gives the KPN the potential to considerably improve its <b>anti-surface</b> <b>missiles.</b> In addition to the missiles, the SES vessels show a reversed-engined gun of 76 mm.Kh-35 missiles were also installed during 2014 on one of the two old Najin-class frigates (replacing the previous obsolete KN-01 missiles): the ship also received upgrades in gunnery.|$|R
50|$|The ships combat {{systems are}} {{produced}} by Armaris (a DCN/Thales joint venture) and are armed with the Aster 15 missile. The Aster missiles use the DCN SYLVER launcher. As with the La Fayette class the primary offensive weapon is the <b>anti-surface</b> Exocet <b>missile.</b> There are also four 533 mm aft torpedo tubes. The ship is armed with the DCNS F17 heavyweight anti-submarine torpedo.|$|R
50|$|Version 5 {{is due in}} 2012, and is {{intended}} to supplement the ships with mine clearance systems, helicopter landing capability (only K31 is certified to date), <b>anti-surface</b> ship <b>missiles</b> and additional stealth adaptation. Visby {{was the first of}} the corvettes to be upgraded to Version 5. On 22 March 2012 FMV reported that the ship had been modified and that the system would be tested before reentering the Swedish Navy by the end of 2012.|$|R
50|$|While ships do {{retain a}} robust anti-ship missile {{armament}} {{the ubiquity of}} such missiles makes an engagement with anti-ship missiles between surface ships fairly unlikely because for one ship to launch its missiles {{it would have to}} bring itself within range of the enemies missiles. Even with surprise the flight time of such missiles is long enough for an enemy to return fire before being hit making such an engagement extremely dangerous without some additional advantage. The Battle of Latakia during the Yom Kippur War saw Israeli missile boats sink an equal number of Syrian boats by using electronic counter measures and chaff to successfully avoid missile fire but modern missiles typically have additional guidance systems that make such defences much less effective. In a modern conflict <b>anti-surface</b> <b>missiles</b> would more likely be used against merchant shipping or auxiliary ships and only against similarly armed vessels when no other weapons are available. The arrival of networked weapon systems do potentially offer surface to surface missiles way to launch, using radar data from an aircraft or UAV to target missiles over the horizon and engage ships without exposing the launcher to retaliation although such systems are yet to be deployed.|$|R
50|$|The SH-2G's primary {{missions}} include anti-submarine and <b>anti-surface</b> warfare, anti-ship <b>missile</b> defense, and anti-ship {{surveillance and}} targeting.

50|$|Naval {{tactics and}} weapons {{systems can be}} {{categorized}} {{by the type of}} opponents they are intended to fight. Anti-air warfare (AAW) involves action against aircraft and incoming <b>missiles.</b> <b>Anti-surface</b> warfare (ASuW) focuses on attacking and defending against surface warships. Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) deals with the detection and destruction of enemy submarines.|$|R

5000|$|The F-4G was {{designed}} as an <b>anti-Surface</b> to Air <b>Missile</b> aircraft to jam and attack enemy radars when they were activated. [...] "Wild Weasel" [...] tactics and techniques were first developed in 1965 during the Vietnam War, and were later integrated into the Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) a plan used by US air forces to establish immediate air control, prior to possible full-scale conflict.|$|R
40|$|Ship {{defense in}} convoy {{operations}} against <b>Anti-Surface</b> <b>Missiles</b> (ASM) {{has been an}} important aspect of Naval Warfare for the last two decades. Countries in a state of conflict often conduct threatening operations in their own territories in order to slow or stop the enemy merchant ship traffic through the straits or littoral waters. Such littoral scenarios, the quantity and capability of ASM's in non-NATO countries pose a significant threat to the safe operation of the NATO forces in the waters off of potentially hostile shores. In these operations the goals of the tactical commander are to design an optimal reaction platform (formation) and to determine an optimal strategy that will help him in multi-threat encounters. The scope and design in most anti-air warfare studies have been limited to evaluating the effectiveness of detecting sensors and weapon systems in a regular screen formation. The proposed model's (Disposition Mission Model - DMM) characterization, however, is based on how to perform an effective, defensive disposition from a task force. In DMM we focus on usage of a graphical user interface and provide a user-friendly environment for analyzing new tactics in screen formations. The model, with its user interface, allows the user to build and run a convoy simulation, and see the results comparatively on the same interface. The analysis using this model has yielded significant insights towards the defense of a convoy by way of regression methods. It has been seen that positioning the escort ships within the threat sector reduces the damage on the HVU and also balances the defensive load of each defense ship for the incoming missiles. The model, with its graphical interface and simulation components, provides an initial approach for future analysts, not only in anti-air warfare defense of screen formations, but also in the areas of anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare[URL] Navy author...|$|R
50|$|Seventeen {{newspaper}} reporters, two photographers, two radio {{reporters and}} three television reporters with five technicians sailed with the Task Force to the war. The Newspaper Publishers' Association selected them from among 160 applicants, excluding foreign media.The hasty selection {{resulted in the}} inclusion of two journalists among the war reporters who were interested only in Queen Elizabeth II's son Prince Andrew, who was serving in the conflict. The Prince flew a helicopter on multiple missions, including <b>anti-surface</b> warfare, Exocet <b>missile</b> decoy and casualty evacuation.|$|R
5000|$|USS Princeton (CG-59) is a [...] {{guided missile}} cruiser {{serving in the}} United States Navy. Armed with naval guns and anti-air, <b>anti-surface,</b> and anti-submarine <b>missiles,</b> plus other weapons, she is {{equipped}} for surface-to-air, surface-to-surface, and anti-submarine warfare. She was previously home to two SH-60B LAMPS Mk III Seahawk helicopters and now carries a pair of the MH-60R version of the Seahawk.

5000|$|USS Normandy (CG-60) is a Ticonderoga-class {{guided-missile cruiser}} {{in the service}} of the United States Navy. Armed with naval guns and anti-air, <b>anti-surface,</b> and anti-submarine <b>missiles,</b> plus other weapons, she is {{equipped}} for surface-to-air, surface-to-surface, and anti-submarine warfare. The cruiser was the first US warship since 1945 to go to war on her maiden cruise and in 1998 she was awarded the title [...] "Most Tomahawks shot by a U.S. Navy Cruiser". She is named for the World War II Battle of Normandy, France, on and following D-Day.|$|R
2500|$|It was {{realized}} that the Soviet Union had acquired Type XXI and other advanced U-boats and would soon be putting their own equivalents into production. In 1948 the US Navy prepared {{estimates of the number}} of anti-submarine warfare (ASW)-capable submarines that would be needed to counter the hundreds of advanced Soviet submarines that were expected to be in service by 1960. Two scenarios were considered: a reasonable scenario assuming the Soviets would build to their existing force level of about 360 submarines, and a [...] "nightmare" [...] scenario projecting that the Soviets could build submarines as fast as the Germans had built U-boats, with a force level of 2,000 submarines. The projected US SSK force levels for these scenarios were 250 for the former and 970 for the latter. Additional <b>anti-surface,</b> guided <b>missile,</b> and radar picket submarines would also be needed. By comparison, the total US submarine force at the end of World War II, excluding obsolescent training submarines, was just over 200 boats.|$|R
25|$|Prince Andrew's {{place on}} board and the {{possibility}} of the Queen's son being killed in action made the British Government apprehensive, and the Cabinet desired that Prince Andrew be moved to a desk job {{for the duration of the}} conflict. The Queen, though, insisted that her son be allowed to remain with his ship. Prince Andrew remained on board Invincible to serve as a Sea King helicopter co-pilot, flying on missions that included anti-submarine warfare and <b>anti-surface</b> warfare, Exocet <b>missile</b> decoy, casualty evacuation, transport, and search and air rescue. He witnessed the Argentinian attack on the SS Atlantic Conveyor.|$|R
40|$|The free {{electron}} laser (FEL) is among the latest technologies {{of interest to the}} U. S. military, in particular, the Navy. In naval applications, FEL laser would serve as a self-defense weapon system, protecting the ship from an array of threats including <b>anti-surface</b> cruise <b>missiles</b> and small boats. This system's potential range and deep magazine makes it ideal as point defense against incoming missiles. Its inexpensive cost of only a few dollars per engagement and multi-mission capability makes this future weapon system superior to the short-range missile-defense systems employed today. The most powerful FEL is currently located in Jefferson Lab, operating at 10 kW, two orders of magnitude short of the 1 MW power level required for weapons application. This thesis will describe the components and theory of operation of the FEL, as well as analyze two competing designs for {{the next step in the}} evolution of the future weapon system, the 100 kW FEL, proposed by Brookhaven and Los Alamos National Labs. Due to advances in NPS simulation techniques for the amplifier configuration, a more in depth analysis including the effects of electron beam tilt and shift is performed for the first time on these proposed designs...|$|R
2500|$|In mid-April, the {{destroyer}} underwent a tender availability alongside [...] {{during which the}} DASH system was removed. Although unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) would return to warships in the future, the DASH system's immature technology proved too unreliable for continued operation. Carpenter spent {{the next few months}} conducting refresher training in preparation for a major fleet exercise that summer. Underway for San Diego, California and STRIKEX 1-68 on 14 June, Carpenter carried out shore bombardment, <b>anti-surface</b> and anti-cruise <b>missile</b> operations in the waters off southern California until 2 July. She then steamed to Santa Monica, California, for a port visit before returning to Pearl Harbor. Following a series of pre-deployment tests and inspections, and a tender availability alongside Bryce Canyon, Carpenter received upgrades to her radar fire control systems in preparation for her next Vietnam tour. After testing the new equipment in early September, Carpenter got underway for another Far East deployment on 17 September.|$|R
