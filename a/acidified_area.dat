40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that wild birds {{breeding}} in <b>acidified</b> <b>areas</b> have difficulties with obtaining sufficient calcium for their eggshells, and that the cause of it is the shortage of land snails. Many birds have to search for Ca-rich snail shells on a daily basis during egg production. Molluscs depend on litter calcium, which has decreased due to acidification of the environment. Calcium limitation may be a widespread phenomenon also in non-acidified, naturally Ca-poor areas. The problem is that while in the latter areas the time for development of specific adaptations may have been sufficient, then in <b>acidified</b> <b>areas,</b> on the contrary, calcium shortage is a recent phenomenon. Therefore, since the extent of calcium limitation in non-acidified areas is hard to derive from observational data, experimental approach is needed. We provide experimental evidence that specific calcium deficit does affect reproductive traits also in the birds breeding in naturally base-poor habitats. Our study was conducted in a heterogeneous woodland area in Estonia containing deciduous forest patches as well as base-poor pine forest with low snail abundance. Ca supplementation, using snail shell and chicken eggshell fragments, was carried out for pied flycatchers and great tits. Extra calcium affected positively several reproductive traits like egg volume and eggshell thickness, start of breeding, and fledglings&# 146; parameters. The negative relationship between calcium availability and lay-date suggests that birds adjust their breeding tactics to conditions of Ca deficiency, for example, by postponing laying...|$|R

The increasing acidification from the coastal to inland/highland region of Southern and Southeastern Norway (pH 7. 2 - 4. 1) {{was accompanied by a}} decreasing frequency of amphibian (Rana temporaria, Bufo bufo and Triturus vulgaris) localities. In the (anthropogenically) non-acidified Central Norway region (pH 6. 8 - 4. 6), R. temporaria was very common at all pH levels. The data strongly suggest that acidification explains the absence of amphibians locally in the <b>acidified</b> <b>areas,</b> and has caused their extinction in the inland/highland region of Southern Norway. A pH of 4. 5 - 4. 6 is the critical minimum for R. temporaria populations in small, poorly buffered, boggy, water-bodies as were investigated here. For B. bufo, the lowest pH recorded was 4. 7, and for T. vulgaris 4. 8. We did not find any signs of successful reproduction in Rana arvalis and Triturus cristatus below a pH of 5. 2 and 5. 3, respectively. Increased contents of Ca 2 +, Na+ (NaCl) or humus (NOM) had an ameliorating effect on the amphibians in acidic water. The presence of Al was of only minor importance for the amphibians in humic waters. In a strategy for the conservation of amphibians in <b>acidified</b> or <b>acidifying</b> <b>areas,</b> liming (CaCO 3) and/or NaCl treatment of the localities may work well in order to establish a satisfying aquatic environment for the species. The study may act as a baseline for further surveys in the future when acidic precipitation hopefully has decreased, looking for improvements of the habitats and possible recoveries of amphibian sites. </p...|$|R

The Model of Acidification of Groundwater In Catchment (MAGIC) has been calibrated to the second of two surveys, taken in 1994 - 1995, using a Monte-Carlo methodology. The first survey, 1983 - 1984, provides a basis for model validation. The model simulates a significant decline of water quality across the region since industrialisation. Agreed reductions in sulphur (S) emissions in Europe in accordance with the Second S Protocol will result in a 49 % reduction of S deposition across Wales from 1996 to 2010. In response to these reductions, the proportion of streams in the region with mean annual acid neutralising capacity (ANC) > 0 is predicted to increase from 81 % in 1995 to 90 % by 2030. The greatest recovery between 1984 and 1995 and into the future is at those streams with low ANC. In order to ensure that streams in the most heavily <b>acidified</b> <b>areas</b> of Wales recover to ANC zero by 2030, a reduction of S deposition of 80 - 85 % will be required...|$|R

Liming is a mitigation technique {{that can be used}} to restore forest health in <b>acidified</b> <b>areas,</b> but little is known about how it affects the growth or nutrient content of deer forage. We examined the effects of dolomitic limestone application on the growth and chemical composition of understory plants in an acidified forest in central Pennsylvania, with a focus on vegetative groups included as white-tailed deer forage. We used a Before-After-Control-Impact study design with observations 1 year before liming and up to 5 years post-liming on 2 treated and 2 untreated 100 -ha sites. Before liming, forage availability and several nutrients were below levels considered optimal for white-tailed deer, and many vegetative characteristics were related to soil chemistry. We observed a positive effect of liming on forb biomass, with a 2. 7 fold increase on limed sites, but no biomass response in other vegetation groups. We observed positive effects of liming on calcium and magnesium content and negative effects on aluminum and manganese content of several plant groups.

The remediation strategy consisted of partial restoration of marine tidal exchange within estuarine creeks and incremental tidal inundation of acidified soils, plus strategic liming of drainage waters. Time-series {{water quality and}} climatic data collected over 5 years were analysed to assess changes in water quality due to this remediation strategy. A time-weighted rainfall function (TWR) was generated from daily rainfall data to integrate the effects of antecedent rainfall on shallow groundwater levels {{in a way that}} was relevant to acid export dynamics. Significant increases in mean pH were evident over time at multiple monitoring sites. Regression analysis at multiple sites revealed a temporal progression of change in significant relationships between mean daily electrical conductivity (EC) vs. mean daily pH, and TWR vs. mean daily pH. These data demonstrate a substantial decrease over time in the magnitude of creek acidification per given quantity of antecedent rainfall. Data also show considerable increase in soil pH (2 – 3 units) in formerly <b>acidified</b> <b>areas</b> subject to tidal inundation. This coincides with a decrease in soil pe, indicating stronger reducing conditions. These observations suggest a fundamental shift has occurred in sediment geochemistry in favour of proton-consuming reductive processes.

Sulphate concentrations in lakes have decreased by 40 % in <b>acidified</b> <b>areas</b> in southern Norway. This decrease has been compensated about 25 % by decreases in concentrations of base cations and of 75 % by increased Acid Neutralising Capacity (ANC). The increased ANC in turn reflects lower concentrations of acidic cations Aluminum (AL n+) and Hydrogen (H +). A sub-set of 78 of the 485 lakes sampled yearly between 1986 and 1997 shows that, at first most of the decrease in non-marine sulphate (SO 4 *) was compensated by a decrease in base cations, such that ANC remained unchanged. Then as SO 4 * continued to decrease, the concentrations of non- marine calcium and magnesium ((Ca+Mg) *) levelled out. Consequently, ANC increased, and H + and Al n+ started to decrease.

40|$|I am {{investigating}} {{areas of}} the seabed that are already acidified by carbon dioxide, {{so that we can}} see which organisms thrive and which are most vulnerable. To do this I am investigating underwater volcanoes where carbon dioxide bubbles up like a Jacuzzi, <b>acidifying</b> large <b>areas</b> of the seabed for 100 s of years. The natural gradients of carbon dioxide are like a time machine, showing which organisms can survive and what coastal habitats might look like in the coming years. But a major criticism has been that all my work was focused on one volcanic vent site off Ischia Island near Vesuvius; so how is this relevant to the people who grow shellfish in the NE Atlantic or those that show tourists the Great Barrier Reef? For the past year my group has been repeating the Ischia experiments at other volcanic vents in Europe, Baja California and Papua New Guinea. What concerns me most is that as the carbon dioxide levels increase to those we expect to see in our life-times this causes a dramatic loss of marine biodiversity, both in temperate and in tropical systems. Key groups, like sea urchins and coralline algae, cannot survive as the water becomes corrosive, and fish avoid the high carbon dioxide areas when they lay their eggs. Some organisms are able to adapt to the effects of long-term acidification – some can calcify even faster at high carbon dioxide levels - but the vents mainly benefit non-calcified organisms. Invasive species of algae and stinging jellyfish do especially well. Some species have an outer layer of protective tissue that allows them to tolerate acidified seawater, such as Porites corals in the tropics and Mytilus mussels in temperate areas. But these carbon dioxide tolerant organisms can only survive if they are not stressed by other factors. We have found that the combination of acidification and rising temperatures kills-off corals and shellfish and that increasing carbon dioxide reduces biodiversity across-the-board, from simple organisms (such as bacteria and microalgae), to flora (like seaweeds and seagrasses), and fauna (such as corals and molluscs). I hope that information from these naturally <b>acidified</b> <b>areas</b> will be used to strengthen marine conservation efforts, as unstressed systems are more resilient than stressed ones.

40|$|Many {{catchments}} in high N-deposition {{areas have}} low N retention. It has been hypothesised that {{under such conditions}} P addition may increase N retention in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Fertiliser trials in N-saturated terrestrial ecosystems show that P addition can cause increased plant uptake of N. Few studies, however have focused on N leaching to surface waters. Theoretical considerations and limited empirical data suggest that P addition to acidic, oligotrophic lakes will stimulate NO 3 assimilation and thereby increase alkalinity and N retention within the lake. Near-shore coastal waters may benefit from reduced riverine N loading during summer in terms of reduced algal biomass and reduced probability of development of toxic dinoflagellate blooms. P treatment may be suitable to neutralise moderately acidified lakes and streams (pH> 5. 2). P addition will also increase biodiversity, stimulate aquatic production and improve the resource base for fish production. In more acidic lakes and streams, a combination of liming and moderate P addition may be an optimal management tool. We conclude that a large-scale experiment is necessary to test if P addition (both terrestrial and aquatic) might provide a mitigation technique for areas experiencing high NO 3 levels in surface waters. Possible technological solutions {{on how to use}} P to increase pH and stimulate biological production in <b>acidified</b> <b>areas</b> have been evaluated.

40|$|Stable {{carbon and}} {{nitrogen}} isotope analysis (SIA) {{was used to}} examine trophic interactions in a naturally acidified shallow coastal CO 2 area in the Mediterranean Sea. SIA was helpful to determine the potential effects of ocean acidification (OA) on the interactions of organic matter sources and polychaete consumers, which appear to be tolerant to high pCO 2. Mesoherbivore consumers, represented by three polychaete species, Platynereis dumerilii (Audouin and Milne Edwards, 1834) (Nereididae), Polyophthalmus pictus (Dujardin, 1839) (Opheliidae) and Syllis prolifera Krohn, 1852 (Syllidae), are abundant in the low pH conditions of the CO 2 vents. Samples of consumers and potential organic matter sources (macroalgae, seagrass and epiphytes) were collected in two periods (May-June and Oct-Nov 2012) in two <b>acidified</b> <b>areas</b> (Castello Aragonese CO 2 vents, off Ischia, Italy) and in two control areas. Results suggest a substantial effect of high pCO 2 on isotopic composition of both organic matter sources and consumers. The recurring 13 C depletion observed in the acidified sites is probably due to an increase in carbon availability and to the exploitation of volcanic-derived dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) present in the area. The nutritional quality of organic matter sourceswas higher in lowpH stations, where indeed C:N ratios decreased. Despite the occurrence of these effects, the trophic habit of high pCO 2 tolerant polychaete consumers seems not to be dramatically affected. Our findings shed the light on how some benthic organisms may respond well to near-future OA conditions, exhibiting high plasticity also in their feeding habits, without being subject to dramatic ecological changes...|$|R
40|$|Liming is {{a common}} {{technique}} used to restore forest health in <b>acidified</b> <b>areas</b> but little is known on the remanence of this amendment in forest ecosystems. We thus investigated how calcareous amendments impact internal biogeochemical cycling of beech stands (Fagus sylvatica), especially the chemistry and traits of leaves and leaf litter and the subsequent rate of litter decomposition 25 years after applications. We also {{wanted to know if}} leaf features provide easy predictive tools of litter quality. In both limed and unlimed stands, we compared functional traits (SLA, LDMC, stomatal density), nutrients and fiber contents (hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin) of green and senescent leaves. Additionally, litter bags were used to infer litter decomposition rate. Our results clearly showed that liming impacts leaf chemistry but not morphological leaf traits many years after treatment. In limed stands, green leaves had significantly higher content of Ca and lignin, but lower Mg and cellulose. For senescent leaves, limed stands had greater Ca, Na and cellulose, but lower K, Mn, and N. Resorption rates of K, Na and Mg, in senescent leaves were also affected by limed treatment. We also found a higher litter decomposition rate in limed stands than in unlimed stands. We thus demonstrated that the effect of liming on soil nutrient availability was weak but that changes in beech leaf quality could be recorded 25 years after treatment. These mid-term liming effects on leaf litter quality likely alter soil properties, soil biota and their interactions and thus litter decomposition rate. Lastly, the use of functional leaf traits as a proxy of ecosystem functioning (such as litter decay) is not sufficiently sensitive to detect changes in sites with smooth environmental stress variation...|$|R
40|$|Freshwater {{sensitivity}} to acidification {{varies according to}} geology, soils and land-use, and consequently it remains difficult to quantify the current extent of acidification, or its biological impacts, based on limited spot samples. The problem is particularly acute for river systems, where the transition from acid to circum-neutral conditions can occur within short distances. This paper links an established point-based long-term acidification model (MAGIC) with a landscape-based mixing model (PEARLS) to simulate spatial and temporal variations in acidification for a 256 km 2 catchment in North Wales. Empirical relationships are used to predict changes in the probability of occurrence of an indicator invertebrate species, Baetis rhodani, across the catchment {{as a function of}} changing chemical status. Results suggest that, at present, 27 % of the river network has a mean acid neutralising capacity (ANC) below a biologically-relevant threshold of 20 μeq l− 1. At high flows, this proportion increases to 45 %. The model suggests that only around 16 % of the stream network had a mean ANC < 20 μeq l− 1 in 1850, but that this increased to 42 % at the sulphur deposition peak around 1970. By 2050 recovery is predicted, but with some persistence of acid conditions in the most sensitive, peaty headwaters. Stream chemical suitability for Baetis rhodani is also expected to increase in formerly <b>acidified</b> <b>areas,</b> but for overall abundance to remain below that simulated in 1850. The approach of linking plot-scale process-based models to catchment mixing models provides a potential means of predicting the past and future spatial extent of acidification within large, heterogeneous river networks and regions. Further development of ecological response models to include other chemical predictor variables and the effects of acid episodes would allow more realistic simulation of the temporal and spatial dynamics of ecosystem recovery from acidification...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{terrestrial}} sources of biogenic S and {{their effect on}} atmospheric chemistry remain as major unanswered questions {{in our understanding of}} the natural S cycle. The role of northern wetlands as sources and sinks of gaseous S was investigated by measuring rates of S gas exchange as a function of season, hydrologic conditions, and gradients in trophic status. Experiments were conducted in wetlands in New Hampshire (NH), and in Mire 239, a poor fen at the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) in Ontario. Emissions were determined using Teflon enclosures, gas cryotrapping methods, and GC with flame photometric detection. Emissions of DMS dominated fluxes. In NH, DMS fluxes were greater than 1. 6 micromol/m(sup - 2) d(sup - 1) in early summer, 1989 when temperatures were warm and the water table was approximately 5 cm below the surface. These rates are several-fold faster than average oceanic rates of DMS emission. A rapid drop in the water table resulted in a 6 -fold decrease in DMS emissions in late July. In 1990, a new beaver dam kept water levels above the surface and S emissions were much lower than during 1989. The elimination of the beaver and a drop in the water table in August produced a rapid increase in S gas emissions. Emissions of DMS were highest in the most oligotrophic areas. Mire 239 (ELA) was irrigated with sulfuric and nitric acids to simulate acid rain. S emissions were determined before and after an acidification event in control and experimental areas in both minerotrophic and oligotrophic regions. Emissions of DMS were higher in the <b>acidified</b> <b>areas</b> compared to unacidified controls. Emissions were also much higher in the oligotrophic regions compared to the minerotrophic ones. Despite the wide differences in S gas fluxes (20 -fold), it was difficult to determine whether acidification or variations in trophic status was not responsible for differences in S gas emissions.

Some samples are also analysed for calcium, manganese, sodium, potassium, sulphur, chlorine, silicon, aluminium concentrations and nitrate.

During {{the last six years}} also total phosphorous (Tot-P), total nitrogen (Tot-N) and total organic carbon (TOC) have been analysed in one yearly autumn sample (September-November). In several rivers, especially in the southernmost part of Norway, the water is characterized by low pH, alkalinity and calcium concentrations. These localities are situated within areas which are affected by acid precipitation, and the water quality may have negative effects upon fish and other freshwater organisms living in these rivers. The water quality of the rivers Rondvatn, Store Ula, Åna, Otra and Haugsdalselva in 2011 indicates an ecological status of “moderate” or worse based on the criteria suggested for the implementation of the Water Framework Directive in Norway. However, the acidification situation in these rivers has shown a clear improvement in the 1990 ies with an increase in pH and ANC and a decrease in inorganic (toxic) aluminium. Most localities in middle and northern parts of Norway have a high content of calcium and high alkalinity and pH levels. For most rivers nutrient levels are generally low, or even very low. Rivers Imsa and Vefsna dis-play the highest levels of phosphorous, but the concentrations indicate no signs of deviation from reference conditions.

During their differentiation, they overexpress two lysosomal enzymes, cathepsin K and TRAP, which are secreted into the resorption lacuna, an <b>acidified</b> sealed <b>area</b> {{in contact with}} bone matrix where bone degradation takes place. Here we report that the acid hydrolase HYAL 1, a hyaluronidase able to degrade the glycosaminoglycans hyaluronic acid (HA) and chondroitin sulfate, is also upregulated upon osteoclastogenesis. The mRNA expression and protein level of HYAL 1 are markedly increased in osteoclasts differentiated from RAW 264. 7 mouse macrophages or primary mouse bone marrow monocytes compared to these precursor cells. As a result, the HYAL 1 -mediated HA hydrolysis ability of osteoclasts is strongly enhanced. Using subcellular fractionation, we demonstrate that HYAL 1 proteins are sorted to the osteoclast lysosomes even though, in contrast to cathepsin K and TRAP, HYAL 1 is poorly mannose 6 -phosphorylated. We reported previously that macrophages secrete HYAL 1 proforms by constitutive secretion, and that these are recaptured by the cell surface mannose receptor, processed in endosomes and sorted to lysosomes. Present work highlights that osteoclasts secrete HYAL 1 in two ways, through lysosomal exocytosis and constitutive secretion, and that these cells promote the extracellular residency of HYAL 1 through downregulation of the mannose receptor. Interestingly, {{the expression of the}} other main hyaluronidase, HYAL 2, and of lysosomal exoglycosidases involved in HA degradation, does not increase similarly to HYAL 1 upon osteoclastogenesis.

Since Industrial Revolution, in less of 250 years, pH of surface seawater decreased on average of 0. 1 unit, {{and is expected}} to further decreases of approximately 0. 3 - 0. 4 units {{by the end of this}} century. Naturally <b>acidified</b> marine <b>areas,</b> such as CO 2 vent systems at the Ischia Island, allow to study acclimatation and adaptation of individual species as well as the structure of communities, and ecosystems to OA. The main aim of this thesis was to study how hard bottom sublittoral benthic assemblages changed trough time along a pH gradient. For this purpose, the temporal dynamics of mature assemblages established on artificial substrates (volcanic tiles) over a 3 year- period were analysed. Our results revealed how composition and dynamics of the community were altered and highly simplified at different level of seawater acidification. In fact, extreme low values of pH (approximately 6. 9), affected strongly the assemblages, reducing diversity both in terms of taxa and functional groups, respect to lower acidification levels (mean pH 7. 8) and ambient conditions (8. 1 unit). Temporal variation was observed in terms of species composition but not in functional groups. Variability was related to species belonging to the same functional group, suggesting the occurrence of functional redundancy. Therefore, the analysis of functional groups kept information on the structure, but lost information on species diversity and dynamics. Decreasing in ocean pH is only one of many future global changes that will occur at the end of this century (increase of ocean temperature, sea level rise, eutrophication etc.).

30|$|Plant P {{acquisition}} and uptake {{can be enhanced}} through rhizospheric activity, which is characterised by biological (microbial activity), chemical and spatial (root growth) features [10, 11]. Soil microorganisms can promote P uptake by plants through different mechanisms, such as organic P (Po) mineralisation, enhanced root growth either by mycorrhizal associations or by hormonal stimulation, and finally by solubilisation of inorganic phosphorus (Pi) [12]. The potential mechanisms for phosphate solubilisation by microorganisms appear to be acidification of the soil, the release of organic acid anions (i.e. citrate, oxalate, gluconate) and the secretion of phosphatases and phytases [12, 13]. Several authors report {{a wide range of}} soil bacteria and fungi that are able to solubilise different precipitated P forms under limiting P conditions [14 – 16]. Wakelin et al. [17] have found that Penicillium spp. are commonly present on wheat roots grown in Australia and demonstrate a P-solubilising capacity. Penicillium spp. has been found to solubilise rock phosphate in liquid culture [17, 18] and calcium phosphate in an agar medium [19]. Among Penicillium species, Penicillium bilaii (P. bilaii) has been shown to produce oxalic and citric acid as its major metabolites [20]. Kucey [21] suggests that P. bilaii may enhance P availability to plants by releasing organic acids, which may <b>acidify</b> specific <b>areas</b> of the rhizosphere or act as a chelator of cationic partners of the phosphate anion [22]. Furthermore, P. bilaii has been identified to increase biomass production and P uptake and grain yield in wheat, canola, bean, pea and lentil in experiments conducted in growth chambers and in the field [14, 23 – 25]. Most of the studies in which P. bilaii has been shown to promote plant growth and P solubilisation have been conducted in calcareous soils in Canada with moderate or low P levels [18, 19, 23]. Wakelin [26] also demonstrated the potential use of Penicillium spp. inoculants to increase plant growth in alkaline soils in Australia. Studies on the effect of P. bilaii on acidic soils have not been found in the literature.|$|R
40|$|Soil {{profiles}} in 10 persistently bare areas (i. e. scalds), mainly located in coastal backswamps of New South Wales, Australia, were examined for chromium-reducible sulfur content and selected chemical properties. At 5 of the sites, the adjacent paddocks with vegetation cover were also examined. All of the tested sites had {{been affected by}} the extensive drainage of the surrounding acid sulfate soil (ASS) landscapes and the consequent oxidation of pyrite. All sites had low pH values in the surface soil layers and these low pH values extended for up to 150 cm into the underlying unoxidised blue/grey pyritic estuarine gels. This {{can be attributed to the}} downward diffusion of acidity, either produced in the overlying oxidised zones of these soils or transported laterally across the landscape to these low-lying <b>areas.</b> <b>Acidified</b> unoxidised pyritic zones 120 cm thick can evidently form within several decades after drainage disturbance. At the scalded sites the depth from the soil surface to the main pyritic zone varied from the surface to 3 ̆e 200 cm depth, indicating that this variable is not critical to ASS scald formation. For most of the sites examined, the chromium-reducible sulfur contents in the surface soil layers were appreciably higher than those in the immediately underlying soil layers. In most of the vegetated sites the chromium-reducible sulfur content in the surface layers was considerably higher than for the adjacent scalded site. The conditions necessary for pyrite formation (i. e. adequate supplies of organic matter, soluble iron, sulfate, and waterlogging) were found to exist at all sites, and the pyrite accumulations in these surface soil layers are considered to be neo-formed. The vegetated soil-profile pyrite and pH results were very similar to their scalded counterparts except that they had an extra 20 – 40 cm layer of vegetation and mulch that was missing from the scalded profiles. This indicates that there is considerable potential for more extensive scalding in these ASS areas...|$|R
