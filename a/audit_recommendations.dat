40|$|Jackson and Stent (2010) {{describes}} an, Auditor as {{an independent}} expert whose primary responsibility is to express an independent opinion on whether the financial statements show a true and fair view. An auditor identifies and evaluates risks which may affect financial statements assertions. In addition to an expression of an opinion, Auditors also provide very useful recommendations in response to identified risks. When an audit recommendation is made to an organisation basically its management {{is responsible for the}} implementation. If management decides not to implement <b>audit</b> <b>recommendations,</b> risks will remain according to www. anao. gov. au. Study findings revealed that Civil Service Commission (CSC), which is a Government institution, was not managing risk more effectively as evidenced by the recurrence of same audit observations and the non-implementation of <b>audit</b> <b>recommendations</b> within the agreed time frames. Jackson and Stent (2010) said management is responsible for managing risks. CSC was experiencing serious challenges in the accountability of public funds. This study therefore sought to investigate into managementâ€™s reluctance in implementing <b>audit</b> <b>recommendations</b> at CSC. The Citizenry demands good accountability and the efficient use of public money from those to whom delegated authority of managing public funds and resources has been conveyed to. Public money should be properly accounted for in terms of The Constitution of Zimbabwe and The Public Finance Management Act and the Auditor-General is required by law to examine all public accounts for at least once every year. Directors and management should therefore make sure that adequate measures which safeguard public money and property from abuse and wasteful allocation are in place and they should take heed of the Auditor-General and Internal <b>audit</b> <b>recommendations</b> in order to correct defects in the management of public funds. The non- implementation of <b>audit</b> <b>recommendations</b> was exposing the Civil Service Commission to wide risk factors which included the misappropriation of public funds, fraudulent activities and wasteful spending of public funds. The objectives {{of the study was to}} establish what were the major causes of reluctance in the implementation of <b>audit</b> <b>recommendations</b> which safeguards public funds at CSC and to provide recommendations which will help CSC to overcome reluctance towards the implementation of <b>audit</b> <b>recommendations.</b> The major findings were obtained through questionnaires and interviews and major findings revealed that non-implementation of <b>audit</b> <b>recommendations</b> was being caused by the lack of management support and commitment towards the implementation of <b>audit</b> <b>recommendations</b> and also due to the absence of an audit committee which in turn compromise the independence of auditors. The study recommended that the Civil Service Commission should speed up efforts towards the establishment of an audit committee and there is also need for the update of the current legal frameworks so as to give more sanction powers to the Auditor â€“General to allow him/her to monitor the implementation of <b>audit</b> <b>recommendations</b> by Ministries as observed by Zinyama (2013). The identified legal instruments which required updates were the Constitution of Zimbabwe, The Public Finance Management Act and The Audit Office Act.

40|$|Curriculum {{management}} audits are {{an intensive}} investigation, or audit, {{of a school}} district 2 ̆ 7 s daily operations, including curriculum, policies, organizational structure, financial operations, and use of assessment data. Curriculum audits are conducted {{by a team of}} certified auditors composed of professional educators and administrators. Curriculum audit findings are used to generate recommendations, which are presented to the school district in an audit report. The <b>audit</b> <b>recommendations</b> provide the district with specific recommended actions that are intended to improve district operations and to improve student achievement. This research examined whether implementation of curriculum <b>audit</b> <b>recommendations,</b> as perceived by key administrators, influenced student achievement as measured by standardized test scores. To make this determination four specific areas were examined: 1) student achievement gains based on standardized test scores, 2) the perception of key administrators regarding the level of audit recommendation implementation, 3) the perception of key administrators regarding the impact of curriculum audit recommendation implementation on student achievement, and 4) a comparison of student achievement gains between audited and non-audited districts. This study was unable to establish that the implementation of curriculum management <b>audit</b> <b>recommendations,</b> as perceived by key administrators, influenced student achievement as measured by state standardized test scores. It is possible that implementation of <b>audit</b> <b>recommendations</b> influenced student achievement, {{but there was no way}} to clearly establish this influence in this study because one variable - implementation - did not vary much: all districts reported high levels of implementation.

40|$|All too {{frequently}} audit recommenda-tions are received by software project teams and immediately {{hung up on}} a dart-board for target practice. One reason they are not well received {{is because they are}} misunderstood. <b>Audit</b> <b>recommendations</b> are simply designed to be guidelines to achieve reasonable control, not specific instructions that hinder an organization’s ability to be productive and efficient. With the appropriate level of commu-nication between auditors and project teams, <b>audit</b> <b>recommendations</b> can actual-ly be extremely helpful for organizations {{to reduce the risk of}} excessive defects, delayed releases, cost overruns, and unmet customer requirements. Unfortunately, poor communication between auditors and project teams is one of the main reasons that organizations are not able to effectively reduce their systems-based risk exposure. Frequently this poor communication causes one of two scenar-ios. The first is that project teams overstate the effort necessary to become compliant with <b>audit</b> <b>recommendations,</b> thinking that what the auditors are asking is entirely unfeasible. In the second scenario, project teams underestimate what the auditors are recommending because they missed the intent of the recommendation.

40|$|Performance audit, {{compared}} to the traditional financial and compliance audits, {{is a relatively new}} innovation that emerged amidst accountability concerns in the public sector. Economic crises, ministerial scandal and inefficiencies were among the impetus that led the public to demand better performance and greater accountability in the public sector, and performance audit was among the many responses to such demand. In New Zealand, performance audit is carried out by the Controller and Auditor General (the AG) under the mandate granted by the Public Audit Act 2001. Adapting the methodology from grounded theory, this study looks at the impact of performance audit on seven entities audited in 2006 by the AG. This study found that the entities were impacted through the manifestation of implemented <b>audit</b> <b>recommendations</b> and the attainment of performance audit goals. In particular, there is a high acceptance and implementation rate to the <b>audit</b> <b>recommendations</b> made in the seven audits. The implementation of accepted recommendations consequently led to the changes within the entities in terms of managerial practices, as well as internal systems and processes. In some entities, these changes were translated into performance improvement, where the entities experienced changes {{in the way that they}} carried out their operations.

30|$|The {{results of}} the survey {{revealed}} that auditors were typically satisfied with how they plan, execute, and accomplish tasks. Auditors usually followed standard procedures for accomplishing tasks. However, the audit field assignment was executed {{on the basis of}} task units.
