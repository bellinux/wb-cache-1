The second level has 16sections of seating that begin behind third base and wrap around to first base. The last nine rows, from row M, on the first level between the dugouts are sheltered by the upper deck. Seats on both levels are traditional, plastic stadium-style chairs. All lower-level seats behind home plate, seats behind and between the dugouts through row P, and all second-level seats have padded seat cushions. Seats in the three center upper-deck sections behind home plate and all second-level suites also have padded seat backs. A grass berm that can accommodate 1,500spectators is located beyond the left-center field wall.|$|E
5|$|Redbacks usually prey on insects, but {{can capture}} larger animals that become {{entangled}} in the web, including trapdoor spiders, small lizards, and even on rare occasion snakes. One web was recorded as containing a dead mouse. The woodlouse (Porcellio scaber) is a particularly common food item. Developing spiderlings need size-appropriate prey, and laboratory studies {{show that they are}} willing to consume common fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), mealworm larvae (Tenebrio molitor), muscoid flies and early nymphs of cockroaches. Food scraps and lighting attract insect prey to areas of human activity, which brings the redbacks. Once alerted to a creature becoming ensnared in a trap line, the redback advances to around a leg's length from its target, touching it and squirting a liquid glutinous silk over it to immobilise it. It then bites its victim repeatedly on the head, body and leg joints <b>and</b> <b>wraps</b> it in sticky and dry silk. Unlike other spiders, it does not rotate its prey while wrapping in silk, but like other spiders, it then injects a venom that liquefies its victim's innards. Once it has trussed the prey, the redback takes it to its retreat and begins sucking out the liquefied insides, generally 5 to 20 minutes after first attacking it. Redback spiders do not usually drink, except when starved.|$|E

A pronounced crease started from the mid-body section <b>and</b> <b>wraps</b> {{over the roof}} while the rear quarter panels feature bulges around the wheel well openings. The rear panel has a recessed and blacked out area with four lights. The design of the concept car improved visibility around the Gremlin's original wide C-pillar.|$|E
25|$|Boots <b>and</b> <b>wraps</b> {{are worn}} by almost all horses, {{due to the}} fact that they may easily injure their legs when landing or when making tight turns at speed. Open-fronted tendon boots usually are worn on the forelegs, because they provide {{protection}} for the delicate tendons that run down the back of the leg, but still allow the horse to feel a rail should it get careless and hang its legs. Fetlock boots are sometimes seen on the rear legs, primarily to prevent the horse from hitting itself on tight turns.|$|E

Since the early 1990s, KFC has expanded its menu to offer other chicken products such as chicken fillet burgers <b>and</b> <b>wraps,</b> as well as salads and side dishes, such as French fries and coleslaw, desserts, and soft drinks, the latter often supplied by PepsiCo.

500|$|Traditional Navajo weaving used upright looms with no moving parts. Support poles were {{traditionally}} {{constructed of}} wood; steel pipe {{is more common}} today. The artisan sits on the floor during weaving <b>and</b> <b>wraps</b> the finished portion of fabric underneath the loom as it grows. [...] The average weaver takes anywhere from 2 months to many years to finish a single rug. [...] The size greatly determines {{the amount of time}} spent weaving a rug. The ratio of weft to warp threads had a fine count before the Bosque Redondo internment and declined in the following decades, then rose somewhat to a midrange ratio of five to one for the period 1920-1940. 19th-century warps were colored handspun wool or cotton string, then switched to white handspun wool in the early decades of the 20th century.|$|E

500|$|When frogs mate, {{the male}} climbs {{on the back}} of the female <b>and</b> <b>wraps</b> his fore limbs round her body, either behind the front legs or just in front of the hind legs. This {{position}} is called amplexus and may be held for several days. The male frog has certain hormone-dependent secondary sexual characteristics. These include [...] the development of special pads on his thumbs in the breeding season, to give him a firm hold. The grip of the male frog during amplexus stimulates the female to release eggs, usually wrapped in jelly, as spawn. In many species the male is smaller and slimmer than the female. Males have vocal cords and make a range of croaks, particularly in the breeding season, and in some species they also have vocal sacs to amplify the sound.|$|E
500|$|James Montgomery of MTV News {{said that}} the song seemed [...] "tailor-made" [...] for him, playing on the {{strengths}} {{that led him to}} win American Idol. Montgomery also said, [...] "his husky, broad voice, shuffly guitar playing and genuinely sweet disposition – <b>and</b> <b>wraps</b> them in a well-worn, subtly sexy tune, full of wide-eyed, dare we say inspirational sentiments. Yet, at the same time, it's also incredibly earnest in tone." [...] Misha Berson of the Seattle Times described the song as [...] "surprising, and maybe a little jarring at first, if you expected a ballad or a mellow groove with a spare arrangement, like some of Allen's best performances on American Idol that paved the way to his Season 8 win". [...] In spite of Berson's initial surprise at the song's sound, she went on to praise the single as [...] "very catchy, a bit inspirational", and [...] "energetic". She praised the chorus and further commended the song as [...] "a marked improvement over what some Idol winners have put out as their first post-show single".|$|E
500|$|As {{described}} around 50 AD, {{lettuce leaves}} were often cooked and {{served by the}} Romans with an oil-and-vinegar dressing; however, smaller leaves were sometimes eaten raw. During the 81–96 AD reign of Domitian, the tradition of serving a lettuce salad before a meal began. Post-Roman Europe continued the tradition of poaching lettuce, mainly with large romaine types, {{as well as the}} method of pouring a hot oil and vinegar mixture over the leaves. Today, the majority of lettuce is grown for its leaves, although one type is grown for its stem and one for its seeds, which are made into an oil. Most lettuce is used in salads, either alone or with other greens, vegetables, meats and cheeses. Romaine lettuce is often used for Caesar salads, with a dressing that includes anchovies and eggs. Lettuce leaves can also be found in soups, sandwiches <b>and</b> <b>wraps,</b> while the stems are eaten both raw and cooked. The consumption of lettuce in China developed differently from in Western countries, due to health risks and cultural aversion to eating raw leaves. In that country, [...] "salads" [...] were created from cooked vegetables and served hot or cold. Lettuce was also used in a larger variety of dishes than in Western countries, contributing to a range of dishes including bean curd and meat dishes, soups and stir-frys plain or with other vegetables. Stem lettuce, widely consumed in China, is eaten either raw or cooked, the latter primarily in soups and stir-frys. Lettuce is also used as a primary ingredient in the preparation of lettuce soup.|$|E

500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety said, [...] "what seemed, in theory, the least-necessary {{revival of}} a big screen superhero emerges as {{perfectly}} solid summer action fare in The Incredible Hulk." [...] He emphasized [...] "it's all par-for-the-course cinematic demolition and destruction, staged efficiently and {{with a hint of}} enthusiasm," [...] and [...] "penned with sporadic wit [...] Visuals lean toward the dark and murky, but editing by three—actually six—hands is fleet, and Craig Armstrong's ever-present score is simultaneously bombastic and helpfully supportive of the action. Effects are in line with pic's generally pro but not inspired achievements." [...] Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald applauded that the film [...] "does a lot of things [...] Lee's Hulk didn't: It's lighter and faster-paced, it's funnier and it embraces (instead of ignoring) the 1970s TV series that furthered the character's popularity". Mark Rahner of The Seattle Times wrote that, [...] "The relaunch of Marvel's green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee's ponderous 2003 Hulk in nearly every way – except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than something from a video game, and he still barely talks". Lou Lumenick of the New York Post said, [...] "What lingers in my memory ... is the lengthy, essentially animated climactic battle between the Hulk and the Abomination on the streets and rooftops of Harlem, and an earlier showdown between the title creature and the U.S. Army, which is deploying high-tech weapons including sound-wave cannons. These are expertly staged by director Louis Leterrier, who disposes of the backstory under the opening credits <b>and</b> <b>wraps</b> up the whole thing in twenty-four minutes less than [...] Lee took". Roger Ebert was not a fan of the film stating, [...] "The Incredible Hulk is no doubt an ideal version of the Hulk saga for those who found Ang Lee's Hulk too talky, or dare I say, too thoughtful. But not for me. It sidesteps the intriguing aspects of Hulkdom and spends way too much time in, dare I say, noisy and mindless action sequences." ...|$|E
