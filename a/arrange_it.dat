5|$|According to Sharaf, 1934–1937 was {{the happiest}} period of Reich's {{personal}} life, despite the professional problems. His relationship with Elsa Lindenberg {{was good and}} he considered marrying her. When she became pregnant in 1935, they were initially overjoyed, buying clothes and furniture for the child, but doubts developed for Reich, who saw the future as too unsettled. To Lindenberg's great distress, Sharaf writes, Reich insisted on an abortion, at that time illegal. They went to Berlin, where the psychoanalyst Edith Jacobson helped to <b>arrange</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Leopold spent vast sums {{of money}} on gifts and estates for his young mistress, {{presenting}} for instance the Villa Leopolda to Caroline in 1902. She frequently traveled to Paris to visit her dress- and hat-maker, once bragging that she spent three million francs on dresses at a single store on one occasion. Caroline once complained to Leopold that the evening express train back to Brussels gave her little time to shop, causing Leopold to <b>arrange</b> <b>it</b> so that the train would leave an hour later. When pregnant with their first child, the king and the French government even split the cost of constructing a new road close to her villa so that her ride would not be uncomfortable. Taking Caroline with him everywhere, the king {{spent much of his}} time outside Belgium on his various properties throughout Western Europe, and was much resented by the Belgian people as a result. Much of this time was spent with Caroline and their two sons at his estate at Cap Ferrat in southern France. Caroline also stayed at Chateau de Larmoy, which Leopold had rented for her; he acquired the French Chateau de Balaincourt as well as a villa in Brussels, where Caroline had no scruples in appearing in public. Though typically traveling incognito, she accompanied Leopold to the funeral of Queen Victoria in 1901, causing a great scandal. Her unpopularity in Belgium increased dramatically once it began to be realized that all of Leopold's riches from the Congo were not benefiting his country, but rather himself and his young mistress.|$|E

At one of these soirees, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky played the finale of his Little Russian Symphony. After hearing it, she begged the composer in tears to let her <b>arrange</b> <b>it</b> for piano duet. However, illness intervened and Tchaikovsky made the arrangement himself.|$|E
25|$|Ra'aya Meheimna is {{distributed}} over several parashiyot throughout the Zohar. Part {{of it is}} known and even printed on separate pages, {{and part of it}} is weaved into the body of the Zohar. Ra'aya Meiheimna is found in Vols. 2 and 3 of the Zohar, but is not found explicitly in Vol. 1. Several great rabbis and sages have tried to find the Ra'aya Meheimna, which originally is a vast book on all the 613 mitzvot, and <b>arrange</b> <b>it</b> according to the order of positive commandments and negative commandments, and even print it as a book on its own.|$|E
25|$|The Union army {{converged on}} Vicksburg, {{trapping}} Pemberton's force. Grant attempted two assaults {{to break through}} the strong Confederate fieldworks: May 19 and May 22. The latter assault initially achieved some success in McClernand's sector, but it was repulsed with 3,200 casualties. Johnston ordered Pemberton to evacuate the city and save his army, but Pemberton thought it impossible to withdraw safely. Johnston planned to attack Grant and relieve Pemberton but was unable to <b>arrange</b> <b>it</b> in time. Grant besieged the Confederate army. On July 4, after six weeks in which the soldiers and civilians of Vicksburg had no food supplies and were bombarded constantly, Pemberton surrendered the city and his army.|$|E

25|$|In 1816, an {{exploration}} party {{under the command}} of James Hingston Tuckey was sent to Africa to establish whether the stretches of river then named the Niger River and the Congo River were one river or two. The expedition failed dismally: within a few months of reaching the river, many of the party were dead, including Tuckey and the expedition botanist Christen Smith (also known as Christian Smith and Chetian Smith). The botanical assistant, David Lockhart, survived, and eventually returned a collection of around 600 plant species to Joseph Banks. Banks turned the collection over to Brown to <b>arrange</b> <b>it,</b> and see what might be published based on it.|$|E

500|$|Tchaikovsky {{played the}} finale of his Second Symphony, subtitled the Little Russian, at a {{gathering}} at Rimsky-Korsakov's house in Saint Petersburg on January 7, 1873, before the official {{premiere of the}} entire work. To his brother Modest, he wrote, [...] "he whole company almost tore me to pieces with rapture—and Madame Rimskaya-Korsakova begged me in tears to let her <b>arrange</b> <b>it</b> for piano duet". Rimskaya-Korsakova was a noted pianist, composer and arranger in her own right, transcribing works by {{other members of the}} kuchka {{as well as those of}} her husband and Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet. Borodin was present and may have approved of the work himself. Also present was Vladimir Stasov. Impressed by what he had heard, Stasov asked Tchaikovsky what he would consider writing next, and would soon influence the composer in writing the symphonic poem The Tempest.|$|E
500|$|After getting {{permission}} to use the song from Merrill, Griffith quickly turned to Narada Michael Walden, who was producing Aretha Franklin's [...] "I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)", for her album Who's Zoomin' Who?, at the time. After getting in touch with Walden, Griffith frantically implored him to produce the song, describing how important the song would be for Houston's future album. After hearing the song's demo, Walden agreed to fly down to San Rafael, California to <b>arrange</b> <b>it.</b> He was not much impressed with the demo and requested permission to change some of the song's lyrics and chord progression. Flustered by his request, Merrill and Rubicam denied him the right to their song. After a lot of back-and-forth with Griffith, they compromised and allowed Walden to de-construct the song and change the key and tempo. After completing the song, Houston came into the studio to record her vocals. Cissy Houston, the singer's mother, joined her daughter to perform the song's background vocals. [...] Griffith explained: ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1967—after the album was completed—Evans flew with McCartney to Los Angeles to see McCartney's then-girlfriend, Jane Asher, who was acting there with the Old Vic theatre company. The three of them went {{on a trip to}} the Rockies, {{returning}} to LA in Frank Sinatra's jet. Evans: [...] "We left Denver in Frank Sinatra's Lear Jet, which he very kindly loaned us. A beautiful job with dark black leather upholstery and, to our delight, a well-stocked bar." [...] When they were back in LA, they were invited to visit the house of Michelle and John Phillips, from the Mamas & the Papas. Brian Wilson was also there, as he was working on the Beach Boys Smile album. Evans wrote about singing [...] "On Top of Old Smokey" [...] with McCartney and Wilson, but was not impressed by Wilson's avant-garde attitude to music: [...] "Brian [...] then put a damper on the spontaneity of the whole affair by walking in with a tray of water-filled glasses, trying to <b>arrange</b> <b>it</b> into some sort of session." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Jewish Girl's Song (...) , Number 2b of the {{original}} score, existed {{in a number of}} versions. It was originally written for flute and orchestra.

In 1939, he <b>arranged</b> <b>it</b> for voice and orchestra for the American contralto Marian Anderson, under the title [...] "Solitude".|$|R

500|$|As Petrucci and Rudess {{felt that}} the album needed real string lines and choirs, {{as well as other}} organic sounds, they enlisted the help of veteran {{composer}} David Campbell to assist with aspects of the orchestration and handle the logistics of recording all of the necessary musicians. Reflecting on the process for Keyboard, Rudess explained, [...] "Our initial thought was, let’s do it all on rock instruments and let David <b>arrange</b> <b>it,</b> but that wasn’t really thinking ahead in terms of who we are. When we go into the studio, we tend to work on things until they’re pretty polished. So we got into what we called pre-orchestrating. I’d use any sound at my disposal to place strings where we wanted to hear strings, choir where we wanted choir, and so forth—but without getting overly specific about a certain patch or instrument library being the one, because we knew it was all going to be replaced with real players." [...] Once the album's arrangements were complete, they were performed and recorded in studios around the world, with Campbell conducting and leading the sessions from Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, viewers saw Martha {{coming to}} terms with a second pregnancy. The storyline began after Martha left old boyfriend Roman Harris (Conrad Coleby) for Jack. She was unsure of the child's paternity, but kept it a secret from Jack. Gordon said this is [...] "Because she doesn't think he ever needs to know. Roman's said he doesn't want to be {{involved}} and he wants to say it's Jack's. And so does Martha..." [...] After Martha has a miscarriage scare, Roman wanted to know if the baby was his. Gordon explained that [...] "Roman says he needs to know if he is or isn't the baby's father and Martha has to agree to do a DNA test. [...] They wait till Jack's out of the room then quickly <b>arrange</b> <b>it.</b> Martha's so scared of losing Jack she wants the facts before deciding her next step." [...] Martha's relationship with Jack was at its strongest at that time, but Gordon was concerned about Martha's lies: [...] "Martha and Jack have been through more than most and right now their relationship is as solid as it could be. But she's taking a big chance not being honest about her pregnancy." [...] She described Roman being the baby's father as [...] "Martha's worst nightmare".|$|E

2500|$|During {{the hours}} {{previous}} to the session's start, the PNV revealed {{that they would}} not support Sánchez, rather deciding on whether to abstain or vote against him after analyzing his speech. After mutual disagreements over the previous weekend on whether the PSOE had answered a PNV offer made the previous week, it was revealed that the PSOE's counter-offer was [...] "so unacceptable"—the precise content of which was not disclosed—that they both had initially agreed to <b>arrange</b> <b>it</b> as if no answer had been received. After Sánchez's speech, the PNV confirmed it would vote [...] "no", pointing to the PSOE–C's pact as an impediment for negotiations. CC, previously expected to support Sánchez, also announced the withdrawal of its support shortly thereafter, opting to abstain on the basis that [...] "there is no credible or viable majority to govern".|$|E
