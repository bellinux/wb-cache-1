40|$|To {{determine}} {{the incidence of}} homozygous deletions of the newly identified tumour suppressor gene, CDK 4 I, molecular genomic DNA analyses by PCR technique were performed on primary neoplastic cells from 22 childhood acute leukaemias obtained at presentation. The blast cells derived in all the analysed cases from bone marrow. We found that none of <b>acute</b> <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukaemias</b> (four cases) showed the CDK 4 I alteration, whereas 6 / 13 (46 %) common acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALLs) displayed homozygous deletions. Moreover, and even more important, all the blasts purified from ALLs derived from early lymphoid precursors (three early-T ALLs and two pre-B ALLs) showed the absence of CDK 4 I gene. When the entire coding sequence of the CDK 4 I gene from samples without homozygous deletions was analysed by the single-strand conformational polymorphism method, no point mutations were identified. These results demonstrate that CDK 4 I gene deletions are very frequent and probably early events in childhood acute leukaemias of lymphoid origin and especially in early-T and pre-B ALLs. Moreover, the molecular mechanism {{of the loss of}} function of the gene is correlated, at least in childhood ALLs, almost exclusively to deletions and not to point mutations...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{measure the}} effects of changes in {{treatment}} of <b>acute</b> <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukaemia</b> that may give better value for money. DESIGN [...] Retrospective analysis of patients' notes to identify items of management costing money; prospective costing of these items. The Medical Research Council <b>acute</b> <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukaemia</b> 9 trial was used to identify the amount and distribution of these costs when either one or two courses of induction treatment were required to obtain complete remission. These findings were then extrapolated to four published international controlled trials using similarly intense treatment and in which the number of courses of treatment required for complete remission was stated, to compare British costs for treatment with idarubicin and daunorubicin, both in combination with cytarabine. SETTING [...] Leukaemia unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, London. SUBJECTS [...] Data on 10 patients receiving intensive induction treatment for <b>acute</b> <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukaemia</b> were used to identify 160 items of cost in four broad groups: general (including accommodation), diagnostic, supportive treatment, and cytotoxic chemotherapy. One newly treated patient was prospectively assessed over one month, including a time and motion study, to cost these items; then costs for 268 patients from the MRC trial receiving moderate induction chemotherapy including daunorubicin were assessed, and costs for treatment of 522 patients in the four international studies comparing daunorubicin with idarubicin were analysed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Cost effectiveness was measured as the overall cost to obtain complete remission in untreated patients with <b>acute</b> <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukaemia</b> after treatment with idarubicin or daunorubicin. RESULTS [...] The 160 costed items were measured for their sensitivity in varying {{the total cost of}} treatment, this being assessed within Britain in other district general and private hospitals to measure the extremes of cost of these items. Overall, idarubicin, although more expensive, showed a substantial saving (1477 pounds per patient) in total hospital costs, more than offsetting the increased cost (607 pounds) of the new treatment, an overall savings of 870 pounds per patient (5 %). CONCLUSION [...] Approaches modelling cost effectiveness may be an essential part of planning new programmes of treatment in the future. This method can be used to estimate the cost effectiveness of the treatments in different environments and countries where costs may vary widely...|$|E

Sixty three (70 %) of those with Down's syndrome had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and in comparison with 3664 (84 %) controls had similar prognostic features except for a significant excess of the 'common' immunological subtype of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The outcome of the children with Down's syndrome was significantly worse with a five year overall actuarial survival of 28 % compared with 59 % in the control group. It appeared that both suboptimal chemotherapy and {{a high rate of}} infective problems contributed to the poor survival. Twenty six children with Down's syndrome had <b>acute</b> <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukaemia</b> and were significantly younger and had a higher percentage of the megakaryocytic and erythroid subtypes of <b>acute</b> <b>myeloblastic</b> <b>leukaemia</b> than the 713 controls.
