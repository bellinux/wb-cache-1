6000|$|His father, John Shakespeare, was a farmer's {{son from}} the {{neighboring}} village of Snitterfield, {{who came to}} Stratford about 1551, and began to prosper as a trader in corn, meat, leather, and other agricultural products. His mother, Mary Arden, {{was the daughter of}} a prosperous farmer, descended from an old Warwickshire family of mixed Anglo-Saxon and Norman blood. In 1559 this married couple sold a piece of land, and the document is signed, [...] "The marke + of John Shacksper. The marke + of Mary Shacksper"; and from this it has been generally inferred that, like the vast majority of their countrymen, neither of the poet's parents could read or write. This was probably true of his mother; but the evidence from Stratford documents now indicates that his father could write, and that he also audited the town accounts; though in <b>attesting</b> <b>documents</b> he sometimes made a mark, leaving his name to be filled in by the one who drew up the document.|$|E
