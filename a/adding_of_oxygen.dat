When the bellows fills during exhalation, the gas is released from the dosage chamber into the breathing circuit, proportional to the volume in the bellows during exhalation, and is fully released when the bellows is full.

40|$|Plasma bullets are {{ionization}} fronts created in atmospheric-pressure plasma jets. The propagation behavior of those bullets is, in the literature, {{explained by the}} formation of an interface between the inert gas and the ambient air created by the gas flow of the plasma jet, which guides these discharges in the formed gas channel. In this paper, we examine this ionization phenomenon in uniform gases at atmospheric pressure where this interface between two gases is not present. By changing electrical parameters and adding admixtures such as oxygen, nitrogen, and air to the gas flow, the conditions for which plasma bullets are present are investigated. Nanosecond time-resolved images have been taken with an ICCD camera to observe the propagation behavior of these discharges. It is argued that the inhomogeneous spatial concentration of metastable atoms and ions, due to the laminar gas flow and the operation frequency of the discharge in the range of a few kilohertz, is responsible for the guidance of the {{ionization fronts}}. Furthermore, conditions have been observed at where the branching of the discharge is stable and reproducible over time {{in the case of a}} helium plasma by <b>adding</b> admixtures <b>of</b> <b>oxygen.</b> Possible mechanisms for this phenomenon are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The thesis has {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} the composition of the compost mixture containing sewage sludge, grass and organic fraction of municipal waste, on the effectiveness of the composting process as well as the influence of the obtained composts on the effectiveness of soil phytoremediation. In the first stage, the composting process was carried out and in the second stage of the research, a pot experiment was conducted and the soil supplements were gradually applied, then their influence on the process of degraded soil renourishment was evaluated. During the research, the physical and chemical properties of the soils after the use of resources such as compost and bio-fertilizer gained from the processing of sewage sludge during the process of assisted phytoremediation of highly degraded soil (high content of heavy metals) were assessed. The composting process was carried out in two stages, the first of which lasted for four weeks and was carried out in a closed bioreactor with a flow <b>of</b> <b>added</b> <b>oxygen.</b> The second stage, on the other hand, included so-called ripening.

The second procedure is a direct determination of the zirconium oxide content by w~porization () f the met'd in chlorine gas. The residue must be corrected for side reactions with carbon.

40|$|The effects <b>of</b> <b>added</b> <b>oxygen</b> gas on {{analytical}} glow discharges (GD) -, {{significant changes}} in electrical characteristics, and emission line intensities of both analyte and carrier gas (usually Ar) - have been shown experimentally and predicted by computer models. However, past experimental studies were either limited {{to one or two}} spectral lines for each element, or used oxygen concentrations far higher than those likely in analytical work. These changes can seriously affect both the stability of the glow discharge and the analytical results. Contamination by oxygen traces can be curtailed by using high purity carrier gas, modern vacuum techniques and a “clean” instrument. However, the complexity of discharge processes is far greater when oxygen traces are present in the sample either as constituent such as Fe 2 O 3, Ti 2 O 3 and Al 2 O 3 or within an alloy. Investigations were carried out in three separate locations - at Imperial College London (IC), The Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science & Technology EMPA, Thun, Switzerland and The Leibniz-Institut für Festkörper- und Werkstoffforschung IFW, Dresden, Germany.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{thermally}} induced methanol reactions on bimetallic Ru(0001) -based catalyst surfaces performed under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Specifically, reaction intermediates and pathways on various clean and oxygen covered surfaces (Ru(0001), Cu/Ru(0001), Pt/Ru(0001), and Pt_xRu_ 1 -x/Ru(0001) surface alloys) have been studied by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and temperature programmed desorption. On {{the basis of this}} comparison and results reported in the literature methanol reactions on metal surfaces can be subdivided into two major pathways: (i) total dehydrogenation of methanol leading to CO, and (ii) an oxidation pathway which produces gaseous CO_ 2. On the clean surfaces either the dehydrogenation pathway is observed or no reaction occurs at all. The CO_ 2 producing path opens up only upon adsorption <b>of</b> <b>oxygen.</b> In parallel, the CO formation diminishes. In this context, the influence <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> on the yields of possible reaction products is analyzed. Generally, it is found that methanol reactions are promoted by disordered and dilute oxygen layers; dense and ordered O-overlayers, on the other hand, passivate the surface effectively. Referring to the direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC), a significant drawback <b>of</b> <b>adding</b> <b>oxygen</b> is the reaction <b>of</b> the <b>oxygen</b> atoms with hydrogen from methanol dehydrogenation to gaseous water. As hydrogen is the energy provider in a DMFC the desorbing water represents an unwanted drain of H atoms. Interestingly, the surfaces which produce the highest amount of CO_ 2 are also most efficient with respect to water formation. As the drain of H atoms on oxygen covered Pt_xRu_ 1 -x/Ru(0001) surface alloys is limited and they nonetheless exhibit CO_ 2 as a final product they represent a compromise regarding the ideal catalyst material for a DMFC. In particular, alloys with a Pt content of 50 - 80 % are found to display superior performance. ...|$|R

40|$|Background Better {{knowledge}} of wine composition, especially that of anthocyanin-derived pigments, has helped improve wine quality over the years. The use of micro-oxygenation (MOX), which consists in <b>adding</b> low quantities <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> {{at different stages}} of the winemaking process, contributes to enhancing and stabilizing wine color through the formation of stable pigments called pyranoanthocyanins, while the cycloaddition of anthocyanins requires an oxidation step. Scope and approach This review describes the formation kinetics and the evolution of the concentrations of the various groups of pyranoanthocyanins. Both non-oxygenated and oxygenated varietal red wine samples are compared {{in order to determine the}} impact of MOX on pyranoanthocyanin contents. Key findings and conclusions During alcoholic fermentation, the concentration of vitisin A increases due to the availability of pyruvic acid and progressively decreases with aging. Higher contents are found in Port red wines. MOX can enhance the concentrations in dry red wines but the contents remain lower than those found in Port wines. The formation of vitisin B can be promoted by the oxidation of ethanol in acetaldehyde but the results depend on the varietal red wine used. Flavanol-pyranoanthocyanin contents also vary according to wine age, with a reported decreasing concentration during aging for Port and dry red wines. After MOX treatment, their concentrations increase with a more acidic pH and a higher oxygen rate. The increase of the content in pyranoanthocyanins after two years of ageing contributes to stabilize wine colour. Further studies will determine the impact <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> on phenyl-pyranoanthocyanins since data are still scarce on the subject...|$|R

Excess H 2 O 2, with ratio of H 2 O 2 :vanadate of 2 : 1 and above, prevented the reaction. Diperoxovanadate, known to be formed in such reaction mixtures, was ineffective by itself and needed uncomplexed vanadate (V-v) or vanadyl (V-iv) to support bromination. Bromide-assisted reduction of the excess vanadate to vanadyl appeared to be an essential secondary reaction. In the absence <b>of</b> phenol red <b>oxygen</b> was released, and concomitantly bromide was oxidized to a form competent to brominate phenol red <b>added</b> after termination <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> release.
