5000|$|Squawk {{codes are}} four-digit octal numbers; the dials on a {{transponder}} read {{from zero to}} seven, inclusive. Thus the lowest possible squawk is 0000 and the highest is 7777. Four octal digits can represent up to 4096 different codes, which is why such transponders are often called [...] "4096 code transponders." [...] Care must be taken not to squawk any emergency code during a code change. For example, when changing from 1200 to 6501 (an example of an assigned air traffic control squawk), one might turn the second wheel to a 5 (thus 1500), and then rotate the first wheel backwards in the sequence 1-0-7-6 to get to 6. This would momentarily cause the transponder to squawk the code 7500, which is an emergency code signalling to ATC that the aircraft has been hijacked, causing an unnecessary false <b>alarm</b> <b>situation.</b> However, while {{it is important to}} not select an emergency code by mistake, pilots are also instructed to avoid setting the transponder in [...] "standby mode" [...] as a means of avoiding accidental selection, as it causes the loss of target information by ATC. Modern digital transponders allow the direct selection of squawk codes, without having to cycle past other numbers.|$|E

40|$|Today’s {{intensive}} care units monitor patients {{through the use}} of various medical devices, which generate a high ratio of false positive alarms due to a low alarm speciﬁcity.

40|$|Although the {{presence}} of vocal mimicry in songbirds is well documented, the function of such impressive copying is poorly understood. One explanation for mimicry in species that predominantly mimic alarm calls and predator vocal isations is that these birds use mimicry to confuse or deter potential threats or intruders, so these vocalisations should therefore be produced when the mimic is alarmed and be uncommon in other contexts. Male bowerbirds construct bowers to display to females and anecdotal reports from the Ptilonorhynchus genus suggest that males mimic alarm sounds when disturbed at their bowers. We quantified and compared the rate of mimicry during disturbance to the bower by a human and in naturally occurring social contexts in a population of spotted bowerbirds Ptilonorhynchus maculatus. Male bowerbirds produced mimicry more than thirty times more frequently in response to bower disturbance {{than they did in}} any other context. Neither conspecifics nor heterospecifics were attracted to the bower area by mimicry. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the production of mimicry is associated with a response to an <b>alarming</b> <b>situation.</b> Additionally, the predominance of alarm mimicry by spotted bowerbirds raises the possibility that the birds learn these sounds when they experience <b>alarming</b> <b>situations</b> and they reproduce them in subsequent <b>alarming</b> <b>situations.</b> <br /...|$|R

40|$|Project {{background}} Insurance company Achmea {{and consulting}} and IT services company Accenture commenced a collaboration {{in the fall}} of 2015 in an attempt to address burglary damages in social housing apartments. This project was called ‘Homies’. In order to achieve their goal of reducing burglary costs, the Homies team created a concept for an in-home alarm system that warns a network of neighbours, family and friends through messaging service WhatsApp whenever it is triggered. Homies’ working method is based on the ‘Lean Startup’ method: their aim was to start as soon as possible with releasing ‘minimum viable products’ (MVPs) to their (potential) customers and end users. Housing corporation Ymere agreed to participate in pilots, and facilitated the contact with its tenants. For this graduation project, I was able to use Homies’ pilots to test my own interventions and gather insights. Context Break-in-and-entering in homes is a problem of substantial size in the Netherlands, in which socially deprived neighbourhoods suffer disproportionally. There are many stakeholders that are negatively affected by it, among whom victims and their neighbourhoods, governmental institutions, insurers and housing corporations. From my research on how Homies could address this problem, I discerned three major challenges: 1. Decreasing damages from break-in and burglary 2. Availability for social tenants 3. Promoting social cohesion Research process As the Homies concept was already being developed and tested in a pilot at the start of my graduation project, it seemed worthwhile to research the prototype in use, as well as its pilot users. My process consisted of interviews, observations, interventions, simulations with end users and creative sessions. The insights that I gained during this research, were in some cases directly used to alter the Homies concept and prototype (MVP). At the end of this process, I had contributed to an increase in the amount of neighbours that are warned for each alarm from less than one to 5 on average, helped boost the responsiveness of neighbours after an alarm fired and reduce the average time it took to assess if it was false alarm to below three minutes in 90 % of the cases. Key redesign factors My research led me to believe that Homies’ mission and vision for its product and service have clear merits, but there are many factors that could impede success. I defined five key redesign factors, based on my research insights. I addressed these in a redesign for Homies’ service, that focuses mostly on a new interface that is meant to replace WhatsApp. 1. Guide users through alarm situations Departing from the very limited possibilities for guiding alarm situations in WhatsApp, creating a new interface for users during alarm situations opens up many opportunities for Homies to guide their users in the best possible way. The redesign was specifically made to only give each user information that is relevant to them in that exact moment, and to suggest very specific actions that would lead to effective follow-up. Each view of the app is specifically designed to guide the user in taking their next step. As {{a significant part of the}} target group (social tenants) are low-literate, have little experience with technology and mobile phones and are insecure about their capabilities, I aimed for a design with decreased dependence on reading and writing skills, opting to always give users a few clear options for their next action, enhanced with as many visual cues as possible. 2. Provide better insight and oversight for users and Homies By creating a new interface, social translucence can be taken into account specifically. Users will then be better able to work together and account for each other’s needs in the situation. Next to this, each button-press or other interaction within the concept can be captured by Homies and used towards understanding both user behaviour and the specific conditions of each <b>alarm</b> <b>situation,</b> which can be of great value for improving their service: the behaviour of individual users can be tracked back in more detail. Additionally, all aggregated data can be used to show trends and patterns in both user behaviour and <b>alarm</b> <b>situation</b> specifics. Homies can collect statistics on user, home and neighbourhood level and build a system of positive reinforcement for its end users around improving scores. 3. Reduce dependence on third party apps Progressive web apps (PWAs) have the potential to solve Homies’ WhatsApp dependency and improving the alarm follow-up user experience, while also omitting the necessity for a native Homies app for each different smartphone OS. 4. Show users the value of Homies as integral part of the user journey This custom interface that guides users better during the <b>alarm</b> <b>situation,</b> can easily be used during the onboarding process to simulate alarm situations. These simulations could provide a perfect environment for users to be prepared for alarm situations. 5. Engage users effectively over long time spans It is important to keep users effectively engaged throughout their Homies membership, as it is important that, in each <b>alarm</b> <b>situation,</b> enough alarm group members engage in follow-up behaviour, otherwise Homies can’t effectively decrease burglary and fire damages. The onboarding process is designed following the effective engagement model that Yardley et al. (2016) propose: behaviour change is mediated by the digital behaviour change intervention (DBCI), where in the first phase, the DBCI prepares the user for behaviour change in a set of ‘micro’ level moment-to-moment engagements that keep the user come back to the DBCI. Throughout these micro level engagements, the DBCI aims to get the user to identify and engage with the larger intervention goals, which reinforce the user’s motivation to keep engaged on the micro level. The combination of these levels of engagement can then in turn bring the behaviour change about, onto a point where continued engagement with the DBCI is not necessary to keep the behaviour change.

40|$|The {{future of}} traffic {{management}} and highway safety lies in proactive traffic management systems. Crash prediction models that use real-time traffic flow variables measured {{through a series}} of loop detectors are the most important component of such systems. A previous crash prediction model was developed with the matched case-control logistic regression technique. Although the model achieved reasonable classification accuracy, it remained open to improvement because of the limited study area, sample size, and transferability issues. Therefore, the previous work had been extended. Multivehicle freeway crashes under high- and low-speed traffic conditions were found to differ in severity and in their mechanism. The distribution of 5 -min average speeds obtained immediately before the crash from the loop detector station closest to the crash shows two approximate mound-shaped distributions. This distribution is used as the basis to separate the models for crashes occurring under the two speed conditions. The results show that, as expected, variables that entered in the final models (for crashes under high and low speeds) were not the same. However, they were found to be consistent with the probable mechanisms of crashes under the respective speed conditions. A possible implementation of the separate models {{with the use of the}} odds ratios and with the balancing of the threshold between achieving high classification of crash potential and the false <b>alarm</b> <b>situation</b> is presented...|$|E

Forty participants {{were tested in}} a driving simulator and confronted with an inevitable collision. They performed a naïve drive and afterwards a repeated exposure {{in which they were}} told to hold the steering wheel loosely. In a third drive they experienced a false <b>alarm</b> <b>situation.</b> Data on driving behavior, i. e. steering and braking behavior as well as subjective data was assessed in the scenarios. Results showed that most participants held on to the steering wheel strongly or counter-steered during the system intervention during the first encounter. Moreover, subjective data collected after the first drive showed that the majority of drivers was not aware of the system intervention. Data from the repeated drive in which participants were instructed to hold the steering wheel loosely, led to significantly more participants holding the steering wheel loosely and thus complying with the instruction. This study seems to imply that without knowledge and information of the system about an upcoming intervention, the most prevalent driving behavior is a strong reaction with the steering wheel similar to an automatic steering reflex which decreases the system's effectiveness. Results of the second drive show some potential for countermeasures, such as informing drivers shortly before a system intervention in order to prevent inhibiting reactions...|$|E
40|$|The Airport Movement Area Safety System (AMASS), {{currently}} deployed {{at major}} airports around the U. S., monitors aircrafts movement and predicts possible incursion. The incursion prediction involves linear prediction of separation distances between {{a pair of}} aircrafts. A careful safety algorithm uses this prediction, airport configuration, and other environment factors, to determine if incursion is likely and to warn air traffic controllers to perform corrective measures. However, the linear prediction is inaccurate, and thus the safety algorithm generates too many false alarms. We investigate the uses of neural network as an estimation tool {{in place of the}} linear prediction. Previous work has shown that estimation of separation distances at ten seconds in the future by a neural network is more accurate than the existing linear prediction. This paper investigate the possibility of using neural networks to shorten the lead time, the time since the system gives alarming message until the time incursion occurs. A new neural network is optimized to estimate separation distances at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 seconds in the future. The results show that, although the neural network significantly reduces the number of false alarms, it does not alarm in real <b>alarm</b> <b>situation.</b> This is an unacceptable condition as the cost of not detecting real incursion involves hundreds of human lives. The current development of using neural networks to estimate the positions of an aircraft instead of separation distances is more promising and is also discussed. ii TABLE OF CONTENTS 1...|$|E
