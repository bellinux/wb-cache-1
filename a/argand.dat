25|$|The {{source of}} {{illumination}} had generally been wood pyres or burning coal. The <b>Argand</b> lamp, invented in 1782 by the Swiss scientist, Aimé <b>Argand,</b> revolutionized lighthouse illumination with its steady smokeless flame. Early models used ground glass which was sometimes tinted around the wick. Later models used a mantle of thorium dioxide suspended over the flame, creating a bright, steady light. The <b>Argand</b> lamp used whale oil, colza, olive oil or other vegetable oil as fuel which was supplied by a gravity feed from a reservoir mounted above the burner. The lamp was first produced by Matthew Boulton, {{in partnership with}} <b>Argand,</b> in 1784 and became the standard for lighthouses for over a century.|$|E

25|$|With the {{development}} of the steady illumination of the <b>Argand</b> lamp, the application of optical lenses to increase and focus the light intensity became a practical possibility. William Hutchinson developed the first practical optical system in 1763, known as a catoptric system. This rudimentary system effectively collimated the emitted light into a concentrated beam, thereby greatly increasing the light's visibility. The ability to focus the light led to the first revolving lighthouse beams, where the light would appear to the mariners as a series of intermittent flashes. It also became possible to transmit complex signals using the light flashes.|$|E

Mobilism was revived in the 1950 s and 1960 s by measurements of long-term displacement of crustal blocks relative to each other (tectonic displacement) and to Earth's geographic pole (latitudinal displacement). Also, short-term or current displacements can now be measured. I briefly outline the categories of tectonic and current displacement and focus on latitudinal displacement. Integration of tectonic and latitudinal displacement in the early 1970 s completed the new mobilistic paleogeography, in which the transformation of rock magnetization directions into paleopoles and latitudes and the finite rotation of spherical plates about pivot points play complementary roles; this new synthesis now provides a quantitative basis for studying long-term evolution of Earth's surface features and climate, the changing environments in which life evolves...|$|R

Fizemos medidas de susceptibilidade AC em função do campo magnético externo, para várias freqüências do campo de excitação e para temperaturas entre 1. 2 e 2. 5 K. Através dos dados obtidos construímos os chamados D̈iagramas de Argandp̈ara as fases antiferromagnética e paramagnética destes compostos. Os dados obtidos são comparados às previsões dadas pelo modelo de Casimir-Du Pré. Observamos que na fase paramagnética o sistema é bem descrito pelo modelo, enquanto que na fase antiferromagnética isto não ocorre. Segundo previsões devido a Fisher, a susceptibilidade em função da temperatura e a campo constante possui uma contribuição adicional da forma X ANTIND. (T,H) H POT. Y 1.

Using these data we have built the so called <b>Argandś</b> Diagramsf̈or the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases. Our results are compared to the predictions of Casimir-Du Préś model.

2500|$|If {{the above}} theory is true, {{the next stage}} of {{development}} ought to be triple algebra and if [...] truly represents a line in a given plane, it ought to be possible to find a third term which added to the above would represent a line in space. <b>Argand</b> and some others guessed that it was [...] although this contradicts the truth established by Euler that [...] De Morgan and many others worked hard at the problem, but nothing came of it until the problem was taken up by Hamilton. We now see the reason clearly: The symbol of double algebra denotes not a length and a direction; but a multiplier and an angle. In it the angles are confined to one plane. Hence the next stage will be a quadruple algebra, when the axis of the plane is made variable. And this gives the answer to the first question; double algebra is nothing but analytical plane trigonometry, and this is why it {{has been found to be}} the natural analysis for alternating currents. But De Morgan never got this far. He died with the belief that “double algebra must remain as the full development of the conceptions of arithmetic, so far as those symbols are concerned which arithmetic immediately suggests”.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 18th century, two new proofs were {{published}} which did not assume the existence of roots, but neither of which was complete. One of them, due to James Wood and mainly algebraic, was published in 1798 and it was totally ignored. Wood's proof had an algebraic gap. The other one was published by Gauss in 1799 and it was mainly geometric, but it had a topological gap, filled by Alexander Ostrowski in 1920, as discussed in Smale 1981 [...] (Smale writes, [...] "...I wish to point out what an immense gap Gauss' proof contained. It is a subtle point even today that a real algebraic plane curve cannot enter a disk without leaving. In fact even though Gauss redid this proof 50 years later, the gap remained. It was not until 1920 that Gauss' proof was completed. In the reference Gauss, A. Ostrowski has a paper which does this and gives an excellent discussion of the problem as well..."). [...] A rigorous proof was first published by <b>Argand</b> in 1806 (and revisited in 1813); it was here that, for the first time, the fundamental theorem of algebra was stated for polynomials with complex coefficients, rather than just real coefficients. Gauss produced two other proofs in 1816 and another version of his original proof in 1849.|$|E
2500|$|De Morgan's work {{entitled}} Trigonometry and Double Algebra {{consists of}} two parts; the former {{of which is a}} treatise on trigonometry, and the latter a treatise on generalized algebra which he called [...] "double algebra". The first stage in the development of algebra is arithmetic, where numbers only appear and symbols of operations such as , , etc. The next stage is universal arithmetic, where letters appear instead of numbers, so as to denote numbers universally, and the processes are conducted without knowing the values of the symbols. Let [...] and [...] denote any numbers; then such an expression as [...] may be impossible; so that in universal arithmetic there is always a proviso, provided the operation is possible. The third stage is single algebra, where the symbol may denote a quantity forwards or a quantity backwards, and is adequately represented by segments on a straight line passing through an origin. Negative quantities are then no longer impossible; they are represented by the backward segment. But an impossibility still remains {{in the latter part of}} such an expression as [...] which arises in the solution of the quadratic equation. The fourth stage is double algebra. The algebraic symbol denotes in general a segment of a line in a given plane. It is a double symbol because it involves two specifications, namely, length, and direction; and [...] is interpreted as denoting a quadrant. The expression [...] then represents a line in the plane having an abscissa [...] and an ordinate [...] <b>Argand</b> and Warren carried double algebra so far but they were unable to interpret on this theory such an expression as [...] De Morgan attempted it by reducing such an expression to the form , and he considered that he had shown that it could be always so reduced. The remarkable fact is that this double algebra satisfies all the fundamental laws above enumerated, and as every apparently impossible combination of symbols has been interpreted it looks like the complete form of algebra. In chapter6 he introduced hyperbolic functions and discussed the connection of common and hyperbolic trigonometry.|$|E
