5|$|The {{original}} {{target for}} the bomb was the city of Kokura, but it {{was found to be}} obscured by clouds and drifting smoke from fires started by a major firebombing raid by 224 B-29s on nearby Yahata the previous day.

5|$|After {{exceeding}} the original departure time limit by a half-hour, Bockscar, accompanied by The Great Artiste, proceeded to Kokura, thirty minutes away. The delay at the rendezvous {{had resulted in}} clouds and drifting smoke over Kokura from fires started by a major firebombing raid by 224 B-29s on nearby Yahata the previous day. Additionally, the Yawata Steel Works intentionally burned coal tar, to produce black smoke. The clouds and smoke resulted in 70% of the area over Kokura being covered, obscuring the <b>aiming</b> <b>point.</b> Three bomb runs were made over the next 50 minutes, burning fuel and exposing the aircraft repeatedly to the heavy defenses of Yawata, but the bombardier was unable to drop visually.

5|$|Cunningham was {{promoted}} to acting squadron leader in September 1940, commanding B Flight. Within the month the unit received the heavily armed and powerful Bristol Beaufighter. After the commanding officer, Cunningham was the second man to fly it. The Beaufighter went through a teething stage in relation to its gun sight. The sight projected a ring of light with a spot at the centre onto a small sheet of glass {{directly in front of}} the pilots head. The spot in the centre provided the <b>aiming</b> <b>point,</b> and the ring, of variable diameter, helped him to judge the rage and amount of deflection needed to attack a target. The light's brilliance was adjustable by rheostat, but the control was ineffective. Rotating it a fraction could produce maximum brilliance or cause the spot to flicker out.|$|E
40|$|Distribution of {{heliostat}} <b>aim</b> <b>points</b> {{is a major}} task during {{central receiver}} operation, as the flux distribution produced by the heliostats varies continuously with time. Known methods for <b>aim</b> <b>point</b> distribution are mostly based on simple <b>aim</b> <b>point</b> patterns and focus on control strategies to meet local temperature and flux limits of the receiver. Lowering the peak flux on the receiver to avoid hot spots and maximizing thermal output are obviously competing targets that call for a comprehensive optimization process.

5|$|John Ronald Skirth (11 December 1897 – 1977) was a British {{soldier who}} served in the Royal Garrison Artillery during the First World War. His {{experiences}} during the Battle of Messines and the Battle of Passchendaele, both in 1917, led him to resolve not to take human life, {{and for the rest of}} his army service he made deliberate errors in targeting calculations to try to ensure the guns of his battery missed their <b>aiming</b> <b>point</b> on the first attempt, giving the enemy a chance to evacuate. Many years later, after retiring from a career as a teacher, he wrote a memoir of his years in the army, describing his disillusionment with the conduct of the war and his conversion to pacifism. In 2010 the memoir was published as The Reluctant Tommy, edited by Duncan Barrett.|$|E
5|$|The mid- to late 1970s saw the {{introduction}} of what are usually referred to as red dot sights, a type that gives the user a simple bright red dot as an <b>aiming</b> <b>point.</b> The typical configuration for this sight is a compact curved mirror reflector design with a red light-emitting diode (LED) at its focus. Using an LED as a reticle is an innovation that greatly improves the reliability and general usefulness of the sight: {{there is no need}} for other optical elements to focus light behind a reticle; the mirror can use a dichroic coating to reflect just the red spectrum, passing through most other light; and the LED itself is solid state and consumes very little power, allowing battery-powered sights to run for hundreds and even tens of thousands of hours.|$|E
5|$|ZG 26's Bf 110s {{were flying}} near the formation, {{and tried to}} offer JG 3 support by intercepting Crossley's fighters but failed. Crossley led a head-on attack and downed one Do 17 while his {{squadron}} damaged several others. So close had the RAF fighters pressed home their attacks that the bombers had to move and jink to avoid their fire. It put the bomb-aimers off their aim. The Dorniers were already too close to their targets and the pilots could not realign before the formation was over and passed the <b>aiming</b> <b>point.</b> Having been thwarted from bombing their official targets they aimed for rail tracks {{to the north and}} east of the airfield. Some of the unit targeted RAF Croydon, three miles north-west of Biggin Hill. Others turned around without releasing their bombs. The crews that bombed the rail lines found they were a difficult target to hit at 15,000 feet. Some released their bombs at intervals in the hope of hitting their targets, however some bombs fell on residential property.|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the relationships between body sway, <b>aim</b> <b>point</b> fluctuation and performance in rifle shooting on an inter- and intra-individual basis. Six elite shooters performed 20 shots under competition conditions. For each shot, body sway parameters and four <b>aim</b> <b>point</b> fluctuation parameters were quantified for the time periods 5 s to shot, 3 s to shot and 1 s to shot. Three parameters were used to indicate performance. An AMTI LG 6 - 4 force plate {{was used to measure}} body sway parameters, while a SCATT shooting analysis system was used to measure <b>aim</b> <b>point</b> fluctuation and shooting performance. Multiple regression analysis indicated that body sway was related to performance for four shooters. Also, body sway was related to <b>aim</b> <b>point</b> fluctuation for all shooters. These relationships were specific to the individual, with the strength of association, parameters of importance and time period of importance different for different shooters. Correlation analysis of significant regressions indicated that, as body sway increased, performance decreased and <b>aim</b> <b>point</b> fluctuation increased for most relationships. We conclude that body sway and <b>aim</b> <b>point</b> fluctuation are important in elite rifle shooting and performance errors are highly individual-specific at this standard. Individual analysis should be a priority when examining elite sports performance...|$|R

25|$|In September 1943, Arthur Harris, {{convinced}} that a strategic bombing campaign against Germany's cities would force a German collapse, pressed for further mass attacks. While RAF Bomber Command destroyed Hannover's city centre and 86% of crews dropped their bombs within 5km (3mi) of the <b>aiming</b> <b>point,</b> losses were severe. The Ruhr Area was the prime target for British bombers in 1943, and German defences inflicted a considerable loss rate. The Bf 110 {{had a hand in}} the destruction of some 2,751 RAF bombers in 1943, along with German flak and other night fighters.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of quantisation of force plate data used to measure body sway and the relationship between this body sway, <b>aim</b> <b>point</b> fluctuation and performance in shooting. Quantisation error in and resolution of selected body sway parameters were calculated from force plate data sampled using 12 -bit and 16 -bit analog to digital conversion (ADC). It was concluded that 12 -bit ADC does not offer adequate precision when assessing the body sway of shooters and that 16 -bit ADC is required. The relationship between body sway, <b>aim</b> <b>point</b> fluctuation and performance was examined on both group and individual bases. Body sway was measured in six elite rifle and five elite pistol shooters while performing 20 shots in simulated competition conditions over 5 s, 3 s and 1 s before shot using an AMTI LG 6 - 4 force plate and 16 -bit ADC. This was synchronised with a SCATT shooting training analysis system, which measured <b>aim</b> <b>point</b> fluctuation and performance. From 16 time-based body sway parameters quantified, principal components analysis identified four body sway factors, which related to the amplitude and speed of this sway in both the X and Y axis. Using four body sway parameters that represented these factors, correlation and multiple regression analysis indicated that body sway, <b>aim</b> <b>point</b> fluctuation and performance were related for some but not all shooters. Further, this association was specific to the individual shooter in terms of degree and direction of association, the axis of influence of body sway and <b>aim</b> <b>point</b> fluctuation and the time period. This highlighted the importance of individual based analysis in elite shooting. Further research with larger subject numbers, <b>aim</b> <b>point</b> fluctuation more thoroughly examined and including kinematic analysis may assist in better defining the relationship between body sway, <b>aim</b> <b>point</b> fluctuation and performance...|$|R

500|$|Analysis by Operational Research Section Number 2 (ORS2) {{concluded}} that {{the bombing of the}} first <b>aiming</b> <b>point</b> north-west of Caen was accurate, finding that the centre of the 90 percent zone (the area where 90 percent of the bombs fell) was [...] east of the <b>aiming</b> <b>point,</b> with some spillage to the south and west. Examination of the area after its capture, indicated some destruction of German equipment, including the wreckage of ten of the forty trucks believed to be in the area {{at the time of the}} raid. The 48 hours that elapsed between the bombing and the Allied occupation of the area, allowed the Germans time to recover from any shock and disorientation and to salvage some damaged equipment. Examination of the second <b>aiming</b> <b>point,</b> [...] "Northern Caen", failed to reveal a 90 percent zone but it was noted that the obstructive effect of bombing a suburb was significant and had caused substantial delays to vehicles of both sides, by cratering and blocking roads. ORS2 {{concluded that}} the success of Charnwood owed little to the bombing and made recommendations including changing to instantly fused bombs, dropping larger numbers of smaller anti-personnel bombs and rapidly following-up a bombardment with ground forces to take advantage of its main effect, which was the temporary suppression of German will to resist. In Operation Goodwood, Operation Bluecoat, Operation Cobra, Operation Totalize and Operation Tractable the 21st Army Group exploited better the effect of preparatory attacks by strategic bombers by following-up the attacks immediately.|$|E

500|$|The target {{selected}} for the first raid on Japan was the Imperial Iron and Steel Works at Yawata, an industrial city about [...] from Chengdu.

The facility was dependent on three coke plants and the largest of these was selected as the designated <b>aiming</b> <b>point</b> for the B-29s. Nearby Laoyao harbor, which was an important industrial port, was designated as the raid's secondary target. The selection of Yawata's steel works as the first target to be attacked was in accordance with a decision made by the Twentieth Air Force on 1April 1944 which assigned the highest priority to attacking Japan's steel and coke industry. It was decided to conduct the raid at night with each B-29 bombing individually as the aircraft lacked the range needed to conduct a more fuel-intensive formation flight between the forward air bases and Yawata.|$|E

500|$|A {{reflector}} sight or {{reflex sight}} is an optical device {{that allows the}} user to look through a partially reflecting glass element and see an illuminated projection of an <b>aiming</b> <b>point</b> or some other image superimposed {{on the field of}} view. These sights work on the simple optical principle that anything at the focus of a lens or curved mirror (such as an illuminated reticle) will look like it is {{sitting in front of the}} viewer at infinity. Reflector sights employ some sort of [...] "reflector" [...] to allow the viewer to see the infinity image and the field of view at the same time, either by bouncing the image created by lens off a slanted glass plate, or by using a mostly clear curved glass reflector that images the reticle while the viewer looks through the reflector. Since the reticle is at infinity it stays in alignment with the device the sight is attached to regardless of the viewer's eye position, removing most of the parallax and other sighting errors found in simple sighting devices.|$|E
500|$|The {{operation}} order setting {{out how the}} raid was to be conducted was issued by No. 5 Group on 7 September. It stated that Kaafjord {{was believed to be}} protected by 16 heavy and 16 light anti-aircraft guns, as well as Tirpitzs guns, and that it took the defenders ten minutes to cover the battleship with a smokescreen. The attack force was to be organised into two groups. Force A, comprising twelve Lancasters from No. 9 Squadron and an equal number from No. 617 Squadron armed with a single Tallboy each, was to continue to Yagodnik after bombing. Force B was to comprise six Lancasters from each of the squadrons armed with twelve JW mines and return directly to either Scotland or the Shetland Islands. A Lancaster from the RAF Film Unit, which was attached to No. 463 Squadron RAAF, would accompany Force B and also return to the United Kingdom after the bombers completed their attack. It was intended that the attack would be conducted in daylight, and that the Lancasters would assemble into formations near Kaafjord before attacking. If the fjord was covered by cloud or smoke, Force A was ordered to not drop its valuable bombs and continue onto Yagodnik. Force B was directed to drop the JW mines regardless of cloud or smoke cover as long as an <b>aiming</b> <b>point</b> could be identified. The entire attack group was to maintain strict radio silence. Two No. 511 Squadron Consolidated B-24 Liberator transport aircraft were assigned to carry maintenance personnel and supplies from the United Kingdom to Yagodnik, and a Mosquito fitted for photo reconnaissance tasks from No. 540 Squadron would scout ahead of the attack force. All aircrew were briefed on this plan on either 8 or 9 September. Group Captain C.C. McMullen, the commander of No. 9 Squadron's home base of RAF Bardney, was appointed the overall leader of the detachment. No. 617 Squadron's commanding officer, Wing Commander [...] "Willy" [...] Tait, was selected to lead the strike force.|$|E
