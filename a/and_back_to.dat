5|$|Ecclesiastical {{jurisdiction}} over the inhabitants was equally chaotic; it was first placed under the Diocese of Tlaxcala but {{was transferred to the}} Diocese of Guatemala in 1536. The Dominican Order was active in Soconusco {{during the early years of}} colonial rule, but withdrew in 1545 due to the low levels of indigenous population and the unhealthy climate. In 1545 it became a part of the Diocese of Chiapa. It was returned to Guatemala in 1561, <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Chiapa in 1596.|$|E

From Kilindini, in March 1942, the liner sailed to Colombo <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Durban on 8 April. While at Durban, a fire gutted the bridge in {{what may have been}} sabotage.|$|E

Early results showed {{that in addition to}} making the transatlantic crossings about 10% faster than she had before, West Alsek used about 30% less coal during the voyage. West Alsek continued to be a test platform for assessing the pulverized coal system during a voyage to Glasgow, her second for the Oriole Line.|$|E

5|$|After sailing for the Clyde <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> New York in July on {{its first}} mercy mission, Blanche F. Sigman moved to its new homeport of Charleston in August 1944. Sailing later that month, the Sigman headed to the Mersey and Liverpool. In October the ship sailed for Gibraltar, Oran, and Leghorn. In December, it {{repeated}} its previous voyage but also stopped at Naples as well, eventually making its way back to Charleston in January 1945. Throughout 1945, the hospital ship made six transatlantic treks, visiting Marseille three times, Naples, Oran, Gibraltar, Milford Haven, Wales, Avonmouth, Cherbourg, and Horta. The Sigmans sixth mission {{of the year was}} a return trip to Cherbourg that ended with a return to its new homeport of New York.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians have a {{juvenile}} stage and an adult stage, and the circulatory {{systems of the}} two are distinct. In the juvenile (or tadpole) stage, the circulation {{is similar to that}} of a fish; the two-chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated, and is spread around the body <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the heart in a single loop. In the adult stage, amphibians (especially frogs) lose their gills and develop lungs. They have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria. When the ventricle starts contracting, deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs. Continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body. Mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 10,000 people met the Birmingham City {{party on}} {{their return to}} Snow Hill station. The players, {{in the first of}} a convoy of four coaches, waved to the assembled crowds through the open sun-roof as they proceeded to the Council House, where the Lord Mayor welcomed them on behalf of the city. Len Boyd addressed the crowds from the balcony before the coaches continued through the city centre <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> St Andrew's, Birmingham City's home ground. The following Wednesday, a dinner was held to honour the club's achievements. Guests included the 84-year-old Billy Walton, who had joined the club in 1888, six members of Birmingham's 1931 cup final team, and a trade delegation from the Soviet city of Sverdlovsk.|$|E

5|$|Atangana's unfailing {{loyalty and}} subservience to Germany {{prevented}} the French from ever fully trusting him. His first task {{under the new}} colonial regime was to supervise gangs of forced road-construction labourers {{in the town of}} Dschang. In Atangana's absence, the French had appointed a Beti headman named Joseph Atemengue as their local representative in Jaunde (now known by the French spelling, Yaoundé). However, Atemengue never enjoyed the popularity Atangana had among the Beti. Atangana tried to secure an alliance with him by sending his 20-year-old, German-educated daughter, Katerina, to marry him, but she eventually fled from the much older Atemengue <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her father. Atangana's work performance convinced the French to let him return to Yaoundé in late 1921 or early 1922.|$|E
5|$|Back to the Future was {{released}} on July 3, 1985, grossing over $381 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1985. It won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film, and the Academy Award for Best Sound Effects Editing, as well as receiving three additional Academy Award nominations, five BAFTA nominations, and four Golden Globe nominations, including Best Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy).

In 2007, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry, and in June 2008 the American Film Institute's special AFI's 10 Top 10 designated the film as the 10th-best film in the science fiction genre. The film {{marked the beginning of}} a franchise, with two sequels, Back to the Future Part II (1989) <b>and</b> <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> the Future Part III (1990), as well as an animated series, , several video games and a forthcoming musical.|$|E
5|$|Business US Highway 127 (Bus. US127) is a {{business}} loop that runs from an interchange on US127 on the southern Ithaca city limits through downtown <b>and</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the freeway north of the city. The southern end is at exit117 on US127, and from there, the business loop runs westward along Center Street through a cluster of businesses adjacent to the freeway interchange. Further west, Bus. US127 passes through residential neighborhoods to enter downtown Ithaca. At Main Street, the business loop turns northward one block to Emerson, then turns westward one block along Emerson to Pine River Street, bypassing downtown Ithaca. From there, Bus. US127 turns northward along the former route of US27 through town. North of downtown, the highway passes through another residential area before exiting Ithaca. North of town, the business loop passes a golf course before turning eastward a short distance along Polk Road to connect to the freeway.|$|E
