5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have never seen <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. They are looking at sexual education. They are looking at the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E

A fortnight later against Hampshire he claimed a career-best 7-51, {{but he was never}} to achieve <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> success again, taking more than one wicket in only two more games. He did, however, manage his modest best score with the bat (28) against Lancashire in July.|$|E

She was never publicly seen drinking and driving or wearing really scandalous clothes or <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> I feel like she set a really great example and she was extremely talented."

500|$|Over {{two games}} in April 2006, Pujols hit home runs in four {{consecutive}} plate appearances, making him the 20th player to accomplish the feat. Pujols maintained after the game {{that he was more}} concerned with winning than the numbers: [...] "I don't look at numbers", he said. [...] "I don't know. I didn't know anything about [...] until you guys brought it up. Because that's not me. I don't get locked in on numbers.

And {{literally}} we came out the door and it was like just hundreds of people sort of coming around us. People everywhere, cameras, people yelling her name.

500|$|Vocalist Karl Willetts of {{the death}} metal band Bolt Thrower asserts the record was an {{inspiration}} for the band: [...] "When Slayer's Haunting the Chapel came out I had never heard <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> before with that style of guitar playing. We were punks and heavy metal was alien to our upbringing. And other bands we heard like Venom, Slaughter and Metallica.

500|$|The Coens, however, {{have denied}} any intent {{to create a}} {{systematic}} unity from symbols in the film. [...] "We never, ever go into our films with <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> in mind", Joel said in a 1998 interview. [...] "There's never anything approaching that kind of specific intellectual breakdown. It's always a bunch of instinctive things that feel right, for whatever reason". The Coens have noted their comfort with unresolved ambiguity. Ethan said in 1991: [...] "Barton Fink does end up telling you what's going on {{to the extent that}} it's important to know...

500|$|During the 2010–11 season, the Capitals {{participated in}} the 2011 NHL Winter Classic against the Pittsburgh Penguins at Heinz Field, Pittsburgh. Leading up to the game, both teams were {{featured}} on HBO's 24/7, which offered a behind-the-scenes look at both teams as they prepared. Laich refused to blame {{the presence of the}} cameras for the team's losing streak, saying, [...] "There's no using the HBO cameras as a crutch or an annoyance or <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> There's no excuse. I don't think HBO has played any bit of an ounce in how things have gone the last two weeks."

500|$|Their fourth album Suck It and See {{sees the}} band {{exploring}} styles, mixing them with newfound maturity. Turner said: [...] "I think {{the new album}} is a balance between our first three. There's nothing about taxi ranks or <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> but there's {{a bit of the}} standpoint I had on those early songs and the sense of humour, but also there's a bit of the 'Humbug' stuff which is kind of off in the corners." [...] Critics noted an influence from British rock bands from the 1960s, as well as The Smiths, and slower, love-themed ballads featured more heavily on the album than the fast-paced, rockier songs that typifies the band's sound. Turner wrote much of the album in his apartment on an acoustic guitar, further influencing the ballad-style prevalent on the album.|$|E

500|$|Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick was {{considered}} the key player for the Virginia Tech offense heading into the Gator Bowl.

On the ground, he ran for 370yards and six touchdowns. Prior to the Gator Bowl, he pledged that he would return for another season at Virginia Tech before entering the NFL draft.

500|$|Murphy has {{clashed with}} Stephen Maguire, {{another of the}} 2000 Young Players of Distinction, on several occasions. At the start of their 2004 Grand Prix match, there was an {{incident}} that resulted in Maguire being docked the opening frame. After they had shaken hands {{at the outset of}} the first frame, Maguire asked referee Johan Oomen for permission to leave the arena and retrieve his chalk, which he had forgotten. While Maguire was away, the referee and Murphy spoke before tournament director Mike Ganley arrived on the scene and docked Maguire a frame for technically not being ready to start at the scheduled time, which angered and surprised Maguire. Murphy refutes that the docking of the frame was down to him speaking to the referee. Maguire won the match 5–2 and later commented: [...] "Rules are rules but I've never heard of <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> happening before".|$|E

I knew it every time, and every time I said it I was shaking." [...] He continued, [...] "Oh it was dreadful. I mean I don't get nervous when I go on stage or <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> {{but it was just}} bizarre. It {{was one of those things}} that I got really nervous about." [...] The on-screen romance was part of a controversial New Year's Eve storyline which featured the two characters attempting to see in 2010 by losing their virginities, only to be discovered by Ryan's adoptive mother Michelle.
