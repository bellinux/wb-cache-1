We report here on the first three generation familial case of BDMR syndrome with inheritance of an interstitial microdeletion of chromosome 2 q 37. 3. The deletion was detected by array comparative genomic hybridization and comprises the HDAC 4 gene and two other genes. The patients of this pedigree show a variable severity of psychomotor and behavioural abnormalities in combination with a specific facial dysmorphism but without BDE. Given that {{only about half of}} the patients with 2 q 37 deletions have BDE; we compared our patients with other patients carrying 2 q 37. 3 deletions or HDAC 4 mutations known from the literature to discuss the diagnostic relevance of the facial dysmorphism pattern in 2 q 37. 3 deletion cases involving the HDAC 4 gene.

40|$|Somatic GNAS point mutations, {{commonly}} known as gsp mutations, {{are involved in the}} pathogenesis of McCune <b>Albright</b> <b>syndrome</b> and have also been described in autonomous hormone-producing tumors, such as somatotropinoma, corticotrophoma, thyroid cancer, ovarian and testicular Leydig cell tumors and primary macronodular adrenocortical hyperplasia (PMAH). [1 - 3]The involvement of gsp mutations in adrenal tumors was first described by Lyons et al. in 1990. Since then, several studies have detected the presence of gsp mutations in adrenal tumors, but none of them could explain its presence along or the mechanism that leads to tumor formation and hormone hypersecretion. As a result, the molecular pathogenesis of the majority of sporadic adrenocortical tumors remains unclear. [3] PMAH has also been reported with gsp somatic mutations in a few cases. Fragoso et al. in 2003 identified two distinct gsp somatic mutations affecting arginine residues on codon 201 of GNAS in a few patients with PMAH who lacked any features or manifestations of McCune <b>Albright</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Followed by this discovery, other studies have continued looking for gsp mutations based on strong prior evidence demonstrating that increased cAMP signaling is sufficient for cell proliferation and cortisol production. [2, 4] With consideration for the previously reported findings, we conjecture that although somatic activating mutations in GNAS are a rare molecular event, these mutations could probably be sufficient to induce the development of macronodule hyperplasia and variable cortisol secretion.

PHP type 1 B (PHP 1 B), caused by epigenetic changes in the GNAS locus, was initially described as an isolated resistance to PTH. Epigenetic changes in GNAS have also been reported in patients who display mild Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy or mild thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) resistance without mutation of GNAS. Here we report a case of PHP caused by epigenetic changes in GNAS in a patient with congenital hypothyroidism. The patient was referred for a positive newborn screening for hypothyroidism (TSH 50 mIU/L). She exhibited severe clinical features of congenital hypothyroidism. The thyroid was in place, and etiologic explorations were negative. TSH was normalized under L-thyroxin, and the symptoms disappeared, except for a macroglossia. In childhood, PHP was suspected in addition to elevated PTH, obesity, brachydactyly, and a rounded face. Sequencing, methylation analysis, and large deletion research were performed in GNAS. No genetic mutations were found. Methylation analysis revealed a broad epigenetic defect without deletion in GNAS consistent with sporadic PHP 1 B. The multilocus methylation analysis were negative.

These tumors have more aggressive features than sporadic acromegaly, including a younger age at disease onset and larger tumor size, and they can be challenging to manage.

40|$|Background: McCune <b>Albright</b> <b>syndrome</b> (MAS), a {{disorder}} caused by somatic activating mutations in the GNAS gene, usually presents with cutaneous, skeletal, and endocrine manifestations. While focal lesions involving multiple tissues {{have been identified}} in MAS, almost nothing is known about gastrointestinal lesions in this disease. Methods: Two MAS patients with perioral freckling, resembling Peutz–Jeghers syndrome (PJS), and two MAS patients without similar pigmentation underwent gastrointestinal endoscopy to establish if they had coexisting hamartomatous polyposis. Three of 4 subjects had documented GNAS mutations in peripheral blood. Genetic testing for STK 11 and PRKAR 1 A genes was performed to exclude presence of coexistent PJS and Carney complex. Genetic testing of biopsy material was also performed. Results: Hamartomatous gastrointestinal polyps with histological features similar to those in PJS were observed in all 4 subjects, only in the stomach and/or upper duodenum. Activating GNAS mutations were found in the polyps or adjacent mucosa in 3 of 4 subjects. One patient each had mutation only in the blood or tissue, while 2 patients had both. No subject harboured any detectable PRKARIA or STK 11 mutation as determined by direct DNA sequencing and copy number variation analysis. Conclusions: These findings confirm that gastrointestinal polyps are a common manifestation of MAS, indicate an overlap between MAS and PJS, and point towards a putative interaction between the GNAS and STK 11 genes in the pathogenesis of these two disorders. The findings suggest a need for routine gastrointestinal endoscopy in patients with MAS, to establish the true incidence of polyps in these patients...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to characterize the epidemiological and clinical features of craniomaxillofacial FD by presenting data from a representative Chinese population during a 15 -year period (1994 – 2009). Method The craniomaxillofacial disease registries of two Chinese tertiary referral hospitals (Shanghai Ninth People’s Hospital and Stomatological hospital of Jiangsu Province) were searched and reviewed to collect relevant information for patients with craniomaxillofacial FD between Jan. 1994 and Dec. 2009. All included cases were further analyzed with regard to associated epidemiological and clinicopathological variables. Results A total number of 266 cases with definitive diagnosis were identified with 219 primary cases and 47 recurrent cases. There were 111 males and 155 females with a male to female ratio of 0. 716 : 1. They were clinically categorized into three groups: monostotic (71. 1 %), polysotic (27. 4 %) and <b>Albright</b> <b>syndrome</b> (1. 5 %). Maxilla alone or with adjacent bones was the most common affected site. The serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in patients was much higher than that in healthy control, whereas comparable between primary patients and recurrent ones.

40|$|International audience: Context: McCune <b>Albright</b> <b>syndrome</b> (MAS) is a {{clinical}} association of endocrine and non-endocrine anomalies caused by post-zygotic mutation of the GNAS 1 gene, leading to somatic {{activation of the}} stimulatory α subunit of G protein (Gsα). Important advances have been made recently in describing pathological characteristics of many MAS-affected tissues, particularly pituitary, testicular and adrenal disease. Other rarer disease related features are emerging. Objective: To study pathological and genetic findings of MAS on a tissue-by-tissue basis in classically and non classically affected tissues. Design: A comprehensive autopsy and genetic analysis Setting: Tertiary referral University Hospital Patients: Adult male patient with MAS and severe disease burden including gigantism Intervention(s) : Clinical, hormonal and radiographic studies; gross and microscopic pathology analyses, conventional PCR and droplet digital PCR analyses of affected and non affected tissues Main Outcome Measure: Pathological findings, presence of GNAS 1 mutations Results: The patient was diagnosed with MAS syndrome at six years of age based on the association of café-au-lait spots and radiological signs of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. Gigantism developed and hyperprolactinemia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and hyperparathyroidism were diagnosed throughout adult period. The patient {{died at the age}} of 39 from pulmonary embolism. A detailed study revealed mosaiscism for the p. R 201 C GNAS mutation distributed across many endocrine and non-endocrine tissues. These genetically implicated tissues included rare or previously undescribed disease associations including primary hyperparathyroidism, and hyperplasia of the thymus and endocrine pancreas.
