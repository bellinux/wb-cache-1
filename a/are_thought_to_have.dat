5|$|Although Mirza, Microcebus, and Allocebus form a clade within Cheirogaleidae, {{the three}} {{lineages}} <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> diverged during a narrow window of time, so the relationships within this clade {{are difficult to}} determine and may change with further research. All three <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> diverged at least 20mya (million years ago), although another estimate using mtDNA places the divergence between Mirza and Microcebus at 24.2mya. Divergence between the two recognized species of giant mouse lemur is estimated at 2.1mya.|$|E
5|$|All known extinct lemurs from Madagascar {{are known}} from recent, subfossil remains. Conditions for fossilization were not ideal on the island, so {{little is known}} about ancestral lemur populations. All known extinct lemurs <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> died out after the arrival of humans.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} Estrildines, these species <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{originated}} in Asia. The species {{has been introduced}} {{to other parts of}} the world due to its popularity as a cage bird and populations have established in the wild.|$|E

5|$|Leeds <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{the site}} of the Roman town of Cambodunum, {{abandoned}} when the Romans left Britain in around 400AD. The first church in Leeds <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> built around 600AD.|$|R
5000|$|Castle Sween {{takes its}} name from Suibhne, whose name was Anglicised as [...] "Sween". He <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> built the castle. Suibhne <b>was</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a {{grandson}} of Hugh the Splendid O'Neill who died in 1047.|$|R
5|$|Comets can loosely {{be divided}} into two categories: short-period and long-period—the latter being thought to {{originate}} in the Oort cloud. The two major categories of short-period comets are Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) and Halley-type comets. Halley-type comets, which are named after their prototype, Halley's Comet, <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> originated in the Oort cloud but to have been drawn into the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, whereas the JFCs <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> originated in the scattered disc. The centaurs are thought to be a dynamically intermediate stage between the scattered disc and the Jupiter family.|$|E
5|$|Plazas A and B <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{comprised}} {{a single}} complex {{belonging to the}} Sotz'il clan and included the palace of the Ahpo Sotz'il. Plaza A possesses a ballcourt, two temples and ten palace structures, five of which are interconnecting.|$|E
5|$|Several non-Shakespearean moments <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{been added}} to Macbeth around 1618 and include all of 3.5 and 4.1.39–43 and 4.1.125-32, {{as well as two}} songs.|$|E
50|$|Aegyptopithecus <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> an {{arboreal}} quadruped due to {{the distal}} articular region of the femur, which is deeper than that of “later” catarrhines. Also, based on overall femoral morphology, A. zeuxis <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> robust.|$|R
50|$|Few {{historical}} records exist, although it <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{owned by a}} William Smith, and is known <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been present on the first Ordnance Survey map of the region in 1872. It <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> abandoned by 1877.|$|R
50|$|Aegyptopitheccus zeuxis <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> sexually dimorphic. Tooth size, craniofacial morphology, brain size, {{and body}} mass all {{indicate}} this. Due to A. zeuxis being sexually dimorphic, {{the social structure}} <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> polygynous with intense competition for females.|$|R
5|$|With its low-crowned teeth, Ferugliotherium {{may have}} been an {{insectivore}} or omnivore, like similar multituberculates such as Mesodma, which is thought to have eaten insects, other arthropods, seeds, and/or nuts. The wear on Ferugliotherium teeth suggests that the animal may have eaten some plant material. The high-crowned sudamericids <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been herbivores feeding on abrasive vegetation, although their precise diet is not known. In the evolutionary history of gondwanatheres, hypsodont teeth <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> evolved from brachydont precursors. Gurovich hypothesizes that the anterior molariforms of sudamericids may have evolved from bladelike premolars as seen in Ferugliotherium.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{creation}} of literature was predominantly a male scribal pursuit, some works <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been written by women. For example, several references to women writing letters and surviving private letters sent and received by women have been found. However, Edward F. Wente asserts that, even with explicit references to women reading letters, {{it is possible that}} women employed others to write documents.|$|E
5|$|Anomalocaridids, such as Anomalocaris, were {{organism}}s {{thought to}} be distantly related to the arthropods. These creatures looked quite unlike any organism living today—they had segmented exoskeletons, with lateral lobes used for swimming, typically large compound eyes, often set on stalks, and most strikingly, a pair of large, claw-like great appendages that resembled headless shrimp. These appendages <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> passed food to the animal's mouth, which resembled a ring of sliced pineapple.|$|E
5000|$|Simwonsa Temple (Korean: 심원사, Chinese: 深源寺, Pronounced “Seem-won-sa”) <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{established}} {{around the}} 8th century. The above poem written by Yi Sung-in {{describes it as}} an ancient temple, so it <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> existed long before the Goryeo era.|$|R
500|$|The ancestral lemur that colonized Madagascar <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{small and}} nocturnal. [...] More specifically, it <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had adapiform-like cranial anatomy—particularly the cranial {{foramina}} {{and the middle}} ear—comparable to that of lemurids, while being similar to cheirogaleids in dentition and postcranial anatomy.|$|R

5|$|Glamorgan {{sausages}} <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been originally {{made with}} Glamorgan cheese {{which is no}} longer made due to the near-extinction of the Glamorgan cattle from which it was produced. They rose in popularity during the Second World War due to rationing limiting the volume of meat. The Welsh Gas Board promoted the sausage in a cookbook published in the 1950s, in which it did not specify the type of cheese to be used.|$|E
5|$|Hill plotted {{the remains}} of 102 lodges. Pike {{reported}} finding 44 lodges at the village; the difference is {{probably due to the}} abandonment or destruction of lodges and the building of new ones on different sites. At least 90 graves have been investigated by archaeologists; an estimated 75–100 additional graves <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been opened by relic hunters.|$|E
5|$|In {{order of}} their {{distance}} from the planet, the irregular moons are Triton, Nereid, Halimede, Sao, Laomedeia, Psamathe, and Neso, a group that includes both prograde and retrograde objects. The five outermost moons {{are similar to the}} irregular moons of other giant planets, and <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been gravitationally captured by Neptune, unlike the regular satellites, which probably formed in situ.|$|E

5|$|Malaria parasites contain apicoplasts, organelles {{usually found}} in plants, {{complete}} {{with their own}} genomes. These apicoplasts <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> originated through the endosymbiosis of algae and {{play a crucial role}} in various aspects of parasite metabolism, such as fatty acid biosynthesis. Over 400 proteins have been found to be produced by apicoplasts and these are now being investigated as possible targets for novel anti-malarial drugs.|$|E
5|$|Recently, {{researchers}} described galaxies called super-luminous spirals. They {{are very}} large with an upward diameter of 437,000 light-years (compared to the Milky Way's 100,000 light-year diameter). With {{a mass of}} 340 billion solar masses, they generate {{a significant amount of}} ultraviolet and mid-infrared light. They <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an increased star formation rate around 30 times faster than the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|The ancestral {{function}} of the RNAi system is generally agreed to have been immune defense against exogenous genetic elements such as transposons and viral genomes. Related functions such as histone modification may have already been present in the ancestor of modern eukaryotes, although other functions such as regulation of development by miRNA <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> evolved later.|$|E

5|$|The larvae of {{railroad}} worms (Phrixothrix) have paired photic organs on each body segment, able to glow with green light; these <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a defensive purpose. They also have organs {{on the head}} which produce red light; {{they are the only}} terrestrial organisms to emit light of this colour.|$|E
5|$|The longest living eastern {{green mamba}} was a captive {{specimen}} which lived for 18.8 years. Another captive specimen lived for 14 years. However, {{while it may}} be possible for wild specimens to live that long, they <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> shorter lifespans in general due to the threats of predation, habitat loss, disease, and other biological and environmental factors.|$|E
5|$|The outer, {{irregular}} moons <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{originated from}} captured asteroids, whereas the protolunar disk was still massive enough to absorb {{much of their}} momentum and thus capture them into orbit. Many {{are believed to have}} broken up by mechanical stresses during capture, or afterward by collisions with other small bodies, producing the moons we see today.|$|E
