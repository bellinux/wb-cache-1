5|$|The {{cooperation}} between the Reich Ministry of Aviation, the Ministry of Armaments and the SS proved especially productive. Although intended to function for only six months, already in late May Speer and Milch discussed with Goring the possibility of centralising all of Germany's arms manufacturing under a similar task force. On 1 August 1944, Speer reorganised the Jägerstab into the Rüstungsstab (Armament Staff) to <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> model of operation to all top-priority armament programs.|$|E

25|$|Moran asked Lafarge's {{doctors to}} perform a {{post-mortem}} examination on Lafarge. He had also learned of a new test {{for the presence of}} arsenic that pathologists in Paris were using and asked Lafarge's doctors if they could <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> test in this case. Dr. Lespinasse hastily replied that they could, hiding their ignorance of the test and the intricacies of its procedure.|$|E
25|$|As we can <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{process for}} {{determining}} if M prints 1 infinitely often. When we combine these processes, {{we can determine}} that M does, or does not, go on printing 1’s and 0’s ad infinitum. Thus we have a method for determining if M is circle-free. By Proof 1 this is impossible. So the first assertion that E exists, is wrong: E does not exist.|$|E

25|$|The United Nations, Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) {{predicted}} that 18% of anthropogenic greenhouse gases come {{directly or indirectly}} from the world’s livestock. This report also suggested that the emissions from livestock were {{greater than that of}} the transportation sector. While livestock do currently play a role in producing greenhouse gas emissions, the estimates have been argued to be a misrepresentation. While the FAO used a life cycle assessment of animal agriculture (i.e. all aspects including emissions from growing crops for feed, transportation to slaughter, etc.), they did not <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> assessment for the transportation sector.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{does not}} specify how one should alphabetize the letter ü {{when used in}} other languages than German, but at least as regards the Estonian or Hungarian ü, it seems consistent to treat it as equivalent to y (and even more so, since ü in Estonian and Hungarian is not considered a mere variant of u, {{as it is in}} German). It would seem problematic, however, to <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> principle to e.g. ü (u-diaeresis) as used in Spanish or õ (nasal vowel) as used in Portuguese, as these letters represent quite different orthographic traditions.|$|E

25|$|It is {{important}} to consider the context in which these terms appear in the stories since, as a writer of fiction, Tolkien's primary purpose is to engage and entertain the reader while not being tied to a set terminology the way a military historian must be. Tolkien sometimes adopts just that historian stance going into great detail about tactical movements, weapons and formations as he does in The Battles of the Fords of Isen, or Cirion and Eorl. He can <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> attention to detail to the drill of a shield-wall formation as to the intricacies of family relationships of the Sackville-Baggins.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary {{psychology}} is a theoretical {{approach in the}} social and natural sciences that examines psychological structure from a modern evolutionary perspective. It seeks to identify which human psychological traits are evolved adaptations – that is, the functional products of natural selection or sexual selection in human evolution. Adaptationist thinking about physiological mechanisms, such as the heart, lungs, and immune system, is common in evolutionary biology. Some evolutionary psychologists <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> thinking to psychology, arguing that the modularity of mind {{is similar to that of}} the body and with different modular adaptations serving different functions. Evolutionary psychologists argue that much of human behavior is the output of psychological adaptations that evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments.|$|E
25|$|Chomsky {{explains}} {{his decision to}} focus on criticizing the U.S. over other countries as being because, during his lifetime, the country has militarily and economically dominated the world, and because its liberal democratic electoral system allows for the citizenry to exert an influence on government policy. His hope is that, by spreading awareness of the negative impact that imperialism has on the populations affected by it, he can sway {{the population of the}} U.S. and other countries into opposing government policies that are imperialist in their nature. He urges people to criticize the motivations, decisions, and actions of their governments; to accept responsibility for one's own thoughts and actions; and to <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> standards to others as one would apply to oneself.|$|E

25|$|A union may, in {{some limited}} circumstances, require {{employees}} to exhaust any internal appeals procedures provided under the union's constitution before filing suit. Unions and employers may also generally require employees to exhaust their {{rights under the}} grievance arbitration procedures provided for under {{the collective bargaining agreement}} before suing the employer for breach of contract. However employees do not usually have to exhaust such procedures if they are suing only the union, since very few collective bargaining agreements even allow for the filing of a grievance against the union by covered employees. To the extent that an employee might have a breach of contract claim against a union arising out of its performance of its duty to represent that employee, the courts will <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> deferential standards and procedural requirements that they would employ if the worker sued the union on a breach of the duty of fair representation theory.|$|E
25|$|The {{search for}} new {{supplies}} of water led engineers {{at the turn of}} the century to exploit the open expanses of the Upper Rock, where catchments were constructed by clearing vegetation and sealing fissures with cement or grout. This formed smooth expanses of rock, serving as runoff areas that could direct water into channels. Such catchments were primarily used by the military to provide water to the otherwise hard-to-supply batteries and outposts that existed in numerous places around the Upper Rock. In 1903, the city's Chief Engineer came up with a plan to <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> principle on a massive scale on the Great Gibraltar Sand Dune along the precipitous east side of the Rock in the Sandy Bay area. The 10 acre slope, which has an incline of 35°, was covered with corrugated iron sheets attached to a timber framework. It used an average of 2,400 sheets per acre.|$|E
25|$|The Toronto, Grey and Bruce and the Toronto and Nipissing Railways were promoted, at {{the same}} time, and with similar objectives, by an {{interlocking}} group of Ontario businessmen and politicians. It {{is not surprising that}} the group should economise by employing one Chief Engineer who would <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> design principles and choices on both lines. The first consulting Engineer in Canada was John Edward Boyd of New Brunswick, who conducted the preliminary surveys over the ground to Orangeville and Uxbridge. Douglas Fox came to Canada several times in 1868 and 1869 to support the parliamentary campaign and verify the surveys. On his return to England in the summer of 1869 he made arrangements for an associate, Edmund Wragge, to come to Canada at once to take up the engineering of both lines. In August Wragge visited Pihl in Norway to see his narrow-gauge lines, and arrived in Toronto in September 1869. The tenders for the first sections of line were immediately put out.|$|E

25|$|When moving or copying files, Windows Explorer {{displays}} the full source and destination path, size {{and number of}} items and the transfer speed in megabytes per second (MB/s). If a conflict or error is encountered, it does not terminate the copy, move or delete operation. Rather, the file is skipped {{and the rest of}} the files processed. At the end of the operation, the errors are presented to the user with resolution options (if available). If two files have the same name, an option is available to rename the file; in previous versions of Windows, the only options were to either replace the destination file or cancel the process. The user can also choose to <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> action to further conflicts, if any. Also, for the first time in Windows, processing of dates when moving trees is somewhat consistent. Until now, every folder and subfolder obtained all three dates new to the time of operation. This was from the own nature of the operation at the file system level, create destination folders, move files, delete origin folders. Moved folders in Vista preserve creation and modification dates. Access date gets the time of the operation.|$|E
25|$|Opponents of D.C. {{voting rights}} {{point out that}} Congress appropriates money {{directly}} to the D.C. government to help offset some of the city's costs. However, proponents of a tax-centric view against D.C. representation do not <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> logic to the 32 states that received more money {{from the federal government}} in 2005 than they paid in taxes. Additionally, the federal government is exempt from paying city property taxes and the Congress prohibits the District from imposing a commuter tax on non-residents who work in the city. Limiting these revenue sources strains the local government's finances. Like the 50 states, D.C. receives federal grants for assistance programs such as Medicare, accounting for approximately 26% of the city's total revenue. Congress also appropriates money to the District's government to help offset some of the city's security costs; these funds totaled $38million in 2007, approximately 0.5% of the District's budget. In addition to those funds, the U.S. government provides other services. For example, the federal government operates the District's court system, which had a budget of $272million in 2008. Additionally, all federal law enforcement agencies, such as the U.S. Park Police, have jurisdiction in the city and help provide security. In total, the federal government provided about 33% of the District's general revenue. On average, federal funds formed about 30% of the states' general revenues in 2007.|$|E
25|$|High-quality {{compound}} fertilizers containing nitrogen co-granulated {{with other}} components such as phosphates {{have been produced}} routinely since {{the beginnings of the}} modern fertilizer industry, but on account of the low melting point and hygroscopic nature of urea it took courage to <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> kind of technology to granulate urea on its own. But {{at the end of the}} 1970s three companies began to develop fluidized-bed granulation. The first in the field was Nederlandse Stikstof Maatschappij, which later became part of Hydro Agri (now Yara International). Yara eventually sold this technology to Uhde GmbH, whose Uhde Fertilizer Technology (UFT) subsidiary now markets it. Around the same time Toyo Engineering Corporation developed its spouted-bed process, comprising a fluidized bed deliberately agitated to produce turbulent ebullation. Stamicarbon also undertook development work on its own fluidized-bed granulation system, using film sprays rather than atomizing sprays to introduce the urea melt, but shelved it until the 1990s, when there was for a time considerable doubt about the commercial future of the Hydro (UFT) process. As a result, the Stamicarbon technology is now commercialized and highly successful. More recently, Urea Casale introduced a different fluidized-bed granulation system: the urea is sprayed in laterally from the side walls of the granulator instead of from the bottom. This organizes the bed into two cylindrical masses contrarotating on parallel longitudinal axes. The raw product is uniform enough to not require screens.|$|E
