25|$|After a fruitless {{search for}} work in New York, Kelly {{returned}} to Pittsburgh to his first position as a choreographer with the Charles Gaynor musical revue Hold Your Hats at the Pittsburgh Playhouse in April 1938. Kelly appeared in six of the sketches, one of which, La cumparsita, became {{the basis of an}} extended Spanish number in the film Anchors <b>Aweigh</b> eight years later.|$|E
25|$|Best {{known today}} for his {{performances}} in {{films such as}} An American in Paris (1951), Anchors <b>Aweigh</b> (1945), and Singin' in the Rain (1952), he starred in musical films until they fell out of fashion in the late 1950s. He starred in many musical films throughout the 1940s, including For Me and My Gal (1942), Du Barry Was a Lady (1943), Thousands Cheer (1943), and On the Town (1949). He starred as {{the lead in the}} film It's Always Fair Weather (1955), which has gained a cult following among musical enthusiasts and his fans. In his later career, he starred in two films outside the musical genre: Inherit the Wind (1960) and What a Way to Go! (1964). Throughout his career, he also directed films (some of which he starred in), most notably the 1969 film Hello, Dolly!, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.|$|E
500|$|Donen and Kelly's films set new {{standards}} for special effects, animation, editing and cinematography. Their first collaboration Cover Girl firmly established their intentions, {{particularly in the}} [...] "Alter Ego" [...] dance sequence. It employed a special effect {{that could not be}} achieved with a live take, while advancing the story and revealing the character's inner conflict. Donen and Kelly tested the limits of film's potential with the Jerry the Mouse dance in Anchors <b>Aweigh,</b> one of the time's most sophisticated combinations of live action and animation.|$|E
500|$|In 1945, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cast Sinatra {{opposite}} Gene Kelly and Kathryn Grayson in the Technicolor musical Anchors <b>Aweigh,</b> {{in which}} he played a sailor on leave in Hollywood for four days. A major success, it garnered several Academy Award wins and nominations, and the song [...] "I Fall in Love Too Easily", sung by Sinatra in the film, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. In 1946, Sinatra briefly appeared {{at the end of}} Richard Whorf's commercially successful Till the Clouds Roll By, a Technicolor musical biopic of Jerome Kern, {{in which he}} sang [...] "Ol' Man River.|$|E
500|$|Kelly {{made his}} Hollywood film debut in For Me and My Gal (1942), co-starring with Judy Garland. Afterward, {{he went on}} to work as an actor, dancer and subsequently, choreographer, in a series of musical films. In these films, his choreography {{included}} experiments with a combination of dance and animation (Anchors <b>Aweigh</b> and Invitation to the Dance) and dance scenes involving special effects (including the [...] "Alter Ego" [...] number from Cover Girl and the split-screen dance number from It's Always Fair Weather). In addition to his work as an actor and choreographer, Kelly directed or co-directed several films, some of which did not feature him in an acting role. Kelly appeared in several non-musical dramatic and comedy films as well.|$|E
500|$|In 1957, Barbera reteamed {{with his}} former partner Hanna to produce cartoon films for {{television}} and theatrical release. As they had at MGM, the two brought their different skills to the company; Barbera was a skilled gag writer and sketch artist, while Hanna had a gift for timing, story construction, and recruiting top artists. Major business decisions would be made together, though each year the title of president alternated between them. [...] A coin toss determined that Hanna would have precedence in the naming of the new company, first called H-B Enterprises but soon changed to Hanna-Barbera Productions. Barbera and Hanna's MGM colleague George Sidney, the director of Anchors <b>Aweigh,</b> became the third partner and business manager in the company, and arranged a deal for distribution and working capital with Screen Gems, the television division of Columbia Pictures, who took part ownership of the new studio.|$|E
500|$|In 1944 Donen and Kelly choreographed {{the musical}} Anchors <b>Aweigh,</b> {{released}} by MGM in 1945 and starring Kelly and Frank Sinatra. The most famous scene {{in this film}} is when Kelly dances with the cartoon mouse Jerry. The animation was supervised by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera and is credited to cartoonist Fred Quimby, but {{the idea for the}} scene was Donen's. Originally Donen and Kelly wanted to use either Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck for the sequence and met with Walt Disney to discuss the project. At the time Disney was working on a similar idea in The Three Caballeros and was unwilling to allow one of his characters to appear in an MGM film. They spent two months shooting Kelly's dancing and Donen spent a year perfecting the scene frame by frame. According to Barbera [...] "the net result at the preview of Anchors Away that I went to, blew the audience away." ...|$|E
500|$|On 1 February Missouri {{was finally}} freed with the {{assistance}} of 23 vessels. Five tug boats pulled alongside, six pulled astern, and three swung to the bow to facilitate movement. Additionally, two Gypsy-class salvage vessels, [...] and , and seven yard tugs helped keep the other vessels in place. Kedge anchors were also used to expedite the process. About the time that Missouri began to move again, she suffered one last incident: while being towed off the shoal, she bumped into Windlass, wiping out a portion of Windlasss side railing. However, the damage was insignificant, and as the battleship slowly returned to the harbor, the band played Missouri Waltz, Anchors <b>Aweigh,</b> and Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen. Crewmen also hoisted battle flags and hoisted signal flags which read [...] "Reporting for Duty". A Norfolk harbor pilot was responsible for issuing the engine and rudder orders to the battleship, while Missouris own navigator issued course orders for the battleship during the tow.|$|E
500|$|During {{his last}} year at MGM, Hanna {{branched}} out into television, forming the short-lived company Shield Productions with fellow animator Jay Ward, [...] who had created the series Crusader Rabbit. Their partnership soon ended, and in 1957 Hanna reteamed with Joseph Barbera to produce cartoons for television and theatrical release. The two brought different skills to the company; Barbera was a skilled gag writer and sketch artist, while Hanna had a gift for timing, story construction, and recruiting top artists. Major business decisions would be made together, though each year the title of president alternated between them. A coin toss determined that Hanna would have precedence in the naming of the new company, first called H-B Enterprises but soon changed to Hanna–Barbera Productions.

500|$|Lois mocking [...] (or, as it {{is called}} in the scene, Stymie Gruffin: The Untold Story), citing the movie as a middle finger to the {{audience}} by being three episodes slapped together under the guise of a movie (followed by Brian calling in two bodyguards in suits to take Lois away) was edited on TV for time reasons. A deleted scene showed one of Peter's crimes being a hate crime, where during his stunt he hit a car with a Jewish driver. The televised scene changed the Jewish driver to a female virgin driver and the crime being a rape (her airbag having busted her hymen when it deployed) and not a hate crime. The scene of Stewie getting high on NyQuil to cope with losing Rupert and mistaking a throw pillow for a cat was cut from TV airings for time reasons. David Goodman noted that he feels the production crew may not have succeeded on this episode as everything falls into place easily, such as the box falling out of the moving truck. Every frame when Stewie is dancing in a montage of Anchors <b>Aweigh</b> took a large amount of work to produce.|$|E
500|$|Modeled {{after the}} Puss Gets the Boot {{characters}} with slight differences, the series followed Jerry, the pesky rodent who continuously outwitted his feline foe, Tom. Hanna said they {{settled on the}} cat and mouse theme for this cartoon because [...] "we knew we needed two characters. We thought we needed conflict, and chase and action. And a cat after a mouse seemed like a good, basic thought." [...] The revamped characters first appeared in 1941's The Midnight Snack. Over the next 17 years, Barbera and Hanna worked exclusively on Tom and Jerry, directing more than 114 popular cartoon shorts. During World War II, they also made animated training films. Tom and Jerry relied mostly on motion instead of dialog. [...] Despite its popularity, Tom and Jerry has often been criticized as excessively violent. [...] Nonetheless, the series won its first Academy Award for the 11th short, The Yankee Doodle Mouse (1943)—a war-time adventure. Tom and Jerry was ultimately nominated for 14 Academy Awards, winning 7. No other character-based theatrical animated series has won more awards, nor has any other series featuring the same characters. Tom and Jerry also made guest appearances in several of [...] MGM's live-action films, including Anchors <b>Aweigh</b> (1945) and Invitation to the Dance (1956) with Gene Kelly, and Dangerous When Wet (1953) with Esther Williams.|$|E
500|$|After Minogue parted {{ways with}} Deconstruction Records, she {{performed}} {{a duet with}} the Pet Shop Boys' on their Nightlife album and spent several months in Barbados performing in Shakespeare's The Tempest. She then appeared in the film Sample People and recorded a cover version of Russell Morris's [...] "The Real Thing" [...] for the soundtrack. In April 1999, she signed with Parlophone Records, which wanted to re-establish Minogue as a pop artist. In September 2000, Minogue released her seventh studio album, Light Years. The album was a collection of dance songs, influenced by disco music. It generated strong reviews and was successful throughout Australia, Asia, Europe and New Zealand. The lead single, [...] "Spinning Around", became her first {{number one in the}} United Kingdom in ten years, and its accompanying video featured Minogue in revealing gold hot pants, which came to be regarded as a [...] "trademark". The second single, [...] "On a Night Like This" [...] reached number one in Australia and number two in the United Kingdom. [...] "Kids", a duet with Robbie Williams, also peaked at number two in the United Kingdom. She then embarked on the On a Night Like This Tour, which played to sell-out crowds in Australia and the United Kingdom. The tour incorporated Burlesque and theatre and cited the style of Broadway shows such as 42nd Street, films such as Anchors <b>Aweigh,</b> South Pacific, the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals of the 1930s and the live performances of Bette Midler as inspiration. Minogue was praised for her new material and her reinterpretations of some of her greatest successes. She won a [...] "Mo Award" [...] for Australian live entertainment as [...] "Performer of the Year". She also appeared in the 2001 film, Moulin Rouge! as [...] "The Green Fairy".|$|E

2500|$|In Kelly's next film, Anchors <b>Aweigh</b> (1945), MGM {{gave him}} a free hand to devise a range of dance routines, {{including}} his duets with co-star Frank Sinatra and the celebrated animated dance with Jerry Mouse [...] the animation for which was supervised by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. That iconic performance was enough for Farber to completely reverse his previous assessment of Kelly's skills. Reviewing the film, Farber enthused, [...] "Kelly is the most exciting dancer to appear in Hollywood movies."

2500|$|... "Anchors aweigh" [...] {{is often}} misspelled as [...] "Anchor's away," [...] leading to {{confusion}} {{of the terms}} and the misunderstanding that it means [...] "to drop anchor." [...] Another confusion {{is evident in the}} spellings encountered both with and without an apostrophe. Here, {{it is a matter of}} distinguishing the singular anchor + contraction of [...] "is" [...] (that is, [...] "anchor's aweigh") from the plural (anchors <b>aweigh),</b> meaning the anchors of all ships are raised. Although the original (now archaic) [...] "aweigh" [...] is verbal and transitive, the [...] "aweigh" [...] used now is adjectival/adverbial in nature and meaning.|$|E

In 2014, the Delphian Choir received second place in the prestigious American Prize in Choral Performance (high school/youth choir division). The school's theme song is Anchors <b>Aweigh.</b> It is not clear why this theme song was chosen by the school, but it was in use as early as 1924. Some speculate that the theme might have been chosen to honor a graduate who served in the United States Navy during World War I, or because the school colors are Navy blue and white. (The school's lyrics to the piece closely mimic the first stanza of the original lyrics to the Navy song.) ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And I am {{bound to}} sea," [...] he soon said. [...] "The wind is getting fresh, and your boat, which I see, at this moment, {{standing}} {{in for the}} islands, will {{find it difficult to}} make way against its force. The Coquette's anchor will be <b>aweigh,</b> in twenty minutes; and I shall find two hours of an ebbing tide, and a top-gallant breeze, but too short a time for the pleasure of entertaining such guests. I am certain that the fears of la Belle will favor my wishes, whichsoever side of the question her inclinations may happen to be." ...|$|E
60|$|The anchor was {{no sooner}} <b>aweigh,</b> than the deck became {{a scene of}} activity. The breeze was stiff, and it enabled me to show the Wallingford off to {{advantage}} among the dull, flat-bottomed craft of that day. There were reaches in which the wind favoured us, too; and, {{by the time the}} ladies reappeared, we were up among the islands, worming our way through the narrow channels with rapidity and skill. To me, and to Marble also, the scene was entirely novel; and between the activity that our evolutions required, and the constant change of scene, we had little leisure to attend to those in the cabin. Just as breakfast was announced, indeed, the vessel was approaching the more difficult part of the river; and all we got of that meal, we took on deck, at snatches, between the many tacks we made. As good-luck would have it, however, the wind backed more to the westward about eight o'clock; and we were enabled to stem the ebb that began to make at the same time. This gave us the hope of reaching the end of our passage without again anchoring.|$|E
60|$|Sail {{was made}} on board the Swash with great rapidity, and the brig made a bold push at the Stepping-Stones. Spike was a capital pilot. He insisted if he could once gain sight of the spar that was moored on those rocks for a buoy, he should run with great confidence. The two lights were of great assistance, of course; but the revenue vessel could see these lights {{as well as the}} brig, and she, doubtless, had an {{excellent}} pilot on board. By the time the studding-sails were set on board the Swash, the steamer was <b>aweigh,</b> and her long line of peculiar sails became visible. Unfortunately for men who were in a hurry, she lay so much within the bluff as to get the wind scant, and her commander thought it necessary to make a stretch over to the southern shore, before he attempted to lay his course. When he was ready to tack, an operation of some time with a vessel of her great length, the Swash was barely visible in the obscurity, gliding off upon a slack bowline, at a rate which nothing but the damp night air, the ballast-trim of the vessel, united to her excellent sailing qualities, could have produced with so light a breeze.|$|E
60|$|By this time, {{our last}} anchor was <b>aweigh,</b> {{and the ship}} was clear of the bottom. The top-sails had been hoisted before I went aloft, and {{everything}} was now ready for filling away. Too anxious to go on deck, under such circumstances, and a lofty position being the best for ascertaining the presence of rocks, I determined to remain where I was, and conn the ship through the passes, in my own person. An order was accordingly given to set the jib, and to swing the head-yards, and get the spanker on the ship. In a minute, the Crisis was again in motion, moving steadily towards the inlet. As the lagoon was not entirely free from danger, coral rocks rising in places quite near {{the surface of the}} water, I was obliged to be attentive to the pilot's duty, until we got into the outer bay, when this particular danger in a great measure disappeared. I could then look about me with more freedom. Though we so far changed our position, as respected the wreck, as to open new views of it, no launch was to be seen behind it. By the time the ship reached the passage through the reef, I had little hope of finding it there.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{provided}} for, Mulford {{decided that}} the time had arrived when he ought to quit his anchorage. He had been employed most of that morning in getting the schooner's anchor, a work of great toil to him, though everybody had assisted. He had succeeded, and the vessel now rode by a kedge, that he could easily weigh {{by means of a}} deck tackle. It remained now, therefore, to lift this kedge and to stand out of the bay of the islets. No sooner was the boat secured astern, and its freight disposed of, than the mate began to make sail. In order to hoist the mainsail well up, he was obliged to carry the halyards to the windlass. Thus aided, he succeeded without much difficulty. He and Jack Tier and Biddy got the jib hoisted by hand; and as for the fore-sail, that would almost set itself. Of course, it was not touched until the kedge was <b>aweigh.</b> Mulford found little difficulty in lifting the last, and he soon had the satisfaction of finding his craft clear of the ground. As Jack Tier was every way competent to take charge of the forecastle, Mulford now sprang aft, and took his own station at the helm; Rose acting as his pretty assistant on the quarter-deck.|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} the Plantagenet's top-sails were {{beginning}} to dip from the cliffs, the Carnatic, the Thunderer, the Blenheim, the Achilles, and the Warspite were all stretching out in line, with intervals of quite two leagues between them, under as much canvass as they could now bear. The admiral had shortened sail the most, and was evidently allowing the Carnatic to close, most probably {{on account of the}} threatening look of the sky, to windward; while he was suffering the frigate and sloop, the Chloe and Driver, to pass ahead of him, the one on his weather, and the other on his lee bow. When the Dover weighed, the admiral's upper sail was not visible from her tops, though the Warspite's hull had not yet disappeared from her deck. She left the fleet, or the portions of it that still remained at anchor, with her fore-course set, and hauled by the wind, under double-reefed top-sails, a single reef in her main-sail, and with her main-topgallant sail set over its proper sail. With this reduced canvass, she started away on the track of her consorts, the brine foaming under her bows, and with a heel that denoted the heavy pressure that bore on her sails. By this time, the York was <b>aweigh,</b> the tide had turned, and it became necessary to fill on the other tack in order to clear the land to the eastward. This altered the formation, but we will now revert to the events as they transpired on the shore, with a view to relate them more in their regular order.|$|E
6000|$|We were near, or quite, a {{fortnight}} in quarantine; {{after which the}} ship dropped down abreast of the town. This was of a Saturday, and Sunday, {{a portion of the}} crew were permitted to go ashore. Bill was of the number, and when he returned he admitted that he had been so much excited at finding himself in the place, that he had been a little indiscreet. That night he was very uncomfortable, but nothing occurred to molest any of us. The next morning all seemed right, and Bill began to be himself again; often wishing, however, that the anchor was <b>aweigh,</b> and the ship turning out of the harbour. We soon got at work, and began to work down to the mouth of the haven, with a light breeze. The moment we were clear of the points, or head-lands, we could make a fair wind of it up channel. The ship was in stays, pretty well down, tinder Pendennis, and the order had been given to swing the head yards. Bill and Cooper were pulling together at the fore-top-sail brace, when the report of a musket was heard quite near the ship. Bill let go the brace, turned as white as a sheet, and exclaimed, [...] "I'm gone!" [...] At first, the men near him thought he was shot, but a gesture towards the boat which had fired, explained his meaning. The order was given to belay the head braces, and we waited the result in silence.|$|E
60|$|A frigate came in, and {{anchored}} {{just ahead}} of us. She lowered a boat, and sent a reefer alongside to inform us that she was His Majesty's ship----; that she had lost all her anchors but the stream, and she might strike adrift, and he advised us {{to get out of}} her way. The captain held on that day, however, but next morning she came into us, sure enough. The ships did not get clear without some trouble, and we thought it wisest to shift our berth. Once <b>aweigh,</b> the captain thought it best to turn out of the Downs, which we did, working through the Straits, and anchoring under Dungeness, as soon as the flood made. Here we lay until near sunset, when we got under way to try our hand upon the ebb. I believe the skipper had made up his mind to tide it down to the Land's End, rather than remain idle any longer. There was a sloop of war lying in-shore of us, a mile or so, and just as we stretched out from under the land, she began to telegraph with a signal station ashore. Soon after, she weighed, and came out, also. In the middle watch we passed this ship, on opposite tacks, and learned that an embargo had been laid, and that we had only saved our distance by some ten or fifteen minutes! This embargo was to prevent the intelligence of the Copenhagen expedition from reaching the Danes. That very day, we passed a convoy of transports, carrying a brigade from Pendennis Castle to Yarmouth, in order to join the main fleet. A gun-brig brought us to, and came near pressing the Swede, under the pretence that being allies of his king, England had a right to his services. Had not the man been as obstinate as a bull, and positively refused to go, I do believe we should have lost him. He was ordered into the boat at least half-a-dozen times, but swore he would not budge. Cooper had a little row with this boarding officer, but was silenced by the captain.|$|E
