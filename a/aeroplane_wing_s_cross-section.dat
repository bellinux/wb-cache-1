40|$|Perturbed {{eigenvalue}} equations up to fourth-order {{are established}} to detect structural damage in <b>aeroplane</b> <b>wing.</b> Complete set of perturbation terms including orthogonal and non-orthogonal coefficients are computed using perturbed eigenvalue and orthonormal equations. Then the perturbed eigenparameters are optimized using BFGS approach. Finite element model with small to large stepwise damage {{is used to}} represent actual <b>aeroplane</b> <b>wing.</b> In small damaged level, termination number {{is the same for}} both approaches, while rms errors and termination d-norms are very close. For medium damaged level, termination number is larger for third-order perturbation with lower d-norm and smaller rms error. In large damaged level, termination number is much larger for third-order perturbation with same d-norm and larger rms error. These trends are more significant as the damaged level increases. As the stepwise damage effect increases with damage level, the increase in stepwise effect leads to the increase in model order. Hence, fourth-order perturbation is more accurate to estimate the model solution...|$|R

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{properties of}} bird wings were examined at Reynolds numbers of 1 - 5 x io 4 and {{were correlated with}} morphological parameters such as apsect ratio, camber, nose radius and position of maximum thickness. The many qualitative differences between the aerodynamic properties of bird, insect and <b>aeroplane</b> <b>wings</b> are attributable mainly to their differing Reynolds numbers. Bird wings, which operate at lower Reynolds numbers than aero-foils, have high minimum drag coefficients (o>o 3 -o-i 3), low maximum lift coefficients (o- 8 -i- 2) and low maximum lift/drag ratios (3 - 17). Bird and insect wings have low aerofoil efficiency factors (0 - 2 - 0 - 8) compared to conventional aerofoils (0 - 9 - 0 - 95) because of their low Reynolds numbers and high profile drag, rather than because of a reduced mechanical efficiency of animal wings. For bird wings there is clearly a trade-off between lift and drag perform-ance. Bird wings with low drag generally had low maximum lift coefficients whereas wings with high maximum lift coefficients had high drag coefficients. The pattern of air flow over bird wings, as indicated by pressure-distribution data, is consistent with aerodynamic theory for <b>aeroplane</b> <b>wings</b> at low Reynolds numbers, and with the observed lift and drag coefficients...|$|R

50|$|Turbulent {{boundary}} layers {{tend to be}} able {{to sustain}} an adverse pressure gradient better than an equivalent laminar boundary layer. The more efficient mixing which occurs in a turbulent boundary layer transports kinetic energy {{from the edge of the}} boundary layer to the low momentum flow at the solid surface, often preventing the separation which would occur for a laminar boundary layer under the same conditions. This physical fact has led to a variety of schemes to actually produce turbulent boundary layers when boundary layer separation is dominant at high Reynolds numbers. The dimples on a golf ball, the fuzz on a tennis ball, or the seams on a baseball are good examples. <b>Aeroplane</b> <b>wings</b> are often engineered with vortex generators on the upper surface to produce a turbulent boundary layer.|$|R
